Sit--
Here.
Sit here child.
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Beth!
- Merry Christmas, Beth!
I should have given it to you long ago.
It belonged to my little girl... who had to leave us when she was very young.
But now, it will make music again.
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.
Play something, Beth.
Shall I?
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la La la la la
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la La la la la
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa la la la la la La la la
Troll the ancient yuletide carol
Fa la la la la La la la la
See the blazing yule before us
Fa la la la la La la la la
Strike the harp and join the chorus
Fa la la la la La la la la
Follow me in merry measure
Fa la la la la la La la la
While I tell of yuletide treasure
Fa la la la la La la la la
That was good.
I fear you would have a long engagement.
Three or four years.
John must secure a house before you can marry... and he must do a service to the Union.
John?
Marry?
You mean that pokey old Mr. Brooke?
How did he weasel his way into this family?
John has been very kind to go visit father in the hospital every day.
He's dull as powder.
Meg, can't you at least marry someone amusing?
I'm fond of Mr. Brooke.
He's a good man.
He's kind and serious... and I'm not afraid of being poor.
Marmee, you can't just let her go and marry him.
I'd hardly just go and marry anyone.
I would rather Meg marry for love and be a poor man's wife... than marry for riches and lose her self-respect.
So you don't mind that John is poor?
No, but I would rather he have a house.
Why must we marry at all?
Why can't things just stay as they are?
It is only a proposal.
Nothing need be decided.
Now, girls... let's not spoil the day.
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn king
Glory to the newborn king
Peace on earth
- Father?
- And mercy mild
- Father!
- Merry Christmas, everyone.
What a wonderful Christmas present!
Oh, Father, you're home!
Oh, you're more handsome than ever!
Beth, my little cookie.
Thank God you're well.
Give the man room to breathe.
Jo!
Oh, my wild girl!
Well, this could become the fashion.
- Watch his arm.
Be careful.
- I'm not used to this.
Be very careful now.
Don't coddle this soldier too much.
Oh, Father!
Hannah, God bless you.
It's good to see you.
It's good to have you home, Mr. March.
Now, let me look at my girls.
Take them and give them--
The cholera took more men than the rebs, as I understand it, sir.
Agriculture isn't taught, and it should be.
It should be required.
Perhaps the freedmen should be given land in the West.
- What happened between you and John?
- Never you mind.
Isn't it wonderful, Jo?
Yes, it's wonderful.
Welcome home, soldier.
Would you like some water, sir?
From our birth
Over and around us lies
Lord of all to Thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise
Change will come as surely as the seasons and twice as quick.
We make our peace with it as best we can... or as Amy once said when she was still a little girl:
"We'll all grow up someday.
We might as well know what we want. "
Sun and moon and stars of light
Lord of all to Thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise
Lord of all to Thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise
So you feel our Amy has talent?
Oh, Miss March excels at drawing... but, you know, her landscapes lack emotion.
I definitely feel Amy would benefit from further study... but she won't get it around here.
Where do you suggest?
Cape Cod has a fine artist colony... but Europe is the best place.
Your houseman said you wouldn't be home till night.
- I couldn't wait so long.
- Hail the conquering graduate!
Is Grandfather exceedingly proud?
Yes, and exceedingly bent on locking me up in one of his offices.
Why is it Amy may paint china and you can scribble away... while I must manfully set my music aside?
Why must you?
If I don't...
I'd have to defy Grandfather.
Yes, and not the whole of society.
I can't go against the old man.
When I imagine myself in that life...
I can think of only one thing... that would make me happy.
Oh, no, Teddy.
Teddy, don't.
No, wait, Teddy.
We have to talk about this reasonably.
I have loved you... since the moment I clamped eyes on you.
Would could be more reasonable than to marry you?
- We'd kill each other.
- Nonsense.
- Neither of us can keep our temper.
- I can... unless provoked.
We're both stupidly stubborn, especially you.
- We'd only quarrel.
- I wouldn't!
You can't even propose without quarreling.
Dear Jo, I swear I'll be a saint.
I'll let you win every argument.
I'll take care of you and your family.
I'll give you every luxury you've ever been denied.
You won't have to write unless you want to.
Grandfather... wants me to learn the business in England.
Can't you see us bashing around London?
London.
Oh, Teddy, I'm not fashionable enough for London.
You need someone who's elegant and refined.
I want you.
Teddy, please, don't ask me.
- Teddy, I'm desperately sorry.
- No.
- I do care for you...
- No.
with all of my heart.
You're my dearest friend.
I just can't go be a wife.
You say you won't, but... you will.
I won't.
One day... you'll meet some man.
A good man.
And you will love him tremendously.
And you will live and die for him.
- Teddy, please.
- You will.
I know you.
And I'll be hanged... if I stand by and watch.
Jo, are you ill?
She has refused Laurie.
Well, I'm sure she can take it back.
It's just a misunderstanding.
Listen to him.
I must get away.
Of course.
Aunt March is going to France.
France!
That's ideal!
I'll put up with anything to go!
Aunt March has asked me to go.
To Europe?
My Europe?
When?
It was decided just today.
Well, I am her companion now.
She wishes me to study painting abroad... in hopes I might make a good match there.
But perhaps she wouldn't mind if you stayed at Plumfield... while we are gone.
Of course Aunt March prefers Amy over me.
Why shouldn't she?
I'm ugly and awkward, and I always say the wrong things.
I fly around throwing away perfectly good marriage proposals.
I love our home, but I'm just so fitful that I can't stand being here!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Marmee.
There's just something really wrong with me.
I want to change, but I can't... and I just know I'll never fit in anywhere.
Jo, you have so many extraordinary gifts.
How can you expect to lead an ordinary life?
You're ready to go out and find a good use for your talent.
Although I don't know what I shall do without my Jo.
Go... and embrace your liberty... and see what wonderful things come of it.
Laurie sought his refuge in London and abroad.
Marmee helped me find a place in the great city of New York... and so I stepped over the divide between childhood and all that lay beyond.
Mrs. Kirk?
Josephine!
- Yes.
How do you do?
- Kitty, Minnie.
This is Miss March.
Her father was Colonel March.
He knew your papa.
- It was cold.
- Watch your feet, Mr. Costigan.
- Do come in, my dear.
- You're making that up.
Dear Beth:
Marmee's friend, Mrs. Kirk, has made me feel quite at home.
My little students, Kitty and Minnie, are dear girls.
How curious to grow up in a busy boarding house... with no father and your own mother the innkeeper.
I felt bold on leaving Concord... but I confess I find New York rough and strange... and myself strange in it.
Please pass these down the table.
Thank you kindly, Professor.
Mrs. Kirk believes that I am here... for a brief interlude of sensational experience... before succumbing to a matrimonial fate.
Excuse me, miss.
And while there is surely no lack of sensational experience... of every kind available in such a city...
- Come in!
- I hope, though I've had no luck yet... that any experience I gain here will be strictly literary... and that all events of a romantic or sensational nature... will be entirely confined to the page.
Our subscribers are not interested in sentiment and fairy stories, miss.
They're not fairy stories.
Try one of the ladies' magazines.
- Come on, Will!
Hurry up!
- I'm coming!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so clumsy.
You know that when first I saw you, I thought...
"Ah!
She is a writer."
What made you think so?
Yes, I know many writers.
In Berlin I was professor at the university.
Here I am just a humble tutor, I'm afraid.
Please, sit down.
Thank you.
You are far from home, Miss March?
- Do you miss your family?
- Oh, very much.
My sisters especially.
And Laurie.
She is your sister?
No, he's a friend.
You like your coffee?
Oh, it's... just very strong.
I like it.
You have quite a library.
Did you bring all these books from Germany?
A few of them.
- May I?
- Of course.
Most of these I could not bear to leave behind.
I sold everything that I own to get my passage to come here... but my books... never.
Shakespeare.
Some books are so familiar.
Reading them is like being home again.
Will you be returning to Berlin, Professor Bhaer?
Friedrich.
Call me Friedrich.
Friedrich.
No.
Sadly, the fatherland of Goethe and Schiller... is no more.
I adore Goethe.
My father used to read me all the German poets when I was a child.
Really?
That is most surprising.
My mother and father were part of... a rather unusual circle in Concord.
Do you know the word "transcendentalist"?
But this is German romantic philosophy.
We throw off all our constraints and we come to know ourselves... through insight and experience.
It got out of fashion now.
Not in the March family, I'm afraid.
It's just that with all of this transcendence... comes much emphasis on perfecting oneself.
This gives you a problem?
I'm hopelessly flawed.
If only we could... transcend ourselves without perfection.
Like your poet, Walt Whitman... who rides up and down the streets of Broadway all day... shouting poetry against the roar of the carts.
" Keep your silent woods, O Nature...
- "And your quiet places by the river--
- And your quiet places by the woods... by the woods.
Give me the streets of Manhattan."
I think we are all hopelessly flawed.
He is as poor as one might imagine an itinerant philosopher to be.
Yet, as the weeks go by, I see that he is unfailingly generous... to all of us who live in the house.
I am grateful to have a friend.
It is the system our nation was founded on.
Come now.
It was nothing short of a betrayal of our country's ideals.
Our country's ideals?
A constitution... that denies the basic rights of citizenship to women and black people?
They just passed the 15th Amendment, Jacob.
- They can vote.
- Black men can vote, Charles.
A lady has no need of suffrage if she has a husband.
- You don't take wine?
- Only medicinally.
Pretend that you've got a cold.
I agree, but if women are a moral force... shouldn't they have the right to govern and preach and testify in court?
What is it, Miss March?
I find it poor logic to say that because women are good... women should vote.
Men do not vote because they are good.
They vote because they are male.
And women should vote not because they are angels and men are animals... but because we are human beings and citizens of this country.
You should have been a lawyer, Miss March.
I should have been a great many things, Mr. Mayer.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, please.
Please, come in.
I have some good news.
A newspaper has published two of my stories, and they wish to see more.
This is wonderful.
Right there.
- The Daily Volcano?
- Yes.
"The Sinner's Corpse"... by Joseph March.
Lunatics.
Vampires.
This interests you?
People like thrilling stories, Friedrich.
This is what the newspapers want.
Yes.
Yes, I suppose.
I suppose that is true.
It will buy a new coat for Beth, and I'm sure she'll be grateful to have it.
I do not want to be your teacher.
No, understand me.
I am saying only that you should please yourself.
My opinion is of no importance.
Do you forgive me?
- Of course.
- Then I make a gift.
An experience.
Do you like the opera?
Oh, I do.
I mean, I think I do.
We don't seem to get a lot of opera in Concord.
I don't have an opera dress.
You will be perfect.
Where we are sitting, we shall not be so... formal.
Leila is a goddess.
She has made a promise never to love.
If she breaks her vow, all will be lost.
Oh, look.
Trouble is coming.
- What's going to happen?
- The inevitable.
Leila's soul is opening.
She's drawn to an idea.
He says, " Love has a fatal power."
Your heart... understood mine.
In the depth of the fragrant night...
I listened with ravished soul... to your beloved voice.
Your heart understood mine.
Oh, Laurie!
You wicked!
We heard you were in Greece or somewhere.
Laurie!
Come!
Come!
You've been much occupied with business, I am sure.
I'm not pursuing business just now.
Grandfather agreed I should concentrate... on my music for a while.
You know Fred Vaughan?
- Freddy.
- Good day, Laurence.
Yes.
I see you've taken up a passion for art, Freddy.
Aunt March, you look splendid.
I cannot say the same for you, my boy.
Amy dear.
- Will you be long?
I must retire.
- Yes, Aunt March.
Do come see us.
- Are they engaged?
- Not yet.
Hop, hop.
One, two, three, four.
Hop, hop, hop, turn.
Friedrich, how long would it take strychnine to dissolve in brandy?
Oh.
About eight minutes?
And is a dagger worn at the waist, or is that a saber?
I think that in these novels... the dagger is usually concealed in the boot... by a man with a dark moustache.
Go this way.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Oh, Laurie, how lovely.
It isn't what it should be, but you have improved it.
Please don't.
I liked you much better when you were blunt and natural.
It did not serve me well.
I find you changed.
In fact, I despise you.
You laze about spending your family's money and courting women.
You aren't serious about music.
My compositions are like your paintings:
mediocre copies of another man's genius.
Then why don't you go to Grandfather in London and make yourself useful?
I should.
Why don't you reform me?
I've someone more practical in mind.
You do not love Fred Vaughan.
Fred Vaughan is stable and well-mannered--
And has 40,000 a year.
I've always known I would not marry a pauper.
I expect a proposal any day.
You'll regret it.
I'll regret it.
I'm reminded of a promise.
Didn't I say I would kiss you before you die?
Do you hear from Jo?
She has befriended a German professor.
Yes.
No doubt he's showing her... the ways of the world.
I do not wish to be courted by someone who is still in love with my sister!
I'm not in love with Jo.
Then how do you explain your jealousy?
I envy her happiness.
I envy his happiness.
I envy John Brooke for marrying Meg.
I hate Fred Vaughan.
If Beth had a lover, I would despise him too.
Just as you have always known you would never marry a pauper...
I have always known...
I should be part of the March family.
I do not wish to be loved for my family.
Any more than Fred Vaughan wishes to be loved for his 40,000 a year.
My darling Amy.
It is you I want and not your family.
I've gone to London to make myself worthy of you.
Please, do not do anything we shall regret.
Monsieur Vaughan, mademoiselle.
May I show him in?
- Friedrich, did you read it?
- Yes.
It's well written, Jo.
And the first novel.
What a great accomplishment.
I'm going to be showing it to your publisher friend, Mr. Fields, today.
He liked "The Sinner's Corpse."
What is it?
Mr. Fields is a good man.
He will give you an honest opinion.
Oh, I see.
What is your honest opinion?
- I'm a professor of philosophy.
- No, I'd like to know what you think.
You should be writing from life... from the depths of your soul.
There is nothing in here of the woman that I am privileged to know.
Friedrich, this is what I write.
My apologies if it fails to live up to your high standards.
Jo, there is more to you than this... if you have the courage to write it.
Why didn't you tell me?
One hardly speaks of such things.
Oh, how wonderful.
How is Beth?
You will find her much altered.
Marmee.
She wouldn't let us send for you sooner.
The doctor has been here a number of times... but it's beyond all of us, and I think--
I think she's been waiting for you... before--
You're going to drink up all of this good broth.
I'm glad you're home.
So am I.
" Mr. Pickwick changed color.
'Ah,' said Mr. Wartle.
'Well, that's important.
There's nothing suspicious then, I suppose."'
I feel stronger with you close by.
I'm going to get you better yet.
If God wants me with Him, there is none who will stop Him.
I don't mind.
I was never like the rest of you... making plans about the great things I'd do.
I never saw myself as anything much.
Not a great writer like you.
Beth, I'm not a great writer.
But you will be.
Oh, Jo, I've missed you so.
Why does everyone want to go away?
I love being home.
But I don't like being left behind.
Now I am the one going ahead.
I am not afraid.
I can be brave like you.
But I know I shall be homesick for you... even in heaven.
I won't let you go.
Oh, my Jo.
Aunt March is bedridden and would not survive a sea voyage.
Amy must bide her time and return later.
It's just as well.
Will we never all be together again?
Lovely morning.
Thank you, sir.
Dearest Laurie:
You may not have heard our sad news of Beth's--
" Meg has entered her confinement... and poor Amy must stay in Vevey with Aunt March."
This is far too great a sorrow to bear alone.
Please come home to us, Teddy dear.
Your faithful, Jo.
I knew you would come.
The real charm of it lay in Beth's happy face... as she leaned over the new piano and lovingly touched... the beautiful black and white keys.
During the next few minutes, the rumor circulated... that Amy March had got 24 delicious limes.
I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you... that they powdered and squeezed and made me look a fashion plate.
As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet.
A general outcry arose, for all her abundant hair was cut short.
Jo, how could you?
Your one beauty.
Nothing's going to change, Jo.
For the beauty of the earth
For the glory of the skies
For the love which from our birth
Over and around us lies
Lord of all to Thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise
Surprise!
John, you have a daughter.
And a son.
Oh, Marmee, I can't believe you did this four times.
Yes, but never two at once, my darling.
Oh, Daisy.
Oh, Meg, she's so beautiful.
And him.
He is handsome.
He's going to look just like his papa when he grows up.
Yes, he does look like John.
Have you heard from the professor?
We did not part well.
John and I don't always agree, but then we mend it.
Who could that be?
Oh, this is magic!
You are absolutely--
Covered in flour!
Oh, dear!
- Come in.
- No, Jo, not yet.
May I tell you something without the others?
You're my dear friend.
I'm glad that you shall be the first to know.
- What?
- May I present... my wife.
Oh, my!
- Here, flowers.
- Thank you.
Come in!
Brussels lace!
Oh!
I went to Europe to paint the great cathedrals... but I couldn't get our home out of my mind.
Oh, look how Amy has captured Orchard House.
- Lovely.
- Oh, it's beautiful.
Not as beautiful as I wanted, but I am still learning.
Dear little angel.
Jo, you must tell me the truth, as a sister... which is a relation stronger than marriage.
Do you mind at all?
Oh, no.
I was surprised.
Mind you, I had it on good authority that our Teddy... would never love another.
And now he's gone and gotten married.
It's good to hear you call me Teddy again.
At last, we're all family, as we always should have been.
You must promise me that you will always live close by.
I couldn't bear losing another sister.
Jo, it's so gloomy and chilly.
One would require an income just for the coal to heat this place.
What could the dear old girl have been thinking?
Most likely she felt sorry for me.
Decrepit homeless spinster!
Oh, poor Aunt.
Living here all those years alone in this useless old house.
Yes, her blessings became a burden because she couldn't share them.
Wouldn't this have made a wonderful school?
A school.
What a challenge that would be.
Hello, Tuppy.
Hello.
Good boy.
My book!
Someone's publishing my book.
- Someone's publishing my book!
- Heaven help us!
It came with no letter.
How did it arrive?
Foreign gentleman brung it.
Strange kind of name.
Can't think of it.
Oh, Fox, or Bear or such.
Bhaer!
Did you ask him to wait?
I thought he was one of Miss Amy's European friends... coming with a wedding gift.
I said, " Miss March and Mr. Laurie are living next door."
- Hannah, you didn't!
- Then he said he had a train to catch.
Friedrich!
Oh, Friedrich, thank you for my book.
When I didn't hear from you...
I thought you hated it.
Oh, no.
Reading your book was like opening a window... into your heart.
James Fields took it out of my hands, and he would not give it back to me.
I said, "Such news I have to give to her myself."
Well, it was a silly impulse.
No, not silly at all.
It's so good to see you.
- Come and meet my family.
- No, I--
Thank you, but...
I have to catch a train.
I am going to the West.
My ship leaves from Boston tomorrow morning.
Yes, the schools in the West are young.
They need professors and... they are not so concerned about the accent.
I don't mind it either.
See, my aunt left me Plumfield.
It isn't a field.
It's a house, actually.
A rather large house.
And it isn't really good for anything except a school... and I want a good school... one that would be open to anyone who wanted to learn, and, well...
I'll be needing someone who knows how to teach.
Is there nothing I might say to keep you here?
I confess that I was hoping that I might have a reason... to stay, but... congratulations on the celebration of your marriage.
Oh, no!
No, that's Amy.
That's my sister.
Amy and Laurie, actually.
No, I'm not married.
Please don't go so far away.
Jo.
Such a little name for-- for such a person.
Will you have me?
With all of my heart!
But I have nothing to give you.
My hands are empty.
Not empty now.
- Is this too fast?
- Harder!
My sisters and I remember that winter... as the coldest of our childhood.
A temporary poverty had settled upon our family some years before.
The war had made fuel and lamp oil scarce.
But necessity is indeed the mother of invention.
Somehow in that dark time... our family, the March family, seemed to create its own light.
Marmee!
Marmee's home!
Marmee!
Marmee!
We waited and waited!
We've been "expectorating" you for hours!
- Have you, my darling?
- "Expecting," featherhead.
- Oh, Marmee, you're frozen!
- Yes.
If you could see the people lined up outside Hope House in this bitter cold.
- Mmm, your cheeks are so warm.
- Finished your Christmas bundles?
So many this year!
We were handing out--
- Oh, how is your cold?
- Better.
Good.
We were handing out food... as quickly as we could make up the baskets.
Now, Miss Amy, what is this in my pocket?
Father!
"My dearest family, I am well and safe.
Our battalion is encamped on the 'Potamac'."
- Potomac.
- Potomac.
"December makes a hard, cold season for all of us so far from home.
I think of my girls day and night... and find my best comfort in your affection.
I pray that your own hardships will not be too great to bear.
Give them all my dear love and a kiss.
Tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night."
- Poor Father.
- I'm a selfish girl.
Oh!
Little ones.
It's Christmas Eve.
Father wouldn't want us to be sad now.
Ding-dong merrily on high
In heaven the bells are ringing
In heaven the bells are ringing
Ding-dong merrily the sky is riven with angels singing
Glor-o-o-ria
Hosanna in excelsis
To bed, Miss Amy.
- Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
- Merry Christmas.
Let steeple bells be swungen
And i-o i-o i-o
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Glor-o-o-ria
Merry Christmas, Beth.
- Love you.
- I love you.
Hosanna in excelsis
My Jo.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Marmee.
Hosanna in excelsis
And don't sit up too late.
I won't.
May you beautifully rhyme your eve-time song ye singers
Late at night, my mind would come alive with voices and stories... and friends as dear to me as any in the real world.
I gave myself up to it, longing for transformation.
Oh, what miraculous food!
Isn't this just like the old days, Hannah?
Oh.
We shouldn't eat it.
We should just look at it.
I'm going to eat it.
Jo?
Jo, come down!
I'm awake!
Horrible piano.
Hannah's put together an absolute Christmas miracle.
Is that sausage?
Wait!
Oh, butter!
Oh, oh, isn't butter "divinity"?
Oh, God, thank you for this breakfast.
Jo, angel, fetch your Marmee.
She went out at the crack of dawn to see some Germans.
Hummel, the boy said.
Not a word of English.
His da's gone.
Six children, and she's 'bout to issue another.
May as well take 'em a stick of firewood.
Sure they haven't got any.
Or breakfast either.
Perhaps we could send the Hummels our bread.
Might as well send the butter too.
Butter's not much use... without bread to put it on.
Oh, wonderful snow!
Don't you wish you could roll about in it like dogs?
Once one of our finest families.
Lovely weather for a picnic!
Come along, Theodore.
We'll be late for church.
Jo, you should let them speak first.
What will they think of us?
Oh, don't look back!
Here we come a-wassailing among the leaves so green
And here we come a-wandering so fair as to be seen
Love and joy come to you And to you your wassail too
And God bless you and send you a happy new year
And God send you a happy new year
"Knights and ladies, elves and pages, monks and flower girls... all mingled gaily in the dance.
Pauline cried out in horror as her bridegroom's mask fell... disclosing not her lover Ferdinand... but the face of his sworn enemy, Count Antonio.
Revenge is mine, quoth he."
Continued in the following edition.
Excellent installment, Mr. Snodgrass.
- Oh, I love forbidden marriages!
- You ought to publish it, Jo.
Really!
Not just in the Pickwick Portfolio.
Mr. Tupman, are you demeaning our fine newspaper?
Mr. Winkle.
"One periwink--" Advertisement.
"One periwinkle sash belonging to Mr. N. Winkle... has been 'abscondated' from the wash line... which gentleman desires any reports leading to its recovery."
Gentlemen of the press, hear, hear!
I call to your attention... our Mr. Tupman's The History of the Squash.
Oh, don't read mine.
Beth, this isn't a story.
It's a recipe.
Oh, dear, I never know what to write.
First rule of writing, Mr. Tupman, is never write what you know.
What do we think of the boy?
Is he a captive like Smee in Nicholas Nickleby?
He looks lonely.
You don't think he'll try to call?
Maybe he has a secret-- a tragic, European secret.
He's had no upbringing at all they say.
He was reared in Italy among artists and vagrants.
Doesn't he have a noble brow?
If I were a boy, I'd want to look just like that.
Imagine giving up Italy to come live with that awful old man!
Jo, please don't say awful.
It's slang.
I'd be terrified to live with him.
I shouldn't mind living in such a fine house and having nice things.
Oh, it doesn't seen like Christmas this year without presents.
I'm desperate for drawing pencils.
I wish I didn't have to work for Great-Aunt March... that crabby old miser.
And you, Beth.
What's your Christmas wish?
I'd like the war to end so Father can come home.
Oh, sweet Beth.
We all want that.
They do have a beautiful piano.
Wait 'til I'm a writer.
I'll buy you the best piano in creation.
And if she doesn't, you can come over and play mine.
When I marry, I'm going to be disgustingly rich.
And what if the man you love is a poor man but good, like Father?
Well, it isn't like being stuck with the dreadful nose you get.
One does have a choice to whom one loves.
You have a lovely nose!
I wouldn't marry for the money.
I mean, what if his business goes bust?
Besides, down at the Eagle, they pay $5 for each story they print.
Why, I have ten stories in my head right now!
Gentlemen, I dislike all this money talk.
It isn't refined.
If lack of attention to personal finances is a mark of refinement... then I'd say the Marches are the most elegant family in Concord.
We'll all grow up someday, Meg.
We might as well know what we want.
That'll do.
Put the carriage away, and look smart about it.
Very good, sir.
Merry Christmas!
I have the most wonderful feeling about tonight.
Meg and Jo, you have to tell me...
"exquisitely" everything about Belle Gardiner.
What her nose looks like and about her ring.
Annie Gardiner says it's an emerald.
Can you imagine?
Everyone's lucky but me.
I'm glad I don't have to go and be with those frightening people... and try to think of things to say.
- Hush now.
- Oh, mind you, Jo... don't eat much at supper... and don't shake hands with people.
It isn't the thing anymore.
- Jo, your dress!
- Oh, I know!
You always stand too close to the fire.
Oh, dear.
Well, just keep your backside to the wall.
- Meg, look.
What cunning little heels.
- They're rather small.
That's all right.
It's only for one night.
You don't suppose anyone will notice... they came out of the rag bag, do you?
Uh-uh.
You have to have heels.
What's that strange smell?
Like burnt feathers.
- Heavens above!
- You've ruined me!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have had me do it!
- Meg, don't worry.
- I spoil everything.
- I can't go out like this!
- Good!
I'm not going either.
Here, we'll place my bow in front.
- Yes, that covers it.
- It's very becoming.
I'll never have any suitors.
I'll just be a dried-up old spinster.
You don't need scores of suitors.
You only need one, if he's the right one.
Listen to the child.
Meg isn't going to be married right away, is she?
With Jo's help, I never will.
- You must be so happy.
- Oh, Belle, it's enchanting.
Well, I best go help Mama.
Excuse me.
I think it's Mrs. Barkley.
She's going to try it.
Watch her.
Oh, yes, I would like it very much.
Jehoshaphat!
I'm sorry.
No, no, stay!
It's not a bad hiding place.
You see, I don't know anyone... so I feel awkward standing and staring at people.
Should I put on my jacket?
I never know the rules.
Um, um, I'm Laurie.
Theodore Laurence, but I'm, uh, I'm called Laurie.
Jo March.
Um--
So, who were you staring at?
Uh, you, actually.
What-- what game were you playing?
I don't know, but I think I won.
- Who else?
- Well, I was--
I was quite taken with that one.
That's Meg.
That's my sister.
She's completely bald in front.
Is it true that you lived in Italy among artists and vagrants?
My mother was Italian.
A, uh, pianist.
- Grandfather disapproved of her.
- Truly?
I saw a play like that once.
Do you like the theater?
- Oh, yes.
- Were you born there?
Where?
In-- In, uh, Italy.
- Do you speak French or Italian?
- English at home.
Francais a L 'ecole.
The Music Conservatory in Vevey.
But Grandfather's having me tutored now.
He insists I go to college.
Oh, I'd commit murder to go to college.
Ohh!
Actually, I'm going to Europe.
Well, at least I hope I am.
My Great-Aunt March says she'll go one of these days... and she has to take me with her because I work as her companion.
I have to read to her for hours and hours.
- But I do all the voices!
- I'll bet you do.
If I weren't going to be a writer...
I'd go to New York and pursue the stage.
- Are you shocked?
- Very.
I-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Meg always makes me take the gentleman's part at home.
It's a shame you don't know the lady's part.
Why are you looking at the back of my dress?
It isn't so bad!
Honestly.
You promised you wouldn't look.
Oh, Jo, I've sprained my ankle.
I shouldn't wonder in those shoes!
Does it hurt?
Oh.
Oh, no, no.
I'm quite well, thank you.
Well, this is our neighbor, Laurie, the captive.
Oh, poor Meg.
I'll go tell Mrs. Gardiner.
Oh, no, Jo.
She'll think I've been sampling the punch.
- A perfectly good party ruined.
- I have my carriage.
Let me take you home.
- Oh, yes!
- Oh, no, thank you.
Thank you.
Lean on me.
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.
That's very kind of you.
- Good-bye, Laurie.
- Good night, Mrs. March.
Wherever did you get this shoe?
Did you ride in his carriage?
Oh, you two have all the luck.
- Oh, Jo, is he very romantic?
- Not in the slightest!
We're very much obliged to him, but he's a dreadful boy.
He did a good deed putting snow on this ankle.
- He put snow on your ankle?
- To bed, Miss Amy.
- With his own hands?
- Oh, stop being so swoony.
I won't have my girls being silly about boys.
To bed, Jo, dear.
Does this hurt?
- Everything lovely happens to Meg.
- Oh, yes indeed!
You mustn't be soppy about Laurie anymore than you should be soppy... about those silly girls at school.
I hope we shall be good friends with him.
- With a boy?
- He isn't a boy!
He's Laurie!
Faster!
Faster!
Laurie!
Your young ladies are unusually active, Mrs. March, if I may say so.
You may indeed, Mr. Brooke.
It is my opinion that young girls are no different than boys... in their need for exertion.
Feminine weakness and fainting spells are the direct result... of our confining young girls to the house... bent over their needlework in restrictive corsets.
Marmee!
Your young student is an athlete.
He is, thank you, a good one.
But he makes an unruly scholar.
I regret that his grandfather is away much.
One hopes that your girls... will be a gentling influence.
Indeed, Mr. Brooke.
Marmee, must you speak to everyone about corsets?
Oh, Meg.
Do I?
Blast these wretched skirts!
Don't say blast and wretch.
Amy, don't be such a ninny-pinny.
I wish I was Beth so I could stay home and do pleasant things.
Oh, if you call doing laundry and housework pleasant!
Blast!
Amy, hurry.
I'll be late for work.
There's Mrs. King.
I'm tardy again.
Lovely children.
Oh, Meg, must I go to school?
I'm so "degradatated."
I can hardly hold my head up.
I owe at least a dozen limes.
- Limes?
- Are limes the fashion now?
Of course they are.
It's nothing but limes now.
Everyone keeps them in their desks and trades them for beads and things.
And all the girls treat each other at recess.
If you don't bring limes to school, you're nothing.
You might as well be dead.
I've had ever so many limes, and I can't pay anyone back.
No wonder you don't learn anything at that school!
I know how it feels to do without any little luxuries.
But we are not destitute, not yet.
Here's a quarter.
Marmee gave me the rag money this month.
Go on!
"Secondly, the immortality of the soul... is asserted to be in consequence... of its immateriality... as in all leipothymic cases... consistent with the idea of immortality... and immorality, and physicality--"
And I think you finally dozed off.
Josephine, there's a draft!
Is it Father?
Teacher struck me.
He put the limes out into the snow.
May Chester said my limes must have been donated to Hope House.
Then I said that she wouldn't get a single lime from me.
And then she told Mr. Davis they were hidden in my desk... and then he struck me.
We oughta go over there and beat the tar out of him with his own stick!
Jo, we must not embrace violence.
- I'll write this man a letter.
- A letter?
That'll show him.
You failed to mention to me they were forbidden.
A whole month's rag money?
- Amy, I shouldn't have given it to you.
- I'm sorry!
All those lovely limes.
I'm perfectly "desolated."
I'm not sorry you lost them.
It's a frivolous concern in times like these.
You are more intent upon reshaping your dear little nose... than in fashioning your character.
It's an appalling school.
Your spelling's atrocious... your Latin absurd.
Mr. Davis said it was as useful to educate a woman... as to educate a female cat.
I shall strangle Mr. Davis!
"Mr. Davis... what right have you to strike a child?
In God's eyes we are all children and we are all equals.
If you hit and humiliate a child, the only lesson she will learn... is to hit and humiliate."
Amy, do you think you can discipline yourself... to learn at home as Beth has done?
"I withdraw my daughter Amy from your school."
It serves the scoundrel right!
Jo will now supervise your education.
Jo, tell me what happens next... after the Duke turns his back on his family fortune and saves Lady Zara.
Don't know.
It's all murder and gore.
The damsel's in distress.
Oh, I love your damsels in distress.
Oh, Beth, truly, I don't know if I could ever be good like Marmee.
I rather crave violence.
If only I could be like Father... and go to war and stand up to the lions of injustice.
And so Marmee does in her own way.
Yes.
But I want to do something different!
I don't know what it is yet, but I'm on the watch for it.
You will find it, Jo.
Hello!
Jo!
Come over here.
You too, Meg.
It's dull as tombs around here.
Mr. Laurence, one doesn't shout at ladies as if they were cattle.
My apologies.
All right.
What do those girls do over there all day?
Over the mysteries of female life... there is drawn a veil best left undisturbed.
Oh, dear Countess, pray for me... for I have sinned against meself and me brother Rodrigo.
You've got to say sinned as if you've really sinned!
Sinned!
Sinned!
Rodrigo!
You arrive seeking the Duke of Lankershire.
Hark ye.
Who goes there?
Oh, I forgot the cymbals.
Why it's...
it's Rodrigo!
- Rodrigo?
- I want to be Lady Violet.
I'm "exhaustified" of being the boy.
The play is the thing, Amy!
You're too little to be Lady Violet.
Here, be the Countess de Montanescu.
- You don't have any lines.
- Besides who would be our Rodrigo?
Gentlemen...
I propose the admission of a new member to our theatrical society.
Theodore Laurence.
We'll put it to a vote.
Nay.
He'll laugh at our acting and poke fun at us later.
He'll think it's only a game.
No, he won't.
Upon my word as a gentleman.
Jo, when it's only ladies, we don't guard our conduct in the same way.
We bear our souls and tell the most appalling secrets.
- He would find us improper.
- Teddy would do nothing of the sort.
Oh, please?
Let's try him.
Shall we?
- Jo!
- Traitor!
Fellow artists, may I present myself... as an actor, a musician, and a loyal and very humble servant of the club.
We'll be the judge of that.
In token of my gratitude, and as a means of promoting... communication between adjoining nations... shouting from windows being forbidden, I shall provide... a post office in our hedge... to further encourage the baring of our souls... and the telling of our most appalling secrets.
I do pledge... never to reveal what I receive in confidence here.
Well then... do take your place, Rodrigo.
Sir...
Rodrigo.
And so Laurie was admitted as an equal into our society... and we March girls could enjoy the daily novelty... of having a real brother of our very own.
I want to go to the theater.
- I never get to go anywhere.
- You're too little.
Beth, where in tarnation are Marmee's opera glasses?
I'm not too little.
You're just hogging Laurie.
Please, can't I go?
Oh, Amy, I'm afraid Laurie only reserved four seats.
Do I look too shabby?
Oh, Jehoshaphat, Meg, this isn't a coronation.
It's just Laurie and that awful Mr. Brooke.
Jo, can't you ask Teddy to get another ticket?
No!
You have a cold, dear.
Rest your eyes.
Evangeline and I will make you some ginger tea.
You're weeks behind in algebra.
Do all the pages that I've marked.
I won't have a sister who's a lazy ignoramus.
- Don't sulk.
You look like a pigeon.
- Coo!
Coo!
Good night.
You'll be sorry for this, Jo March!
Whoa!
Whoa, there.
Thank you.
Oh, Mrs. Nell Watson.
Wasn't she a wonderful swooner?
If only I were the swooning type!
If only I were the catching type.
Young Laurence informs me... you are an aficionado of the theater, Miss March.
- Well, I-
- I enjoy reading plays.
- Yes.
I, I find it most pleasurable myself.
Though I confess I'm distracted at the theater... thinking of the peculiar lives of the actors themselves.
When one considers the immodesties Mrs. Nell Watson suffers... one wonders what sort of lady would seek such a life.
Meg is a sensational actress!
We're always putting on wild theatricals.
It's just something that we play at.
Well, as, as a matter of fact... at school I engaged in debating.
What do you think of that?
Let's see what they do.
- I had a wonderful time, Mr. Brooke.
- As did I.
It was a most delightful evening.
- And I'd very much like--
- Thank you very much.
Good night.
- Oh, good night.
- Good night.
- That was rude.
- You plastered yourself on him.
It's proper to take a gentleman's arm if it's offered.
How was the theater?
Amusing?
It was wonderful!
I was absolutely inspired by the love scene.
You look flushed, Meg dear.
Was the theater overcrowded?
Still sulking?
Beth, where did I put my manuscript?
Beth?
No!
Oh, no.
I didn't do it!
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!
Marmee, help me!
I'm gonna kill you!
Do you hear me?
- How can you do this to me?
- Jo!
- Jo, stop.
You're hurting her.
- Marmee!
- Marmee!
- Jo!
Jo!
Let go of her!
- What's happened?
All right, all right.
- I hate you!
No, Jo!
Don't touch it.
Come.
Just let it go.
You're dead!
You're nothing!
I never want to see you again!
It is a very great loss, and you have every right to be put out.
But don't let the sun go down upon your anger.
Forgive each other.
Begin again tomorrow, huh?
I will never forgive her.
I'm sorry, Jo.
Looks like the last ice we'll have this year.
Say "go."
Laurie, Jo, wait for me!
Ignore her.
Ready-
- Blast!
Jo, please!
- Amy!
- Jo!
Hold on.
I'm coming!
Hold on, Amy.
Get a rail!
Grab the stick, Amy.
- Grab it!
- Come on!
Hold on!
There we go.
That's it, that's it.
Josephine March, you walked all the way from Walden Pond...
- in only these bloomers?
- As if she even noticed.
Dear Amy.
How could I have been so horrible?
Thank God for Laurie.
Jo, do you love Laurie more than you love me?
Oh, don't be such a beetle!
I could never love anyone as I love my sisters.
I'm not a beetle.
Oh, look out.
You're leaving out the best part.
When Lady Zara succumbs to the Duke's rival.
Oh, right, yes!
Sir Hugo.
I quite prefer him myself.
In the spring, we turned Orchard House upside down... with preparations for Meg to attend Sally Moffat's coming out.
Myself, I'd sooner have been hung by the neck than attend a fancy ball.
Wait 'til all of Boston sees you in this dress, Meg.
I told Laurie he has to show you off and keep you from being a wallflower... upon penalty of death.
Oh, where is that miserable glove?
Abigail, I shake my head at the way you're managing Margaret.
How is she to be married without a proper debut?
Now, Auntie, in our present circumstances--
Your circumstances will not change with your husband's return.
My nephew is as foolish with money as he is in his new philosophies.
The one hope for your family is for Margaret to marry well... though I don't know who marries governesses.
Marmee!
And this one has entirely ruined her disposition with books.
Oh, are those for me, Josephine?
No.
Meg's taking them to the Moffat's.
Marmee, Meg's frantic.
She lost her glove, and she only has one pair.
She cannot go without gloves.
The Moffats are society.
You're absolutely correct.
Tell Meg she may borrow mine.
Meg, you can take Marmee's!
Oh, dear!
Ohh!
- More tea?
- No, thank you.
Sally Moffat, you won't be able to draw your laces.
At my coming out party, I didn't eat for weeks beforehand.
Oh, Meg, I do like that color on you.
It's just like forget-me-nots.
The nicest I've seen that kind of fabric since the war broke out.
But you had it made up so plain.
Well, I-- I do my own sewing, and--
Mrs. Finster's on Charles Street carries silk pieces ready-made.
- Tomorrow I'll take you there.
- Marches haven't bought silk in years.
They have views on slavery.
Meg, isn't it true your father's school had to close... when he admitted a little dark girl?
The silk of Mrs. Finster's isn't milled in the South.
It's made right here, over in Linfield.
This isn't China silk?
They use little children for labor.
All the silk mills do.
The poor are always with us.
You are so good to remind us.
May I tell you something?
This is an afternoon dress.
I'm going to make you my pet.
Tonight Miss March shall have as many conquests as she likes.
You have no corset.
Come on.
Not for me, thank you.
No, I believe the next dance is the polka... with me.
I would dance with you, Mr. Parker... but I fear for my new slippers.
My credo is, "Don't tread on me."
Miss March.
I thought your family were temperance people.
Laurie.
Oh, don't cover up.
There may be one or two gentlemen here... who haven't seen all of your charms.
I did promise Jo I would show you off.
The girls dressed me up, and I rather like it.
Yes, it reveals a whole new Meg.
What do you call this?
Meg!
I'm sorry.
Please don't tell Jo how I've behaved.
Of course not.
If you won't tell anyone how I've behaved.
I was only playing a part... to see how it felt to be Belle Gardiner... with four proposals and 20 pairs of gloves.
You're worth ten of those other girls.
Did you see the way this March girl has gone after the Laurence heir?
Best thing that could happen to the Marches.
Oh!
This ridiculous dress!
I've been tripping over it all night.
Tie something around your neck where it can do you some good.
I don't like people speculating about Laurie and our Meg... as if they were characters in some play.
Nothing provokes speculation more... than the sight of a woman enjoying herself.
Why is it Laurie may do as he likes, flirt and tipple champagne--
And no one thinks the less of him?
Well, I suppose for one practical reason:
Laurie is a man, and as such... he may vote, hold property and pursue any profession he pleases.
And so he is not so easily demeaned.
Why should anyone care what they think?
I do.
It's nice to be praised and admired.
I couldn't help but like it.
Of course not!
I only care what you think of yourself.
If you feel your value lies in being merely decorative...
I fear that someday you might find yourself... believing that's all that you really are.
Time erodes all such beauty, but what it cannot diminish... is the wonderful workings of your mind.
Your humor, your kindness... and your moral courage.
These are the things I cherish so in you.
I so wish I could give my girls a more just world.
I know you'll make it a better place.
Hmm?
"...resounded, resounded with song of the nightingale."
No.
No, I don't want them now.
And keep the music.
I won't be going near a piano for ages.
You need your books in college.
Here's your Dombey and Sons.
I could've sworn there was another volume.
Honestly, Jo...
I won't be taking all of Dickens to Harvard with me.
Oh, no.
You'll have much more important things to read.
Nothing's going to change, Jo.
I wish I could go.
I wish you could too.
You'll come back knowing all sorts of things I don't know... and then I'll hate you.
Oh.
Well, as it happens...
I already know something you don't know.
About Meg and a certain former tutor of mine... soon to be employed at the firm of Laurence and Laurence.
Liar.
Has Meg mislaid a certain personal article... such as a glove?
Meg, John Brooke stole your glove!
What glove?
N-Not my white one?
Brooke's had it forever.
Laurie says he keeps it in his pocket.
You must tell him to return it.
Hannah, don't you think he oughta give it back?
'Tisn't what I think that matters.
Jo?
Meg?
It's, uh, a telegram... from Washington Hospital.
Your father's been wounded.
- Come on, Amy.
That's it.
- There are six.
The household account is in this ledger.
It should see you through the month.
- Of course.
Don't worry about us.
- Oh, Beth?
Look in on the Hummels for me, will you?
I will, Marmee.
Where's Jo?
It's almost 6:00.
Doing battle with Aunt March for Marmee's railway ticket.
Carry a letter to Mrs. Juba at the Hope House.
John!
Mr. Brooke.
I've come to offer myself as an escort to your mother.
Cook packed this up... and Grandfather sends a bottle of spirits for Mr. March.
- That's lovely.
Thank you.
- Marmee?
- Mr. Brooke is here.
- Mrs. March.
Mr. Brooke.
As young Laurence no longer requires a tutor...
Mr. Laurence has commissions for me in Washington.
I should like to be of service to you there.
- We couldn't let you travel alone.
- Mr. Brooke, how kind of you.
- May I?
- Thank you.
Are we to go on the 6:00 train?
Yes, I sent Jo off, but she hasn't--
- I'm here!
- Jo.
Finally.
Twenty-five.
Can Aunt March spare this?
I couldn't bear to ask her.
- I sold my hair.
- Jo, how could you?
Your one beauty.
It isn't going to affect the state of the Union.
- It'll grow back.
- It suits you.
Tell Father that we love him.
- Tell him we pray for him.
- Bring him home.
- I'll never forget his kindness.
- Hannah, thank you.
Oh, I shall miss my little women.
Are you thinking about Father?
No.
My hair.
- A little harder.
- Yeah, I hit him on the noggin.
Wait for me!
Blast!
Oh, dear.
- This stove!
- We'll eat them anyway.
There's no more cornmeal nor coffee.
The grocer won't let us have more on account.
- What can I bring the Hummels?
- Oh, fry the Hummels!
- You spent hours there last week.
- The boys are sick.
I mustn't write of this to Marmee.
- She has enough burdens now.
- I hate money!
Your potatoes!
Come on!
Here!
Air the beds.
And be careful cleaning.
- And don't forget your studies, Amy.
- I won't.
I will.
Go!
- Beth!
- Christine.
I don't understand.
I brought you a potato.
- Laurie's home for the weekend!
- In need of funds, no doubt.
We'd have a week's groceries with what he spends on billiards.
Oh, Jehoshaphat!
Meg!
Meg, you won't believe it!
I've sold the Lost Duke of Gloucester!
Five whole dollars!
I'm an author!
- Beth?
- The Hummel baby is sick.
I feel so strange.
She's burning up, but she says that she's freezing.
She has a terrible thirst, but she won't drink.
Sounds like arsenicum, but she looks more like belladonna.
I saw the Hummels.
Two children taken up to Jesus.
Scarlet fever.
You and Miss Jo won't be harmed.
You had it when you were babies.
But, Miss Amy, we have to send you away.
She won't die.
Will she, Laurie?
God wouldn't let her die.
I don't wanna go away.
I'll come and see you every day.
I swear it.
You won't be alone.
I'm afraid of Aunt March.
If she's unkind to you...
I'll come and take you away.
Where will we go?
Paris?
If I get scarlet fever and die... give Meg my box with the green doves on it.
- And Jo must have my turquoise ring.
- I'll see to that.
I don't wanna die.
I've never even been kissed.
I've waited my whole life to be kissed.
And what if I miss it?
I tell you what.
I promise to kiss you before you die.
Whoa!
I don't know.
I don't think Marmee should leave Father.
Beth needs Marmee.
She depends on her.
But what if we send for her and Father gets worse?
How in the name of all that's holy would we pay for the train?
"That he profane not my 'sancteraries'--"
- Sanctuary.
- "Sanctuaries.
For I, the Lord, do sanctify them.
And Moses told it unto Aaron and to his sons... and unto all the children of Israel."
Go on.
"And the Lord spake unto Moses saying--"
Jo, Mr. Laurence is here.
If we may, I wish my personal physician, Dr. Bangs... to examine the little girl.
There's nothing to be done.
If I bleed her, it would finish her.
- Best to send for the mother.
- Forgive me.
I've already done so.
Mrs. March arrives on the train this night.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women and--
Cricket, Marmee's here.
Icy cold.
Jo.
Jo, fetch a basin with vinegar water and rags.
Meg, my kit.
Must draw the fever down from her head.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right now.
That's my love.
Beth!
And so our dear Beth came back to us... although the fever had weakened her heart forever.
We did not know then that a shadow had fallen.
We prepared for another Christmas without Father.
Try each corner.
Thank you.
No, no!
One bow is enough!
Mr. Laurence.
Thank you.
- Oh.
I'm so sorry.
- It happens all the time.
Here she comes!
- Come on!
Come on!
- What should I do with these bows?
Now, don't scare her to death.
She's been sick, you know.
Hide the chairs.
Hide them, Amy!
Quick.
The house is beautiful.
They're friends of mine from college.
Freddy Vaughan and Averill Watson.
They won't bite.
No, don't sit there!
Sit--
Here.
Sit here child.
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Beth!
- Merry Christmas, Beth!
I should have given it to you long ago.
It belonged to my little girl... who had to leave us when she was very young.
But now, it will make music again.
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.
Play something, Beth.
Shall I?
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la La la la la
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la La la la la
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa la la la la la La la la
Troll the ancient yuletide carol
Fa la la la la La la la la
See the blazing yule before us
Fa la la la la La la la la
Strike the harp and join the chorus
Fa la la la la La la la la
Follow me in merry measure
Fa la la la la la La la la
While I tell of yuletide treasure
Fa la la la la La la la la
That was good.
I fear you would have a long engagement.
Three or four years.
John must secure a house before you can marry... and he must do a service to the Union.
John?
Marry?
You mean that pokey old Mr. Brooke?
How did he weasel his way into this family?
John has been very kind to go visit father in the hospital every day.
He's dull as powder.
Meg, can't you at least marry someone amusing?
I'm fond of Mr. Brooke.
He's a good man.
He's kind and serious... and I'm not afraid of being poor.
Marmee, you can't just let her go and marry him.
I'd hardly just go and marry anyone.
I would rather Meg marry for love and be a poor man's wife... than marry for riches and lose her self-respect.
So you don't mind that John is poor?
No, but I would rather he have a house.
Why must we marry at all?
Why can't things just stay as they are?
It is only a proposal.
Nothing need be decided.
Now, girls... let's not spoil the day.
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn king
Glory to the newborn king
Peace on earth
- Father?
- And mercy mild
- Father!
- Merry Christmas, everyone.
What a wonderful Christmas present!
Oh, Father, you're home!
Oh, you're more handsome than ever!
Beth, my little cookie.
Thank God you're well.
Give the man room to breathe.
Jo!
Oh, my wild girl!
Well, this could become the fashion.
- Watch his arm.
Be careful.
- I'm not used to this.
Be very careful now.
Don't coddle this soldier too much.
Oh, Father!
Hannah, God bless you.
It's good to see you.
It's good to have you home, Mr. March.
Now, let me look at my girls.
Take them and give them--
The cholera took more men than the rebs, as I understand it, sir.
Agriculture isn't taught, and it should be.
It should be required.
Perhaps the freedmen should be given land in the West.
- What happened between you and John?
- Never you mind.
Isn't it wonderful, Jo?
Yes, it's wonderful.
Welcome home, soldier.
Would you like some water, sir?
From our birth
Over and around us lies
Lord of all to Thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise
Change will come as surely as the seasons and twice as quick.
We make our peace with it as best we can... or as Amy once said when she was still a little girl:
"We'll all grow up someday.
We might as well know what we want."
Sun and moon and stars of light
Lord of all to Thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise
Lord of all to Thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise
So you feel our Amy has talent?
Oh, Miss March excels at drawing... but, you know, her landscapes lack emotion.
I definitely feel Amy would benefit from further study... but she won't get it around here.
Where do you suggest?
Cape Cod has a fine artist colony... but Europe is the best place.
Your houseman said you wouldn't be home till night.
- I couldn't wait so long.
- Hail the conquering graduate!
Is Grandfather exceedingly proud?
Yes, and exceedingly bent on locking me up in one of his offices.
Why is it Amy may paint china and you can scribble away... while I must manfully set my music aside?
Why must you?
If I don't...
I'd have to defy Grandfather.
Yes, and not the whole of society.
I can't go against the old man.
When I imagine myself in that life...
I can think of only one thing... that would make me happy.
Oh, no, Teddy.
Teddy, don't.
No, wait, Teddy.
We have to talk about this reasonably.
I have loved you... since the moment I clamped eyes on you.
Would could be more reasonable than to marry you?
- We'd kill each other.
- Nonsense.
- Neither of us can keep our temper.
- I can... unless provoked.
We're both stupidly stubborn, especially you.
- We'd only quarrel.
- I wouldn't!
You can't even propose without quarreling.
Dear Jo, I swear I'll be a saint.
I'll let you win every argument.
I'll take care of you and your family.
I'll give you every luxury you've ever been denied.
You won't have to write unless you want to.
Grandfather... wants me to learn the business in England.
Can't you see us bashing around London?
London.
Oh, Teddy, I'm not fashionable enough for London.
You need someone who's elegant and refined.
I want you.
Teddy, please, don't ask me.
- Teddy, I'm desperately sorry.
- No.
- I do care for you...
- No.
with all of my heart.
You're my dearest friend.
I just can't go be a wife.
You say you won't, but... you will.
I won't.
One day... you'll meet some man.
A good man.
And you will love him tremendously.
And you will live and die for him.
- Teddy, please.
- You will.
I know you.
And I'll be hanged... if I stand by and watch.
Jo, are you ill?
She has refused Laurie.
Well, I'm sure she can take it back.
It's just a misunderstanding.
Listen to him.
I must get away.
Of course.
Aunt March is going to France.
France!
That's ideal!
I'll put up with anything to go!
Aunt March has asked me to go.
To Europe?
My Europe?
When?
It was decided just today.
Well, I am her companion now.
She wishes me to study painting abroad... in hopes I might make a good match there.
But perhaps she wouldn't mind if you stayed at Plumfield... while we are gone.
Of course Aunt March prefers Amy over me.
Why shouldn't she?
I'm ugly and awkward, and I always say the wrong things.
I fly around throwing away perfectly good marriage proposals.
I love our home, but I'm just so fitful that I can't stand being here!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Marmee.
There's just something really wrong with me.
I want to change, but I can't... and I just know I'll never fit in anywhere.
Jo, you have so many extraordinary gifts.
How can you expect to lead an ordinary life?
You're ready to go out and find a good use for your talent.
Although I don't know what I shall do without my Jo.
Go... and embrace your liberty... and see what wonderful things come of it.
Laurie sought his refuge in London and abroad.
Marmee helped me find a place in the great city of New York... and so I stepped over the divide between childhood and all that lay beyond.
Mrs. Kirk?
Josephine!
- Yes.
How do you do?
- Kitty, Minnie.
This is Miss March.
Her father was Colonel March.
He knew your papa.
- It was cold.
- Watch your feet, Mr. Costigan.
- Do come in, my dear.
- You're making that up.
Dear Beth:
Marmee's friend, Mrs. Kirk, has made me feel quite at home.
My little students, Kitty and Minnie, are dear girls.
How curious to grow up in a busy boarding house... with no father and your own mother the innkeeper.
I felt bold on leaving Concord... but I confess I find New York rough and strange... and myself strange in it.
Please pass these down the table.
Thank you kindly, Professor.
Mrs. Kirk believes that I am here... for a brief interlude of sensational experience... before succumbing to a matrimonial fate.
Excuse me, miss.
And while there is surely no lack of sensational experience... of every kind available in such a city...
- Come in!
- I hope, though I've had no luck yet... that any experience I gain here will be strictly literary... and that all events of a romantic or sensational nature... will be entirely confined to the page.
Our subscribers are not interested in sentiment and fairy stories, miss.
They're not fairy stories.
Try one of the ladies' magazines.
- Come on, Will!
Hurry up!
- I'm coming!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so clumsy.
You know that when first I saw you, I thought...
"Ah!
She is a writer."
What made you think so?
Yes, I know many writers.
In Berlin I was professor at the university.
Here I am just a humble tutor, I'm afraid.
Please, sit down.
Thank you.
You are far from home, Miss March?
- Do you miss your family?
- Oh, very much.
My sisters especially.
And Laurie.
She is your sister?
No, he's a friend.
You like your coffee?
Oh, it's... just very strong.
I like it.
You have quite a library.
Did you bring all these books from Germany?
A few of them.
- May I?
- Of course.
Most of these I could not bear to leave behind.
I sold everything that I own to get my passage to come here... but my books... never.
Shakespeare.
Some books are so familiar.
Reading them is like being home again.
Will you be returning to Berlin, Professor Bhaer?
Friedrich.
Call me Friedrich.
Friedrich.
No.
Sadly, the fatherland of Goethe and Schiller... is no more.
I adore Goethe.
My father used to read me all the German poets when I was a child.
Really?
That is most surprising.
My mother and father were part of... a rather unusual circle in Concord.
Do you know the word "transcendentalist"?
But this is German romantic philosophy.
We throw off all our constraints and we come to know ourselves... through insight and experience.
It got out of fashion now.
Not in the March family, I'm afraid.
It's just that with all of this transcendence... comes much emphasis on perfecting oneself.
This gives you a problem?
I'm hopelessly flawed.
If only we could... transcend ourselves without perfection.
Like your poet, Walt Whitman... who rides up and down the streets of Broadway all day... shouting poetry against the roar of the carts.
"Keep your silent woods, O Nature...
- "And your quiet places by the river--
- And your quiet places by the woods... by the woods.
Give me the streets of Manhattan."
I think we are all hopelessly flawed.
He is as poor as one might imagine an itinerant philosopher to be.
Yet, as the weeks go by, I see that he is unfailingly generous... to all of us who live in the house.
I am grateful to have a friend.
It is the system our nation was founded on.
Come now.
It was nothing short of a betrayal of our country's ideals.
Our country's ideals?
A constitution... that denies the basic rights of citizenship to women and black people?
They just passed the 15th Amendment, Jacob.
- They can vote.
- Black men can vote, Charles.
A lady has no need of suffrage if she has a husband.
- You don't take wine?
- Only medicinally.
Pretend that you've got a cold.
I agree, but if women are a moral force... shouldn't they have the right to govern and preach and testify in court?
What is it, Miss March?
I find it poor logic to say that because women are good... women should vote.
Men do not vote because they are good.
They vote because they are male.
And women should vote not because they are angels and men are animals... but because we are human beings and citizens of this country.
You should have been a lawyer, Miss March.
I should have been a great many things, Mr. Mayer.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, please.
Please, come in.
I have some good news.
A newspaper has published two of my stories, and they wish to see more.
This is wonderful.
Right there.
- The Daily Volcano?
- Yes.
"The Sinner's Corpse"... by Joseph March.
Lunatics.
Vampires.
This interests you?
People like thrilling stories, Friedrich.
This is what the newspapers want.
Yes.
Yes, I suppose.
I suppose that is true.
It will buy a new coat for Beth, and I'm sure she'll be grateful to have it.
I do not want to be your teacher.
No, understand me.
I am saying only that you should please yourself.
My opinion is of no importance.
Do you forgive me?
- Of course.
- Then I make a gift.
An experience.
Do you like the opera?
Oh, I do.
I mean, I think I do.
We don't seem to get a lot of opera in Concord.
I don't have an opera dress.
You will be perfect.
Where we are sitting, we shall not be so... formal.
Leila is a goddess.
She has made a promise never to love.
If she breaks her vow, all will be lost.
Oh, look.
Trouble is coming.
- What's going to happen?
- The inevitable.
Leila's soul is opening.
She's drawn to an idea.
He says, "Love has a fatal power."
Your heart... understood mine.
In the depth of the fragrant night...
I listened with ravished soul... to your beloved voice.
Your heart understood mine.
Oh, Laurie!
You wicked!
We heard you were in Greece or somewhere.
Laurie!
Come!
Come!
You've been much occupied with business, I am sure.
I'm not pursuing business just now.
Grandfather agreed I should concentrate... on my music for a while.
You know Fred Vaughan?
- Freddy.
- Good day, Laurence.
Yes.
I see you've taken up a passion for art, Freddy.
Aunt March, you look splendid.
I cannot say the same for you, my boy.
Amy dear.
- Will you be long?
I must retire.
- Yes, Aunt March.
Do come see us.
- Are they engaged?
- Not yet.
Hop, hop.
One, two, three, four.
Hop, hop, hop, turn.
Friedrich, how long would it take strychnine to dissolve in brandy?
Oh.
About eight minutes?
And is a dagger worn at the waist, or is that a saber?
I think that in these novels... the dagger is usually concealed in the boot... by a man with a dark moustache.
Go this way.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Oh, Laurie, how lovely.
It isn't what it should be, but you have improved it.
Please don't.
I liked you much better when you were blunt and natural.
It did not serve me well.
I find you changed.
In fact, I despise you.
You laze about spending your family's money and courting women.
You aren't serious about music.
My compositions are like your paintings:
mediocre copies of another man's genius.
Then why don't you go to Grandfather in London and make yourself useful?
I should.
Why don't you reform me?
I've someone more practical in mind.
You do not love Fred Vaughan.
Fred Vaughan is stable and well-mannered--
And has 40,000 a year.
I've always known I would not marry a pauper.
I expect a proposal any day.
You'll regret it.
I'll regret it.
I'm reminded of a promise.
Didn't I say I would kiss you before you die?
Do you hear from Jo?
She has befriended a German professor.
Yes.
No doubt he's showing her... the ways of the world.
I do not wish to be courted by someone who is still in love with my sister!
I'm not in love with Jo.
Then how do you explain your jealousy?
I envy her happiness.
I envy his happiness.
I envy John Brooke for marrying Meg.
I hate Fred Vaughan.
If Beth had a lover, I would despise him too.
Just as you have always known you would never marry a pauper...
I have always known...
I should be part of the March family.
I do not wish to be loved for my family.
Any more than Fred Vaughan wishes to be loved for his 40,000 a year.
My darling Amy.
It is you I want and not your family.
I've gone to London to make myself worthy of you.
Please, do not do anything we shall regret.
Monsieur Vaughan, mademoiselle.
May I show him in?
- Friedrich, did you read it?
- Yes.
It's well written, Jo.
And the first novel.
What a great accomplishment.
I'm going to be showing it to your publisher friend, Mr. Fields, today.
He liked "The Sinner's Corpse."
What is it?
Mr. Fields is a good man.
He will give you an honest opinion.
Oh, I see.
What is your honest opinion?
- I'm a professor of philosophy.
- No, I'd like to know what you think.
You should be writing from life... from the depths of your soul.
There is nothing in here of the woman that I am privileged to know.
Friedrich, this is what I write.
My apologies if it fails to live up to your high standards.
Jo, there is more to you than this... if you have the courage to write it.
Why didn't you tell me?
One hardly speaks of such things.
Oh, how wonderful.
How is Beth?
You will find her much altered.
Marmee.
She wouldn't let us send for you sooner.
The doctor has been here a number of times... but it's beyond all of us, and I think--
I think she's been waiting for you... before--
You're going to drink up all of this good broth.
I'm glad you're home.
So am I.
"Mr. Pickwick changed color.
'Ah,' said Mr. Wartle.
'Well, that's important.
There's nothing suspicious then, I suppose."'
I feel stronger with you close by.
I'm going to get you better yet.
If God wants me with Him, there is none who will stop Him.
I don't mind.
I was never like the rest of you... making plans about the great things I'd do.
I never saw myself as anything much.
Not a great writer like you.
Beth, I'm not a great writer.
But you will be.
Oh, Jo, I've missed you so.
Why does everyone want to go away?
I love being home.
But I don't like being left behind.
Now I am the one going ahead.
I am not afraid.
I can be brave like you.
But I know I shall be homesick for you... even in heaven.
I won't let you go.
Oh, my Jo.
Aunt March is bedridden and would not survive a sea voyage.
Amy must bide her time and return later.
It's just as well.
Will we never all be together again?
Lovely morning.
Thank you, sir.
Dearest Laurie:
You may not have heard our sad news of Beth's--
"Meg has entered her confinement... and poor Amy must stay in Vevey with Aunt March."
This is far too great a sorrow to bear alone.
Please come home to us, Teddy dear.
Your faithful, Jo.
I knew you would come.
The real charm of it lay in Beth's happy face... as she leaned over the new piano and lovingly touched... the beautiful black and white keys.
During the next few minutes, the rumor circulated... that Amy March had got 24 delicious limes.
I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you... that they powdered and squeezed and made me look a fashion plate.
As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet.
A general outcry arose, for all her abundant hair was cut short.
Jo, how could you?
Your one beauty.
Nothing's going to change, Jo.
For the beauty of the earth
For the glory of the skies
For the love which from our birth
Over and around us lies
Lord of all to Thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise
Surprise!
John, you have a daughter.
And a son.
Oh, Marmee, I can't believe you did this four times.
Yes, but never two at once, my darling.
Oh, Daisy.
Oh, Meg, she's so beautiful.
And him.
He is handsome.
He's going to look just like his papa when he grows up.
Yes, he does look like John.
Have you heard from the professor?
We did not part well.
John and I don't always agree, but then we mend it.
Who could that be?
Oh, this is magic!
You are absolutely--
Covered in flour!
Oh, dear!
- Come in.
- No, Jo, not yet.
May I tell you something without the others?
You're my dear friend.
I'm glad that you shall be the first to know.
- What?
- May I present... my wife.
Oh, my!
- Here, flowers.
- Thank you.
Come in!
Brussels lace!
Oh!
I went to Europe to paint the great cathedrals... but I couldn't get our home out of my mind.
Oh, look how Amy has captured Orchard House.
- Lovely.
- Oh, it's beautiful.
Not as beautiful as I wanted, but I am still learning.
Dear little angel.
Jo, you must tell me the truth, as a sister... which is a relation stronger than marriage.
Do you mind at all?
Oh, no.
I was surprised.
Mind you, I had it on good authority that our Teddy... would never love another.
And now he's gone and gotten married.
It's good to hear you call me Teddy again.
At last, we're all family, as we always should have been.
You must promise me that you will always live close by.
I couldn't bear losing another sister.
Jo, it's so gloomy and chilly.
One would require an income just for the coal to heat this place.
What could the dear old girl have been thinking?
Most likely she felt sorry for me.
Decrepit homeless spinster!
Oh, poor Aunt.
Living here all those years alone in this useless old house.
Yes, her blessings became a burden because she couldn't share them.
Wouldn't this have made a wonderful school?
A school.
What a challenge that would be.
Hello, Tuppy.
Hello.
Good boy.
My book!
Someone's publishing my book.
- Someone's publishing my book!
- Heaven help us!
It came with no letter.
How did it arrive?
Foreign gentleman brung it.
Strange kind of name.
Can't think of it.
Oh, Fox, or Bear or such.
Bhaer!
Did you ask him to wait?
I thought he was one of Miss Amy's European friends... coming with a wedding gift.
I said, "Miss March and Mr. Laurie are living next door."
- Hannah, you didn't!
- Then he said he had a train to catch.
Friedrich!
Oh, Friedrich, thank you for my book.
When I didn't hear from you...
I thought you hated it.
Oh, no.
Reading your book was like opening a window... into your heart.
James Fields took it out of my hands, and he would not give it back to me.
I said, "Such news I have to give to her myself."
Well, it was a silly impulse.
No, not silly at all.
It's so good to see you.
- Come and meet my family.
- No, I--
Thank you, but...
I have to catch a train.
I am going to the West.
My ship leaves from Boston tomorrow morning.
Yes, the schools in the West are young.
They need professors and... they are not so concerned about the accent.
I don't mind it either.
See, my aunt left me Plumfield.
It isn't a field.
It's a house, actually.
A rather large house.
And it isn't really good for anything except a school... and I want a good school... one that would be open to anyone who wanted to learn, and, well...
I'll be needing someone who knows how to teach.
Is there nothing I might say to keep you here?
I confess that I was hoping that I might have a reason... to stay, but... congratulations on the celebration of your marriage.
Oh, no!
No, that's Amy.
That's my sister.
Amy and Laurie, actually.
No, I'm not married.
Please don't go so far away.
Jo.
Such a little name for-- for such a person.
Will you have me?
With all of my heart!
But I have nothing to give you.
My hands are empty.
Not empty now.
- Is this too fast?
- Harder!
My sisters and I remember that winter... as the coldest of our childhood.
A temporary poverty had settled upon our family some years before.
The war had made fuel and lamp oil scarce.
But necessity is indeed the mother of invention.
Somehow in that dark time... our family, the March family, seemed to create its own light.
Marmee!
Marmee's home!
Marmee!
Marmee!
We waited and waited!
We've been "expectorating" you for hours!
- Have you, my darling?
- " Expecting," featherhead.
- Oh, Marmee, you're frozen!
- Yes.
If you could see the people lined up outside Hope House in this bitter cold.
- Mmm, your cheeks are so warm.
- Finished your Christmas bundles?
So many this year!
We were handing out--
- Oh, how is your cold?
- Better.
Good.
We were handing out food... as quickly as we could make up the baskets.
Now, Miss Amy, what is this in my pocket?
Father!
" My dearest family, I am well and safe.
Our battalion is encamped on the 'Potamac'."
- Potomac.
- Potomac.
" December makes a hard, cold season for all of us so far from home.
I think of my girls day and night... and find my best comfort in your affection.
I pray that your own hardships will not be too great to bear.
Give them all my dear love and a kiss.
Tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night."
- Poor Father.
- I'm a selfish girl.
Oh!
Little ones.
It's Christmas Eve.
Father wouldn't want us to be sad now.
Ding-dong merrily on high
In heaven the bells are ringing
In heaven the bells are ringing
Ding-dong merrily the sky is riven with angels singing
Glor-o-o-ria
Hosanna in excelsis
To bed, Miss Amy.
- Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
- Merry Christmas.
Let steeple bells be swungen
And i-o i-o i-o
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Glor-o-o-ria
Merry Christmas, Beth.
- Love you.
- I love you.
Hosanna in excelsis
My Jo.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Marmee.
Hosanna in excelsis
And don't sit up too late.
I won't.
May you beautifully rhyme your eve-time song ye singers
Late at night, my mind would come alive with voices and stories... and friends as dear to me as any in the real world.
I gave myself up to it, longing for transformation.
Oh, what miraculous food!
Isn't this just like the old days, Hannah?
Oh.
We shouldn't eat it.
We should just look at it.
I'm going to eat it.
Jo?
Jo, come down!
I'm awake!
Horrible piano.
Hannah's put together an absolute Christmas miracle.
Is that sausage?
Wait!
Oh, butter!
Oh, oh, isn't butter "divinity"?
Oh, God, thank you for this breakfast.
Jo, angel, fetch your Marmee.
She went out at the crack of dawn to see some Germans.
Hummel, the boy said.
Not a word of English.
His da's gone.
Six children, and she's 'bout to issue another.
May as well take 'em a stick of firewood.
Sure they haven't got any.
Or breakfast either.
Perhaps we could send the Hummels our bread.
Might as well send the butter too.
Butter's not much use... without bread to put it on.
Oh, wonderful snow!
Don't you wish you could roll about in it like dogs?
Once one of our finest families.
Lovely weather for a picnic!
Come along, Theodore.
We'll be late for church.
Jo, you should let them speak first.
What will they think of us?
Oh, don't look back!
Here we come a-wassailing among the leaves so green
And here we come a-wandering so fair as to be seen
Love and joy come to you And to you your wassail too
And God bless you and send you a happy new year
And God send you a happy new year
"Knights and ladies, elves and pages, monks and flower girls... all mingled gaily in the dance.
Pauline cried out in horror as her bridegroom's mask fell... disclosing not her lover Ferdinand... but the face of his sworn enemy, Count Antonio.
Revenge is mine, quoth he."
Continued in the following edition.
Excellent installment, Mr. Snodgrass.
- Oh, I love forbidden marriages!
- You ought to publish it, Jo.
Really!
Not just in the Pickwick Portfolio.
Mr. Tupman, are you demeaning our fine newspaper?
Mr. Winkle.
"One periwink--" Advertisement.
"One periwinkle sash belonging to Mr. N. Winkle... has been 'abscondated' from the wash line... which gentleman desires any reports leading to its recovery."
Gentlemen of the press, hear, hear!
I call to your attention... our Mr. Tupman's The History of the Squash.
Oh, don't read mine.
Beth, this isn't a story.
It's a recipe.
Oh, dear, I never know what to write.
First rule of writing, Mr. Tupman, is never write what you know.
What do we think of the boy?
Is he a captive like Smee in Nicholas Nickleby?
He looks lonely.
You don't think he'll try to call?
Maybe he has a secret-- a tragic, European secret.
He's had no upbringing at all they say.
He was reared in Italy among artists and vagrants.
Doesn't he have a noble brow?
If I were a boy, I'd want to look just like that.
Imagine giving up Italy to come live with that awful old man!
Jo, please don't say awful.
It's slang.
I'd be terrified to live with him.
I shouldn't mind living in such a fine house and having nice things.
Oh, it doesn't seen like Christmas this year without presents.
I'm desperate for drawing pencils.
I wish I didn't have to work for Great-Aunt March... that crabby old miser.
And you, Beth.
What's your Christmas wish?
I'd like the war to end so Father can come home.
Oh, sweet Beth.
We all want that.
They do have a beautiful piano.
Wait 'til I'm a writer.
I'll buy you the best piano in creation.
And if she doesn't, you can come over and play mine.
When I marry, I'm going to be disgustingly rich.
And what if the man you love is a poor man but good, like Father?
Well, it isn't like being stuck with the dreadful nose you get.
One does have a choice to whom one loves.
You have a lovely nose!
I wouldn't marry for the money.
I mean, what if his business goes bust?
Besides, down at the Eagle, they pay $5 for each story they print.
Why, I have ten stories in my head right now!
Gentlemen, I dislike all this money talk.
It isn't refined.
If lack of attention to personal finances is a mark of refinement... then I'd say the Marches are the most elegant family in Concord.
We'll all grow up someday, Meg.
We might as well know what we want.
That'll do.
Put the carriage away, and look smart about it.
Very good, sir.
Merry Christmas!
I have the most wonderful feeling about tonight.
Meg and Jo, you have to tell me...
"exquisitely" everything about Belle Gardiner.
What her nose looks like and about her ring.
Annie Gardiner says it's an emerald.
Can you imagine?
Everyone's lucky but me.
I'm glad I don't have to go and be with those frightening people... and try to think of things to say.
- Hush now.
- Oh, mind you, Jo... don't eat much at supper... and don't shake hands with people.
It isn't the thing anymore.
- Jo, your dress!
- Oh, I know!
You always stand too close to the fire.
Oh, dear.
Well, just keep your backside to the wall.
- Meg, look.
What cunning little heels.
- They're rather small.
That's all right.
It's only for one night.
You don't suppose anyone will notice... they came out of the rag bag, do you?
Uh-uh.
You have to have heels.
What's that strange smell?
Like burnt feathers.
- Heavens above!
- You've ruined me!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have had me do it!
- Meg, don't worry.
- I spoil everything.
- I can't go out like this!
- Good!
I'm not going either.
Here, we'll place my bow in front.
- Yes, that covers it.
- It's very becoming.
I'll never have any suitors.
I'll just be a dried-up old spinster.
You don't need scores of suitors.
You only need one, if he's the right one.
Listen to the child.
Meg isn't going to be married right away, is she?
With Jo's help, I never will.
- You must be so happy.
- Oh, Belle, it's enchanting.
Well, I best go help Mama.
Excuse me.
I think it's Mrs. Barkley.
She's going to try it.
Watch her.
Oh, yes, I would like it very much.
Jehoshaphat!
I'm sorry.
No, no, stay!
It's not a bad hiding place.
You see, I don't know anyone... so I feel awkward standing and staring at people.
Should I put on my jacket?
I never know the rules.
Um, um, I'm Laurie.
Theodore Laurence, but I'm, uh, I'm called Laurie.
Jo March.
Um--
So, who were you staring at?
Uh, you, actually.
What-- what game were you playing?
I don't know, but I think I won.
- Who else?
- Well, I was--
I was quite taken with that one.
That's Meg.
That's my sister.
She's completely bald in front.
Is it true that you lived in Italy among artists and vagrants?
My mother was Italian.
A, uh, pianist.
- Grandfather disapproved of her.
- Truly?
I saw a play like that once.
Do you like the theater?
- Oh, yes.
- Were you born there?
Where?
In-- In, uh, Italy.
- Do you speak French or Italian?
- English at home.
Francais a L 'ecole.
The Music Conservatory in Vevey.
But Grandfather's having me tutored now.
He insists I go to college.
Oh, I'd commit murder to go to college.
Ohh!
Actually, I'm going to Europe.
Well, at least I hope I am.
My Great-Aunt March says she'll go one of these days... and she has to take me with her because I work as her companion.
I have to read to her for hours and hours.
- But I do all the voices!
- I'll bet you do.
If I weren't going to be a writer...
I'd go to New York and pursue the stage.
- Are you shocked?
- Very.
I-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Meg always makes me take the gentleman's part at home.
It's a shame you don't know the lady's part.
Why are you looking at the back of my dress?
It isn't so bad!
Honestly.
You promised you wouldn't look.
Oh, Jo, I've sprained my ankle.
I shouldn't wonder in those shoes!
Does it hurt?
Oh.
Oh, no, no.
I'm quite well, thank you.
Well, this is our neighbor, Laurie, the captive.
Oh, poor Meg.
I'll go tell Mrs. Gardiner.
Oh, no, Jo.
She'll think I've been sampling the punch.
- A perfectly good party ruined.
- I have my carriage.
Let me take you home.
- Oh, yes!
- Oh, no, thank you.
Thank you.
Lean on me.
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.
That's very kind of you.
- Good-bye, Laurie.
- Good night, Mrs. March.
Wherever did you get this shoe?
Did you ride in his carriage?
Oh, you two have all the luck.
- Oh, Jo, is he very romantic?
- Not in the slightest!
We're very much obliged to him, but he's a dreadful boy.
He did a good deed putting snow on this ankle.
- He put snow on your ankle?
- To bed, Miss Amy.
- With his own hands?
- Oh, stop being so swoony.
I won't have my girls being silly about boys.
To bed, Jo, dear.
Does this hurt?
- Everything lovely happens to Meg.
- Oh, yes indeed!
You mustn't be soppy about Laurie anymore than you should be soppy... about those silly girls at school.
I hope we shall be good friends with him.
- With a boy?
- He isn't a boy!
He's Laurie!
Faster!
Faster!
Laurie!
Your young ladies are unusually active, Mrs. March, if I may say so.
You may indeed, Mr. Brooke.
It is my opinion that young girls are no different than boys... in their need for exertion.
Feminine weakness and fainting spells are the direct result... of our confining young girls to the house... bent over their needlework in restrictive corsets.
Marmee!
Your young student is an athlete.
He is, thank you, a good one.
But he makes an unruly scholar.
I regret that his grandfather is away much.
One hopes that your girls... will be a gentling influence.
Indeed, Mr. Brooke.
Marmee, must you speak to everyone about corsets?
Oh, Meg.
Do I?
Blast these wretched skirts!
Don't say blast and wretch.
Amy, don't be such a ninny-pinny.
I wish I was Beth so I could stay home and do pleasant things.
Oh, if you call doing laundry and housework pleasant!
Blast!
Amy, hurry.
I'll be late for work.
There's Mrs. King.
I'm tardy again.
Lovely children.
Oh, Meg, must I go to school?
I'm so "degradatated."
I can hardly hold my head up.
I owe at least a dozen limes.
- Limes?
- Are limes the fashion now?
Of course they are.
It's nothing but limes now.
Everyone keeps them in their desks and trades them for beads and things.
And all the girls treat each other at recess.
If you don't bring limes to school, you're nothing.
You might as well be dead.
I've had ever so many limes, and I can't pay anyone back.
No wonder you don't learn anything at that school!
I know how it feels to do without any little luxuries.
But we are not destitute, not yet.
Here's a quarter.
Marmee gave me the rag money this month.
Go on!
"Secondly, the immortality of the soul... is asserted to be in consequence... of its immateriality... as in all leipothymic cases... consistent with the idea of immortality... and immorality, and physicality--"
And I think you finally dozed off.
Josephine, there's a draft!
Is it Father?
Teacher struck me.
He put the limes out into the snow.
May Chester said my limes must have been donated to Hope House.
Then I said that she wouldn't get a single lime from me.
And then she told Mr. Davis they were hidden in my desk... and then he struck me.
We oughta go over there and beat the tar out of him with his own stick!
Jo, we must not embrace violence.
- I'll write this man a letter.
- A letter?
That'll show him.
You failed to mention to me they were forbidden.
A whole month's rag money?
- Amy, I shouldn't have given it to you.
- I'm sorry!
All those lovely limes.
I'm perfectly "desolated."
I'm not sorry you lost them.
It's a frivolous concern in times like these.
You are more intent upon reshaping your dear little nose... than in fashioning your character.
It's an appalling school.
Your spelling's atrocious... your Latin absurd.
Mr. Davis said it was as useful to educate a woman... as to educate a female cat.
I shall strangle Mr. Davis!
" Mr. Davis... what right have you to strike a child?
In God's eyes we are all children and we are all equals.
If you hit and humiliate a child, the only lesson she will learn... is to hit and humiliate."
Amy, do you think you can discipline yourself... to learn at home as Beth has done?
"I withdraw my daughter Amy from your school."
It serves the scoundrel right!
Jo will now supervise your education.
Jo, tell me what happens next... after the Duke turns his back on his family fortune and saves Lady Zara.
Don't know.
It's all murder and gore.
The damsel's in distress.
Oh, I love your damsels in distress.
Oh, Beth, truly, I don't know if I could ever be good like Marmee.
I rather crave violence.
If only I could be like Father... and go to war and stand up to the lions of injustice.
And so Marmee does in her own way.
Yes.
But I want to do something different!
I don't know what it is yet, but I'm on the watch for it.
You will find it, Jo.
Hello!
Jo!
Come over here.
You too, Meg.
It's dull as tombs around here.
Mr. Laurence, one doesn't shout at ladies as if they were cattle.
My apologies.
All right.
What do those girls do over there all day?
Over the mysteries of female life... there is drawn a veil best left undisturbed.
Oh, dear Countess, pray for me... for I have sinned against meself and me brother Rodrigo.
You've got to say sinned as if you've really sinned!
Sinned!
Sinned!
Rodrigo!
You arrive seeking the Duke of Lankershire.
Hark ye.
Who goes there?
Oh, I forgot the cymbals.
Why it's...
it's Rodrigo!
- Rodrigo?
- I want to be Lady Violet.
I'm "exhaustified" of being the boy.
The play is the thing, Amy!
You're too little to be Lady Violet.
Here, be the Countess de Montanescu.
- You don't have any lines.
- Besides who would be our Rodrigo?
Gentlemen...
I propose the admission of a new member to our theatrical society.
Theodore Laurence.
We'll put it to a vote.
Nay.
He'll laugh at our acting and poke fun at us later.
He'll think it's only a game.
No, he won't.
Upon my word as a gentleman.
Jo, when it's only ladies, we don't guard our conduct in the same way.
We bear our souls and tell the most appalling secrets.
- He would find us improper.
- Teddy would do nothing of the sort.
Oh, please?
Let's try him.
Shall we?
- Jo!
- Traitor!
Fellow artists, may I present myself... as an actor, a musician, and a loyal and very humble servant of the club.
We'll be the judge of that.
In token of my gratitude, and as a means of promoting... communication between adjoining nations... shouting from windows being forbidden, I shall provide... a post office in our hedge... to further encourage the baring of our souls... and the telling of our most appalling secrets.
I do pledge... never to reveal what I receive in confidence here.
Well then... do take your place, Rodrigo.
Sir...
Rodrigo.
And so Laurie was admitted as an equal into our society... and we March girls could enjoy the daily novelty... of having a real brother of our very own.
I want to go to the theater.
- I never get to go anywhere.
- You're too little.
Beth, where in tarnation are Marmee's opera glasses?
I'm not too little.
You're just hogging Laurie.
Please, can't I go?
Oh, Amy, I'm afraid Laurie only reserved four seats.
Do I look too shabby?
Oh, Jehoshaphat, Meg, this isn't a coronation.
It's just Laurie and that awful Mr. Brooke.
Jo, can't you ask Teddy to get another ticket?
No!
You have a cold, dear.
Rest your eyes.
Evangeline and I will make you some ginger tea.
You're weeks behind in algebra.
Do all the pages that I've marked.
I won't have a sister who's a lazy ignoramus.
- Don't sulk.
You look like a pigeon.
- Coo!
Coo!
Good night.
You'll be sorry for this, Jo March!
Whoa!
Whoa, there.
Thank you.
Oh, Mrs. Nell Watson.
Wasn't she a wonderful swooner?
If only I were the swooning type!
If only I were the catching type.
Young Laurence informs me... you are an aficionado of the theater, Miss March.
- Well, I-
- I enjoy reading plays.
- Yes.
I, I find it most pleasurable myself.
Though I confess I'm distracted at the theater... thinking of the peculiar lives of the actors themselves.
When one considers the immodesties Mrs. Nell Watson suffers... one wonders what sort of lady would seek such a life.
Meg is a sensational actress!
We're always putting on wild theatricals.
It's just something that we play at.
Well, as, as a matter of fact... at school I engaged in debating.
What do you think of that?
Let's see what they do.
- I had a wonderful time, Mr. Brooke.
- As did I.
It was a most delightful evening.
- And I'd very much like--
- Thank you very much.
Good night.
- Oh, good night.
- Good night.
- That was rude.
- You plastered yourself on him.
It's proper to take a gentleman's arm if it's offered.
How was the theater?
Amusing?
It was wonderful!
I was absolutely inspired by the love scene.
You look flushed, Meg dear.
Was the theater overcrowded?
Still sulking?
Beth, where did I put my manuscript?
Beth?
No!
Oh, no.
I didn't do it!
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!
Marmee, help me!
I'm gonna kill you!
Do you hear me?
- How can you do this to me?
- Jo!
- Jo, stop.
You're hurting her.
- Marmee!
- Marmee!
- Jo!
Jo!
Let go of her!
- What's happened?
All right, all right.
- I hate you!
No, Jo!
Don't touch it.
Come.
Just let it go.
You're dead!
You're nothing!
I never want to see you again!
It is a very great loss, and you have every right to be put out.
But don't let the sun go down upon your anger.
Forgive each other.
Begin again tomorrow, huh?
I will never forgive her.
I'm sorry, Jo.
Looks like the last ice we'll have this year.
Say "go."
Laurie, Jo, wait for me!
Ignore her.
Ready-
- Blast!
Jo, please!
- Amy!
- Jo!
Hold on.
I'm coming!
Hold on, Amy.
Get a rail!
Grab the stick, Amy.
- Grab it!
- Come on!
Hold on!
There we go.
That's it, that's it.
Josephine March, you walked all the way from Walden Pond...
- in only these bloomers?
- As if she even noticed.
Dear Amy.
How could I have been so horrible?
Thank God for Laurie.
Jo, do you love Laurie more than you love me?
Oh, don't be such a beetle!
I could never love anyone as I love my sisters.
I'm not a beetle.
Oh, look out.
You're leaving out the best part.
When Lady Zara succumbs to the Duke's rival.
Oh, right, yes!
Sir Hugo.
I quite prefer him myself.
In the spring, we turned Orchard House upside down... with preparations for Meg to attend Sally Moffat's coming out.
Myself, I'd sooner have been hung by the neck than attend a fancy ball.
Wait 'til all of Boston sees you in this dress, Meg.
I told Laurie he has to show you off and keep you from being a wallflower... upon penalty of death.
Oh, where is that miserable glove?
Abigail, I shake my head at the way you're managing Margaret.
How is she to be married without a proper debut?
Now, Auntie, in our present circumstances--
Your circumstances will not change with your husband's return.
My nephew is as foolish with money as he is in his new philosophies.
The one hope for your family is for Margaret to marry well... though I don't know who marries governesses.
Marmee!
And this one has entirely ruined her disposition with books.
Oh, are those for me, Josephine?
No.
Meg's taking them to the Moffat's.
Marmee, Meg's frantic.
She lost her glove, and she only has one pair.
She cannot go without gloves.
The Moffats are society.
You're absolutely correct.
Tell Meg she may borrow mine.
Meg, you can take Marmee's!
Oh, dear!
Ohh!
- More tea?
- No, thank you.
Sally Moffat, you won't be able to draw your laces.
At my coming out party, I didn't eat for weeks beforehand.
Oh, Meg, I do like that color on you.
It's just like forget-me-nots.
The nicest I've seen that kind of fabric since the war broke out.
But you had it made up so plain.
Well, I-- I do my own sewing, and--
Mrs. Finster's on Charles Street carries silk pieces ready-made.
- Tomorrow I'll take you there.
- Marches haven't bought silk in years.
They have views on slavery.
Meg, isn't it true your father's school had to close... when he admitted a little dark girl?
The silk of Mrs. Finster's isn't milled in the South.
It's made right here, over in Linfield.
This isn't China silk?
They use little children for labor.
All the silk mills do.
The poor are always with us.
You are so good to remind us.
May I tell you something?
This is an afternoon dress.
I'm going to make you my pet.
Tonight Miss March shall have as many conquests as she likes.
You have no corset.
Come on.
Not for me, thank you.
No, I believe the next dance is the polka... with me.
I would dance with you, Mr. Parker... but I fear for my new slippers.
My credo is, " Don't tread on me."
Miss March.
I thought your family were temperance people.
Laurie.
Oh, don't cover up.
There may be one or two gentlemen here... who haven't seen all of your charms.
I did promise Jo I would show you off.
The girls dressed me up, and I rather like it.
Yes, it reveals a whole new Meg.
What do you call this?
Meg!
I'm sorry.
Please don't tell Jo how I've behaved.
Of course not.
If you won't tell anyone how I've behaved.
I was only playing a part... to see how it felt to be Belle Gardiner... with four proposals and 20 pairs of gloves.
You're worth ten of those other girls.
Did you see the way this March girl has gone after the Laurence heir?
Best thing that could happen to the Marches.
Oh!
This ridiculous dress!
I've been tripping over it all night.
Tie something around your neck where it can do you some good.
I don't like people speculating about Laurie and our Meg... as if they were characters in some play.
Nothing provokes speculation more... than the sight of a woman enjoying herself.
Why is it Laurie may do as he likes, flirt and tipple champagne--
And no one thinks the less of him?
Well, I suppose for one practical reason:
Laurie is a man, and as such... he may vote, hold property and pursue any profession he pleases.
And so he is not so easily demeaned.
Why should anyone care what they think?
I do.
It's nice to be praised and admired.
I couldn't help but like it.
Of course not!
I only care what you think of yourself.
If you feel your value lies in being merely decorative...
I fear that someday you might find yourself... believing that's all that you really are.
Time erodes all such beauty, but what it cannot diminish... is the wonderful workings of your mind.
Your humor, your kindness... and your moral courage.
These are the things I cherish so in you.
I so wish I could give my girls a more just world.
I know you'll make it a better place.
Hmm?
"...resounded, resounded with song of the nightingale."
No.
No, I don't want them now.
And keep the music.
I won't be going near a piano for ages.
You need your books in college.
Here's your Dombey and Sons.
I could've sworn there was another volume.
Honestly, Jo...
I won't be taking all of Dickens to Harvard with me.
Oh, no.
You'll have much more important things to read.
Nothing's going to change, Jo.
I wish I could go.
I wish you could too.
You'll come back knowing all sorts of things I don't know... and then I'll hate you.
Oh.
Well, as it happens...
I already know something you don't know.
About Meg and a certain former tutor of mine... soon to be employed at the firm of Laurence and Laurence.
Liar.
Has Meg mislaid a certain personal article... such as a glove?
Meg, John Brooke stole your glove!
What glove?
N-Not my white one?
Brooke's had it forever.
Laurie says he keeps it in his pocket.
You must tell him to return it.
Hannah, don't you think he oughta give it back?
'Tisn't what I think that matters.
Jo?
Meg?
It's, uh, a telegram... from Washington Hospital.
Your father's been wounded.
- Come on, Amy.
That's it.
- There are six.
The household account is in this ledger.
It should see you through the month.
- Of course.
Don't worry about us.
- Oh, Beth?
Look in on the Hummels for me, will you?
I will, Marmee.
Where's Jo?
It's almost 6:00.
Doing battle with Aunt March for Marmee's railway ticket.
Carry a letter to Mrs. Juba at the Hope House.
John!
Mr. Brooke.
I've come to offer myself as an escort to your mother.
Cook packed this up... and Grandfather sends a bottle of spirits for Mr. March.
- That's lovely.
Thank you.
- Marmee?
- Mr. Brooke is here.
- Mrs. March.
Mr. Brooke.
As young Laurence no longer requires a tutor...
Mr. Laurence has commissions for me in Washington.
I should like to be of service to you there.
- We couldn't let you travel alone.
- Mr. Brooke, how kind of you.
- May I?
- Thank you.
Are we to go on the 6:00 train?
Yes, I sent Jo off, but she hasn't--
- I'm here!
- Jo.
Finally.
Twenty-five.
Can Aunt March spare this?
I couldn't bear to ask her.
- I sold my hair.
- Jo, how could you?
Your one beauty.
It isn't going to affect the state of the Union.
- It'll grow back.
- It suits you.
Tell Father that we love him.
- Tell him we pray for him.
- Bring him home.
- I'll never forget his kindness.
- Hannah, thank you.
Oh, I shall miss my little women.
Are you thinking about Father?
No.
My hair.
- A little harder.
- Yeah, I hit him on the noggin.
Wait for me!
Blast!
Oh, dear.
- This stove!
- We'll eat them anyway.
There's no more cornmeal nor coffee.
The grocer won't let us have more on account.
- What can I bring the Hummels?
- Oh, fry the Hummels!
- You spent hours there last week.
- The boys are sick.
I mustn't write of this to Marmee.
- She has enough burdens now.
- I hate money!
Your potatoes!
Come on!
Here!
Air the beds.
And be careful cleaning.
- And don't forget your studies, Amy.
- I won't.
I will.
Go!
- Beth!
- Christine.
I don't understand.
I brought you a potato.
- Laurie's home for the weekend!
- In need of funds, no doubt.
We'd have a week's groceries with what he spends on billiards.
Oh, Jehoshaphat!
Meg!
Meg, you won't believe it!
I've sold the Lost Duke of Gloucester!
Five whole dollars!
I'm an author!
- Beth?
- The Hummel baby is sick.
I feel so strange.
She's burning up, but she says that she's freezing.
She has a terrible thirst, but she won't drink.
Sounds like arsenicum, but she looks more like belladonna.
I saw the Hummels.
Two children taken up to Jesus.
Scarlet fever.
You and Miss Jo won't be harmed.
You had it when you were babies.
But, Miss Amy, we have to send you away.
She won't die.
Will she, Laurie?
God wouldn't let her die.
I don't wanna go away.
I'll come and see you every day.
I swear it.
You won't be alone.
I'm afraid of Aunt March.
If she's unkind to you...
I'll come and take you away.
Where will we go?
Paris?
If I get scarlet fever and die... give Meg my box with the green doves on it.
- And Jo must have my turquoise ring.
- I'll see to that.
I don't wanna die.
I've never even been kissed.
I've waited my whole life to be kissed.
And what if I miss it?
I tell you what.
I promise to kiss you before you die.
Whoa!
I don't know.
I don't think Marmee should leave Father.
Beth needs Marmee.
She depends on her.
But what if we send for her and Father gets worse?
How in the name of all that's holy would we pay for the train?
"That he profane not my 'sancteraries'--"
- Sanctuary.
- "Sanctuaries.
For I, the Lord, do sanctify them.
And Moses told it unto Aaron and to his sons... and unto all the children of Israel."
Go on.
"And the Lord spake unto Moses saying--"
Jo, Mr. Laurence is here.
If we may, I wish my personal physician, Dr. Bangs... to examine the little girl.
There's nothing to be done.
If I bleed her, it would finish her.
- Best to send for the mother.
- Forgive me.
I've already done so.
Mrs. March arrives on the train this night.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women and--
Cricket, Marmee's here.
Icy cold.
Jo.
Jo, fetch a basin with vinegar water and rags.
Meg, my kit.
Must draw the fever down from her head.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right now.
That's my love.
Beth!
And so our dear Beth came back to us... although the fever had weakened her heart forever.
We did not know then that a shadow had fallen.
We prepared for another Christmas without Father.
Try each corner.
Thank you.
No, no!
One bow is enough!
Mr. Laurence.
Thank you.
- Oh.
I'm so sorry.
- It happens all the time.
Here she comes!
- Come on!
Come on!
- What should I do with these bows?
Now, don't scare her to death.
She's been sick, you know.
Hide the chairs.
Hide them, Amy!
Quick.
The house is beautiful.
They're friends of mine from college.
Freddy Vaughan and Averill Watson.
They won't bite.
No, don't sit there!
Sit--
Here.
Sit here child.
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Beth!
- Merry Christmas, Beth!
I should have given it to you long ago.
It belonged to my little girl... who had to leave us when she was very young.
But now, it will make music again.
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.
Play something, Beth.
Shall I?
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la La la la la
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la La la la la
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa la la la la la La la la
Troll the ancient yuletide carol
Fa la la la la La la la la
See the blazing yule before us
Fa la la la la La la la la
Strike the harp and join the chorus
Fa la la la la La la la la
Follow me in merry measure
Fa la la la la la La la la
While I tell of yuletide treasure
Fa la la la la La la la la
That was good.
I fear you would have a long engagement.
Three or four years.
John must secure a house before you can marry... and he must do a service to the Union.
John?
Marry?
You mean that pokey old Mr. Brooke?
How did he weasel his way into this family?
John has been very kind to go visit father in the hospital every day.
He's dull as powder.
Meg, can't you at least marry someone amusing?
I'm fond of Mr. Brooke.
He's a good man.
He's kind and serious... and I'm not afraid of being poor.
Marmee, you can't just let her go and marry him.
I'd hardly just go and marry anyone.
I would rather Meg marry for love and be a poor man's wife... than marry for riches and lose her self-respect.
So you don't mind that John is poor?
No, but I would rather he have a house.
Why must we marry at all?
Why can't things just stay as they are?
It is only a proposal.
Nothing need be decided.
Now, girls... let's not spoil the day.
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn king
Glory to the newborn king
Peace on earth
- Father?
- And mercy mild
- Father!
- Merry Christmas, everyone.
What a wonderful Christmas present!
Oh, Father, you're home!
Oh, you're more handsome than ever!
Beth, my little cookie.
Thank God you're well.
Give the man room to breathe.
Jo!
Oh, my wild girl!
Well, this could become the fashion.
- Watch his arm.
Be careful.
- I'm not used to this.
Be very careful now.
Don't coddle this soldier too much.
Oh, Father!
Hannah, God bless you.
It's good to see you.
It's good to have you home, Mr. March.
Now, let me look at my girls.
Take them and give them--
The cholera took more men than the rebs, as I understand it, sir.
Agriculture isn't taught, and it should be.
It should be required.
Perhaps the freedmen should be given land in the West.
- What happened between you and John?
- Never you mind.
Isn't it wonderful, Jo?
Yes, it's wonderful.
Welcome home, soldier.
Would you like some water, sir?
From our birth
Over and around us lies
Lord of all to Thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise
Change will come as surely as the seasons and twice as quick.
We make our peace with it as best we can... or as Amy once said when she was still a little girl:
"We'll all grow up someday.
We might as well know what we want. "
Sun and moon and stars of light
Lord of all to Thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise
Lord of all to Thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise
So you feel our Amy has talent?
Oh, Miss March excels at drawing... but, you know, her landscapes lack emotion.
I definitely feel Amy would benefit from further study... but she won't get it around here.
Where do you suggest?
Cape Cod has a fine artist colony... but Europe is the best place.
Your houseman said you wouldn't be home till night.
- I couldn't wait so long.
- Hail the conquering graduate!
Is Grandfather exceedingly proud?
Yes, and exceedingly bent on locking me up in one of his offices.
Why is it Amy may paint china and you can scribble away... while I must manfully set my music aside?
Why must you?
If I don't...
I'd have to defy Grandfather.
Yes, and not the whole of society.
I can't go against the old man.
When I imagine myself in that life...
I can think of only one thing... that would make me happy.
Oh, no, Teddy.
Teddy, don't.
No, wait, Teddy.
We have to talk about this reasonably.
I have loved you... since the moment I clamped eyes on you.
Would could be more reasonable than to marry you?
- We'd kill each other.
- Nonsense.
- Neither of us can keep our temper.
- I can... unless provoked.
We're both stupidly stubborn, especially you.
- We'd only quarrel.
- I wouldn't!
You can't even propose without quarreling.
Dear Jo, I swear I'll be a saint.
I'll let you win every argument.
I'll take care of you and your family.
I'll give you every luxury you've ever been denied.
You won't have to write unless you want to.
Grandfather... wants me to learn the business in England.
Can't you see us bashing around London?
London.
Oh, Teddy, I'm not fashionable enough for London.
You need someone who's elegant and refined.
I want you.
Teddy, please, don't ask me.
- Teddy, I'm desperately sorry.
- No.
- I do care for you...
- No.
with all of my heart.
You're my dearest friend.
I just can't go be a wife.
You say you won't, but... you will.
I won't.
One day... you'll meet some man.
A good man.
And you will love him tremendously.
And you will live and die for him.
- Teddy, please.
- You will.
I know you.
And I'll be hanged... if I stand by and watch.
Jo, are you ill?
She has refused Laurie.
Well, I'm sure she can take it back.
It's just a misunderstanding.
Listen to him.
I must get away.
Of course.
Aunt March is going to France.
France!
That's ideal!
I'll put up with anything to go!
Aunt March has asked me to go.
To Europe?
My Europe?
When?
It was decided just today.
Well, I am her companion now.
She wishes me to study painting abroad... in hopes I might make a good match there.
But perhaps she wouldn't mind if you stayed at Plumfield... while we are gone.
Of course Aunt March prefers Amy over me.
Why shouldn't she?
I'm ugly and awkward, and I always say the wrong things.
I fly around throwing away perfectly good marriage proposals.
I love our home, but I'm just so fitful that I can't stand being here!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Marmee.
There's just something really wrong with me.
I want to change, but I can't... and I just know I'll never fit in anywhere.
Jo, you have so many extraordinary gifts.
How can you expect to lead an ordinary life?
You're ready to go out and find a good use for your talent.
Although I don't know what I shall do without my Jo.
Go... and embrace your liberty... and see what wonderful things come of it.
Laurie sought his refuge in London and abroad.
Marmee helped me find a place in the great city of New York... and so I stepped over the divide between childhood and all that lay beyond.
Mrs. Kirk?
Josephine!
- Yes.
How do you do?
- Kitty, Minnie.
This is Miss March.
Her father was Colonel March.
He knew your papa.
- It was cold.
- Watch your feet, Mr. Costigan.
- Do come in, my dear.
- You're making that up.
Dear Beth:
Marmee's friend, Mrs. Kirk, has made me feel quite at home.
My little students, Kitty and Minnie, are dear girls.
How curious to grow up in a busy boarding house... with no father and your own mother the innkeeper.
I felt bold on leaving Concord... but I confess I find New York rough and strange... and myself strange in it.
Please pass these down the table.
Thank you kindly, Professor.
Mrs. Kirk believes that I am here... for a brief interlude of sensational experience... before succumbing to a matrimonial fate.
Excuse me, miss.
And while there is surely no lack of sensational experience... of every kind available in such a city...
- Come in!
- I hope, though I've had no luck yet... that any experience I gain here will be strictly literary... and that all events of a romantic or sensational nature... will be entirely confined to the page.
Our subscribers are not interested in sentiment and fairy stories, miss.
They're not fairy stories.
Try one of the ladies' magazines.
- Come on, Will!
Hurry up!
- I'm coming!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so clumsy.
You know that when first I saw you, I thought...
"Ah!
She is a writer."
What made you think so?
Yes, I know many writers.
In Berlin I was professor at the university.
Here I am just a humble tutor, I'm afraid.
Please, sit down.
Thank you.
You are far from home, Miss March?
- Do you miss your family?
- Oh, very much.
My sisters especially.
And Laurie.
She is your sister?
No, he's a friend.
You like your coffee?
Oh, it's... just very strong.
I like it.
You have quite a library.
Did you bring all these books from Germany?
A few of them.
- May I?
- Of course.
Most of these I could not bear to leave behind.
I sold everything that I own to get my passage to come here... but my books... never.
Shakespeare.
Some books are so familiar.
Reading them is like being home again.
Will you be returning to Berlin, Professor Bhaer?
Friedrich.
Call me Friedrich.
Friedrich.
No.
Sadly, the fatherland of Goethe and Schiller... is no more.
I adore Goethe.
My father used to read me all the German poets when I was a child.
Really?
That is most surprising.
My mother and father were part of... a rather unusual circle in Concord.
Do you know the word "transcendentalist"?
But this is German romantic philosophy.
We throw off all our constraints and we come to know ourselves... through insight and experience.
It got out of fashion now.
Not in the March family, I'm afraid.
It's just that with all of this transcendence... comes much emphasis on perfecting oneself.
This gives you a problem?
I'm hopelessly flawed.
If only we could... transcend ourselves without perfection.
Like your poet, Walt Whitman... who rides up and down the streets of Broadway all day... shouting poetry against the roar of the carts.
" Keep your silent woods, O Nature...
- "And your quiet places by the river--
- And your quiet places by the woods... by the woods.
Give me the streets of Manhattan."
I think we are all hopelessly flawed.
He is as poor as one might imagine an itinerant philosopher to be.
Yet, as the weeks go by, I see that he is unfailingly generous... to all of us who live in the house.
I am grateful to have a friend.
It is the system our nation was founded on.
Come now.
It was nothing short of a betrayal of our country's ideals.
Our country's ideals?
A constitution... that denies the basic rights of citizenship to women and black people?
They just passed the 15th Amendment, Jacob.
- They can vote.
- Black men can vote, Charles.
A lady has no need of suffrage if she has a husband.
- You don't take wine?
- Only medicinally.
Pretend that you've got a cold.
I agree, but if women are a moral force... shouldn't they have the right to govern and preach and testify in court?
What is it, Miss March?
I find it poor logic to say that because women are good... women should vote.
Men do not vote because they are good.
They vote because they are male.
And women should vote not because they are angels and men are animals... but because we are human beings and citizens of this country.
You should have been a lawyer, Miss March.
I should have been a great many things, Mr. Mayer.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, please.
Please, come in.
I have some good news.
A newspaper has published two of my stories, and they wish to see more.
This is wonderful.
Right there.
- The Daily Volcano?
- Yes.
"The Sinner's Corpse"... by Joseph March.
Lunatics.
Vampires.
This interests you?
People like thrilling stories, Friedrich.
This is what the newspapers want.
Yes.
Yes, I suppose.
I suppose that is true.
It will buy a new coat for Beth, and I'm sure she'll be grateful to have it.
I do not want to be your teacher.
No, understand me.
I am saying only that you should please yourself.
My opinion is of no importance.
Do you forgive me?
- Of course.
- Then I make a gift.
An experience.
Do you like the opera?
Oh, I do.
I mean, I think I do.
We don't seem to get a lot of opera in Concord.
I don't have an opera dress.
You will be perfect.
Where we are sitting, we shall not be so... formal.
Leila is a goddess.
She has made a promise never to love.
If she breaks her vow, all will be lost.
Oh, look.
Trouble is coming.
- What's going to happen?
- The inevitable.
Leila's soul is opening.
She's drawn to an idea.
He says, " Love has a fatal power."
Your heart... understood mine.
In the depth of the fragrant night...
I listened with ravished soul... to your beloved voice.
Your heart understood mine.
Oh, Laurie!
You wicked!
We heard you were in Greece or somewhere.
Laurie!
Come!
Come!
You've been much occupied with business, I am sure.
I'm not pursuing business just now.
Grandfather agreed I should concentrate... on my music for a while.
You know Fred Vaughan?
- Freddy.
- Good day, Laurence.
Yes.
I see you've taken up a passion for art, Freddy.
Aunt March, you look splendid.
I cannot say the same for you, my boy.
Amy dear.
- Will you be long?
I must retire.
- Yes, Aunt March.
Do come see us.
- Are they engaged?
- Not yet.
Hop, hop.
One, two, three, four.
Hop, hop, hop, turn.
Friedrich, how long would it take strychnine to dissolve in brandy?
Oh.
About eight minutes?
And is a dagger worn at the waist, or is that a saber?
I think that in these novels... the dagger is usually concealed in the boot... by a man with a dark moustache.
Go this way.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Oh, Laurie, how lovely.
It isn't what it should be, but you have improved it.
Please don't.
I liked you much better when you were blunt and natural.
It did not serve me well.
I find you changed.
In fact, I despise you.
You laze about spending your family's money and courting women.
You aren't serious about music.
My compositions are like your paintings:
mediocre copies of another man's genius.
Then why don't you go to Grandfather in London and make yourself useful?
I should.
Why don't you reform me?
I've someone more practical in mind.
You do not love Fred Vaughan.
Fred Vaughan is stable and well-mannered--
And has 40,000 a year.
I've always known I would not marry a pauper.
I expect a proposal any day.
You'll regret it.
I'll regret it.
I'm reminded of a promise.
Didn't I say I would kiss you before you die?
Do you hear from Jo?
She has befriended a German professor.
Yes.
No doubt he's showing her... the ways of the world.
I do not wish to be courted by someone who is still in love with my sister!
I'm not in love with Jo.
Then how do you explain your jealousy?
I envy her happiness.
I envy his happiness.
I envy John Brooke for marrying Meg.
I hate Fred Vaughan.
If Beth had a lover, I would despise him too.
Just as you have always known you would never marry a pauper...
I have always known...
I should be part of the March family.
I do not wish to be loved for my family.
Any more than Fred Vaughan wishes to be loved for his 40,000 a year.
My darling Amy.
It is you I want and not your family.
I've gone to London to make myself worthy of you.
Please, do not do anything we shall regret.
Monsieur Vaughan, mademoiselle.
May I show him in?
- Friedrich, did you read it?
- Yes.
It's well written, Jo.
And the first novel.
What a great accomplishment.
I'm going to be showing it to your publisher friend, Mr. Fields, today.
He liked "The Sinner's Corpse."
What is it?
Mr. Fields is a good man.
He will give you an honest opinion.
Oh, I see.
What is your honest opinion?
- I'm a professor of philosophy.
- No, I'd like to know what you think.
You should be writing from life... from the depths of your soul.
There is nothing in here of the woman that I am privileged to know.
Friedrich, this is what I write.
My apologies if it fails to live up to your high standards.
Jo, there is more to you than this... if you have the courage to write it.
Why didn't you tell me?
One hardly speaks of such things.
Oh, how wonderful.
How is Beth?
You will find her much altered.
Marmee.
She wouldn't let us send for you sooner.
The doctor has been here a number of times... but it's beyond all of us, and I think--
I think she's been waiting for you... before--
You're going to drink up all of this good broth.
I'm glad you're home.
So am I.
" Mr. Pickwick changed color.
'Ah,' said Mr. Wartle.
'Well, that's important.
There's nothing suspicious then, I suppose."'
I feel stronger with you close by.
I'm going to get you better yet.
If God wants me with Him, there is none who will stop Him.
I don't mind.
I was never like the rest of you... making plans about the great things I'd do.
I never saw myself as anything much.
Not a great writer like you.
Beth, I'm not a great writer.
But you will be.
Oh, Jo, I've missed you so.
Why does everyone want to go away?
I love being home.
But I don't like being left behind.
Now I am the one going ahead.
I am not afraid.
I can be brave like you.
But I know I shall be homesick for you... even in heaven.
I won't let you go.
Oh, my Jo.
Aunt March is bedridden and would not survive a sea voyage.
Amy must bide her time and return later.
It's just as well.
Will we never all be together again?
Lovely morning.
Thank you, sir.
Dearest Laurie:
You may not have heard our sad news of Beth's--
" Meg has entered her confinement... and poor Amy must stay in Vevey with Aunt March."
This is far too great a sorrow to bear alone.
Please come home to us, Teddy dear.
Your faithful, Jo.
I knew you would come.
The real charm of it lay in Beth's happy face... as she leaned over the new piano and lovingly touched... the beautiful black and white keys.
During the next few minutes, the rumor circulated... that Amy March had got 24 delicious limes.
I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you... that they powdered and squeezed and made me look a fashion plate.
As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet.
A general outcry arose, for all her abundant hair was cut short.
Jo, how could you?
Your one beauty.
Nothing's going to change, Jo.
For the beauty of the earth
For the glory of the skies
For the love which from our birth
Over and around us lies
Lord of all to Thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise
Surprise!
John, you have a daughter.
And a son.
Oh, Marmee, I can't believe you did this four times.
Yes, but never two at once, my darling.
Oh, Daisy.
Oh, Meg, she's so beautiful.
And him.
He is handsome.
He's going to look just like his papa when he grows up.
Yes, he does look like John.
Have you heard from the professor?
We did not part well.
John and I don't always agree, but then we mend it.
Who could that be?
Oh, this is magic!
You are absolutely--
Covered in flour!
Oh, dear!
- Come in.
- No, Jo, not yet.
May I tell you something without the others?
You're my dear friend.
I'm glad that you shall be the first to know.
- What?
- May I present... my wife.
Oh, my!
- Here, flowers.
- Thank you.
Come in!
Brussels lace!
Oh!
I went to Europe to paint the great cathedrals... but I couldn't get our home out of my mind.
Oh, look how Amy has captured Orchard House.
- Lovely.
- Oh, it's beautiful.
Not as beautiful as I wanted, but I am still learning.
Dear little angel.
Jo, you must tell me the truth, as a sister... which is a relation stronger than marriage.
Do you mind at all?
Oh, no.
I was surprised.
Mind you, I had it on good authority that our Teddy... would never love another.
And now he's gone and gotten married.
It's good to hear you call me Teddy again.
At last, we're all family, as we always should have been.
You must promise me that you will always live close by.
I couldn't bear losing another sister.
Jo, it's so gloomy and chilly.
One would require an income just for the coal to heat this place.
What could the dear old girl have been thinking?
Most likely she felt sorry for me.
Decrepit homeless spinster!
Oh, poor Aunt.
Living here all those years alone in this useless old house.
Yes, her blessings became a burden because she couldn't share them.
Wouldn't this have made a wonderful school?
A school.
What a challenge that would be.
Hello, Tuppy.
Hello.
Good boy.
My book!
Someone's publishing my book.
- Someone's publishing my book!
- Heaven help us!
It came with no letter.
How did it arrive?
Foreign gentleman brung it.
Strange kind of name.
Can't think of it.
Oh, Fox, or Bear or such.
Bhaer!
Did you ask him to wait?
I thought he was one of Miss Amy's European friends... coming with a wedding gift.
I said, " Miss March and Mr. Laurie are living next door."
- Hannah, you didn't!
- Then he said he had a train to catch.
Friedrich!
Oh, Friedrich, thank you for my book.
When I didn't hear from you...
I thought you hated it.
Oh, no.
Reading your book was like opening a window... into your heart.
James Fields took it out of my hands, and he would not give it back to me.
I said, "Such news I have to give to her myself."
Well, it was a silly impulse.
No, not silly at all.
It's so good to see you.
- Come and meet my family.
- No, I--
Thank you, but...
I have to catch a train.
I am going to the West.
My ship leaves from Boston tomorrow morning.
Yes, the schools in the West are young.
They need professors and... they are not so concerned about the accent.
I don't mind it either.
See, my aunt left me Plumfield.
It isn't a field.
It's a house, actually.
A rather large house.
And it isn't really good for anything except a school... and I want a good school... one that would be open to anyone who wanted to learn, and, well...
I'll be needing someone who knows how to teach.
Is there nothing I might say to keep you here?
I confess that I was hoping that I might have a reason... to stay, but... congratulations on the celebration of your marriage.
Oh, no!
No, that's Amy.
That's my sister.
Amy and Laurie, actually.
No, I'm not married.
Please don't go so far away.
Jo.
Such a little name for-- for such a person.
Will you have me?
With all of my heart!
But I have nothing to give you.
My hands are empty.
Not empty now.
Is this too fast?
Harder!
(LAUGHING)
JO:
My sisters and I remember that winter as the coldest of our childhood.
A temporary poverty had settled upon our family some years before.
The war had made fuel and lamp oil scarce.
But necessity is indeed the mother of invention.
Somehow in that dark time, our family, the March family, seemed to create its own light.
Marmee!
Marmee's home!
Marmee!
Marmee!
Marmee!
Marmee!
We waited and waited!
We've been expectorating you for hours!
Have you, my darling?
Expecting, featherhead.
Oh, Marmee, you're frozen!
Yes, if you could see the people lined up outside of Hope House in this bitter cold.
Mmm, your cheeks are so warm.
Thank you, cricket.
You finished your Christmas bundles?
So many this year.
We were handing out...
Oh, how is your cold?
Better.
That's good.
We were handing out food as quickly as we could make up the baskets.
Now, Miss Amy, what is this in my pocket?
Father!
"My dearest family, I am well and safe.
"Our battalion is encamped on the Potomac."
Potomac.
Potomac.
"December makes a hard, cold season for all of us so far from home.
"I think of my girls day and night,
"and find my best comfort in your affection.
"I pray that your own hardships will not be too great to bear.
"Give them all my dear love and a kiss.
"Tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night."
(WHISPERING) Poor father.
I'm a selfish girl.
(EXCLAIMS)
Little ones.
MARMEE:
It's Christmas Eve.
Father wouldn't want us to be sad now.
(ALL SINGING) * Ding dong merrily on high
* In heav'n the bells are ringing
* Ding dong!
Verily the sky Is riv'n with angel singing
* Gloria
* Hosanna In Excelsis
To bed, Miss Amy.
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
Merry Christmas.
* Let steeple bells be swungen
* And "Io, io, io!"
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
* Gloria
Merry Christmas, love.
Love you.
I love you.
* Hosanna in excelsis!
My Jo.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Marmee.
* Hosanna In Excelsis
And don't sit up too late.
I won't.
* May you beautifully rime Your evetime song, ye singers *
(READS SOFTLY)
JO:
Late at night, my mind would come alive with voices and stories, and friends as dear to me as any in the real world.
I gave myself up to it, longing for transformation.
Oh, what miraculous food!
Isn't this just like the old days, Hannah?
Oh.
(CHUCKLES)
We shouldn't eat it.
We should just look at it.
I'm going to eat it.
Jo?
Jo, come down!
JO:
I'm awake!
Horrible piano.
Hannah's put together an absolute Christmas miracle.
Is that sausage?
Wait!
AMY:
Butter!
Oh, oh, isn't butter divinity?
Oh, God, thank you for this breakfast.
Jo, angel, fetch your Marmee.
She went out at the crack of dawn to see some Germans.
Hummel, the boy said.
Not a word of English.
His da's gone.
Six children and she's about to issue another.
May as well take 'em a stick of firewood.
Sure they haven't got any.
Or breakfast either.
Perhaps we could send the Hummels our bread.
Might as well send the butter too.
Butter's not much use without bread to put it on.
JO:
Oh, wonderful snow!
Don't you wish you could roll about in it like dogs?
Once one of our finest families.
JO:
Lovely weather for a picnic!
Come along, Theodore.
We'll be late for church.
Jo, you should let them speak first.
What will they think of us?
Oh, don't look back!
* Here we come a-wassailing Among the leaves so green
* And here we come a-wandering So fair to be seen.
* Love and Joy come to you, And to you your wassail too
* And God bless you and send you a Happy New Year
* And God send you a Happy New Year *
(GIRLS LAUGHING)
JO: "Knights and ladies, elves and pages, monks and flower girls
"All mingled gaily in the dance.
"Pauline cried out in horror as her bridegroom's mask fell,
"disclosing not her lover Ferdinand, but the face of his sworn enemy, Count Antonio.
"'Revenge is mine!

Continued in the following edition.
Excellent installment, Mr. Snodgrass.
Oh, I love forbidden marriages!
You ought to publish it, Jo.
Really!
Not just in The Pickwick Portfolio.
Mr. Tupman, are you demeaning our fine newspaper?
Mr. Winkle.
(CLEARS THROAT)
"One periwink..." Advertisement.
"One periwinkle sash belonging to Mr. N. Winkle,
"has been abscondated from the wash line,
"which gentleman, desires any reports leading to its recovery."
Gentlemen of the press, hear, hear!
I call to your attention our Mr. Tupman's The History of the Squash.
Oh, don't read mine.
Beth, this isn't a story.
It's a recipe.
Oh, dear, I never know what to write.
First rule of writing, Mr. Tupman, is never write what you know.
What do we think of the boy?
Is he a captive like Smee and Nicholas Nickleby?
He looks lonely.
You don't think he'll try to call?
Maybe he has a secret.
A tragic, European secret.
He's had no upbringing at all they say.
He was reared in Italy among artists and vagrants.
Doesn't he have a noble brow?
If I were a boy, I'd want to look just like that.
Imagine giving up Italy to come live with that awful old man!
Oh, Jo, please don't say "awful." It's slang.
I'd be terrified to live with him.
MEG:
I shouldn't mind living in such a fine house, and having nice things.
Oh, it doesn't seen like Christmas this year without presents.
I'm desperate for drawing pencils.
I wish I didn't have to work for Great-Aunt March, that crabby old miser.
And you, Beth.
What's your Christmas wish?
I'd like the war to end so Father can come home.
Oh, sweet Beth.
We all want that.
They do have a beautiful piano.
Wait till I'm a writer.
I'll buy you the best piano in creation.
And if she doesn't, you can come over and play mine.
When I marry, I'm going to be disgustingly rich.
And what if the man you love is a poor man, but good like Father?
Well, it isn't like being stuck with the dreadful nose you get.
One does have a choice to whom one loves.
BETH:
You have a lovely nose.
I wouldn't marry for the money.
I mean, what if his business goes bust?
Besides, down at The Eagle, they pay $5 for each story they print.
Why, I have ten stories in my head right now!
Gentlemen, I dislike all this money talk.
It isn't refined.
Well, if lack of attention to personal finances is a mark of refinement, then I'd say the Marches are the most elegant family in Concord.
We'll all grow up someday, Meg.
We might as well know what we want.
That'll do, that'll do.
Put the carriage away and look smart about it.
MAN:
Very good, sir.
LAURIE:
Merry Christmas!
I have the most wonderful feeling about tonight.
Meg and Jo, you have to tell me exquisitely everything about Belle Gardiner.
What her nose looks like and about her ring.
Annie Gardiner says it's an emerald.
Can you imagine?
Everyone's lucky but me.
I'm glad I don't have to go and be with those frightening people, and try to think of things to say.
Hush now.
Oh, mind you, Jo, don't eat much at supper.
And don't shake hands with people.
It isn't the thing anymore.
Jo, your dress!
Oh, I know!
You always stand too close to the fire.
Oh, dear.
Well, just keep your backside to the wall.
Meg, look.
What cunning little heels.
BETH:
They're rather small.
MEG:
That's all right.
It's only for one night.
You don't suppose anyone will notice they came out of the rag bag, do you?
You have to have heels.
(SNIFFING) What's that strange smell?
(SNIFFING)
AMY:
Like burnt feathers.
(EVERYONE SCREAMING)
HANNAH:
Heavens above!
You've ruined me!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have had me do it.
Meg, don't worry.
It'll grow back soon enough.
JO:
I spoil everything!
(GASPS) I can't go out like this!
Good!
I'm not going either.
Here, we'll place my bow in front.
BETH:
Yes, that covers it.
It's very becoming, Meg.
I'll never have any suitors.
I'll just be a dried-up old spinster.
You don't need scores of suitors.
You only need one, if he's the right one.
Listen to the child.
Meg isn't going to be married right away, is she?
With Jo's help, I never will.
Oh, you must be so happy.
Oh, Belle, it's enchanting.
Well, I best go and help mama.
Excuse me.
(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)
LADY:
I think it's Mrs. Barkley.
She's going to try it.
Watch her.
Oh, yes, I would like it very much.
(GASPS) Jehoshaphat!
I'm sorry.
No, no, stay!
It's not a bad hiding place.
You see, I don't know anyone so I felt awkward standing and staring at people.
Should I put on my jacket?
I never know the rules.
Um, um, I'm Laurie.
Theodore Laurence, but I'm, uh, I'm called Laurie.
Jo March.
So, who were you staring at?
Uh, you, actually.
What, what game were you playing?
I don't know, but I think I won.
Who else?
Well, I was...
I was quite taken with that one.
That's Meg.
That's my sister.
She's completely bald in front.
Is it true that you lived in Italy among artists and vagrant?
My mother was Italian.
A pianist.
Grandfather disapproved of her.
Truly?
I saw a play like that once.
Do you like the theater?
Oh, yes.
Were you born there?
Where?
In Italy.
Do you speak French or Italian?
English at home.
Francais a l'ecole.
The music conservatory in Vevey.
But grandfather's having me tutored now.
He insists I go to college.
Oh, I'd commit murder to go to college.
Actually, I'm going to Europe.
Well, at least I hope I am.
My Great-Aunt March says she'll go one of these days, and she has to take me with her because I work as her companion.
I have to read to her for hours and hours.
But I do all the voices!
I'll bet you do.
If I weren't going to be a writer, I'd go to New York and pursue the stage.
Are you shocked?
Very.
I'm sorry.
(JO GIGGLING)
I'm sorry.
Meg always makes me take the gentleman's part at home.
It's a shame you don't know the lady's part.
Why are you looking at the back of my dress?
You cheat.
It doesn't look so bad.
Honestly.
JO:
You promised you wouldn't look.
Oh, Jo, I've sprained my ankle.
I shouldn't wonder in those shoes!
Does it hurt?
Oh.
Oh, no, no.
I'm quite well, thank you.
This is our neighbor, Laurie, the captive.
Oh, poor Meg.
I'll go tell Mrs. Gardiner.
Oh, no, Jo.
She'll think I've been sampling the punch.
A perfectly good party ruined.
Well, I have my carriage.
Let me take you home.
Oh, yes!
Oh, no, thank you.
Thank you.
MARMEE:
Lean on me.
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.
That's very kind of you.
LAURIE:
Not at all.
Goodbye, Laurie.
Goodnight, Mrs. March.
Wherever did you get this shoe?
Did you ride in his carriage?
Oh, you two have all the luck.
Oh, Jo, is he very romantic?
Not in the slightest!
We're very much obliged to him, but, he's a dreadful boy.
Well, he did a good deed putting snow on this ankle.
He put snow on your ankle?
To bed, Miss Amy.
With his own hands?
Oh, stop being so swoony!
I won't have my girls being silly about boys.
To bed, Jo, dear.
Does this hurt?
Everything lovely happens to Meg.
Oh, yes indeed!
You mustn't be soppy about Laurie anymore than you should be soppy about those silly girls at school.
We shall be good friends with him.
With a boy?
He isn't a boy!
He's Laurie!
JO:
Faster!
Faster!
Faster!
(SCREAMING) Laurie!
Your young ladies are unusually active, Mrs. March, if I may say so.
You may indeed, Mr. Brooke.
It is my opinion that young girls are no different than boys in their need for exertion.
Feminine weakness and fainting spells are the direct result of our confining young girls to the house, bent over their needlework in restrictive corsets.
Marmee!
Your young student is an athlete.
He is, thank you, a good one.
But he makes an unruly scholar.
I regret that his grandfather is away much.
One hopes that your girls will be a gentling influence.
Indeed, Mr. Brooke.
Marmee, must you speak to everyone about corsets?
Oh, Meg.
Do I?
(LAUGHTER)
JO:
Blast these wretched skirts!
AMY:
Don't say "blast" and "wretch."
Amy, don't be such a ninny-pinny.
I wish I was Beth so I could stay home and do pleasant things.
Oh, if you call doing laundry and housework pleasant!
Blast!
MEG:
Amy, hurry.
I'll be late for work.
There's Mrs. King.
I'm tardy again.
Lovely children.
Oh, Meg, must I go to school?
I'm so degradatated.
I can hardly hold my head up.
I owe at least a dozen limes.
Limes?
Are limes the fashion now?
Of course they are.
It's nothing but limes now.
Everyone keeps them in their desks and trades them for beads and things.
And all the girls trade each other at recess.
If you don't bring limes to school, you're nothing.
You might as well be dead.
I've had ever so many limes and I can't pay anyone back.
Well, no wonder you don't learn anything at that school!
I know how it feels to do without any little luxuries.
Meg!
But we are not destitute, not yet.
Here's a quarter.
Marmee gave me the rag money this month.
Go on.
JO: "Secondly, the immortality of the soul
"is asserted to be in consequence
"of its immateriality
"as in all leipothymic cases
"consistent with the idea of immortality,
"and immorality, and physicality..."
(WHISPERING) And I think you finally dozed off.
(CRYING)
AUNT MARCH:
Josephine, there's a draft!
(BARKING)
Is it father?
Teacher struck me.
He put the limes out into the snow.
May Chester said my limes must have been donated to Hope House.
And then I said that she wouldn't get a single lime from me.
And then she told Mr. Davis they were hidden in my desk, and then he struck me.
We ought to go over there and beat the tar out of him with his own stick!
Jo, we must not embrace violence.
I'll write this man a letter.
A letter?
That'll show him.
MEG:
You failed to mention to me they were forbidden.
A whole month's rag money?
Amy, I shouldn't have given it to you.
I'm sorry!
All those lovely limes.
I'm perfectly desolated.
I'm not sorry you lost them.
It's a frivolous concern in times like these.
You are more intent upon reshaping your dear little nose than in fashioning your character.
It's an appalling school.
Your spelling's atrocious, your Latin absurd.
Mr. Davis said it was as useful to educate a woman as to educate a female cat.
I really must strangle Mr. Davis!
"Mr. Davis,
"what right have you to strike a child?
"In God's eyes we are all children and we are all equals.
"If you hit and humiliate a child, the only lesson she will learn
"is to hit and humiliate."
Amy, do you think you can discipline yourself to learn at home as Beth has done?
"I withdraw my daughter Amy from your school."
It serves the scoundrel right!
Jo will now supervise your education.
(SIGHS)
Jo, tell me what happens next.
After the duke turns his back on his family fortune and saves Lady Zara.
Don't know.
It's all murder and gore.
The damsel's in distress.
Oh, I love your damsels in distress.
Oh, Beth, truly, I don't know if I could ever be good like Marmee.
I rather crave violence.
If only I could be like father and go to war and stand up to the lions of injustice.
And so Marmee does in her own way.
Yes.
But I want to do something different!
I don't know what it is yet, but I'm on the watch for it.
You will find it, Jo.
Hello!
Jo!
Come over here.
You too, Meg.
Dull as tombs around here.
Mr. Laurence, one doesn't shout at ladies as if they were cattle.
My apologies.
(MEOWING)
All right.
(SIGHS)
What do those girls do over there all day?
Over the mysteries of female life there is drawn a veil best left undisturbed.
(HUMMING)
Oh, dear countess, pray for me, for I have sinned against meself and me brother Rodrigo.
You've got to say sinned as if you've really sinned!
Sinned!
Sinned!
Rodrigo!
You arrive seeking the Duke of Lankershire.
Hark ye.
Who goes there?
Oh, I forgot the cymbals.
Why it's...
It's Rodrigo!
Rodrigo?
I want to be Lady Violet.
I'm exhaustified of being the boy.
The play is the thing, Amy!
You're too little to be Lady Violet.
Here, be the Countess de Montanescu.
You don't have any lines.
Besides, who would be our Rodrigo?
(CLEARS THROAT) Gentlemen,
I propose the admission of a new member to our theatrical society.
Theodore Laurence.
We'll put it to a vote.
Nay.
He'll laugh at our acting and poke fun at us later.
He'll think it's only a game.
No, he won't.
Upon my word as a gentleman.
Jo, when it's only ladies, we don't guard our conduct in the same way.
We bear our souls and tell the most appalling secrets.
He would find us improper.
Oh, Teddy would do nothing of the sort.
Oh, please?
Let's try him.
Shall we?
(LAUGHING)
(GASPING) Jo!
AMY:
Traitor!
Fellow artists, may I present myself.
As an actor, a musician and a loyal and very humble servant of the club.
We'll be the judge of that.
In token of my gratitude, and as a means of promoting communication between adjoining nations, shouting from windows being forbidden, I shall provide
a post office in our hedge.
To further encourage the baring of our souls and the telling of our most appalling secrets.
I do pledge never to reveal what I receive in confidence here.
Well then, do take your place, Rodrigo.
Sir Rodrigo.
JO:
And so Laurie was admitted as an equal into our society, and we March girls could enjoy the daily novelty of having a real brother of our very own.
(GASPS)
I want to go to the theater.
I never get to go anywhere.
You're too little.
Beth, where in tarnation are Marmee's opera glasses?
AMY:
I'm not too little.
You're just hogging Laurie.
Please, can't I go?
Oh, Amy, I'm afraid Laurie only reserved four seats.
Do I look too shabby?
Oh, Jehoshaphat, Meg, this isn't a coronation.
It's just Laurie, and that awful Mr. Brooke.
Jo, can't you ask Teddy to get another ticket?
No!
You have a cold, dear.
Rest your eyes.
Evangeline and I will make you some ginger tea.
You're weeks behind in algebra.
Now, I want you to do all the pages that I've marked.
I won't have a sister who's a lazy ignoramus.
And don't sulk.
You look like a pigeon.
Coo!
Coo!
Goodnight.
You'll be sorry for this, Jo March!
(CARRIAGE APPROACHING)
MAN:
Whoa!
Whoa, there.
Oh.
Thank you.
Oh, Mrs. Nell Watson.
Wasn't she a wonderful swooner?
If only I were the swooning type.
If only I were the catching type.
Young Laurence informs me that you are an aficionado of the theater, Miss March.
Well, I enjoy reading plays.
Yes.
I find it most, most pleasurable myself.
Though I confess I'm distracted at the theater.
Thinking of the peculiar lives of the actors themselves.
When one considers the immodesties Mrs. Nell Watson suffers, one wonders what sort of lady would seek such a life.
Meg is a sensational actress!
We're always putting on wild theatricals.
Oh, it's just something that we play at.
Well, as, as a matter of fact, at school I engaged in debating.
What do you think of that?
Let's see what they do.
I had a wonderful time, Mr. Brooke.
As did I.
BROOKE:
It was a most delightful evening.
And I'd very much like...
Thank you very much.
Goodnight.
Oh, goodnight.
Goodnight.
That was rude.
You plastered yourself on him.
It's proper to take a gentleman's arm if it's offered.
MARMEE:
How was the theater?
Amusing?
It was wonderful!
I was absolutely inspired by the love scene.
You look flushed, Meg dear.
Was the theater overcrowded?
Still sulking?
(SIGHS)
(WHISPERING) Beth, where did I put my manuscript?
Beth?
No!
No!
No!
Oh, no.
I didn't do it!
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!
AMY:
Marmee, help me!
JO:
I'm gonna kill you!
Do you hear me?
How can you do this to me?
Jo!
Jo, stop it.
You're hurting her.
Marmee!
Jo!
Jo!
Let go of her!
What's happened?
I hate you!
I hate you!
No, Jo!
MARMEE:
Don't touch it.
MARMEE:
Come, just let it go.
You're dead!
You're nothing!
JO:
I never want to see you again!
It is a very great loss and you have every right to be put out.
But don't let the sun go down upon your anger.
Forgive each other.
Begin again tomorrow, huh?
I will never forgive her.
I'm sorry, Jo.
(CHATTING AND LAUGHING)
JO:
Looks like the last ice we'll have this year.
Say "Go."
Laurie, Jo, wait for me!
Ignore her.
Ready...
Blast!
Jo, please?
(CRACKLING)
(EXCLAIMS)
(AMY SCREAMS)
Amy!
Jo!
Hold on.
I'm coming!
JO:
Hold on, Amy.
Get a rail!
Grab the stick, Amy.
Grab it!
Come on!
Grab it!
LAURIE:
Hold on!
There we go.
That's it, that's it.
Josephine March, you walked all the way from Walden pond in only these bloomers?
As if she even noticed.
Dear Amy.
How could I have been so horrible?
Thank God for Laurie.
AMY:
Jo, do you love Laurie more than you love me?
Oh, don't be such a beetle!
I could never love anyone as I love my sisters.
I'm not a beetle.
Oh, look out.
You're leaving out the best part.
When Lady Zara succumbs to the duke's rival.
Oh, right, yes!
Sir Hugo.
I quite prefer him myself.
JO:
In the spring, we turned orchard house upside down with preparations for Meg to attend Sally Moffat's coming out.
Myself, I'd sooner have been hung by the neck than attend a fancy ball.
Wait till all of Boston sees you in this dress, Meg.
I told Laurie he has to show you off and keep you from being a wallflower.
Upon penalty of death.
Oh, where is that miserable glove?
Abigail, I shake my head at the way you're managing Margaret.
How is she to be married without a proper debut?
Now, Aunt, in our present circumstances...
Your circumstances will not change with your husband's return.
My nephew is as foolish with money as he is in his new philosophies.
The one hope for your family is for Margaret to marry well.
Though I don't know who marries governesses.
Marmee!
And this one has entirely ruined her disposition with books.
Oh, are those for me, Josephine?
No.
Meg's taking them to the Moffat's.
Marmee, Meg's frantic.
She lost her glove and she only has one pair.
She cannot go without gloves.
The Moffats are society.
You're absolutely correct.
Tell Meg she may borrow mine.
Meg, you can take Marmee's!
Oh, dear!
Oh!
More tea?
No, thank you.
Sally Moffat, you won't be able to draw your laces.
At my coming out party, I didn't eat for weeks beforehand.
Oh, Meg, I do like that color on you.
It's just like forget-me-nots.
The nicest I've seen that kind of fabric since the war broke out.
But you had it made up so plain.
Well, I do my own sewing and...
Mrs. Finster's on Charles street carries silk pieces ready-made.
Tomorrow I'll take you there.
Marches haven't bought silk in years.
They have views on slavery.
Meg, isn't it true your father's school had to close when he admitted a little dark girl?
The silk at Mrs. Finster's isn't milled in the South.
It's made right here, over in Linfield.
This isn't China silk?
They use little children for labor.
All the silk mills do.
The poor are always with us.
You are so good to remind us.
May I tell you something?
This is an afternoon dress.
I'm going to make you my pet.
Hortense?
(REPLYING IN FRENCH)
(GIVING DIRECTIONS IN FRENCH)
Tonight Miss March shall have as many conquests as she likes.
You have no corset.
(GASPS)
(WHISPERING) Come on.
(INDISTINCT CHATTING)
No, I believe the next dance is the polka.
With me.
Well, I would dance with you, Mr. Parker, but I fear for my new slippers.
My credo is, "Don't tread on me."
Miss March.
I thought your family were temperance people.
Laurie.
Oh, no.
No, don't cover up.
There may be one or two gentlemen here who haven't seen all of your charms.
I did promise Miss Jo I would show you off.
The girls dressed me up and I rather like it.
Yes, it reveals a whole new Meg.
What do you call this?
(WHISPERING) Meg.
I'm sorry.
Please don't tell Jo how I've behaved.
Of course not.
If you won't tell anyone how I've behaved.
I was only playing a part.
To see how it felt to be Belle Gardiner with four proposals and 20 pairs of gloves.
You're worth ten of those other girls.
LADY:
Did you see the way this March girl has gone after the Laurence heir?
Best thing that could happen to the Marches.
Oh!
This ridiculous dress!
I've been tripping over it all night.
Tie something around your neck where it can do you some good.
JO:
I don't like people speculating about Laurie and our Meg.
As if they were characters in some play.
MARMEE:
And nothing provokes speculation more than the sight of a woman enjoying herself.
Why is it Laurie may do as he likes and flirt and tipple champagne...
And no one thinks the less of him?
Well, I suppose for one, practical reason,
Laurie is a man and as such, he may vote, hold property and pursue any profession he pleases.
And so he is not so easily demeaned.
Why should anyone care what they think?
I do.
It's nice to be praised and admired.
I couldn't help but like it.
Of course not!
I only care what you think of yourself.
If you feel your value lies in being merely decorative,
I fear that someday you might find yourself believing that's all that you really are.
Time erodes all such beauty, but what it cannot diminish is the wonderful workings of your mind.
Your humor, your kindness.
And your moral courage.
These are the things I cherish so in you.
I so wish I could give my girls a more just world.
I know you'll make it a better place.
Hmm?
"...
Resounded, resounded with song of the nightingale."
No.
(SIGHS)
No, I don't want them now.
And keep the music.
I won't be going near a piano for ages.
You need your books in college.
Here's your Dombey and Sons.
I could've sworn there was another volume.
Honestly, Jo.
I won't be taking all of Dickens to Harvard with me.
Oh, no.
You'll have much more important things to read.
Nothing's going to change, Jo.
I wish I could go.
I wish you could too.
You'll come back knowing all sorts of things I don't know, and then I'll hate you.
Oh.
Well, as it happens,
I already know something you don't know.
About Meg, and a certain former tutor of mine, soon to be employed at the firm of Laurence and Laurence.
Liar.
Has Meg mislaid a certain personal article such as a glove?
Meg, John Brooke stole your glove!
What glove?
Not my white one?
Brooke's had it forever.
Laurie says he keeps it in his pocket.
You must tell him to return it.
Hannah, don't you think he ought to give it back?
Tisn't what I think that matters.
MARMEE:
Jo?
Meg?
It's a telegram from Washington hospital.
Your father's been wounded.
Come on, Amy.
That's it.
There are six.
The household account is in this ledger.
It should see you through the month.
Of course.
Don't worry about us.
Oh, Beth?
Dear, look in on the Hummels for me, will you?
I will, Marmee.
Where's Jo?
It's almost 6:00.
Doing battle with Aunt March for Marmee's railway ticket.
MARMEE:
Carry a letter to Mrs. Juba at the Hope House.
John!
Mr. Brooke.
I've come to offer myself as an escort to your mother.
Cook packed this up and grandfather sends a bottle of spirits for Mr. March.
Oh, that's lovely.
Thank you.
Marmee?
Mr. Brooke is here.
Mrs. March.
Mr. Brooke.
As young Laurence no longer requires a tutor,
Mr. Laurence has commissions for me in Washington.
I should like to be of service to you there.
We couldn't let you travel alone.
Mr. Brooke, how kind of you.
May I?
Thank you.
Are we to go on the 6:00 train?
Yes, I sent Jo off, but she hasn't...
I'm here!
Jo, finally.
$25?
Can Aunt March spare this?
I couldn't bear to ask her.
I sold my hair.
Jo, how could you?
Your one beauty.
It isn't going to affect the state of the union.
It'll grow back.
It suits you.
Tell father that we love him.
Tell him we pray for him.
Bring him home.
I'll never forget his kindness.
Hannah, thank you.
Oh, I shall miss my little women.
(JO CRYING)
Are you thinking about father?
No.
My hair.
Oh.
GIRL:
Little harder.
BOY:
Yeah, I hit him on the noggin.
Wait for me!
Blast!
Oh, dear.
This stove!
We'll eat them anyway.
There's no more cornmeal nor coffee.
The grocer won't let us have any more on account.
What can I bring the Hummels?
Oh, fry the Hummels!
You spent hours there last week.
The boys are sick.
I mustn't write of this to Marmee.
She has enough burdens now.
I hate money!
Your potatoes!
Come on!
Here!
MEG:
Air the beds.
And be careful cleaning.
And don't forget your studies, Amy.
AMY:
I won't.
I will.
Go!
Beth!
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
I don't understand.
I brought you a potato.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Laurie's home for the weekend!
In need of funds, no doubt.
We'd have a week's groceries with what he spends on billiards.
Oh, Jehoshaphat!
(EXCLAIMING)
Meg!
Meg, you won't believe it!
I've sold the Lost Duke of Gloucester!
Five whole dollars!
I'm an author!
Beth?
The Hummel baby is sick.
I feel so strange.
MEG:
She's burning up, but she says that she's freezing.
She has a terrible thirst, but she won't drink.
Sounds like arsenicum, but she looks more like belladonna.
HANNAH:
I saw the Hummels.
Two children taken up to Jesus.
Scarlet fever.
You and Miss Jo won't be harmed.
You had it when you were babies.
But Miss Amy, we have to send you away.
She won't die.
Will she, Laurie?
God wouldn't let her die.
I don't wanna go away.
I'll come and see you every day.
I swear it.
You won't be alone.
(SIGHS) I'm afraid of Aunt March.
If she's unkind to you,
I'll come and take you away.
Where will we go?
Paris?
(LAUGHING)
If I get scarlet fever and die, give Meg my box with the green doves on it.
And Jo must have my turquoise ring.
I'll see to that.
I don't wanna die.
I've never even been kissed.
I've waited my whole life to be kissed.
And what if I miss it?
I tell you what.
I promise to kiss you before you die.
(DOG BARKING)
MAN:
Whoa!
(GASPING)
MEG:
I don't know.
I don't think Marmee should leave father.
Beth needs Marmee.
She depends on her.
But what if we send for her and father gets worse?
How in the name of all that's holy would we pay for the train?
AMY:
"That he profane not my sancteraries..."
AUNT MARCH:
Sanctuary.
"Sanctuaries.
"For I, the Lord, do sanctify them.
"And Moses told it unto Aaron and to his sons.
"And unto all the children of Israel."
Go on.
(SIGHS)
"And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying..."
(KNOCKING AT DOOR) MEG:
Jo, Mr. Laurence is here.
If we may,
I wish my personal physician, Dr. Bangs, to examine the little girl.
There's nothing to be done.
If I bleed her, it would finish her.
Best to send for the mother.
LAURIE:
Forgive me.
I've already done so.
Mrs. March arrives on the train this night.
(WHISPERING) Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women and...
MEG:
Jo!
Cricket.
Marmee's here.
Icy cold.
Jo.
Jo, fetch a basin with vinegar water and rags.
Meg, my kit.
Must draw the fever down from her head.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right now.
That's my love.
(BIRD TWITTERING)
(SOBBING)
JO:
Beth!
JO:
And so our dear Beth came back to us, although the fever had weakened her heart forever.
We did not know then that a shadow had fallen.
We prepared for another Christmas without Father.
Try each corner.
Thank you.
AUNT MARCH:
No, no!
One bow is enough!
Mr. Laurence.
Thank you.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It happens all the time.
LAURIE:
How's this?
Here she comes!
Come on!
Come on!
What should I do with these bows?
AUNT MARCH:
Don't scare her to death.
She's been sick, you know.
Hide the chairs.
Hide them, Amy!
(WHISPERS) Quick.
(GIGGLING)
The house is beautiful.
They're friends of mine from college.
Freddy Vaughan and Averill Watson.
They won't bite.
No, don't sit there!
Sit...
Here.
Sit here, child.
Merry Christmas!
ALL:
Merry Christmas, Beth!
ALL TOGETHER:
Merry Christmas, Beth.
I should've given it to you long ago.
It belonged to my little girl who had to leave us when she was very young.
But now, it will make music again.
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Play something, Beth.
Shall I?

(CLAPPING) That was good!
MARMEE:
I fear you would have a long engagement.
Three or four years.
John must secure a house before you can marry.
And do his service to the union.
John?
Marry?
You mean that pokey old Mr. Brooke?
JO:
How did he weasel his way into this family?
Jo!
John has been very kind to go visit father in the hospital every day.
He's dull as powder!
Can't you at least marry someone amusing?
I'm fond of Mr. Brooke.
He's a good man.
He's kind and serious.
I'm not afraid of being poor.
Marmee, you can't just let her go and marry him!
MEG:
I'd hardly just go and marry anyone!
I would rather Meg marry for love and be a poor man's wife, than marry for riches and lose her self-respect.
So...
So you don't mind that John is poor?
No, but I would rather he have a house.
Why must we marry at all?
Why can't things just stay as they are?
It is only a proposal.
Nothing need be decided.
Now, girls!

Meg!
You're more handsome than ever!
Beth, my little cookie.
Thank God you're well.
AUNT MARCH:
Clear the way.
Give the man room to breathe.
Jo!
Oh, my wild girl!
Well, this could become the fashion.
MARMEE:
Watch his arm.
I'm not used to this.
Be careful.
Be very careful now.
Don't coddle this soldier too much.
Father, it's time...
AMY:
Oh, Father!
Hannah, God bless you.
It's good to see you.
It's good to have you home, Mr. March.
Now let me look at my girls.
Take them and give them...
The cholera took more men than the Rebs, as I understand it, sir.
Agriculture isn't taught, and it should be.
It should be required.
Perhaps the freedmen should be given land in the West.
What happened between you and John Brooke?
Never you mind.
Isn't it wonderful, Jo?
Yes, it's wonderful.

AUNT MARCH:
So you feel our Amy has talent?
Oh, Miss March excels at drawing.
But you know, her landscapes lack emotion.
I definitely feel Amy would benefit from further study.
But she won't get it around here.
AUNT MARCH:
Where do you suggest?
TEACHER:
Cape Cod has a fine artist colony.
But Europe is the best place.
Teddy!
Teddy!
Your houseman said you wouldn't be home till night.
I couldn't wait so long.
Hail the conquering graduate!
Is Grandfather exceedingly proud?
Yes.
And exceedingly bent on locking me up in one of his offices.
Why is it Amy may paint china and you can scribble away, while I must manfully set my music aside?
Why must you?
If I don't, I'd have to defy Grandfather.
Yes, and not the whole of society.
I can't go against the old man.
When I imagine myself in that life,
I can think of only one thing that would make me happy.
Oh, no.
Teddy.
Teddy, don't.
No, wait, Teddy.
We have to talk about this reasonably.
I have loved you since the moment I clamped eyes on you.
What could be more reasonable than to marry you?
We'd kill each other.
Nonsense!
Neither of us can keep our temper.
I can.
Unless provoked.
We're both stupidly stubborn, especially you.
We'd only quarrel!
I wouldn't!
You can't even propose without quarreling.
(CHUCKLING)
Jo.
Dear Jo.
I swear I'll be a saint.
I'll let you win every argument.
I'll take care of you and your family.
(SIGHS) I'll give you every luxury you've ever been denied.
You won't have to write.
Unless you want to.
Grandfather, wants me to learn the business in England.
Can't you see us bashing around London?
London.
Oh, Teddy, I'm not fashionable enough for London.
You need someone who's elegant and refined.
I want you.
Teddy, please don't ask me.
Teddy, I'm desperately sorry.
No, don't.
I do care for you.
No.
With all of my heart.
You're my dearest friend.
I just can't go be a wife.
You say you won't, but...
You will.
I won't!
I won't.
One day...
You'll meet some man.
A good man.
And you will love him tremendously.
And you will live and die for him.
Teddy, please.
You will!
Jo,
I know you.
And I'll be hanged, if I stand by and watch.
Jo, are you ill?
She has refused Laurie.
Well, I'm sure she can take it back.
It's just a misunderstanding.
No.
No.
(PIANO PLAYING)
Oh, listen to him.
(PIANO CONTINUES) I must get away.
Of course.
Aunt March is going to France.
Oh!
France!
That's ideal!
I'll put up with anything to go!
Aunt March has asked me to go.
To Europe?
My Europe?
JO:
When?
It was decided just today.
Well, I am her companion now.
She wishes me to study painting abroad, and hopes I might make a good match there.
Oh.
But perhaps she wouldn't mind if you stayed at Plumfield.
While we are gone.
Of course Aunt March prefers Amy over me.
Why shouldn't she?
I'm ugly and awkward, and I always say the wrong things.
I fly around throwing away perfectly good marriage proposals.
I love our home, but I'm just so fitful, and I can't stand being here!
(CRYING) I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Marmee.
(SIGHS) There's just something really wrong with me.
I want to change, but I...
I can't.
And I just know I'll never fit in anywhere.
MARMEE:
Oh, Jo.
Jo, you have so many extraordinary gifts.
How can you expect to lead an ordinary life?
You're ready to go out and find a good use for your talent.
(WHISPERING) Though I don't know what I shall do without my Jo.
Go.
And embrace your liberty.
And see what wonderful things come of it.
(HORSE NEIGHS)
JO:
Laurie sought his refuge in London and abroad.
Marmee helped me find a place in the great city of New York.
And so I stepped over the divide between childhood and all that lay beyond.
Mrs. Kirk?
Josephine!
Oh.
Yes.
How do you do?
Kitty, Minnie!
This is Miss March.
Her father was Colonel March.
He knew your papa.
It was cold!
MRS. KIRK:
Watch your feet, Mr. Costigan.
MAN:
You'll never get it straight.
Do come in, my dear.
JO:
Dear Beth,
Marmee's friend, Mrs. Kirk, has made me feel quite at home.
My little students, Kitty and Minnie, are dear girls.
(MEN LAUGHING)
How curious to grow up in a busy boardinghouse with no father, and your own mother the innkeeper.
I felt bold on leaving Concord.
But I confess I find New York rough and strange, and myself strange in it.
Please pass these down the table.
Thank you kindly, Professor.
JO:
Mrs. Kirk believes that I am here for a brief interlude of sensational experience before succumbing to a matrimonial fate.
Excuse me, miss.
JO:
And while there's surely no lack of sensational experience of every kind available in such a city,
MAN:
Come in!
I hope, though I've had no luck yet, that any experience I gain here will be strictly literary.
And that all events of a romantic or sensational nature will be entirely confined to the page.
Our subscribers are not interested in sentiment and fairy stories, miss.
They're not fairy stories.
Try one of the ladies' magazines.
BOY:
Come on, Will.
Hurry up!
WILL:
I'm coming!
Oh!
Oh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so clumsy.
Oh, no.
No.
FRIEDRICH:
You know that when first I saw you I thought,
"Ah, she is a writer."
What made you think so?
(GIGGLES) Oh!
Yes, I know many writers.
Ah, in Berlin I was...
I was professor at the university.
Here I am just a humble tutor, I'm afraid.
No, please.
Sit down.
Thank you.
You are far from home, Miss March.
Do you miss your family?
Oh, very much.
My sisters especially, and Laurie.
She is your sister?
No, no.
He's a friend.
Whew.
Do you like your coffee?
Oh, it's...
Just very, very strong.
I like it.
You have quite a library.
Did you bring all these books from Germany?
A few of them.
May I?
Of course.
Most of these I could not bear to leave behind.
I sold everything I owned to get my passage to come here, but my books...
Never.
Oh.
Shakespeare.
Some books are so...
Familiar.
Reading them is like being home again.
Will you be returning to Berlin, Professor Bhaer?
Friedrich.
Call me Friedrich.
Friedrich.
No.
Uh, sadly...
The fatherland of Goethe and Schiller is no more.
I adore Goethe.
My father used to read me all the German poets when I was a child.
Really?
That is most surprising.
Well, my mother and father were part of...
A rather unusual circle in Concord.
Do you know the word "transcendentalist"?
But this is German romantic philosophy!
We throw off all our constraints and come to know ourselves through insight and experience.
But it got out of fashion now.
Not in the March family, I'm afraid.
It's just that with all this transcendence comes much emphasis on perfecting oneself.
Ah!
This gives you a problem?
(SIGHS) I'm hopelessly flawed.
If only we could transcend ourselves without perfection, like your poet, Walt Whitman, who rides up and down the streets of Broadway all day shouting poetry against the roar of the carts.
"Keep your silent woods, O nature.
BOTH TOGETHER:
"Your quiet places
"by the woods." "by the rivers."
By the woods.
Woods.
Yes.
BOTH: "Give me the streets of Manhattan."
I think we are all hopelessly flawed.
JO:
He is as poor as one might imagine an itinerant philosopher to be.
Yet, as the weeks go by I see that he is unfailingly generous to all of us who live in the house.
I am grateful to have a friend.
(CHILDREN SCREAMING)
(LAUGHING)
MAN:
That's the system our nation was founded on.
Come now!
It was nothing short of a betrayal of our country's ideals.
Our country's ideals?
A constitution that denies the basic rights of citizenship to women and black people?
They just passed the 15th Amendment, Jacob.
They can vote.
JACOB:
Black men can vote, Charles.
MAN 2:
A lady has no need of suffrage if she has a husband.
Wh...
No, no.
You don't take wine?
Only medicinally.
Well, pretend that you've got a cold.
I agree!
But if women are a moral force, shouldn't they have the right to govern, preach, and testify in court?
Whoa, whoa!
What is it, Miss March?
I find it poor logic to say that because women are good, women should vote.
Men do not vote because they are good.
They vote because they are male.
And women should vote, not because they are angels and men are animals, but because we are human beings and citizens of this country.
You should've been a lawyer, Miss March.
I should have been a great many things, Mr. Mayer.
(MAYER CHUCKLING)
(VIOLIN PLAYING)
Friedrich!
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, please.
Please.
Come in.
I have some good news.
A newspaper has published two of my stories, and they wish to see more.
This is wonderful!
Right there.
The Daily Volcano.
"The Sinner's Corpse," By Joseph March.
Hmm.
Lunatics.
Vampires.
This...
This interests you?
Well, people like thrilling stories, Friedrich.
This is what the newspapers want.
Yes.
Yes, I suppose.
I suppose that is true.
Yes.
Well, it'll buy a new coat for Beth, and I'm sure she'll be grateful to have it.
Jo...
(KNOCKS AT DOOR)
Oh.
I...
I do not want to be your teacher.
No, understand me.
I am saying only that you should please yourself.
My opinion is of no importance.
Do you forgive me?
Well, of course.
Can I make a gift?
An experience.
Do you like the opera?
Ah!
Oh, I do!
I mean, I think I do.
We don't seem to get a lot of opera in Concord.
Well, I don't have an opera dress.
You will be perfect.
Where we are sitting we shall not be so, uh...
Formal.

Come, come!
You've been much occupied with business, I am sure.
I'm not pursuing business just now.
Grandfather agreed I should concentrate on my music for a while.
You know Fred Vaughan.
Freddy.
Good day, Laurence.
Yes.
I see you've taken up a passion for art, Freddy.
Aunt March!
You look splendid.
I cannot say the same for you, my boy.
Amy, dear, will you be long?
I must retire.
Yes, Aunt March.
Do come see us.
Are they engaged?
Not yet.
GIRLS:
Hop, hop!
One, two, three, four.
Hop, hop, hop, turn.
Friedrich, how long would it take strychnine to dissolve in brandy?
Oh!
About eight minutes?
And is a dagger worn at the waist, or is that a saber?
I think that in these novels the dagger is usually concealed in the boot.
By a man with a dark moustache.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(THUNDER CRACKING)
Go this way.
(LAUGHING) Oh!
Hurry, hurry.
Ah.
Well.
Oh, Laurie, how lovely!
It isn't what it should be, but you have improved it.
Please don't.
I liked you much better when you were blunt and natural.
It did not serve me well.
I find you changed.
In fact, I despise you.
You laze about spending your family's money, and courting women.
You aren't serious about music.
My compositions are like your paintings.
Mediocre copies of another man's genius.
Then why don't you go to Grandfather in London and make yourself useful?
I should.
Why don't you reform me?
(SNICKERS)
I've someone more practical in mind.
You do not love Fred Vaughan.
Fred Vaughan is stable and well-mannered...
And has $40,000 a year.
I've always known I would not marry a pauper.
I expect a proposal any day.
You'll regret it.
I'll regret it.
I'm reminded of a promise.
Didn't I say I would kiss you before you die?
Do you hear from Jo?
She has befriended a German professor.
(CHUCKLES)
Yes, well, no doubt he's showing her the ways of the world.
I do not wish to be courted by someone who is still in love with my sister.
I'm not in love with Jo.
Then how do you explain your jealousy?
I envy her happiness.
I envy his happiness.
I envy John Brooke for marrying Meg.
I hate Fred Vaughan.
If Beth had a lover, I would despise him too.
Just as you have always known you would never marry a pauper,
I have always known I should be part of the March family.
I do not wish to be loved for my family.
Any more than Fred Vaughan wishes to be loved for his $40,000 a year.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
LAURIE:
My darling Amy, it is you I want, and not your family.
I've gone to London to make myself worthy of you.
Please, do not do anything we shall regret.
WOMAN:
Monsieur Vaughan, mademoiselle.
May I show him in?
Friedrich, did you read it?
Yes.
It's, uh...
Oh, it's well written, Jo.
And the first novel.
What...
What a great accomplishment!
I'm going to be showing it to your publisher friend, Mr. Fields, today.
He liked "The Sinner's Corpse."
What is it?
Mr. Fields is a good man.
He will...
He will give you an honest opinion.
Oh, I see.
What is your honest opinion?
I'm a professor of philosophy, Jo.
I'd really like to know what you think.
You...
You should be writing from...
From life, from the depths of your soul.
There is nothing in here of the woman that I am privileged to know.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Friedrich, this is what I write.

There's nothing suspicious then, I suppose."
I feel stronger with you close by.
I'm gonna get you better yet.
If God wants me with him, there is none who will stop him.
I don't mind.
I was never like the rest of you, making plans about the great things I'd do.
I never saw myself as anything much.
Not a great writer like you.
Oh, Beth.
I'm not a great writer.
But you will be.
Oh, Jo, I've missed you so.
Why does everyone want to go away?
I love being home.
But I don't like being left behind.
Now I am the one going ahead.
I am not afraid.

During the next few minutes, the rumor circulated that Amy March had got 24 delicious limes.
MEG'S VOICE:
I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you that they powdered and squeezed, and made me look a fashion plate.
JO'S VOICE:
As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet.

Do you mind at all?
Oh.
Oh, no.
I was surprised.
Mind you, I had it on good authority that our Teddy would never love another, and now he's gone and gotten married.
It's good to hear you call me Teddy again.
At last we're all family as we always should have been.
You must promise me that you will always live close by.
I couldn't bear losing another sister.
AMY:
Jo, it's so gloomy and chilly.
One would require an income just for the coal to heat this place.
What could the dear girl have been thinking?
JO:
Most likely she felt sorry for me.
(SPEAKING GRUFFLY) Decrepit homeless spinster!
Jo.
Oh, poor Aunt, living here all those years alone in this useless old house.
Yes, her blessings became a burden because she couldn't share them.
Wouldn't this have made a wonderful school?
A school.
What a challenge that would be!
(DOG BARKING)
Hello, Tuppy.
Hello.
Good boy.
My book!
Someone's publishing my book!
Hannah!
Hannah!
Someone's publishing my book!
Heaven help us!
It came with no letter.
How did it arrive?
Foreign gentleman brung it.
Strange kind of name.
Can't think of it.
Hannah!
Oh, fox or bear or such.
Bhaer!
Did you ask him to wait?
I thought he was one of Miss Amy's European friends coming with a wedding gift.
I said, "Miss March and Mr. Laurie are living next door."
Hannah, you didn't!
And he said he had a train to catch.
Friedrich!
(THUNDER CRACKING)
Oh, Friedrich, thank you for my book.
Well, when I didn't hear from you, I thought you hated it.
Oh, no. no.
Reading your book was like...
Opening a window into your heart.
James Fields took it out of my hands, and he would not give it back to me.
I said, "Such news I have to give to her myself."
Well, it was...
It was a silly impulse.
No, no.
Not silly at all.
It's so good to see you.
Come and meet my family.
(THUNDER RUMBLING) No, I...
Thank you, but, uh...
I have to catch a train.
I...
I'm going to the West.
My ship leaves from Boston tomorrow morning.
Oh.
Yes.
The, uh, schools in the west are young.
They need professors, and, uh, they're not so concerned about the accent.
I don't mind it either.
You see, my, my aunt left me Plumfield.
It isn't a field.
It's a house, actually.
A rather large house.
And it isn't really good for anything except a school.
And I want a good school, one that would be open to anyone who wanted to learn.
Well, I'll be needing someone who knows how to teach.
Is there nothing I might say to keep you here?
I confess that...
I was hoping that I might have a reason to stay, but congratulations on the celebration of your marriage.
Oh, no!
No!
No, that's...
That's Amy.
She's my sister Amy, and Laurie, actually.
No, I'm...
I'm not married.
Please don't go so far away.
Jo.
Such a little name for...
Such a person.
Will you have me?
With all of my heart.
But I have nothing to give you.
My hands are empty.
Not empty now.
My sisters and I remembered that winter as our childhood's coldest.
A temporary poverty had hit our family some years before.
The war made fuel and lamp oil scarce.
The war made fuel and lamp oil scarce.
But necessity is the mother of invention.
Somehow in that dark time, the March family created its own light.
Marmee's home!
We've expectorated you for hours!
- "Expected", featherhead !
- Marmee, you're frozen.
- So many people at Hope House!
- You finished the bundles?
So many this year!
We handed out ...
How's your cold?
We gave them out as fast as we made them.
Now, Miss Amy, what's in my pocket?
Father!
"Dearest family.
I am well and safe."
"Our battalion is encamped on the Potomac."
"December is cold for us, so far from home."
"I think of my girls day and night.
It comforts me."
"I pray your own hardships may not be too great.
Give them my love."
"Tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night."
I'm a selfish girl.
It's Christmas Eve.
Father wouldn't want us to be sad.
To bed, Miss Amy.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- I love you.
- My Jo ...
MerryChristmas.
- Merry Christmas, Marmee.
- Don't sit up too late.
- I won't.
At night, my mind came alive with voices and friends as dear to me as my real ones.
I gave myself up to it, longing for transformation.
What miraculous food !
Isn't this just like the old days, Hannah?
- We should just look at it!
- Jo, come down.
I'm awake!
Horrible piano ...
- Hannah's made a Christmas miracle.
- Is that sausage?
Wait!
Butter!
Isn't butter divinity?
God, thank you for this breakfast.
Fetch Marmee.
She went out at dawn to see some Germans.
"Hummel," the boy said.
No English.
His dad's gone.
Six children, and another coming.
May as well take them firewood, they haven't any.
Or breakfast.
We could send the Hummels our bread.
And the butter, too.
It's not much use without bread.
- Wonderful snow!
- Wouldn't you like to roll in it?
Once one of our finest families.
- Lovely weather for a picnic.
- Come on, Theodore.
We'll be late.
Jo, let them speak first.
What Will they think of us?
Don't look back!
"Knights and ladies, monks and flowergirls, all mingled in the dance."
"Pauline cried out as the groom's mask fell."
"It was not her lover Ferdinand, but his sworn enemy Count Antonio."
"Revenge is mine," quoth he.
- "Continued in the next edition."
- Excellent, Mr. Snodgrass!
- I love forbidden marriages!
- You ought to publish it, Jo.
What's wrong with our newspaper, Mr. Tupman?
"One periwink ...
Advertisement."
"One periwinkle sash has been abscondated from the wash line."
"A gentleman desires any reports leading to its recovery."
Gentlemen of the press:
Hear, hear!
"I call your attention to Mr. Tupman's History of the Squash."
- This is a recipe, Beth !
- I never know what to write.
The first rule of writing is, never write what you know.
What do you think of the boy?
Is he a captive like Smee in "Nicholas Nickleby"?
He looks lonely.
Maybe he has a secret.
A tragic, European secret.
He was reared in Italy among artists and vagrants.
He has a noble brow.
If I was a boy, I'd like to look like that.
Imagine giving up Italy to come and live with that awful old man.
I'd be terrified to live with him.
I'd like to live in such a fine house with nice things.
It doesn't seem like Christmas without presents.
I'm desperate for drawing pencils.
I wish I didn't have to work for Great-Aunt March.
What's your Christmas wish, Beth?
I'd like the war to end, so Father can come home.
- Sweet Beth !
We all want that.
- They have a beautiful piano.
When I'm a writer, I'll buy you the best piano ever.
Or else you can play on mine.
When I marry, I'll be disgustingly rich.
What if the man you love is poor but good, like Father?
It's not like being stuck with a dreadful nose.
One can choose.
I wouldn't marry for money.
What if his business goes bust?
The Eagle pays five dollars a story.
I have ten in my head right now.
Gentlemen !
I dislike all this money talk.
If lack of attention to finance is refinement, then the Marches are the most elegant family in Concord.
We'll all grow up one day, Meg.
We might as well know what we want.
That'll do.
- Put the carriage away.
Quickly!
- Merry Christmas.
I have a wonderful feeling.
Tell me all about Belle Gardiner.
About her nose and her ring.
Annie says it's an emerald.
Everyone's lucky but me!
I'm glad I don't have to go and be with all those frightening people.
Jo, don't eat much at supper, and don't shake hands ...
Yourdress!
You stand too close to the fire.
Just keep your back to the wall.
- What cunning little heels!
- They're rather small.
It's only one night.
Will anyone notice they're from the rag bag?
You have to have heels.
What's that strange smell?
Like burnt feathers ...
- Heavens above!
- You've ruined me!
You shouldn't have had me do it.
I spoil everything.
- I can't go out like this.
- Good.
I'm not going either.
We'll place my bow in front.
Yes, that covers it.
I'll never have suitors.
I'll be an old spinster.
You don't need scores of suitors, only one.
The right one.
- Listen to the child !
- Meg won't be married right away.
With Jo's help, I never will.
- You must be so happy!
- It's enchanting.
I'd best go help Mama.
Excuse me.
- Jehosephat!
I'm sorry.
- Stay!
It's a good hiding place.
I feel awkward just standing and staring at people.
should I put on my jacket?
I don't know the rules.
I'm Laurie.
Theodore Laurence ... calledLaurie.
Jo March.
So, who were you staring at?
- At you.
What game was that?
- I don't know, but I think I won.
Who else?
I was quite taken with ... thatone.
That's Meg.
That's my sister.
She's completely bald in front.
Is it true you lived in Italy among artists and vagrants?
My mother was Italian.
A pianist.
- Grandfather disapproved of her.
- I saw a play like that.
Do you like the theatre?
Were you born there?
- Where . .?
In Italy.
- Do you speak French or Italian?
English at home.
Francais a l'ecole.
Music Conservatory, but Grandfather got me a tutor.
He insists I go to college.
I'd commit murder to go to college!
Actually, I'm going to Europe.
At least, I hope I am.
My great-aunt says she'll go soon.
I work as her companion.
I have to read to her for hours.
But I do all the voices.
Were I not going to be a writer, I'd go to New York and pursue the stage.
- Are you shocked?
- Very!
Sorry!
Meg makes me take the gentleman's part.
A shame you don't know the lady's part!
Are you looking at the back of my dress?
You promised you wouldn't look!
- I've sprained my ankle.
- It's the shoes.
Does it hurt?
- No!
I'm quite well.
- This is our neighbour Laurie.
- I'll get Mrs. Gardiner.
- No, she'll think it's the punch.
- A perfectly good party ruined.
- Let me take you home.
Thank you !
Here, lean on me.
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.
- Bye, Laurie!
- Wherever did you get this shoe?
Did you ride in his carriage?
You're so lucky.
Is he very romantic?
- Not in the slightest.
- He's a dreadful boy.
He was wise to use snow.
He put snow on her ankle?
With his own hands?
- Stop being so swoony.
- You mustn't be silly about boys.
- Does this hurt?
- Everything lovely happens to Meg.
Don't be soppy about Laurie.
I hope we'll be good friends.
- With a boy?
- He isn't a boy.
He's Laurie.
Faster!
Faster!
The young ladies are unusually active, if I may say so.
girls need exertion just like boys.
Feminine weakness is the result of keeping them at home, bent over needlework, in restrictive corsets.
Marmee!
Your young student is an athlete.
He is, thank you.
A good one.
But he's an unruly scholar.
I regret that his grandfather is away much.
One hopes that your girls Will be a gentling influence.
Must you speak to everyone about corsets?
Do I?
Blast these wretched skirts!
- Don't say "blast".
- Amy, don't be such a ninny-pinny.
I wish I was Beth, so I could stay home.
If you like laundry and housework!
- Blast!
- Amy, hurry.
I'll be late for work.
There's Mrs. King.
I'm tardy again.
- Lovely children !
- Meg, must I go to school?
I'm so degradetated.
I owe at least a dozen limes.
- Are limes the fashion?
- It's nothing but limes now.
Everyone keeps them in their desks and trades them for beads.
If you don't bring limes, you're nothing.
I can't pay anyone back.
No wonder you don't learn anything.
I know how it feels to do without luxuries.
We're not destitute yet.
Here's a quarter.
Marmee gave me the rag money this month.
"Secondly, the immortality of the soul is asserted to be in consequence of its immateriality, as in all leipothymic cases consistent with the idea of immortality."
"And immorality and physicality ... "
... andIthink you finally dozed off.
Josephine!
There's a draught!
Is it Father?
Teacher struck me.
He put the limes out into the snow.
May Chester said my limes were for the homeless.
So I said she wouldn't get any from me.
So she told Mr. Davis they were in my desk, and he struck me.
- I'll beat the tar out of him !
- Jo, we must not embrace violence.
- I Will write him a letter.
- That'll show him.
You didn't say they were forbidden.
A month's rag money!
- I shouldn't have given it to you.
- I'm sorry.
All those lovely limes.
- I'm perfectly desolated.
- It's a frivolous concern.
You're more concerned with your nose than your character.
It's an appalling school.
Your spelling's atrocious.
Mr. Davis said it was as useful to educate a woman as a cat.
I'll strangle Mr. Davis!
"Mr. Davis ...
Whatrighthaveyou to strike a child?"
"In God's eyes we are all children.
If you hit and humiliate a child, the only lesson she Will learn is to hit and humiliate."
Can you discipline yourself to learn at home, as Beth has done?
- I withdraw Amy from your school.
- Serves him right!
Jo Will now supervise your education.
Jo, Tell me what happens next.
After the duke renounces his fortune and saves Lady Zara ...
I don't know.
It's all murder.
The damsel's in distress.
I love your damsels in distress.
Beth, truly, I don't know if I could ever be good like Marmee.
I rather crave violence.
If only I could be like Father, and go to war and fight injustice.
- So Marmee does, in her own way.
- Yes ...
I want to do something different.
I don't know what, I'm on the watch.
You'll find it, Jo.
Jo!
Come over here!
You too, Meg !
It's dead as tombs around here.
One doesn't shout at ladies like cattle.
My apologies!
What do those girls do all day?
Over the mysteries of female life is drawn a veil best left undisturbed.
"Dear Countess, pray for me, for I have sinned against myself and my brother Roderigo."
You've got to say "sinned" as if you've really sinned.
Roderigo:
You arrive, seeking the Duke of Lancashire.
Hark, ye!
Who goes there?
I forgot the cymbals.
It's Roderigo!
I want to be Lady Violet.
I'm exhaustified of being the boy.
"The play's the thing," Amy.
You're too little to be Lady Violet.
- Be the Countess de Montanescu.
- You've no lines.
Besides, who'd be Roderigo?
Gentlemen ...
I propose a new member for our theatrical society:
Theodore Laurence.
- He'll laugh at us.
- He'll think it's only a game.
- He won't.
I promise.
- We'd have to guard our conduct.
We bare our souls and Tell secrets.
- He would find us improper.
- Teddy would certainly not!
Please!
Let's try him, shall we?
- Traitor!
- Artists!
May I present myself ...
... asan actor,musician, and a loyal and humble servant of the club.
In token of my gratitude and to promote communication, shouting from the windows being forbidden, I shall provide a post office in our hedge.
To further encourage the baring of our souls and the Telling of our secrets.
I do pledge never to reveal what I hear in confidence here.
well then ...
- Do take your place, Roderigo.
- Sir Roderigo.
So Laurie was admitted into our society.
And we enjoyed the daily novelty of having our own real brother.
- I want to go to the theatre!
- No.
Where are the opera glasses?
You're just hogging Laurie.
Please, can't I go?
Laurie only reserved four seats.
Do I look shabby?
It's not a coronation, just Laurie and that awful Mr. Brooke.
- Ask him for another ticket.
- No.
- You've a cold.
Rest your eyes.
- We'll make ginger tea.
You're weeks behind in algebra.
I won't have an ignorant sister.
Don't sulk, you look like a pigeon.
You'll be sorry, Jo March !
Thank you.
Mrs. Neil Watson, wasn't she a wonderful swooner?
- If only I were the swooning type.
- And I the catching type!
Young Laurence says you are an aficionado of the theatre.
I enjoy reading plays.
Yes, I find it most pleasurable myself.
But I am distracted at the theatre, thinking of actors' peculiar lives.
With such immodestles, one wonders what sort of lady wants such a life.
Meg is a sensational actress.
We put on wild theatricals.
It's just something that we play at.
well, as a matter of fact, at school ...
What do you think of that?
Let's see what they do!
I had a wonderful time, Mr. Brooke.
It was a most delightful evening.
- Thank you very much.
Goodnight!
- Goodnight!
- That was rude.
- You plastered yourself on him.
- It's proper to take a man's arm.
- How was the theatre?
It was wonderful.
I was absolutely inspired by the love scene.
You look flushed.
Was the theatre overcrowded?
Still sulking?
Where did I put my manuscript?
I didn't do it!
I'm going to kill you !
Jehosephat!
How could you do this to me?
Jo, stop it!
You're hurting her.
- Let her go.
What's happened?
- I hate you !
Don't touch it, just let it go.
You're dead !
You're nothing !
I never want to see you again !
It's a great loss.
You have every right to be put out.
But don't let the sun go down on your anger.
Forgive each other.
- Begin again tomorrow.
- I'll never forgive her.
I'm sorry, Jo.
Looks like the last ice this year.
- Say "go".
- Wait for me.
Ignore her.
Ready ...
Blast!
Amy!
Hold on !
Hold on, Amy!
Get a rail !
Grab it, Amy!
Hold on !
There we go.
That's it, that's it.
Josephine March, you walked from Walden Pond in just bloomers?
- As if she noticed !
Dear Amy.
- How could I be so horrible?
- Thank God for Laurie.
- Do you love him more than me?
Don't be a beetle!
I could never love anyone as I love my sisters.
You left out the part where Lady Zara succumbs to the duke's rival.
Right!
Sir Hugo ...
I quite prefer him myself.
ln the spring, we prepared for Meg to go to Sally Moffat's coming-out.
Myself, I'd sooner be hung than attend a fancy ball.
Wait until all Boston sees you !
I told Laurie to keep you from being a wallflower upon penalty of death.
Where is that miserable glove?
Abigail, I shake my head at how you're managing Margaret.
How is she to be married without a proper d?
ut?
Things Will not change with your husband's return.
My nephew is as foolish with money as with his new philosophies.
The one hope for your family is for Margaret to marry well.
Though I don't know who marries governesses.
And this one is entirely ruined with books.
Are those for me?
They're for Meg to take with her.
Marmee, she's lost a glove!
She can't go without gloves.
They're society.
You're right.
She may borrow mine.
- Meg !
You can take Marmee's!
- Oh, dear ...
- More tea?
- No thank you !
Sally Moffat, you won't be able to draw your laces.
At my coming-out, I didn't eat for weeks.
- I do like that colour on you.
- It's just like forget-me-nots.
I haven't seen such fabric for years.
- But you had it made up so plain.
- well, I do my own sewing, and ...
Mrs. Finster has silk pieces ready-made.
I'll take you there.
The Marches don't buy silk.
They have views on slavery.
Didn't your father's school close when he admitted a dark girl?
Mrs Finster's silk isn't from the South.
It's from Linfield.
- This isn't China silk?
- The silk mills use child labour.
"The poor are always with us." You're so good to remind us.
May I Tell you something?
This is an afternoon dress.
I'll make you my pet.
Hortense, viens ici.
Tonight, Miss March shall have many conquests.
You have no corset!
The next dance is the polka.
With me.
I would dance with you, but I fear for my new slippers.
My credo is:
Don't tread on me!
Miss March ...
I thoughtyourfamily were temperance people?
Don't cover up.
Maybe someone hasn't seen all your charms.
And I promised Jo I'd show you off.
- The girls dressed me.
I like it.
- It reveals a whole new Meg.
What do you call this?
Meg ...
I'm sorry.
Please don't Tell Jo how I've behaved.
If you won't Tell about me.
I just wanted to see how it felt to be Belle Gardiner.
- Ail those proposals and gloves.
- You're worth ten of those girls.
Have you seen the way the March girl went after the Laurence heir?
This ridiculous dress!
I keep tripping over it.
tle some of it around your neck, where it can do some good.
I don't like people speculating about Laurie and Meg.
Nothing provokes speculation like a woman enjoying herself.
- Why may Laurie flirt and drink?
- And no one thinks less of him?
For one practical reason:
Laurie is a man.
So he may vote, hold property and pursue any profession.
And so he is not so easily demeaned.
- Who cares what people think?
- I do.
It's nice to be praised and admired.
I couldn't help but like it.
I only care what you think of yourself.
If you feel your value lies in being decorative, I fear one day you may think that's all you are.
Time erodes beauty, but not the wonderful workings of your mind.
Your humour, your kindness ...
and your moral courage.
These are the things I cherish in you.
I wish it was a just world.
I know you'll make it a better place.
No, I don't want them.
Keep the music too.
You need your books in college.
Here's Dombey and Son.
Honestly, I won't need all of Dickens at Harvard.
No, you'll have more important things to read.
Nothing's going to change, Jo.
- I wish I could go.
- I wish you could, too.
You'll come back knowing things I don't know, and I'll hate you !
As it happens, I already know something you don't know.
About Meg and a certain former tutor, soon to be employed at Laurence and Laurence.
Has Meg mislaid a certain personal article, such as ...
... a glove?
- John Brooke stole your glove!
- What glove?
The white one?
He's had it forever.
He keeps it in his pocket!
- Don't you think he must return it?
- What I think doesn't matter.
A telegram from Washington Hospital.
Your father's been wounded.
- You'll have enough for the month.
- Don't worry.
- Look in on the Hummels for me.
- I will.
Where's Jo?
Battling Aunt March for Marmee's ticket.
- John ...
Mr.Brooke.
- I Will escort your mother.
Cook packed supper, and there's a bottle of spirits for Mr. March.
Mr. Brooke is here.
I'm no longer a tutor.
Mr. Laurence has work for me in Washington.
- We couldn't let you travel alone.
- How kind of you !
- We'll take the six o'clock train?
- Yes, I sent Jo ...
Finally ... 25!
Can Aunt March spare it?
I couldn't bear to ask her ...
- I sold my hair.
- Jo, your one beauty!
- It'll grow back.
- It suits you.
Tell Father that we love him.
Tell him we pray for him.
I shall miss my little women !
Are you thinking about Father?
No, my hair ...
Wait for me!
- Blast!
This stove ...
- We'll eat them anyway.
There's no corn meal or coffee.
We can't get credit.
- What can I bring the Hummels?
- Oh, fry the Hummels!
- The boys are sick.
- I mustn't Tell Marmee.
I hate money!
Your potatoes!
I don't understand.
I brought a ...
- Laurie's home!
- He must need funds.
We'd get a week's food from his billiard money.
Meg, I sold "The Lost Duke of GIoucester"!
Five whole dollars!
- I'm an author ...
Beth?
- The Hummel baby is sick.
I feel so strange.
She's hot, but she feels cold.
She's thirsty, but won't drink.
- Arsenic?
Belladonna?
- I saw the Hummels.
Two children are dead from scarlet fever.
You and Miss Jo have had it.
But, Miss Amy ...
We must send you away.
She won't die, Will she, Laurie?
God won't let her die.
I don't want to go away.
I'll come every day, I swear.
You won't be alone.
I'm afraid of Aunt March.
If she's unkind to you, I'll take come and take you away.
- Where Will we go?
- Paris?
If I die of scarlet fever, give Meg my box with the green doves on it.
- Jo can have my turquoise ring.
- I'll see to it.
I don't want to die.
I've never even been kissed.
I've waited my whole life to be kissed.
What if I miss it?
I'll Tell you what ...
I promise to kiss you before you die.
Marmee mustn't leave Father.
- Beth needs her.
- What if Father gets worse?
And how would we pay for the train?
"That he profane not my sancteraries ... "
- Sanctuaries.
- Sanctuaries.
"For I the Lord do sanctify them."
"And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to all the children of Israel."
Go on.
"And the Lord said to Moses ... "
Jo, Mr. Laurence is here.
If we may, my personal physician Will examine the little girl.
There's nothing to be done.
If I bleed her, it Will finish her.
Best to send for the mother.
I've already done so.
Mrs. March arrives tonight.
Jo!
Cricket, Marmee's here.
Icy cold !
Jo, fetch a basin of vinegar, water, and some rags.
Meg, my kit.
We'll draw the fever down from her head.
Beth ...
And so our Beth came back to us, although fever weakened her heart.
We did not know that a shadow had fallen.
We prepared for another Christmas without Father.
- Try each corner.
- No!
One bow's enough.
- I'm so sorry!
- It happens all the time.
- Here she comes.
- What shall I do with the bows?
The house is beautiful.
Friends of mine from college.
Freddy Vaughan, Averill Watson.
They won't bite.
- No, don't sit there, sit ...
- Here!
- Sit here, child.
Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
I should have given it to you long ago.
It belonged to my little girl.
She left us when she was very young.
But now it Will make music again.
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.
Merry Christmas.
- Play something, Beth.
- shall I?
That was good.
I fear you'll have a long engagement.
John must get a house first and do his service.
John?
Marry?
That pokey old Mr. Brooke?
How did he sneak into this family?
- He visits Father every day.
- He's dull.
Find someone amusing !
He is good, kind and serious.
I'm not afraid of being poor.
You can't just let her go and marry him.
Better to be a poor man's wife than to lose one's self-respect.
- You don't mind that he's poor?
- No.
But I'd rather he had a house.
Why marry?
Why can't things stay as they are?
It's a proposal, nothing need be decided.
Let's not spoil the day.
- Father . .?
Father!
- What a wonderful present!
Beth ...
ThankGodyou 'rewell.
Give him room !
My wild girl !
This could become the fashion.
- Be very careful.
- Don't coddle me too much.
- Hannah ...
It'sgoodtoseeyou.
- It's good to have you home.
Let me look at my girls.
Cholera took more men than the rebs.
Agriculture isn't taught, and it should be.
- What happened with you and John?
- Never you mind.
- Isn't it wonderful, Jo?
- Yes, it's wonderful.
Change comes like the seasons, and twice as quick.
We make our peace with it as best we can.
Or, as Amy once said:
"We'll all grow up someday.
We might as well know what we want. "
But her landscapes lack emotion.
I think she'd benefit from study.
But she won't get it around here.
- What do you suggest?
- Cape Cod?
But Europe is best.
Teddy!
You were supposed to come tonight.
Hail the conquering graduate!
- Is Grandfather proud?
- Yes.
But he wants me in an office.
Why can Amy paint china, and you can scribble, while I set music aside?
Why must you?
If I don't ...
I'd have to defy Grandfather.
Yes, and not the whole of society.
I can't go against the old man.
When I imagine myself in that life -
- I can think of only one thing that would make me happy.
No.
Teddy ... don't.
We have to talk reasonably.
I have loved you since I first saw you.
What is more reasonable than to marry you?
We'd kill each other.
We can't keep our tempers.
- I can ... unlessprovoked.
- We're stubborn and quarrelsome.
You can't even propose without quarrelling.
Jo ... dearJo .
I swear I'll be a saint.
I'll let you win every argument.
I'll take care of you and your family.
I'll give you every luxury.
You need write only if you want to.
Grandfather wants me to learn the business in England.
Can't you see us bashing around London?
I'm not fashionable enough.
You need someone elegant and refined.
I want you.
Teddy, please.
Don't ask me.
I'm desperately sorry.
I do care for you.
You're my dearest friend.
- But I can't go be a wife.
- You say you won't, but ...
- You Will !
- I won't, I won't.
One day ...
... you'llmeetsomeman, and you Will love him tremendously.
And you Will live and die for him.
You Will !
I know you.
And I'll be hanged if I stand by and watch.
Are you ill?
She has refused Laurie.
I'm sure she can take it back.
It's just a misunderstanding.
Listen to him ...
- I must get away.
- Of course.
- Aunt March is going to France.
- France!
That's ideal !
- Aunt March asked me to go.
- To Europe?
My Europe.
- When?
- It was decided just today.
I am her companion now.
She wishes me to study painting and make a good match.
But perhaps she wouldn't mind if you stayed at Plumfield while we're gone.
Of course Aunt March prefers Amy.
I'm ugly and I say the wrong things.
I fly around throwing away good marriage proposals.
I love our home, but I'm so fitful.
I can't stand being here.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Marmee.
There's something wrong with me.
I want to change, but I can't, and I ...
I just know I'll never fit in anywhere.
Jo, you have so many extraordinary gifts.
How can you expect to lead an ordinary life?
You're ready to go out and find a good use for your talents.
Although I don't know what I'll do without my Jo.
Go ... andembraceyourliberty.
And see what wonderful things come of it.
Laurie sought refuge in London and abroad.
Marmee helped me find a place in New York.
So I crossed the line between childhood and what lay beyond.
- Mrs. Kirk?
- Josephine!
- How do you do?
- Kitty, Minnie!
This is Miss March.
Her father, Colonel March, knew your papa.
Watch your feet, Mr. Costigan.
Come in, dear.
Dear Beth, Mrs. Kirk has made me feel quite at home.
My little students, Kitty and Minnie, are dear girls.
How curious to grow up in a boarding-house with no father.
I felt bold leaving, but I confess I find New York rough and strange and myself strange in it.
Mrs. Kirk believes I'm here for an exciting interlude before succumbing to matrimony.
But, while there's no lack of sensational experiences here, -
- I hope that any experience I gain may be strictly literary, and that romantic or sensational events are confined to the page.
Our subscribers do not like sentiment and fairy stories.
- They're not fairy stories.
- Try one of the ladies' magazines.
You know, when first I saw you, I thought:
- "She is a writer."
- What made you think so?
I know many writers.
In Berlin, I was a professor at the university.
Here I'm just a humble tutor, I'm afraid.
No, please, sit down.
You're far from home.
Do you miss your family?
Very much.
My sisters especially.
- And Laurie.
- She's your sister?
No, he's a friend.
- You like your coffee?
- It's very strong ...
I likeit .
You have quite a library.
- Did you bring them from Germany?
- A few.
- May I?
- Of course.
Most of these I could not bear to leave behind.
I sold everything I owned to get my passage.
But my books ...
Never.
Shakespeare ...
Some books are so familiar that it's like being home again.
Will you be returning to Berlin, Professor Bhaer?
Friedrich.
Call me Friedrich.
No.
Sadly, the fatherland of Goethe and Schiller is no more.
I adore Goethe.
My father used to read me all the German poets.
My mother and father were part of a rather unusual circle in Concord.
- Do you know "transcendentalism"?
- It's German romantic philosophy.
We throw off constraints and come to know ourselves through insight.
- It's out of fashion now.
- Not in the March family.
But with this transcendence comes much emphasis on perfecting oneself.
- This gives you a problem?
- I'm hopelessly flawed.
If only we could transcend ourselves without perfection.
Like Whitman, who shouts poetry on the street to the roar of the carts.
"Keep your silent woods, oh nature, and your quiet places by the woods."
"Give me the streets of Manhattan."
I think we are all hopelessly flawed.
He is poor, as one expects of an itinerant philosopher.
Yet I see he is unfailingly generous to all of us.
I am grateful to have a friend.
- Our nation was founded on it.
- It was a betrayal of our ideals.
A constitution that denies basic rights to women and black people?
They've passed the 1 5th amendment.
They can vote.
- Black men can vote.
- A lady has no need of suffrage.
- I take wine only medicinally.
- Pretend you've got a cold.
If women are a moral force, can't they govern, preach and testify?
What is it, Miss March?
It's poor logic to say that because women are good they may vote.
Men do not vote because they are good.
Women should vote, not because they are good, but because they are human beings.
- You should have been a lawyer.
- I should have been many things.
- Friedrich?
Oh, I'm sorry ...
- No, please.
Come in.
A newspaper published two of my stories, and they want more.
This is wonderful !
"The Daily Volcano"?
"The Sinner's Corpse" ...
by Joseph March.
Lunatics ... vampires...
This interests you?
people like thrilling stories.
This is what the newspapers want.
Yes ...
I suppose that is true.
It Will buy a new coat for Beth.
She'll be grateful for it.
I do not want to be your teacher.
No, understand me ...
I am saying only that you should please yourself.
My opinion is of no importance.
- Do you forgive me?
- Of course.
Can I make a gift?
Do you like the opera?
I do!
I mean, I think I do.
We don't get much opera in Concord.
- I have no opera dress.
- You Will be perfect.
Where we are sitting, we shall not be so formal.
Leila is a goddess.
She has promised never to love.
If she breaks her vow, all Will be lost.
- Look, trouble is coming.
- What Will happen?
The inevitable.
Leila's soul is opening.
She is drawn to an idea.
He says, "Love has a fatal power."
"Your heart understood mine."
"In the depth of the fragrant night, -
- I listened with ravished soul to your beloved voice."
"Your heart understood mine."
Laurie!
You wicked ...
We heard you were in Greece.
- You are occupied with business?
- Not just now.
Grandfather agreed I should concentrate on music.
- You know Fred Vaughan.
- Good day, Laurence.
I see you're studying art.
Aunt March, you look splendid.
I cannot say the same for you, my boy.
Amy, Will you be long?
I must retire.
Do come and see us.
- Are they engaged?
- Not yet.
How long would strychnine take to dissolve in brandy?
Eight minutes?
And is a dagger worn at the waist, or is that a sabre?
In these novels, the dagger is usually concealed in the boot.
By a man with a dark moustache.
Oh Laurie, how lovely!
It isn't what it should be, but you improve it.
Don't.
I liked you better when you were blunt and natural.
It did not serve me well.
I find you changed.
I despise you.
You laze about, spending money and courting women.
- You aren't serious about music.
- My music is like your paintings.
Mediocre copies of another man's genius.
Then why not go to Grandfather and make yourself useful?
I should.
Why don't you reform me?
- I've someone else in mind.
- You do not love Fred Vaughan.
- He's stable and well-mannered ...
- And has 40,000 a year.
I've always known I would not marry a pauper.
- I expect a proposal any day.
- You'll regret it.
I'll regret it.
I'm reminded of a promise.
Didn't I say I would kiss you before you die?
Do you hear from Jo?
She has befriended a German professor.
No doubt he's showing her the ways of the world.
I Will not be courted by someone who is stiil in love with my sister.
- I'm not in love with Jo.
- Then why are you jealous?
I envy her happiness.
I envy his happiness.
I envy John Brooke for marrying Meg.
I hate Fred Vaughan.
If Beth had a lover I'd despise him.
Just as you knew you would never marry a pauper, -
- I have always known I should be part of the March family.
I do not wish to be loved for my family.
Any more than Fred Vaughan wishes to be loved for his 40,000 a year.
My darling Amy, it is you I want, not your family.
I have gone to London to make myself worthy of you.
Please, do not do anything we shall regret.
Monsieur Vaughan, Mademoiselle.
May I show him in?
- Friedrich !
Did you read it?
- Yes ...
It's well written, Jo.
The first novel.
What a great accomplishment!
I'll show it to the publisher you know.
He liked "Sinner's Corpse".
What is it?
Mr. Fields is a good man.
He Will give you an honest opinion.
I see ...
What's your honest opinion?
- I'm a professor of philosophy, Jo.
- I'd like to know.
You should be writing from life.
From the depths of your soul.
There is nothing here of the woman I am privileged to know.
Friedrich, this is what I write.
I'm sorry it doesn't live up to your standards.
There is more to you than this, if you have the courage to write it.
Meg !
Jo?
- Why didn't you Tell me?
- One hardly speaks of such things.
How wonderful.
- How is Beth?
- You Will find her much altered.
Marmee ...
We couldn't send for you sooner.
The doctor's been many times, but it's beyond all of us.
I think she's been waiting for you, before ...
Drink up all this good broth.
- I'm glad you're home.
- So am I .
"Mr. Pickwick changed colour."
"well, that's important.
There's nothing more suspicious, then."
I feel stronger with you close by.
We'll get you better yet.
If God wants me with him, there is none who Will stop him.
I don't mind.
I was never like the rest of you ...
making plans to do great things.
I never saw myself as anything much.
I'm not a great writer, like you.
- Beth, I'm not a great writer.
- But you Will be.
Oh Jo, I've missed you so.
Why does everyone want to go away?
I love being home.
But I don't like being left behind.
Now I'm the one going ahead.
I am not afraid.
I can be brave like you.
But I know I shall be homesick for you.
Even in heaven.
I won't let you go.
"Aunt March is bedridden, and would not survive the voyage."
"Amy must bide her time and return later."
It's just as well.
Will we never all be together again?
Lovely morning.
Thank you, sir.
Dearest Laurie.
You have not heard our sad news of Beth. "
"Meg has entered her confinement, and Amy must stay with Aunt March."
"This is far too great a sorrow to bear alone. "
"Please come home, Teddy dear.
Your faithful Jo. "
Laurie ...
I knew you would come.
The real charm was Beth's happy face at the new piano as she lovingly touched the beautiful keys.
The rumour spread that Amy March had 24 delicious limes.
I said they dressed me up, but not that they made me a fashion plate.
As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet.
An outcry arose.
Her abundant hair was cut short.
Jo, how could you?
Your one beauty.
Nothing's going to change, Jo.
Surprise!
You have a daughter.
And a son.
I can't believe you did this four times.
Yes, but never two at once, my darling.
Daisy ...
Meg, she's so beautiful.
And him !
He's handsome.
He'll look just like his papa.
He does look like John.
- Have you heard from the professor?
- No.
We did not part well.
John and I don't always agree, but then we mend it.
Who could that be?
- Teddy!
This is magic!
- You are absolutely ...
... coveredin flour!
Come in !
Not yet.
May I Tell you something, alone?
I'm glad you're the first to know.
May I present ...
... mywife.
Brussels lace!
I went to paint the great cathedrals but I couldn't forget our home.
Look how Amy has captured Orchard House.
It's beautiful !
Not as beautiful as I wanted, but I am still learning.
Dear little angel.
Jo, Tell me the truth, as a sister, which is a relationship stronger than marriage ...
- Do you mind at all?
- Oh, no.
I was surprised.
I was told that Teddy would never love another, and now he's married.
It's good to hear you call me "Teddy" again.
At last we're all family, as we always should have been.
Promise to live close by.
I couldn't bear losing another sister.
Jo, it's so gloomy and chilly.
It would take an income just for the coal.
What was she thinking?
Most likely she felt sorry for me.
"Decrepit homeless spinster".
Poor Aunt.
Living all those years alone in this ... uselessoldhouse.
Yes, her blessings became a burden.
Wouldn't this be a wonderful school?
What a challenge that would be!
Hello, Tuppy.
My book!
Someone's publishing my book!
Hannah !
Someone's publishing my book.
How did it arrive?
A foreign gentleman brought it.
Strange kind of name ...
- "Fox" or "Bear" ...
- Did you ask him to wait?
I thought it was one of Miss Amy's European friends ...
I said Miss March and Mr. Laurie lived next door.
He said he had a train to catch.
Friedrich !
Thank you for my book.
When I didn't hear from you I thought you hated it.
Reading it was like opening a window to your heart.
James Fields took it and would not give it back.
I said, "Such news I have to give to her myself."
- well, it was a silly impulse.
- No, not silly at all.
It's so good to see you.
Come and meet my family.
Thank you, but I have to catch a train.
I'm going to the West.
My ship leaves from Boston tomorrow.
The schools in the West are young.
They need professors, and ...
... they'renotconcerned about the accent.
I don't mind it, either.
My aunt left me Plumfield.
It isn't a field.
It's a rather large house.
All it's good for is a school.
And I want a good school.
One that's open to anyone who wants to learn.
I'll be needing someone who knows how to teach.
- Could I not persuade you to stay?
- I confess ...
I was hoping I might have a reason to stay, but ...
Congratulations on your marriage.
Oh, no!
That's Amy.
My sister, Amy, and Laurie.
I'm not married.
- Please don't go so far away.
- Jo ...
Such a little name for ...
such a person.
Will you have me?
With all of my heart.
But I have nothing to give you.
My hands are empty.
They're not empty now.
- So you're going to Washington?
- Yes, ma'am.
My son is sick in a hospital there.
This will be an anxious Christmas for you.
I think this one will do.
Let's try this.
- Is it your only son?
- No, ma'am.
I had four, but two were killed and one is a prisoner.
You've done a great deal for your country, sir.
Not a mite more than I ought, ma'am.
I'd go myself if I was any use.
Thank you for the overcoat.
Wait a minute.
I hope you find him better.
Thank you, ma'am.
God bless you.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Mrs. March, will you sign this so I can get it off?
Why, what's the matter?
When I see things like that poor old man it makes me ashamed to think how little I do.
But, my dear, you're doing all you can here, and your husband is there.
Yes, I know.
His last son is lying ill, miles away waiting to say goodbye to him, forever perhaps while I have my four girls to comfort me.
And a real comfort they are, too, aren't they?
I couldn't bear it without them.
- Meg and Jo are working, you know?
- Yes?
Meg is a nursery governess.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Remember, Lily, Santa Claus is watching you.
Come on, Tony.
"We know as well, what are the baneful fruits of selfishness...
"...and self-indulgence.
Bad habits take root with fearful rapidity...
"...even in the richest natures.
"They grow...
"...and ripen and bear their fruit...
"...
like southern vines and weeds...
"...almost...
"...in a single day and night.
"Crush them, pluck them out pitilessly from their very first appearance...
"...and do not weary...
"...of the labor of plucking them out...
"...again and again."
Goodbye, goodbye!
Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!
Go on, Josephine.
Josephine!
Where are you off to, Miss?
I didn't think you'd mind.
It was nearly time to leave and the girls said they'd be home early so we could rehearse my play for Christmas.
Never a thought about my Christmas.
Flying off without a word of cheer or greeting for your poor old aunt.
I'm sorry, Aunt March.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Here.
It's a dollar for each.
Well, take them.
Thank you, Aunty.
Never mind thanking me.
Just spend it wisely, that's all I ask.
Although it's more than I can expect when you're so much like your father waltzing off to war and letting other folks look after his family.
There's nobody looking after us.
And we don't ask favors from anybody.
I'm very proud of Father and you should be, too.
- Don't you be impertinent, Miss.
- I'm sorry, Aunty.
It isn't preachers that are going to win this war.
It's fighters!
Yes, Aunty.
- Can I go, now?
- Yeah, go on.
- Did you clean Polly's cage today?
- Yes, Aunty.
Did you wash those teacups and put them away carefully?
Yes, Aunty.
- You didn't break any?
- No, Aunty.
- What about the teaspoons?
- I polished them.
Yes.
Very well then.
Wait, just a minute.
Come back here.
Look at this.
You haven't dusted properly.
I want this stair rail dusted and polished before you leave here.
Yes, Aunty.
Higher.
Thank you very much, ladies.
And now I wish you all a very merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas!
School is dismissed.
Amy March!
You may close the door.
That'll teach her not to cut up didoes.
- It serves that stuck-up Amy March right.
- What's he going to do to her?
I can see there's nothing for me to do but to stop by and show your mother how instead of doing your sums, you cover your slate with sketches.
And most uncomplimentary sketches.
Please, Mr. Davis, I'll never do it again, sir.
And she'd be so disappointed in me.
Please.
Please.
Well, I should hate to spoil her Christmas and for that reason alone, young lady, I shall overlook it.
Thank you, Mr. Davis!
You may go.
Thank you, Mr. Davis.
Thank you very much indeed.
Thank you, sir.
Here she is.
- What did he do?
- What did he say?
Come on, tell us.
What happened?
I just said that if I ever told my mother the way he treated me she'd take me out of his old school.
She's never been "reconciliated" anyway since my father lost his money and she's had to suffer the "degaridation" of me being thrown in with a lot of ill-mannered girls who stick their noses in refined people's business.
Little tiny pussy, I'll tell you a long story.
- Hannah, is it teatime?
- Yes.
- I'll set the table.
- Thank you, Beth.
It'll be a help to me 'cause my bread's raised.
The girls are getting home early.
- Are they coming?
- Just passing the Laurence house.
- Christopher Columbus!
- Jo, don't use such dreadful expressions.
Here comes old Mr. Laurence.
What if he heard you?
I don't care.
I like good strong words that mean something.
Oh, bother.
Now we're going to have to speak to him.
How do?
It makes my knees chatter just to look at him.
I feel sorry for that poor boy, shut up alone with such an ogre for a grandfather.
- Look, there he is.
- Where?
Don't point, Jo.
He'll think you're waving at him.
He's gone anyway.
Well, what if he does?
Jo!
Come along, Amy.
- How's my Beth?
- It's cold outside!
Jo just did the most terrible thing.
Beth, come over here.
- He waved at us.
- Is tea ready yet?
Merry Christmas from Aunt March.
- For me?
- Yes, darling, for you.
We got one, too.
- What are you going to do with it, dear?
- I don't know.
Marmee said we ought not to spend money for pleasure when our men are suffering so in the Army.
A dollar couldn't do the Army much good, so I'm going to buy Undine and Sintram.
I've wanted it long enough.
I'm sure Marmee would approve if I got some new gloves.
I've darned my old ones until I can hardly get them on.
She always says a real lady is known by her neat gloves and boots.
I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils.
I really need them.
Then I'd like to spend mine for some new music that is, if you don't think Marmee would mind.
Let's each buy what we want and have a little fun.
I'm sure we work hard enough.
I know I do.
It's not the work I mind so much.
It's having to tell Flo King how pretty she looks in things I know would look as well on me.
What would you do if you were shut up all day with an old crosspatch who flies off the handle every move you make?
Jo, don't use slang.
Besides, don't forget she gave us the dollar.
I'm sure neither of you suffer as I do.
You don't have to go to that nasty old Davis' school with impertinent girls who laugh at you and "label" your father 'cause he isn't rich.
"Libel." Don't say "label" as if Papa were a pickle bottle.
I know what I mean and you needn't be "statirical" about it.
It's proper to use good words and improve your "vocabilary."
Aren't we elegant?
You'd never be thought so with your slang.
I hope not.
I don't want to be elegant.
- You needn't whistle like a boy.
- That's why I do it.
- I detest rude, unladylike girls.
- And I hate affected, niminy-piminy chicks.
Birds in their little nests agree.
Really, you're both to blame.
You're old enough to leave off boyish tricks and behave better, Josephine.
Now you are so tall and turn up your hair, you must remember you're a young lady.
No, I'm not.
And if turning up my hair makes me so, I'll wear it down till I'm 100.
Jo!
As for you, Amy, your absurd words are as bad as Jo's slang.
Your airs are funny now, but you'll grow into an affected goose unless you take care.
If Jo is a tomboy and Amy's a goose, what am I, please?
You're a dear and nothing else.
We're three ungrateful wretches who don't deserve you.
Wait until I become a famous author and make my fortune.
Then we'll all ride in fine carriages, dressed like Flo King snubbing Amy's friends and telling Aunt March to go to the dickens.
Let's rehearse.
We'll start with the fainting scene.
You're as stiff as a poker in that, Amy.
Well, I can't help it.
I've never seen anyone faint and I don't intend to make myself black-and-blue tumbling as flat as you do.
It's easy if you'll only watch me.
Come on.
- Lf I can drop gracefully, I'll...
- Now, when I come in you'll see the horrible look in my eyes and you shrink back trembling.
Go ahead.
Get into the mood, Amy.
Now, when I start toward you, with wicked intentions...
Oh, Amy, you draw back in horror, covering your eyes with your hands.
"Roderigo, Roderigo!
"Save me, save me!"
There, now you see?
Now, it's easy.
Now, here I come.
"Roderigo, Roderigo!
"Save me, save me!"
- You were marvelous.
- That was lovely.
Glad to find you so merry, my girls.
- Darling.
- Marmee.
- How is your cold, Meg?
- Much better.
Beth, dear, kiss me, baby.
Thank you, Jo.
Thank you, dear.
- You look tired to death, Jo.
- No, Marmee, I'm not tired.
- Your slippers are all ready now.
- That's my Bethie, dearie.
Did you have a hard day, Marmee?
No, very pleasant, dear.
But it's good to be home.
- I have a treat for you.
- A letter from Father?
Three cheers for Father.
"Give them all my dear love and a kiss.
"Tell them I know they will remember all I said to them:
"That they will be loving children to you...
"...they will do their duty faithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely...
"...and conquer themselves so beautifully...
"...that when I come back to them, I may be fonder and prouder than ever...
"...of my little women."
I am a selfish girl but I'll truly try to be better and not waste my time in school so that Father may not be disappointed in me.
I'll try and be what he loves to call me, "a little woman" and not be rough and wild, and do my duty here at home instead of always wanting to go to war to help Father.
I'm not going to be envious anymore, if I can help it.
Now, we'll save the rest till after tea for it's such a lovely long letter.
I know everybody must be hungry.
Let's get something for Marmee with our dollar instead of for ourselves, shall we?
That's like you, Beth.
What shall we get?
- I'll get her a nice pair of gloves.
- New slippers, best to be had.
Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed.
A beautiful little bottle of cologne.
She'll like that, and it won't cost much and then I'll have some left over for my pencils.
I've finished with Asia.
And here is Europe.
- Three stitches and you can have Africa.
- Not too long stitches, dear.
If you pass me the scissors, I'll give you America.
There, you see?
You did finish it after all.
You wanted to put it off until tomorrow.
But we never should have if Jo hadn't made a game of it and thought of talking of the different countries as we worked.
It was a nice idea, Jo.
Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrim 's Progress when you were little?
I can see us all now with your ragbags tied over our backs for burdens.
You have real burdens now, instead of ragbags.
According to what I heard before tea, except Beth.
She didn't say.
Maybe she hasn't any.
Yes, I have.
Mine is dishes and dusters and being afraid of people and envying girls with nice pianos.
A piano is a burden.
Good night, my precious.
Good night, Marmee.
- Good night, Jo, my girl.
- Good night, Marmee.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night, my baby.
- Good night, Marmee.
- Good night, Bethie.
- Merry Christmas, Hannah.
- Merry Christmas!
Where's Marmee?
She just went down the street, but she'll be right back.
She wants you to have your breakfast when I can get it dished up.
Come round here.
Hide them.
Get close.
- Where have you been, Amy?
- What have you been doing?
Don't laugh, Jo.
I only changed the little bottle of cologne for a big one.
I gave all my money to get it.
- Amy.
- Darling.
That was unselfish of you.
You're some pumpkins, Amy.
I felt ashamed, thinking only of myself.
Amy, my prettiest rose.
And I'm so glad, because mine is the handsomest now.
- Where is Marmee?
- She'll be back any minute.
Breakfast!
- Hannah, I'm so hungry.
- Hannah, what is it?
Sausages!
Popovers!
They are my favorites!
Coffee!
Oh, Hannah, you've beat the Dutch.
No need to make such a fuss about it.
I remember when I used to serve it on your father's table every day.
No?
- Hannah, were we really that rich?
- How was I dressed?
I'd like to tell Jenny Snow all the pretty clothes I used to wear.
- I can tell her.
Diapers!
- Jo!
Two each.
- Isn't this marvelous?
- Look at all the popovers.
She's coming!
Hurry, Beth, strike up.
Amy, open the door.
Come here, Meg.
We'll cover these up and it'll be a surprise.
Enter, Marmee.
- Merry Christmas, Marmee!
- Merry Christmas, my...
Oh, darling!
Oh, Meg, dear!
Thank you!
And handkerchiefs from Bethie.
Thank you.
Hannah, did you see?
Amy, my precious, thank you!
These are from me.
Jo, my girl.
Thank you, darlings.
Thank you.
Oh, my girls.
I can't tell you how happy I am.
Well, I can tell you how hungry I am.
Come on, everyone.
Pass me those plates.
- Sit down, Marmee.
- Marmee, look!
Sausages.
Wait a minute, girls.
I want to say one word before we begin.
I've just come from a poor woman with a little newborn baby and six children huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have no fire.
They are suffering cold and hunger.
My girls, will you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present?
I'm so glad you came back before we started.
I knew you would.
May I carry some things?
We shall all go.
Take the coffee, Hannah.
- I'll get some firewood.
- I'll take the cream.
I'll take the bread.
I'll take the popovers.
Here we are, Mrs. Hummel.
Gott in Himmel.
Good angels come to us.
Funny angels, in hoods and mittens.
Do you want some bread to eat?
Here, I'll give you some bread.
Strange that Roderigo is not here.
His note says "promptly on the hour."
"And why..."
And why Black Hugo's castle for the tryst?
I am afraid.
Who comes here?
Your Highness, 'tis Mona the hag.
Black Hugo hath betrayed thee.
I must fly.
Zara will be waiting.
My proud beauty!
She will be mine!
Black Hugo approaches.
Withered crone, begone!
Roderigo, Roderigo!
Save me, save me!
And now to carry out my fell design.
What a fake.
Well, I told you I wasn't going to make myself...
Have pity.
Oh, have pity!
Bring not upon me the worst of shame!
Silence, else you'll rue the day you spurned Black Hugo's love.
Make thyself ready for the wedding.
I shall return within the quarter.
Ah, me!
Heaven protect the helpless!
Zara!
My beloved!
Roderigo, durst I believe my eyes?
"The pale stars are twinkling
"The fair moon is rising above
"My guitar is tinkling
"But the notes are not sweet Till they bring me my love"
Courage, my fair.
The good padre waits at yonder gate with the horses.
See, the ladder.
All is arranged.
Liberty!
Fly with me.
Fly with me, my love.
I will assist you.
I will...
It's all right, everyone.
Stay where you are.
Young ladies.
Will you all please come in to supper?
Christopher Columbus!
What's this?
Is it fairies?
- It's Santa Claus?
- Mother did it?
- Aunt March had a good fit and sent it?
- All wrong.
Mr. Laurence sent it.
- No!
- Who is Mr. Laurence?
The Laurence boy's grandfather.
He lives next door.
He heard what you did about your breakfast and sent me a nice note saying he hoped I'd allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children and send them a few trifles in honor of the day.
The boy put it into his head, I know he did.
He looks like a capital fellow and I'm dying to get acquainted.
I'm going to, too.
I wish Father were here.
I'm afraid he isn't having such a merry Christmas as we are.
Hello.
How do you do?
I wanted to thank you.
We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present.
What's the matter?
Are you sick?
Just a little cold, but grandfather's made me stop indoors for a week.
That's too bad.
Can anybody come to see you?
If they would.
Wait, I'll ask Marmee.
Close the window now.
- How do you do, Miss March?
- How do you do, Mr. Laurence?
Mother was so sorry to hear that you'd been ill.
My sister, Meg, sent you some of her blancmange.
It's soft and will slide down easily without hurting your throat.
Thank you.
And Beth lent you these until you're well.
I know boys don't like kittens, but she was so anxious I couldn't refuse.
Maybe they'll help to liven things up.
It's as dull as tombs over here.
Won't you come in?
No, I'm not to stay.
Please.
Just for a few minutes.
I've ordered tea.
Christopher Columbus!
What richness!
It's just like summer!
This is marvelous!
It's so roomy.
How many, please?
Two, please.
Three.
How do you like it here after living in Europe so long, Mr. Laurence?
I'm going to Europe.
- Really?
When?
- I don't know.
My aunt has rheumatism and the doctor thought the baths...
Not that she hasn't a bath.
She has a very nice one.
Did you take any baths while you were there?
- I mean, for rheumatism.
- No, I'm not troubled with rheumatism.
Neither am I. But she thought that baths wouldn't do me any harm.
I mean, that is to say, while I was there.
You see, I've always wanted to go to Europe.
Not for the baths, of course, but for my writing.
You see, my aunt...
But you don't know Aunt March, do you?
Well, never mind.
What were you saying, Mr. Laurence?
I'm not Mr. Laurence.
I'm only Laurie.
Laurie.
How do you like it here after Europe?
It's strange after living in schools all my life but it will be all right when I get used to Grandfather.
You know, he...
Yes, you should have seen him before you came.
- Isn't he a holy terror?
- You ought to see Aunt March.
It's too pretty to eat.
I wish we had things like this over here.
And I wish...
It is nice, isn't it?
My little sister put on the geranium leaves.
She's very artistic.
- Amy?
- Yes.
How do you know?
I often hear you calling to one another and when I'm alone over here...
I beg your pardon for being so rude but sometimes you forget to put down the curtains and when the lamps are lighted, it's like looking at a picture to see you all around the table with your mother.
You always seem to be having such good times.
We'll never draw that curtain anymore.
And I give you leave to look as much as you like.
I wish instead of just peeping, you'd come over and see us.
We'd have jolly times together.
Would you let me be in a play?
I saw some of it the other night.
That was terrible.
I want to put on Hamlet and do the fencing scene.
I could play Laertes.
I took fencing lessons at the academy.
- Really?
- Yes, look.
Look.
En garde!
- Splendid!
- Here.
"Come, for the third, Laertes, you but dally."
"Say you so?
Come on."
- "Another hit; what say you?" - "A touch, a touch, I do confess."
What is this?
What on earth?
What's going on?
I don't know, sir.
"Have at you now!"
I say...
- Are you hurt?
- No.
- No, nothing ever hurts me.
- I'm sorry.
I forgot you were a girl and I'm afraid I got a bit too rough.
What are you talking about?
I had you bettered if I hadn't slipped.
That's a good picture of your grandfather.
He looks pretty grim, but I shouldn't be afraid of him.
Though I can see how his face might frighten some people.
I'll wait upstairs, sir.
His eyes are kind and I like him even though he does bark at you so.
Thank you, ma'am.
So you're not afraid of me?
No, sir, not much.
But my face will frighten some people?
- I only said "might."
- And I bark, do I?
No, sir, perhaps not all the time.
But with all that, you like me?
Yes, sir.
I do.
I do.
And I like you.
Grandfather, you should see her fence.
Come on, let's show him.
- No.
I've been here too long now.
- I'll see you home.
No, you stay indoors, young man.
I shall see Miss March home.
I want to pay my respects to your mother and thank her for the medicine she sent my boy.
I can see it's done him lots of good.
You get upstairs and do your sums.
Brooke is waiting for you.
And see that you behave yourself like a gentleman, sir.
Goodbye, Jo.
Here they come.
All dressed up and looking as pretty as pictures.
Amy, how dainty.
You look lovely.
I wish Laurie hadn't asked me to his party.
I know I shall be frightened.
You wouldn't want to hurt his feelings when he's been so kind.
Meg, the dress is lovely.
Thank you, Marmee.
Jo, you look splendid.
I feel perfectly miserable with 19 hairpins all sticking straight into my head, but, dear me, let us be elegant or die.
Does the patch show much?
It does a little, Marmee.
But she's going to sit down or else stand with her back against the wall.
Jo, where are your gloves?
I've stained them, so I'm going without.
You wear gloves or I don't go.
I tried to clean them, but it only made them look worse.
I'll carry them and hold them crumpled up in one hand.
- Nobody will see them.
- Jo!
I'll tell you.
We'll each wear one of your nice ones and carry one of my bad ones, then the effect will be fine and easy.
All right, only be careful of it, and don't stretch it.
And, Jo, dear, do behave nicely and don't put your hands behind your back.
Good night, Marmee.
Above everything, don't say:
"Christopher Columbus!" and disgrace us all.
Hold your tongue, Miss Baby.
I'll be as prim as I can be and not get into any scrapes, if I can help it.
May I engage you for this dance, Miss March?
No, thank you, I'm not dancing.
- There's that Kitty Ford.
- Where?
There in the pink dress and blue sash.
I don't see why she's allowed with the grownups and I have to stay up here.
That beautiful piano.
It's as big as our kitchen.
What's this?
Why aren't you young ladies downstairs dancing?
Mother said we weren't to go down with the grownups.
But can you see anything from here?
How about you?
She just likes to listen to the music.
You just come down with me where it's playing.
- No, sir, please.
I...
- Why not?
What's the matter?
She has an infirmity.
She's shy.
I see.
If it weren't for that, she'd be simply "fastidious" because she plays beautifully.
She must come and play for me sometime.
No, she never would.
It wasn't that I wanted to hear her.
But that piano down there is simply going to ruin for want of use.
I was hoping one of you young ladies would come and practice on it just to keep it in tune.
- But if you don't care to come, never mind.
- Sir.
We do care.
Very, very much.
So you're the musical one.
I'm Beth.
I love it dearly and I'll come if you're quite sure nobody will hear me and be disturbed.
Not a soul, my child.
Not a soul.
You come, too, young lady and tell your mother I think all her daughters are simply "fastidious."
Beth, isn't he elegant?
This is the German, and I'll be hanged if I'll let you refuse me all of them.
Don't you like to dance?
Yes, I love to dance, but I can't.
- I mean, I promised I wouldn't.
- Why?
- I may as well tell you.
You won't tell?
- Silence to the death.
You see, I have a bad trick of standing in front of the fire and I scorched my frock and I burned this one.
Where?
You can laugh if you want to.
It is funny.
I'll tell you how we'll manage.
There's no one in the hall.
We could dance there without being seen.
- You're a trump.
- And I think you're just perfectly splendid.
Hello.
What are you doing up there?
Come on down.
No, they can't.
Have you had refreshments?
No, thank you, we really don't care for...
We'll bring some right up.
Come on.
Then when Laurie goes to college, what becomes of you?
I shall turn soldier as soon as he is off.
I am needed.
I'm so sorry.
I mean, I'm so sorry for all the mothers and sisters who have to stay home and worry.
I have neither and very few friends to care whether I live or die.
Laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal.
And we all would be very sorry if any harm came to you.
Would you?
Here we come.
Jo!
Now you've done it!
- Look at me.
- It's a shame.
What a blunderbuss I am.
What are you going to do?
I'll ask Marmee.
Have you two been hiding?
I've been looking all over the house for you.
Hannah's here.
- Is it that late?
- Time slips away.
- Good night, Mr. Brooke.
- Good night, Miss Margaret.
Miss Margaret?
- Goodbye.
I'm glad you came.
- We had an elegant time.
Good night, Amy.
Good night.
- Good night, Laurie.
- Good night, Miss Margaret.
Laurie!
Good night, everybody.
- Don't forget your ice skates tomorrow.
- I won't.
- Good night.
- Good night.
There, I've done my best.
If that won't do, I'll have to wait until I can do better.
Why, what are you up to?
It's a pair of slippers I worked for Mr. Laurence.
He's been so kind about letting me play on his beautiful piano.
I didn't know any other way to thank him, Jo.
- Do you think they're all right?
- They're beautiful.
And I think you're sweet.
Hey, isn't that Amy's hair ribbon?
Yes, but I think she was going to throw it away.
You think?
You'd better vamoose before she catches you.
Now I'll find out why you come to this hole every day.
Is that why you never have any time for me anymore?
Laurie Laurence, give that to me or I'll never speak to you again!
All right, take it.
You're a fine one.
I thought we weren't to have any secrets from each other.
Well, this is altogether different.
I beg your pardon.
Of course, it's different.
Just like a girl.
Can't keep an agreement.
Oh, bilge!
You'll be sorry.
I was going to tell you something very plummy.
A secret.
All about people you know, and such fun.
- What?
- Lf I tell you, you must tell me yours.
- You won't say anything at home?
- Not a word.
- You won't tease me about it in private?
- I never tease.
Fire away.
I sold my story to the Spread Eagle.
Hurrah for Miss March.
Hurrah for Miss March!
The celebrated American authoress!
I didn't want anyone to know until it's out.
- Won't it be fun to see it in print?
- Now, what's yours?
- I know where Meg's glove is.
- Is that all?
- Wait till you hear where it is.
- Where?
- How do you know?
- I saw it.
- Where?
- Pocket.
- All this time?
- Isn't it romantic?
"Romantic"?
Rubbish!
I never heard of anything so horrid.
I wish you hadn't told me.
Of all the sickly sentimental...
Why do things always have to change just when they're perfect?
Meg always used to tell me everything.
Now she keeps things to herself.
She thinks brown eyes are beautiful and John is a lovely name.
He'd better keep away from me or I'll tell him what I think of him trying to break up other people's happiness and spoil their fun.
It doesn't spoil any fun.
It makes it twice as good.
You'll find out when someone falls in love with you.
Soft summer day.
Sun setting through the trees.
Your lover's arms stealing around you.
- I'd like to see anybody try it.
- Would you?
I'll get you!
Now I've got you.
Wait!
Look out, look out!
Let me in, let me in!
- Hey, look out, Laurie.
Don't act like that.
- I'm sorry, Meg.
I'd have beaten her though if I hadn't tripped and fell.
You should have seen...
- It's been a most enjoyable afternoon.
- Thank you.
Paying visits has never been quite so much fun before.
I hope we may do it again very soon.
Goodbye, Mr. Brooke.
Come along, Meg.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Brooke.
- Goodbye, Miss Margaret.
- Good afternoon, Laurie.
- Goodbye, Jo.
- Coming, Laurie?
- All right.
See you tomorrow, Jo.
I've never been so embarrassed in my life.
When will you stop your childish romping ways?
Not until I'm old and stiff, and have to use a crutch.
Jo!
- Hello, Bethie.
- Hello, Jo.
How's my girl?
There's a surprise.
- Come on and hurry up.
- Come on, Jo.
What is it?
Stop yelling.
What is it?
Christopher Columbus!
For me?
Isn't it the most beautiful piano you've ever seen?
Look, this came with it.
- Quick, read it.
See what he says.
- I'll read it.
"To Miss Elizabeth March.
Dear Madam."
How elegant.
"I've had many pairs of slippers in my life, but none that suited me as well as yours.
"I like to pay my debts, so I know you will allow me to send you something...
"...that belonged to the little granddaughter I lost.
"With hearty thanks and best wishes...
"...
I remain your grateful friend and humble servant, James Laurence."
Oh, Bethie!
- Isn't he a really sweet old man?
- Look at these lovely brackets.
Look, it opens!
- You'll have to thank him.
- Yes.
I'll go right now.
Well, I wish I may die!
She'd never have gone in her right mind.
Come in.
I came to thank you, sir.
"But when the piece began, the dogs, the dames and private ends went mad...
"...and bit the man.
"Around from the neighboring streets the wondering neighbors ran...
"...and swore the dog'd lost his wits to bite so good a man.
"The wound seemed sore and sad to every Christian eye...
"...and while they swore the dog was mad..."
Look, Marmee.
Ms. March!
Ms. March.
It's one of them telegraph things, ma'am.
It's Father.
He's in the hospital.
I must go to Washington at once.
Put those in the corner, dear.
What on earth is keeping Jo?
This is all packed, Marmee.
- I don't believe I've forgotten a thing.
- Thank you, dear.
While I'm away, don't forget the Hummel's.
- We won't.
- We'll do our best, Marmee.
Here we are.
Here's some excellent port for your husband.
- Thank you.
How generous.
- I hope you find this dressing gown useful.
Everything's arranged and Brooke will go with you.
There's no need.
I'll be fine.
He's all prepared.
He has commissions for me in Washington.
- He'll be of help to you on the journey.
- How thoughtful of you.
It's such a relief to know that Marmee will have someone to take care of her.
Thank you, very, very much.
Not at all, Miss Margaret.
My kind friend, I can't thank you...
Laurie's outside with the carriage.
We'll wait for you.
The train leaves in an hour.
Here, ma'am, you'll need this.
- I couldn't.
- Please, Marmee, take it.
Where is Jo?
- Jo, what kept you?
- Jo, whatever took you so long?
Here's the money from Aunt March.
And there's my contribution.
$25.
Where did you get it?
- My dear!
- It's mine, honestly.
I only sold what belonged to me.
Your hair!
Jo, you shouldn't have done it.
Aunt March croaked, as she always does, when asked for nine pence.
Marmee, she only sent you just money enough for the ticket.
I knew you would need more so I happened to be going past a barber shop and I saw some tails of hair hanging in the window with the prices marked on them and I thought it would do my brain good to have my mop cut off.
And so I did.
Thank you, dearie.
Are you ready, Marmee?
We'll have to hurry to catch...
Christopher Columbus!
Well, it's boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in order.
- Marmee, you'll miss your train.
- Yes, Marmee, come on.
- Now, girls, go on with your work as usual.
- We will, Marmee.
Can't we go to the train with you, Marmee?
No, I want you all to stay here and comfort each other.
Meg, dear, watch over your sisters.
Be patient, Jo.
Jo, don't do anything rash.
Beth, dear, help all you can.
Amy, be obedient.
No, I want you to stay here.
I want to carry away a picture in my mind of my brave little women to take to Father.
- Goodbye, my darlings.
- Goodbye, Marmee.
God bless us and keep us all.
Jo, are you awake?
Jo, you're crying.
No, I'm not.
Don't cry, dear.
Father will be all right and Mr. Brooke will take care of Marmee.
I'm not crying because of that.
What then?
My hair.
"Yet 'tis whispered that when the gondolas glide through those fatal waters...
"...they still run crimson with the blood of Lady Viella and her gallant lover...
"...slain by the phantom hand.
"The End."
It gives me the shivers.
I'm pins and needles all over.
It's so exciting and so sad.
Who wrote it?
Your sister.
- Really, Jo?
- What?
Let me see.
- And I knew it all the time.
- Isn't that wonderful?
Here it is: "By Miss Josephine March."
Oh, Jo!
I can't believe it!
Beth!
Jo's written a story and it's in the paper.
Isn't that marvelous?
- Really?
- Look!
Don't come near me.
Something's wrong with Beth.
What is it?
- I don't know.
- Where is she?
In Marmee's cupboard.
What's wrong?
What's going on?
Darling, what is it?
Bethie, what is it?
- What's wrong, Bethie?
- What is it?
The baby's dead.
- What baby?
- Mrs. Hummel's.
It died in my lap before she got back with the doctor, Jo.
Now, there, there.
The doctor said it was scarlet fever.
- Scarlet fever!
- Hannah!
You don't think I'll get it, do you, Jo?
Oh, no, Bethie, of course you won't.
But Amy must keep away 'cause she's never had it.
How does it start, Jo?
With a sort of a headache and sore throat and queer feelings all over?
I don't remember.
Laurie, give me that doctor's book.
Jo, I think we'd better get her to bed.
Come along, Bethie.
I'll find out what to do.
- I'll be all right.
- Of course you'll be all right.
Here it is.
Go get Dr. Bangs, will you, Mr. Laurie?
Have him come over as soon as he can.
You stay down here, Amy.
You're to go off to Aunt March's for a spell, just in case.
I won't!
I'll stay right here with Beth.
Be quiet for once, Amy!
I'm not going to be sent away.
I advise you to go, Amy.
Scarlet fever's no joke.
Well, I don't care!
I'd rather get scarlet fever and die than go to Aunt March's.
Now, Amy, be a good girl.
I'll pop around there every day and tell you how Beth is.
I'll tell you what.
Every day, I'll come and take you out driving.
- Well, yes.
- That's our girl.
Oh, Bethie, if you should really be ill, I'll never forgive myself.
I let you go to the Hummel's every day when I should've gone.
No, it's my fault.
I'm the oldest and I should've gone.
I promised Marmee I'd look after you.
Don't you think we ought to telegraph her?
No, we mustn't.
She can't leave your father and it'll only make her all the more anxious.
Please don't telegraph, Jo.
Hannah knows just what to do.
I feel better already.
If Mrs. March can leave her husband, we'd better send for her.
The girls had the telegram all ready, but I wouldn't let them send it.
And now, the poor lady.
Oh, Mother.
What if she shouldn't get here in time?
Is it that bad?
She doesn't know me.
She doesn't look like my Beth.
How are we going to bear it?
Mother and Father, they seem so far away.
I'm here.
Hold on to me.
Jo, dear.
Poor Jo.
You're all worn out.
What does the doctor say?
We're sending for Marmee.
If she were only here.
She will be.
Grandfather and I got fidgety and thought your mother ought to know.
She'd just never forgive us if Beth...
Well, if anything happened so I telegraphed yesterday.
She'll be here, on the 2:00 train tonight, and I'm going to meet her.
Oh, Laurie!
Oh, Marmee!
I beg your pardon, but you're such a dear.
I couldn't help flying at you.
Fly at me again.
I rather like it.
Laurie, you're so silly.
I'd better go.
Well, to the railroad station.
And I shan't spare the horses.
Bless you, Laurie, bless you.
If you really want Bethie please wait until Marmee comes home.
But, God, please don't because she's so...
Please don't.
If God spares Bethie I'll love him and serve him all my life.
If life's as hard as this, I don't see how we shall ever get through it.
What is it?
What is it?
Goodbye, my Bethie.
Goodbye.
The fever's turned.
- She's sleeping naturally.
- The Lord be praised.
Marmee's here.
She's come.
It's so wonderful to have Bethie with us.
Come on, everything's all ready.
Is she all right?
She's not very heavy, is she?
It didn't tire you, did it, dear?
See the lovely flowers Mr. Laurence sent you.
And my birds.
I've never been so happy.
Begging your pardon, do the Marches live here?
Wait till she sees what I brought for her.
Father, dear.
Father, is it really you?
I can't believe she's walking.
- Oh, my dear.
- She hasn't walked since she was ill.
Are you expecting someone?
Why, no.
What do you mean?
Why can't we stay as we are?
Do you have to go and fall in love and spoil all our peace and fun and happy times together?
You're not like your old self a bit.
And you're getting so far away from me.
Meg, don't.
Don't go and marry that man.
I don't intend to go and marry any man.
And if you mean Mr. Brooke, he hasn't asked me.
If he should, I shall merely say quite calmly and decidedly:
"I'm sorry but I agree with Mother that it's too soon."
Oh, Meg!
Hurrah for you!
You're a trump.
My hair.
Then things will be as they used to be, and now that Father's home...
I'll go.
I'll get out of the way.
Now don't forget.
If I could only see his face when you tell him.
Why, Mr. Brooke.
Good day, Miss Margaret.
Won't you come in?
I came to get my umbrella.
That is to see how your father finds himself today.
Why, he's here in the rack.
I mean, it's very well.
I mean...
I'll tell him you're here.
Oh, please.
Are you afraid of me, Margaret?
How could I be when you've been so kind to Father?
I only wish I could thank you for it.
You can.
- Shall I tell you how?
- No.
Please don't.
I only want to know if you care for me a little, Meg.
I love you so much, dear.
Thank you, John.
I agree with Mother, it's too soon.
I'll wait.
I don't mind how long or how hard I have to work if I can only know I'm to have my reward in the end.
Please, give me a little hope.
I'm afraid I can't.
Do you really mean that?
What's this?
What's he doing here?
Get along.
What's going on here?
Who is that?
Mr. Brooke.
The Laurence boy's tutor.
Then it's true.
He might hear you.
He's been so kind to Father.
Well, he'll be much kinder if he goes about his own business and leaves you alone.
I won't stop.
I'm only thinking of your own good, Margaret.
You should make a rich match to help your family.
This rude person has no money, no position in life.
That doesn't mean he never will have.
So he's counting on my money.
He knows you've got rich relatives.
Aunt March, how dare you say such a thing.
My John wouldn't marry for money any more than I would.
I'm not afraid of being poor.
And I know we shall be happy because John loves me and I love him.
Hoity-toity.
Remember this, young lady:
If you marry this rook or hook or crook, he'll take care of you.
Not one penny of my money will he get.
My darling, did you mean it?
I came back for my umbrella and I couldn't help hearing.
Then you will give me leave to work for you and love you?
Yes, John.
"And there to have given and pledged their troth each to the other...
"...and have declared the same by giving and receiving a ring and by joining hands...
"...
I pronounce that they are man and wife.
"In the name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
"Amen."
"God the Father, God the Son...
"...and God the Holy Ghost...
"...bless, preserve and keep you...
"...that ye may so live together in this life...
"...that in the world to come ye may have life everlasting.
"Amen."
The first kiss for Marmee.
Well, John, you've been a traitor.
I hope you'll take care of her.
You're a lucky fellow, John.
- Goodbye, Amy.
- Goodbye.
Don't mind, Jo.
You've still got me.
I'm not good for much, I know but I'll stand by you all the days of my life.
I know you will.
You don't know what a comfort you are to me, Laurie.
- Jo...
- No, don't say it.
I will, and you must hear me.
It's no use, Jo.
You've kept away from me ever since I got back from college.
I studied so hard and I graduated with honors, all for you.
- I know, and I'm so proud of you.
- Then won't you listen?
Please.
I've loved you ever since I've known you.
I couldn't help it.
I've tried to show it, but you wouldn't let me.
Now I'm going to make you hear it and give me an answer for I just can't go on so any longer.
I know I'm not half good enough for you.
But if you love me, you can make me anything you like.
As though I'd change you, Laurie.
You should marry some lovely, accomplished girl who adores you.
Someone who would grace your beautiful home.
I shouldn't.
I loathe elegant society and you like it.
And you hate my scribbling and I can't get on without it.
And we should quarrel.
- No, we shouldn't.
- Yes, we always have, you know.
Everything would be horrid if we were ever foolish enough to...
Marry?
No, it wouldn't, Jo.
It would be heaven.
Don't disappoint us, dear.
Don't.
Everybody expects it.
Grandfather has set his heart on it.
And I just can't go on without you.
Please, say you will.
I can't.
Laurie, I'm sorry.
So desperately sorry.
I'm so grateful to you, and so proud and fond of you.
I don't know why I can't love you the way you want me to.
I've tried, but I can't change the feeling and it would be a lie to say I do if I don't.
Really truly, Jo?
Really truly, dear.
I don't think I'll ever marry.
Yes, you will.
You'll meet some good-for-nothing, no-account idiot and you'll fall in love with him, and work, live and die for him.
I know you will.
It's your way.
And I'll have to stand by and see it.
Well, I'll be hanged if I do.
Where are you going?
To the devil, and I hope you'll be sorry.
Laurie, please...
Why aren't you in bed?
It's late.
Mother, I want to go away.
I mean, just for a little while.
I don't know.
I feel restless and anxious to be doing something.
I'd like to hop a little way and try my wings.
Where would you hop?
To New York.
I've thought about it a lot lately.
You can spare me now.
I could go to Mrs. Kirke's and help with the children as part of my board.
It wouldn't cost much, and I'd see and hear new things and get a lot of new ideas for my stories.
I don't doubt it.
Jo, nothing's happened between you and Laurie?
Don't be surprised, dear.
Mothers have to have sharp eyes especially when their daughters keep their troubles to themselves.
Oh, Marmee, I'd have told you, only I thought it would blow over and it seemed kind of wrong to tell Laurie's poor little secret.
It's only that he's got a foolish romantic notion in his head and I think if I go away for a time, he may get over it.
I see.
And how do you feel about this "foolish romantic notion"?
I love him dearly as I always have.
I feel as though I've stabbed my dearest friend.
And yet, I don't want to make a mistake.
You're right, Jo.
I think it would be a good idea for both your sakes.
Now, come to bed, dear.
I'll talk to Father about it.
And if he agrees, we'll write to Mrs. Kirke.
- Good night, dear.
- Good night, Marmee.
Now, my dear, I think I've told you everything and it will be a great load off my mind knowing the children are safe with you.
I'm very busy so I'll have Mamie show you to your room.
Mamie!
I've given you a little inside room.
It's all I had but it has a table and you can use it for your writing.
That's great.
Mamie!
You must come down here some after dinner and be sociable.
I promised your mother I wouldn't let you be homesick and I have only the most refined people in my house.
Mamie!
Here I am, Ms. Kirke.
Mamie, this is Miss Josephine.
Will you take her up to her room and find the children?
I'll see you later, my dear.
Right this way, please.
Children, children!
They ain't a bad lot but, my stars, they take a deal of handling.
Jimmy!
Kitty!
You heard me.
Come on out, I know where you are.
The bear's going to eat my baby.
Save my poor baby.
My baby!
Don't eat my baby!
Professor!
I beg your pardon.
Please.
I'm so sorry.
This is Miss Josephine what's got you in charge now.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
- And this is Professor Bhaer.
- How do you do?
- Come on, let's finish the game.
- I want to play some more.
That is for Miss Josephine to say, but we've frightened her already.
Oh, no, but I didn't expect to meet a grizzly bear in the upper hall.
Mamie, wait.
The back is too young to carry such heavy loads.
Come on, children, let's play soldiers.
Tina, you are the general.
You're the captain.
And here, Lieutenant.
Forward march!
He's such a lovely man.
I know he must've been a gentleman sometime or other but he's as poor as a church mouse now.
What does he do?
He's a professor, see?
He learns them how they talk in foreign countries.
I don't know what good it does them when they're living right here.
Good evening, my little friend, good evening.
Please, don't stop.
It was beautiful.
I've heard you play it often and wanted to ask you what it was.
I'd so like to send it to my little sister.
Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt.
The words are by Goethe.
Do you speak German?
Then I'd better give it to you in English.
Let's see now.
"Only who knows what longing is
"Can know what I suffer
"Alone and parted far from joy and gladness
"My senses fail
"A burning fire devours me
"My senses fail
"A burning fire devours me"
I know how he felt.
Tchaikovsky did, also.
That is why he wrote this beautiful, heartbreaking music.
If only I could write something like that.
Something splendid that would set other hearts on fire.
That is genius.
Do you wish to write, my little friend?
Yes, that's my longing.
I've sold two stories already since I've been here.
That is very good.
I'd like to read them.
May I?
Would you?
I'd so like to know your opinion.
I would be very happy.
You have the ardent spirit.
I like that.
What shall I ask for at the music shop?
I think I'd better write it down for you.
Well, now, here is a teacher without a pencil.
Let me sew that button for you before you lose it.
No, I sew on buttons.
Not very well, evidently.
Well.
- Who was Goldilocks, a little girl?
- Yes.
"And she...
"...went into their house...
"...and saw three chairs.
"Three chairs.
"One was the baby one, one was the daddy one...
"...and one was the mommy one.
"So she sat down in the big one...
"And it was too hard."
Miss Josephine, you're to go to the parlor right away.
Someone to see you.
- Who is it?
- I can't tell you.
It's a surprise.
All right, children, that will be all for today.
Now run along and wash your hands and faces for tea.
- I'll finish the story tomorrow.
- All right.
- Who is it, Mamie?
- I can't tell you.
It's a surprise.
Are these some of your new stories?
Oh, they look creepier than The Duke's Daughter.
Can I read them?
Yes, if you want to.
"The Place of the Coventrys or The Secret of a Guilty Heart...
"...by Josephine March."
Then it's true.
- Amy!
- Darling!
- Aunt March!
- Josephine.
I'm so glad to see you.
What took you so long to get down?
Tell me everything.
We can't stop now.
We've got to get to the shipping office before it closes.
Shipping office?
Aunt March, Europe?
I'm taking Amy with me.
Well, maybe you can go next time.
Next time?
Tell me, is Meg all right?
And Marmee and Father?
And how's my Beth?
She's better again, but she isn't rosy as she used to be.
Oh, my poor Beth.
Why doesn't she get strong?
And Laurie?
Didn't you see them when they were here?
He and his grandfather have been in Europe for weeks.
Laurie in New York?
And didn't come to see me?
I'm sure you can't blame him after the way you picked up and trotted off without so much as saying goodbye to any of us.
I think you've treated everybody shamefully.
Come along, Amy.
Jo, dear, I wish it were you.
I know how you've always longed to go.
No, darling.
It's your reward.
You've always done sweet things to please Aunt March.
Think of all the wonderful things you are going to see:
The Turners, the Raphaels and the Leonardos.
You seem to forget waiting cabs cost money.
That's the trouble with folks who never had anything.
Easy come, easy go.
We'll be right back, Josephine.
Goodbye, darling.
Miss Josephine?
Yes, Professor Bhaer.
I have read your stories and I would like to return them to you.
Will you please come in?
Yes, thank you.
Did you like them?
Well, Miss March, I must be honest.
I was disappointed.
Why do you write such artificial characters such artificial plots, villains, murderers and such women?
Why don't you write a...
Miss March, please.
I am so sorry.
I didn't want to hurt you.
I wanted to help you.
What a blundering fool I am.
It isn't that.
Please, don't pay any attention to me.
Forgive me, please.
Come, sit down.
Forgive me.
No, it's just that everything seems to come at once.
The rest doesn't matter so much.
I can bear that.
But Laurie, I can never get over Laurie.
Herr Laurie, your friend.
- Something has happened to him?
- Yes.
No, something has happened to me.
He came to New York and he didn't even come to see me.
What a fool he must be.
No, it's my fault.
But I thought that...
What does it matter what I thought?
I've made a mess of it as I do of everything.
But I have tried and when I think of Aunt March taking Amy to Europe when she always promised she'd take me not that I begrudge Amy the trip, but...
I suppose that's just what I am doing.
That trip to Europe that you so looked forward to.
That is too bad.
That is a cruel disappointment, I know.
On top of it, that stupid professor.
He comes blundering and makes things worse.
No.
If I can't stand the truth, I'm not worth anything.
I didn't think those stories were so very good.
But you see The Duke's Daughter paid the butcher's bill and the Curse of the Coventrys was the blessing of the Marches because it sent Marmee and Beth to the seashore.
Yes, that is what I have thought.
And then I have said to myself:
"I maybe have no right to speak."
But then again, I said to myself:
"I maybe have no right to be silent."
Miss March, you have talent.
- Do you really think so?
- Otherwise I could not say.
And you know that.
And I say to you, "Sweep mud on the street first...
"...before you are false to that talent."
Say to yourself:
"I will never write one single line which I have not heard in my own heart."
Say to yourself, "While I am young...
"...
I will write these simple, beautiful things that I understand now.
"Maybe later, when I am a little older and I have felt life more...
"...then I will write about these poor wretches...
"...but I will make them live and breathe like my Shakespeare did."
- Will you do that, my little friend?
- Yes, I'll try.
But I don't think I'll ever be a Shakespeare, do you?
But you can be a Josephine March.
And I assure you that is plenty.
And now, don't be disappointed about that trip.
- Here.
- Peppermint, good.
Those of us who have been all over the Old World can find many things in the New that are beautiful and young.
Miss March, it would give me great pleasure if I could show you some of these things while you are here.
If you would care to have so.
Thank you.
Then you are not angry with the blundering professor who takes the wrong times for his lectures?
How could I be?
Auf Wiedersehen, my little friend.
Did you really like it?
- I never had such a...
- Happy, my little friend.
She was divine.
I don't want to be a writer anymore.
I want to be a wonderful singer and thrill thousands of people so that they cheer and throw flowers at me like that.
Bravo.
Bravo.
But I wouldn't make up my mind so soon because at the art museum you wanted to be a sculptress at the circus you thought the bareback rider was the most beautiful thing in the world.
I know, but to sing like that!
I forgot.
Something inside me tonight makes me want to shout.
What would you shout?
I'd say, "Look at me, world.
I'm Jo March and I'm so happy."
My little friend, you are happy.
You haven't missed much lately your home and your old friends?
But you're responsible for that.
Maybe they haven't missed me so much either.
They're so busy with Meg and those blessed babies.
Yes, how are those remarkable twins?
Wonderful.
Meg's so proud of them.
Have you heard from Europe?
Nearly every boat brings a letter from Amy.
And your friend Herr Laurie, have you heard from him?
Only through Amy.
They met at Vichy and had a wonderful time together.
Miss March, I am bold to ask a favor.
Would you give me the address of your father?
I wish to write him and ask him something.
Why, yes.
He'd be so happy to hear from you.
They almost know you.
I've told them all about you.
And they always ask after you in their letters.
- Really?
- Yes, now I'll show you.
This is so nice.
Not I hope...
It's Beth.
She's...
I must go at once.
My friend, can I do something for you?
I'm sure there is something I can do.
No, there's nothing.
Thank you.
Oh, Jo to think you're home.
If Amy were here, we'd all be together.
She'll be home in the spring, darling.
And I'm going to have you all well and rosy by then.
Poor Jo, you mustn't be afraid.
Doesn't that sound funny me saying that to you when you've always said it to me?
You've always reminded me of a seagull, strong and wild and fond of the wind and the storm dreaming of flying far out to sea.
And Mother always said that I was like a little cricket chirping contentedly on the hearth never able to bear the thought of leaving home.
But now it's different.
I can't express it very well.
I shouldn't try to, to anyone but you because I can't speak out to anyone but my Jo.
I'm not afraid anymore.
I'm learning that I don't lose you, that you'll be more to me than ever and nothing can part us, though it seems to.
Oh, Jo.
I think I'll be homesick for you even in heaven.
The little loves.
- I'm afraid they're tiring you.
- Oh, no.
It's time for my little regiment to take its nap.
- They're sweet.
- Yes.
I think I can sleep now.
Look, Jo, my birds.
They got back in time.
- Bethie!
- Mother!
My daughter!
Bethie!
Oh, Marmee.
We mustn't cry.
We must be glad she's well at last.
No, Marmee, don't cry.
If only there were another boat leaving sooner.
Now, my dear, you've been so brave, you must be patient.
We're going back on the very first boat.
I still think you should obey your mother and stay.
I know.
But I'm sick for home, Aunt March.
I hate all this now.
If it weren't for this, I'd have been there, at least to say goodbye.
Laurie, I knew you'd come.
My child!
Mr. Laurence!
Amy, we were in Germany, and Marmee's letter had to be forwarded but I came the moment I got it because...
Well, you must comfort me now, too.
I'm so thankful you're here.
I haven't known what to do with the child.
Perhaps you can persuade her to stay.
- The elegant young matron.
- Hello, Jo, dear.
I've Sally Moffat's carriage.
I'm making some calls.
You want me to mind the demons while you're gone?
No, I want you to go with me.
Jo, dear.
It's a lovely day and I want to talk to you.
Talk to me now.
You know I can't bear calls.
- How's your story coming?
- Sent it off yesterday.
- Without us reading it?
- You can read it when they send it back.
- I had a letter from Amy.
- So did Marmee.
They're in Valrosa now and she says it's paradise.
Jo, I'd like to ask you something.
I've been wondering how would you feel if you should hear that your Laurie was learning to care for somebody else?
Meg, who?
Amy?
I don't know.
I can't be sure.
I'm only reading between the lines.
Then you wouldn't mind?
No, Meg.
How could I?
I think it would be wonderful, don't you?
Yes, but I wasn't quite sure.
Forgive me, dear but I have so much and you seem so alone.
I thought lately that maybe if Laurie came back...
No, dear.
It's better as it is.
And I'm glad if he and Amy are learning to love each other.
You're right about one thing though.
I am lonely and maybe if Laurie had come back I might've said yes.
Not because I love him any differently, but because it means more to me now to be loved than it used to.
Laurie.
Oh, my Laurie!
Jo, dear.
Are you glad to see me?
Glad?
My blessed boy!
Words can't express my gladness.
And where's your wife?
They all stopped in at Meg's, but I couldn't wait to see you.
They'll be along presently.
Let me look at you.
Don't I look like a married man and the head of a family?
Not a bit, and you never will, although you have grown bigger and bonnier.
But you're the same scapegrace as ever, despite that very elegant mustache.
- You can't fool me.
- You have to treat me with more respect.
Jo, dear, I want to say one thing, then we'll put it by forever.
No, Laurie, please.
I think it was always meant to be, you and Amy.
It would have come about naturally if only you'd waited.
As you tried to make me understand.
But you never could be patient.
So then we can go back to the happy old times?
The way you wanted it, when we first knew one another.
We never can be boy and girl again, Laurie.
Those happy old times can't come back.
We shouldn't expect them to.
We're man and woman now, we can't be playmates any longer.
But we can be brother and sister, to love and help one another all the rest of our lives, can't we, Laurie?
There they are.
You look very well, Aunt March.
After the money spent on my rheumatism, I come home on a day like this.
Heaven's to Betsy.
If she ain't dressed in silk from head to foot.
Where is she?
Where is Jo?
- Jo!
- Amy!
Doesn't she look marvelous, Jo?
I'll never forgive myself for staying away so long and leaving you to bear everything all alone.
Darling.
To think that only yesterday we were pulling our hair and buttoning pinafores.
And now she's a grown-up married lady with a bustle.
You must be famished.
I'll help Hannah with the tea.
No, you won't, Marmee.
You'll sit right here.
I'll help Hannah.
It's fun, isn't it, Bethie?
Now that we're all together again.
Oh, dear.
I've got to get some milk.
I haven't enough for my babies.
I'll go.
- But it's raining cats and dogs.
- I love it.
Sakes alive!
There's the front doorbell.
- Is this the residence of Miss March?
- Why, yes.
- Miss Josephine March?
- Yes.
May I speak with her?
She's out, but I'm expecting her back any minute.
- Won't you come in?
- Thank you.
No, thank you.
She has guests, no.
Thank you very much.
But will you please give this to her and tell her Professor Bhaer left it?
Thank you.
Professor Bhaer.
Thank you very much.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Herr Professor.
- My little friend.
I was just here to leave your book.
I wanted to tell you my friend published it, and he has great hopes.
- He thinks...
- Never mind what he thinks.
Did you like it?
My little friend, it has such truth, such simple beauty.
In English quick, I cannot tell you what it gives my heart.
But you were going without telling me.
If I hadn't come back, I never would've seen you again.
- Come, you're getting wet.
- I couldn't intrude.
You have guests.
No, only my family.
My sister has just come home.
She is married to that boy I told you about.
- Herr Laurie?
- Yes.
This is the first time we've all been together for a long time.
Please, just one moment before...
I had a wish to ask you something.
Would you...
I have no courage to think that...
But could I dare hope that...
I know I shouldn't make so free as to ask.
I have nothing to give but my heart so full and these empty hands.
Not empty now.
Heart's dearest!
Welcome home.
- Is this too fast?
- Harder!
My sisters and I remember that winter as the coldest of our childhood.
A temporary poverty had settled upon our family some years before.
The war had made fuel and lamp oil scarce but necessity is indeed the mother of invention.
Somehow in that dark time our family, the March family seemed to create its own light.
Marmee!
Marmee's home!
- Marmee!
- Marmee!
We waited and waited!
We've been expectorating you for hours!
- Have you, my darling?
- "Expecting," featherhead.
- Oh, Marmee, you're frozen.
- Yes.
If you could see the people lined up outside Hope House in this bitter cold.
Your cheeks are so warm.
Thank you, Cricket.
Are you finished the Christmas bundles?
So many this year.
We were handing out--
- Oh, how is your cold?
- Better.
Good.
We were handing out food as quickly as we could make up the baskets.
- Miss Amy, what is this in my pocket?
- Father!
"My dearest family, I am well and safe.
Our battalion is encamped on the Potomac."

"December makes a hard, cold season for all of us so far from home.
I think of my girls day and night and find my best comfort in your affection.
I pray that your own hardships will not be too great to bear.
Give them all my dear love and a kiss.
Tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night."
- Poor father.
- I'm a selfish girl.
Aw.
Little ones.
It's Christmas Eve.
Father wouldn't want us to be sad now.

Late at night, my mind would come alive with voices and stories and friends as dear to me as any in the real world.
I gave myself up to it, longing for transformation.
Oh, what miraculous food.
- Isn't this just like the old days, Hannah?
- Oh.
We shouldn't eat it.
We should just look at it.
- I'm going to eat it.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Jo?
Jo, come down.
I'm awake!
Horrible piano.
Hannah's put together an absolute Christmas miracle.
Is that sausage?
Wait.
Butter!
Oh, isn't butter divinity?
Oh, God, thank you for this breakfast.
Jo, angel, fetch your Marmee.
She went out at the crack of dawn to see some Germans.
Hummel, the boy said.
Not a word of English.
His da's gone.
Six children, and she's about to issue another.
May as well take them a stick of firewood.
Sure they haven't got any.
Or breakfast either.
Perhaps we could send the Hummels our bread.
Might as well send the butter too.
Butter's not much use without bread to put it on.
Oh, wonderful snow.
Don't you wish you could roll about in it like dogs?
Once one of our finest families.
Lovely weather for a picnic!
Come along, Theodore.
We'll be late for church.
Jo, you should let them speak first.
What will they think of us?
Oh, don't look back.

Pauline cried out in horror as her bridegroom's mask fell disclosing not her lover, Ferdinand but the face of his sworn enemy, Count Antonio.
'Revenge is mine,' quoth he."
Continued in the following edition.
Excellent installment, Mr. Snodgrass.
- Oh, I love forbidden marriages.
- You ought to publish it, Jo.
Really.
Not just in the Pickwick Portfolio.
Mr. Tupman, are you demeaning our fine newspaper?
- Mr. Winkle.
- Ahem.
"One periwink-
- Advertisement."
"One periwinkle sash belonging to Mr. N. Winkle has been abscondated from the wash line which gentleman desires any reports leading to its recovery."
Gentlemen of the press, hear, hear.
I call to your attention our Mr. Tupman's "The History of the Squash."
- Oh, don't read mine.
- Beth, this isn't a story.
It's a recipe.
Oh, dear, I never know what to write.
First rule of writing, Mr. Tupman, is never write what you know.
What do we think of the boy?
Is he a captive like Smee in Nicholas Nickleby?
He looks lonely.
You don't think he'll try to call?
Maybe he has a secret.
A tragic, European secret.
He's had no upbringing at all, they say.
He was reared in Italy among artists and vagrants.
Doesn't he have a noble brow?
If I were a boy, I'd wanna look just like that.
Imagine giving up Italy to come live with that awful old man.
Oh, Jo, please don't say "awful." It's slang.
I'd be terrified to live with him.
I shouldn't mind living in such a fine house, and having nice things.
Oh, it doesn't seem like Christmas this year without presents.
I'm desperate for drawing pencils.
I wish I didn't have to work for Great-Aunt March, that crabby old miser.
And you, Beth.
What's your Christmas wish?
I'd like the war to end so father can come home.
Oh, sweet Beth.
We all want that.
They do have a beautiful piano.
Wait till I'm a writer.
I'll buy you the best piano in creation.
And if she doesn't, you can come over and play mine.
When I marry, I'm going to be disgustingly rich.
And what if the man you love is a poor man, but good like father?
Well, it isn't like being stuck with the dreadful nose you get.
One does have a choice to whom one loves.
You have a lovely nose.
Well, I wouldn't marry for the money.
I mean, what if his business goes bust?
Besides, down at the Eagle, they pay $5 for each story they print.
Why, I have 10 stories in my head right now.
Gentlemen, I dislike all this money talk.
It isn't refined.
Well, if lack of attention to personal finances is a mark of refinement then I'd say the Marches are the most elegant family in Concord.
We'll all grow up someday, Meg.
We might as well know what we want.
That'll do, that'll do.
Put the carriage away, and look smart about it.
Very good, sir.
Merry Christmas.
I have the most wonderful feeling about tonight.
Meg and Jo, you have to tell me everything about Belle Gardiner.
What her nose looks like and about her ring.
Annie Gardiner says it's an emerald.
Can you imagine?
Everyone's lucky but me.
I'm glad I don't have to go and be with all those frightening people...
- ...and try to think of things to say.
- Hush now.
Oh, mind you, Jo, don't eat much at supper.
And don't shake hands with people.
It isn't the thing anymore.
- Jo, your dress!
- Oh, I know!
You always stand too close to the fire.
Oh, dear.
Well, just keep your backside to the wall.
Meg, look.
What cunning little heels.
They're rather small.
That's all right.
It's only for one night.
You don't suppose anyone will notice they came out of the rag bag, do you?
Mm-mm.
You have to have heels.
Ow.
What's that strange smell?
Like burnt feathers.
- Heavens above.
- You've ruined me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have had me do it.
- Meg, don't worry.
It'll grow back.
- I spoil everything.
I can't go out like this.
Well, good!
I'm not going either.
Here, we'll place my bow in front.
Ooh.
- Yes, that covers it.
- It's very becoming, Meg.
I'll never have any suitors.
I'll just be a dried-up old spinster.
You don't need scores of suitors.
You only need one, if he's the right one.
Listen to the child.
Meg isn't going to be married right away, is she?
With Jo's help, I never will.
- Oh, you must be so happy.
- Oh, Belle, it's enchanting.
Well, I best go and help Mama.
Excuse me.
I think it's Mrs. Barkley.
She's going to try it.
Watch her.
Oh, yes, I would like it very much.
That's very kind.
Ooh!
Ooh.
Jehoshaphat!
I'm sorry.
No, no, stay.
It's not a bad hiding place, is it?
You see, I don't know anyone so I feel awkward just standing and staring at people.
Should I put on my jacket?
I never know the rules.
Uh, um, I'm Laurie.
Theodore Laurence, but I'm called Laurie.
Jo March.
Um--
So who were you staring at?
You, actually.
What game were you playing?
Ha, ha.
I don't know, but I think I won.
- Who else?
- Well, I was--
I was quite taken with that one.
That's Meg.
That's my sister.
She's completely bald in front.
Is it true that you lived in Italy among artists and vagrants?
Heh.
Well, my mother was Italian.
A pianist.
- Grandfather disapproved of her.
- Truly?
I saw a play like that once.
Do you like the theater?
- Oh, yes.
- Were you born there?
Where?
In-
- Heh.
In Italy.
- Do you speak French or Italian?
- English at home.
The music conservatory in Vevey.
But grandfather's having me tutored now.
- He insists I go to college.
- Oh, I'd commit murder to go to college.
Mm.
Actually, I'm going to Europe.
Well, at least I hope I am.
My Great-Aunt March says she'll go one of these days and she has to take me with her because I work as her companion.
I have to read to her for hours and hours.
- But I do all the voices.
Heh.
- Heh, heh.
I'll bet you do.
If I weren't going to be a writer, I'd go to New York and pursue the stage.
- Are you shocked?
- Very.
- Ow.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Meg always makes me take the gentleman's part at home.
It's a shame you don't know the lady's part.
Are you looking at the back of my dress, you cheat?
It doesn't look so bad.
Honestly.
You promised you wouldn't look.
Oh, Jo.
Jo, I've sprained my ankle.
I shouldn't wonder, in those shoes.
Does it hurt?
Oh, no, no.
I'm quite well, thank you.
Well, this is our neighbor, Laurie, the captive.
Oh, poor Meg.
I'll go tell Mrs. Gardiner.
Oh, no, Jo.
She'll think I've been sampling the punch.
- A perfectly good party ruined.
- Well, I have my carriage.
- Let me take you home.
- Oh, yes!
Oh, no, thank you.
Thank you.
Here, lean on me.
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.
That's very kind of you.
- Not at all.
- Goodbye, Laurie.
- Good night, Mrs. March.
- Meg, wherever did you get this shoe?
Did you ride in his carriage?
Oh, you two have all the luck.
- Oh, Jo, is he very romantic?
- Not in the slightest.
Well, we're very much obliged to him, but he's a dreadful boy.
Well, he did a good deed putting snow on this ankle.
- He put snow on your ankle?
- To bed, Miss Amy.
- With his own hands?
- Oh, stop being so swoony.
I won't have my girls being silly about boys.
To bed.
Jo, dear.
Does this hurt?
- Everything lovely happens to Meg.
- Oh, yes indeed!
You mustn't be soppy about Laurie any more than you should be soppy about those silly girls at school.
- I hope we shall be good friends with him.
- With a boy?
He isn't a boy.
He's Laurie.
Faster!
Faster!
Ha, ha.
- Faster!
- Laurie!
Your young ladies are unusually active, Mrs. March...
- ...if I may say so.
- Ha.
You may indeed, Mr. Brooke.
It's my opinion that young girls are no different than boys in their need for exertion.
Feminine weakness and fainting spells are the direct result of our confining young girls to the house bent over their needlework in restrictive corsets.
- Marmee.
- Oh.
- Laurie.
- Your young student is an athlete.
He is, thank you, a good one.
But he makes an unruly scholar.
I regret that his grandfather is away much.
One hopes that your girls will be a gentling influence.
- Indeed, Mr. Brooke.
- No!
Marmee, must you speak to everyone about corsets?
Oh, Meg.
Do I?
Blast these wretched skirts!
Don't say "blast" and "wretch."
Amy, don't be such a ninny-pinny.
I wish I was Beth so I could stay home and do pleasant things.
Oh, if you call doing laundry and housework pleasant.
Blast.
Amy, hurry.
I'll be late for work.
There's Mrs. King.
I'm tardy again.
Lovely children.
Oh, Meg, must I go to school?
I'm so degradatated.
I can hardly hold my head up.
I owe at least a dozen limes.
- Limes?
- Are limes the fashion now?
Of course they are.
It's nothing but limes now.
Everyone keeps them in their desks, and trades them for beads and things.
And all the girls treat each other at recess.
If you don't bring limes to school, you're nothing.
You might as well be dead.
I've had ever so many limes, and I can't pay anyone back.
Well, no wonder you don't learn anything at that school.
I know how it feels to do without any little luxuries.
Meg!
But we are not destitute, not yet.
Here's a quarter.
Marmee gave me the rag money this month.
Go on.
"Secondly, the immortality of the soul is asserted to be in consequence of its immateriality as in all leipothymic cases consistent with the idea of immortality and immorality, and physicality...."
And I think you finally dozed off.
Josephine, there's a draft!
Is it father?
Teacher struck me.
- He put the limes out into the snow.
- Oh....
May Chester said my limes must have been donated to Hope House.
And then I said that she wouldn't get a single lime from me.
And then she told Mr. Davis they were hidden in my desk and then he struck me.
We ought to go over there and beat the tar out of him with his own stick!
Jo, we must not embrace violence.
- No, I will write this man a letter.
- A letter?
That'll show him.
You failed to mention to me they were forbidden.
A whole month's rag money?
- Amy, I shouldn't have given it to you.
- I'm sorry.
All those lovely limes.
I'm perfectly desolated.
Well, I'm not sorry you lost them.
It's a frivolous concern in times like these.
You are more intent upon reshaping your dear little nose than in fashioning your character.
It's an appalling school.
Your spelling's atrocious your Latin absurd.
Mr. Davis said it was as useful to educate a woman as to educate a female cat.
I really must strangle Mr. Davis.
"Mr. Davis.
What right have you to strike a child?
In God's eyes, we are all children and we are all equals.
If you hit and humiliate a child, the only lesson she will learn is to hit and humiliate."
Amy, do you think you can discipline yourself to learn at home as Beth has done?
"I withdraw my daughter Amy from your school."
It serves the scoundrel right.
Jo will now supervise your education.
Jo, tell me what happens next after the duke turns his back on his family fortune and saves Lady Zara.
Don't know.
It's all murder and gore.
- The damsel's in distress.
- Oh, I love your damsels in distress.
Oh, Beth, truly, I don't know if I could ever be good like Marmee.
I rather crave violence.
If only I could be like Father and go to war and stand up to the lions of injustice.
And so Marmee does in her own way.
Yes.
But I want to do something different.
I don't know what it is yet, but I'm on the watch for it.
You will find it, Jo.
Hello!
Jo!
Come over here.
You too, Meg.
It's dull as tombs around here.
Mr. Laurence, one doesn't shout at ladies as if they were cattle.
My apologies!
All right.
What do those girls do over there all day?
Over the mysteries of female life there is drawn a veil best left undisturbed.
Oh, dear countess, pray for me for I have sinned against meself and me brother Rodrigo.
You've got to say "sinned" as if you've really sinned.
Sinned.
Sinned.
Rodrigo.
You arrive seeking the Duke of Lankershire.
Hark ye.
Who goes there?
Oh, I forgot the cymbals.
Why it's-
- It's Rodrigo!
- Rodrigo.
- I want to be Lady Violet.
I'm exhaustified of being the boy.
The play is the thing, Amy.
You're too little to be Lady Violet.
Here, be the Countess de Montanescu.
- You don't have any lines.
- Besides, who would be our Rodrigo?
Ahem.
Gentlemen.
Ahem.
I propose the admission of a new member to our theatrical society.
Theodore Laurence.
We'll put it to a vote.
Nay.
He'll laugh at our acting, and poke fun at us later.
He'll think it's only a game.
No, he won't.
Upon my word as a gentleman.
Jo, when it's only ladies, we don't guard our conduct in the same way.
We bear our souls and tell the most appalling secrets.
He would find us improper.
Oh, Teddy would do nothing of the sort.
Oh, please.
Let's try him.
Shall we?
- Jo!
- Jo, you traitor!
Fellow artists, may I present myself as an actor, a musician, and a loyal...
- ...and very humble servant of the club.
- We'll be the judge of that.
In token of my gratitude, and as a means of promoting shouting from windows being forbidden, I shall provide a post office in our hedge to further encourage the baring of our souls and the telling of our most appalling secrets.
I do pledge never to reveal what I receive in confidence here.
Well, then do take your place, Rodrigo.
Sir Rodrigo.
And so Laurie was admitted as an equal into our society and we March girls could enjoy the daily novelty of having a real brother of our very own.
I want to go to the theater.
I never get to go anywhere.
You're too little.
Beth, where in tarnation are Marmee's opera glasses?
I'm not too little.
You're just hogging Laurie.
Please, can't I go?
Oh, Amy, I'm afraid Laurie only reserved four seats.
Do I look too shabby?
Oh, Jehoshaphat, Meg, this isn't a coronation.
It's just Laurie and that awful Mr. Brooke.
Jo, can't you ask Teddy to get another ticket?
No.
You have a cold, dear.
Rest your eyes.
Evangeline and I will make you some ginger tea.
You're weeks behind in algebra.
Now, I want you to do all the pages that I've marked.
I won't have a sister who's a lazy ignoramus.
And don't sulk.
You look like a pigeon.
- Good night.
- Mm.
You'll be sorry for this, Jo March!
Whoa.
Whoa, there.
Oh.
Thank you.
Oh, Mrs. Nell Watson.
Wasn't she a wonderful swooner?
If only I were the swooning type.
If only I were the catching type.
Young Laurence informs me that you are an aficionado of the theater, Miss March.
- Well, I....
I enjoy reading plays.
- Yes.
I find it most pleasurable, myself.
Though, I confess, I'm distracted at the theater thinking of the peculiar lives of the actors themselves.
When one considers the immodesties Mrs. Nell Watson suffers one wonders what sort of lady would seek such a life.
Meg is a sensational actress.
We're always putting on wild theatricals.
Oh, it's just something that we play at.
Well, as a matter of fact, at school, I engaged in debating.
What do you think of that?
Let's see what they do.
- I had a wonderful time, Mr. Brooke.
- As did I.
It was a most delightful evening.
- And I'd very much like--
- Thank you very much.
Good night.
- Oh, good night.
- Good night.
- That was rude.
- You plastered yourself on him.
It's proper to take a gentleman's arm if it's offered.
How was the theater?
Amusing?
It was wonderful.
I was absolutely inspired by the love scene.
You look flushed, Meg, dear.
Was the theater overcrowded?
Still sulking?
Beth, where did I put my manuscript?
Beth.
No.
No.
No.
I didn't do it!
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!
- Marmee, help me!
- I'm gonna kill you!
Do you hear me?
- How could you do this to me?
- Marmee!
- Marmee!
- Jo!
- Jo, stop it.
You're hurting her.
- Marmee!
Aah!
- Marmee!
- Jo!
Jo!
Let go of her!
- What's happened?
Jo.
All right.
- I hate you!
I hate you!
Jo.
No, Jo!
Don't touch it.
Let it go, sweetheart.
Come, just let it go.
You're dead!
You're nothing!
I never want to see you again!
It is a very great loss, and you have every right to be put out.
But don't let the sun go down upon your anger.
Forgive each other.
Begin again tomorrow, huh?
I will never forgive her.
I'm sorry, Jo.
Looks like the last ice we'll have this year.
Say "go."
Laurie, Jo, wait for me!
Ignore her.
- Ready-
- Blast!
- Ha-ha-ha.
- You cheat!
- Whoa!
Jo, please.
Aah!
- Jo!
- Amy!
- Jo!
- Hold on!
I'm coming!
Hold on, Amy.
Get a rail!
Grab the stick, Amy.
- Grab it!
- Come on!
Oh!
- Hold on!
- Hold on.
Hold on.
- There we go.
That's it, that's it.
- All right.
There we go.
Josephine March, you walked all the way from Walden Pond...
- ...in only these bloomers?
- As if she even noticed.
- Dear Amy.
- How could I have been so horrible?
Thank God for Laurie.
Jo, do you love Laurie more than you love me?
Oh, don't be such a beetle.
I could never love anyone as I love my sisters.
I'm not a beetle.
Oh, look out.
You're leaving out the best part.
When Lady Zara succumbs to the duke's rival.
Oh, right, yes.
Sir Hugo.
I quite prefer him, myself.
In the spring, we turned Orchard House upside down with preparations for Meg to attend Sally Moffat's coming out.
Myself, I'd sooner have been hung by the neck than attend a fancy ball.
Wait till all of Boston sees you in this dress, Meg.
I told Laurie he has to show you off and keep you from being a wallflower upon penalty of death.
Oh, where is that miserable glove?
Abigail, I shake my head at the way you're managing Margaret.
How is she to be married without a proper debut?
Now, auntie, in our present circumstances--
Your circumstances will not change with your husband's return.
My nephew is as foolish with money as he is in his new philosophies.
The one hope for your family is for Margaret to marry well though I don't know who marries governesses.
Marmee!
And this one has entirely ruined her disposition with books.
Oh, are those for me, Josephine?
No.
Meg's taking them to the Moffats'.
Marmee, Meg's frantic.
She lost her glove and she only has one pair.
Now, she cannot go without gloves.
The Moffats are society.
You're absolutely correct.
Tell Meg she may borrow mine.
Meg, you can take Marmee's!
Oh, dear.
Oh!
- More tea?
- No, thank you.
Sally Moffat, you won't be able to draw your laces.
At my coming out party, I didn't eat for weeks beforehand.
Oh, Meg, I do like that color on you.
It's just like forget-me-nots.
The nicest I've seen that kind of fabric since the war broke out.
But you had it made up so plain.
Well, I do my own sewing, and--
Mrs. Finster's on Charles Street carries silk pieces ready-made.
- Tomorrow I'll take you there.
- Marches haven't bought silk in years.
They have views on slavery.
Meg, isn't it true that your father's school had to close when he admitted a little dark girl?
The silk of Mrs. Finster's isn't milled in the South.
- It's made right here, over in Linfield.
- This isn't China silk?
They use little children for labor.
All the silk mills do.
The poor are always with us.
You are so good to remind us.
May I tell you something?
This is an afternoon dress.
I'm going to make you my pet.
Hortense?
Tonight, Miss March shall have as many conquests as she likes.
You have no corset.
Come on.
- No, thank you.
- Yes, it's charming.
- Not for me, thank you.
- I believe the next dance is the polka.
- With me.
- I would dance with you, Mr. Parker but I fear for my new slippers.
My credo is, "Don't tread on me."
Miss March.
I thought your family were temperance people.
Laurie.
- What was that?
- No, no, don't cover up.
There may be one or two gentlemen here who haven't seen all of your charms.
And I did promise Jo I would show you off.
The girls dressed me up, and I rather like it.
Yes, well, it reveals a whole new Meg.
What do you call this?
Meg.
I'm sorry.
Please don't tell Jo how I've behaved.
Of course not.
If you won't tell anyone how I've behaved.
I was only playing a part to see how it felt to be Belle Gardiner with four proposals and 20 pairs of gloves.
You're worth 10 of those other girls.
Did you see the way this March girl has gone after the Laurence heir?
Best thing that could happen to the Marches.
Oh!
This ridiculous dress.
I've been tripping over it all night.
Tie something around your neck where it could do you some good.
I don't like people speculating about Laurie and our Meg as if they were characters in some play.
Heh, heh.
And nothing provokes speculation more than the sight of a woman enjoying herself.
Why is it Laurie may do as he likes, and flirt and tipple champagne--?
And no one thinks the less of him?
Well, I suppose for one practical reason:
Laurie is a man, and as such he may vote, and hold property and pursue any profession he pleases.
And so he is not so easily demeaned.
Why should anyone care what they think?
I do.
It's nice to be praised and admired.
I couldn't help but like it.
Of course not.
I only care what you think of yourself.
If you feel your value lies in being merely decorative I fear that someday you might find yourself believing that's all that you really are.
Time erodes all such beauty.
But what it cannot diminish is the wonderful workings of your mind.
Your humor, your kindness and your moral courage.
These are the things I cherish so in you.
I so wish I could give my girls a more just world.
I know you'll make it a better place.
Hm?
Resounded.
Resounded with song of the nightingale.
With a gush--
With a gush--
No.
No, I don't want them now.
And keep the music.
I won't be going near a piano for ages.
You need your books in college.
Here's your Dombey and Sons.
I could've sworn there was another volume.
Honestly, Jo.
I won't be taking all of Dickens to Harvard with me.
Oh, no.
You'll have much more important things to read.
Nothing's going to change, Jo.
I wish I could go.
I wish you could too.
You'll come back knowing all sorts of things I don't know and then I'll hate you.
Oh.
Well, as it happens I already know something you don't know.
About Meg and a certain former tutor of mine soon to be employed at the firm of Laurence and Laurence.
Liar.
Has Meg mislaid a certain personal article such as a glove?
Meg, John Brooke stole your glove.
What glove?
Not my white one?
Brooke's had it forever.
Laurie says he keeps it in his pocket.
You must tell him to return it.
Hannah, don't you think he ought to give it back?
It isn't what I think that matters.
Jo?
Meg?
It's a telegram from Washington Hospital.
Your father's been wounded.
- Come on, Amy.
That's it.
- There are six.
The household account is in this ledger.
It should see you through to the end of the month.
- Of course.
Don't worry about us.
- Oh, Beth?
Dear, look in on the Hummels for me, will you?
I will, Marmee.
Where's Jo?
It's almost 6.
Doing battle with Aunt March for Marmee's railway ticket.
Amy, would you carry a letter to Mrs. Juba at the Hope House?
John.
Mr. Brooke.
I've come to offer myself as an escort to your mother.
Cook packed this up, and grandfather sends a bottle of spirits for Mr. March.
- Oh, that's lovely, Laurie.
Thank you.
- Marmee.
- Mr. Brooke is here.
- Mrs. March.
Mr. Brooke.
As young Laurence no longer requires a tutor Mr. Laurence has commissions for me in Washington.
I should like to be of service to you there.
- We couldn't let you travel alone.
- Oh, Mr. Brooke, how kind of you.
- May I?
Are we to go on the 6:00 train?
- Thank you.
- Yes, I sent Jo off, but she hasn't re--
- I'm here!
Jo.
Finally.
Twenty-five.
Can Aunt March spare this?
I couldn't bear to ask her.
- I sold my hair.
- Jo, how could you?
- Your one beauty.
- It won't affect the state of the union.
- It'll grow back.
- It suits you.
Tell Father that we love him.
- Tell him we pray for him.
- Bring him home.
- I'll never forget his kindness.
- Oh, Hannah, thank you.
Oh, I shall miss my little women.
Are you thinking about Father?
No.
My hair.
Aww....
- Harder.
- Yeah, I hit him on the noggin.
Wait for me!
Blast!
Oh, dear.
- This stove.
- We'll eat them anyway.
There's no more cornmeal nor coffee.
The grocer won't let us have any more on account.
- What can I bring the Hummels?
- Oh, fry the Hummels.
- You spent hours there last week.
- The boys are sick.
I mustn't write of this to Marmee.
- She has enough burdens now.
- I hate money.
Your potatoes!
Come on!
Here!
Air the beds.
And be careful cleaning.
- And don't forget your studies, Amy.
- I won't.
I will.
Go!
- Beth.
- Christine.
I don't understand.
I brought you a potato.
Laurie's home for the weekend!
In need of funds, no doubt.
We'd have a week's groceries with what he spends on billiards.
Oh, Jehoshaphat.
Meg!
Meg, you won't believe it!
I've sold The Lost Duke of Gloucester!
Five whole dollars!
I'm an author!
Beth?
The Hummel baby is sick.
I feel so strange.
She's burning up, but she says that she's freezing.
She has a terrible thirst, but she won't drink.
Sounds like Arsenicum, but she looks more like belladonna.
I saw the Hummels.
Two children taken up to Jesus.
Scarlet fever.
You and Miss Jo won't be harmed.
You had it when you were babies.
But, Miss Amy, we have to send you away.
She won't die.
Will she, Laurie?
God wouldn't let her die.
I don't wanna go away.
I'll come and see you every day.
I swear it.
You won't be alone.
I'm afraid of Aunt March.
If she's unkind to you...
- ...
I'll come and take you away.
- Where will we go?
Paris?
If I get scarlet fever and die give Meg my box with the green doves on it.
- And Jo must have my turquoise ring.
- I'll see to that.
I don't wanna die.
I've never even been kissed.
I've waited my whole life to be kissed.
And what if I miss it?
I tell you what.
I promise to kiss you before you die.
Whoa.
I don't know.
I don't think Marmee should leave Father.
Beth needs Marmee.
She depends on her.
But what if we send for her and Father gets worse?
How in the name of all that's holy would we pay for the train?
"That he profane not my sancteraries--"
- Sanctuary.
- "Sanctuaries.
For I, the Lord, do sanctify them.
And Moses told it unto Aaron and to his sons and unto all the children of Israel."
Go on.
"And the Lord spake unto Moses saying--"
Jo, Mr. Laurence is here.
If we may, I wish my personal physician, Dr. Bangs to examine the little girl.
There's nothing to be done.
If I bleed her, it would finish her.
- Best to send for the mother.
- Forgive me.
I've already done so.
Mrs. March arrives on the train this night.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed--
Jo!
Cricket.
Marmee's here.
Icy cold.
Jo.
Jo, fetch a basin with vinegar water and some rags.
Meg, my kit.
Must draw the fever down from her head.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right now.
That's my love.
Beth.
And so our dear Beth came back to us although the fever had weakened her heart forever.
We did not know then that a shadow had fallen.
We prepared for another Christmas without Father.
Try each corner.
Thank you.
No, no!
One bow is enough!
Mr. Laurence.
Thank you.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- It happens all the time.
How's this?
- Here she comes.
- Come on.
Come on.
What should I do with these bows?
Don't scare her to death.
She's been sick, you know.
Hide the chairs.
Just hide them, Amy.
Quick.
- The house is beautiful.
- Ha-ha-ha.
They're friends of mine from college.
Freddy Vaughan and Averill Watson.
They won't bite.
No, don't sit there!
Sit--
Here.
Sit here, child.
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas, Beth!
Merry Christmas, Beth!
I should've given it to you long ago.
It belonged to my little girl who had to leave us when she was very young.
But now it will make music again.
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

That was good.
I fear you would have a long engagement.
Three or four years.
John must secure a house before you can marry.
- And he must do his service to the union.
- John?
Marry?
You mean that pokey old Mr. Brooke?
How did he weasel his way into this family?
Jo.
John has been very kind to go visit Father in the hospital every day.
Oh, he's dull as powder.
Meg, can't you at least marry someone amusing?
I'm fond of Mr. Brooke.
He's a good man.
He's kind and serious.
And I'm not afraid of being poor.
Marmee, you can't just let her go and marry him.
I'd hardly just go and marry anyone.
I would rather Meg marry for love and be a poor man's wife than marry for riches and lose her self-respect.
So you don't mind that John is poor?
No, but I would rather he have a house.
Why must we marry at all?
Why can't things just stay as they are?
It is only a proposal.
Nothing need be decided.

Father!
Oh, Father, you're home!
Oh!

- Ha!
Oh, you're more handsome than ever.
Beth, my little cricket.
- Thank God you're well.
- Clear the way.
- Give the man room to breathe.
- Jo!
Oh, my wild girl!
Well, this could become the fashion.
- Watch his arm.
- I'm not used to this.
- Be careful.
- Be very careful now.
- Don't coddle this soldier too much.
- Oh, now, Father, it's time to coddle.
- Oh, Father!
- Hannah, God bless you.
It's good to see you.
- It's good to have you home.
- Oh!
- Now, let me look at my girls.
- Take them and give them--
The cholera took more men than the rebs, as I understand it, sir.
Agriculture isn't taught, and it should be.
It should be required.
Perhaps the freedmen should be given land in the west.
What happened between you and John Brooke?
Never you mind.
- Isn't it wonderful, Jo?
- Yes, it's wonderful.

So you feel our Amy has talent?
Oh, Miss March excels at drawing.
But, you know, her landscapes lack emotion.
I definitely feel Amy would benefit from further study.
- But she won't get it around here.
- Where do you suggest?
Cape Cod has a fine artist colony.
But Europe, Europe is the best place.
Teddy!
Teddy!
Your houseman said you wouldn't be home till night.
I couldn't wait so long.
Hail the conquering graduate.
- Is grandfather exceedingly proud?
- Yes.
And exceedingly bent on locking me up in one of his offices.
Why is it Amy may paint China and you can scribble away while I must manfully set my music aside?
Why must you?
If I don't, I'd have to defy Grandfather.
Yes, and not the whole of society.
- I can't go against the old man.
- Oh....
When I imagine myself in that life I can think of only one thing that would make me happy.
Oh, no.
Teddy-
- Teddy, don't.
No, wait, Teddy.
We have to talk about this reasonably.
I have loved you since the moment I clamped eyes on you.
What could be more reasonable than to marry you?
- We'd kill each other.
- Nonsense!
- Neither of us can keep our temper.
- I can.
Unless provoked.
We're both stupidly stubborn, especially you.
We'd only quarrel.
I wouldn't!
You can't even propose without quarreling.
Jo.
Dear Jo.
I swear I'll be a saint.
I'll let you win every argument.
Heh, heh.
I'll take care of you and your family.
I'll give you every luxury you've ever been denied.
You won't have to write.
Unless you want to.
Grandfather wants me to learn the business in England.
Can't you see us bashing around London?
London.
Oh, Teddy, I'm not fashionable enough for London.
You need someone who's elegant and refined.
I want you.
Teddy, please don't ask me.
- Teddy, I'm desperately sorry.
- No, don't.
- I do care for you.
- No.
With all of my heart.
You're my dearest friend.
I just can't go be a wife.
You say you won't, but you will.
- I won't.
I won't.
- One day you'll meet some man.
A good man.
And you will love him tremendously.
And you will live and die for him.
- Teddy, please.
- You will.
Jo.
I know you.
And I'll be hanged if I stand by and watch.
Jo, are you ill?
She has refused Laurie.
Well, I'm sure she can take it back.
It's just a misunderstanding.
No.
No.
Oh, listen to him.
I must get away.
Of course.
Aunt March is going to France.
France!
That's ideal!
I'll put up with anything to go!
Jo, Aunt March has asked me to go.
To Europe?
My Europe?
When?
It was decided just today.
Well, I am her companion now.
She wishes me to study painting abroad and hopes I might make a good match there.
Oh....
But perhaps she wouldn't mind if you stayed at Plumfield while we are gone.
Of course Aunt March prefers Amy over me.
Why shouldn't she?
I'm ugly and awkward, and I always say the wrong things.
I fly around throwing away perfectly good marriage proposals.
I love our home, but I'm just so fitful, and I can't stand being here.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Marmee.
There's just something really wrong with me.
I want to change, but I....
I can't.
- And I just know I'll never fit in anywhere.
- Oh, Jo.
Jo, you have so many extraordinary gifts.
How can you expect to lead an ordinary life?
You're ready to go out and find a good use for your talent.
Although, I don't know what I shall do without my Jo.
Go and embrace your liberty.
And see what wonderful things come of it.
Laurie sought his refuge in London and abroad.
Marmee helped me find a place in the great city of New York.
So I stepped over the divide between childhood and all that lay beyond.
Mrs. Kirk?
Josephine.
Yes.
How do you do?
Kitty, Minnie!
This is Miss March.
Her father was Colonel March.
He knew your papa.
It was cold!
Watch your feet, Mr. Costigan.
- Oh, do come in, my dear.
- Oh, you're making that up.
Dear Beth.
Marmee's friend, Mrs. Kirk, has made me feel quite at home.
My little students, Kitty and Minnie, are dear girls.
How curious to grow up in a busy boardinghouse with no father and your own mother the innkeeper.
I felt bold on leaving Concord.
But I confess I find New York rough and strange and myself strange in it.
Can you pass these down the table?
Thank you kindly, professor.
Mrs. Kirk believes that I am here for a brief interlude of sensational experience before succumbing to a matrimonial fate.
Excuse me, miss.
And while there's surely no lack of sensational experience of every kind available in such a city...
Come in!
...I hope, though I've had no luck yet that any experience I gain here will be strictly literary.
And that all events of a romantic or sensational nature will be entirely confined to the page.
Our subscribers are not interested in sentiment and fairy stories, miss.
They're not fairy stories.
Try one of the ladies' magazines.
- Come on, Will.
Hurry up!
- I'm coming!
- I'm so sorry.
I'm so clumsy.
- Oh, no.
No.
You know that when first I saw you, I thought:
"Ah!
She is a writer."
What made you think so?
Oh.
Heh.
Yes, I know many writers.
Uh, in Berlin I was--
I was professor at the university.
Here, I am just a humble tutor, I'm afraid.
No, please.
Sit down.
Thank you.
You are far from home, Miss March.
Do you miss your family?
Oh, very much.
My sisters especially.
And Laurie.
She is your sister?
Ah.
Oh, no.
He's a friend.
Do you like your coffee?
Oh, it's just very strong.
I like it.
You have quite a library.
Did you bring all these books from Germany?
A few of them.
- May I?
- Of course.
Most of these I could not bear to leave behind.
I sold everything that I owned to get my passage to come here but my books, never.
Oh....
Shakespeare.
Some books are so familiar.
Reading them is like being home again.
Will you be, uh, returning to Berlin, Professor Bhaer?
- Friedrich.
Call me Friedrich.
- Friedrich.
No.
Uh, sadly the fatherland of Goethe and Schiller...
- ...is no more.
- I adore Goethe.
My father used to read me all the German poets...
- ...when I was a child.
- Really?
That is most surprising.
Well, my mother and father were part of a rather unusual circle in Concord.
Do you know the word transcendentalist?
But this is German Romantic philosophy!
We throw off all our constraints and we come to know ourselves through insight and experience.
But it got out of fashion now.
Heh.
Well, not in the March family, I'm afraid.
It's just that with all of this transcendence...
Ah.
This gives you a problem?
I'm hopelessly flawed.
If only we could transcend ourselves without perfection like your poet Walt Whitman who rides up and down the streets of Broadway all day shouting poetry against the roar of the carts.
Keep your silent woods, O, Nature.
- And your quiet places by the river--
- And your quiet places by the woods.
- By the woods.
- Woods.
Yes.
- Give me the streets of Manhattan.
- Give me the streets of Manhattan.
I think we are all hopelessly flawed.
He is as poor as one might imagine an itinerant philosopher to be.
Yet, as the weeks go by, I see that he is unfailingly generous to all of us who live in the house.
I am grateful to have a friend.
It's the system our nation was founded on.
Come now.
It was nothing short of a betrayal of our country's ideals.
Our country's ideals?
A constitution that denies the basic rights of citizenship to women and black people?
They just passed the 15th Amendment, Jacob.
They can vote.
Black men can vote, Charles.
A lady has no need of suffrage if she has a husband.
No, no.
- You don't take wine?
- Only medicinally.
- Well, pretend that you've got a cold.
- I agree.
But if women are a moral force, shouldn't they have the right to govern and preach, and testify in court?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What is it, Miss March?
I find it poor logic to say that because women are good women should vote.
Men do not vote because they are good.
They vote because they are male.
And women should vote, not because they are angels and men are animals but because we are human beings and citizens of this country.
You should've been a lawyer, Miss March.
I should have been a great many things, Mr. Mayer.
Friedrich.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, please.
Please.
Come in.
I have some good news.
A newspaper has published two of my stories, and they wish to see more.
- This is wonderful.
- Right there.
The Daily Volcano.
"The Sinner's Corpse" by Joseph March.
- Heh.
- Mm.
Lunatics.
Vampires.
This....
This interests you?
Well, people like thrilling stories, Friedrich.
This is what the newspapers want.
Yes.
Yes, I suppose.
I suppose that is true.
Yes.
Well, it'll buy a new coat for Beth, and I'm sure she'll be grateful to have it.
Jo, pl--
Oh....
I....
I do not want to be your teacher.
No, understand me.
I am saying only that you should please yourself.
My opinion is of no importance.
Do you forgive me?
- Well, of course.
- Can I make a gift?
An experience.
Do you like the opera?
Oh, I do.
I mean, I think I do.
We don't seem to get a lot of opera in Concord.
Well, I don't have an opera dress.
You will be perfect.
Where we are sitting we shall not be so, uh, formal.
Leila is a goddess.
She has made a promise never to love.
If she breaks her vow, all will be lost.
Oh, look.
Trouble is coming.
What's going to happen?
The inevitable.
Leila....
Leila's soul is opening.
She's drawn to an idea.
He says, "Love has a fatal power."
"Your heart understood mine.
In the depth of the fragrant night I listened with ravished soul to your beloved voice.
Your heart understood mine."
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Oh, Laurie!
You wicked....
We heard you were in Greece or somewhere.
Laurie.
Come, come.
You've been much occupied with business, I am sure.
I'm not pursuing business just now.
Grandfather agreed I should concentrate on my music for a while.
- You know Fred Vaughan.
- Freddy.
- Good day, Laurence.
- Yes.
And I see you've taken up a passion for art, Freddy.
- Aunt March.
You look splendid.
- I cannot say the same for you, my boy.
Amy, dear, will you be long?
I must retire.
Yes, Aunt March.
Do come see us.
- Are they engaged?
- Not yet.
Hop, hop, one, two, three, four.
- Hop, hop, hop, turn.
- Hop, hop, hop, turn.
Friedrich, how long would it take strychnine to dissolve in brandy--?
Oh....
About eight minutes?
And is a dagger worn at the waist, or is that a saber?
I think that in these novels the dagger is usually concealed in the boot by a man with a dark mustache.
Go this way.
Hurry, hurry.
Ah....
Well....
Oh, Laurie, how lovely.
It isn't what it should be...
- ...but you have improved it.
- Please don't.
I liked you much better when you were blunt and natural.
It did not serve me well.
I find you changed.
In fact, I despise you.
You laze about, spending your family's money and courting women.
You aren't serious about music.
My compositions are like your paintings.
Mediocre copies of another man's genius.
Then why don't you go to Grandfather in London and make yourself useful?
I should.
Why don't you reform me?
I've someone more practical in mind.
You do not love Fred Vaughan.
Fred Vaughan is stable and well-mannered--
And has 40,000 a year.
I've always known I would not marry a pauper.
I expect a proposal any day.
You'll regret it.
I'll regret it.
I'm reminded of a promise.
Didn't I say I would kiss you before you die?
Do you hear from Jo?
She has befriended a German professor.
Yes, well, no doubt he's showing her the ways of the world.
I do not wish to be courted by someone who is still in love with my sister.
I'm not in love with Jo.
- Then how do you explain your jealousy?
- I envy her happiness.
I envy his happiness.
I envy John Brooke for marrying Meg.
I hate Fred Vaughan.
And if Beth had a lover, I would despise him too.
Just as you have always known you would never marry a pauper I have always known I should be part of the March family.
I do not wish to be loved for my family.
Any more than Fred Vaughan wishes to be loved for his 40,000 a year.
My darling Amy.
It is you I want and not your family.
I've gone to London to make myself worthy of you.
Please, do not do anything we shall regret.
Monsieur Vaughan, mademoiselle, may I show him in?
- Friedrich, did you read it?
- Yes.
It's, um....
Oh, it's well-written, Jo.
And a first novel.
What a great accomplishment.
Well, I'm going to be showing it to your publisher friend, Mr. Fields, today.
He liked "The Sinner's Corpse."
What is it?
Mr. Fields is a good man.
He will--
He will give you an honest opinion.
Oh, I see.
What is your honest opinion?
I'm a professor of philosophy, Jo.
No, I'd really like to know what you think.
You sh-- You should be writing from life from the depths of your soul.
There is nothing in here of the woman that I am privileged to know.
- Friedrich, this is what I write.
- Ahem.
My apologies if it fails to live up to your high standards.
Jo, there is more to you than this if you have the courage to write it.
Meg!
Jo?
Jo!
Oh, Meg!
Oh, why didn't you tell me?
Well, one hardly speaks of such things.
Oh, how wonderful.
- How is Beth?
- You will find her much altered.
Marmee.
She wouldn't let us send for you sooner.
The doctor has been here a number of times but it's beyond all of us, and I think....
I think she's been waiting for you before--
Drink up all this good broth.
- I'm glad you're home.
- So am I.
"Mr. Pickwick changed color. 'Ah,' said Mr. Wartle.
'Well, that's important.
There's nothing suspicious then, I suppose."'
I feel stronger with you close by.
I'm gonna get you better yet.
If God wants me with him, there is none who will stop him.
I don't mind.
I was never like the rest of you making plans about the great things I'd do.
I never saw myself as anything much.
Not a great writer like you.
Oh, Beth.
I'm not a great writer.
But you will be.
Oh, Jo, I've missed you so.
Why does everyone want to go away?
I love being home.
But I don't like being left behind.
Now I am the one going ahead.
I am not afraid.
I can be brave like you.
But I know I shall be homesick for you, even in heaven.
Oh, Beth.
No.
I won't let you go.
Oh, my Jo.
"Aunt March is bedridden and would not survive a sea voyage.
Amy must bide her time and return later."
It's just as well.
Will we never all be together again?
- Lovely morning.
- Good morning.
Thank you, sir.
Dearest Laurie.
You may not have heard our sad news of Beth.
"Meg has entered her confinement and poor Amy must stay in Vevey with Aunt March."
This is far too great a sorrow to bear alone.
Please come home to us, Teddy dear.
Your faithful, Jo.
Oh, Laurie.
I knew you would come.
The real charm of it lay in Beth's happy face as she leaned over the new piano and lovingly touched the beautiful black and white keys.
During the next few minutes, the rumor circulated that Amy March had got 24 delicious limes.
I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you that they powdered and squeezed, and made me look a fashion plate.
As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet.
A general outcry arose, for all her abundant hair was cut short.
Jo, how could you?
Your one beauty.
Nothing's going to change, Jo.

Surprise!
John, you have a daughter.
And a son.
Oh, Marmee, I can't believe you did this four times.
Yes but never two at once, my darling.
Oh, Daisy.
Oh, Meg.
She's so beautiful.
And him.
He is handsome.
He's gonna look just like his papa when he grows up.
Yes, he does look like John.
Have you heard from the professor?
No.
No.
We did not part well.
Well, John and I don't always agree, but then we mend it.
Who could that be?
- Jo!
- Teddy!
- Oh, this is magic!
- You are absolutely--
Covered in flour.
Oh, dear!
Come in.
No, Jo, not yet.
May I tell you something without the others?
You're my dear friend.
- I'm glad you shall be the first to know.
- Heh, heh, heh.
What?
May I present my wife.
Jo.
Oh!
Amy.
Oh, my.
- Here.
Flowers.
Oh, you're so--
- Thank you.

I went to Europe to paint the great cathedrals but I couldn't get our home out of my mind.
Oh, look how Amy has captured Orchard House.
- Look.
- Lovely.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Not as beautiful as I wanted, but I am still learning.
Dear little angel.
Jo, you must tell me the truth as a sister which is a relation stronger than marriage.
- Do you mind at all?
- Oh....
Oh, no.
I was surprised.
Mind you, I had it on good authority that our Teddy would never love another, heh, and now he's gone and gotten married.
It's good to hear you call me Teddy again.
At last, we're all family as we always should have been.
You must promise me that you will always live close by.
I couldn't bear losing another sister.
Oh!
Ha-ha-ha.
Jo, it's so gloomy and chilly.
One would require an income just for the coal to heat this place.
What could the dear girl have been thinking?
Most likely she felt sorry for me.
Decrepit homeless spinster.
Jo.
Heh.
Poor aunt, living here all those years alone in this useless old house.
Yes, her blessings became a burden because she couldn't share them.
Wouldn't this have made a wonderful school?
A school.
What a challenge that would be.
Hello, Tuppy.
Hello.
Good boy.
My book.
Someone's publishing my book.
Hannah!
Hannah!
- Someone's publishing my book!
- Heaven help us.
But it came with no letter.
How did it arrive?
Foreign gentleman brung it.
- Strange kind of name.
Can't think of it.
- Hannah!
- Oh, fox or bear or such.
- Bhaer!
Did you ask him to wait?
I thought he was one of Miss Amy's European friends...
I said, "Miss March and Mr. Laurie are living next door."
- Oh, Hannah, you didn't!
- And he said he had a train to catch.
Friedrich!
Oh, Friedrich, thank you for my book.
Well, when I didn't hear from you, I thought you hated it.
Oh, no.
No.
Reading your book was like opening a window into your heart.
James Fields took it out of my hands, and he would not give it back to me.
I said, "Such news I have to give to her myself."
Well, it was....
It was a silly impulse.
No, no.
Not silly at all.
It's so good to see you.
Come and meet my family.
No, I--
Thank you but I have to catch the train.
I-
- I'm going to the west.
My ship leaves from Boston tomorrow morning.
- Oh.
- Yes.
The schools in the west are young.
They need professors and they're not so concerned about the accent.
I don't mind it either.
You see, my aunt left me Plumfield.
It isn't a field.
It's a house, actually.
A rather large house.
And it isn't really good for anything except a school.
And I want a good school one that would be open to anyone who wanted to learn.
And, well, I'll be needing someone who knows how to teach.
Is there nothing I might say to keep you here?
I confess that I was hoping that I might have a reason to stay but congratulations on the celebration of your marriage.
Oh, ha, ha, no.
No.
No, that's Amy.
She's my sister, Amy, and Laurie, actually.
No, I'm-
- Heh.
I'm not married.
Please don't go so far away.
Jo.
Such a little name for such a person.
Will you have me?
With all of my heart.
But I have nothing to give you.
My hands are empty.
Not empty now.
- Is this too fast?
- Harder!
My sisters and I remember that winter... as the coldest of our childhood.
A temporary poverty had settled upon our family some years before.
The war had made fuel and lamp oil scarce.
But necessity is indeed the mother of invention.
Somehow in that dark time... our family, the March family, seemed to create its own light.
Marmee!
Marmee's home!
Marmee!
Marmee!
We waited and waited!
We've been "expectorating" you for hours!
- Have you, my darling?
- " Expecting," featherhead.
- Oh, Marmee, you're frozen!
- Yes.
If you could see the people lined up outside Hope House in this bitter cold.
- Mmm, your cheeks are so warm.
- Finished your Christmas bundles?
So many this year!
We were handing out--
- Oh, how is your cold?
- Better.
Good.
We were handing out food... as quickly as we could make up the baskets.
Now, Miss Amy, what is this in my pocket?
Father!
" My dearest family, I am well and safe.
Our battalion is encamped on the 'Potamac'."
- Potomac.
- Potomac.
" December makes a hard, cold season for all of us so far from home.
I think of my girls day and night... and find my best comfort in your affection.
I pray that your own hardships will not be too great to bear.
Give them all my dear love and a kiss.
Tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night."
- Poor Father.
- I'm a selfish girl.
Oh!
Little ones.
It's Christmas Eve.
Father wouldn't want us to be sad now.
Ding-dong merrily on high
In heaven the bells are ringing
In heaven the bells are ringing
Ding-dong merrily the sky is riven with angels singing
Glor-o-o-ria
Hosanna in excelsis
To bed, Miss Amy.
- Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
- Merry Christmas.
Let steeple bells be swungen
And i-o i-o i-o
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Glor-o-o-ria
Merry Christmas, Beth.
- Love you.
- I love you.
Hosanna in excelsis
My Jo.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Marmee.
Hosanna in excelsis
And don't sit up too late.
I won't.
May you beautifully rhyme your eve-time song ye singers
Late at night, my mind would come alive with voices and stories... and friends as dear to me as any in the real world.
I gave myself up to it, longing for transformation.
Oh, what miraculous food!
Isn't this just like the old days, Hannah?
Oh.
We shouldn't eat it.
We should just look at it.
I'm going to eat it.
Jo?
Jo, come down!
I'm awake!
Horrible piano.
Hannah's put together an absolute Christmas miracle.
Is that sausage?
Wait!
Oh, butter!
Oh, oh, isn't butter "divinity"?
Oh, God, thank you for this breakfast.
Jo, angel, fetch your Marmee.
She went out at the crack of dawn to see some Germans.
Hummel, the boy said.
Not a word of English.
His da's gone.
Six children, and she's 'bout to issue another.
May as well take 'em a stick of firewood.
Sure they haven't got any.
Or breakfast either.
Perhaps we could send the Hummels our bread.
Might as well send the butter too.
Butter's not much use... without bread to put it on.
Oh, wonderful snow!
Don't you wish you could roll about in it like dogs?
Once one of our finest families.
Lovely weather for a picnic!
Come along, Theodore.
We'll be late for church.
Jo, you should let them speak first.
What will they think of us?
Oh, don't look back!
Here we come a-wassailing among the leaves so green
And here we come a-wandering so fair as to be seen
Love and joy come to you And to you your wassail too
And God bless you and send you a happy new year
And God send you a happy new year
"Knights and ladies, elves and pages, monks and flower girls... all mingled gaily in the dance.
Pauline cried out in horror as her bridegroom's mask fell... disclosing not her lover Ferdinand... but the face of his sworn enemy, Count Antonio.
Revenge is mine, quoth he."
Continued in the following edition.
Excellent installment, Mr. Snodgrass.
- Oh, I love forbidden marriages!
- You ought to publish it, Jo.
Really!
Not just in the Pickwick Portfolio.
Mr. Tupman, are you demeaning our fine newspaper?
Mr. Winkle.
"One periwink--" Advertisement.
"One periwinkle sash belonging to Mr. N. Winkle... has been 'abscondated' from the wash line... which gentleman desires any reports leading to its recovery."
Gentlemen of the press, hear, hear!
I call to your attention... our Mr. Tupman's The History of the Squash.
Oh, don't read mine.
Beth, this isn't a story.
It's a recipe.
Oh, dear, I never know what to write.
First rule of writing, Mr. Tupman, is never write what you know.
What do we think of the boy?
Is he a captive like Smee in Nicholas Nickleby?
He looks lonely.
You don't think he'll try to call?
Maybe he has a secret-- a tragic, European secret.
He's had no upbringing at all they say.
He was reared in Italy among artists and vagrants.
Doesn't he have a noble brow?
If I were a boy, I'd want to look just like that.
Imagine giving up Italy to come live with that awful old man!
Jo, please don't say awful.
It's slang.
I'd be terrified to live with him.
I shouldn't mind living in such a fine house and having nice things.
Oh, it doesn't seen like Christmas this year without presents.
I'm desperate for drawing pencils.
I wish I didn't have to work for Great-Aunt March... that crabby old miser.
And you, Beth.
What's your Christmas wish?
I'd like the war to end so Father can come home.
Oh, sweet Beth.
We all want that.
They do have a beautiful piano.
Wait 'til I'm a writer.
I'll buy you the best piano in creation.
And if she doesn't, you can come over and play mine.
When I marry, I'm going to be disgustingly rich.
And what if the man you love is a poor man but good, like Father?
Well, it isn't like being stuck with the dreadful nose you get.
One does have a choice to whom one loves.
You have a lovely nose!
I wouldn't marry for the money.
I mean, what if his business goes bust?
Besides, down at the Eagle, they pay $5 for each story they print.
Why, I have ten stories in my head right now!
Gentlemen, I dislike all this money talk.
It isn't refined.
If lack of attention to personal finances is a mark of refinement... then I'd say the Marches are the most elegant family in Concord.
We'll all grow up someday, Meg.
We might as well know what we want.
That'll do.
Put the carriage away, and look smart about it.
Very good, sir.
Merry Christmas!
I have the most wonderful feeling about tonight.
Meg and Jo, you have to tell me...
"exquisitely" everything about Belle Gardiner.
What her nose looks like and about her ring.
Annie Gardiner says it's an emerald.
Can you imagine?
Everyone's lucky but me.
I'm glad I don't have to go and be with those frightening people... and try to think of things to say.
- Hush now.
- Oh, mind you, Jo... don't eat much at supper... and don't shake hands with people.
It isn't the thing anymore.
- Jo, your dress!
- Oh, I know!
You always stand too close to the fire.
Oh, dear.
Well, just keep your backside to the wall.
- Meg, look.
What cunning little heels.
- They're rather small.
That's all right.
It's only for one night.
You don't suppose anyone will notice... they came out of the rag bag, do you?
Uh-uh.
You have to have heels.
What's that strange smell?
Like burnt feathers.
- Heavens above!
- You've ruined me!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have had me do it!
- Meg, don't worry.
- I spoil everything.
- I can't go out like this!
- Good!
I'm not going either.
Here, we'll place my bow in front.
- Yes, that covers it.
- It's very becoming.
I'll never have any suitors.
I'll just be a dried-up old spinster.
You don't need scores of suitors.
You only need one, if he's the right one.
Listen to the child.
Meg isn't going to be married right away, is she?
With Jo's help, I never will.
- You must be so happy.
- Oh, Belle, it's enchanting.
Well, I best go help Mama.
Excuse me.
I think it's Mrs. Barkley.
She's going to try it.
Watch her.
Oh, yes, I would like it very much.
Jehoshaphat!
I'm sorry.
No, no, stay!
It's not a bad hiding place.
You see, I don't know anyone... so I feel awkward standing and staring at people.
Should I put on my jacket?
I never know the rules.
Um, um, I'm Laurie.
Theodore Laurence, but I'm, uh, I'm called Laurie.
Jo March.
Um--
So, who were you staring at?
Uh, you, actually.
What-- what game were you playing?
I don't know, but I think I won.
- Who else?
- Well, I was--
I was quite taken with that one.
That's Meg.
That's my sister.
She's completely bald in front.
Is it true that you lived in Italy among artists and vagrants?
My mother was Italian.
A, uh, pianist.
- Grandfather disapproved of her.
- Truly?
I saw a play like that once.
Do you like the theater?
- Oh, yes.
- Were you born there?
Where?
In-- In, uh, Italy.
- Do you speak French or Italian?
- English at home.
Francais a L 'ecole.
The Music Conservatory in Vevey.
But Grandfather's having me tutored now.
He insists I go to college.
Oh, I'd commit murder to go to college.
Ohh!
Actually, I'm going to Europe.
Well, at least I hope I am.
My Great-Aunt March says she'll go one of these days... and she has to take me with her because I work as her companion.
I have to read to her for hours and hours.
- But I do all the voices!
- I'll bet you do.
If I weren't going to be a writer...
I'd go to New York and pursue the stage.
- Are you shocked?
- Very.
I-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Meg always makes me take the gentleman's part at home.
It's a shame you don't know the lady's part.
Why are you looking at the back of my dress?
It isn't so bad!
Honestly.
You promised you wouldn't look.
Oh, Jo, I've sprained my ankle.
I shouldn't wonder in those shoes!
Does it hurt?
Oh.
Oh, no, no.
I'm quite well, thank you.
Well, this is our neighbor, Laurie, the captive.
Oh, poor Meg.
I'll go tell Mrs. Gardiner.
Oh, no, Jo.
She'll think I've been sampling the punch.
- A perfectly good party ruined.
- I have my carriage.
Let me take you home.
- Oh, yes!
- Oh, no, thank you.
Thank you.
Lean on me.
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.
That's very kind of you.
- Good-bye, Laurie.
- Good night, Mrs. March.
Wherever did you get this shoe?
Did you ride in his carriage?
Oh, you two have all the luck.
- Oh, Jo, is he very romantic?
- Not in the slightest!
We're very much obliged to him, but he's a dreadful boy.
He did a good deed putting snow on this ankle.
- He put snow on your ankle?
- To bed, Miss Amy.
- With his own hands?
- Oh, stop being so swoony.
I won't have my girls being silly about boys.
To bed, Jo, dear.
Does this hurt?
- Everything lovely happens to Meg.
- Oh, yes indeed!
You mustn't be soppy about Laurie anymore than you should be soppy... about those silly girls at school.
I hope we shall be good friends with him.
- With a boy?
- He isn't a boy!
He's Laurie!
Faster!
Faster!
Laurie!
Your young ladies are unusually active, Mrs. March, if I may say so.
You may indeed, Mr. Brooke.
It is my opinion that young girls are no different than boys... in their need for exertion.
Feminine weakness and fainting spells are the direct result... of our confining young girls to the house... bent over their needlework in restrictive corsets.
Marmee!
Your young student is an athlete.
He is, thank you, a good one.
But he makes an unruly scholar.
I regret that his grandfather is away much.
One hopes that your girls... will be a gentling influence.
Indeed, Mr. Brooke.
Marmee, must you speak to everyone about corsets?
Oh, Meg.
Do I?
Blast these wretched skirts!
Don't say blast and wretch.
Amy, don't be such a ninny-pinny.
I wish I was Beth so I could stay home and do pleasant things.
Oh, if you call doing laundry and housework pleasant!
Blast!
Amy, hurry.
I'll be late for work.
There's Mrs. King.
I'm tardy again.
Lovely children.
Oh, Meg, must I go to school?
I'm so "degradatated."
I can hardly hold my head up.
I owe at least a dozen limes.
- Limes?
- Are limes the fashion now?
Of course they are.
It's nothing but limes now.
Everyone keeps them in their desks and trades them for beads and things.
And all the girls treat each other at recess.
If you don't bring limes to school, you're nothing.
You might as well be dead.
I've had ever so many limes, and I can't pay anyone back.
No wonder you don't learn anything at that school!
I know how it feels to do without any little luxuries.
But we are not destitute, not yet.
Here's a quarter.
Marmee gave me the rag money this month.
Go on!
"Secondly, the immortality of the soul... is asserted to be in consequence... of its immateriality... as in all leipothymic cases... consistent with the idea of immortality... and immorality, and physicality--"
And I think you finally dozed off.
Josephine, there's a draft!
Is it Father?
Teacher struck me.
He put the limes out into the snow.
May Chester said my limes must have been donated to Hope House.
Then I said that she wouldn't get a single lime from me.
And then she told Mr. Davis they were hidden in my desk... and then he struck me.
We oughta go over there and beat the tar out of him with his own stick!
Jo, we must not embrace violence.
- I'll write this man a letter.
- A letter?
That'll show him.
You failed to mention to me they were forbidden.
A whole month's rag money?
- Amy, I shouldn't have given it to you.
- I'm sorry!
All those lovely limes.
I'm perfectly "desolated."
I'm not sorry you lost them.
It's a frivolous concern in times like these.
You are more intent upon reshaping your dear little nose... than in fashioning your character.
It's an appalling school.
Your spelling's atrocious... your Latin absurd.
Mr. Davis said it was as useful to educate a woman... as to educate a female cat.
I shall strangle Mr. Davis!
" Mr. Davis... what right have you to strike a child?
In God's eyes we are all children and we are all equals.
If you hit and humiliate a child, the only lesson she will learn... is to hit and humiliate."
Amy, do you think you can discipline yourself... to learn at home as Beth has done?
"I withdraw my daughter Amy from your school."
It serves the scoundrel right!
Jo will now supervise your education.
Jo, tell me what happens next... after the Duke turns his back on his family fortune and saves Lady Zara.
Don't know.
It's all murder and gore.
The damsel's in distress.
Oh, I love your damsels in distress.
Oh, Beth, truly, I don't know if I could ever be good like Marmee.
I rather crave violence.
If only I could be like Father... and go to war and stand up to the lions of injustice.
And so Marmee does in her own way.
Yes.
But I want to do something different!
I don't know what it is yet, but I'm on the watch for it.
You will find it, Jo.
Hello!
Jo!
Come over here.
You too, Meg.
It's dull as tombs around here.
Mr. Laurence, one doesn't shout at ladies as if they were cattle.
My apologies.
All right.
What do those girls do over there all day?
Over the mysteries of female life... there is drawn a veil best left undisturbed.
Oh, dear Countess, pray for me... for I have sinned against meself and me brother Rodrigo.
You've got to say sinned as if you've really sinned!
Sinned!
Sinned!
Rodrigo!
You arrive seeking the Duke of Lankershire.
Hark ye.
Who goes there?
Oh, I forgot the cymbals.
Why it's...
it's Rodrigo!
- Rodrigo?
- I want to be Lady Violet.
I'm "exhaustified" of being the boy.
The play is the thing, Amy!
You're too little to be Lady Violet.
Here, be the Countess de Montanescu.
- You don't have any lines.
- Besides who would be our Rodrigo?
Gentlemen...
I propose the admission of a new member to our theatrical society.
Theodore Laurence.
We'll put it to a vote.
Nay.
He'll laugh at our acting and poke fun at us later.
He'll think it's only a game.
No, he won't.
Upon my word as a gentleman.
Jo, when it's only ladies, we don't guard our conduct in the same way.
We bear our souls and tell the most appalling secrets.
- He would find us improper.
- Teddy would do nothing of the sort.
Oh, please?
Let's try him.
Shall we?
- Jo!
- Traitor!
Fellow artists, may I present myself... as an actor, a musician, and a loyal and very humble servant of the club.
We'll be the judge of that.
In token of my gratitude, and as a means of promoting... communication between adjoining nations... shouting from windows being forbidden, I shall provide... a post office in our hedge... to further encourage the baring of our souls... and the telling of our most appalling secrets.
I do pledge... never to reveal what I receive in confidence here.
Well then... do take your place, Rodrigo.
Sir...
Rodrigo.
And so Laurie was admitted as an equal into our society... and we March girls could enjoy the daily novelty... of having a real brother of our very own.
I want to go to the theater.
- I never get to go anywhere.
- You're too little.
Beth, where in tarnation are Marmee's opera glasses?
I'm not too little.
You're just hogging Laurie.
Please, can't I go?
Oh, Amy, I'm afraid Laurie only reserved four seats.
Do I look too shabby?
Oh, Jehoshaphat, Meg, this isn't a coronation.
It's just Laurie and that awful Mr. Brooke.
Jo, can't you ask Teddy to get another ticket?
No!
You have a cold, dear.
Rest your eyes.
Evangeline and I will make you some ginger tea.
You're weeks behind in algebra.
Do all the pages that I've marked.
I won't have a sister who's a lazy ignoramus.
- Don't sulk.
You look like a pigeon.
- Coo!
Coo!
Good night.
You'll be sorry for this, Jo March!
Whoa!
Whoa, there.
Thank you.
Oh, Mrs. Nell Watson.
Wasn't she a wonderful swooner?
If only I were the swooning type!
If only I were the catching type.
Young Laurence informs me... you are an aficionado of the theater, Miss March.
- Well, I-
- I enjoy reading plays.
- Yes.
I, I find it most pleasurable myself.
Though I confess I'm distracted at the theater... thinking of the peculiar lives of the actors themselves.
When one considers the immodesties Mrs. Nell Watson suffers... one wonders what sort of lady would seek such a life.
Meg is a sensational actress!
We're always putting on wild theatricals.
It's just something that we play at.
Well, as, as a matter of fact... at school I engaged in debating.
What do you think of that?
Let's see what they do.
- I had a wonderful time, Mr. Brooke.
- As did I.
It was a most delightful evening.
- And I'd very much like--
- Thank you very much.
Good night.
- Oh, good night.
- Good night.
- That was rude.
- You plastered yourself on him.
It's proper to take a gentleman's arm if it's offered.
How was the theater?
Amusing?
It was wonderful!
I was absolutely inspired by the love scene.
You look flushed, Meg dear.
Was the theater overcrowded?
Still sulking?
Beth, where did I put my manuscript?
Beth?
No!
Oh, no.
I didn't do it!
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!
Marmee, help me!
I'm gonna kill you!
Do you hear me?
- How can you do this to me?
- Jo!
- Jo, stop.
You're hurting her.
- Marmee!
- Marmee!
- Jo!
Jo!
Let go of her!
- What's happened?
All right, all right.
- I hate you!
No, Jo!
Don't touch it.
Come.
Just let it go.
You're dead!
You're nothing!
I never want to see you again!
It is a very great loss, and you have every right to be put out.
But don't let the sun go down upon your anger.
Forgive each other.
Begin again tomorrow, huh?
I will never forgive her.
I'm sorry, Jo.
Looks like the last ice we'll have this year.
Say "go."
Laurie, Jo, wait for me!
Ignore her.
Ready-
- Blast!
Jo, please!
- Amy!
- Jo!
Hold on.
I'm coming!
Hold on, Amy.
Get a rail!
Grab the stick, Amy.
- Grab it!
- Come on!
Hold on!
There we go.
That's it, that's it.
Josephine March, you walked all the way from Walden Pond...
- in only these bloomers?
- As if she even noticed.
Dear Amy.
How could I have been so horrible?
Thank God for Laurie.
Jo, do you love Laurie more than you love me?
Oh, don't be such a beetle!
I could never love anyone as I love my sisters.
I'm not a beetle.
Oh, look out.
You're leaving out the best part.
When Lady Zara succumbs to the Duke's rival.
Oh, right, yes!
Sir Hugo.
I quite prefer him myself.
In the spring, we turned Orchard House upside down... with preparations for Meg to attend Sally Moffat's coming out.
Myself, I'd sooner have been hung by the neck than attend a fancy ball.
Wait 'til all of Boston sees you in this dress, Meg.
I told Laurie he has to show you off and keep you from being a wallflower... upon penalty of death.
Oh, where is that miserable glove?
Abigail, I shake my head at the way you're managing Margaret.
How is she to be married without a proper debut?
Now, Auntie, in our present circumstances--
Your circumstances will not change with your husband's return.
My nephew is as foolish with money as he is in his new philosophies.
The one hope for your family is for Margaret to marry well... though I don't know who marries governesses.
Marmee!
And this one has entirely ruined her disposition with books.
Oh, are those for me, Josephine?
No.
Meg's taking them to the Moffat's.
Marmee, Meg's frantic.
She lost her glove, and she only has one pair.
She cannot go without gloves.
The Moffats are society.
You're absolutely correct.
Tell Meg she may borrow mine.
Meg, you can take Marmee's!
Oh, dear!
Ohh!
- More tea?
- No, thank you.
Sally Moffat, you won't be able to draw your laces.
At my coming out party, I didn't eat for weeks beforehand.
Oh, Meg, I do like that color on you.
It's just like forget-me-nots.
The nicest I've seen that kind of fabric since the war broke out.
But you had it made up so plain.
Well, I-- I do my own sewing, and--
Mrs. Finster's on Charles Street carries silk pieces ready-made.
- Tomorrow I'll take you there.
- Marches haven't bought silk in years.
They have views on slavery.
Meg, isn't it true your father's school had to close... when he admitted a little dark girl?
The silk of Mrs. Finster's isn't milled in the South.
It's made right here, over in Linfield.
This isn't China silk?
They use little children for labor.
All the silk mills do.
The poor are always with us.
You are so good to remind us.
May I tell you something?
This is an afternoon dress.
I'm going to make you my pet.
Tonight Miss March shall have as many conquests as she likes.
You have no corset.
Come on.
Not for me, thank you.
No, I believe the next dance is the polka... with me.
I would dance with you, Mr. Parker... but I fear for my new slippers.
My credo is, " Don't tread on me."
Miss March.
I thought your family were temperance people.
Laurie.
Oh, don't cover up.
There may be one or two gentlemen here... who haven't seen all of your charms.
I did promise Jo I would show you off.
The girls dressed me up, and I rather like it.
Yes, it reveals a whole new Meg.
What do you call this?
Meg!
I'm sorry.
Please don't tell Jo how I've behaved.
Of course not.
If you won't tell anyone how I've behaved.
I was only playing a part... to see how it felt to be Belle Gardiner... with four proposals and 20 pairs of gloves.
You're worth ten of those other girls.
Did you see the way this March girl has gone after the Laurence heir?
Best thing that could happen to the Marches.
Oh!
This ridiculous dress!
I've been tripping over it all night.
Tie something around your neck where it can do you some good.
I don't like people speculating about Laurie and our Meg... as if they were characters in some play.
Nothing provokes speculation more... than the sight of a woman enjoying herself.
Why is it Laurie may do as he likes, flirt and tipple champagne--
And no one thinks the less of him?
Well, I suppose for one practical reason:
Laurie is a man, and as such... he may vote, hold property and pursue any profession he pleases.
And so he is not so easily demeaned.
Why should anyone care what they think?
I do.
It's nice to be praised and admired.
I couldn't help but like it.
Of course not!
I only care what you think of yourself.
If you feel your value lies in being merely decorative...
I fear that someday you might find yourself... believing that's all that you really are.
Time erodes all such beauty, but what it cannot diminish... is the wonderful workings of your mind.
Your humor, your kindness... and your moral courage.
These are the things I cherish so in you.
I so wish I could give my girls a more just world.
I know you'll make it a better place.
Hmm?
"...resounded, resounded with song of the nightingale."
No.
No, I don't want them now.
And keep the music.
I won't be going near a piano for ages.
You need your books in college.
Here's your Dombey and Sons.
I could've sworn there was another volume.
Honestly, Jo...
I won't be taking all of Dickens to Harvard with me.
Oh, no.
You'll have much more important things to read.
Nothing's going to change, Jo.
I wish I could go.
I wish you could too.
You'll come back knowing all sorts of things I don't know... and then I'll hate you.
Oh.
Well, as it happens...
I already know something you don't know.
About Meg and a certain former tutor of mine... soon to be employed at the firm of Laurence and Laurence.
Liar.
Has Meg mislaid a certain personal article... such as a glove?
Meg, John Brooke stole your glove!
What glove?
N-Not my white one?
Brooke's had it forever.
Laurie says he keeps it in his pocket.
You must tell him to return it.
Hannah, don't you think he oughta give it back?
'Tisn't what I think that matters.
Jo?
Meg?
It's, uh, a telegram... from Washington Hospital.
Your father's been wounded.
- Come on, Amy.
That's it.
- There are six.
The household account is in this ledger.
It should see you through the month.
- Of course.
Don't worry about us.
- Oh, Beth?
Look in on the Hummels for me, will you?
I will, Marmee.
Where's Jo?
It's almost 6:00.
Doing battle with Aunt March for Marmee's railway ticket.
Carry a letter to Mrs. Juba at the Hope House.
John!
Mr. Brooke.
I've come to offer myself as an escort to your mother.
Cook packed this up... and Grandfather sends a bottle of spirits for Mr. March.
- That's lovely.
Thank you.
- Marmee?
- Mr. Brooke is here.
- Mrs. March.
Mr. Brooke.
As young Laurence no longer requires a tutor...
Mr. Laurence has commissions for me in Washington.
I should like to be of service to you there.
- We couldn't let you travel alone.
- Mr. Brooke, how kind of you.
- May I?
- Thank you.
Are we to go on the 6:00 train?
Yes, I sent Jo off, but she hasn't--
- I'm here!
- Jo.
Finally.
Twenty-five.
Can Aunt March spare this?
I couldn't bear to ask her.
- I sold my hair.
- Jo, how could you?
Your one beauty.
It isn't going to affect the state of the Union.
- It'll grow back.
- It suits you.
Tell Father that we love him.
- Tell him we pray for him.
- Bring him home.
- I'll never forget his kindness.
- Hannah, thank you.
Oh, I shall miss my little women.
Are you thinking about Father?
No.
My hair.
- A little harder.
- Yeah, I hit him on the noggin.
Wait for me!
Blast!
Oh, dear.
- This stove!
- We'll eat them anyway.
There's no more cornmeal nor coffee.
The grocer won't let us have more on account.
- What can I bring the Hummels?
- Oh, fry the Hummels!
- You spent hours there last week.
- The boys are sick.
I mustn't write of this to Marmee.
- She has enough burdens now.
- I hate money!
Your potatoes!
Come on!
Here!
Air the beds.
And be careful cleaning.
- And don't forget your studies, Amy.
- I won't.
I will.
Go!
- Beth!
- Christine.
I don't understand.
I brought you a potato.
- Laurie's home for the weekend!
- In need of funds, no doubt.
We'd have a week's groceries with what he spends on billiards.
Oh, Jehoshaphat!
Meg!
Meg, you won't believe it!
I've sold the Lost Duke of Gloucester!
Five whole dollars!
I'm an author!
- Beth?
- The Hummel baby is sick.
I feel so strange.
She's burning up, but she says that she's freezing.
She has a terrible thirst, but she won't drink.
Sounds like arsenicum, but she looks more like belladonna.
I saw the Hummels.
Two children taken up to Jesus.
Scarlet fever.
You and Miss Jo won't be harmed.
You had it when you were babies.
But, Miss Amy, we have to send you away.
She won't die.
Will she, Laurie?
God wouldn't let her die.
I don't wanna go away.
I'll come and see you every day.
I swear it.
You won't be alone.
I'm afraid of Aunt March.
If she's unkind to you...
I'll come and take you away.
Where will we go?
Paris?
If I get scarlet fever and die... give Meg my box with the green doves on it.
- And Jo must have my turquoise ring.
- I'll see to that.
I don't wanna die.
I've never even been kissed.
I've waited my whole life to be kissed.
And what if I miss it?
I tell you what.
I promise to kiss you before you die.
Whoa!
I don't know.
I don't think Marmee should leave Father.
Beth needs Marmee.
She depends on her.
But what if we send for her and Father gets worse?
How in the name of all that's holy would we pay for the train?
"That he profane not my 'sancteraries'--"
- Sanctuary.
- "Sanctuaries.
For I, the Lord, do sanctify them.
And Moses told it unto Aaron and to his sons... and unto all the children of Israel."
Go on.
"And the Lord spake unto Moses saying--"
Jo, Mr. Laurence is here.
If we may, I wish my personal physician, Dr. Bangs... to examine the little girl.
There's nothing to be done.
If I bleed her, it would finish her.
- Best to send for the mother.
- Forgive me.
I've already done so.
Mrs. March arrives on the train this night.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women and--
Cricket, Marmee's here.
Icy cold.
Jo.
Jo, fetch a basin with vinegar water and rags.
Meg, my kit.
Must draw the fever down from her head.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right now.
That's my love.
Beth!
And so our dear Beth came back to us... although the fever had weakened her heart forever.
We did not know then that a shadow had fallen.
We prepared for another Christmas without Father.
Try each corner.
Thank you.
No, no!
One bow is enough!
Mr. Laurence.
Thank you.
- Oh.
I'm so sorry.
- It happens all the time.
Here she comes!
- Come on!
Come on!
- What should I do with these bows?
Now, don't scare her to death.
She's been sick, you know.
Hide the chairs.
Hide them, Amy!
Quick.
The house is beautiful.
They're friends of mine from college.
Freddy Vaughan and Averill Watson.
They won't bite.
No, don't sit there!
Sit--
Here.
Sit here child.
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Beth!
- Merry Christmas, Beth!
I should have given it to you long ago.
It belonged to my little girl... who had to leave us when she was very young.
But now, it will make music again.
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.
Play something, Beth.
Shall I?
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la La la la la
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la La la la la
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa la la la la la La la la
Troll the ancient yuletide carol
Fa la la la la La la la la
See the blazing yule before us
Fa la la la la La la la la
Strike the harp and join the chorus
Fa la la la la La la la la
Follow me in merry measure
Fa la la la la la La la la
While I tell of yuletide treasure
Fa la la la la La la la la
That was good.
I fear you would have a long engagement.
Three or four years.
John must secure a house before you can marry... and he must do a service to the Union.
John?
Marry?
You mean that pokey old Mr. Brooke?
How did he weasel his way into this family?
John has been very kind to go visit father in the hospital every day.
He's dull as powder.
Meg, can't you at least marry someone amusing?
I'm fond of Mr. Brooke.
He's a good man.
He's kind and serious... and I'm not afraid of being poor.
Marmee, you can't just let her go and marry him.
I'd hardly just go and marry anyone.
I would rather Meg marry for love and be a poor man's wife... than marry for riches and lose her self-respect.
So you don't mind that John is poor?
No, but I would rather he have a house.
Why must we marry at all?
Why can't things just stay as they are?
It is only a proposal.
Nothing need be decided.
Now, girls... let's not spoil the day.
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn king
Glory to the newborn king
Peace on earth
- Father?
- And mercy mild
- Father!
- Merry Christmas, everyone.
What a wonderful Christmas present!
Oh, Father, you're home!
Oh, you're more handsome than ever!
Beth, my little cookie.
Thank God you're well.
Give the man room to breathe.
Jo!
Oh, my wild girl!
Well, this could become the fashion.
- Watch his arm.
Be careful.
- I'm not used to this.
Be very careful now.
Don't coddle this soldier too much.
Oh, Father!
Hannah, God bless you.
It's good to see you.
It's good to have you home, Mr. March.
Now, let me look at my girls.
Take them and give them--
The cholera took more men than the rebs, as I understand it, sir.
Agriculture isn't taught, and it should be.
It should be required.
Perhaps the freedmen should be given land in the West.
- What happened between you and John?
- Never you mind.
Isn't it wonderful, Jo?
Yes, it's wonderful.
Welcome home, soldier.
Would you like some water, sir?
From our birth
Over and around us lies
Lord of all to Thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise
Change will come as surely as the seasons and twice as quick.
We make our peace with it as best we can... or as Amy once said when she was still a little girl:
"We'll all grow up someday.
We might as well know what we want. "
Sun and moon and stars of light
Lord of all to Thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise
Lord of all to Thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise
So you feel our Amy has talent?
Oh, Miss March excels at drawing... but, you know, her landscapes lack emotion.
I definitely feel Amy would benefit from further study... but she won't get it around here.
Where do you suggest?
Cape Cod has a fine artist colony... but Europe is the best place.
Your houseman said you wouldn't be home till night.
- I couldn't wait so long.
- Hail the conquering graduate!
Is Grandfather exceedingly proud?
Yes, and exceedingly bent on locking me up in one of his offices.
Why is it Amy may paint china and you can scribble away... while I must manfully set my music aside?
Why must you?
If I don't...
I'd have to defy Grandfather.
Yes, and not the whole of society.
I can't go against the old man.
When I imagine myself in that life...
I can think of only one thing... that would make me happy.
Oh, no, Teddy.
Teddy, don't.
No, wait, Teddy.
We have to talk about this reasonably.
I have loved you... since the moment I clamped eyes on you.
Would could be more reasonable than to marry you?
- We'd kill each other.
- Nonsense.
- Neither of us can keep our temper.
- I can... unless provoked.
We're both stupidly stubborn, especially you.
- We'd only quarrel.
- I wouldn't!
You can't even propose without quarreling.
Dear Jo, I swear I'll be a saint.
I'll let you win every argument.
I'll take care of you and your family.
I'll give you every luxury you've ever been denied.
You won't have to write unless you want to.
Grandfather... wants me to learn the business in England.
Can't you see us bashing around London?
London.
Oh, Teddy, I'm not fashionable enough for London.
You need someone who's elegant and refined.
I want you.
Teddy, please, don't ask me.
- Teddy, I'm desperately sorry.
- No.
- I do care for you...
- No.
with all of my heart.
You're my dearest friend.
I just can't go be a wife.
You say you won't, but... you will.
I won't.
One day... you'll meet some man.
A good man.
And you will love him tremendously.
And you will live and die for him.
- Teddy, please.
- You will.
I know you.
And I'll be hanged... if I stand by and watch.
Jo, are you ill?
She has refused Laurie.
Well, I'm sure she can take it back.
It's just a misunderstanding.
Listen to him.
I must get away.
Of course.
Aunt March is going to France.
France!
That's ideal!
I'll put up with anything to go!
Aunt March has asked me to go.
To Europe?
My Europe?
When?
It was decided just today.
Well, I am her companion now.
She wishes me to study painting abroad... in hopes I might make a good match there.
But perhaps she wouldn't mind if you stayed at Plumfield... while we are gone.
Of course Aunt March prefers Amy over me.
Why shouldn't she?
I'm ugly and awkward, and I always say the wrong things.
I fly around throwing away perfectly good marriage proposals.
I love our home, but I'm just so fitful that I can't stand being here!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Marmee.
There's just something really wrong with me.
I want to change, but I can't... and I just know I'll never fit in anywhere.
Jo, you have so many extraordinary gifts.
How can you expect to lead an ordinary life?
You're ready to go out and find a good use for your talent.
Although I don't know what I shall do without my Jo.
Go... and embrace your liberty... and see what wonderful things come of it.
Laurie sought his refuge in London and abroad.
Marmee helped me find a place in the great city of New York... and so I stepped over the divide between childhood and all that lay beyond.
Mrs. Kirk?
Josephine!
- Yes.
How do you do?
- Kitty, Minnie.
This is Miss March.
Her father was Colonel March.
He knew your papa.
- It was cold.
- Watch your feet, Mr. Costigan.
- Do come in, my dear.
- You're making that up.
Dear Beth:
Marmee's friend, Mrs. Kirk, has made me feel quite at home.
My little students, Kitty and Minnie, are dear girls.
How curious to grow up in a busy boarding house... with no father and your own mother the innkeeper.
I felt bold on leaving Concord... but I confess I find New York rough and strange... and myself strange in it.
Please pass these down the table.
Thank you kindly, Professor.
Mrs. Kirk believes that I am here... for a brief interlude of sensational experience... before succumbing to a matrimonial fate.
Excuse me, miss.
And while there is surely no lack of sensational experience... of every kind available in such a city...
- Come in!
- I hope, though I've had no luck yet... that any experience I gain here will be strictly literary... and that all events of a romantic or sensational nature... will be entirely confined to the page.
Our subscribers are not interested in sentiment and fairy stories, miss.
They're not fairy stories.
Try one of the ladies' magazines.
- Come on, Will!
Hurry up!
- I'm coming!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so clumsy.
You know that when first I saw you, I thought...
"Ah!
She is a writer."
What made you think so?
Yes, I know many writers.
In Berlin I was professor at the university.
Here I am just a humble tutor, I'm afraid.
Please, sit down.
Thank you.
You are far from home, Miss March?
- Do you miss your family?
- Oh, very much.
My sisters especially.
And Laurie.
She is your sister?
No, he's a friend.
You like your coffee?
Oh, it's... just very strong.
I like it.
You have quite a library.
Did you bring all these books from Germany?
A few of them.
- May I?
- Of course.
Most of these I could not bear to leave behind.
I sold everything that I own to get my passage to come here... but my books... never.
Shakespeare.
Some books are so familiar.
Reading them is like being home again.
Will you be returning to Berlin, Professor Bhaer?
Friedrich.
Call me Friedrich.
Friedrich.
No.
Sadly, the fatherland of Goethe and Schiller... is no more.
I adore Goethe.
My father used to read me all the German poets when I was a child.
Really?
That is most surprising.
My mother and father were part of... a rather unusual circle in Concord.
Do you know the word "transcendentalist"?
But this is German romantic philosophy.
We throw off all our constraints and we come to know ourselves... through insight and experience.
It got out of fashion now.
Not in the March family, I'm afraid.
It's just that with all of this transcendence... comes much emphasis on perfecting oneself.
This gives you a problem?
I'm hopelessly flawed.
If only we could... transcend ourselves without perfection.
Like your poet, Walt Whitman... who rides up and down the streets of Broadway all day... shouting poetry against the roar of the carts.
" Keep your silent woods, O Nature...
- "And your quiet places by the river--
- And your quiet places by the woods... by the woods.
Give me the streets of Manhattan."
I think we are all hopelessly flawed.
He is as poor as one might imagine an itinerant philosopher to be.
Yet, as the weeks go by, I see that he is unfailingly generous... to all of us who live in the house.
I am grateful to have a friend.
It is the system our nation was founded on.
Come now.
It was nothing short of a betrayal of our country's ideals.
Our country's ideals?
A constitution... that denies the basic rights of citizenship to women and black people?
They just passed the 15th Amendment, Jacob.
- They can vote.
- Black men can vote, Charles.
A lady has no need of suffrage if she has a husband.
- You don't take wine?
- Only medicinally.
Pretend that you've got a cold.
I agree, but if women are a moral force... shouldn't they have the right to govern and preach and testify in court?
What is it, Miss March?
I find it poor logic to say that because women are good... women should vote.
Men do not vote because they are good.
They vote because they are male.
And women should vote not because they are angels and men are animals... but because we are human beings and citizens of this country.
You should have been a lawyer, Miss March.
I should have been a great many things, Mr. Mayer.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, please.
Please, come in.
I have some good news.
A newspaper has published two of my stories, and they wish to see more.
This is wonderful.
Right there.
- The Daily Volcano?
- Yes.
"The Sinner's Corpse"... by Joseph March.
Lunatics.
Vampires.
This interests you?
People like thrilling stories, Friedrich.
This is what the newspapers want.
Yes.
Yes, I suppose.
I suppose that is true.
It will buy a new coat for Beth, and I'm sure she'll be grateful to have it.
I do not want to be your teacher.
No, understand me.
I am saying only that you should please yourself.
My opinion is of no importance.
Do you forgive me?
- Of course.
- Then I make a gift.
An experience.
Do you like the opera?
Oh, I do.
I mean, I think I do.
We don't seem to get a lot of opera in Concord.
I don't have an opera dress.
You will be perfect.
Where we are sitting, we shall not be so... formal.
Leila is a goddess.
She has made a promise never to love.
If she breaks her vow, all will be lost.
Oh, look.
Trouble is coming.
- What's going to happen?
- The inevitable.
Leila's soul is opening.
She's drawn to an idea.
He says, " Love has a fatal power."
Your heart... understood mine.
In the depth of the fragrant night...
I listened with ravished soul... to your beloved voice.
Your heart understood mine.
Oh, Laurie!
You wicked!
We heard you were in Greece or somewhere.
Laurie!
Come!
Come!
You've been much occupied with business, I am sure.
I'm not pursuing business just now.
Grandfather agreed I should concentrate... on my music for a while.
You know Fred Vaughan?
- Freddy.
- Good day, Laurence.
Yes.
I see you've taken up a passion for art, Freddy.
Aunt March, you look splendid.
I cannot say the same for you, my boy.
Amy dear.
- Will you be long?
I must retire.
- Yes, Aunt March.
Do come see us.
- Are they engaged?
- Not yet.
Hop, hop.
One, two, three, four.
Hop, hop, hop, turn.
Friedrich, how long would it take strychnine to dissolve in brandy?
Oh.
About eight minutes?
And is a dagger worn at the waist, or is that a saber?
I think that in these novels... the dagger is usually concealed in the boot... by a man with a dark moustache.
Go this way.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Oh, Laurie, how lovely.
It isn't what it should be, but you have improved it.
Please don't.
I liked you much better when you were blunt and natural.
It did not serve me well.
I find you changed.
In fact, I despise you.
You laze about spending your family's money and courting women.
You aren't serious about music.
My compositions are like your paintings:
mediocre copies of another man's genius.
Then why don't you go to Grandfather in London and make yourself useful?
I should.
Why don't you reform me?
I've someone more practical in mind.
You do not love Fred Vaughan.
Fred Vaughan is stable and well-mannered--
And has 40,000 a year.
I've always known I would not marry a pauper.
I expect a proposal any day.
You'll regret it.
I'll regret it.
I'm reminded of a promise.
Didn't I say I would kiss you before you die?
Do you hear from Jo?
She has befriended a German professor.
Yes.
No doubt he's showing her... the ways of the world.
I do not wish to be courted by someone who is still in love with my sister!
I'm not in love with Jo.
Then how do you explain your jealousy?
I envy her happiness.
I envy his happiness.
I envy John Brooke for marrying Meg.
I hate Fred Vaughan.
If Beth had a lover, I would despise him too.
Just as you have always known you would never marry a pauper...
I have always known...
I should be part of the March family.
I do not wish to be loved for my family.
Any more than Fred Vaughan wishes to be loved for his 40,000 a year.
My darling Amy.
It is you I want and not your family.
I've gone to London to make myself worthy of you.
Please, do not do anything we shall regret.
Monsieur Vaughan, mademoiselle.
May I show him in?
- Friedrich, did you read it?
- Yes.
It's well written, Jo.
And the first novel.
What a great accomplishment.
I'm going to be showing it to your publisher friend, Mr. Fields, today.
He liked "The Sinner's Corpse."
What is it?
Mr. Fields is a good man.
He will give you an honest opinion.
Oh, I see.
What is your honest opinion?
- I'm a professor of philosophy.
- No, I'd like to know what you think.
You should be writing from life... from the depths of your soul.
There is nothing in here of the woman that I am privileged to know.
Friedrich, this is what I write.
My apologies if it fails to live up to your high standards.
Jo, there is more to you than this... if you have the courage to write it.
Why didn't you tell me?
One hardly speaks of such things.
Oh, how wonderful.
How is Beth?
You will find her much altered.
Marmee.
She wouldn't let us send for you sooner.
The doctor has been here a number of times... but it's beyond all of us, and I think--
I think she's been waiting for you... before--
You're going to drink up all of this good broth.
I'm glad you're home.
So am I.
" Mr. Pickwick changed color.
'Ah,' said Mr. Wartle.
'Well, that's important.
There's nothing suspicious then, I suppose."'
I feel stronger with you close by.
I'm going to get you better yet.
If God wants me with Him, there is none who will stop Him.
I don't mind.
I was never like the rest of you... making plans about the great things I'd do.
I never saw myself as anything much.
Not a great writer like you.
Beth, I'm not a great writer.
But you will be.
Oh, Jo, I've missed you so.
Why does everyone want to go away?
I love being home.
But I don't like being left behind.
Now I am the one going ahead.
I am not afraid.
I can be brave like you.
But I know I shall be homesick for you... even in heaven.
I won't let you go.
Oh, my Jo.
Aunt March is bedridden and would not survive a sea voyage.
Amy must bide her time and return later.
It's just as well.
Will we never all be together again?
Lovely morning.
Thank you, sir.
Dearest Laurie:
You may not have heard our sad news of Beth's--
" Meg has entered her confinement... and poor Amy must stay in Vevey with Aunt March."
This is far too great a sorrow to bear alone.
Please come home to us, Teddy dear.
Your faithful, Jo.
I knew you would come.
The real charm of it lay in Beth's happy face... as she leaned over the new piano and lovingly touched... the beautiful black and white keys.
During the next few minutes, the rumor circulated... that Amy March had got 24 delicious limes.
I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you... that they powdered and squeezed and made me look a fashion plate.
As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet.
A general outcry arose, for all her abundant hair was cut short.
Jo, how could you?
Your one beauty.
Nothing's going to change, Jo.
For the beauty of the earth
For the glory of the skies
For the love which from our birth
Over and around us lies
Lord of all to Thee we raise
This our hymn of grateful praise
Surprise!
John, you have a daughter.
And a son.
Oh, Marmee, I can't believe you did this four times.
Yes, but never two at once, my darling.
Oh, Daisy.
Oh, Meg, she's so beautiful.
And him.
He is handsome.
He's going to look just like his papa when he grows up.
Yes, he does look like John.
Have you heard from the professor?
We did not part well.
John and I don't always agree, but then we mend it.
Who could that be?
Oh, this is magic!
You are absolutely--
Covered in flour!
Oh, dear!
- Come in.
- No, Jo, not yet.
May I tell you something without the others?
You're my dear friend.
I'm glad that you shall be the first to know.
- What?
- May I present... my wife.
Oh, my!
- Here, flowers.
- Thank you.
Come in!
Brussels lace!
Oh!
I went to Europe to paint the great cathedrals... but I couldn't get our home out of my mind.
Oh, look how Amy has captured Orchard House.
- Lovely.
- Oh, it's beautiful.
Not as beautiful as I wanted, but I am still learning.
Dear little angel.
Jo, you must tell me the truth, as a sister... which is a relation stronger than marriage.
Do you mind at all?
Oh, no.
I was surprised.
Mind you, I had it on good authority that our Teddy... would never love another.
And now he's gone and gotten married.
It's good to hear you call me Teddy again.
At last, we're all family, as we always should have been.
You must promise me that you will always live close by.
I couldn't bear losing another sister.
Jo, it's so gloomy and chilly.
One would require an income just for the coal to heat this place.
What could the dear old girl have been thinking?
Most likely she felt sorry for me.
Decrepit homeless spinster!
Oh, poor Aunt.
Living here all those years alone in this useless old house.
Yes, her blessings became a burden because she couldn't share them.
Wouldn't this have made a wonderful school?
A school.
What a challenge that would be.
Hello, Tuppy.
Hello.
Good boy.
My book!
Someone's publishing my book.
- Someone's publishing my book!
- Heaven help us!
It came with no letter.
How did it arrive?
Foreign gentleman brung it.
Strange kind of name.
Can't think of it.
Oh, Fox, or Bear or such.
Bhaer!
Did you ask him to wait?
I thought he was one of Miss Amy's European friends... coming with a wedding gift.
I said, " Miss March and Mr. Laurie are living next door."
- Hannah, you didn't!
- Then he said he had a train to catch.
Friedrich!
Oh, Friedrich, thank you for my book.
When I didn't hear from you...
I thought you hated it.
Oh, no.
Reading your book was like opening a window... into your heart.
James Fields took it out of my hands, and he would not give it back to me.
I said, "Such news I have to give to her myself."
Well, it was a silly impulse.
No, not silly at all.
It's so good to see you.
- Come and meet my family.
- No, I--
Thank you, but...
I have to catch a train.
I am going to the West.
My ship leaves from Boston tomorrow morning.
Yes, the schools in the West are young.
They need professors and... they are not so concerned about the accent.
I don't mind it either.
See, my aunt left me Plumfield.
It isn't a field.
It's a house, actually.
A rather large house.
And it isn't really good for anything except a school... and I want a good school... one that would be open to anyone who wanted to learn, and, well...
I'll be needing someone who knows how to teach.
Is there nothing I might say to keep you here?
I confess that I was hoping that I might have a reason... to stay, but... congratulations on the celebration of your marriage.
Oh, no!
No, that's Amy.
That's my sister.
Amy and Laurie, actually.
No, I'm not married.
Please don't go so far away.
Jo.
Such a little name for-- for such a person.
Will you have me?
With all of my heart!
But I have nothing to give you.
My hands are empty.
Not empty now.
A temporary poverty had hit our family some years before.
The war made fuel and lamp oil scarce.
The war made fuel and lamp oil scarce.
But necessity is the mother of invention.
Somehow in that dark time, the March family created its own light.
Marmee's home!
We've expectorated you for hours!
- "Expected", featherhead !
- Marmee, you're frozen.
- So many people at Hope House!
- You finished the bundles?
So many this year!
We handed out ...
How's your cold?
We gave them out as fast as we made them.
Now, Miss Amy, what's in my pocket?
Father!
"Dearest family.
I am well and safe."
"Our battalion is encamped on the Potomac."
"December is cold for us, so far from home."
"I think of my girls day and night.
It comforts me."
"I pray your own hardships may not be too great.
Give them my love."
"tell them I think of them by day, pray for them by night."
I'm a selfish girl.
It's Christmas Eve.
Father wouldn't want us to be sad.
To bed, Miss Amy.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- I Iove you.
- My Jo ...
MerryChristmas.
- Merry Christmas, Marmee.
- Don't sit up too late.
- I won't.
At night, my mind came alive with voices and friends as dear to me as my real ones.
I gave myself up to it, longing for transformation.
What miraculous food !
Isn't this just like the old days, Hannah?
- We should just look at it!
- Jo, come down.
I'm awake!
horrible piano ...
- Hannah's made a Christmas miracle.
- Is that sausage?
Wait!
Butter!
Isn't butter divinity?
God, thank you for this breakfast.
Fetch Marmee.
She went out at dawn to see some Germans.
"hummel," the boy said.
No english.
His dad's gone.
Six children, and another coming.
May as well take them firewood, they haven't any.
Or breakfast.
We could send the HummeIs our bread.
And the butter, too.
It's not much use without bread.
- wonderful snow!
- WouIdn't you Iike to roll in it?
Once one of our finest families.
- lovely weather for a picnic.
- Come on, Theodore.
We'II be late.
Jo, Iet them speak first.
What will they think of us?
Don't look back!
"Knights and ladies, monks and flowergirls, all mingled in the dance."
"PauIine cried out as the groom's mask fell."
"It was not her lover Ferdinand, but his sworn enemy Count Antonio."
"Revenge is mine," quoth he.
- "Continued in the next edition."
- excellent, Mr. Snodgrass!
- I Iove forbidden marriages!
- You ought to publish it, Jo.
What's wrong with our newspaper, Mr. Tupman?
"One periwink ...
Advertisement."
"One periwinkIe sash has been abscondated from the wash line."
"A gentleman desires any reports leading to its recovery."
gentlemen of the press:
Hear, hear!
"I call your attention to Mr. Tupman's History of the Squash."
- This is a recipe, Beth !
- I never know what to write.
The first rule of writing is, never write what you know.
What do you think of the boy?
Is he a captive like Smee in "NichoIas nickleby"?
He looks lonely.
Maybe he has a secret.
A tragic, European secret.
He was reared in italy among artists and vagrants.
He has a noble brow.
If I was a boy, I'd Iike to look like that.
Imagine giving up italy to come and live with that awful old man.
I'd be terrified to live with him.
I'd Iike to live in such a fine house with nice things.
It doesn't seem like Christmas without presents.
I'm desperate for drawing pencils.
I wish I didn't have to work for Great-Aunt March.
What's your Christmas wish, Beth?
I'd Iike the war to end, so Father can come home.
- Sweet Beth !
We all want that.
- They have a beautiful piano.
When I'm a writer, I'II buy you the best piano ever.
Or else you can play on mine.
When I marry, I'II be disgustingly rich.
What if the man you love is poor but good, Iike Father?
It's not Iike being stuck with a dreadful nose.
One can choose.
I wouldn't marry for money.
What if his business goes bust?
The eagle pays five dollars a story.
I have ten in my head right now.
gentlemen !
I dislike all this money talk.
If lack of attention to finance is refinement, then the Marches are the most elegant family in Concord.
We'II all grow up one day, Meg.
We might as well know what we want.
That'II do.
- Put the carriage away.
quickly!
- Merry Christmas.
I have a wonderful feeling.
tell me all about belle Gardiner.
About her nose and her ring.
Annie says it's an emerald.
Everyone's lucky but me!
I'm glad I don't have to go and be with all those frightening people.
Jo, don't eat much at supper, and don't shake hands ...
Yourdress!
You stand too close to the fire.
Just keep your back to the wall.
- What cunning little heels!
- They're rather small.
It's only one night.
will anyone notice they're from the rag bag?
You have to have heels.
What's that strange smell?
Like burnt feathers ...
- Heavens above!
- You've ruined me!
You shouldn't have had me do it.
I spoil everything.
- I can't go out like this.
- Good.
I'm not going either.
We'II place my bow in front.
Yes, that covers it.
I'II never have suitors.
I'II be an old spinster.
You don't need scores of suitors, only one.
The right one.
- Listen to the child !
- Meg won't be married right away.
With Jo's help, I never will.
- You must be so happy!
- It's enchanting.
I'd best go help Mama.
Excuse me.
- Jehosephat!
I'm sorry.
- Stay!
It's a good hiding place.
I feel awkward just standing and staring at people.
should I put on my jacket?
I don't know the rules.
I'm Laurie.
Theodore Laurence ... calledLaurie.
Jo March.
So, who were you staring at?
- At you.
What game was that?
- I don't know, but I think I won.
Who else?
I was quite taken with ... thatone.
That's Meg.
That's my sister.
She's completely bald in front.
Is it true you lived in italy among artists and vagrants?
My mother was italian.
A pianist.
- Grandfather disapproved of her.
- I saw a play like that.
Do you Iike the theatre?
Were you born there?
- Where . .?
In italy.
- Do you speak French or italian?
english at home.
Francais a l'école.
Music Conservatory, but Grandfather got me a tutor.
He insists I go to college.
I'd commit murder to go to college!
actually, I'm going to Europe.
At least, I hope I am.
My great-aunt says she'II go soon.
I work as her companion.
I have to read to her for hours.
But I do all the voices.
Were I not going to be a writer, I'd go to New York and pursue the stage.
- Are you shocked?
- Very!
Sorry!
Meg makes me take the gentleman's part.
A shame you don't know the lady's part!
Are you looking at the back of my dress?
You promised you wouldn't look!
- I've sprained my ankle.
- It's the shoes.
Does it hurt?
- No!
I'm quite well.
- This is our neighbour Laurie.
- I'II get Mrs. Gardiner.
- No, she'II think it's the punch.
- A perfectly good party ruined.
- Let me take you home.
Thank you !
Here, Iean on me.
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.
- Bye, Laurie!
- Wherever did you get this shoe?
Did you ride in his carriage?
You're so lucky.
Is he very romantic?
- Not in the slightest.
- He's a dreadful boy.
He was wise to use snow.
He put snow on her ankle?
With his own hands?
- Stop being so swoony.
- You mustn't be silly about boys.
- Does this hurt?
- Everything lovely happens to Meg.
Don't be soppy about Laurie.
I hope we'II be good friends.
- With a boy?
- He isn't a boy.
He's Laurie.
Faster!
Faster!
The young ladies are unusually active, if I may say so.
girls need exertion just like boys.
Feminine weakness is the result of keeping them at home, bent over needlework, in restrictive corsets.
Marmee!
Your young student is an athlete.
He is, thank you.
A good one.
But he's an unruly scholar.
I regret that his grandfather is away much.
One hopes that your girls will be a gentIing influence.
Must you speak to everyone about corsets?
Do I?
blast these wretched skirts!
- Don't say "blast".
- Amy, don't be such a ninny-pinny.
I wish I was Beth, so I couId stay home.
If you Iike laundry and housework!
- blast!
- Amy, hurry.
I'II be late for work.
There's Mrs. King.
I'm tardy again.
- lovely children !
- Meg, must I go to school?
I'm so degradetated.
I owe at Ieast a dozen Iimes.
- Are Iimes the fashion?
- It's nothing but Iimes now.
Everyone keeps them in their desks and trades them for beads.
If you don't bring Iimes, you're nothing.
I can't pay anyone back.
No wonder you don't learn anything.
I know how it feels to do without luxuries.
We're not destitute yet.
Here's a quarter.
Marmee gave me the rag money this month.
"secondly, the immortality of the soul is asserted to be in consequence of its immateriality, as in all Ieipothymic cases consistent with the idea of immortality."
"And immorality and physicality ... "
... andIthink you finally dozed off.
Josephine!
There's a draught!
Is it Father?
Teacher struck me.
He put the limes out into the snow.
May Chester said my Iimes were for the homeless.
So I said she wouldn't get any from me.
So she told Mr. Davis they were in my desk, and he struck me.
- I'II beat the tar out of him !
- Jo, we must not embrace violence.
- I will write him a letter.
- That'II show him.
You didn't say they were forbidden.
A month's rag money!
- I shouldn't have given it to you.
- I'm sorry.
AII those lovely Iimes.
- I'm perfectly desoIated.
- It's a frivolous concern.
You're more concerned with your nose than your character.
It's an appalling school.
Your spelling's atrocious.
Mr. Davis said it was as useful to educate a woman as a cat.
I'II strangle Mr. Davis!
"Mr. Davis ...
Whatrighthaveyou to strike a child?"
"In God's eyes we are all children.
If you hit and humiliate a child, the only lesson she will learn is to hit and humiliate."
Can you discipline yourself to Iearn at home, as Beth has done?
- I withdraw Amy from your school.
- Serves him right!
Jo will now supervise your education.
Jo, tell me what happens next.
After the duke renounces his fortune and saves Lady Zara ...
I don't know.
It's all murder.
The damsel's in distress.
I Iove your damseIs in distress.
Beth, truly, I don't know if I couId ever be good like Marmee.
I rather crave violence.
If only I couId be like Father, and go to war and fight injustice.
- So Marmee does, in her own way.
- Yes ...
I want to do something different.
I don't know what, I'm on the watch.
You'II find it, Jo.
Jo!
Come over here!
You too, Meg !
It's dead as tombs around here.
One doesn't shout at ladies like cattle.
My apologies!
What do those girls do all day?
Over the mysteries of female life is drawn a veil best left undisturbed.
"Dear Countess, pray for me, for I have sinned against myself and my brother Roderigo."
You've got to say "sinned" as if you've really sinned.
Roderigo:
You arrive, seeking the Duke of Lancashire.
Hark, ye!
Who goes there?
I forgot the cymbals.
It's Roderigo!
I want to be Lady violet.
I'm exhaustified of being the boy.
"The play's the thing," Amy.
You're too little to be Lady violet.
- Be the Countess de Montanescu.
- You've no lines.
Besides, who'd be Roderigo?
gentlemen ...
I propose a new member for our theatrical society:
Theodore Laurence.
- He'II laugh at us.
- He'II think it's only a game.
- He won't.
I promise.
- We'd have to guard our conduct.
We bare our souls and tell secrets.
- He would find us improper.
- Teddy would certainly not!
please!
Let's try him, shall we?
- Traitor!
- Artists!
May I present myself ...
... asan actor,musician, and a loyal and humble servant of the club.
In token of my gratitude and to promote communication, shouting from the windows being forbidden, I shall provide a post office in our hedge.
To further encourage the baring of our souls and the telling of our secrets.
I do pledge never to reveal what I hear in confidence here.
well then ...
- Do take your place, Roderigo.
- Sir Roderigo.
So Laurie was admitted into our society.
And we enjoyed the daily novelty of having our own real brother.
- l want to go to the theatre!
- No.
Where are the opera glasses?
You're just hogging Laurie.
please, can't I go?
Laurie only reserved four seats.
Do I Iook shabby?
It's not a coronation, just Laurie and that awful Mr. Brooke.
- Ask him for another ticket.
- No.
- You've a cold.
Rest your eyes.
- We'II make ginger tea.
You're weeks behind in algebra.
I won't have an ignorant sister.
Don't suIk, you look like a pigeon.
You'II be sorry, Jo March !
Thank you.
Mrs. neil Watson, wasn't she a wonderful swooner?
- If only I were the swooning type.
- And I the catching type!
Young Laurence says you are an aficionado of the theatre.
I enjoy reading plays.
Yes, I find it most pleasurable myself.
But I am distracted at the theatre, thinking of actors' peculiar lives.
With such immodesties, one wonders what sort of lady wants such a life.
Meg is a sensational actress.
We put on wild theatricaIs.
It's just something that we play at.
well, as a matter of fact, at school ...
What do you think of that?
Let's see what they do!
I had a wonderful time, Mr. Brooke.
It was a most delightful evening.
- Thank you very much.
Goodnight!
- Goodnight!
- That was rude.
- You plastered yourself on him.
- It's proper to take a man's arm.
- How was the theatre?
It was wonderful.
I was absolutely inspired by the love scene.
You look flushed.
Was the theatre overcrowded?
still sulking?
Where did I put my manuscript?
I didn't do it!
I'm going to kill you !
Jehosephat!
How could you do this to me?
Jo, stop it!
You're hurting her.
- Let her go.
What's happened?
- I hate you !
Don't touch it, just let it go.
You're dead !
You're nothing !
I never want to see you again !
It's a great loss.
You have every right to be put out.
But don't let the sun go down on your anger.
Forgive each other.
- Begin again tomorrow.
- I'II never forgive her.
I'm sorry, Jo.
Looks like the Iast ice this year.
- Say "go".
- Wait for me.
Ignore her.
Ready ...
blast!
Amy!
hold on !
hold on, Amy!
Get a rail !
Grab it, Amy!
hold on !
There we go.
That's it, that's it.
Josephine March, you walked from WaIden Pond in just bIoomers?
- As if she noticed !
Dear Amy.
- How could I be so horrible?
- Thank God for Laurie.
- Do you love him more than me?
Don't be a beetle!
I couId never love anyone as I Iove my sisters.
You left out the part where Lady Zara succumbs to the duke's rival.
Right!
Sir Hugo ...
I quite prefer him myself.
In the spring, we prepared for Meg to go to Sally Moffat's coming-out.
Myself, I'd sooner be hung than attend a fancy ball.
Wait until all Boston sees you !
I told Laurie to keep you from being a wallflower upon penalty of death.
Where is that miserable glove?
abigail, I shake my head at how you're managing Margaret.
How is she to be married without a proper début?
Things will not change with your husband's return.
My nephew is as foolish with money as with his new philosophies.
The one hope for your family is for Margaret to marry well.
Though I don't know who marries governesses.
And this one is entirely ruined with books.
Are those for me?
They're for Meg to take with her.
Marmee, she's lost a glove!
She can't go without gloves.
They're society.
You're right.
She may borrow mine.
- Meg !
You can take Marmee's!
- Oh, dear ...
- More tea?
- No thank you !
sally Moffat, you won't be able to draw your laces.
At my coming-out, I didn't eat for weeks.
- I do like that colour on you.
- It's just like forget-me-nots.
I haven't seen such fabric for years.
- But you had it made up so plain.
- well, I do my own sewing, and ...
Mrs. Finster has silk pieces ready-made.
I'II take you there.
The Marches don't buy silk.
They have views on slavery.
Didn't your father's school close when he admitted a dark girl?
Mrs Finster's silk isn't from the South.
It's from LinfieId.
- This isn't China silk?
- The silk mills use child labour.
"The poor are always with us." You're so good to remind us.
May I tell you something?
This is an afternoon dress.
I'II make you my pet.
Hortense, viens ici.
Tonight, Miss March shall have many conquests.
You have no corset!
The next dance is the polka.
With me.
I would dance with you, but I fear for my new slippers.
My credo is:
Don't tread on me!
Miss March ...
I thoughtyourfamily were temperance people?
Don't cover up.
Maybe someone hasn't seen all your charms.
And I promised Jo I'd show you off.
- The girls dressed me.
I Iike it.
- It reveals a whole new Meg.
What do you call this?
Meg ...
I'm sorry.
please don't tell Jo how I've behaved.
If you won't tell about me.
I just wanted to see how it felt to be BeIIe Gardiner.
- AII those proposals and gloves.
- You're worth ten of those girls.
Have you seen the way the March girl went after the Laurence heir?
This ridiculous dress!
I keep tripping over it.
Tie some of it around your neck, where it can do some good.
I don't like people speculating about Laurie and Meg.
Nothing provokes speculation like a woman enjoying herself.
- Why may Laurie flirt and drink?
- And no one thinks less of him?
For one practical reason:
Laurie is a man.
So he may vote, hold property and pursue any profession.
And so he is not so easily demeaned.
- Who cares what people think?
- I do.
It's nice to be praised and admired.
I couldn't help but like it.
I only care what you think of yourself.
If you feel your value lies in being decorative, I fear one day you may think that's all you are.
Time erodes beauty, but not the wonderful workings of your mind.
Your humour, your kindness ...
and your moral courage.
These are the things I cherish in you.
I wish it was a just world.
I know you'II make it a better place.
No, I don't want them.
Keep the music too.
You need your books in college.
Here's Dombey and Son.
honestly, I won't need all of Dickens at Harvard.
No, you'II have more important things to read.
Nothing's going to change, Jo.
- I wish I couId go.
- I wish you could, too.
You'II come back knowing things I don't know, and I'II hate you !
As it happens, I already know something you don't know.
About Meg and a certain former tutor, soon to be employed at Laurence and Laurence.
Has Meg misIaid a certain personal article, such as ...
... a glove?
- John Brooke stole your glove!
- What glove?
The white one?
He's had it forever.
He keeps it in his pocket!
- Don't you think he must return it?
- What I think doesn't matter.
A telegram from Washington hospital.
Your father's been wounded.
- You'II have enough for the month.
- Don't worry.
- Look in on the HummeIs for me.
- I will.
Where's Jo?
battling Aunt March for Marmee's ticket.
- John ...
Mr.Brooke.
- I will escort your mother.
Cook packed supper, and there's a bottle of spirits for Mr. March.
Mr. Brooke is here.
I'm no Ionger a tutor.
Mr. Laurence has work for me in Washington.
- We couldn't let you travel alone.
- How kind of you !
- We'II take the six o'cIock train?
- Yes, I sent Jo ...
finally ... 25!
Can Aunt March spare it?
I couldn't bear to ask her ...
- I sold my hair.
- Jo, your one beauty!
- It'II grow back.
- It suits you.
tell Father that we love him.
tell him we pray for him.
I shall miss my little women !
Are you thinking about Father?
No, my hair ...
Wait for me!
- blast!
This stove ...
- We'II eat them anyway.
There's no corn meal or coffee.
We can't get credit.
- What can I bring the HummeIs?
- Oh, fry the HummeIs!
- The boys are sick.
- I mustn't tell Marmee.
I hate money!
Your potatoes!
I don't understand.
I brought a ...
- Laurie's home!
- He must need funds.
We'd get a week's food from his billiard money.
Meg, I sold "The Lost Duke of gloucester"!
Five whole dollars!
- I'm an author ...
Beth?
- The hummel baby is sick.
I feel so strange.
She's hot, but she feels cold.
She's thirsty, but won't drink.
- Arsenic?
BeIIadonna?
- I saw the HummeIs.
Two children are dead from scarlet fever.
You and Miss Jo have had it.
But, Miss Amy ...
We must send you away.
She won't die, will she, Laurie?
God won't let her die.
I don't want to go away.
I'II come every day, I swear.
You won't be alone.
I'm afraid of Aunt March.
If she's unkind to you, I'II take come and take you away.
- Where will we go?
- Paris?
If I die of scarlet fever, give Meg my box with the green doves on it.
- Jo can have my turquoise ring.
- I'II see to it.
I don't want to die.
I've never even been kissed.
I've waited my whole life to be kissed.
What if I miss it?
I'II tell you what ...
I promise to kiss you before you die.
Marmee mustn't leave Father.
- Beth needs her.
- What if Father gets worse?
And how would we pay for the train?
"That he profane not my sancteraries ... "
- Sanctuaries.
- Sanctuaries.
"For I the Lord do sanctify them."
"And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to all the children of israel."
Go on.
"And the Lord said to Moses ... "
Jo, Mr. Laurence is here.
If we may, my personal physician will examine the little girl.
There's nothing to be done.
If I bleed her, it will finish her.
Best to send for the mother.
I've already done so.
Mrs. March arrives tonight.
Jo!
Cricket, Marmee's here.
Icy cold !
Jo, fetch a basin of vinegar, water, and some rags.
Meg, my kit.
We'II draw the fever down from her head.
Beth ...
And so our Beth came back to us, although fever weakened her heart.
We did not know that a shadow had fallen.
We prepared for another Christmas without Father.
- Try each corner.
- No!
One bow's enough.
- I'm so sorry!
- It happens all the time.
- Here she comes.
- What shall I do with the bows?
The house is beautiful.
Friends of mine from college.
Freddy Vaughan, AveriII Watson.
They won't bite.
- No, don't sit there, sit ...
- Here!
- Sit here, child.
Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
I should have given it to you long ago.
It belonged to my little girl.
She left us when she was very young.
But now it will make music again.
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.
Merry Christmas.
- play something, Beth.
- shall I?
That was good.
I fear you'II have a Iong engagement.
John must get a house first and do his service.
John?
Marry?
That pokey old Mr. Brooke?
How did he sneak into this family?
- He visits Father every day.
- He's dull.
Find someone amusing !
He is good, kind and serious.
I'm not afraid of being poor.
You can't just let her go and marry him.
Better to be a poor man's wife than to lose one's seIf-respect.
- You don't mind that he's poor?
- No.
But I'd rather he had a house.
Why marry?
Why can't things stay as they are?
It's a proposal, nothing need be decided.
Let's not spoil the day.
- Father . .?
Father!
- What a wonderful present!
Beth ...
ThankGodyou 'rewell.
Give him room !
My wild girl !
This could become the fashion.
- Be very careful.
- Don't coddIe me too much.
- Hannah ...
It'sgoodtoseeyou.
- It's good to have you home.
Let me look at my girls.
cholera took more men than the rebs.
agriculture isn't taught, and it should be.
- What happened with you and John?
- Never you mind.
- Isn't it wonderful, Jo?
- Yes, it's wonderful.
Change comes like the seasons, and twice as quick.
We make our peace with it as best we can.
Or, as Amy once said:
"We'll all grow up someday.
We might as well know what we want. "
But her landscapes lack emotion.
I think she'd benefit from study.
But she won't get it around here.
- What do you suggest?
- Cape Cod?
But Europe is best.
Teddy!
You were supposed to come tonight.
hall the conquering graduate!
- Is Grandfather proud?
- Yes.
But he wants me in an office.
Why can Amy paint china, and you can scribble, while I set music aside?
Why must you?
If I don't ...
I'd have to defy Grandfather.
Yes, and not the whole of society.
I can't go against the old man.
When I imagine myself in that life -
- I can think of only one thing that would make me happy.
No.
Teddy ... don't.
We have to talk reasonably.
I have loved you since I first saw you.
What is more reasonable than to marry you?
We'd kill each other.
We can't keep our tempers.
- I can ... unlessprovoked.
- We're stubborn and quarrelsome.
You can't even propose without quarrelling.
Jo ... dearJo .
I swear I'II be a saint.
I'II let you win every argument.
I'II take care of you and your family.
I'II give you every luxury.
You need write only if you want to.
Grandfather wants me to Iearn the business in england.
Can't you see us bashing around London?
I'm not fashionable enough.
You need someone elegant and refined.
I want you.
Teddy, please.
Don't ask me.
I'm desperately sorry.
I do care for you.
You're my dearest friend.
- But I can't go be a wife.
- You say you won't, but ...
- You will !
- I won't, I won't.
One day ...
... you'IImeetsomeman, and you will love him tremendously.
And you will live and die for him.
You will !
I know you.
And I'II be hanged if I stand by and watch.
Are you ill?
She has refused Laurie.
I'm sure she can take it back.
It's just a misunderstanding.
Listen to him ...
- I must get away.
- Of course.
- Aunt March is going to France.
- France!
That's ideal !
- Aunt March asked me to go.
- To Europe?
My Europe.
- When?
- It was decided just today.
I am her companion now.
She wishes me to study painting and make a good match.
But perhaps she wouldn't mind if you stayed at PIumfieId while we're gone.
Of course Aunt March prefers Amy.
I'm ugly and I say the wrong things.
I fly around throwing away good marriage proposals.
I Iove our home, but I'm so fitfuI.
I can't stand being here.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Marmee.
There's something wrong with me.
I want to change, but I can't, and I ...
I just know I'II never fit in anywhere.
Jo, you have so many extraordinary gifts.
How can you expect to lead an ordinary life?
You're ready to go out and find a good use for your talents.
although I don't know what I'II do without my Jo.
Go ... andembraceyourliberty.
And see what wonderful things come of it.
Laurie sought refuge in London and abroad.
Marmee helped me find a place in New York.
So I crossed the line between childhood and what lay beyond.
- Mrs. Kirk?
- Josephine!
- How do you do?
- Kitty, Minnie!
This is Miss March.
Her father, colonel March, knew your papa.
Watch your feet, Mr. Costigan.
Come in, dear.
Dear Beth, Mrs. Kirk has made me feel quite at home.
My little students, Kitty and Minnie, are dear girls.
How curious to grow up in a boarding-house with no father.
I felt bold leaving, but I confess I find New York rough and strange and myself strange in it.
Mrs. Kirk believes I'm here for an exciting interlude before succumbing to matrimony.
But, while there's no lack of sensational experiences here, l hope that any experience I gain may be strictly literary, and that romantic or sensational events are confined to the page.
Our subscribers do not Iike sentiment and fairy stories.
- They're not fairy stories.
- Try one of the ladies' magazines.
You know, when first I saw you, I thought:
- "She is a writer."
- What made you think so?
I know many writers.
In berlin, I was a professor at the university.
Here I'm just a humble tutor, I'm afraid.
No, please, sit down.
You're far from home.
Do you miss your family?
Very much.
My sisters especially.
- And Laurie.
- She's your sister?
No, he's a friend.
- You like your coffee?
- It's very strong ...
I Iikeit .
You have quite a library.
- Did you bring them from Germany?
- A few.
- May I?
- Of course.
Most of these I couId not bear to leave behind.
I sold everything I owned to get my passage.
But my books ...
Never.
Shakespeare ...
Some books are so familiar that it's like being home again.
will you be returning to berlin, Professor Bhaer?
Friedrich.
call me Friedrich.
No.
sadly, the fatherland of Goethe and SchiIIer is no more.
I adore Goethe.
My father used to read me all the German poets.
My mother and father were part of a rather unusual circle in Concord.
- Do you know "transcendentaIism"?
- It's German romantic philosophy.
We throw off constraints and come to know ourselves through insight.
- It's out of fashion now.
- Not in the March family.
But with this transcendence comes much emphasis on perfecting oneself.
- This gives you a problem?
- I'm hopelessly flawed.
If only we could transcend ourselves without perfection.
Like Whitman, who shouts poetry on the street to the roar of the carts.
"Keep your silent woods, oh nature, and your quiet places by the woods."
"Give me the streets of Manhattan."
I think we are all hopelessly flawed.
He is poor, as one expects of an itinerant philosopher.
Yet I see he is unfailingly generous to all of us.
I am grateful to have a friend.
- Our nation was founded on it.
- It was a betrayal of our ideals.
A constitution that denies basic rights to women and black people?
They've passed the 1 5th amendment.
They can vote.
- black men can vote.
- A lady has no need of suffrage.
- I take wine only medicinaIIy.
- Pretend you've got a cold.
If women are a moral force, can't they govern, preach and testify?
What is it, Miss March?
It's poor logic to say that because women are good they may vote.
Men do not vote because they are good.
Women should vote, not because they are good, but because they are human beings.
- You should have been a lawyer.
- I should have been many things.
- Friedrich?
Oh, I'm sorry ...
- No, please.
Come in.
A newspaper published two of my stories, and they want more.
This is wonderful !
"The daily volcano"?
"The Sinner's Corpse" ...
by Joseph March.
Lunatics ... vampires...
This interests you?
people like thrilling stories.
This is what the newspapers want.
Yes ...
I suppose that is true.
It will buy a new coat for Beth.
She'II be grateful for it.
I do not want to be your teacher.
No, understand me ...
I am saying only that you should please yourself.
My opinion is of no importance.
- Do you forgive me?
- Of course.
Can I make a gift?
Do you Iike the opera?
I do!
I mean, I think I do.
We don't get much opera in Concord.
- I have no opera dress.
- You will be perfect.
Where we are sitting, we shall not be so formal.
LeiIa is a goddess.
She has promised never to love.
If she breaks her vow, all will be lost.
- Look, trouble is coming.
- What will happen?
The inevitable.
LeiIa's soul is opening.
She is drawn to an idea.
He says, "Love has a fatal power."
"Your heart understood mine."
"In the depth of the fragrant night, -
- I listened with ravished soul to your beloved voice."
"Your heart understood mine."
Laurie!
You wicked ...
We heard you were in Greece.
- You are occupied with business?
- Not just now.
Grandfather agreed I should concentrate on music.
- You know Fred Vaughan.
- Good day, Laurence.
I see you're studying art.
Aunt March, you look splendid.
I cannot say the same for you, my boy.
Amy, will you be long?
I must retire.
Do come and see us.
- Are they engaged?
- Not yet.
How long would strychnine take to dissolve in brandy?
Eight minutes?
And is a dagger worn at the waist, or is that a sabre?
In these novels, the dagger is usually concealed in the boot.
By a man with a dark moustache.
Oh Laurie, how lovely!
It isn't what it should be, but you improve it.
Don't.
I liked you better when you were blunt and natural.
It did not serve me well.
I find you changed.
I despise you.
You Iaze about, spending money and courting women.
- You aren't serious about music.
- My music is like your paintings.
Mediocre copies of another man's genius.
Then why not go to Grandfather and make yourself useful?
I should.
Why don't you reform me?
- I've someone else in mind.
- You do not love Fred Vaughan.
- He's stable and weII-mannered ...
- And has 40,000 a year.
I've always known I would not marry a pauper.
- I expect a proposal any day.
- You'II regret it.
I'll regret it.
I'm reminded of a promise.
Didn't I say I would kiss you before you die?
Do you hear from Jo?
She has befriended a German professor.
No doubt he's showing her the ways of the world.
I will not be courted by someone who is still in love with my sister.
- I'm not in love with Jo.
- Then why are you jealous?
I envy her happiness.
I envy his happiness.
I envy John Brooke for marrying Meg.
I hate Fred Vaughan.
If Beth had a lover I'd despise him.
Just as you knew you would never marry a pauper, -
- I have always known I should be part of the March family.
I do not wish to be loved for my family.
Any more than Fred Vaughan wishes to be loved for his 40,000 a year.
My darling Amy, it is you I want, not your family.
I have gone to London to make myself worthy of you.
Please, do not do anything we shall regret.
Monsieur Vaughan, mademoiselle.
May I show him in?
- Friedrich !
Did you read it?
- Yes ...
It's well written, Jo.
The first novel.
What a great accomplishment!
I'II show it to the publisher you know.
He liked "Sinner's Corpse".
What is it?
Mr. fields is a good man.
He will give you an honest opinion.
I see ...
What's your honest opinion?
- I'm a professor of philosophy, Jo.
- I'd Iike to know.
You should be writing from life.
From the depths of your soul.
There is nothing here of the woman I am privileged to know.
Friedrich, this is what I write.
I'm sorry it doesn't live up to your standards.
There is more to you than this, if you have the courage to write it.
Meg !
Jo?
- Why didn't you tell me?
- One hardly speaks of such things.
How wonderful.
- How is Beth?
- You will find her much altered.
Marmee ...
We couldn't send for you sooner.
The doctor's been many times, but it's beyond all of us.
I think she's been waiting for you, before ...
Drink up all this good broth.
- I'm glad you're home.
- So am I .
"Mr. Pickwick changed colour."
"well, that's important.
There's nothing more suspicious, then."
I feel stronger with you close by.
We'II get you better yet.
If God wants me with him, there is none who will stop him.
I don't mind.
I was never like the rest of you ...
making plans to do great things.
I never saw myself as anything much.
I'm not a great writer, Iike you.
- Beth, I'm not a great writer.
- But you will be.
Oh Jo, I've missed you so.
Why does everyone want to go away?
I Iove being home.
But I don't like being left behind.
Now I'm the one going ahead.
I am not afraid.
I can be brave like you.
But I know I shall be homesick for you.
Even in heaven.
I won't let you go.
"Aunt March is bedridden, and would not survive the voyage."
"Amy must bide her time and return later."
It's just as well.
will we never all be together again?
lovely morning.
Thank you, sir.
Dearest Laurie.
You have not heard our sad news of Beth. "
"Meg has entered her confinement, and Amy must stay with Aunt March."
"This is far too great a sorrow to bear alone. "
"Please come home, Teddy dear.
Your faithful Jo. "
Laurie ...
I knew you would come.
The real charm was Beth's happy face at the new piano as she lovingly touched the beautiful keys.
The rumour spread that Amy March had 24 delicious limes.
I said they dressed me up, but not that they made me a fashion plate.
As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet.
An outcry arose.
Her abundant hair was cut short.
Jo, how could you?
Your one beauty.
Nothing's going to change, Jo.
Surprise!
You have a daughter.
And a son.
I can't believe you did this four times.
Yes, but never two at once, my darling.
Daisy ...
Meg, she's so beautiful.
And him !
He's handsome.
He'II look just like his papa.
He does look like John.
- Have you heard from the professor?
- No.
We did not part well.
John and I don't always agree, but then we mend it.
Who could that be?
- Teddy!
This is magic!
- You are absolutely ...
... coveredin flour!
Come in !
Not yet.
May I tell you something, alone?
I'm glad you're the first to know.
May I present ...
... mywife.
brussels lace!
I went to paint the great cathedrals but I couldn't forget our home.
Look how Amy has captured Orchard House.
It's beautiful !
Not as beautiful as I wanted, but I am still learning.
Dear little angel.
Jo, tell me the truth, as a sister, which is a relationship stronger than marriage ...
- Do you mind at all?
- Oh, no.
I was surprised.
I was told that Teddy would never love another, and now he's married.
It's good to hear you call me "Teddy" again.
At last we're all family, as we always should have been.
Promise to live close by.
I couldn't bear losing another sister.
Jo, it's so gloomy and chilly.
It would take an income just for the coal.
What was she thinking?
Most likely she felt sorry for me.
"Decrepit homeless spinster".
Poor Aunt.
Living all those years alone in this ... uselessoldhouse.
Yes, her blessings became a burden.
WouIdn't this be a wonderful school?
What a challenge that would be!
hello, Tuppy.
My book!
Someone's publishing my book!
Hannah !
Someone's publishing my book.
How did it arrive?
A foreign gentleman brought it.
Strange kind of name ...
- "Fox" or "Bear" ...
- Did you ask him to wait?
I thought it was one of Miss Amy's European friends ...
I said Miss March and Mr. Laurie lived next door.
He said he had a train to catch.
Friedrich !
Thank you for my book.
When I didn't hear from you I thought you hated it.
Reading it was like opening a window to your heart.
James fields took it and would not give it back.
I said, "Such news I have to give to her myself."
- well, it was a silly impulse.
- No, not silly at all.
It's so good to see you.
Come and meet my family.
Thank you, but I have to catch a train.
I'm going to the West.
My ship leaves from Boston tomorrow.
The schools in the West are young.
They need professors, and ...
... they'renotconcerned about the accent.
I don't mind it, either.
My aunt left me PIumfieId.
It isn't a field.
It's a rather large house.
AII it's good for is a school.
And I want a good school.
One that's open to anyone who wants to Iearn.
I'II be needing someone who knows how to teach.
- could I not persuade you to stay?
- I confess ...
I was hoping I might have a reason to stay, but ...
congratulations on your marriage.
Oh, no!
That's Amy.
My sister, Amy, and Laurie.
I'm not married.
- please don't go so far away.
- Jo ...
Such a little name for ...
such a person.
will you have me?
With all of my heart.
But I have nothing to give you.
My hands are empty.
They're not empty now.
Terry, I know I haven't worked here very long but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance on my salary?
An advance?
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family.
See, every year, we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket but I've sort of started this whole independent thing, you know which is actually why I took this "job."
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart.
You're a terrible, terrible waitress.
Really, really awful.
Okay, I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.
Um...
But I'm trying really hard, and I think I'm doing better.
I really do.
Does anybody need coffee?
MAN:
Yeah, over here.
WOMAN:
Yeah, I do.
Heh.
Look at that.
Excuse me, sir?
Hi.
You come in here all the time.
MAN:
Uh-huh.
- I was just wondering you think there's a possibility you could give me an advance on my tips?
Huh?
No.
RACHEL:
Okay, okay.
That's fine, fine.
Sorry about that spill before.
[SIGHS]
Only 98.50 to go.
- Hey.
Hey.
ROSS CHANDLER:
Hey.
Ross, did you know that Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
What?
No, they're not.
- Yes, they are.
The Blymans invited them.
- You're wrong.
- I am not wrong.
- You're wrong.
No, I just talked to them.
I'm calling Mom.
- Hey, hey.
MONICA CHANDLER:
Hey.
- Hey.
- Coffee.
And this from the Cry for Help Department:
Are you wearing makeup?
Yes, I am.
As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor/model.
Thank you.
That's funny, I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man/woman.
What were you modeling for?
You know those posters for the City Free Clinic?
Oh, wow.
You're gonna be one of those healthy, healthy, healthy guys?
- Ah?
- The asthma guy's really cute.
- Oh, he is.
RACHEL:
Isn't he?
- You know which one you're gonna be?
- No, no.
But I hear Lyme disease is open, so, you know...
Good luck, man.
I hope you get it.
Thanks.
Well, you were right.
How can they do this to us, huh?
It's Thanksgiving.
Aw.
Tell you what.
How about if I cook dinner at my place?
I'll make it just like Mom's.
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
You know they're not actually supposed to...?
I'll work on the lumps.
- Joey, you're going home, right?
- Yeah.
And I assume, Chandler, you're still boycotting all the Pilgrim holidays?
Yes, every single one of them.
Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
Yeah, and her boyfriend.
But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December because he's lunar.
So you're free Thursday, then?
- Yeah.
Oh, can I come?
- Yeah.
Rach, you still thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Absolutely.
Shoop, shoop, shoop.
- Only $102 to go.
- I thought it was 98.50.
Yeah, well, it was, but I broke a cup.
Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife and will probably wanna bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
[SUSAN CHUCKLES]
Hi.
Is Carol here?
- No, she's at a faculty meeting.
- Oh.
Well, I just came by to pick up my skull.
Well, not mine, but...
- Come in.
- Thanks.
Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
What's it look like?
Kind of like a big face without skin.
Yes, heh, I'm familiar with the concept.
- We can just look for it.
- Okay.
Wow, you guys, heh, sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian.
Well, you know, you have to take a course.
Otherwise they don't let you do it.
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle.
A classic.
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
[CHUCKLES]
The baby that hasn't been born yet?
Uh, wouldn't that mean you're crazy?
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
You're not serious.
I mean, you really talk to it?
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.
Do you, uh...?
Do you talk about me?
- Yeah, yeah.
All the time.
- Really?
But, um, we just refer to you as "Bobo the sperm guy."
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think I should get some belly time too.
I mean, not that I believe any of this.
Oh, I believe it.
I think the baby can totally hear everything.
- Really?
- I can show you.
This will seem a little weird.
But you put your head inside this turkey and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
I'd just like to say I'm totally behind this experiment.
In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
ROSS:
Hey.
MONICA:
Hey, Rach.
- Did you make your money?
RACHEL:
No, not even close.
Forget Vail.
Forget seeing my family.
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Uh, Rach here's your mail.
Thanks.
You can just put it on the table.
Heh.
No.
Here's your mail.
Thanks.
You can just put it on the table.
Would you just open it?
Oh, my God.
- Oh, you guys are great.
- Aw.
Ha, ha.
RACHEL:
Aw.
- We all chipped in.
- We did?
- You owe me 20 bucks.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Chandler, here you go.
Got your traditional holiday feast.
Got your tomato soup your grilled-cheese fixings, and your family-size bag of Funyuns.
Wait, this is what you're having for Thanksgiving dinner?
What is it with you and this holiday?
[SIGHS]
All right, I'm 9 years old.
- Aw.
- Aw, I hate this story.
We've just finished Thanksgiving dinner.
I have...
And I remember this part vividly.
- A mouthful of pumpkin pie.
And this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh, my God.
It's very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Hi.
- We used to work together.
- We did?
Yeah, at Macy's.
You're the Obsession girl, right?
- Yes.
- I was the Aramis guy.
- Aramis?
Aramis?
Aramis?
- Oh.
Yeah, right.
I gotta tell you, you're the best in the business.
- Get out.
JOEY:
I'm serious.
You're amazing.
You know when to spritz.
You know when to lay back.
Really?
You don't know what that means to me.
[CHUCKLES]
Mm, mm.
You smell great tonight.
Uh, what are you wearing?
Nothing.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
Listen, do you wanna go get a drink or something?
Yeah, that would be...
- What's wrong?
- I just remembered I have to do something.
Oh.
What?
Um...
Leave.
JOEY:
Whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.
[GASPS]
[ALL LAUGHING]
[ROSS CLEARS THROAT]
[CHANDLER CLEARS THROAT]
So I guess you all saw it.
- What?
- Saw what?
No, we're just laughing.
You know how laughter can be infectious.
[ALL LAUGHING]
Hey.
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
MONICA:
Mm, looking good.
Okay.
Cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming.
What?
I don't know.
It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Ugh.
All right, that's it.
Get out of my way and stop annoying me.
Well, that's closer.
That's...
I got the ticket, I got the ticket.
Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
Oh, you must stop shooping.
Okay, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Chandler, will you just come in, already?
No, thank you.
I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Look out.
Incoming pumpkin pie.
[MIMICS PLANE ZOOMING]
Okay, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
Hey, Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any Tater Tots.
That's not a question.
But my mom always makes them.
It's like a tradition.
You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a Tot.
I mean, it's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
All right, fine.
Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps and in the form of Tots.
Yes.
All right, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
- Ah.
- Okay, Mom never hit.
[MIXER WHIRRING]
PHOEBE:
Okay, all done.
What?
Phoebe, did you whip the pota...?
Ross needs lumps.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, I just...
I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Why would we do that?
Then they'd be just like my mom used to make it you know, before she died.
Okay, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Okay.
Goodbye, you guys.
Thanks for everything.
Oh, God, look at...
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
The most unbelievable thing has happened.
Underdog has gotten away.
- The balloon?
- No, no, the actual cartoon character.
Of course the balloon.
It's all over the news.
Before he reached Macy's he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park.
- I'm going to the roof.
Who's with me?
- Well, I can't.
I gotta go.
An 80-foot inflatable dog loose over the city?
- How often does that happen?
- Almost never.
- Got the keys?
- Okay.
Any time you're ready.
Okay.
Okay, here we go.
Oh...
Okay, where am I talking to here?
I mean, uh...
Well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Just aim for the bump.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Okay, here goes.
You know, I...
You know, I can't do this.
This is...
It's too weird.
I feel stupid.
All right, so don't do it.
It's fine.
You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hello, baby.
Hello, hello.
- That moment when we first saw the giant dog shadow fall over the park?
But did they have to shoot him down?
I mean, that was just mean.
Okay, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.
Why are we standing here?
We're waiting for you to open the door.
You've got the keys.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
When we left, you said, "Got the keys."
No, I didn't.
I asked, "Got the keys?"
No, no, no.
You said, "Got the keys."
Either of you have the keys?
- The oven is on.
- Oh, I've gotta get my ticket.
- Wait.
We have a copy of your key.
- Well, then get it, get it!
Hey, hey.
That tone won't make me go any faster.
- Joey.
- That one will.
ROSS:
And everyone's telling me:
"You gotta pick a major.
You gotta pick a major."
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.
And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus.
You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Look, you don't have to talk to it.
You can sing to it.
Oh, please.
I am not singing to your stomach, okay?
- How's it going?
ROSS:
Shh, shh, shh.
[SINGING] Here we come
Walkin' down the street
Get the funniest looks from Everyone we meet
Hey, hey...
- Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
- I did.
- Well, does it always, uh...?
- No, no, that was the first.
- Keep singing.
Keep singing.
ROSS:
Oh.
[SINGING] Hey, hey, you're my baby
And I can't wait to meet you
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel And then we'll go to the zoo
[CAROL SUSAN SHRIEK]
I felt it that time.
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy
I'm the one without any breasts
- Nope, not that one.
- Can you go any faster with that?
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys.
You do the math.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
For an emergency just like this.
All right, listen, smirky.
If it wasn't for your stupid balloon I would be on a plane, watching a woman do this right now.
But I'm not.
I swear you said you had the keys.
No.
I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys.
And I obviously did not have the keys.
Okay, all right, that's it.
Enough with the keys.
No one say "keys."
Why would I have the keys?
Aside from the fact that you said you did?
- But I didn't.
- Well, you should have.
MONICA:
Why?
RACHEL:
Because.
Why?
Because everything is my responsibility?
Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner?
Everyone wants a different kind of potato, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes.
You know, does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want?
No, no, no!
You know, just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions and Mario gets his Tots.
[SOBBING IN HIGH VOICE] It's my first Thanksgiving, and I...
It's all burnt, and I can't...
[SOBS]
Okay, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so...
Look, the door's open.
Here we go.
Oh, God.
- Ooh.
- Oh.
Well, the turkey's burnt.
Potatoes are ruined.
Potatoes are ruined.
Potatoes are ruined.
[SINGING] Here we come
Walkin' down the...
[ROSS HUMS]
This doesn't smell like Mom's.
No, it doesn't, does it?
But you wanted lumps, Ross?
Well, here you go, buddy.
You got one.
Oh, God, this is great.
The plane is gone, so I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.
Hey, we all had better plans, okay?
This was nobody's first choice.
Oh, really?
So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
!
- You call that delicious?
- You be quiet!
[ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
All right, stop it, stop it, stop it!
Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.
PHOEBE:
Ew.
- What?
PHOEBE:
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven.
JOEY, ROSS MONICA:
Eh.
PHOEBE:
Oh, my God.
He's not alone.
Ugly Naked Guy is having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
JOEY:
I gotta see this.
ALL:
Aw.
All right, Ugly Naked Guy.
Ooh, ugly naked dancing.
It's nice that he has someone.
Shall I carve?
By all means.
CHANDLER:
All right.
Okay, who wants light cheese and who wants dark cheese?
I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
- Does anybody wanna split this with me?
- Ooh, I will.
Mm.
You guys have to make a wish.
- Make a wish?
- Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.
Ooh.
You got the bigger half.
What did you wish for?
The bigger half.
All right, I'd like to propose a toast.
- A little toast here.
Ding, ding, ding.
ALL:
Mm.
This isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving you planned but for me this has been really great, you know?
I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
I was just thinking, if you'd gone to Vail or if you guys had been with your family, or if you didn't have syphilis and stuff we wouldn't be all together, you know?
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
RACHEL JOEY:
That's so sweet.
RACHEL:
Thank you.
ROSS:
Mm.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
And a crappy New Year.
ALL:
Hear, hear.

Terry, I know I haven't worked here long...
... butI waswondering, would it be possible...
... ifI gota$ 100 advance on my salary?
An advance?
So that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family.
Every year we ski in Vail, and my father pays for my ticket...
... butI 'vestarted this whole independent thing...
... whichisactuallywhy I took this "job. "
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart!
You're a terrible, terrible waitress.
Really, really awful.
I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.
But I'm trying really hard, and I think I'm doing better.
I really do.
Does anybody need coffee?
The One Where Underdog Gets Away
English Subtitles by GELULA CO., INC.
Excuse me, sir?
You come in here all the time.
I was wondering...
... isthereapossibilitythat you could advance me my tips?
That's fine.
Sorry about that spill before!
Only 98.50 to go!
Did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
What?
No, they're not.
The Blymans invited them.
You're wrong.
I am not wrong.
You're wrong.
No, I just talked to them.
I'm calling Mom.
And this from the Cry for Help Department:
Are you wearing makeup?
Yes, I am.
As of today, I'm officially "Joey Tribbiani: actor/model. "
I was thinking you look more like "Joey Tribbiani...
... man/woman."
What were you modeling?
You know those posters for the City Free Clinic?
So you're gonna be one of those healthy, healthy, healthy guys?
The asthma guy's really cute.
Know which one you're gonna be?
But I hear Lyme disease is open, so... .
Good luck, man.
I hope you get it.
Thanks.
You were right.
How can they do this to us?
It's Thanksgiving!
How about if I cook dinner at my place?
I'll make it just like Mom's.
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
They're not actually supposed to--
I'll work on the lumps.
Joey, you're going home, right?
Chandler, you're still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays?
Yes.
Every single one of them.
-Phoebe, you'll be with your grandma?
-And her boyfriend.
But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December because he's lunar.
So you're free Thursday, then?
Yeah.
Oh, can I come?
Rach, you still going to Vail?
Absolutely.
Shoop, shoop, shoop!
Only $ 1 02 to go.
I thought it was 98.50?
Well, it was, but I broke a cup.
Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife...
... andwillprobablywanttobring her ooh, ooh, lesbian life-partner.
Is Carol here?
No, she's at a faculty meeting.
I just came by to pick up my skull.
Well, not mine, but... .
Come in.
Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
What's it look like?
Kind of like a big face without skin.
I'm familiar with the concept.
You can just look for it.
You guys sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian.
You know, you have to take a course.
Otherwise they don't let you do it.
Yertle the Turtle!
A classic.
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
The baby that hasn't been born yet?
Wouldn't that mean you're...
... crazy?
What?
You don't think they can hear sounds in there?
You're not serious?
I mean...
... youreallytalktoit?
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.
Do you talk about me?
All the time.
Really?
We just refer to you as "Bobo, the sperm guy. "
If she's talking to it, I just think I should get some belly-time too.
Not that I believe any of this.
I believe it.
I think the baby can totally hear everything.
I'll show you.
This will seem a little weird.
But you put your head inside this turkey...
... andwe'llalltalkandyou'll hear everything we say.
I'd just like to say I'm totally behind this experiment.
In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
-Did you make your money?
-Not even close.
Forget Vail.
Forget seeing my family.
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Here's your mail.
Thanks.
You can just put it on the table.
Here's your mail!
Thanks.
You can just put it on the table!
Would you just open it!
Oh, my God!
You guys are great!
We all chipped in.
We did?
You owe me $20.
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
Chandler, here you go.
Your traditional holiday feast.
Tomato soup...
... grilled-cheesefixingsand your family-size bag of Funyuns.
This is your Thanksgiving dinner?
What is it with you and this holiday?
I'm 9 years old.
I hate this story!
We've just finished Thanksgiving dinner.
I have-
- I remember this part vividly- -a mouthful of pumpkin pie.
And this is the moment my parents tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh, my God!
Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
We used to work together.
We did?
At Macy's.
You're the Obsession girl, right?
I was the Aramis guy.
Aramis?
Aramis?
Yeah, right!
You're the best in the business.
-Get out!
-I'm serious!
You're amazing!
You know when to spritz.
You know when to lay back.
Really?
You don't know what that means to me.
You smell great tonight.
What are you wearing?
Nothing.
Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?
Yeah, that would be--
-What's wrong?
-I remembered I have to do something.
What?
Leave.
Wait, wait, wait!
I guess you all saw it.
Saw what?
We're just laughing.
You know how laughter can be infectious.
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.
"Tonight, on a very special Blossom. "
Looking good!
Okay!
Cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming... .
What?
I don't know.
It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
That's it.
Get out of my way and stop annoying me!
Well, that's closer.
I got the tickets!
Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop!
Oh, you must stop shooping.
I'm gonna get my stuff.
Will you just come in, already?
I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Look out!
Incoming pumpkin pie!
We all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny.
Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any Tater Tots.
That's not a question.
But my mom always makes them.
It's a tradition.
A piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce and a Tot!
I mean it's...
... badenoughIcan 'tbewith my family, because of my disease.
All right.
Fine.
Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps...
... andintheformofTots.
I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Mom never hit.
Okay, all done.
Phoebe, did you whip the pota--?
Ross needs lumps!
Oh, I'm sorry!
I just--
I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Why would we do that?
Then they'd be like my mom used to make it...
... beforeshedied.
Three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Goodbye, you guys!
Thanks for everything!
Oh, God, look at-
- Sorry!
I'm so sorry.
The most unbelievable thing has happened!
Underdog has gotten away!
The balloon?
No, the actual cartoon character.
Of course the balloon!
It's all over the news.
He broke free and was spotted over Washington Square Park.
I'm going to the roof.
Who's with me?
I can't.
I gotta go!
An 80-foot dog loose over the city?
How often does that happen?
Almost never.
Got the keys?
Anytime you're ready!
Okay, here we go.
Where am I talking to here?
There is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but... .
Just aim for the bump.
Okay, here goes.
You know, I can't do this.
It's too weird.
I feel stupid.
It's fine.
You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hello, baby!

Right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.
Why are we standing here?
We're waiting for you to open the door.
You've got the keys.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
When we left, you said, "Got the keys."
No, I didn't.
I asked "Got the keys?"
You said, "Got the keys!"
Either of you have the keys?
The oven is on!
I've gotta get my ticket!
Wait!
We have a copy of your key.
Then get it!
That tone won't make me go any faster.
That one will.
And everyone's telling me, "You gotta pick a major!"
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.
And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus.
You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
You don't have to talk to it.
You can sing to it.
Please.
I am not singing to your stomach.
How's it going?
Here we come
Walking down the street
Get the funniest looks from Everyone we meet
Hey, hey--
-Did you feel that?
-I did.
-Does it always--?
-That was the first!
IKeep singing!
IKeep singing!
Hey, hey, you're my baby
And I can't wait to meet you
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel And then we'll go to the zoo
I felt it that time!
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy
I'm the one without any breasts
Not that one.
Can you go any faster?
I got one keyhole and a zillion keys!
You do the math.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
For an emergency just like this.
All right.
Listen, smirky!
If it wasn't for your stupid balloon I'd be on a plane watching a woman do this right now.
But I'm not!
I swear you said you had the keys!
I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys!
I obviously did not have the keys!
That's it!
Enough with the keys.
No one say "keys"!
Why would I have the keys!
Besides the fact that you said you did?
-But I didn't!
-Well, you should have.
-Why?
-Because!
Because everything's my responsibility?
Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner?
Everyone wants a different potato, so I'm making different potatoes.
Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want?
Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions and Mario gets his Tots.
It's my first Thanksgiving, and l--
It's all burnt, and I can't....
Monica, only dogs can hear you now.
Look, the door's open!
Here we go.
The turkey's burnt!
Potatoes are ruined!
Potatoes are ruined!
Potatoes are ruined!
Here we come
Walking down the--
This doesn't smell like Mom's.
It doesn't, does it?
But you wanted lumps.
Well, here you go, buddy.
You got one!
God, this is great!
The plane is gone, so I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.
We all had better plans, okay?
This was nobody's first choice!
Oh, really?
So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious dinner?
You call that delicious?
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.
What?
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven.
Oh, my God!
He's not alone.
Ugly Naked Guy is having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
I gotta see this!
All right, Ugly Naked Guy!
Ugly naked dancing!
It's nice that he has someone.
Shall I carve?
By all means.
Who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
I don't even want to know about the dark cheese.
-Does anybody want to split this?
-I will.
You guys have to make a wish.
Make a wish?
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.
You got the bigger half!
What did you wish for?
The bigger half.
All right, I'd like to propose a toast.
A little toast here.
Ding, ding!
This isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving you planned but for me this has been really great.
I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
If you had gone to Vail or if you had been with your family, or if you didn't have syphilis and stuff we wouldn't be all together.
So I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
-That's so sweet!
-Thank you.
Here's to a lousy Christmas!
And a crappy New Year!
Terry, I know I haven't worked here long...
... butI waswondering, would it be possible...
... ifI gota$ 1 00advance on my salary?
An advance?
So that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family.
Every year we ski in vail, and my father pays for my ticket...
... butI 'vestarted this whole independent thing...
... whichisactuallywhy I took this " job. "
rachel, rachel, sweetheart!
You're a terrible, terrible waitress.
really, really awful.
I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.
But I'm trying really hard, and I think I'm doing better.
I really do.
Does anybody need coffee?
The One Where Underdog Gets Away
english subtitles by GELULA CO., INC.
Excuse me, sir?
You come in here all the time.
I was wondering...
... isthereapossibilitythat you could advance me my tips?
That's fine.
Sorry about that spill before!
only 98.50 to go!
Did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
What?
No, they're not.
The BIymans invited them.
You're wrong.
I am not wrong.
You're wrong.
No, I just talked to them.
I'm calling Mom.
And this from the Cry for help Department:
Are you wearing makeup?
Yes, I am.
As of today, I'm officially "Joey Tribbiani: actor/model. "
I was thinking you look more like " Joey Tribbiani...
... man/woman."
What were you modeling?
You know those posters for the City Free clinic?
So you're gonna be one of those healthy, healthy, healthy guys?
The asthma guy's really cute.
Know which one you're gonna be?
But I hear Lyme disease is open, so... .
Good luck, man.
I hope you get it.
Thanks.
You were right.
How can they do this to us?
It's Thanksgiving!
How about if I cook dinner at my place?
I'II make it just like Mom's.
will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
They're not actually supposed to--
I'II work on the lumps.
Joey, you're going home, right?
chandler, you're still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays?
Yes.
Every single one of them.
-Phoebe, you'II be with your grandma?
-And her boyfriend.
But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December because he's lunar.
So you're free Thursday, then?
Yeah.
Oh, can I come?
Rach, you still going to vali?
absolutely.
Shoop, shoop, shoop!
only $ 1 02 to go.
I thought it was 98.50?
well, it was, but I broke a cup.
well, I'm off to carol's.
Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife...
... andwillprobablywanttobring her ooh, ooh, lesbian Iife-partner.
Is carol here?
No, she's at a faculty meeting.
I just came by to pick up my skull.
well, not mine, but... .
Come in.
carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
What's it look like?
Kind of like a big face without skin.
I'm familiar with the concept.
You can just look for it.
You guys sure have a Iot of books about being a lesbian.
You know, you have to take a course.
Otherwise they don't let you do it.
Yertle the Turtle!
A classic.
actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
The baby that hasn't been born yet?
WouIdn't that mean you're...
... crazy?
What?
You don't think they can hear sounds in there?
You're not serious?
I mean...
... youreallytalktoit?
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.
Do you talk about me?
AII the time.
really?
We just refer to you as " Bobo, the sperm guy. "
If she's talking to it, I just think I should get some beIIy-time too.
Not that I believe any of this.
I believe it.
I think the baby can totally hear everything.
I'II show you.
This will seem a little weird.
But you put your head inside this turkey...
... andwe'IIalltalkandyou'II hear everything we say.
I'd just like to say I'm totally behind this experiment.
In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
-Did you make your money?
-Not even close.
Forget VaiI.
Forget seeing my family.
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Here's your mail.
Thanks.
You can just put it on the table.
Here's your mail!
Thanks.
You can just put it on the table!
would you just open it!
Oh, my God!
You guys are great!
We all chipped in.
We did?
You owe me $20.
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
chandler, here you go.
Your traditional holiday feast.
Tomato soup...
... griIIed-cheesefixingsand your famiIy-size bag of Funyuns.
This is your Thanksgiving dinner?
What is it with you and this holiday?
I'm 9 years old.
I hate this story!
We've just finished Thanksgiving dinner.
I have-
- I remember this part vividIy- -a mouthful of pumpkin pie.
And this is the moment my parents tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh, my God!
Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
We used to work together.
We did?
At Macy's.
You're the Obsession girl, right?
I was the Aramis guy.
Aramis?
Aramis?
Yeah, right!
You're the best in the business.
-Get out!
-I'm serious!
You're amazing!
You know when to spritz.
You know when to lay back.
really?
You don't know what that means to me.
You smell great tonight.
What are you wearing?
Nothing.
Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?
Yeah, that would be--
-What's wrong?
-I remembered I have to do something.
What?
Leave.
Wait, wait, wait!
I guess you all saw it.
Saw what?
We're just laughing.
You know how laughter can be infectious.
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.
"Tonight, on a very special Blossom. "
Looking good!
Okay!
Cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming... .
What?
I don't know.
It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
That's it.
Get out of my way and stop annoying me!
well, that's closer.
I got the tickets!
Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop!
Oh, you must stop shooping.
I'm gonna get my stuff.
will you just come in, already?
I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Look out!
Incoming pumpkin pie!
We all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny.
Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any Tater Tots.
That's not a question.
But my mom always makes them.
It's a tradition.
A piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce and a Tot!
I mean it's...
... badenoughIcan 'tbewith my family, because of my disease.
AII right.
Fine.
Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps...
... andintheformofTots.
I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Mom never hit.
Okay, all done.
Phoebe, did you whip the pota--?
Ross needs Iumps!
Oh, I'm sorry!
I just--
I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Why would we do that?
Then they'd be like my mom used to make it...
... beforeshedied.
Three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Goodbye, you guys!
Thanks for everything!
Oh, God, look at-
- Sorry!
I'm so sorry.
The most unbelievable thing has happened!
Underdog has gotten away!
The balloon?
No, the actual cartoon character.
Of course the balloon!
It's all over the news.
He broke free and was spotted over Washington Square Park.
I'm going to the roof.
Who's with me?
I can't.
I gotta go!
An 80-foot dog loose over the city?
How often does that happen?
almost never.
Got the keys?
Anytime you're ready!
Okay, here we go.
Where am I talking to here?
There is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but... .
Just aim for the bump.
Okay, here goes.
You know, I can't do this.
It's too weird.
I feel stupid.
It's fine.
You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
hello, baby!
--the moment we first saw the giant dog shadow fall over the park!
But did they have to shoot him down?
That was just mean.
Right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside...
... andjuicyon theinside.

Besides the fact that you said you did?
- But I didn't!
- Well, you should have.
- Why?
- Because!
Because everything's my responsibility?
Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner?
Everyone wants a different potato, so I'm making different potatoes.
Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want?
Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions and Mario gets his Tots.
It's my first Thanksgiving, and I...
It's all burnt, and I can't...
Monica, only dogs can hear you now.
Look, the door's open!
Here we go.
The turkey's burnt!
Potatoes are ruined!
Potatoes are ruined!
Potatoes are ruined!
Here we come
Walking down the...
This doesn't smell like Mom's.
It doesn't, does it?
But you wanted lumps.
Well, here you go, buddy.
You got one!
God, this is great!
The plane is gone, so I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.
We all had better plans, okay?
This was nobody's first choice!
Oh, really?
So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious dinner?
You call that delicious?
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.
What?
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven.
Oh, my God!
He's not alone.
Ugly Naked Guy is having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
I gotta see this!
All right, Ugly Naked Guy!
Ugly naked dancing!
It's nice that he has someone.
Shall I carve?
By all means.
Who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
I don't even want to know about the dark cheese.
- Does anybody want to split this?
- I will.
You guys have to make a wish.
Make a wish?
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.
You got the bigger half!
What did you wish for?
The bigger half.
All right, I'd like to propose a toast.
A little toast here.
Ding, ding!
This isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving you planned but for me this has been really great.
I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
If you had gone to Vail or if you had been with your family, or if you didn't have syphilis and stuff we wouldn't be all together.
So I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
- That's so sweet!
- Thank you.
Here's to a lousy Christmas!
And a crappy New Year!
Terry, I know I haven't worked here very long but would it be possible if I got a $100 advance on my salary?
An advance?
So I can spend Thanksgiving with my family.
Every year we ski in Vail, and my father pays for my ticket.
But I've started this independent thing which is actually why I took this "job."
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart!
You're a terrible, terrible waitress.
Really, really awful.
I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.
But I'm trying really hard, and I think I'm doing better.
I really do.
- Does anybody need coffee?
- Yeah, over here.
Look at that.
The One Where Underdog Gets Away
Excuse me, sir?
Hi.
You come in here all the time.
Do you think there's a possibility that you could advance me my tips?
Okay, okay.
That's fine.
Fine.
Sorry about that spill before!
Only 98.50 to go!
Did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
- What?
No, they're not.
- Yes, the Blymans invited them.
You're wrong.
- I am not wrong.
- You're wrong.
No, I just talked to them.
I'm calling Mom.
- Hey, hey.
- Hey!
And this from the Cry for Help Department:
Are you wearing makeup?
Yes, I am.
As of today, I'm officially Joey T ribbiani, actor/model.
That's funny.
I was thinking you look more like, Joey T ribbiani, man/woman.
- What were you modeling for?
- Posters for the free clinic.
So you're gonna be one of those healthy guys?
- The asthma guy's really cute.
- Know which one you'll be?
No, but I hear Lyme disease is open, so you know....
- Good luck, man.
I hope you get it.
- Thanks.
You were right.
How can they do this?
It's Thanksgiving!
What if I cook dinner at my place?
I'll make it just like Mom's.
Will you make mashed potatoes with the lumps?
They're not actually supposed to I'll work on the lumps.
- Joey, you're going home?
- Yeah.
Chandler, you're still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays?
- Every single one of them.
- Phoebe, you'll be with your grandma?
And her boyfriend.
We're celebrating Thanksgiving in December because he's lunar.
So you're free Thursday then?
- Yeah.
Oh, can I come?
- Yeah.
- Rach, are you gonna make it to Vail?
- Absolutely.
Shoop, shoop, shoop.
- Only $102 to go.
- I thought it was 98. 50?
Yeah, well, it was, but I I broke a cup, so....
- Well, I'm off to Carol's.
- Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife and will want to bring her ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
Hi.
Is Carol here?
- No, she's at a faculty meeting.
- I just came by to pick up my skull.
Well, not mine, but....
- Come in.
- Thanks.
Carol borrowed it, and I have to get it back to the museum.
- What's it look like?
- Kind of like a big face without skin.
Yes.
I'm familiar with the concept.
- We can just look for it.
- Okay.
Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian.
Well, you know, you have to take a course.
Otherwise they don't let you do it.
Hey, Yertle the Turtle!
A classic.
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
The baby that hasn't been born yet?
Wouldn't that mean you're crazy?
You don't think they can hear sounds in there?
You're not serious?
I mean, you really talk to it?
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.
Well, that's just Do you talk about me?
- Yeah.
All the time.
- Really?
But, we just refer to you as "Bobo the Sperm Guy."
If she's talking to it, I just think I should get some belly time too.
Not that I believe this.
I believe it.
I think the baby can hear everything.
- Really?
- I'll show you.
This'll seem weird.
But you put your head inside this turkey and we'll all talk and you'll hear everything we say.
I'd just like to say I'm totally behind this experiment.
In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
- Hey.
- Rach, did you make your money?
No, not even close.
Forget Vail.
Forget seeing my family.
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
- Rach, here's your mail.
- Thanks.
You can put it on the table.
No.
Here's your mail!
Thanks.
You can put it on the table!
Would you just open it!
Oh, my God!
You guys are great!
We all chipped in.
- We did?
- You owe me $20.
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
Chandler, got your traditional holiday feast.
T omato soup grilled-cheese fixings and a family-size bag of Funyuns.
This is your Thanksgiving dinner?
What is it with you and this holiday?
- I'm 9 years old.
- I hate this story!
We've finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
I have a mouthful of pumpkin pie.
And then my parents tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh, my God!
Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
What's this?
I never saw this at Mom's.
- It's a yam.
- Hello....
This isn't a yam.
Yam comes in purple cans.
They don't They don't come in these.
Ross, don't take this the wrong way or anything, but back off.
Hi.
- We used to work together.
- We did?
Yeah, at Macy's.
You're the Obsession girl, right?
- Yes.
- I was the Aramis guy.
- Aramis.
Aramis.
Aramis.
- Yeah, right!
- You're the best in the business.
- Get out.
You're amazing!
You know when to spritz.
You know when to lay back.
Really?
You don't know what that means to me.
You smell great tonight.
What are you wearing?
Nothing.
- Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?
- Yeah, that would be
- What's wrong?
- I have to do something.
What?
- Leave.
- Wait, wait, wait!
So I guess you all saw it.
- What?
- Saw what?
No, we're just laughing.
You know how laughter can be infectious.
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.
"T onight, on a very special Blossom."
Looking good!
Okay!
Cider's mulling, turkey's turkeying, yams are yamming....
What?
I don't know.
It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Get out and stop annoying me!
Oh, that's closer.
I got the tickets!
Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop!
- Oh, you must stop shooping.
- Okay, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Will you come in?
I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Look out!
Incoming pumpkin pie!
We laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny.
Hey, Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any T ator T ots.
- That's not a question.
- My mom makes them.
It's a tradition.
You get a piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce and a T ot!
I mean, it's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
All right.
Fine.
Tonight's potatoes will be mashed, with lumps and in the form of Tots.
All right, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Okay, Mom never hit.
Okay, all done.
Phoebe, did you whip the pota?
Ross needs lumps!
Oh, I'm sorry!
I just
I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Why do that?
Because then they'd be just like my mom used to make it, before she died.
Okay.
Three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Okay.
Goodbye, you guys!
Thanks for everything!
Oh, God, look at Sorry!
I'm so sorry.
An unbelievable thing happened!
Underdog got away!
- The balloon?
- No, no, the actual cartoon character.
Of course the balloon!
He broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park.
- I'm going to the roof.
Who's with me?
- I can't!
An 80-foot dog over the city?
How often does that happen?
Almost never.
- Got the keys?
- Okay.
Anytime you're ready.
Okay.
Okay, here we go.
Okay.
Where am I talking to here?
There is one way that offers a certain acoustical advantage, but....
Just aim for the bump.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, here goes.
You know, I can't do this.
This is
It's too weird.
I feel stupid.
It's fine.
You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hello, baby.
Hello.
Hello.
the moment we first saw the dog shadow fall over the park!
But did they have to shoot him down?
That was just mean.
Right now the turkey should be crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.
Why are we standing here?
We're waiting for you to open the door.
You have the keys.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
When we left, you said, "Got the keys."
No, I didn't.
I asked, "Got the keys?"
No, no, no.
You said, "Got the keys!"
Do either of you have the keys?
- The oven is on!
- I've gotta get my ticket!
- Wait!
We have a copy of your key.
- Get it!
That tone won't make me go any faster.
- Joey.
- That one will.
And everyone's telling me, "You gotta pick a major."
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.
And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, face it, you're a fetus.
You're happy you don't have gills anymore.
You don't have to talk to it.
You can sing
Please.
I am not singing to your stomach, okay?
How's it going?
Here we come
Walking down the street
Get the funniest looks from Everyone we meet
Hey, hey
- Hey, did you just feel that?
- I did.
- Does it always?
- That was the first.
IKeep singing!
IKeep singing!
Hey, hey, you're my baby And I can't wait to meet you
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel Then we 'Il go to the zoo
- It did it again!
- I felt it that time!
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy I'm the one without any breasts
This is great.
It's 5:00.
My plane is pulling away from the gate.
- Maybe you can take a later flight.
- There is none.
- You can go tomorrow.
- T omorrow is not Thanksgiving!
If I'm gonna cheer you up, you have to meet me halfway.
Can you go any faster?
I got one keyhole and a zillion keys!
You do the math.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
For an emergency just like this.
All right.
Listen, smirky!
If not for your stupid balloon, I'd be on a plane watching a woman do this... right now.
But I'm not!
You said you had the keys!
No, I didn't!
I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys!
That's it!
Enough with the keys.
No one say keys!
Why would I have the keys?
!
- Aside from the fact you said you did?
- I didn't!
- You should've.
- Why?
- Because!
- Why?
Everything's my responsibility?
Isn't it enough that I'm making dinner?
Everyone wants a different kind of potato, so I'm making them.
Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want?

God, this is great!
The plane is gone.

We all had better plans.
This was nobody's first choice!
Oh, really?
So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious dinner?

Stop it!

Stop it!
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.

Terry, I know I haven't worked here very long but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance on my salary?
An advance?
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family.
See, every year, we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket but I've sort of started this whole independent thing, you know which is actually why I took this "job."
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart.
You're a terrible, terrible waitress.
Really, really awful.
Okay, I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.

Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife and will probably wanna bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
[SUSAN CHUCKLES]
Hi.
Is Carol here?
- No, she's at a faculty meeting.
- Oh.
Well, I just came by to pick up my skull.
Well, not mine, but...
- Come in.
- Thanks.
Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
What's it look like?
Kind of like a big face without skin.
Yes, heh, I'm familiar with the concept.
- We can just look for it.
- Okay.
Wow, you guys, heh, sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian.
Well, you know, you have to take a course.
Otherwise they don't let you do it.
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle.
A classic.
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
[CHUCKLES]
The baby that hasn't been born yet?
Uh, wouldn't that mean you're crazy?
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
You're not serious.
I mean, you really talk to it?
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.
Do you, uh...?
Do you talk about me?
- Yeah, yeah.
All the time.
- Really?
But, um, we just refer to you as "Bobo the sperm guy."
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think I should get some belly time too.
I mean, not that I believe any of this.
Oh, I believe it.
I think the baby can totally hear everything.
- Really?
- I can show you.
This will seem a little weird.
But you put your head inside this turkey and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
I'd just like to say I'm totally behind this experiment.

Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Chandler, here you go.
Got your traditional holiday feast.
Got your tomato soup your grilled-cheese fixings, and your family-size bag of Funyuns.
Wait, this is what you're having for Thanksgiving dinner?
What is it with you and this holiday?
[SIGHS]
All right, I'm 9 years old.
- Aw.
- Aw, I hate this story.
We've just finished Thanksgiving dinner.
I have...
And I remember this part vividly.
- A mouthful of pumpkin pie.
And this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh, my God.
It's very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Hi.

Yeah, at Macy's.
You're the Obsession girl, right?

- I was the Aramis guy.
- Aramis?
Aramis?
Aramis?
- Oh.
Yeah, right.
I gotta tell you, you're the best in the business.
- Get out.
JOEY:
I'm serious.
You're amazing.
You know when to spritz.
You know when to lay back.
Really?
You don't know what that means to me.
[CHUCKLES]
Mm, mm.
You smell great tonight.
Uh, what are you wearing?
Nothing.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
Listen, do you wanna go get a drink or something?

[ROSS CLEARS THROAT]
[CHANDLER CLEARS THROAT]
So I guess you all saw it.
- What?
- Saw what?
No, we're just laughing.
You know how laughter can be infectious.
[ALL LAUGHING]
Hey.
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
MONICA:
Mm, looking good.
Okay.
Cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming.
What?
I don't know.
It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Ugh.
All right, that's it.
Get out of my way and stop annoying me.
Well, that's closer.
That's...
I got the ticket, I got the ticket.
Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
Oh, you must stop shooping.
Okay, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Chandler, will you just come in, already?
No, thank you.
I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Look out.
Incoming pumpkin pie.
[MIMICS PLANE ZOOMING]
Okay, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
Hey, Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any Tater Tots.
That's not a question.
But my mom always makes them.
It's like a tradition.
You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a Tot.
I mean, it's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
All right, fine.
Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps and in the form of Tots.
Yes.
All right, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
- Ah.
- Okay, Mom never hit.
[MIXER WHIRRING]
PHOEBE:
Okay, all done.
What?
Phoebe, did you whip the pota...?
Ross needs lumps.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, I just...
I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Why would we do that?
Then they'd be just like my mom used to make it you know, before she died.
Okay, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Okay.
Goodbye, you guys.
Thanks for everything.
Oh, God, look at...
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
The most unbelievable thing has happened.
Underdog has gotten away.
- The balloon?
- No, no, the actual cartoon character.
Of course the balloon.
It's all over the news.
Before he reached Macy's he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park.
- I'm going to the roof.
Who's with me?
- Well, I can't.
I gotta go.
An 80-foot inflatable dog loose over the city?
- How often does that happen?
- Almost never.
- Got the keys?
- Okay.
Any time you're ready.
Okay.
Okay, here we go.
Oh...
Okay, where am I talking to here?
I mean, uh...
Well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Just aim for the bump.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Okay, here goes.
You know, I...
You know, I can't do this.
This is...
It's too weird.
I feel stupid.
All right, so don't do it.
It's fine.
You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hello, baby.
Hello, hello.
- That moment when we first saw the giant dog shadow fall over the park?
But did they have to shoot him down?
I mean, that was just mean.
Okay, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.
Why are we standing here?
We're waiting for you to open the door.

- Oh, I've gotta get my ticket.
- Wait.
We have a copy of your key.
- Well, then get it, get it!
Hey, hey.
That tone won't make me go any faster.
- Joey.
- That one will.
ROSS:
And everyone's telling me:
"You gotta pick a major.
You gotta pick a major."
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.
And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus.
You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Look, you don't have to talk to it.
You can sing to it.
Oh, please.
I am not singing to your stomach, okay?
- How's it going?
ROSS:
Shh, shh, shh.
[SINGING] Here we come
Walkin' down the street
Get the funniest looks from Everyone we meet
Hey, hey...
- Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
- I did.
- Well, does it always, uh...?
- No, no, that was the first.
- Keep singing.
Keep singing.
ROSS:
Oh.
[SINGING] Hey, hey, you're my baby
And I can't wait to meet you
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel And then we'll go to the zoo
[CAROL SUSAN SHRIEK]
I felt it that time.
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy
I'm the one without any breasts
- Nope, not that one.
- Can you go any faster with that?
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys.
You do the math.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
For an emergency just like this.
All right, listen, smirky.
If it wasn't for your stupid balloon I would be on a plane, watching a woman do this right now.
But I'm not.
I swear you said you had the keys.
No.
I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys.
And I obviously did not have the keys.
Okay, all right, that's it.
Enough with the keys.
No one say "keys."
Why would I have the keys?
Aside from the fact that you said you did?
- But I didn't.
- Well, you should have.
MONICA:
Why?
RACHEL:
Because.
Why?
Because everything is my responsibility?
Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner?
Everyone wants a different kind of potato, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes.
You know, does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want?
No, no, no!
You know, just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions and Mario gets his Tots.
[SOBBING IN HIGH VOICE] It's my first Thanksgiving, and I...
It's all burnt, and I can't...
[SOBS]
Okay, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so...
Look, the door's open.
Here we go.
Oh, God.
- Ooh.
- Oh.
Well, the turkey's burnt.
Potatoes are ruined.
Potatoes are ruined.
Potatoes are ruined.
[SINGING] Here we come
Walkin' down the...
[ROSS HUMS]
This doesn't smell like Mom's.
No, it doesn't, does it?
But you wanted lumps, Ross?
Well, here you go, buddy.
You got one.
Oh, God, this is great.
The plane is gone, so I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.
Hey, we all had better plans, okay?
This was nobody's first choice.
Oh, really?
So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
!
- You call that delicious?
- You be quiet!
[ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
All right, stop it, stop it, stop it!
Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.
PHOEBE:
Ew.
- What?
PHOEBE:
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven.
JOEY, ROSS MONICA:
Eh.
PHOEBE:
Oh, my God.
He's not alone.
Ugly Naked Guy is having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
JOEY:
I gotta see this.
ALL:
Aw.
All right, Ugly Naked Guy.
Ooh, ugly naked dancing.
It's nice that he has someone.
Shall I carve?
By all means.
CHANDLER:
All right.
Okay, who wants light cheese and who wants dark cheese?
I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
- Does anybody wanna split this with me?
- Ooh, I will.
Mm.
You guys have to make a wish.
- Make a wish?
- Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.
Ooh.
You got the bigger half.
What did you wish for?
The bigger half.
All right, I'd like to propose a toast.
- A little toast here.
Ding, ding, ding.
ALL:
Mm.
This isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving you planned but for me this has been really great, you know?
I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
I was just thinking, if you'd gone to Vail or if you guys had been with your family, or if you didn't have syphilis and stuff we wouldn't be all together, you know?
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
RACHEL JOEY:
That's so sweet.
RACHEL:
Thank you.
ROSS:
Mm.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
And a crappy New Year.
ALL:
Hear, hear.
[English

- SDH]
Terry, I know I haven't worked here very long but would it be possible if I got a $1 00 advance on my salary?
An advance?
So I can spend Thanksgiving with my family.
Every year we ski in Vail, and my father pays for my ticket.
But I've started this independent thing which is actually why I took this "job. "
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart!
You' re a terrible, terrible waitress.
Really, really awful.
I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.
But I'm trying really hard, and I think I'm doing better.
I really do.
-Does anybody need coffee?
-Yeah, over here.
Look at that.
The One Where Underdog Gets Away
Excuse me, sir?
Hi.
You come in here all the time.
Do you think there's a possibility that you could advance me my tips?
Okay, okay.
That's fine.
Fine.
Sorry about that spill before!
Only 98.50 to go!
Did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
-What?
No, they're not.
-Yes, the Blymans invited them.
You' re wrong.
-I am not wrong.
-You' re wrong.
No, I just talked to them.
I' m calling Mom.
-Hey, hey.
-Hey!
And this from the Cry for Help Department:
Are you wearing makeup?
Yes, I am.
As of today, I'm officially Joey T ribbiani, actor/model.
That's funny.
I was thinking you look more like, Joey T ribbiani, man/woman.
-What were you modeling for?
-Posters for the free clinic.
So you' re gonna be one of those healthy guys?
-The asthma guy's really cute.
-Know which one you'll be?
No, but I hear Lyme disease is open, so you know....
-Good luck, man.
I hope you get it.
-Thanks.
You were right.
How can they do this?
It's Thanksgiving!
What if I cook dinner at my place?
I'll make it just like Mom's.
Will you make mashed potatoes with the lumps?
They're not actually supposed to I'll work on the lumps.
-Joey, you' re going home?
-Yeah.
Chandler, you' re still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays?
-Every single one of them.
-Phoebe, you'll be with your grandma?
And her boyfriend.
We're celebrating Thanksgiving in December because he's lunar.
So you're free Thursday then?
-Yeah.
Oh, can I come?
-Yeah.
-Rach, are you gonna make it to Vail?
-Absolutely.
Shoop, shoop, shoop.
-Only $1 02 to go.
-I thought it was 98. 50?
Yeah, well, it was, but I I broke a cup, so....
-Well, I' m off to Carol's.
-Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife and will want to bring her ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
Hi.
Is Carol here?
-No, she's at a faculty meeting.
-I just came by to pick up my skull.
Well, not mine, but....
-Come in.
-Thanks.
Carol borrowed it, and I have to get it back to the museum.
-What's it look like?
-Kind of like a big face without skin.
Yes.
I'm familiar with the concept.
-We can just look for it.
-Okay.
Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian.
Well, you know, you have to take a course.
Otherwise they don't let you do it.
Hey, Yertle the Turtle!
A classic.
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
The baby that hasn't been born yet?
Wouldn't that mean you're crazy?
You don't think they can hear sounds in there?
You' re not serious?
I mean, you really talk to it?
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.
Well, that's just Do you talk about me?
-Yeah.
All the time.
-Really?
But, we just refer to you as " Bobo the Sperm Guy. "
If she's talking to it, I just think I should get some belly time too.
Not that I believe this.
I believe it.
I think the baby can hear everything.
-Really?
-I'll show you.
This'll seem weird.
But you put your head inside this turkey and we'll all talk and you'll hear everything we say.
I'd just like to say I'm totally behind this experiment.
In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
-Hey.
-Rach, did you make your money?
No, not even close.
Forget Vail.
Forget seeing my family.
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
-Rach, here's your mail.
-Thanks.
You can put it on the table.
No.
Here's your mail!
Thanks.
You can put it on the table!
Would you just open it!
Oh, my God!
You guys are great!
We all chipped in.
-We did?
-You owe me $20.
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
Chandler, got your traditional holiday feast.
T omato soup grilled-cheese fixings and a family-size bag of Funyuns.
This is your Thanksgiving dinner?
What is it with you and this holiday?
-I'm 9 years old.
-I hate this story!
We've finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
I have a mouthful of pumpkin pie.
And then my parents tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh, my God!
Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
What's this?
I never saw this at Mom's.
-It's a yam.
-Hello....
This isn't a yam.
Yam comes in purple cans.
They don't They don't come in these.
Ross, don't take this the wrong way or anything, but back off.
Hi.
-We used to work together.
-We did?
Yeah, at Macy's.
You' re the Obsession girl, right?
-Yes.
-I was the Aramis guy.
-Aramis.
Aramis.
Aramis.
-Yeah, right!
-You' re the best in the business.
-Get out.
You' re amazing!
You know when to spritz.
You know when to lay back.
Really?
You don't know what that means to me.
You smell great tonight.
What are you wearing?
Nothing.
-Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?
-Yeah, that would be
-What's wrong?
-I have to do something.
What?
-Leave.
-Wait, wait, wait!
So I guess you all saw it.
-What?
-Saw what?
No, we' re just laughing.
You know how laughter can be infectious.
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.
"T onight, on a very special Blossom. "
Looking good!
Okay!
Cider's mulling, turkey's turkeying, yams are yamming....
What?
I don't know.
It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Get out and stop annoying me!
Oh, that's closer.
I got the tickets!
Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop!
-Oh, you must stop shooping.
-Okay, I' m gonna get my stuff.
Will you come in?
I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Look out!
Incoming pumpkin pie!
We laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny.
Hey, Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any T ator T ots.
-That's not a question.
-My mom makes them.
It's a tradition.
You get a piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce and a T ot!
I mean, it's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
All right.
Fine.
Tonight's potatoes will be mashed, with lumps and in the form of Tots.
All right, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Okay, Mom never hit.
Okay, all done.
Phoebe, did you whip the pota?
Ross needs lumps!
Oh, I' m sorry!
I just
I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Why do that?
Because then they'd be just like my mom used to make it, before she died.
Okay.
Three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Okay.
Goodbye, you guys!
Thanks for everything!
Oh, God, look at Sorry!
I'm so sorry.
An unbelievable thing happened!
Underdog got away!
-The balloon?
-No, no, the actual cartoon character.
Of course the balloon!
He broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park.
-I'm going to the roof.
Who's with me?
-I can't!
An 80-foot dog over the city?
How often does that happen?
Almost never.
-Got the keys?
-Okay.
Anytime you' re ready.
Okay.
Okay, here we go.
Okay.
Where am I talking to here?
There is one way that offers a certain acoustical advantage, but....
Just aim for the bump.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, here goes.
You know, I can't do this.
This is
It's too weird.
I feel stupid.
It's fine.
You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hello, baby.
Hello.
Hello.
the moment we first saw the dog shadow fall over the park!
But did they have to shoot him down?
That was just mean.
Right now the turkey should be crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.
Why are we standing here?
We're waiting for you to open the door.
You have the keys.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
When we left, you said, "Got the keys. "
No, I didn't.
I asked, "Got the keys? "
No, no, no.
You said, "Got the keys! "
Do either of you have the keys?
-The oven is on!
-I've gotta get my ticket!
-Wait!
We have a copy of your key.
-Get it!
That tone won't make me go any faster.
-Joey.
-That one will.
And everyone's telling me, "You gotta pick a major. "
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.
And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, face it, you' re a fetus.
You're happy you don't have gills anymore.
You don't have to talk to it.
You can sing
Please.
I am not singing to your stomach, okay?

-There is none.
-You can go tomorrow.
-T omorrow is not Thanksgiving!
If I' m gonna cheer you up, you have to meet me halfway.
Can you go any faster?
I got one keyhole and a zillion keys!

For an emergency just like this.

How often does that happen?
Almost never.
-Got the keys?
-Okay.
Anytime you' re ready.
Okay.
Okay, here we go.
Okay.
Where am I talking to here?
There is one way that offers a certain acoustical advantage, but....
Just aim for the bump.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, here goes.
You know, I can't do this.
This is
It's too weird.
I feel stupid.
It's fine.
You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hello, baby.
Hello.
Hello.
the moment we first saw the dog shadow fall over the park!
But did they have to shoot him down?
That was just mean.
Right now the turkey should be crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.
Why are we standing here?
We're waiting for you to open the door.
You have the keys.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
When we left, you said, "Got the keys. "
No, I didn't.
I asked, "Got the keys? "
No, no, no.
You said, "Got the keys! "
Do either of you have the keys?
-The oven is on!
-I've gotta get my ticket!
-Wait!
We have a copy of your key.
-Get it!
That tone won't make me go any faster.
-Joey.
-That one will.
And everyone's telling me, "You gotta pick a major. "
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.
And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, face it, you' re a fetus.
You're happy you don't have gills anymore.
You don't have to talk to it.
You can sing
Please.
I am not singing to your stomach, okay?
How's it going?
Here we come
Walking down the street
Get the funniest looks from Everyone we meet
Hey, hey
-Hey, did you just feel that?
-I did.
-Does it always?
-That was the first.
IKeep singing!
IKeep singing!
Hey, hey, you 're my baby And I can 't wait to meet you
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel Then we 'll go to the zoo
-lt did it again!
-I felt it that time!
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy I'm the one without any breasts
This is great.
It's 5:00.
My plane is pulling away from the gate.
-Maybe you can take a later flight.
-There is none.
-You can go tomorrow.
-T omorrow is not Thanksgiving!
If I' m gonna cheer you up, you have to meet me halfway.
Can you go any faster?
I got one keyhole and a zillion keys!
You do the math.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
For an emergency just like this.
All right.
Listen, smirky!
If not for your stupid balloon, I'd be on a plane watching a woman do this... right now.
But I' m not!
You said you had the keys!
No, I didn't!
I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys!
That's it!
Enough with the keys.
No one say keys!
Why would I have the keys?
!
-Aside from the fact you said you did?
-I didn't!
-You should've.
-Why?
-Because!
-Why?
Everything's my responsibility?
Isn't it enough that I' m making dinner?
Everyone wants a different kind of potato, so I'm making them.
Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want?
No!
No!
No!
Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his T ots
It's my first Thanksgiving, and I
It's all burnt, and I can't....
Monica, only dogs can hear you now.
Look, the door's open.
Here we go.
-All right, Chandler, don't lose this.
-No
Well, the turkey's burnt!
Potatoes are ruined!
Potatoes are ruined!
Potatoes are ruined!
Here we come
Walking down the
This doesn't smell like Mom's.
It doesn't, does it?
You wanted lumps?
Here you go, buddy.
You got one!
-Don't yell at me.
You burned dinner!
-Hey, don't make her squeak again!
God, this is great!
The plane is gone.
I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.
We all had better plans.
This was nobody's first choice!
Oh, really?
So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious dinner?
-You call that delicious?
-You be quiet!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Skiing.
Shoop, shoop, shoop....
Shoop.
-Eww.
-What?
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven.
-Who cares?
-He just sat in gravy.
Oh, my God!
He's not alone.
Ugly Naked Guy is having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
I gotta see this!
All right, Ugly Naked Guy!
Ugly naked dancing!
It's nice that he has someone.
Shall I carve?
-By all means.
-All right.
Who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
I don't even want to know about the dark cheese.
-Does anybody wanna split this?
-I will.
-You guys have to make a wish.
-Make a wish?
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.
You got the bigger half!
What did you wish for?
The bigger half.
All right, I'd like to propose a toast.
A little toast here.
Ding, ding!
This isn't the Thanksgiving you planned but for me, this has been really great.
I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
If you'd gone to Vail or if you had been with your family or if you didn't have syphilis and stuff we wouldn't be together.
I guess what I' m trying to say is that I' m very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
-That's so sweet!
-Thank you.
-Here's to a lousy Christmas!
-And a crappy New Year!
-Hear, hear!
-Hear, hear!
Terry, I know I haven't worked here very long but would it be possible if I got a $100 advance on my salary?
An advance?
So I can spend Thanksgiving with my family.
Every year we ski in Vail, and my father pays for my ticket.
But I've started this independent thing which is actually why I took this "job."
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart!
You're a terrible, terrible waitress.
Really, really awful.
I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.
But I'm trying really hard, and I think I'm doing better.
I really do.
-Does anybody need coffee?
-Yeah, over here.
Look at that.
The One Where Underdog Gets Away
Excuse me, sir?
Hi.
You come in here all the time.
Do you think there's a possibility that you could advance me my tips?
Okay, okay.
That's fine.
Fine.
Sorry about that spill before!
Only 98.50 to go!
Did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
-What?
No, they're not.
-Yes, the Blymans invited them.
You're wrong.
-I am not wrong.
-You're wrong.
No, I just talked to them.
I'm calling Mom.
-Hey, hey.
-Hey!
And this from the Cry for Help Department:
Are you wearing makeup?
Yes, I am.
As of today, I'm officially Joey Tribbiani, actor/model.
That's funny.
I was thinking you look more like, Joey Tribbiani, man/woman.
-What were you modeling for?
-Posters for the free clinic.
So you're gonna be one of those healthy guys?
-The asthma guy's really cute.
-Know which one you'll be?
No, but I hear Lyme disease is open, so you know...
-Good luck, man.
I hope you get it.
-Thanks.
You were right.
How can they do this?
It's Thanksgiving!
What if I cook dinner at my place?
I'll make it just like Mom's.
Will you make mashed potatoes with the lumps?
They're not actually supposed to...
I'll work on the lumps.
-Joey, you're going home?
-Yeah.
Chandler, you're still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays?
-Every single one of them.
-Phoebe, you'll be with your grandma?
And her boyfriend.
We're celebrating Thanksgiving in December because he's lunar.
So you're free Thursday then?
-Yeah.
Oh, can I come?
-Yeah.
-Rach, are you gonna make it to Vail?
-Absolutely.
Shoop, shoop, shoop.
-Only $102 to go.
-I thought it was 98.50?
Yeah, well, it was, but I...
I broke a cup, so...
-Well, I'm off to Carol's.
-Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife and will want to bring her ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
Hi.
Is Carol here?
-No, she's at a faculty meeting.
-I just came by to pick up my skull.
Well, not mine, but...
-Come in.
-Thanks.
Carol borrowed it, and I have to get it back to the museum.
-What's it look like?
-Kind of like a big face without skin.
Yes.
I'm familiar with the concept.
-We can just look for it.
-Okay.
Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian.
Well, you know, you have to take a course.
Otherwise they don't let you do it.
Hey, Yertle the Turtle!
A classic.
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
The baby that hasn't been born yet?
Wouldn't that mean you're crazy?
You don't think they can hear sounds in there?
You're not serious?
I mean, you really talk to it?
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.
Well, that's just...
Do you talk about me?
-Yeah.
All the time.
-Really?
But, we just refer to you as "Bobo the Sperm Guy."
If she's talking to it, I just think I should get some belly time too.
Not that I believe this.
I believe it.
I think the baby can hear everything.
-Really?
-I'll show you.
This'll seem weird.
But you put your head inside this turkey and we'll all talk and you'll hear everything we say.
I'd just like to say I'm totally behind this experiment.
In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
-Hey.
-Rach, did you make your money?
No, not even close.
Forget Vail.
Forget seeing my family.
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
-Rach, here's your mail.
-Thanks.
You can put it on the table.
No.
Here's your mail!
Thanks.
You can put it on the table!
Would you just open it!
Oh, my God!
You guys are great!
We all chipped in.
-We did?
-You owe me $20.
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
Chandler, got your traditional holiday feast.
Tomato soup grilled-cheese fixings and a family-size bag of Funyuns.
This is your Thanksgiving dinner?
What is it with you and this holiday?
-I'm 9 years old.
-I hate this story!
We've finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
I have a mouthful of pumpkin pie.
And then my parents tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh, my God!
Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
What's this?
I never saw this at Mom's.
-It's a yam.
-Hello...
This isn't a yam.
Yam comes in purple cans.
They don't...
They don't come in these.
Ross, don't take this the wrong way or anything, but back off.
Hi.
-We used to work together.
-We did?
Yeah, at Macy's.
You're the Obsession girl, right?
-Yes.
-I was the Aramis guy.
-Aramis.
Aramis.
Aramis.
-Yeah, right!
-You're the best in the business.
-Get out.
You're amazing!
You know when to spritz.
You know when to lay back.
Really?
You don't know what that means to me.
You smell great tonight.
What are you wearing?
Nothing.
-Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?
-Yeah, that would be...
-What's wrong?
-I have to do something.
What?
-Leave.
-Wait, wait, wait!
So I guess you all saw it.
-What?
-Saw what?
No, we're just laughing.
You know how laughter can be infectious.
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.
"Tonight, on a very special Blossom."
Looking good!
Okay!
Cider's mulling, turkey's turkeying, yams are yamming...
What?
I don't know.
It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Get out and stop annoying me!
Oh, that's closer.
I got the tickets!
Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop!
-Oh, you must stop shooping.
-Okay, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Will you come in?
I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Look out!
Incoming pumpkin pie!
We laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny.
Hey, Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any Tator Tots.
-That's not a question.
-My mom makes them.
It's a tradition.
You get a piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce and a Tot!
I mean, it's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
All right.
Fine.
Tonight's potatoes will be mashed, with lumps and in the form of Tots.
All right, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Okay, Mom never hit.
Okay, all done.
Phoebe, did you whip the pota...?
Ross needs lumps!
Oh, I'm sorry!
I just...
I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Why do that?
Because then they'd be just like my mom used to make it, before she died.
Okay.
Three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Okay.
Goodbye, you guys!
Thanks for everything!
Oh, God, look at...
Sorry!
I'm so sorry.
An unbelievable thing happened!
Underdog got away!
-The balloon?
-No, no, the actual cartoon character.
Of course the balloon!
He broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park.
-I'm going to the roof.
Who's with me?
-I can't!
An 80-foot dog over the city?
How often does that happen?
Almost never.
-Got the keys?
-Okay.
Anytime you're ready.
Okay.
Okay, here we go.
Okay.
Where am I talking to here?
There is one way that offers a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Just aim for the bump.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, here goes.
You know, I can't do this.
This is...
It's too weird.
I feel stupid.
It's fine.
You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.

Season 1 Episode 9 The One Where Underdog Gets Away
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
An advance?
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family.
See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know which is actually why I took this job.
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart.
You're a terrible, terrible waitress.
Really, really awful.
Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'.
I'm with you.
Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard.
And I think I'm doing better.
I really do.
Does anybody need coffee?
(Yeah, over here/Yeah!
...)
Oh, look at that.
So no one told you life was gonna be this way [four claps] Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A. (dead on arrival)
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year but I'll be there for you (When the rain starts to pour)
I'll be there for you (Like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you ('Cause you're there for me too)
Excuse me, sir.
Hi, you come in here all time.
I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
Huh?
Ok, ok, that's fine.
Fine.
Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.
Only $98.50 to go.
Hey/Hey
Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
No, they're not.
Yes, they are.
The Blymens invited them.
You're wrong.
I am not wrong./ You're wrong.
No, I just talked to them.
I'm calling Mom.
Hey, hey.
/ Hey.
And this from the cry-for-help department.
Are you wearing makeup?
Yes, I am.
As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
What were you modeling for?
You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
Do you know which one you're gonna be?
No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...
Good luck, man.
I hope you get it.
Thanks.
Well, you were right.
How can they do this to us, huh?
It's Thanksgiving.
Ok, I'll tell you what.
How about I cook dinner at my place?
I'll make it just like Mom's.
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
You know, they're not actually supposed to have...
I'll work on the lumps.
Joey, you're going home, right?
/ Yeah.
And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Yes, every single one of them.
Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
Yes, and her boyfriend.
But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
So you're free Thursday, then.
Yeah.
Oh, can I come?
Yeah.
Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Absolutely.
Shoop, shoop, shoop.
Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
I thought it was $98.50.
Yeah, well it was.
I, I broke a cup.
Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Ooh, ooh!
Why don't we invite her?
and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
No, she's at a faculty meeting.
Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull.
Well, not mine, but...
Susan
Thanks.
Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
What's it look like?
Kinda like a big face without skin.
Yes, I'm familiar with the concept.
We can just look for it.
Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
Well, you know, you have to take a course.
Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle.
A classic.
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet?
Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.
Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Yeah, yeah, all the time.
Really?
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too.
Not that I believe any of this.
Oh, I believe it.
I think the baby can totally hear everything.
I can show you.
Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment.
In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
No, not even close.
Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Rach, here's your mail.
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
No, here's your mail.
Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Would you just open it?
Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
We all chipped in.
We did?
You owe me 20 bucks.
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixing's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner?
What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
All right, I'm nine years old.
/ Oh, I hate this story.
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh my god.
Yes.
It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Uh, hi.
We uh, we used to work together.
/ We did?
Yeah, at Macy's.
You were the Obsession girl, right?
I was the Aramis guy.
Aramis?
Aramis?
Yeah, right.
I gotta tell you.
You're the best in the business.
/ Get out.
I'm serious.
You're amazing.
You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
Really?
You don't know what that means to me.
Ooh, you smell great tonight.
What're you wearing?
Nothing.
Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
Yeah.
Oh.
What's wrong?
/ I just remembered, I have to do something.
Oh.
What?
/ Um, leave.
Wait, wait, wait!
What Mario isn't telling you...
V.D., you never know who might have it.
*VD : (venereal disease);
So I guess you all saw it.
Saw what?
No, we were just laughing.
You know, how laughter can be infectious.
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.
Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
Mmm, looking good.
Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming.
What?
I don't know.
It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
All right, that's it.
You know what?
Just get out of my way and stop moping.
That's closer.
I got the tickets!
I got the tickets!
Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
Oh, you must stop shooping.
Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Chandler, will you just come in already?
No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
Hey, Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any tater tots.
That's not a question.
But my mom always makes them.
It's like a tradition.
You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot!
It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
All right, fine.
Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Ah!
/ Ok, Mom never hit.
Ok, all done.
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes?
Ross needs lumps!
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Why would we do that?
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Ok, good-bye you guys.
Thanks for everything.Oh, sorry!
Oh, sorry!
The most unbelievable thing has happened.
Underdog has just gotten away.
The balloon?
No, no, the actual cartoon character.
Of course the balloon.
It's all over the news.
Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park.
I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
I can't, I gotta go.
Come on.
An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city.
How often does that happen?
Almost never.
Got the keys...
Anytime you're ready.
Ok, ok, here we go.
Ok, where am I talking to, here?
I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Just aim for the bump.
Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes.
You know, I, you know, can't do this.
Uh, this is too weird.
I feel stupid.
So don't do it, it's fine.
You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hello, baby.
Hello, hello.
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down?
I mean, that was just mean.
Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.
Why are we standing here?
We're waiting for you to open the door.
You got the keys.
No I don't.
Yes, you do.
When we left, you said, "got the keys."
No I didn't.
I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".
Do either of you have the keys?
The oven is on.
/ Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
Well then get it, get it!
That tone will not make me go any faster.
Joey!
/ That one will.
And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major.
So, on a dare, I picked paleontology.
And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus.
You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Look, you don't have to talk to it.
You can sing to it if you want.
Oh, please.
I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Hi, how's it goin?
Shh!
Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet.
Hey, hey!
Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
/ I did.
Does it always, uh--?
/ No, no that was the first.
Keep singing!
Keep singing!
Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you.
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy.
I'm the one without any breasts.
Nope, not that one.
/ Can you go any faster with that?
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys.
You do the math.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
For an emergency just like this.
All right, listen, smirky.
If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now.
But I'm not.
I swear you said you had the keys.
No, I didn't.
I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
Ooh, ok, that's it.
Enough with the keys.
No one say keys.
Why would I have the keys?
Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
But I didn't.
/ Well, you should have.
Why?
/ Because!
Why?
Because everything is my responsibility?
Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone?
You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes.
Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want?
Nooooo, no, no!
Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I...
I...
Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open.
Here we go.
Well, the turkey's burnt.
Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Here we come, walkin' down the?
this doesn't smell like Mom's.
No, it doesn't, does it?
But you wanted lumps, Ross?
Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Oh, god, this is great!
The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Hey, we all had better plans.
This was nobody's first choice.
Oh, really?
So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
You call that delicious?
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Ooh.
/ What?
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven.
Oh my god.
He's not alone.
Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Girl.
I've gotta see this.
All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
It's nice that he has someone.
Shall I carve?
By all means.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Oh, I will.
/ Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
Make a wish?
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.
Ooh, you got the bigger half.
What'd you wish for?
The bigger half.
I'd like to propose a toast.
Little toast here, ding ding.
I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know,
I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
That's so sweet.
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
/ And a crappy New Year.
Here, here!
Bladder Control Problem
Stop Wife Beating
Hemorrhoids?
Winner of 3 Tony Awards...
Terry, I know I haven't worked here very long but would it be possible if I got a $100 advance on my salary?
An advance?
So I can spend Thanksgiving with my family.
Every year we ski in Vail, and my father pays for my ticket.
But I've started this independent thing which is actually why I took this "job."
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart!
You're a terrible, terrible waitress.
Really, really awful.
I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.
But I'm trying really hard, and I think I'm doing better.
I really do.
-Does anybody need coffee?
-Yeah, over here.
Look at that.
The One Where Underdog Gets Away
Excuse me, sir?
Hi.
You come in here all the time.
Do you think there's a possibility that you could advance me my tips?
Okay, okay.
That's fine.
Fine.
Sorry about that spill before!
Only 98.50 to go!
Did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
-What?
No, they're not.
-Yes, the Blymans invited them.
You're wrong.
-l am not wrong.
-You're wrong.
No, I just talked to them.
I'm calling Mom.
-Hey, hey.
-Hey!
And this from the Cry for Help Department:
Are you wearing makeup?
Yes, I am.
As of today, I'm officially Joey Tribbiani, actor/model.
That's funny. I was thinking you look more like, Joey Tribbiani, man/woman.
-What were you modeling for?
-Posters for the free clinic.
So you're gonna be one of those healthy guys?
-The asthma guy's really cute.
-lKnow which one you'll be?
No, but I hear Lyme disease is open, so you know....
-Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
-Thanks.
You were right.
How can they do this?
It's Thanksgiving!
What if I cook dinner at my place?
I'll make it just like Mom's.
Will you make mashed potatoes with the lumps?
They're not actually supposed to-- l'll work on the lumps.
-Joey, you're going home?
-Yeah.
Chandler, you're still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays?
-Every single one of them.
-Phoebe, you'll be with your grandma?
And her boyfriend.
We're celebrating Thanksgiving in December because he's lunar.
So you're free Thursday then?
-Yeah.
Oh, can I come?
-Yeah.
-Rach, are you gonna make it to Vail?
-Absolutely.
Shoop, shoop, shoop.
-Only $102 to go.
-l thought it was 98.50?
Yeah, well, it was, but l-- l broke a cup, so....
-Well, I'm off to Carol's.
-Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife and will want to bring her ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
Hi. ls Carol here?
-No, she's at a faculty meeting.
-l just came by to pick up my skull.
Well, not mine, but....
-Come in.
-Thanks.
Carol borrowed it, and I have to get it back to the museum.
-What's it look like?
-lKind of like a big face without skin.
Yes. I'm familiar with the concept.
-We can just look for it.
-Okay.
Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian.
Well, you know, you have to take a course.
Otherwise they don't let you do it.
Hey, YertIe the turtle!
A classic.
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
The baby that hasn't been born yet?
Wouldn't that mean you're crazy?
You don't think they can hear sounds in there?
You're not serious?
I mean, you really talk to it?
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.
Well, that's just-- Do you talk about me?
-Yeah.
All the time.
-Really?
But, we just refer to you as " Bobo the Sperm Guy."
If she's talking to it, I just think I should get some belly time too.
Not that I believe this.
I believe it. I think the baby can hear everything.
-Really?
-l'll show you.
This'll seem weird.
But you put your head inside this turkey and we'll all talk and you'll hear everything we say.
I'd just like to say I'm totally behind this experiment.
In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
-Hey.
-Rach, did you make your money?
No, not even close.
Forget Vail.
Forget seeing my family.
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
-Rach, here's your mail.
-Thanks.
You can put it on the table.
No.
Here's your mail!
Thanks.
You can put it on the table!
Would you just open it!
Oh, my God!
You guys are great!
We all chipped in.
-We did?
-You owe me $20.
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
Chandler, got your traditional holiday feast.
Tomato soup grilled-cheese fixings and a family-size bag of Funyuns.
This is your Thanksgiving dinner?
What is it with you and this holiday?
-l'm 9 years old.
-l hate this story!
We've finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have a mouthful of pumpkin pie.
And then my parents tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh, my God!
Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
What's this?
I never saw this at Mom's.
-lt's a yam.
-Hello....
This isn't a yam.
Yam comes in purple cans.
They don't-
- They don't come in these.
Ross, don't take this the wrong way or anything, but back off.
Hi.
-We used to work together.
-We did?
Yeah, at Macy's.
You're the Obsession girl, right?
-Yes.
-l was the Aramis guy.
-Aramis.
Aramis.
Aramis.
-Yeah, right!
-You're the best in the business.
-Get out.
You're amazing!
You know when to spritz.
You know when to lay back.
Really?
You don't know what that means to me.
You smell great tonight.
What are you wearing?
Nothing.
-Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?
-Yeah, that would be--
-What's wrong?
-l have to do something.
What?
-Leave.
-Wait, wait, wait!
So I guess you all saw it.
-What?
-Saw what?
No, we're just laughing.
You know how laughter can be infectious.
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.
" Tonight, on a very special blossom. "
Looking good!
Okay!
Cider's mulling, turkey's turkeying, yams are yamming....
What?
I don't know. lt's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Get out and stop annoying me!
Oh, that's closer.
I got the tickets!
Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop!
-Oh, you must stop shooping.
-Okay, I'm gonna get my stuff.
Will you come in?
I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Look out!
Incoming pumpkin pie!
We laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny.
Hey, Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any Tator Tots.

Cider's mulling, turkey's turkeying, yams are yamming....
What?
I don't know.
It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Get out and stop annoying me!
Oh, that's closer.
I got the tickets!
Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop!
-Oh, you must stop shooping.
-Okay, I' m gonna get my stuff.
Will you come in?
I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
Look out!
Incoming pumpkin pie!
We laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny.
Hey, Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any T ator T ots.
-That's not a question.
-My mom makes them.
It's a tradition.
You get a piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce and a T ot!
I mean, it's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
All right.
Fine.
Tonight's potatoes will be mashed, with lumps and in the form of Tots.
All right, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Okay, Mom never hit.
Okay, all done.
Phoebe, did you whip the pota?
Ross needs lumps!
Oh, I' m sorry!
I just
I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Why do that?
Because then they'd be just like my mom used to make it, before she died.
Okay.
Three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Okay.
Goodbye, you guys!
Thanks for everything!
Oh, God, look at Sorry!
I'm so sorry.
An unbelievable thing happened!
Underdog got away!
-The balloon?
-No, no, the actual cartoon character.
Of course the balloon!
He broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park.
-I'm going to the roof.
Who's with me?
-I can't!
An 80-foot dog over the city?
How often does that happen?
Almost never.
-Got the keys?
-Okay.
Anytime you' re ready.
Okay.
Okay, here we go.
Okay.
Where am I talking to here?
There is one way that offers a certain acoustical advantage, but....
Just aim for the bump.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, here goes.
You know, I can't do this.
This is
It's too weird.
I feel stupid.
It's fine.
You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.
Hello, baby.
Hello.
Hello.
the moment we first saw the dog shadow fall over the park!
But did they have to shoot him down?
That was just mean.
Right now the turkey should be crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.
Why are we standing here?
We're waiting for you to open the door.
You have the keys.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
When we left, you said, "Got the keys. "
No, I didn't.
I asked, "Got the keys? "
No, no, no.
You said, "Got the keys! "
Do either of you have the keys?
-The oven is on!
-I've gotta get my ticket!
-Wait!
We have a copy of your key.
-Get it!
That tone won't make me go any faster.
-Joey.
-That one will.
And everyone's telling me, "You gotta pick a major. "
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.
And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, face it, you' re a fetus.
You're happy you don't have gills anymore.
You don't have to talk to it.
You can sing
Please.
I am not singing to your stomach, okay?
How's it going?
Here we come
Walking down the street
Get the funniest looks from Everyone we meet
Hey, hey
-Hey, did you just feel that?
-I did.
-Does it always?
-That was the first.
IKeep singing!
IKeep singing!
Hey, hey, you 're my baby And I can 't wait to meet you
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel Then we 'll go to the zoo
-lt did it again!
-I felt it that time!
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy I'm the one without any breasts
This is great.
It's 5:00.
My plane is pulling away from the gate.
-Maybe you can take a later flight.
-There is none.
-You can go tomorrow.
-T omorrow is not Thanksgiving!
If I' m gonna cheer you up, you have to meet me halfway.
Can you go any faster?
I got one keyhole and a zillion keys!
You do the math.
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
For an emergency just like this.
All right.
Listen, smirky!
If not for your stupid balloon, I'd be on a plane watching a woman do this... right now.
But I' m not!
You said you had the keys!
No, I didn't!
I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys!
That's it!
Enough with the keys.
No one say keys!
Why would I have the keys?
!
-Aside from the fact you said you did?
-I didn't!
-You should've.
-Why?
-Because!
-Why?
Everything's my responsibility?
Isn't it enough that I' m making dinner?
Everyone wants a different kind of potato, so I'm making them.
Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want?
No!
No!
No!
Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his T ots
It's my first Thanksgiving, and I
It's all burnt, and I can't....
Monica, only dogs can hear you now.
Look, the door's open.
Here we go.
-All right, Chandler, don't lose this.
-No
Well, the turkey's burnt!
Potatoes are ruined!
Potatoes are ruined!
Potatoes are ruined!
Here we come
Walking down the
This doesn't smell like Mom's.
It doesn't, does it?
You wanted lumps?
Here you go, buddy.
You got one!
-Don't yell at me.
You burned dinner!
-Hey, don't make her squeak again!
God, this is great!
The plane is gone.
I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.
We all had better plans.
This was nobody's first choice!
Oh, really?
So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious dinner?
-You call that delicious?
-You be quiet!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Skiing.
Shoop, shoop, shoop....
Shoop.
-Eww.
-What?
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven.
-Who cares?
-He just sat in gravy.
Oh, my God!
He's not alone.
Ugly Naked Guy is having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
I gotta see this!
All right, Ugly Naked Guy!
Ugly naked dancing!
It's nice that he has someone.
Shall I carve?
-By all means.
-All right.
Who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
I don't even want to know about the dark cheese.
-Does anybody wanna split this?
-I will.
-You guys have to make a wish.
-Make a wish?
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.
You got the bigger half!
What did you wish for?
The bigger half.
All right, I'd like to propose a toast.
A little toast here.
Ding, ding!
This isn't the Thanksgiving you planned but for me, this has been really great.
I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
If you'd gone to Vail or if you had been with your family or if you didn't have syphilis and stuff we wouldn't be together.
I guess what I' m trying to say is that I' m very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
-That's so sweet!
-Thank you.
-Here's to a lousy Christmas!
-And a crappy New Year!
-Hear, hear!
-Hear, hear!
Terry, I know I haven't worked here very long but would it be possible if I got a $1 00 advance on my salary?
An advance?
So I can spend Thanksgiving with my family.
Every year we ski in Vail, and my father pays for my ticket.
But I've started this independent thing which is actually why I took this "job. "
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart!
You' re a terrible, terrible waitress.
Really, really awful.
I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.
But I'm trying really hard, and I think I'm doing better.
I really do.
-Does anybody need coffee?
-Yeah, over here.
Look at that.
The One Where Underdog Gets Away
Excuse me, sir?
Hi.
You come in here all the time.
Do you think there's a possibility that you could advance me my tips?
Okay, okay.
That's fine.
Fine.
Sorry about that spill before!
Only 98.50 to go!
Did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
-What?
No, they're not.
-Yes, the Blymans invited them.
You' re wrong.
-I am not wrong.
-You' re wrong.
No, I just talked to them.
I' m calling Mom.
-Hey, hey.
-Hey!
And this from the Cry for Help Department:
Are you wearing makeup?
Yes, I am.
As of today, I'm officially Joey T ribbiani, actor/model.
That's funny.
I was thinking you look more like, Joey T ribbiani, man/woman.
-What were you modeling for?
-Posters for the free clinic.
So you' re gonna be one of those healthy guys?
-The asthma guy's really cute.
-Know which one you'll be?
No, but I hear Lyme disease is open, so you know....
-Good luck, man.
I hope you get it.
-Thanks.
You were right.
How can they do this?
It's Thanksgiving!
What if I cook dinner at my place?
I'll make it just like Mom's.
Will you make mashed potatoes with the lumps?
They're not actually supposed to I'll work on the lumps.
-Joey, you' re going home?
-Yeah.
Chandler, you' re still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays?
-Every single one of them.
-Phoebe, you'll be with your grandma?
And her boyfriend.
We're celebrating Thanksgiving in December because he's lunar.
So you're free Thursday then?
-Yeah.
Oh, can I come?
-Yeah.
-Rach, are you gonna make it to Vail?
-Absolutely.
Shoop, shoop, shoop.
-Only $1 02 to go.
-I thought it was 98. 50?
Yeah, well, it was, but I I broke a cup, so....
-Well, I' m off to Carol's.
-Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife and will want to bring her ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
Hi.
Is Carol here?
-No, she's at a faculty meeting.
-I just came by to pick up my skull.
Well, not mine, but....
-Come in.
-Thanks.
Carol borrowed it, and I have to get it back to the museum.
-What's it look like?
-Kind of like a big face without skin.
Yes.
I'm familiar with the concept.
-We can just look for it.
-Okay.
Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian.
Well, you know, you have to take a course.
Otherwise they don't let you do it.
Hey, Yertle the Turtle!
A classic.
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
The baby that hasn't been born yet?
Wouldn't that mean you're crazy?
You don't think they can hear sounds in there?
You' re not serious?
I mean, you really talk to it?
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.
Well, that's just Do you talk about me?
-Yeah.
All the time.
-Really?
But, we just refer to you as " Bobo the Sperm Guy. "
If she's talking to it, I just think I should get some belly time too.
Not that I believe this.
I believe it.
I think the baby can hear everything.
-Really?
-I'll show you.
This'll seem weird.
But you put your head inside this turkey and we'll all talk and you'll hear everything we say.
I'd just like to say I'm totally behind this experiment.
In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
-Hey.
-Rach, did you make your money?
No, not even close.
Forget Vail.
Forget seeing my family.
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
-Rach, here's your mail.
-Thanks.
You can put it on the table.
No.
Here's your mail!
Thanks.
You can put it on the table!
Would you just open it!
Oh, my God!
You guys are great!
We all chipped in.
-We did?
-You owe me $20.
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
Chandler, got your traditional holiday feast.
T omato soup grilled-cheese fixings and a family-size bag of Funyuns.
This is your Thanksgiving dinner?
What is it with you and this holiday?
-I'm 9 years old.
-I hate this story!
We've finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
I have a mouthful of pumpkin pie.
And then my parents tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh, my God!
Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
What's this?
I never saw this at Mom's.
-It's a yam.
-Hello....
This isn't a yam.
Yam comes in purple cans.
They don't They don't come in these.
Ross, don't take this the wrong way or anything, but back off.
Hi.
-We used to work together.
-We did?
Yeah, at Macy's.
You' re the Obsession girl, right?
-Yes.
-I was the Aramis guy.
-Aramis.
Aramis.
Aramis.
-Yeah, right!
-You' re the best in the business.
-Get out.
You' re amazing!
You know when to spritz.
You know when to lay back.
Really?
You don't know what that means to me.
You smell great tonight.
What are you wearing?
Nothing.
-Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?
-Yeah, that would be
-What's wrong?
-I have to do something.
What?
-Leave.
-Wait, wait, wait!
So I guess you all saw it.
-What?
-Saw what?
No, we' re just laughing.
You know how laughter can be infectious.
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.
"T onight, on a very special Blossom. "
Looking good!
Okay!
Cider's mulling, turkey's turkeying, yams are yamming....
What?
I don't know.
It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.

Ah, that sales clerk was so rude.
Oh, I know.
You ask to try on twenty pairs of shoes, and right away they get an attitude.
Hi, Fran.
Oh, Maggie.
What're you doin' home so early?
Are you sick?
Ah!
I better not catch anything.
I got unemployment tomorrow.
Honey, I feel terrible.
Here I was out shopping, and you were home sick with no one to take care of you.
I beg your pardon.
I'm perfectly capable of taking care of Miss Margaret.
Oh ... actually, I'm not really sick.
It's only ... you know ...
my monthly friend.
She's all yours.
I don't get it.
What's goin' on here?
Val, what comes at the end of a sentence?
A parole?
You might have noticed that Val is not short for valedictorian.
Now, come on.
What gives?
You've had your period four times this month.
So?
/ So, women don't get their period every week.
If they did, all the men in the world would be institutionalized.
Which wouldn't necessarily effect my social life.
Now, what gives?
You're not havin' problems with your boyfriend.
You're not failing any classes.
You're trying to get out of gym.
Oh ...
I have gymnastics this semester.
Ach!
The worst!
Oh, the horse, the bars, the rope.
Oh, I hated the rope.
To this day, I can't even look at an extension cord.
Thank God you know how I feel.
So you'll let me stay home?
No.
Honey, every once in a while you gotta pull up those gym shorts, lace up those high-tops, and face your fears.
Or you could do what Fran did write phony notes.
Val, turn your head sideways a sec.
Did you know you can see clear through your ears?
This is a completely different situation.
She doesn't have our gym teacher.
You know, after World War Two, a lot of Nazis fled down to South America.
She came to P.S. Nineteen.
No, Maggie, I am not writing you a phony excuse.
Oh, c'mon, Fran.
My gym teacher hates me.
She goes out of her way to make me look stupid.
There's a tough job.
/ Oh, shut up, Brighton.
Come on, Fran.
Please.
Just till gymnastics is over.
You've gotta get me through till volleyball.
No, I'm a nanny now.
I took an oath.
Fran, she won't even let me wear make-up in class.
Oh, she's gotta be stopped.
Well, all right, but only because I know what it's like to be a pathetic klutz.
I knew you'd understand.
All right, let's use one of my favorite excuses, and I hope one of yours.
A hammer toe.
A hammer toe?
/ Uh-huh.
What's that?
/ It's a cruel, crippling disease caused by shoving your feet into high heels that are too small.
And if you don't think that sounds painful, just ask my Uncle Harvey.
You know, it won't work.
It ...
it has to be something undetectable.
Something she can't see.
Then it should have something to do with your chest.
Shut up, you little troll.
How 'bout severe depression brought on by feelings of inadequacy and the fear of death?
Gracie, where do you come up with these things?
Usually during hopscotch.
Miss Fein, I'd like next Friday off.
Could you write Mr. Sheffield a note for me?
I think I'd like an attractive disease.
Perhaps something that requires an eye patch.
Niles, would this happen to be your not-so-subtle way of saying you disapprove of me?
Not at all.
I delight in each and every antic.
Just think of me as one of those people who slows down on the highway to view the wreck and then goes on his merry way.
You know, Mags, now I could be wrong here, but ...
I think Dad would be pretty upset if he found out about this whole note thing.
How's he gonna find out?
/ I'm gonna tell him.
Unless you and I can cut a deal.
Listen, you maggot, breathe one word of this to Dad and I'll pull your tongue out through your zipper.
I do believe we have a deal.
Niles, please, I'm trying to work!
As opposed to what I'm doing, which is a hobby?
You wanted to see me, Mr. Sheffield?
/ Oh, yes, Miss Fein.
I got the strangest call today from Maggie's school.
Oh, look, traffic's backing up.
I wonder what's ahead.
Do you know anything about her having a ... a heart murmur?
Heart murmur, heart murmur ....
Murmur of the heart.
No, no, I ...
it doesn't ring a bell.
Well, it seems she's been feigning illness to get out of gym class.
Oh, it's a massive pile-up.
You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you, Miss Fein?
They're going to need the Jaws of Life for this one.
Oh, Miss Babcock, Miss Babcock.
It's so nice to see you.
You know, we gotta spend more time with each other.
Oh, that little rubber band in your head finally snapped.
Maxwell, I have wonderful news.
I think I have solved our casting problem.
What about Alan Beck to play the lead?
Oh, Alan Beck.
I love him.
No, I don't think so.
/ Why would I lie?
Maxwell, Alan Beck is a living legend.
He's won two Academy Awards.
He just won a Tony.
And next he's goin' to Disneyland!
Miss Fein, please.
Alan Beck is a demon.
When I first started in the theater, I ...
I worked as his gopher.
He treated me like dirt.
Oh, he can't be that bad.
One time I forgot to put lemon in his tea.
He set me on fire.
Well, there are two sides to every story.
What's the other side to that?
I was a twenty-year-old boy set ablaze by a madman.
Well, you're not a twenty-year-old boy anymore.
You're a big macha producer.
Yes, but I'm still flammable.
I think I'm at that point in my career where I can choose who I work with.
Alan Beck's name on a marquis can pre-sell a six-month run.
I choose him.
Well, Mr. Sheffield, this is a very big decision you've made.
You know, it was just like I was telling Maggie.
You've got to confront your fears.
Maggie, that's right.
Now ... now what's this about her cutting gym class?
Just when the roadway had finally cleared... some idiot swerved into oncoming traffic.
Oh, Mr. Sheffield ... don't worry about Maggie.
I'll take care of her.
You just get yourself flame retarded and you, keep it movin', keep it movin', there's nothin' to see here.
Oh, wow, does this bring back memories.
Bad memories.
Oh, the ring.
Good ol' ring ....
I have no use for rings unless someone's puttin' one on my finger.
This was my event.
/ What'd you do on that?
Ah, nevermind.
Fran, I'm dead.
What're we gonna say?
Well, then just tell her the truth.
That your pacemaker's workin' perfectly.
God, it's not gonna work.
Coach Stone is gonna torture me this whole semester.
Oh, honey, you're makin' a big deal over what lasts a grand total of four minutes.
What are you talking about?
Gym class lasts forty-five minutes.
Listen and learn.
First you gotta get dressed.
Take your time.
You're not a fireman.
Now you volunteer to get the equipment, which is very heavy.
So you pull something.
It could be a side ache, a charley-horse, a hernia, depending on how much time you need.
Twelve minutes.
God, I was good.
What're we down to?
/ I have twenty minutes.
All right, just enough time to look for your contact.
Fran, you don't wear contacts.
/ Exactly.
Do you know how long it takes to find a contact that doesn't exist?
Sixteen minutes, which brings us down to a grand total of four minutes.
It's a cinch.
Anyone could get through four minutes of gym, even if you had my old teacher, Miss Wickervich.
We used to call her the Wickervich of the West.
... Ah ....
Hello, Fein.
/ Miss Wickervich!
Long time no see.
/ Your old gym teacher's my gym teacher?
Small world. / Ah, nobody move.
I think I've lost my contacts.
Well, Fein, I see you've recovered from the series of ailments that plagued you as a teenager, huh?
Well, I still got some of the old shoulder mishagas.
You know, when it's damp ....
Meanwhile, you look fabulous.
Why'd you change your name?
I got married.
/ To a man?
So you're married and I'm not?
How could this be?
I'll tell you how.
You're soft.
You were soft then ...
and you're soft now.
And you're raising soft children with heart murmurs.
Is any of this gonna affect my grade?
/ Oh, you bet your soft, squishy little butt.
If you don't pass those midterms next week, your grade is an "F."
But that's not fair.
/ Ah, life is not fair.
Ask the old maid.
Don't worry, Maggie, you're gonna pass that test 'cause I'm gonna coach you.
You!
?
Ha ... ha ... ha ....
Oh, that's so rich.
You're like a French Poodle.
You're all poofy and perfect.
But let 'em down and what do you got?
A wet poodle?
I'm gonna make her suffer.
I'm gonna torture you so bad you are going to beg me to kill you.
You know, marriage has mellowed her.
Where the hell is Alan Beck?
First day of rehearsals and we're already two hours behind.
Everybody out!
There's a bomb threat!
We're threatening to open with this plot ....
No explosion.
It's worse than a bomb.
It's a dud.
Who are you?
/ Maxwell Sheffield.
You look familiar.
/ Yeah, well ... we ... worked together some time ago in London.
I was your assistant.
Good.
Get me some coffee.
/ Actually, I'm the producer now.
With cream.
Who are you, blondie?
I'm C.C. Babcock.
I'm Mr. Sheffield's business associate.
Yeah, I got a slew of those myself.
But I got Thursday open.
I'll be in my dressing room, Sheffield.
/ Oh, Mr. Sheffield ....
Whoa.
And who is this lovely creature?
Put Thursday on hold, blondie.
Oh, Alan Beck, I just love you!
Oh, then we have a lot in common.
You must be my leading lady.
/ Oh, no.
I'm Fran Fein, the nanny.
Some nanny.
You know, there's a little boy inside me.
Wanna raise him?
Well, what's the problem?
I think he's very charming.
Well, thank you for your professional opinion, Miss Fein.
So how did your meeting with Maggie's gym teacher go?
Oh, great.
I talked her into giving Maggie a make-up test.
I'll need a credit card.
/ Oh, yeah
Wait a minute, do you intend to bribe her?
/ No.
But only 'cause I didn't think of it first.
So ...?
/ New exercise outfit.
My grandpa always said, "You must look your best."
He insisted on being buried in a tuxedo.
Unfortunately, it was a rental, which could be the reason for my family's horrible credit rating.
Sheffield!
/ Oh, God, what now?
More coffee?
I've been re-thinking act two.
It's a downer.
You got my character in a wheelchair.
What woman in the audience is gonna believe that Alan Beck is paralyzed from the waist down?
Alan, you're playing Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
The man was a paraplegic.
Find a cure.
You call that a backhand spring layout?
Shape up!
I've seen better routines in gymboree.
You old Mary Lou Rotten ....
Well, look who's here.
Olga Naudia.
Have a good practice, girls?
I have to get home to dinner.
A romantic dinner ... with my husband.
You know what that's like, don't you, Fran?
Oh, that's right.
You don't.
Oh, forget her.
We'll show her.
Are you ready?
/ I'm ready.
Are you really ready?
/ I'm really ready.
I can't hear you, Sheffield!
/ I'm really ready!
All right, then, let's go!
Ow!
Tea time.
Are we feeling any better?
Do I look like I'm feeling any better?
A woman with an electrical appliance around her neck and her feet in water should remember who her friends are.
Ow!
Ah!
Oy!
Listen to me.
I sound like a kevetchy Kathy doll.
God, I hate dealing with actors!
They ruin the theater.
May I get you something, sir?
Scotch and soda?
Gin and tonic?
Martini?
Yes.
I wonder if Flo Zeigfeld had all these problems.
I think his problems started when they named him Flo.
Oh, good, I haven't missed happy hour.
Oh ....
That Alan Beck'll be the death of me yet.
He insists on playing FDR as a swash-buckling paraplegic who leaps out of his wheelchair at will, screaming, "It's a miracle."
Well, if you want him to stay in his chair, I know someone that could break his legs.
Ow!
And she wears sneakers so he'll never hear her coming.
I take it all is not well in the olympic village.
Who would have thought that we'd both be facing demons from our past.
I can't believe I'd hire a paramaniacal sociopath.
Yeah, well, that was pretty stupid.
Mine was just a coincidence.
Ah, come on, Miss Fein.
Why don't you just stand up to her?
You're not in high school anymore.
You're a big macha nanny ....
Oh, no, let me.
/ Thank you.
Well, why don't you take some of your own advice?
I mean, if the guy's making you miserable, why don't you just stand up to him?
Because he'll quit ... and he's brilliant.
Nah, the worst that'll happen is he'll set you on fire again.
How many times can he do that before it gets old?
Thank you, Miss Fein.
Ah!
Oh!
... Ahh ....
Ahhh!
Can't you just say hello like a normal person?
I've been looking forward to this for quite some time.
What's with you?
What, do you like to see young girls suffer?
Oh, yeah.
Especially if they cry.
Okay, Sheffield, I set up five stations for you.
Each of them is worth twenty points.
Start with the ropes.
**********************
Honey, go out there hold your head up high, don't forget to breathe, and above all, watch for your nails.
She stinks.
Well, it's better to have tried and stunk than never to have stunk at all.
Look, she has been working her butt off.
I think that she deserves something for it.
I'm gonna give her something.
An "F."
I love my job ....
What kind of a teacher are you anyway?
Teachers are supposed to educate, not intimidate!
What's the matter, cat got your tongue?
You're choking?
Why didn't you tell me you were choking?
This is the international sign for choking.
Well, now I know.
All right, okay, focus.
Oh, Mrs. Stone, are you okay?
Oh, you saved my life.
You saved my life!
?
Well, I might not have passed gym, but lucky for you,
I passed the Heimlich poster every Sunday at Fun Lums Chinese Restaurant.
So how'd I do?
/ Oh, you did great, honey.
You got an "A." Right?
Right.
Really?
'Cause I felt like I was really on.
... forty-eight.
No matinees.
My understudy's good enough for the blue-haired ladies.
Forty-nine?
I want a personal trainer.
Young, dumb, stacked.
And fifty ..
I want ...
I want this.
Ah, Alan, before you go ...
I have a couple of demands of my own.
Oh, really?
Yeah ....
From now on, I'll give the orders around here, and you will conduct yourself in a professional manner.
Or?
/ Or ... or you're fired.
You're bluffing.
Try me.
C'mon, Sheffield.
You know as well as I know ... that no one can play this role as well as Alan Beck.
I am F.D.R.
December seventh ...
nineteen forty-one.
A date that will live in infamy.
The only thing we have to fear ... is fear itself.
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, Anthony Hopkins called again and he wants to know whether he should bring his own wheelchair.
That guy is such a pest.
/ Oh, man.
Whatever Tony wants is just fine.
/ Ah.
You know, Sheffield, I've been thinking ... maybe some of my demands might be negotiable.
Some of your demands?
All right, all of 'em ... but I'm keeping this.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Miss Babcock has your checks.
You were great.
Thank you.
Very believble.
Anthony Hopkins, Miss Fein?
Nice touch.
My accent was pretty good, huh, Mr. Sheffield?
Maybe I should play Eleanor Roosevelt.
I know all her lines.
"Ah, look at all the lonely people."
That was Eleanor Rigby.
/ Oh.
Don't quit your day job.
/ Oh ...
I won't.
Look at that class of eighty-two.
Hm, hm, hm, what a bunch of losers.
Look at your hair, Fein.
Oh, that was the Farah Fawcett look.
Wait a minute.
Is that Danny Imperiali with his arm around you?
Yeah.
He was my boyfriend.
Oh ....
"A boy like that would kill your brother."
No.
He's not that bad.
Sometimes I still wonder.
"Forget that boy and find another."
Ooh. / "One of your own kind ...
stick to your own kind."
It's that time of year, when I race to the ends of the sky on my bike.
The morning sun that seems to overflow unravels my heart.
Every day I strive to make that dream come true.
I had forgotten the gentleness of the blowing breeze.
The world gets bigger and bigger and I think I can smile brighter and brighter.
If I take a good listen and reach my arms out wide.
Bright shining clouds drift by.
Miku Under Suspicion!
To the 20 million Neo Women's Pro Wrestling fans across the country thank you for your patience.
Now, we finally bring to you the second match of the Universal Championship.
We are here at the Big Tokyo Dome where the hugely popular TWP's Pretty Four will meet the AWP Maskers!
Pretty Nana grabs her by the arm and flings her towards the ropes!
A jump and a spectacular kick!
Wow!
Now from the top rope...
Elbow Drop!
Ginko!
Yo!
The Pretty Four switch off, fast and early.
Next in is the hard fighting Pretty Ginko!
Pretty Ginko's high powered attack!
And finally, the Star of the Beauties, Pretty Miku makes her appearance!
The audience is chanting for the Pretty Four.
Their popularity is unbelievable.
Go, Miku...
Harajuku, the head of the TWP is looking pretty happy.
She does it!
Pretty Miku's drop kick!
Wow!
Dynamite Keiko has panicked and dropped the energy ball.
This is Pretty Miku's chance to finish her off.
What?
But Miku switches off with Sayaka.
Silly!
Pretty Sayaka furiously charges!
Do it, Sayaka!
One, two, three...
A full count!
The Pretty Four win!
I don't like it.
I don't want to see his smiling face again!
If your attack with the Lady Ninjas hadn't failed...
Now listen, Nagoya, listen here...
What, a trainee?
You'll need a stand in if one of you gets hurt.
Besides, she's really passionate about Pro Wrestling.
What do you think?
For a while, we'll have her clean and do the laundry.
My name is Maki Yoshihara, pleased to meet you.
Hey, I think it's great.
She's got a great face and a great body.
Great pop star material.
Can you sing?
Honey!
Eiichi, what do you think?
So, we get another half-assed wrestler.
It doesn't make a difference to me.
Thank you so much!
Thank you everyone!
I'm a huge fan of the Pretty Four!
You're strong, you're cute, and you have great bodies!
I think you're awesome!
I'll do anything, just tell me.
Looking forward to working with you.
Nice to meet you.
Where are you from?
Hokkaido.
Oh, so that's why your skin is so nice.
Being a trainee is a lot of hard work.
Hang in there.
I'm prepared for it.
But thank you so much for sharing your room with me.
Oh, no problem.
I'm so happy that I get to share a room with you Miku.
Why?
Because, you're the best of the Pretty Four.
No, that's not true.
I've got a long way to go.
The fans all think you're the best.
Really?
Yeah.
If there's anything you need, let me know.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
Really?
Thank you.
What's wrong, had enough?
No, I'm fine.
No good, take five and start again.
Right!
Next, Sayaka and Nana.
What are you doing?
Get your butts in the ring.
Yes!
Excuse me, I've finished cleaning over here.
Shall I go do the laundry next?
Please!
Okay!
She's really into it.
She's got guts.
Great kid.
You shouldn't be so relaxed with her.
Perhaps you should think about what it means to you to have a new girl come in.
Maki!
Kinta!
The laundry room...
What's the matter?
Are you okay?
Y-Yeah, I plugged it in and got shocked.
Sorry to cause a commotion.
Are you sure you're okay?
Hey...
What?
It looks like someone cut it with a knife.
I wonder who did it?
It wasn't me.
No one said it was.
Must be a coincidence.
Maybe it just looked like it was cut with a knife.
I hope so.
What are you trying to say?
What Coach was saying...
If Maki becomes a regular, that means one of us would have to step down.
So, are you saying one of us did it to try to get rid of Maki?
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Besides, she's just a trainee.
Maybe we're being paranoid.
O-Ouch, ouch!
Sorry.
There, finished.
You totally exaggerate.
It's just a little burn on your finger.
What do you mean, I could have totally burned my entire body!
But is does seem strange that the water would be so hot.
I got it!
Someone messed with the temperature control on the water heater.
Huh?
What?
Is this someone's idea of a prank?
That's a pretty horrible prank!
Did someone really meddle with it?
All I mean is, that it's possible that someone meddled with it.
So then, it could also mean that it's just broken.
There's no one here who would do such a thing.
Yeah, you're right, but...
Miku's right.
There's no one here who would do such a thing.
Besides, you girls don't need to think about that sort of thing.
You need to concentrate on your next fight.
Right, everyone?
Yes!
Sorry, but I don't have anything to give you for your article...
They're not even close.
Yes, but Mr. Suo, you did take them on.
The way I see it, you're looking to turn that Miku into another Aquamarine.
Nonsense.
But you did take the first step in a new direction.
What's the deal?
I can't move.
Ouch, my back is going to break.
Kinta!
What are you doing?
No good, I can't control it!
Ginko!
Nana!
Help!
Let us go!
This is going to kill us!
What are you doing?
I can't disengage the locks.
Cut the power to the main computer!
Right!
Nana!
Ginko!
Are you okay?
I think I'm going to puke.
I feel like I'm gonna die.
Is anyone hurt?
What happened?
It's my fault!
If I'd only kept the machines up better.
No.
Yesterday's accidents, and now today's incidents someone's behind this.
I agree, someone is trying to mess with us.
W-What?
Well, what else could it be?
Wait a minute, who would do such a thing?
It's not me!
I know I'm the new person here, but I would never do such a thing.
No one is accusing you, Maki.
Yeah, Maki, you're a victim too.
So who here hasn't been attacked?
What, me?
Are you serious?
Where's that going to get you, suspecting one of your own?
Look, there are only you girls here in this gym.
Please get along.
What's so funny?
It is possible that someone here is responsible for this.
With that the new trainee coming in it's not out of the question that one of the four regulars is feeling threatened.
What are you saying?
Mr. Suo, are you trying to make matter worse?
It's not me.
It's not me either.
Me neither.
If it's not you, prove it.
I want to see you all in the gym in ten minutes.
Miku!
Eiichi has an idea, let's leave it up to him.
Coach!
Coach, do you think I did it too?
Do you know what your weakness is?
You're worst quality came out in the last fight.
I'm going to show you what it is right now.
Coach...
My weakness?
All here?
I want everyone in the ring.
Shifty maneuvers are the trademark of someone who lacks confidence.
If you are sure of your skills, you don't need to try to corner someone.
What are we doing?
Battle Royale.
No armor, just you.
See for yourselves where you stand in the TWP.
No ring outs allowed.
The first person to lose is the culprit.
What?
Coach!
This is crazy!
How can you find the culprit like this?
The gong went off.
Look behind you.
I can't do this.
But if you lose now, that makes you the culprit.
You're the one!
Miku, don't take this personally.
Ginko!
Mr. Suo, what are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
Making them fight each other to find the culprit?
Yeah, coach, what are you thinking?
Miku!
Miku, why won't you fight?
Because...
In the last match you had the chance to finish it, but you didn't!
This is your biggest weakness.
The mat is a jungle and everyone is a beast.
Even your friends are the enemy, and only the strong survive.
That is where a true champion is born.
Niceties have no place in the ring.
Got it?
Yes!
Then go!
Yes!
Here I come!
So this wasn't to find the culprit?
What, back already?
Yep, you owe me big.
Just tell me.
No more.
No, I can't allow you to do this.
Just as you thought, that girl is a Shibano Women's Wrestling trainee.
Maki is a Shibano trainee?
What!
You couldn't be...
Well, now that you know.
That's right, I'm Maki from Shibano.
I came to check out your skills.
So it was you who did all that!
You bitch, you're not getting away with this.
Wait, we're still in the ring.
Let me do it.
Let's fight.
I'll take you on Miku.
Miku!
Miku, fight!
You're finished!
Super Miku Kick!
One, two, three...
Yay!
Miku.
That was a good fight, let's do it again sometime in front of a full house.
I think we can call it quits for the day.
Yes!
Father!
How dare you use one of our precious trainees as a spy without even telling me!
First you use the Lady Ninjas to launch an attack now this girl is saying she can't be here anymore.
She left!
Father!
Why are you so obsessed the TWP?
Father, what's the deal with you and Harajuku?
Father!
He used to bully you?
Well, it wasn't like he always beat me up.
They've been going at it since they were kids.
How ridiculous.
And you're still going at it?
It's his fault!
Ten years ago Shibano tried to develop this area.
Father got talked into being the opposition leader then he found out that Shibano was behind the project, he got all scared!
No, that's not true we won that time too.
So that's all the more reason Shibano's pissed off with you.
I-I'm not afraid of him.
Don't worry, we'll definitely beat him when it comes to Pro Wrestling.
Yeah, and together, we can make it to the championship!
I love comics and donuts and your rose colored smile.
Cheer up!
An angel without wings is just an ordinary person.
Plain old hard work is more important than magic.
In a swing hung from the crescent moon there you shall rest.
Brighter than a diamond the sparkle of your eyes is 1,000 carats.
Put your hands in your pockets.
One day, they will come true the dreams that only you can dream.
Miku takes a tumble and hurts her shoulder really bad.
The doctor came and said she can't fight in the next match!
But I'll be rooting for you from the side lines!
Good luck guys!
Next time...
Miku Turns Into a Chicken.
Miku's Elbow Maneuver!
It's that time of year, when I race to the ends of the sky on my bike.
The morning sun that seems to overflow unravels my heart.
Every day I strive to make that dream come true.
I had forgotten the gentleness of the blowing breeze.
The world gets bigger and bigger and I think I can smile brighter and brighter.
If I take a good listen and reach my arms out wide.
Bright shining clouds drift by.
Get out of my way!
If you don't, I'll run you over!
Sorry!
Miku Steps Into the Ring.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to TWP, Tokyo Women's Professional Wrestling.
Today, we'd like to introduce you to the Pretty Four.
Neo-Pro Wrestling proudly presents these super girls to the entertainment world.
The title of their debut song is " Dream Sensation"?
Jeez, that's a tongue twister.
Honey, we've got a problem.
Miku's not here.
Miku?
Yep, she flaked.
Great...
On the day of the record's release...
It's not a record, it's a CD.
Is this lipstick too much?
No, it's perfect!
Too much is your style.
Who the hell cares about your lipstick?
Where is Miku?
No need to get so worked up.
The CD is just a side thing for us.
That's just great.
I busted my butt for you girls and finally got you a record deal.
And you even went out and rented yourself a tux.
And a bowtie...
I'm all for this.
I want to put out a CD.
I love the music business.
You really don't know where Miku is?
Probably at Neo Budohkan.
Here she comes, Aquamarine!
Last month, after a two year hiatus, she finally returned to the Neo Woman's Wrestling World and wrestled the JWMF champion belt from Sapphire...
Queen Aquamarine!
What sort of battle does she have in store for us today?
I made it!
In the red corner...
Mad Kong!
The evil flower that blossoms in the ring.
Known for her dirty tactics...
The personification of evil itself.
And here she is, Aquamarine!
For the first time in two years...
Her activities in the United States are shrouded in mystery but whatever it was, her skills and popularity haven't suffered.
She truly is the goddess of mystery, a superhero!
She's so awesome!
And now, it's time for the match to begin.
Go, Aquamarine!
That's it!
The Killer Antoinette, it always gets the job done.
Just like the guillotine blade that ended the life of Marie Antoinette Aquamarine's killer move.
An impressive victory in the very first round of the challenge for the championship title.
She's done it, Aquamarine!
You idiot!
You idiot!
I'm sorry.
Look, Miku.
You haven't even made your debut yet.
We were trying to create some hype with the debut event...
But I'd much rather be strong than be a singer.
And you think you can become strong watching Aqua-Pudding fight?
It's Aquamarine, hon.
I wish I could have gone.
Me too.
There's nothing like the rush of seeing a good fight.
And you girls!
I am acting in lieu of your parents.
I won't allow this sort of behavior anymore!
Yes, Sir.
Masayo, you deal with this.
But, my helmet...
The record company, the hotel costs....
Oh, my head aches!
As your punishment, you will clean the gym for the next week.
No mops, you can scrub the floor by hand.
That'll build up your legs and back.
But...
It's only fair.
You did go off on your own to see Aquamarine's fight.
Clean, clean!
So is this Aquamarine a problem?
It's not so much that she's a problem but I'd like to see Sapphire take the championship belt back.
I don't understand why someone like you is so interested in professional wrestling.
You, my daughter, the heiress to Shibano Consulting it's not exactly appropriate.
Neo Pro Wrestling is only a small part of the show business industry.
It does make a profit.
It's popularity is growing, and I think it's a business that is about to sky rocket.
A lot of organizations are predicting success and are jumping on the band wagon.
For example, the up and coming TWP who are gaining recognition with their pop star singer-wrestlers.
What?
Pop star singer-wrestlers, eh...
Yes, a former factory foreman named Harajuku...
He set out to start a talent agency but his wife is a former wrestler and before they knew it, they were the Neo Pro Wrestling Teams.
Harajuku?
Could it be Tokichiro Harajuku?
What?
Father, you know him?
Tokichiro Harajuku.
What's the matter?
The rival teams must be eliminated.
Your Shibano Women's World Pro Wrestling team must be number one in the Neo Pro-Wrestling world.
We can't have anything taint the world wide reputation of Shibano Consulting.
I don't care how you do it.
You must wipe out our rivals.
Father...
Yoko.
This isn't a project for you as my daughter It will be a test of your business skills.
Finally finished.
Good work!
Kinta...
I heard you went to see Aquamarine's fight.
How was it?
It was awesome!
With that sure-fire Killer Antoinette move...
In no time...
You can, Miku!
Really?
Sure!
Hey, I finished your metal suits for the debut match.
This is so cool!
You like it?
Thank you Kinta!
Hey, ow!
Listen up, girls.
What is it, Mom?
I've got the rotation for the match.
First up is Sayaka.
Then Nana.
Miku, second in command.
Ginko's the captain.
What?
Just like that, I'm second in command?
It's your debut match.
You want to be visible.
That's right.
We're giving you the big push, Miku.
I hope I'll be all right.
Don't worry, Miku, we'll make you look good.
Just don't fumble when we pass you the energy ball.
It's a major drag if you do.
You're one to talk.
You fumbled and had a panic attack in your debut match.
Hey, why do you have to go there?
That's it, play nice.
You girls be careful, don't get hurt.
Boss, someone's here to see you.
You're Mr. Harajuku, the representative?
I'm Yoko Shibano, I represent the Shibano Women's World Wrestling Team.
S-Shibano?
Are you Kozo Shibano's daughter?
Yes.
I've come here today to give you this, as a representative of the Neo Pro Wrestling Commission.
Is something the matter?
Get a hold of yourself, dear.
I'm sorry, he just gets a little nervous around pretty girls.
Let me see here...
An announcement for the JWMF championship...
JWMF Champion?
It's a championship tournament open to all leagues to determine the champion of the Neo Pro-Wrestling World.
The champion...
Isn't that Aquamarine?
It's a tournament to qualify for the match to fight for the champion belt that Aquamarine holds.
You will participate, won't you?
This is a bit of a surprise...
What do you think, hon?
I-I am totally against it!
The girls are already the champions of TWP.
They don't need to fight any other leagues.
Champions?
But the TWP is just one team.
All you do is hire wrestlers from abroad and from other teams ...to have matches.
If you don't participate, it will only reflect badly on you.
No, those girls have plenty of fans.
They don't need to be a part of this sort of tournament.
Are you sure it isn't because you don't think they can win?
Think what you like.
But we will have nothing to do with a "universal championship".
Please leave now.
You didn't have to turn her down so rudely.
No, that was perfectly fine.
Really, don't you think you should discuss it with them?
No, it isn't necessary.
Especially for Miku, she's about to have her first match.
So that's Miku, the new girl.
They already love her.
I wonder if she's any good.
Sayaka!
Ginko!
Nana!
The Star of the Beauties, Miku!
Together, we're the Pretty Four!
Here goes!
Sayaka!
I had my guard down.
Sayaka!
Nana's up, I'm next.
What is that?
It's a weakness detector.
That's Nana's trademark.
All right!
Good one!
Nana!
Oh no, she's not gonna make it!
I'm next.
I've got to go for it!
Nana, watch out!
You idiot, what are you doing?
But it's my turn.
Sorry Miku.
I'll just beat the crap out of her, then you can go.
What the hell are you lookin' at?
Ginko, give it to me.
No, I'm fine.
Ginko, switch off!
All right!
Finally, the new girl.
Keep shooting.
Yeah, yeah.
Princess Rosemary Crush!
Oh no, her new metal suit!
Her metal suit's broken.
Yeah...
Who the hell are you?
What the...
That's enough!
Moonlight Jewels!
So, the TWP is just playing "wrestling" after all.
Now I know why you're running from the championship.
What do you mean, running from the championship?
Who the hell are you, barging in our match?
You won't get away with this!
You bastards...
Boss!
Get them, kick their butts!
Pitiful...
So, what's it going to be, girls?
We'll fight you.
All right!
I'll get you for ruining my debut match.
Don't you forget it!
I love comics and donuts and your rose colored smile.
Cheer up!
An angel without wings is just an ordinary person.
Plain old hard work is more important than magic.
In a swing hung from the crescent moon there you shall rest.
Brighter than a diamond the sparkle of your eyes is 1,000 carats.
Put your hands in your pockets.
One day, they will come true the dreams that only you can dream.
Who is this drunk?
What, he's our new coach?
At about the same time we found out who we'd be fighting in round one of the universal championship.
The demolition crew from hell, the Crushers.
Can we beat a group of monsters like them?
Next time...
Miku Practices Hard!
Miku's Special Kick!
It's that time of year, when I race to the ends of the sky on my bike.
The morning sun that seems to overflow unravels my heart.
Every day I strive to make that dream come true.
I had forgotten the gentleness of the blowing breeze.
The world gets bigger and bigger and I think I can smile brighter and brighter.
If I take a good listen and reach my arms out wide.
Bright shining clouds drift by.
Here comes Sapphire!
The Jewels against the Shuffles.
Here comes the climax!
Miku's Special Training.
What a dangerous feat.
Sapphire, by brute force took The Shuffle's Diamond out.
What the...
She's not human...
What?
Just like is says here, they made it though their first round with flying colors.
What's the problem?
What are you doing?
And it was such a nice picture of the four of them.
You think that little game they were playing was Neo Pro Wrestling?
A game?
We're back!
What gives you the right to say that...
You didn't even watch the match till the end...
I couldn't stand to watch it.
What's wrong?
These suits aren't so bad.
They're well taken care of.
Of course, they're for the matches.
Shame, they're wasted on these girls.
What the hell is this drunk talking about?
These suits are crying because you don't even know how to make the best of them.
Make the best of them?
What does that mean?
You don't get it?
Take a minute to think about it.
Why are you wearing the metal suits in the first place?
Your moves, a circus monkey could do better...
What?
All you do is jump around to put on a show.
You have these great metal suits but you don't even make good use of them.
Same with your moves.
You don't know how to use the power of the suits.
Hey, we've done our research!
What the hell does a washed up coach like you know, anyway?
The way you are now, it's pointless to teach you anything.
So, you're saying that we've got no talent.
All right, then let me ask you why do you wear the metal suits?
That's obvious.
...for power and speed.
Also, to record hit points during the fight.
You saying that's wrong?
That's wrong.
Then what are they for?
The metal suits are to look cool.
To look cool, he says.
How stupid.
Are you serious?
Really, I was wondering what you had to say.
Coach, I was taking you seriously.
Please stop messing with us.
I'm serious.
What the hell do you think Neo Pro Wrestling is?
A fighting art.
Real fighting is what you do with your bare bodies.
You prove your body and your strength.
That's what fighting is.
So what other reason would there be for these metal suits other than to look cool?
Yeah, but the power is increased, and the fights are much more hard core.
That's why it looks cool.
...so it's more hard core and faster and the moves are much more involved.
Adding the flashy metal suits to the grand spectacle of fighting that's what Neo Pro Wrestling is.
You guys can't even use the metal suits properly that kind of wrestling is unsightly.
Our wrestling is unsightly?
Are you saying we're ugly?
How dare you...
Use the suits properly how do we do that?
You want me to teach you?
H-Hey, wait a minute, Miku...
A-Are you okay?
No, I'm not okay.
I have no control of my hands and legs.
Hey, Kinta, why the hell do you make stuff like this?
But...
Leave them on, even when you're sleeping.
What?
You've got to be kidding.
I can't stand up anymore.
Is wearing these really going to help us make better use of the suits?
Your weakness is your balance.
Your balance is off, that's why you can't exploit the true power of the suits.
If you can learn to function normally with those on you'll be more balanced in your suits.
What are those?
Muscle gear, to help the ladies' posture.
And just how long do we have to live in these?
Till your next match.
What, that's a week from now!
Mom, tell him!
We can't go anywhere looking like this!
I've left Eiichiro in charge of you.
If he says so, that's what you need to do.
But...
One hundred...
One hundred one...
One, two, three...
Hey, Nana!
Nana, get away!
Are you trying to kill me?
Sorry.
I've had it!
What's that?
They look stupid!
They're laughing at us.
Damn!
Hey, I did it!
I didn't fall!
Good!
Good!
I think we're getting used to these.
Yeah.
Big news!
Big news!
What, what's the big news?
Coach Suo is quitting.
What?
Are you sure?
I overheard him talking to the bosses.
He doesn't have it in him to coach anymore.
What?
Woo hoo!
Yeah!
He's finally leaving!
I'm so happy!
Father, the championship is a huge success.
Neo Pro Wrestling is getting world wide attention.
Now all we need to do is make sure that Sapphire defeats Aquamarine and Shibata Consulting will control Neo Pro-Wrestling.
I heard TWP won the first round.
That was sheer luck.
You mustn't slack off.
You must destroy them.
We don't need to get so worked up over such a small league.
That is why I think you are naive.
You mustn't let up until the TWP has taken its last breath.
Do you understand me?
Y-Yes.
Getting it from Father again?
Brother...
You look exhausted.
What's wrong?
Why is father so hung up on TWP?
The man in charge there is Harajuku, right?
Yes.
I guess you don't know.
What?
You'll find out soon enough.
Are you really quitting?
I never wanted to take this job in the first place.
And now that I'm doing it, it's bringing back all sorts of bad memories.
It's Miku, isn't it?
She's an awful lot like Aquamarine when she was young.
I nailed it, didn't I?
That's not it.
They don't have any potential, that's why...
You don't have to hide it.
It's written all over your face.
You're still hung up on her, after all this time.
What?
If you're a real man, why don't you just deal with it, without the booze.
I've lost respect for you.
I have no intention of leaving my precious girls in the hands of a spineless man like you!
What do you mean, they have no potential?
When did you go blind?
They're rough around the edges right now but they can be polished into diamonds.
Even you should be able to see that.
I'll do it my way, is that okay?
Have you heard me complain so far?
I've sort of lost my edge, now that drunk is gone.
True, he was a jerk of a coach, but now that he's gone...
I kind of miss him.
Who needs him, I feel great!
Yeah, that's right.
Miku?
I've finally gotten used to them, it's kind of a waste to stop now.
I want to be able to take advantage of my metal suit.
I want to be a cool Pro Wrestler.
Weekly Neo Ring, editorial department.
W-W-What?
A sneak attack, is this for real?
Yeah, I got an anonymous tip.
Shibano's Lady Ninjas are going to give a special performance, outside the ring.
What a scoop!
991, 992... 993, 994...
Come on, you're almost done!
Damn, if only we didn't have the gear on, 1,000 would be a breeze.
999, 1,000
Finished.
That was hard.
Your balance is so much better.
I guess that drunk's crazy ideas do work.
What the?
What's the matter, Ginko?
Who the hell are you!
We're the protectors of justice.
We're gonna make sure that you don't set foot in the sacred ring ever again.
What!
What's going on?
Coach, the Lady Ninjas...
Take off the muscle gear!
Kinta!
I know!
Sayaka!
Ginko!
Nana!
And the Star of the Beauties, Pretty Miku!
Together we are the Pretty Four!
I feel so light!
It's so easy to move around!
I feel stronger.
Not bad.
Now we fight for real.
Sayaka!
This is a great story!
Don't lose them!
Right!
Watch out!
Ginko!
Just how low are you?
Miku's Kick!
Got it!
Yes!
Justice will eventually prevail!
Miku, you did it!
Think I overdid it?
Hey, are you all right?
Wow, after all that, I'm not even sweating.
Hey, you're right.
I wonder if we look any cooler.
Coach, it was all because of the muscle gear.
Thank you!
So, think they're stones worth polishing?
Say cheese!
I love comics and donuts and your rose colored smile.
Cheer up!
An angel without wings is just an ordinary person.
Plain old hard work is more important than magic.
In a swing hung from the crescent moon there you shall rest.
Brighter than a diamond the sparkle of your eyes is 1,000 carats.
Put your hands in your pockets.
One day, they will come true the dreams that only you can dream.
We got trouble!
What's up, Miku?
There's this young girl who wants to join the TWP.
Will Maki become one of the Beauties?
Maki, let's work hard!
But...
Next time...
Miku Under Suspicion.
Miku's Head Butt!
It's that time of year, when I race to the ends of the sky on my bike.
The morning sun that seems to overflow unravels my heart.
Every day I strive to make that dream come true.
I had forgotten the gentleness of the blowing breeze.
The world gets bigger and bigger and I think I can smile brighter and brighter.
If I take a good listen and reach my arms out wide.
Bright shining clouds drift by.
I see the TWP is winning.
Yes, it appears to be so.
How can you be so laid back about it?
If you had succeeded in your task this wouldn't have happened.
What is the matter with you?
The Lady Ninjas' surprise attack was a failure we sent a spy in but she got caught it's just one disaster after another that's what you want to say, right?
If you already know then why don't you get off your ass and come up with another plan.
I already have one.
I have a plan to drag down the Pretty Four and their indispensable teamwork.
And what would that be?
You'll see.
Nagoya, I've entrusted you with this job because I have confidence in your abilities, especially after seeing your handiwork with our corporate takeovers.
Don't fail me again.
I have a job to do.
Don't worry pops, I'll smear that Harajuku for you.
Miku Falls Head Over Heels.
I'm so bored!
Bored!
I can't wait to get back in the ring!
Well, you look all better.
Uh, I think you must have the wrong room.
No, Miss Ginko, I've come to see you.
Me?
Hey there.
Kinta.
Who was that?
I have no idea.
I think he got the wrong room.
Ginko looks much better, we have no practice let's just take it easy for a change.
Yeah.
Well?
I'm starving!
Nana, you're making a fool of yourself.
Let's treat ourselves to a really nice lunch today!
Yeah!
Food!
Food!
Oh yeah?
Let's hear you say that again!
I said, you're the ones who hit me!
No, you hit us.
My shoulder is very sensitive.
I think you need to pay us for damages.
Blackmail?
That's a lttle dated.
What?
Why don't we take this somewhere quieter?
Yay!
Miku.
Yay!
Yeah!
Damn!
Hey, wait!
No, that's enough.
But...
No, really, it's fine thanks to you...
Thank you.
No, I just...
I don't know how to repay you...
I'd like to take you to lunch as a thank you.
But...
Food!
Food!
Good, let's go then.
What about Sayaka and Nana?
I'm gonna borrow her for a bit, okay?
That will be all.
Enjoy your meal.
A Pro Wrestler...
No wonder you're so strong.
Uh, I'm usually very quiet, but back there, I...
You're cute.
I confess, from the first moment I saw you, I knew you were...
The star of beauty that I'd been searching for.
Is that a little forward of me?
I, uh...
I've never been out to lunch with a man like this before.
All I've ever thought about was becoming strong.
Look around you.
Look at all the girls your age, out enjoying their youth.
Why don't you have some fun too?
It's not natural to live only for Pro Wrestling.
Not natural?
Yeah, you need to enjoy your youth more.
Here we are.
Umm...
I had a lot of fun today.
Thank you very much.
See you.
Can I see you again?
Have some fun...
Stop thinking about wrestling for a bit.
What's the matter, Miku?
Oh, nothing.
We saved dinner for you.
I'm fine.
I'm going to bed.
Goodnight.
Miku's a little high from her first date.
D-Date?
Yep, and he's really nice and handsome.
I wonder why he didn't ask me out?
Miku went out with someone like that?
You can't tell Coach about this.
Love must be gently nurtured.
Got it?
Look at all the girls your age, out enjoying their youth.
It's not natural to live only for Pro Wrestling.
I'm not unnatural, am I?
You idiot.
What's the matter with you?
I'm sorry.
Your jumps and your kicks are totally limp.
How do you expect to beat anyone like that?
Do it again!
Yes!
To live only for Pro Wrestling...
This is pointless.
What's the matter?
You're not your usual self.
This isn't dance practice.
We're starting over with the basics.
Why us too?
Don't talk back.
1,000 jump ropes.
Now, 2,000 squats.
Now, go run 30 kilometers.
Sayaka, are we unnatural?
What do you mean?
Most girls don't wrestle.
Of course not.
But...
Don't talk to me, I'm out of breath.
Miku, you're not yourself today.
Ginko!
Welcome home.
Hey!
Discharged and all better.
Congratulations.
Hey, quit slacking off.
If you're done running, sparing's next.
Yes, Coach.
Coach, I want to train too.
No, not you.
But look, I'm all better!
Miku, so I hear you had a date with a man.
What's he like?
C'mon tell me.
What, why so shy?
Sayaka, you guys know something, c'mon, tell me.
Sorry Ginko, today's training was really hard, and we don't have any strength left to talk.
I'm going to bed.
I think I'm gonna puke.
I'm done.
Are you serious, Eiichiro?
Yes, we'll use a formation without Ginko for the next match.
But the doctor said she's fine.
All she has to do is build her strength back up.
We have the semi-finals next...
We can't win against these opponents with a half-assed plan.
She doesn't have time to get her strength back before the next match!
They're all...
Damn.
Oh, let me introduce myself.
This is my card.
United Battle Agency, Chief Manager...
Kazuma Nikaido.
I'm a women's wrestling promoter in the US.
We're getting ready to start a new league in the States.
We'd like you to be one of the start up members when we debut.
What, in America?
But I...
We know that you are the powerhouse of the Pretty Four...
But in the US, it's common for skilled and popular athletes to go where the deal is sweeter.
But why me?
I've seen all of your fights.
Even our Los Angeles office is impressed with your talent.
We can offer you a better rank, and more money too.
Wait a minute, I can't just make a snap decision here.
I have to talk to my teammates and my bosses.
Think about it.
You're a star.
Are you being treated like a star?
The way I see it, you're not given the treatment you deserve.
But I...
This is about your future.
Yes, I see.
At a later date, then.
Fell right in to my trap...
The Universal Championship match between the Moonlight Jewels and the Amazons is about to begin.
Miku and Ginko didn't come after all.
Miku doesn't have much energy these days.
Maybe it's not going so well with that wonderful man.
But I wonder why Ginko didn't come.
Put on your metal suits!
Here they are, the Death Gods of the Jungle, the Amazon Wrestlers.
Moonlight Jewels!
Make sure you get lots of shots.
Sapphire might show us some of her new moves today.
Yes Sir!
Ruby...
We're almost finished.
Switch with me.
Miku.
I'm going to send you to hell.
What?
You want me to quit wrestling?
Yes, I don't think it suits you.
But...
You ought to have more romantic dreams.
America...
I love comics and donuts and your rose colored smile.
Cheer up!
An angel without wings is just an ordinary person.
Plain old hard work is more important than magic.
In a swing hung from the crescent moon there you shall rest.
Brighter than a diamond the sparkle of your eyes is 1,000 carats.
Put your hands in your pockets.
One day, they will come true the dreams that only you can dream.
Not beaten down by the rain...
Not beaten down by Sapphire...
If a wrestler is in trouble in the East...
Go to the rescue!
If faced with the Star Wolves in the West kick their sorry butts!
Undisturbed by Shibano's sabotage that's the kind of wrestler I want to be!
Next time...
Miku Confesses.
Miku's Crash of Sorrow!
It's that time of year, when I race to the ends of the sky on my bike.
The morning sun that seems to overflow unravels my heart.
Every day I strive to make that dream come true.
I had forgotten the gentleness of the blowing breeze.
The world gets bigger and bigger and I think I can smile brighter and brighter.
If I take a good listen and reach my arms out wide.
Bright shining clouds drift by.
I'm out!
I've been last out four times in a row.
No one loses against Miku.
Girls, I think you got it all wrong.
We've got a big match ahead of us, this attitude is not appropriate.
Oh, leave them alone.
I'm just worried that they're being too laid back and they'll get hurt because of it.
Don't you agree, Mr. Suo?
Miku turns into a Chicken.
Thanks.
Sorry we're in such a rush.
It's no problem.
I love to drive.
Sorry Kinta.
It's okay...
I love to drive, and I love you too, Miku.
W-What?
I'm so happy!
Let me give you a kiss!
That's perfect!
Hey, I never said anything like that!
Okay, then why'd you turn so red?
Cut it out, leave her alone.
Kinta, watch the road!
I saw him last night polishing up Miku's suit real nice.
Hey Kinta, playing favorites, are you?
I'm not!
You don't need to get so defensive, Kinta!
Hey, look out, in front of you!
Miku...
Is she hurt?
Kinta, call an ambulance!
O-Okay.
I'm fine.
Are you hurt, Miku?
No, I just lost my balance.
This is where we're staying?
It's not a resort?
This sucks.
Oh, hello, hello.
Thank you for coming all this way.
God, this place is horrible.
This is so totally...
What can I say?
Wow, this is really well made.
Would you like to have a bath first?
In the canyon below, we have a hot spring that is the pride of this inn.
What do you want to do?
Yeah, a dunk in the hot spring would be great.
Yay, hot spring!
Let's go!
Miku, aren't you going to go to the hot spring?
I think I'll go later.
Okay, we'll see you later then.
Hey, wait for me!
Oh no!
Oh man, it was great!
As usual, Sayaka was in the bath forever we got out first then this group of old men came in, and...
She couldn't get out!
Stop it!
How embarrassing.
You should have just gotten out!
After all, as you're always saying, you do have a hell of a body.
No way, if I'm going to show it to someone, I'd like to have a say in who it is!
So, what kind of man would that be?
Well, of course, someone who is young, good looking, rich...
Hey, look what you made me say!
It looks like you injured the shoulder joint.
I can't say for sure, without the proper tests, but I would have to say...
She must have received some shock to the shoulder from a heavy impact.
It must have been when she fell over in the bus.
Well, no physical exercise for a while.
What about our match, it's in two days?
Pro Wrestling is out of the question.
You've got to let it rest.
Take care.
Take care.
Miku, I'm sorry!
I was careless.
No, it's my fault!
Well, what's done is done.
We've got to figure out what to do about the match.
If we don't have four members, we disqualify.
I'll fight, please let me fight.
Miku, I understand how you feel, but...
No, it's fine.
It's just my right shoulder, I can still fight.
Please, let me fight.
You may not be able to fight, but you can at least stand in our corner and watch.
We'll just have to make do with the three others.
But will you be okay with just three girls?
That just depends on them.
Look, we're one man short.
Quit messing around!
Hey, nice facilities!
The idols in the chicken coop...
This'll make a great picture.
What are you doing here?
No need to be so cold.
We have the boss' okay.
Hey, you're one man short.
Don't bother me right now.
We'll talk later.
I wonder if you'll be okay...
Your next opponents, the Beauties of Nature, have a secret weapon.
What do you mean?
You did say secret weapon, didn't you?
We were just at the hotel where the Shibano Women are staying we went there to check out this rumor but the guard wouldn't let us in.
They have skill, but there's an awful lot of mystery about them.
Fine, then you can't be here either.
Hey, wait a minute!
There's no way I could stay still.
I'd get all stiff and slow.
Ow.
Come back here!
Jingoro, go back to your coop!
Stop running away!
Stay there!
Let me help too!
Got away again!
That's it, that's a good boy.
Just let me catch you.
Got it!
Ouch, my head!
Are you okay?
It's always like this.
Just when I think I have him and let my guard down, he attacks me.
He's such a trouble maker.
Not bad.
To be expected of the number two at Shibano Women's Pro Wrestling.
This isn't the half of it.
Damn, I've been seen.
Ah, this is heavenly.
I wonder what's for dinner tonight?
I hear it's a full course rainbow trout meal.
Yes!
Rainbow trout!
Yeah, let's eat lots of fish and fight for Miku too!
Kinta!
There, all done.
T-Thank you.
Why were you spying, Kinta?
Yeah, how dare you see me naked!
That's not what I'm talking about!
Why would you spy on them?
Because, Miku got hurt because of me, so I thought if there was something I could do to help.
You don't have to do that.
We'll win because we're good.
Yeah, I can beat them all by myself.
Kinta, we'll get them back for you.
Yeah, we've soaked in the hot spring, our skin is smooth, our faces are bright...
There's no way we're gonna lose.
Come on, eat...
Let's have a great fight tomorrow.
Here we are at a new venue, the Tohoku Big Coliseum where round three of the All Japan Neo Women's Pro Wrestling Universal Championship is about to begin.
And here we have both teams entering the arena.
Put your metal suits on!
Sayaka!
Ginko!
Nana!
And the Star of the Beauties, Miku!
Together, we are the Pretty Four!
Hanako!
Toriko!
Kazeko!
Tsukiko!
Beauties of Nature!
Nana, be careful!
Got it!
All right!
The Beauties of Nature's Toriko is already switching off with Kazeko.
The Pretty Four are at ease.
There's nothing to worry about.
Kinta had us all worried.
Nana, go on, take another one out.
Hallelujah Hurricane!
Nana, why do you bother with a move that wipes you out?
Nana, switch!
No problem.
I'll finish this off.
Miku, you won't have to fight.
We can do this!
Good luck Ginko!
Let me see now, what shall I do?
You fools, this has all been an act to draw the audience in.
The real fight begins here.
What?
We know about your secret weapon, so why don't you hurry up and bring it on out?
And another one!
Ginko!
Ginko!
Nana.
Got it!
We've got trouble!
Pretty Nana and Pretty Sayaka have been immobilized!
Warning!
Warning!
Cut it out, what are you doing to my girls?
Coach!
Ginko.
No Miku, don't do it.
They're really strong.
Ginko!
Oh, what's the matter little girl, are you hurt?
Observe, just how powerful we are.
Ginko!
No!
Ginko!
Go ahead, why don't you let her tag you?
Here, come on!
No, Miku!
Shut up!
Ginko!
Are you nuts?
Picking up the energy ball with an injured shoulder?
Miku...
No more playing games.
Miku Chicken Typhoon!
One, two, three...
Pretty Miku, I underestimated you.
Ginko!
Miku...
Ginko!
You did good.
We won!
We won!
I love comics and donuts and your rose colored smile.
Cheer up!
An angel without wings is just an ordinary person.
Plain old hard work is more important than magic.
In a swing hung from the crescent moon there you shall rest.
Brighter than a diamond the sparkle of your eyes is 1,000 carats.
Put your hands in your pockets.
One day, they will come true the dreams that only you can dream.
From the first time they met...
A love blossomed.
Star of the Beauties, Pretty Miku, and Nagoya Shibano's seaside date.
Nagoya...
Oh, Nagoya, Nagoya!
Get away, don't touch!
Get off the road to love!
Next episode...
Miku Falls Head Over Heels.
Miku's Terror Jump!
It's that time of year, when I race to the ends of the sky on my bike.
The morning sun that seems to overflow unravels my heart.
Every day I strive to make that dream come true.
I had forgotten the gentleness of the blowing breeze.
The world gets bigger and bigger and I think I can smile brighter and brighter.
If I take a good listen and reach my arms out wide.
Bright shining clouds drift by.
Miku Practices Hard!
We're here at the preliminary rounds for the championship for the All Japan Women's Neo Wrestling World.
No sooner than the seven leagues and free agents did the wrestlers begin this free for all.
I'm so glad I didn't bring the girls down.
Ms. Shibata if your Sapphire wins, it will mean a title rematch with Aquamarine.
Would you like to comment?
Sapphire does retain the right to challenge her to a rematch.
But the reason we chose to have an open tournament is to prove to the world that she is the true champion.
The next time they meet, I guarantee that Sapphire will win.
Hey Aquamarine, you and that belt belong to us, the Crushers.
How rude.
Come, let's go, Aquamarine.
Hey, are you running from the Crushers?
You!
Stop it.
What do you think this championship is for?
If you're true fighters, you'll settle this in the ring.
Aquamarine, the truth will come out in that ring.
You just wait!
What if my girls get hurt fighting against monsters like that?
I think I blew it.
Hey Boss!
How was registration?
A-Are you really going to go through with this?
Of course.
And we intend to win too.
Isn't that right, guys?
Well, yeah.
But this is different than the other fights.
These people are the top of their leagues.
You've really got to be ready for this.
Dear!
Are you still himming and hawing?
These girls have already made their minds up to do this!
I-I understand, Mother.
So, whose our first fight against?
The CWP Crushers.
What?
That team of gorillas?
Not bad for our first fight.
Oh, so it's not the Moonlight Jewels?
So, Sapphire gets off again.
We can take the Crushers, no problem.
Still, don't slack off.
I've drilled the basics in to you girls, but you're actual fighting experience is limited.
So, I've brought in a new coach.
What, a new coach?
A new coach, what's he like?
Is he handsome?
Is he tough?
Is he strong?
Hey, what are you doing?
What's the matter, Kinta?
What's the matter?
This guy came in out of nowhere and just passed out.
W-Who is this drunk?
Where's Masayo?
Masayo?
How is it that you know her well enough to use her first name?
It's okay, Kinta.
There you are, and here I am.
I'm all yours.
We've been waiting for you, Eiichi.
Let me introduce you to Eiichi Suo, your new coach.
No way!
This jerk?
Jerk, what do you mean?
N-Nothing.
Got a problem?
You stink like booze.
What a nasty smell.
Yuck!
Well, you girls smell like piss.
What did you say?
You want to be stronger, don't you?
Of course, I want to be strong like Aquamarine.
What's so funny?
Those are awfully big dreams to be dreaming so early in the day.
Why you!
Cut it out Ginko.
Just ignore him.
I'll give him a good one, maybe that'll sober him up.
Ouch!
Don't you even know how to fall?
How dare you do that to Ginko!
Nana!
S-Stop it, please.
Don't worry.
You can't even fall properly, but you whine about wanting to be strong!
If you want to get better, let's see you take 2,000 falls!
2,000 falls?
Can't do it?
Little late for that, isn't it?
Late, why?
The fall is the foundation of wrestling.
Where do you get off thinking you can step into the ring, when you can't even fall?
Can't do it?
Then pack it in, ladies!
We can do it!
But this doesn't mean we've accepted you as our coach.
Who says I've decided to be your coach?
If you can't prove that you have guts or skill, I'll quit.
You underestimate us!
What's 2,000 falls?
Hold it!
Who said to do it dressed like that?
Put on your training gear!
Kid!
You keep track.
Who are you calling kid?
My name is Kinta Marukome.
Kinta.
Okay.
Ready.
Okay, begin.
Ouch!
I'm not giving in.
Shock impact 75%.
Damage 15 HP, energy, negative 20...
E-Exactly.
Shock impact 30, Damage 0.
That's what I want you to go for.
And you?
Are you quitting?
This is why I hate old farts.
Why us?
No bitching!
One thousand, nine hundred ninety eight.
One thousand nine hundred ninety nine.
Last one...
Go!
Two thousand.
Finished...
I can't move.
My butt!
Are you okay?
How could we be okay?
I bet my butt's all black and blue.
Hey old man, wake up.
They did it, 2,000 times.
Finally finished?
Here, here's the data for all 2,000 falls.
Where the hell are you going?
He didn't even look at the data and he's already going out to get more booze!
You've got to be kidding.
What the hell is Ma thinking, bringing in a jerk...
What!
He's Aqua Pudding's old coach?
If you don't even know who Aquamarine is, why are you surprised?
That was before she went off to America.
Eiichi will get them in shape.
What?
Are you serious?
Yeah, I heard them talking.
I can't believe it...
A drunk like him?
Aquamarine's...
Oh my god, Aquamarine's coach!
It's a dream!
My back!
O-O-Ouch!
Let go of me, you drunk.
Pitiful.
Well, I do have to say you have guts attacking me after what happened to you yesterday.
Damn.
If you've got that much energy, let's see you do 3,000 squats!
No way, we'll die!
Coach, we only have 10 days till the championship begins.
Please teach us some new moves.
New moves?
I want to be strong like Aquamarine.
That's some mouth you got.
Not bad, not bad at all.
If you want to be strong, let's see you do 3,000 squats.
Then you can continue your babbling!
Get going.
One thousand fifteen.
One thousand sixteen.
One thousand seventeen.
One thousand eighteen.
One thousand nineteen.
One thousand twenty.
One thousand twenty one.
One thousand twenty two.
One thousand twenty three.
One thousand twenty four.
One thousand twenty five.
One thousand twenty...
Who said you could take a break?
If you can't hack it, you got no business trying to be a wrestler.
You wanna get wet too?
One thousand twenty six.
One thousand twenty seven.
One thousand twenty eight.
One thousand twenty nine.
One thousand thirty, thirty one, thirty two, thirty three...
One more week.
The tournament roster has been officially announced.
I wonder if Sapphire will win and move on to fight for the belt?
Who knows what dark horse will come riding in.
Is that your hunch?
I just think that would make it interesting.
What's the matter?
You're shaking.
Two thousand one...
Two thousand two...
Two thousand three...
Two thousand four...
Two thousand five...
Two thousand, nine hundred, ninety seven...
Two thousand, nine hundred, ninety eight..
Two thousand, nine hundred, ninety nine...
Three thousand!
You can finally do 3,000 squats without collapsing.
That's it for today, go take a shower.
And, no practice tomorrow.
Get some rest.
And finally, the big day is here.
And the tumultuous weather outside couldn't be more appropriate.
Howling winds.
Driving Rain.
Here we are at the Big Tokyo Dome in the midst of an off-season typhoon to bring you the opening of the first round of the All Japan Neo Women's Pro Wrestling Universal Championship.
Damn him!
That Eiichiro, one of these days I'm going to get him!
You're still going on about that?
Wow, I feel really light.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah!
All right, I'm gonna pretend it's Eiichiro, and kick the Crushers' ass!
Let's do it!
Here come the team members!
Put on your metal suits!
Sayaka!
Ginko!
Nana!
And the star of the Beauties, Pretty Miku!
Together we are the Pretty Four!
Dump!
Roller!
Crane!
Bull!
Crushers!
Ginko!
Run!
Run if you can!
One...
Two...
Thr--
You gorilla woman!
Ginko!
Swan Screw!
Now's our chance!
Go Miku!
What?
That's allowed?
Wow!
Roller's big move!
A Frankenstiener from the top rope!
Pretty Miku is immobilized.
Miku!
It's the Jumping Needle Attack!
I know how to fall.
Now it's my turn!
One...
Two...
Three...
We won!
Yay!
Not bad.
Quite an improvement from since her debut match.
Eiichiro...
That explains it...
Caution!
Caution!
That is against the rules!
Shut up!
Let us go!
The winners of round one of the Neo Women's Pro-Wrestling Championship is Pretty Four!
I'm too old for this.
I love comics and donuts and your rose colored smile.
Cheer up!
An angel without wings is just an ordinary person.
Plain old hard work is more important than magic.
In a swing hung from the crescent moon there you shall rest.
Brighter than a diamond the sparkle of your eyes is 1,000 carats.
Put your hands in your pockets.
One day, they will come true the dreams that only you can dream.
No matter how hard or bad it looks we always do fine in the ring.
Hold it, hold it!
This isn't good, who are you guys?
What do you want from us?
The Lady Ninjas?
Next time...
Miku's Special Training.
Miku's Shockwave Punch!
You know, George, you'd think a man of your stature would be able to find some underling to help you with this brainless grunt work.
There you are, Mr. Turner.
Make me proud.
Ah, how did I not see that coming?
- Ah, "Turnaround Dance," huh?
- Yes, the young ladies ask the young men.
Ah, so the guys are sweatin' it out, huh?
Ha, ha, ha... poor dopes.
I'm glad those days are over.
- Good morning, George.
Jonathan.
- Oh, hi, Kat.
Ahh...
Miss Tompkins, I trust you're available to chaperone this Friday?
- Do I have a choice?
- No.
Can't wait.
And of course feel free to invite a gentleman.
After all, it is a "Turnaround Dance."
Oh, that's right.
Thanks.
Jonathan?
Yes.
A little higher on the right.
Turnaround dance, huh?
Girls ask the guys.
Merry Christmas to me.
Ah, it's about time the girls had to worry and sweat and write out a list of topics to talk about on their hands.
- You do that?
- No, never.
I'm just glad the pressure's off.
You know, we just get to sit back and wait.
Is that what you think, the pressure's off?
- Dream on, girls.
- Wait!
Come back, come back.
What?
Look, a turnaround dance tells you where you stand.
And the type of girl who asks you, tells you who you are.
- Well, who are you if nobody asks?
- Then you're you.
Well, how do you get asked by a cool girl?
- Positioning.
- Huh?
Look, you want a cool girl, hang near her locker.
Stay in her direct vision.
If she can't see you, she can't ask you.
Remember, positioning.
Hey, hey, hey, hey...!
Jacqueline, where you headed?
You know, I was just going that way.
OK, positioning.
We're in a main hallway, between the bathroom and a drinking fountain.
There's good foot-traffic.
All right, let's do it.
Shawn!
Come on, positioning.
How do you expect to get asked out with your head in a locker?
Shawn, would you go to the turnaround dance with me?
Becky?
How are you?
Sure, I'll go.
- Pick you up at eight?
- I'll wear something sexy.
Becky Scholtz...
I'm impressed, Shawn.
She's like the third coolest girl in our grade.
You know, the pressure's totally off you and all on me.
Ok...
OK, positioning.
Positioning.
Hey, Cory...
Shawn.
What are you guys doing?
Oh... uh... we're just...
standing and being here...
And hoping a girl asks you to the dance?
- Could be.
- Well, I'm not going.
My only hope.
I mean.... why?
It's a protest.
The concept of a turnaround dance, implies that all the other times, only the boys can do the asking.
That's destructive, gender-biased thinking, and we have to get beyond that.
Why?
Besides, that weekend, my daddy's taking me to New York for Christmas shopping.
I'll see you in class.
Oh, man, now I've got to find an above-average girl, who's into, "destructive, gender-biased thinking."
- How about Allison?
- Allison Cheever?
Get real.
Why, just because she's the coolest girl in our grade, you don't think she'd ask me?
If a bomb dropped on the school and every other boy was killed except you?
She'd go with the most popular dead guy.
(bell ringing)
- Come on, man, we've got class.
- Go...
learn.
My place is here.
(music swells)
- Cory?
- Yes.
Would you go to the Turnaround Dance with me?
Yes, I 'd love to go with you!
Yes?
You said, "yes"?
- Where'd you come from?
- I asked you and you said, "yes."
Cory Matthews and I are going to the dance.
I can't believe it.
An average guy said yes to me.
Listen, Ingrid, you know how you think I said I'd go to the dance with you?
You're gonna think this is pretty amazing, but see, that wasn't me.
See, there's this guy, who looks like me and sounds like me, but he's not me.
Now, I reported him to the police, but they keep arresting me.
Oh, yeah, that'll work.
- Dad!
- No, it's not me.
It's just a guy who looks like me.
And the both of us are wondering what the two of you are up to?
OK, look.
This girl Ingrid, she invited me to the Turnaround Dance and I don't want to go.
I mean, I wanna go, just not with her.
- But you said yes to her.
- Yeah, but my whole social standing for the rest of the year depends on which girl I'm there with.
Oh, that's different.
I understand.
Go with the girl you said yes to.
Eric, I don't want to hurt Ingrid, 'cause she's a really sweet girl.
But enough about her, get me out of this date.
- Look, you heard what Dad said.
- Oh, please, he's old.
He's out of touch.
I mean, the last girl he dated was Mom.
No, no, no, no...
Cor, Cor, Cor...
You have to go with Ingrid.
You bail on this girl, it's all over for you.
- Why?
It's one girl, one date.
- No, no, no...
You dump one girl, they're all gonna know and they're all gonna hate you.
Remember, women are in constant communication with each other.
What are you talking about?
Cor, did you enjoy the vegetarian chili mom made last night as much as I did?
You know, sometimes I think we take our great mom for granted.
Eric, could we please stick to my problem for a second here?
Yes, your problem.
Your problem is the international women's network.
Look, you blow off this girl, everybody online's gonna know about it in the morning.
- Oh, I don't believe that.
- Well, you could be right,
- then again...
- I didn't know you liked my chili.
What can I get my wonderful boys for dinner tomorrow night?
And bad news, it travels even faster.
... Shaw's play, Pygmalion, is filled with strong opinions about class prejudice.
You guys agree or disagree?
Wow, I didn't know they were taking the class picture today.
Come on.
How you speak, how you walk, affects how you're gonna do in life.
You guys believe that?
- (all murmur)
- Oh, come on.
What if day one I walked into this classroom... (Jersey accent) Hey, how ya doin'?
My name is Mr. Turner.
I gonna be learnin' yous guys some good English.
OK?
- What would you think?
- I'd have a shot at an A.
How you speak, how you look, affects people's perceptions of who you are.
- (bell ringing)
- Read Pygmalion, people!
Don't make me do this again tomorrow.
Cory, you're gonna love me.
I just figured out how to make your date with Ingrid work.
It's OK, Shawn, I've accepted my average fate.
No, look, you'd be happy to go to the dance with her if she was cool.
- Yeah, but she's not cool.
- So we make her cool.
- Is that possible?
- It's all here in the pig-play.
You know, we change her clothes, her hair... her whole look.
Shawn, we're guys.
What do we know about girls clothes?
Not much, but I'm thinking Becky Schultz knows a whole lot.
- You think she'd help us?
- Hey, she asked me to the dance, and I said yes.
So I figure I could ask her for something and she'd say yes.
You sure you wanna waste it on this?
- Hi, Kat.
- Hi, Jonathan.
Do you have any plans for the weekend?
You leaving town?
Holidays with the folks?
Actually, George has me chaperoning the Turnaround Dance.
Oh, right.
Yeah, that's the one where the girls ask the guys.
Yeah, and the guys sweat it out waiting.
Poor dopes.
Ha!
Yeah, poor dopes.
Poor, poor dopes.
Try a hammer, Mr. Turner.
All right, what do you think?
Ingrid with this hair?
And these lips.
All right, Morgan, go bring this upstairs to Ingrid and Becky.
- She's scary looking.
- Boys like that.
Boys shouldn't like that.
Look at these women, they're starved.
They've had lifts and implants.
All to just make them look like some idiotic male fantasy image of women.
Where did you find pictures like these?
In the magazines on your night stand.
Oh, you didn't open the drawer, did you?
Here she comes.
- Wow, she looks just like Becky.
- I am Becky.
Ladies and gentlemen, the new and improved Ingrid Iverson!
- Wow!
- Is it OK?
- Yeah.
- Nope.
- (all) What?
!
- I'm telling you, we missed.
- It doesn't work at all.
- Becky said I looked pretty.
Yeah, you do.
Shawn, what's with you?
She's gorgeous.
Fine, she's gorgeous.
What does that give you?
- Pretty much everything.
- Cory, we're going for cool here.
Cool is more than just looks.
It's an attitude, it's a feel.
Look.
This girl is exotic.
There's something mysterious about her.
She looks like her name would be, Ameretto, or Frangelico, or Kahlua.
You mean we need to give Ingrid a foreign name?
It is foreign.
It's Swedish.
Wait a minute, you mean, like Swedish from Switzerland?
Like from Sweden, where my mom's family lives.
You have family in Switzerland?
- Sweden.
- Yeah.
Yeah, we go there every summer.
My aunt Uma has a house on the beach.
Uma, Uma, Uma...
Oh, Cory, this is too good.
Come on, Shawn, what do you mean?
Ingrid, confirm or deny, in Sweden, at the beach... women... naked?
- Yeah, sure, it's no big deal.
- Wrong, it's a very big deal.
Yeah, for the Swedish guys, but what does it get us?
Cory, by this time tomorrow, I can make Ingrid cool at John Adams High.
And you cool by association.
But in order to do that, you must be willing to boldly go where no seventh graders have ever gone before.
- Are you with me?
- Yes, please.
No, no.
His plans never work.
- It's gonna blow up in our faces.
- I wanna be popular!
OK, we'll go with the Swede.
So, Cory's going out with Ingrid, right?
Did you know that she's Swedish?
Sweden, huh?
Is it true what they say?
- Ja, they sunbathe in the nude.
- Amazing.
- What about the schools?
- Nude.
- The malls.
- Nude.
At the Gap, all they sell are hats.
Ooh, here she comes.
Ooh, here she comes!
(whistling and jeers)
Wow, look at Ingrid.
She's so...
- Cool?
- Yeah, but what's with the clothes?
Well, it's really not for me to say, but underneath the clothes... nude.
- They're buying.
- Oh, yeah.
The girl in the white turtleneck, is that Ingrid Iverson?
- That's her.
- What on earth has she done to herself?
Oh, she didn't do it, we did.
Cory and me.
Cory and I, Mr. Hunter.
Oh, yeah, sure, now everybody wants to take credit.
So, ladies, tomorrow night at my place, a little pre-dance smorgasbord?
- Just say ja.
- OK.
Cory, can I talk to you for a minute?
Oh-oh.
- Cory, I can't go to the dance with you.
- Wha...?
You know how you guys wanted me to be cool?
- Yeah?
- It's working better than I ever dreamed.
This morning, Rick Lawler talked to me.
He's never talked to me before.
So I asked him to the dance and he said yes.
- Aren't you happy for me?
- Not especially.
I mean, you asked me first.
You and I are going.
A week ago, Rick Lawler didn't even know I was alive.
And now we're going out.
You wouldn't want me to pass that up, would you?
Yes, pass!
Cory, I could have never done this without you.
Thanks for everything.
On the cheek.
Sorry, man, I just heard.
It just happened!
Yeah, well, I'm tapped into the girls network.
Shawn, I gotta face facts.
I'm average.
And average guys don't get asked to dances.
It just doesn't happen.
Cory, would you take me to the dance?
Do you see her too?
Yeah, man, I do.
I heard what just happened with Ingrid and I'm really sorry.
But I'm also really happy, because I do need someone to take me to the dance.
Wait, wait, wait...
You're asking me?
Yes, would you?
I don't want to appear to be anxious, but... yes, yes, yes!
- You gonna go pick up your date now?
- Oh, no, no, no...
Tonight is Turnaround.
Tonight I sit down, relax, make myself pretty.
While the girl comes to the door, asks if I'm ready, and suffers through the nightmare interrogation by the parents.
(horn honking)
I feel so cheap.
But you know, I kind of like it.
Hey, Cor, come on, your ride's leaving!
- (Amy) Have a good time.
- So, what do you guys got planned?
Morgan's sleeping over at a friend's, and you guys are going to a dance...
We thought we'd finish trimming the tree, wrap a few presents and go to bed early.
- Careful, you don't want to overdo it.
- Yeah, you know, at our age...
Go on, go on, have a good time.
Get out.
Come on.
Goodbye.
- OK, bye.
- Love ya.
- They're gone.
- Lock the door.
They're gone, they're gone, they're gone...
Gone, gone, gone...
- So, you ready to turn in?
- Uh-huh.
Maybe a little wine first.
A little nibbly, a little you.
Easy, easy...
you don't want to overexert yourself.
No, not at our age.
Loosen up those muscles.
Come on, sit back.
- There you go...
- Ahh...
Merry Christmas, baby.
Well, here we are.
Is there a special VIP area for us popular couples?
Oh, well, thanks for bringing me.
Wait, wait... where you going?
Over there with Danny.
You know I'm going out with Danny, right?
- But you asked me.
- I asked you to take me.
See, my parents won't let me go out with ninth graders, so I always get somebody else to take me to the dances and then I meet up with Danny.
Everybody knows that.
- Didn't you know that?
- No!
When you asked me to take you to the dance,
I figured you wanted me to take you to the dance.
Stupid, stupid me!
- Well, thanks.
- No!
Keep your pity cheek-kiss.
Cory, just heard about you and Allison.
How do you do that?
- So you were dumped.
- Twice, Shawn.
Same dance.
It's gotta be a record.
Hey, you'll be in the yearbook.
Don't sweat it, man.
I'll go grab you a glass of punch and a big pile of cookies.
Good sugar rush and you'll be fine.
This is a school function, not the back seat of your car.
I expect while you're at this dance, that you behave with a reasonable amount of restraint.
- We were just talking, George.
- You're supposed to be chaperoning.
What if I just showed up, found a pretty woman, chatted her up, ignored the students and had a wonderful time?
Why don't you?
I guess I could.
There's Miss Sneider, over by the punch.
Yes...
Good choice.
Well, carry on.
So basically, you strung me along all week, not because you were considering anybody else, but because you get some sort of twisted pleasure out of watching me squirm?
Yep.
You weren't worried about somebody else just snapping me up?
Oh, I put the word out in the girls' network - hands off.
So you picked me before you picked me?
That's how it works.
You know, it's a pretty big room.
I think we could do a better job chaperoning, if we were moving around close together.
You looking one way, me looking the other...
- Do you wanna dance?
- I thought you'd never ask.
Ingrid?
Cory, is that you?
Yeah, what happened to you?
You're soaked.
A bunch of us popular couples were standing around the pool talking and everyone kept saying how cool it'd be to jump in.
- So all you jumped in?
- No, just me.
You see, the cool thing is talking about jumping in, not actually doing it.
I didn't know that.
Now I'm all wet, my contacts fell out and my cool boyfriend discovered a bunch of dry people he'd rather be with.
Here you go.
- Hi.
- Hi.
So, where's Allison?
With Danny Taylor...
her boyfriend.
- The one that everybody knows about.
- Oh, yeah.
- Sorry about that.
- Well, sorry about that.
Yeah, well, I guess that's what I get for trying to be one of the cool kids.
- Which clearly I'm not.
- I'm with you there.
Listen, Ingrid, I wanted to say I'm sorry for what Shawn and I did to you.
You know, changing you around and everything.
That's OK.
It was really fun for awhile until I hit the water.
No, see, we didn't do it for you, we did it for me.
So I could have a date that everyone else thought was cool.
Yeah, I knew that.
That's why I didn't feel bad about dumping you.
Until now.
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
You know what's funny?
We might have actually had a good time tonight, if we'd just come here together as ourselves.
Yeah, you may be right.
- I guess we'll never know.
- Guess not.
Unless...
Well, I mean, there's always next year.
- Hey, there's still this year.
- Yeah...
It doesn't matter if other people think we're cool.
We know who we are.
Are you Ingrid, the girl that jumped in the pool?
Yeah, that would be me.
- I think you're so cool -wanna dance?
- Yeah, sure.
Wait, wait, wait...
What about knowing who we are?
Give me a break.
Hey, just heard about you and Ingrid.
- The women's network, right?
- No, actually I was standing right here.
So where's Becky?
In the girls' room for six hours, like always.
- Hey, girls.
- Eric, not now, OK?
- Anytime but now.
- Why, 'cause you got dumped twice?
- Three times.
- Wow!
- I don't see you with your date.
- Yeah, where's Jacqueline?
Funny thing, her old boyfriend came into town.
Turns out things aren't over between them.
She hopes I'll understand.
- Do you?
- Oh, yeah.
Completely, you know, relaxed about the whole situation.
Hi, want a picture to remember the dance?
Drop dead!
Yeah, you're real relaxed, Eric.
No!
Wait, wait, wait...!
Come back!
Take a picture.
A picture of the three coolest guys at the dance.
- Yeah, all sittin' at the losers' table.
- Listen, if we smile now, in 20 years if anyone asks, our dates were all in the bathroom.
- Hey, mine really is.
- Ha-ha... shut up!
- All right, everybody say cheese.
- You've gotta say "dumped."
- Dumped.
- Dumped.
Cheese.
Eric, look at this.
Uh-oh.
Why don't you go on upstairs.
- What?
- Nothing here you need to see.
Why don't you just get on upstairs, OK?
Great.
Ah, you guys are gonna have such a nice evening.
Maybe it's not too late.
- You all warm and snuggly?
- Yeah, don't stop.
Your turn to do me.
I've been doing you for uh six hours?
!
Ten more minutes.
"Yoko Transformation!
A Creeping Bloodlust
Shachi-sama...
Well?
He hasn't made any particularly suspicious moves.
I don't know what he's thinking.
We should be wary of him.
Why is Yomi-sama so interested in a newcomer like Kurama?
but I don't trust him.
Don't take your eyes off of him.
is there any way for our nation to prevail?
and am working to implement it.
Oh?
I should be able to bring five... 000 points.
I'm impressed that you would cooperate so constructively with me.
you had a heart of ice.
But you've changed. with whom you are not even blood relatives?
I'd like to oversee how high the people I have chosen are raising their spectral power ratings.
I will return to the Human Realm for a time.
I'm depending on you.
"Meio Private Academy
let me see your answer sheet.
huh?
That sounds like you.
thanks.
are you?
You might say that.
we'll help you.
I'm going to end up fighting Yusuke and Hiei.
W- what?
For real?
Yeah.
you seem to be enjoying it.
Must be my biorhythms.
I've been overcome by the sensation of also being the Yoko Kurama.
I realize how terribly belligerent I'm becoming.
Shuichi-san!
Are you out here?
Shuichi-kun.
Shuichi-san!
Are you not feeling well?
I'm fine.
and my new younger brother.
Having two Shuichis could make things confusing.
A pager?
Do you have a girl?
It's my new little brother.
He's using it to entertain himself.
He's treating me like I'm his gopher now.
it's me.
Brother Shu... and all.
I thought we could go home together.
Do not come all the way to my school.
whether you like it or not.
don't say that.
I'm only doing my job.
It's not like I think you'd run away.

Hiei is? the substructure is undergoing changes.
didn't Yomi ever tell you?
You must treat hostages with respect.
You're one galling bastard.
You watch your tone with me.
this kid's head could come apart from his body in a snap.
stupid?
Hostages only mean anything if they're kept safe.
like you were ordered to.
besides killing him.
one by one.
Do not make me too angry.
There are times occasionally when I don't care what happens.
myself.
Shall I try them out?
S- sorry!
My fault!
I just got a little carried away. the one where you're bringing six people
000 points within half a year... is that coming along?
Yeah.
000 points.
R- really? you know.
of course.
With one exception.
you're here.
How are the six of them doing?
They've got quite a knack for this.
They're more rewarding to teach than Yusuke was.
Yo!
Nice to see you.
Their spectral powers have risen again.
the Spirit Realm will find out about them.
what have you got planned?
right? as well as the Human and Spirit Realms. and Yomi have all kept each other in check. a conflict between Yomi and Mukuro is unavoidable.
You don't mean...!
Are you planning on becoming a third power!
?
I don't know.
That depends on what move Yusuke makes.
huh?
Such a strange relationship you share. that's what you've agreed upon.
rather than collude...
that's the relationship we appear to have.
let me handle it.
The current Special Defense Squad captain is more understanding than Otake was.
Kurama!
as usual.
the stronger I get.
I'm astounded.
Who would have ever thought that I could get my spectral power up this high!
?
Everyone should have such an excellent teacher.
huh?
I'd sure like to fight him again soon.
the most important thing for us is to raise our base spectral power up even higher. will be sure to work hard to repay your kindness.
I really resent all of this!
are you still going on about that? I'd like for you to double your current spectral powers.
- All right!
- All right!
- All right!
Another half-year... the more my technique flourishes!
The wind has gotten much colder.
How about I work up a sweat?
Devil Yo-Yos!
so forgive me.
Shot!
This is where I show off my training!
Shot!
huh?
It looks like you still haven't reached a spectral power rating huh?
We're going to train even harder!
Shachi?
are you sure about this?
We haven't heard a peep from Kurama.
That lousy Kurama spouted off about bringing six people 000 points here.
But are you sure he wasn't just bluffing?
How is it that you have included a liar like him as one of your advisors?
He is going to bring detriment to our nation in the future!
I can't help but think so!
I will bear in mind your feelings of concern for our nation.
for your kind words. do it over something else.
Wretched Kurama...!
I'm not going to let him get away with this!
800 points!
all six of them have spectral power ratings 000 points.
That can't be!
How in the world did you...?
What kind of sorcery have you performed?
A good diet and moderate exercise.
That's all it took.
Good"?
You mean those poisonous-tasting herbs!
?
Huh? "Moderate exercise"!
?
It was hell!
You gotta be jokin'!
That was not beautiful training!
Well done.
I shall reward you. and command these six.
sir.
Yomi-sama!
These guys were all trained up by Kurama.
There's the risk of insurrection.
Shachi!
what the hell have you done?
Huh?
But sir... your spectral power is the second greatest in our nation.
you're incompetent.
I- incompetent? have you ever raised up anyone that had any superior spectral power?
you never even looked for a single person did you?
Kurama has brought us six of them.
then what are you?
that's enough.
Everyone acknowledges Shachi's outstanding spectral power.
It would be cruel to expect anything more from him.
you...!
I'll kill you!
000!
I'll show you!
I know you're there.
Come on out.
Shachi...
Are you prepared for the punishment for this?
Hmph!
You think I'd leave any evidence behind!
?
bones and all!
Yomi has indeed become more patient.
Yomi has been waiting for someone capable of defeating you.
Don't be ridiculous!
do you read me?
I read you.
kill the kid immediately.
but I don't take orders from you any more.
What!
?
Kurama.
Kara!
?
Hey!
To think there could be this much difference made over one hostage. he would find a way to threaten you without actually taking any hostages.
You are correct.
you...! no matter how you struggle!
To hell with you!
W- what!
?
Looks like my duty is over.
Brother...?
W- what's this...?
Don't ever play your trump card first.
eh?
Kurama became Yomi's military chief of staff.
the Number-Two man in Yomi's nation has changed.

MAN:
There is no prouder day in a father's life than the day he can pass on to his child the things that matter most to him.
[CAR DOOR CLOSES]
MAN:
Today is that day.
David?
Johnny L.'s here.
MAN:
I'm a very old man.
I have lived longer than I should have.
I've buried two sons.
And two grandsons.
[COUGHING]
Are you all right, sir?
[CLEARS THROAT]
I've waited... and at last, that day has come when my great-grandson can step in and take my place.
It's today?
They're sending Carey in a car to get you.
They'll be here any minute.
You think he's too young?
I was less than 20 when my father, God rest his soul, put all this in my hands.
Now it's David's turn.
He may be young, but don't think he's weak.
No, he's strong, as strong as I was then.
He's a Constantine.
The last.
Get his coat.
Leave him here.
It'll be safer.
My great-grandfather will send people.
David, they want you, not them.
You don't know where we're going, you don't know anything.
David, this is--
You can send for them later, okay?
[CAR APPROACHING]
The back.
Go out the back!
Go, let's go!
You stay here.
[DOORBELL CHIMES]
[DOORS SLAMMING]
What's that?
They're getting away.
Let's go.
[TIRES SQUEALING]
Okay.
There is no harder day in a father's life than the day he must discipline a child.
But love demands sacrifices from us all.
The family must be protected.

NARRATOR:
He was brought across in 1228.
Preyed on humans for their blood.
Now, he wants to be mortal again...
To repay society for his sins...
To emerge from his world of darkness...
From his endless forever night.

[SIREN WAILING]
SCHANKE:
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You-
- You owe me, Carter.
CARTER:
I can't, Schanke.
Family stuff, man.
What "family stuff"?
I covered you on your birthday.
All right, all right, I'm sorry.
Maybe next time, all right?
Yeah, well, maybe not.
[SIGHS]
Hey, Rosin.
What are you doing Sunday?
Do you want to talk a trade?
Yeah, well, see if I lend you my electric lumbar pillow again.
Creep.
Oh, man, do I look like a soft touch?
I help these guys out all the time.
I spotted Carter on his birthday.
Now, when I ask him to do me a favor, it's like I don't exist.
I just want to go to the cottage, spend time at the lake for Father's Day with my wife and kid, but no.
We're off Sunday.
No, no, no.
You're off Sunday.
Correction.
Cohen saw my time card, said I was six hours late in the last three months, so she added an extra shift.
I miss enough of my daughter's life as it is, you know, working nights.
Now I've got to miss her special chocolate pudding cake.
I'll cover for you.
I'll cover for you.
You-
- You'd do that?
Yeah.
Oh, man.
No strings?
No strings.
Why not?
Go on, be with your family.
I owe you bigtime, Nick.
Yeah.
Just not the electric lumbar pillow, okay?
Are you expecting a call from Johnny Lamar, detective?
Uh, no.
Well, he called.
He said he's bringing in David Constantine tonight.
David Constantine's turning on the family?
You mean he's talking?
Apparently, your partner set it up.
Let's not get too excited here, captain.
Because, you know, Johnny Lamar talks a good game, but he doesn't always deliver.
He says he's gonna deliver him into protective custody if you meet him at Bleecker and Bridge in half an hour.
David Constantine is next in line for the throne.
If this is for real--
His testimony could put his family's business out of business.
The old man'll be spending his few remaining days in a prison hospital, which would make me very happy.
I suggest you go meet the man.
Anything to keep a smile on your face, captain.
Just try to be on time.
SCHANKE:
What is that word?
It-
- It means "generous," but it starts with an A.
"Altruistic"?
"Altruistic." Good word.
What is that?
Oh, it's some kind of questionnaire.
It's for Jenny's school project.
"What is a father?"
Oh, it sounds really...
Silly?
Well, it is silly, but you know, it's Jenny's...
And?
What is a father?
A sucker for doing this silly form.
[ENGINE IDLING]
[CUTS OFF ENGINE]
I don't think this is gonna put that smile on the captain's face.
Two in the back, one in the head, from about 25 or 30 feet away.
Nice marksmanship.
I'd say they were professionals.
KNIGHT:
Any sign of a passenger?
Well, if he was here, he got away clean.
He was here.
It's all over town now.
David Constantine ran out on the family, and the old man has every available soldier out looking for him.
Maybe they took him.
Just because he isn't lying here clammy doesn't mean he got away.
COHEN:
All I know is David Constantine was supposed to be a witness for the Crown.
Instead, he's a missing person.
If he's still alive, we have to find him fast.
If little David gave him the slip,
I don't like the odds.
I mean, where the hell would he go?
The Constantines aren't exactly the type of family you just leave.
Not alive, anyway.
[BUOY CLANGING]
[SEAGULLS SQUAWKING]
Hey!
That hasn't been inspected.
Mr. Constantine.
I-
- I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't realize you were...
Go right ahead, sir.
I appreciate the kindness.
Welcome to the New World.
Don Constantine.
At your humble service.
I have an arrangement at the hospital.
Ah...
I had to leave Paris in a hurry.
I didn't get the chance to bring much.
This will be enough.
Will you be followed?
The West Coast, I think, will be safest.
Do you have a preference?
Los Angeles, then.
And a new name.
No?
Los Angeles will be fine.
You're not what I expected.
You thought I'd be older.
I could say the same of you, sir.
My father died last year.
I run this family now.
I assure you, whatever you need will be taken care of.
Whatever you need.
MRS. CONSTANTINE:
Is there a...?
Has something happened?
We're trying to locate your husband, ma'am.
Now, do you have any idea where he might have gone?
Uh, he's in New York.
On business.
Is there a problem?
Oh, you could say that.
When was the last time you saw Johnny Lamar, Mrs. Constantine.
Uh, it must be two weeks ago.
He wasn't here earlier tonight?
What's this all about?
What's happened?
Johnny Lamar is dead, Mrs. Constantine.
Now your husband could be next if we don't find him before his great-grandfather does.
Don't be ridiculous.
David's great-grandfather?
He's family.
He looks out for us.
Why on earth would he want to hurt David?
To keep him from talking to us.
My husband would have no reason to talk to you, detective.
And I don't think I do, either.
David could be in real danger.
I think you know that.
You all could be in danger.
We'll be fine.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Listen, if you, um...
If you change your mind, you know who to call, and if you hear from your husband--
Good night, detective.
What do you have to say to get through to some people?
What?
Nothing.
WOMAN:
See you.
MAN:
Good night.
SCHANKE:
Cohen is gonna become a little drill sergeant after this development.
[CHUCKLES]
Hello?
You coming?
Uh, you go ahead.
There's something I need to check out.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
There's something you gotta check out?
And you want me to tell the captain we've got nothing?
No way.
No, no, no.
I'm not letting you off this one.
You come with me.
You owe me one, remember?
For Sunday.
Yeah.
So... it's question time on Night Watch, gentle listeners.
I see by the old clock on the wall that it's very nearly Father's Day.
So tonight's question is...
"What is...a father?"
[MIMICS PHONE RINGING]
We have a caller.
And the caller says that a father is...
"altruistic."
[MIMICS BUZZER]
Too bad.
Thanks for playing, though.
Every parent wants something in return.
Love.
Loyalty.
Nothing is free.
And so, boys and girls, the Night Crawler wants to know... what did your father promise you?
Did he promise to take care of you?
[GATE CREAKS]
Did he keep his promise?
[¶]
Police.
David Constantine, I presume.
Are you a real cop?
Nick Knight, Metro Homicide.
A lot of people are looking for you.
I didn't kill Johnny.
I didn't say you did.
Why don't I just take you downtown.
You can give your statement to to the prosecutor.
No.
Look, detective,
I know you're doing your job, but I got to ask you, walk away like you never saw me.
I know what you're used to, Mr. Constantine.
I'm not for sale.
I'm not offering.
I'm begging.
I'm putting my life in your hands.
My family...
If they think that I betrayed them,
I'm a dead man.
Anywhere you take me, I'm a dead man.
Once you testify against your great-grandfather, he'll be in jail, and he can't hurt you anymore.
He can never hurt you again.
I can't testify against him.
He's my family.
It was never about taking him down.
Johnny Lamar thought it was.
He thought that was a way for me to get out.
But that's not who I want to be.
I don't want to turn against my family.
I just want to... start over again.
Somewhere far away.
I grew up with killing, but I don't want to be a killer.
[BUOY CLANGING]
[SPEAKING FRENCH]
Where have you been?
What is that?
I will not ask you again.
[CHUCKLES]
Ancient medicinal herbs.
Rare Chinese elixirs.
Nicholas... still searches for a cure.
[BAG THUMPS]
Why didn't you just tell me that you'd been to the apothecary?
There's no need for secrets between us.
Is that how you thank me?
Is this how you repay me?
This has nothing to do with you.
Of course it's to do with me!
I gave you life.
I gave you power!
I gave you my eternal protection.
And you... want to go back.
Can you imagine how that makes me feel?
You will stop this pathetic search for a cure.
You make a fool of yourself, and a fool of me.
You're my creature, Nicholas!
Made in my image.
Then I am a monster.
[GROWLS]
Why are you doing this to me?
I've done nothing to you, Lacroix.
You did this.
Perhaps there is no cure.
But that won't stop me from leaving you.
Kill me if you wish.
Either way...
I will leave you.
DAVID:
I gotta get away.
The police can't protect me.
You must know that.
[SIGHS]
I should never have come back here.
I just wanted to make sure they were all right.
I wanted to give them a different kind of life.
I don't want my son to grow up the way I did.
COHEN:
You had him and you didn't bring him in?
KNIGHT:
He didn't want to come.
He just wants to walk away.
Do I look like I care what he wants?
He could be the key to bringing down the Constantine family once and for all.
He could be dead before we even get him to courtroom.
Captain, we can't absolutely guarantee his safety here.
The Constantines have got to people on death row, let alone a police precinct.
He's not going to testify.
He's not wanted for anything.
There are no warrants.
Thanks for the legal briefing, detective.
He won't last a day without our protection.
[SIGHS]
Ooh, she took that well, I thought.
You still have your gun and your badge, don't you?
You know, she is right.
He's not safe out there.
He wouldn't be any safer in here.
Are you still doing that questionnaire on fatherhood?
Shh.
Yeah, why?
A father is someone who will sacrifice everything to give his child a better life than he had.
That is great.
"A father is someone who will..."
Now, what's the rest of it?
"Sacrifice anything..."
Nick!
What's...?
LAMBERT:
Oh, come on, Nick.
What did you expect?
You knew she wasn't gonna like it.
She's been trying to salt Thomas Constantine's tail ever since I was an intern.
Getting David killed isn't going to help.
No, and you did what you thought was right.
You cut him loose.
Well, not exactly.
What do you mean, not exact--
Where is he?
My place.
Nick, you're a cop!
You can't get involved in--
Okay.
All right, all right.
Why?
Because I know how powerful his family is.
The captain's right.
He's not gonna get away without some help.
It's dangerous.
It's not that easy.
Even when they're trying to kill you, they're still your family.
Yowch.
That sounds like an epitaph.
Was it really that hard for you?
Leaving them?
Parts of it.
Nicholas.
Did Lacroix find you?
He was so angry.
Yes, he found me.
I have to leave.
He'll never let me live as long as I'm searching for a cure.
But you can never find one.
Forget about it.
Stay.
No.
I can't.
I can't live as we do anymore!
I'll leave Paris tonight, before he can find me again.
Come with me.
And do what?
This is my home.
I'm sorry.
[SIGHS]
You will go to Don Constantine in America.
He knows about us, about our kind.
He helps us when we need to travel.
He can help you disappear.
I'll make the arrangements immediately, and you'll sail within the hour.
You'll need this.
MRS. CONSTANTINE:
It can't be true.
David would never want to leave.
He loves his family.
He's always taken good care of his family.
That is how he was raised.
He wants what's best for you and your son, even if it means crossing Thomas Constantine.
Don't be silly.
David's great-grandfather wants what's best for us too.
He has always taken good care of us.
Did you know that Constantine was planning on turning over the business to your husband?
Yeah, everyone knew, from the day David was born.
Well, that's why he's doing this.
Take a look at the old man.
Take a look at the world he lives in.
That's not the kind of life
David wants for you.
DAVID:
Why doesn't she call?
Why doesn't she come?
It's a big decision for her, David, giving up everything she knows.
They're my family, for God's sake.
Doesn't she know I'm trying to help them?
[DOOR SLAMS]
There she is.
I thought you said she'd have to buzz to get up.
Get down!
[FOOTSTEPS RECEDING]
[DOOR SLAMS]
What are you?
The only thing that can protect you.
DAVID:
My, uh, great-grandfather told me that there were creatures in this world that... nobody knows about today.
KNIGHT:
Your great-grandfather's fortune was built on deals that can't face the light of day.
Men with secrets will always pay men like Constantine to help them hide.
You know him?
I knew him.
I know what it's like... not wanting to be what you are.
MAN:
I know it sounds hard to believe, sir, but he really was that strong.
It was like the bullets didn't even faze him.
Did he change?
"Change"?
His eyes.
You know him?
I know his kind.
[ROCK MUSIC BLARING]
Who is your friend?
Oh, no.
No, no, no, get him out of here.
You can't just keep dragging people in here every time you don't know what else to do with them.
Go get yourself a drink.
Relax.
It's just until I can set up his disappearance.
He won't be staying long.
He's not staying at all.
I have to do business in this town, Nicholas, with Constantine.
Liquor license, health inspections.
I cannot afford trouble.
I didn't realize you were afraid of Constantine.
After all, he's just a man.
He's a fanatic.
He would kill anyone, betray anyone, to protect his family.
Wouldn't we all?
[JANETTE SPEAKING FRENCH]
We can get a new one.
I don't want a new one.
I like that one!
[SPEAKING FRENCH]
Nonsense.
He will always be part of us.
You know that.
JANETTE:
That was different.
You were confused and you needed us.
I needed to get away and you led him right to me.
You know I was trying to help you.
I'm sure you were.
Stay out of it this time.
And don't call his daddy to come and get him.
Fine.
It's his funeral.
Excuse me.
David, you'll be okay here for a couple of hours.
I'll go and arrange for you to, uh, get lost.
[CRICKETS CHIRPING]
[ENGINE SHUTS OFF]
[WHOOSHING]
You haven't changed a bit.
Last I heard, you were in Chicago.
I moved.
So I see.
And you're the man who has my grandson, hmm?
The policeman.
Vampire, Homicide cop.
[CHUCKLING]
That's certainly one for the record book...
[COUGHING]
Well, I...
I remember you, Nicholas... whatever you're calling yourself.
The man who ran out on his family...
Who put himself before the ones he owed his life to.
Well, this is my family you're interfering with now.
I don't allow interference.
Don't send your people after David again.
You don't want the kind of trouble
I can make for you.
Oh, I'll go after him, all right, and I'll keep going until I find him.
There's no way to hide in this world.
Oh, that's right.
Someone will always betray you.
Yeah, you see, I remember you too.
You met me when I was a young man, remember that?
I've raised two sons and two grandsons, and I lost them all.
But you wouldn't understand.
You'll be young forever.
[CHUCKLES]
For me, family is all that's left.
My version of immortality.
[LAUGHING]
[COUGHS]
David's like another son to me.
It's my last chance to pass on what I've built, what I am.
He doesn't want it.
All right?
He does not want it.
If he really is like a son to you, why don't you be like a good father and let him do what he wants, not what you want.
What he wants doesn't matter.
He's a Constantine.
A prince can only be a prince, not a pauper.
I don't believe it.
You never did.
LACROIX:
It's a beautiful night out there, isn't it, boys and girls?
I haven't seen a night quite like this in a hundred years.
In fact, this is no night to be inside.
Let's turn off our radios, go out, and play.
Oh.
[CHUCKLING]
You don't look well, Don Constantine.
Time's a bitch, isn't it?
I'm here for the favor that you owe me.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
I haven't seen him.
No.
I gave this to him.
He was to keep it until the day he died.
So either you helped him, with this as payment, or you killed him.
I would be most unhappy if it were the latter.
I assure you, he's fine.
He's...traveling.
Ah.
But where?
He probably told you that his life was in danger.
I can't imagine where he got that idea.
I am simply trying to keep my family together, Don Constantine.
Surely you can understand that.
I would be eternally grateful for your help in this matter.
DON CONSTANTINE:
I won't have David leaving the family.
It can't be allowed.
I did the favor you asked me.
One man to another.
One father to another.
Now I want that favor returned.
I have an excellent memory for old accounts.
You would have brought me his head on a platter if I'd asked you to.
Is that what you'd like me to do for you?
Ah-ah, now, be careful.
I do tend... to take things literally.
I don't know what you're doing here, detective.
This really has nothing to do with you.
It's a family matter.
I just have one question to ask you.
Did you think you were helping David when you told Constantine where he was?
I-I don't know what you're talking about.
You knew David was staying in my house.
Did you know that Constantine sent two of his men to kill him?
N-no, they were supposed to bring him back.
I just want to put everything back the way it was before.
Well, that's not going to happen.
Constantine kills anyone who betrays his family, even David.
But I thought if he came back, he'd be safe.
If he came back?
If he came back to be just like his great-grandfather?
Is that what you want for him?
Is that what you want for your son?
All that I want for my son right now is his father, but I don't know where he is!
I mean, is this how David takes care of us?
By running out, by not being here on Father's Day?
I have to go.
David wants you to go with him.
That's what this is all about.
You have to decide which is more important to you.
Constantine's family or your own.
Hi, Nat.
Hey, you.
Hey, have you seen Schanke?
The captain wants to see him.
I'm him.
Of course you are.
Actually, I'm subbing in so he could be with his family.
Oh.
Oh, please.
You're making me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
Speaking of which,
I have a hungry cat at home, evidence to deliver, and, since no one volunteered to sub for me...
[SIGHS]
Next time.
[COUPLE CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY]
LACROIX:
I must say,
I commend your choice, Nicholas.
Los Angeles has such... possibilities,
Although rather too much sun for my liking.
Let us not make a scene, shall we?
How did you find me?
I shall always find you, Nicholas.
Let's just forget all about this little episode, shall we?
I wouldn't like to... hold it against you.
What do you want?
Do I have to want anything?
Let's talk about families, Nicholas.
That seems to be what's on everyone's mind.
What is a father?
A father is the man who made you what you are.
And like it or not, Nicholas,
I am the only father that you've got.
And, as a father,
I must say I'm very disappointed in you--
Sticking your nose in where it's not wanted.
Constantine came to you.
It's a matter of an old debt.
I want you to stay out of this.
I think a child owes his father that much courtesy.
And what about what a father owes his child?
It works both ways, you know.
Let's see... what your friend Schanke has to say about that, shall we?
"A father provides love, discipline, guidance, protection and support."
That's not bad.
He left out "freedom."
So would I.
Well, let's stop beating about the bush.
If David Constantine does not return to his family,
I will find him and kill him.
You're not strong enough to stop me, Nicholas.
Why do you care, anyway?
I think you understand.
Maybe I do.
Well, then, why don't you do for David what you would never do for me?
Let him go.
[DOOR OPENS]
Is it done?
And if I said it was?
What do you mean?
There's only one way that this can end.
You know how stubborn children are.
The boy wants to leave.
That isn't going to change.
He thinks there's some better life out there than what I can give him.
It's always about what they want, isn't it?
They can be so thoughtless.
Do you want him killed?
Is that what you want?
DON CONSTANTINE:
They were supposed to take my place.
David's grandfather, Dimitri, my oldest.
He looked just like me.
He's the one who should be standing here today.
Ah...
Well, this isn't an easy business.
You take some casualties.
Dimitri was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
We lost his brother, Stephan, in the big war.
I remember thinking
I'd never make it another 25 years until Dimitri's boys were old enough to take over, and then another 25 until David was ready!
David's uncle died in Vietnam.
His father made it back.
Well...
he didn't really come back.
He didn't last five years.
I'm an old...tired man... just hanging on.
Without David, it all ends.
The family, the business, everything we are.
He and his son are the last of the Constantines.
When I die, everything I built will have disappeared.
But that doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
But it means everything to me.
You owe me.
I don't know if she's coming, David.
Why don't you get in the truck?
No.
Y--
You don't understand.
I can't leave without them.
I didn't do this for me.
There's no point in leaving if I have to leave them behind.
She's got to make her own decision.
Otherwise, you might as well have stayed.
[DISTANT TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING]
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
[LAUGHING]
Oh.
DAVID:
Oh, thank God you're here.
Hey!
Oh...
Where are we going?
It's all right.
Don't worry.
The truck will take us to the Hamilton Airport.
Nick...took care of everything.
Go, quickly.
[CAR DOOR CLOSES]
We both know how that would end, Nicholas.
Take your family, David, and go.
I'll try to hold him off.
What do you mean?
You're stronger than--
[QUIETLY] Oh.
Karin and Adam are leaving.
No.
[SIGHS]
I'll run the family, if you want me to run the family.
Or you can shoot me, if you want to shoot me.
But my son... is not gonna be raised like this.
Well, that noble streak is endearing.
You get it from your Uncle Stephan.
A wise old man once told me... that love demands sacrifices from us all.
Well, it's my turn... to let go.
Are you telling me that--?
I've buried... enough sons for a lifetime.
That's not the legacy I want to leave.
I hear that Los Angeles is a place to start over.
They need persons like you, with your energy, to help them rebuild.
Hmph.
What did you say to him?
Oh, the old man was simply concerned to have someone to run the business after he died.
Personally,
I don't think he's ever looked fitter.
He could live for another hundred years.
I owed him a favor.
You're gonna wind up with an extra shift, you know.
Yeah, with any luck, it'll be on my daughter's birthday.
[SIGHS]
Listen.
I-I want to thank you for standing in for me.
Before you say it was nothing, it was something.
It was really important to me, and... well, it just meant a lot to me, and I want to thank you.
You're welcome.
So did I miss anything?
Not really.
Where's my questionnaire?
LACROIX:
Good evening, Toronto.
As all the night creatures come out of their dens, the Night Crawler is on the air... and whose little ears are listening tonight?
It's a school night, so how about a little education?
"I am thy father's spirit,
"doomed for a certain term
"to walk the night...
"And in the porches of mine ear did pour the leperous dist--"
What's this, gentle listeners?
A visitor?
Happy Father's Day.
I'm not coming back to you.
I just wanted to say thank you.
[INHALES DEEPLY]
They say, "If you love someone,
"let them go.
"If they're really yours,
"they will learn their lessons and return."
I can wait.
I have all the time in the world.
[¶]
Where are you?
Oh.
Hello, beautiful.
[Kissing Sound]
Did you miss me?
Dad, I've given this some thought... and I've decided that since Damien and Ralph have their own rooms, well, there's no reason why they should be bringing their junk into my room.
Well, how does that sound, Helen?
- [Gulping] - [Door Opening]
- Out of the way, stick boy!
- Hand Foot is here to stay.
- Oops, kicked your baby monkey.
- Get out of here, Ralph!
- Here, take this.
- Go away, Damien.
This is my room.
Was.
Now it's also the world headquarters of Hand Foot, Incorporated.
- Hand Foot all the way!
- Hand Foot, Hand Foot, Hand Foot!
- Hand Foot?
You guys aren't gonna make a dime.
- Okay, we'll use this.
- Yeah!
- Hey, that's my life savings!
- Consider yourself our silent partner.
- Yeah, say something and you're dead.
- Yeah.
- How's the big move going?
- Great.
- Good.
Come on, Ralph.
Gotta get to work.
Dad?
[Clears Throat]
Dad... well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've decided that...
- s-s-since Damien and Ralph have their own room...
- Preston, they need the space for their business.
- Not my space.
- Young man, in this family, industry gets rewarded.
While you're in here playing, your brothers are hard at work.
- Yeah, kissing' butt for money.
- [Ralph] Well, you know the golden rule.
- He who has the gold makes the rules.
- One day you'll have a job.
- When I was your age, I had my own business cleaning wheels.
- [Mimicking Dad]
I was pulling down 100 bucks a week polishing cars.
- You used to say 75.
- Well, you gotta think big, Preston.
- Surprise.
- [Brothers] Whoa, check it out.
Yeah, it's for your business.
We had a spare at the office.
- Damien, the speakers are out in the hall.
- How does it work?
It imitates human intelligence, like you guys.
- Preston, maybe you could teach your brothers how to use it.
- Not possible.
[Dad] The software will teach you how to do everything but make love to a woman.
- Now I know what programme to get your father for Christmas.
- Mom!
- Oops!
Uh, here.
Let me help you with that.
- Preston, you're gonna be late...
- for Butch's birthday party.
- Who wants to celebrate Butch's birth?
- [Dad] It's important to get out of your room more.
- [Brothers] Our room.
Well, good luck, guys.
[Computer Beeps, Talks] Damien and Ralph sleep... butt to face, butt to face,
- butt to face,
- Huh?
- Who said that?
- Butt to face, butt to face,
- Type "Quit." Hit "Delete."
- Butt to face, butt to face, butt to face...
- Turn it off!
Pull the plug!
- Ow!
- Don't rub it.
Be a man.
- [Moaning] Ouch!
- Little wimp.
[Dad] Come on, Preston.
You don't want to be late for Butch's birthday party.
- Are you gonna have fun today?
- [Preston] How can I, Dad?
- I don't have any money.
- Now, look.
Here's a couple of bucks.
Ah, heck, you can have fun all day on that.
You don't get out much, do you, Dad?
[P.A.] Welcome to Fun Land.
Fun, fun, fun for everyone.
Welcome to Fun Land.
Fun, fun, fun for everyone.
- Hey.
Hey, man.
- Hey, Butch.
Hey, man.
Yeah!
Hey, what's up?
Oh, look.
It's Presto the Pesto.
- Hello, Butch.
- [Kids Laughing]
Oh!
- Tokens!
- [Kids Cheering]
- Give me 50.
It's my birthday.
- Fifty.
- Twenty-five, please.
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-seven.
- Twenty-seven.
- Six, please.
- Six.
Six.
- Coming?
- I don't know.
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
- [Shouting]
- It's gonna be awesome!
- Yeah, let's go over here!
- This one!
- Hurry!
[Butch] Hey, Preston!
Hey, over here!
- Hey, Preston, how's your ostrich?
- Watch out!
Preston has an ostrich!
Hey, Preston, come with us!
- Just kidding!
- [Laughing]
[Groaning]
[Dad] Did you have fun at Butch's birthday party?
I have a question.
Are we broke?
- No, we just have to watch our spending habits.
- That's right.
Like when your mother calls her sister back East and talks for 97 minutes.
So if we're not poverty-stricken, there must be some other reason I'm so deprived.
- We're outta here!
Whoo!
- Goin' to the ball game.
- Can I go?
- We bought tickets, toad.
- [Mother] Damien!
- You need some cash?
- Nah, we got a bunch of change.
- Later, Preston.
It's not fair.
Why can't I have anything?
Well, Preston, they have jobs, and they've learned to save.
How can I save money if I don't have any?
A penny saved is a penny earned.
- What do you want for your birthday?
- Money... so I can pay to have Ralph and Damien knocked off.
Anything else?
Well, maybe we'll give him one of his birthday presents early.
A gift came from Grandma today.
Hmm.
What a rip-off!
It's a cheque for nothing!
I'm having a bad day.
Oh, your grandma just forgot to fill in how much it was for, but she signed it at the bottom, see?
It's a blank cheque.
- We'll just fill in the amount.
- How much did you get last year, honey?
A thousand.
- Ten dollars.
- Wait, Dad.
What about inflation?
- Oh, make it 11.
- [Muttering]
You'd be surprised how fast... eleven dollars can grow with interest.
Preston?
Preston?
[Preston] Eleven dollars... at 3.45 interest.
[Computer] Your account will reach... one million dollars... in 342,506 years.
I'm stuck here forever.
- [Dad] Lights out up there.
- Why?
My house, my rules.
"My house, my rules."
My own house.
[Yawning]
[Engine Stops, Car Door Shutting]
[Man] Dave, who needs assets?
I'm your asset.
- I'm a big asset.
Oh, c...
- [Man On Phone] I can't believe you.
Dave, Dave.
Come on, come on.
Why only borrow 150,000?
Our money is your money.
Round it off to two.
- Do I qualify?
- Of course you qualify for the loan, Dave.
We're golf partners.
- You don't look happy to see me.
- Quig...
- Quigley.
- Quigley.
That's funny.
I don't remember you stuttering on the witness stand.
- You just sang like a bird, didn't you?
- I had no choice, Carl.
- I mean, lying in court...
- You also pointed at me.
- That hurt.
- Well, I was under oath.
- I mean...
- Come here.
The only reason you're alive, Biderman, is I knew I might need you again someday...
like today.
Oh, sure.
You need a loan?
The rates are great now.
- And you get a toaster.
- I don't need a toaster.
Before I went away, I put aside a little nest egg.
[Gasping] These bills, they're marked consecutively.
- They'd trace these in a minute.
- That's right.
- [Coughing]
- That's where you come in, old buddy.
I want new bills.
- We're back in the SL business, Biderman.
- Ah, money laundering...
- is very difficult these days, Carl.
- You still do it though, don't you?
That's a good-looking family right there.
You're not gonna hurt them, are you?
- Hate to have to.
- All right.
How do you want to do this?
- I'll send my guy in tomorrow with a cheque for a million.
- Tomorrow?
Yep, just like the old days.
You give him the cash, unmarked, send him on his way.
- Whom should I expect?
- Whom should...
Whom should you expect?
His name is Juice.
- Juice?
- Mmm, he'll be here in exactly 24 hours.
Let's call it 1:00.
Come on.
Walk me out.
Show a little respect.
Whoa.
I know how you feel.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Can you see okay?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, sure.
I would like to open an account, please.
Eleven dollars.
Do you have any other money you'd like to deposit, Mr Waters?
Oh, uh, I could, but it's sort of hard to save around my house; that's why I'm here.
I'm afraid we have a minimum balance.
It's $200.
Two hundred dollars?
That could take a million years.
Well, whenever you're ready, please come back and see me.
My name's Shay Stanley.
- Ask for me.
- Okay, I'll do that.
- Thanks.
- Bye-bye.
- I-I'll see you next time.
- I hope it's not in a million years.
B-Bye-bye.
[Biderman] Excuse me.
Carl, Carl!
Here.
You can use these cheques.
They're temporary.
- Thank you, Edward.
- Like our relationship.
- Sucker!
- Give me that!
- [Laughing]
- Give it to me!
Butch, give it to me!
- Preston, come on!
- Butch!
- Give it back!
Whoa!
- If you can catch me!
Come on, Butch!
[Control Panel Dings, Engine Revs]
[Preston Screams]
- [Screaming] - [Tyres Screeching]
Perfect.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
L...
I...
- Huh?
- [Butch] I saw the whole thing.
- I can be a witness if the price is decent.
- Get outta here.
He's perfectly all right, aren't you?
Aren't you?
- Yes.
- Good.
Get that thing out from underneath my car.
What about my bike?
- Kid, was I the one that parked there...
- Oh, my word!
- Are you all right?
- He's fine.
It was just a little accident.
He's okay.
- I think this guy's been drinking vodka.
- I have not been drink...
[Laughs] I don't drink at all.
Seriously, seriously.
Kid, talk to me.
How much you want for the bike?
- A thousand bucks.
- I'm not talking to you!
Bye, kid.
Go on.
Walk away.
What do you want, kid?
Name a figure, we'll discuss it.
Give this to your dad.
He'll know what to do with it.
I gotta go.
[Tyres Screeching]
[Tyre Squeaking]
Oh, man.
I thought we understood about taking care of our valuables.
Valuable?
It was a piece of junk.
If that's how you feel about a gift from your parents,
I don't see giving you a new one for your birthday.
I don't want a new bike.
I want my own room.
I'm warning you.
You're on thin ice as it is about the bike.
You know what I want?
What I want is my own house.
My rules, my money.
Listen, young man, until further notice, you're grounded.
What'd I do wrong?
[Sighs] Fred.
Hmm.
It's a blank cheque.
"[Computer Start-Up Tone]
Preston Waters.
Two hundred.
Hmm.
A thousand.
Hmm.
One million dollars.
Cash.
Whoa!
One million dollars.
[Electronic Zooming]
Hey, sonny.
Cashin' a big one today?
Uh, sort of.
Yoo-hoo.
Over here, young man.
- Well?
- I-I-I'd like to... cash this cheque, please.
Oh, a comedian.
[Laughing]
- N-No, ma'am.
- Okay, then we better take it to Mr Biderman.
Come on!
- [Ticking] - [Door Opening]
Excuse me, Mr Biderman.
We have a little problem here.
What is it, Mrs Udowitz?
- Someone thinks this is some kind of game.
- What?
Let me see that.
I see.
Is there much of a line out there, Mrs Udowitz?
- Yes, we're swamped.
- Then what are you doing here?
Please.
[Door Closes]
- Juice?
- No, thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Not thirsty.
Mr Quigley give you this cheque?
He did.
He did.
How did you run into Mr Quigley?
I didn't.
He ran into me.
Aha.
[Snickering]
[Laughing] Brilliant.
Brilliant!
- [Groans]
- I suppose you want big bills.
Actually, regular size would be okay.
Regular.
Hmm.
That's cute.
Put your backpack on the table.
Hey, hey.
I assume you know what to do with this.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
Next!
Look here, sweetheart.
Mmm, you're lookin' kind of good there.
You got your pearls and everything on.
Hate for something to have to happen to 'em.
Look here, my name is Juice... and I got something right here, and I wondered... if you'd be so kind enough as to cash it for me.
What do you want?
A million bucks?
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.
[Sighs] Go see Biderman.
Mm-mm.
Oh, my goodness gracious.
Here we go.
Here we go.
You tell Mr Quigley that he hasn't lost his touch.
- Uh-huh.
- All right.
You can go now.
Hey, kid!
- Stay away from the racetrack.
- Yes, sir.
Good one, man.
Looking good.
Mmm.
Oh!
Excuse me, sweetie.
[Gasps]
- What's wrong with you, little boy?
- [Preston] I'm sorry.
Don't be messin' up a view as good as all that.
- I-I'm sorry.
- What you doin' out of school anyway, huh?
You know you oughta be in school.
Go on and get up outta here before I start to get upset.
Hurry up.
How, uh...
How may I help you, sir?
I'm big Juice, man.
Quigley sent me.
Everything is fine.
- Not to worry.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah!
- The Eagle has landed.
- Hmm?
The horse is in the barn.
The chicken...
is in the pot.
Look here, man, I don't know nothin' about no eagles landing' and all of that.
I don't know nothin' about no horse running' through the barn.
And I certainly don't know nothin' about no... chickens bein' in the pot.
You understand?
But if you do me a favour... as to be so kind as to cash this cheque right there,
- I could be on my way.
- Wait.
- Quigley sent you?
- That's right.
- What about the kid?
- What kid?
Man...
The kid!
The kid with the backpack!
Look here, man.
I'm tired of tellin' you this.
But if you don't give me the money for that cheque,
I guarantee there's a bullet with your name on it in this chamber.
[Moaning] The kid with the backpack.
The kid with the backpack!
The backpack!
The backpack!
Shit!
Oh, my god!
[Quigley] 150 grand, cash.
- It's my last offer, guys.
- [Woman] You're our Realtor.
You tell us.
This offer is so much less than our asking price.
Well, Mrs Appleton, it really is a buyer's market.
Do you mind if we take a minute to think about it?
Listen, I got all the time in the world, sweetheart.
Too bad I can't say the same for you two.
Applesauce, what's with the long face, my man?
I bought your pad.
You've got some cash.
It's a beautiful thing.
Su casa is soon to be mi casa.
You know what I'm saying?
- Groovin' thing, man.
- Yeah, well...
[Dial Tone]
- " [Start-Up Tone] - [Sighs]
[Phone Ringing]
- Hello.
- [Computer] Good afternoon.
...your house.
- [Computer Beeps]
I'd like to make a cash offer on your house.
Someone else wants to make an offer.
What?
On this dump?
- Uh, hello, sir.
Can you hear me?
- Who is this yo-yo?
[Typing]
- [Computer] One-sixty.
- What kind of hustle is this?
And what's with your voice, pal?
Sore throat-itis.
[Computer Coughs]
Yeah.
I'll tell you what.
One-seventy right now, cash, and I walk away.
- You take it or leave it right now.
- Ask the box.
One-eighty, plus closing costs.
- One-eighty, - [Preston] Top that, sucker.
Plus closing costs.
- One-ninety, darlin'.
Top that.
- Preston, honey?
I have a few errands to run.
I'll be back by 2:00.
Okay.
Bye, Mom.
- [Computer] Two hundred.
- Two-ten.
- Just to be safe, make that 3:00.
- [Laughs]
- Three hundred?
- Ma, you're killin' me on this deal.
Come on.
Are you tellin' me we're gonna sit here and listen... to some talking box with a robot voice?
What is this?
Uh, 300 it is.
Are you prepared to top 300?
No, I don't think I'm prepared to top 300!
Are you out of your mind?
We had a deal here!
Are you Realtors just a bunch of crooks?
Is that it?
What's going on with you people?
Well, I am sorry you feel that way, but I have an offer on the table of 300.
- [Computer] Thousand.
- Uh, we'll take it.
- Sold.
- Yeah.
You probably won't live to enjoy the cash.
[Realtor] Just one thing, sir.
What is your name?
My name is Preston...
Bingo.
Macintosh.
My name is Macintosh.
Well, congratulations, Mr Macintosh.
- You have a house.
- Yes!
I'm rich!
Yeah!
Whoo, yes!
Yeah!
Money!
Money!
- You did what with my money?
- [Juice] You're not gonna believe this.
He gave all your money to a little old bitty boy.
That was my nest egg.
That's all I had to start a new life.
I worked hard to steal that money, Biderman!
You gave it to some zit-faced little kid?
Now wait a minute.
I seen the kid.
- His skin looked pretty smooth.
- The boy had a cheque signed by you.
I didn't write a cheque to anybody except for this genius here.
Now hold on a minute.
I'm not the one who cashed a cheque for a million dollars.
- That was this man right here.
- Had your signature.
I said I didn't write it!
You gave me the cheque-book,
I put it in my pocket, I got in my car, I... I...
I can't feel my legs.
Uh, I...
Oh, oh, oh.
Calm down.
I've got a surveillance photo of the boy.
[Stammering] We'll find him in no time.
- Oh, yeah, that's him.
- I can't see a thing.
I recognize him.
I'd know him anywhere.
It's upside-down.
All right.
So where are you gonna find the kid, Mr Family Man?
- Newspapers.
- You want me to advertise, is that it?
No, no, no.
They have listings.
Uh, family activities where, where...
You know, things where kids go.
See?
Fine.
You're gonna help me find him.
- You understand?
Dead or alive.
- Uh-huh.
Let's get out of here.
- Oh, don't think you ain't comin' with us.
- [Gasping]
Somebody's in there with Biderman now.
A couple of guys I've never seen before.
They've just left.
The money laundering is definitely on again.
We've got to notify the Bureau right away.
[Man] Hello, Limousines Unlimited.
- You have the car keys?
- No, you have the car keys.
- Oh, yeah.
You make sure you-know-who stays grounded.
- And he goes to bed early.
- You got it, Pops.
- Don't call me that.
Uh, excuse me.
Sorry, kid.
Nobody famous inside.
Do you want to take your mitts off the car, please?
- I'm waitin' for a client here.
- But I'm your client.
Oh, right, yeah.
And I'm Madonna.
Sorry, kid.
The boss doesn't like me taking baseball cards as payment.
So if you want to ride in this, you need some buckaroos, buckarinis, some moola, some dinero, some money, some frogskins, much similar to the money you've given me...
In fact, identical to the money you've given me right now.
I was just kiddin' about bein' Madonna.
- My name's Henry.
- Hi, Henry.
I'm Preston.
- Preston, good to see ya.
- Preston Waters.
Yes, nice to meet ya.
Hop in.
Go ahead.
I didn't actually mean hop in, but...
So, where to, boss?
- Well, Harry, we're gonna go buy some stuff.
- Yes, sir.
[Tyres Screeching]
"Hey, yeah"
"Ow, whoo"
"The best things in life are free"
"But you can keep them for the birds and bees"
- "Now give me money" - "That's what I want"
- "That's what I want, yeah" - "That's what I want"
- "That's what I want Yeah" - "That's what I want"
"That's what I want"
"Baby, your lovin' gives me a thrill"
"But your lovin' never paid my bills"
- "Now give me money" - "That's what I want"
- "That's what I want" - "That's what I want"

- "That's what I want" - "Ow, hey"
- Ice cream!
Turn around, Henry.
- Oh, right on.
"I need some money, baby I need some money"
"I just need a few"
- Hey, thanks a lot for the great watch.
- You're welcome.
- Hey, this guy, uh...
What is it?
Mclntyre?
- Macintosh.
Uh, Macintosh.
Yeah, yeah.
If you don't mind me askin', where does he get his money?
Well, he doesn't get it, he just has it.
Why does he get a kid like you to go out and buy all this stuff for him?
He...
He never had a real childhood.
So now that he's really, really rich, he can have all the fun that he couldn't have when he was a kid.
- Oh.
Oh, I see.
- You know.
So he didn't have any fun when he was a kid, but now he's old and he's got money.
You're a kid having the fun for him now... that he couldn't have when he was a kid.
- Okay, sure.
- Stop!
Pull over, Henry!
It's Shay!
- Stop!
Hey!
- [Shay Screams] You scared me!
- Sorry.
- Preston, right?
- You've got a good memory.
- Thanks.
- Great, kid.
Very nice.
- Nice wheels.
Oh, this?
Ah, it's my boss, Mr Macintosh.
- Do you want a ride?
- No, thanks.
I'm outta shape.
Not from where I'm sittin' you aren't.
So, uh, I'm thinkin' about comin' into the bank tomorrow...
- and opening my account.
- Wow, you got the $200 already?
- Just about.
- All right.
Well, see you tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Was that him?
Was that Biderman?
- No, some kid who came into the bank today.
- Nice wheels for a kid.
Yeah.
Says it belongs to his boss, a guy named Macintosh.
Macintosh.
When are we gonna see Biderman?
[Man] It looks like a circus.
Hey.
Hey, hey, move it.
I've got work to do too, you know.
Where am I supposed to go?
You see an opening?
Huh?
Hey, what's the holdup here?
- Yeah, same to you, buddy.
- Hey, move it!
What is all this?
What a mess.
This is absolute madness!
Yo, who's in charge here?
[Preston Over Speaker] You with the race car, put it in the backyard.
Uh, the water slide goes back by the pool.
You guys with the TVs, put them in the living room.
Hey, you with the Cadillac, out by the pool.
You in the green jumpsuits, bring that around the back.
- Preston?
- Hi, Dad.
- What's going on here?
- Movin' in.
- Who is moving in?
- Macintosh.
- Who's Macintosh?
- I'll be right with you, Dad.
Come on, boys.
I don't have all day.
Okay, Mr Waters, the security system is all in place.
Excuse me.
This is the remote.
Here are the instructions.
All right?
We appreciate Mr Macintosh's business.
Here you go, pal.
What's with all the security?
Mr Macintosh says you can never be too paranoid, Dad.
- Well, who is Macintosh?
- I work for him.
He's paying me.
Yeah, but who is he?
I never met him.
- You mean you haven't met him?
- No, I haven't met him.
- He's heard about you.
- Really?
Yeah, about work and stuff.
Really good things.
- Well...
His stuff is blocking our driveway.
- Dad.
Boys!
Could you clear a path, please?
Get a move on it!
All set, Dad.
"I knew a guy who was tough but sweet"
[Henry] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
"He's the one He can't be beat"
"He's got everything that I desire"
- "Sets the summer sun on fire"
- Brake, brake!
"I want candy"
- "I want candy"
- Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip!
- "Yeah" - [Game] Body blow.
Uppercut.
- Body blow.
Left hook.
Uppercut.
Body blow.
- Ow.
- Uppercut.
- Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
Body blow.
Ten, nine...
- "I want candy"
- Yeah!
Yes!
"I want candy"
"Go to see him when the sun goes down"
- Come on, Henry!
Come on!
- "Ain't no finer boy in town"
- Hey!
Whoa!
- "I want candy"
- Oh, Henry!
- "I want candy"
- The blood rushed to my head.
- "Hey"
"Hey"
"Hey"
"Hey, hey"
[Woman] Is something wrong?
No.
I was wondering who could spend cash like that these days.
Oh, yeah.
The man's name is Macintosh.
- Macintosh?
- Mm-hmm.
He just moved here.
- Apparently loaded.
- Apparently.
I don't feel good about being here.
People may get the wrong idea.
Really?
You don't feel good?
How do you think I felt when you gave away my million dollars, huh?
Juice.
See anybody that looks like him?
Oh, yeah.
He looks like him.
Uh, she looks like him right there.
Way back over there, uh, there goes his little twin brother.
You give me one picture and expect me to find him out of all these kids?
You must be crazy.
I'm gonna get on the water slide.
I'm startin' to sweat.
Hey, mister, you know where the refreshment stands are?
- [Pops Balloon]
- No.
[Girl Crying]
Boom, boom, boom!
I got you!
Boom, boom, boom, boom!
[Electronic Gunfire]
- [Butch Whimpering]
- He says he knows you, boss.
Oh, well, just throw him out.
[Screaming] Ow!
Ow!
- Banzai!
- "I want candy"
- [Preston Screaming] - "I want candy"
"Hey"
"Hey"
- "Hey"
- Hiya.
I didn't expect to see you here.
- Oh, what you doin' here?
- I came by to see Mr Macintosh.
- Oh, no, he's in a meeting.
- That's okay, I'll wait.
I just really need to see him.
- He's in meetings all day.
- All day?
- Swamped.
- Hey, I missed you at the bank.
I thought you were gonna come by and see me about opening up an account.
- Oh, I had to work.
- Wow.
This is where you work?
- Not too shabby.
- Comfortable.
- I brought an application.
- Do you still want to open up an account with me?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Do you have your deposit?
- I'll go get it.
Okay.
Great.
[Preston Screaming]
- Whoa!
- That's amazing!
Sorry, just printed it.
Two hundred dollars.
Looks like you fell into some money, huh?
- I make a living.
- Yeah, well, I guess Mr Macintosh...
He knows a good man when he sees one.
- Will he be opening up an account with us?
- Uh, maybe.
Yeah?
Great.
You know, I'd love to meet him.
How's tonight?
- Uh, tonight.
What's tonight?
- Tonight's Wednesday.
Wednesday.
Wednesday.
I'm sorry, he's busy.
- Too bad.
- Uh, but I'm not.
Oh, I handle all his financial affairs.
- You do?
- Not all of them, but I can tell you a lot about him, sort of like a pre-meeting.
- And he wouldn't mind?
- Hasn't complained yet.
Okay.
I'll come by around 8:00.
Okay.
Wait, I could send a car for you.
Okay.
Cool.
It's a date then.
Bye-bye.
A date?
A date?
I've never been on a date.
You know what they call me downtown?
The Babe-Meister.
Think about it.
Okay, I'm gonna tell you about the real deal on dating, which I know.
First of all, women love a great body.
They love...
Look at this bod.
- Whoa.
See?
- Yeah, yeah.
Of course, you've got a bod now that's of a Greek god.
Really.
Think about it.
Women like you to have a good bod because they want to feel they're protected.
You might have to fight some guy, you know?
But not with those arms.
You don't want to hit a guy with those arms 'cause those pythons would take a guy's head off.
Seriously.
You're buff, but we're gonna get you chiseled.
Okay?
Oh, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm having a vision here of a date.
- The perfect date for you guys.
- Uh, Steak Heaven!
Ho, ho!
My little friend, you really have the hots for this one, huh?
You know, if you really want to go upscale, that all-you-can-eat salad bar...
women love that.
And take some with you.
You know, line your pockets with plastic bags.
Put the food in there. 'Cause it doesn't say "All you can eat here."
Does it say "here" on the sign?
I don't think so.
So you take something back for later.
A little snackaroo.
Oh, women love that.
You get home and you got a pocketful of hot wings.
There's nothing more that impresses a woman.
Get yourself some flowers.
Get yourself a great body, some nice hair, some good clothes, a car, and learn to say words like "noncommittal."
You are a date and a half, pal.
"There he is Some Tiny Tim"
"There he is Six foot and risin'"
"Ooh, there he is He's a knockout machine"
- "He's number one He's double cool"
- Yeah!
"He's the naked truth in magazines"
- "I believe in him" - "Wonderman"
- "He is a Mr Wonderman" - "Wonderman"
"He is a Mr Wonderman"
"Ah, yes"
- "Wonderman"
- Ew.
- "Wonderman"
- One more!
Yes, yes, yes!
Ah!
[Preston] Hey, I'm gonna get you!
[Henry] You are little sushi man.
Sushi man down.
Big boy throw.
Then they chase around.
Come around other way, fall down.
Splat.
- [Preston Screaming] - " Here comes the wonderman He'd like to say bye-bye"
- Why are you dressed like a game show host?
- I'm going out tonight.
Just a minute, young man.
You're still grounded.
- But it's for Mr Macintosh.
- I don't care.
Macintosh may have a pile of money, but he doesn't decide... when my son is or isn't grounded.
- But it's for my job.
- Your job is to be grounded.
- [Both] Grounded.
- So much for Plan 442.
What do you know about Plan 442?
Well, it's the investment plan you've been working on, your "prespectus."
Prospectus.
What are you doing going through my work?
Well, I didn't want to say it, but I told Mr Macintosh... about your Plan 442, and he was very, very interested.
Yep, I promised him I'd bring a copy of it tonight and show it to him.
But I didn't want to tell you just in case you got your hopes all up and...
No, no, no, no, no, of course not.
Let me get you a fresh copy of the "prespectus."
- I'll get a copy of it, sweetheart.
- Prospectus.
Yeah.
- Here.
You're welcome.
- Oh, thank you.
Hurry up.
Go.
Go!
You want the car keys?
Nah, that's okay, Dad.
I don't drive yet.
- [Dad] You want me to drive you?
- [Preston] No, it's okay.
You know, I still haven't met Macintosh.
Maybe I should go over and...
- No!
You'll ruin everything.
- Why not?
He has a date tonight and he's very nervous about it.
- I guess I can see him first thing in the morning.
- Oh, I don't know, Dad.
I mean, he might be up pretty late with this woman.
[Chuckles] Lucky dog.
Later, toads.
- [Groaning]
- Thank you.
That's enough.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
I can't believe Mr Macintosh went to all this trouble.
- This place is great.
- Mr Macintosh has been eating here for years.
Oh, yeah?
I thought he just moved here.
There was a Tangerino where I used to live.
Oh.
[Gargling]
Compliments of the chef for Mr Waters... and his lovely guest.
Th-They look like lobsters, only weenie.
Oh.
Mr Macintosh wanted you to have this too.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, wow.
This is beautiful.
Oh.
But I can't accept this from you.
But it's from Mr Macintosh.
- Why?
- Just a little business gift.
I mean, it's deductible, isn't it?
I'm not really sure, but it's way too expensive.
Mr Macintosh has a million dollars.
A million dollars doesn't buy all that much these days.
Do you think he should have asked for more?
What exactly does he do anyway?
Oh, a little of this, a little of that.
- You know.
- No, I'm afraid I don't.
- Oh, well...
- Is he an entrepreneur?
No, he's American.
Very secretive.
He has some questions for you too.
Okay.
Shoot.
- "Are you married?"
- No.
"What's the shortest guy you ever dated?"
Mmm.
I'm not really sure.
- "The youngest?"
- You know, these are pretty personal questions.
Well, Mr Macintosh is very interested in you.
- He is?
- He's, uh, never met anybody like you before.
He's never met me before, period.
Technically no, but he's been thinking a lot about you lately.
- He has?
- Yep.
Whoa!
Preston!
Are you okay?
- [Screaming] - [Gasps]
Do you like hamburgers?
I love hamburgers.
Never saw this kid before in my life.
This is a waste of time.
Come on.
What's so special about this place?
- You'll see.
- Mmm, come on.
Tell me.
- Okay.
- You gonna tell me?
- Come with me.
- All right.
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.
- See what?
- Okay, get in the middle.
- Okay, ready?
Five, four, three,
- Here?
Two, one.
[Shay Laughing] Holy smokes!
Okay!
Okay, now, come here, Shay!
- Okay, okay, now!
- Preston, I don't believe this!
Okay, now, let's run around!
- Don't get wet!
- Get us out!
Run!
[Screams]
- Okay, okay, okay!
- Watch out!
- No, we're gonna get soaked!
- No, no, no.
Now come...
Come around here!
Come around here!
Come on!
- Okay, hold onto me.
- [Screaming] Hey, where are you?
[Screaming] Yeah!
Yes!
- Whoo, yeah!
- Preston!
[Clapping, Cheering]
This is a great idea, Biderman.
Where's all the kids, huh?
Carl, it's late at night.
All the little boys and girls are tucked in bed.
What do you expect?
What I expect is when I give someone a million dollars, and I come back a day later,
I find the million dollars.
That's what I expect.
- Carl, I'm not a magician.
- You can make it disappear,
- you just can't get it back, right?
- I'm telling you...
If y'all want a kid so bad, there go one over there.
[Biderman] That's the little boy from the bank!
Shh.
Shh.
- [Preston Screams]
- Go get him!
- Oh, I'll race ya to the limo!
I'll race ya to the limo!
- What?
Okay, I'll race ya!
[Shouting]
[Screaming]
- I got the door for ya!
- Open the door.
It's freezing!
Go, Henry!
Go, Henry, go!
- [Henry] Here we go!
- [Groaning]
He got away again!
I don't believe this!
He got away again!
[Screaming]
[Shay] This was the most fun.
- I haven't done anything like this since I was a little kid.
- Me neither.
Thank you so much.
When can I see you again?
Well, I really have to spend some time with my job right now.
Well, uh, I'm having a party.
On Friday.
Can you come?
It's for Mr Macintosh.
Um, it could be for your business, sort of.
Mr Macintosh will really be there?
Uh-huh.
It's his birthday.
Okay.
Well, great.
It's a date then.
Oh, I'm getting out up here.
It was really fun.
And, uh,
- I had such a good time.
- Me too.
- Good night, Preston.
- Good night, Shay.
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.
- Good night, ma'am.
Bye now.
It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.
[Henry] So you're having a party Friday?
[Preston] Oh, yeah, it's Mr Macintosh's birthday.
Oh, I thought you said it was your birthday Friday.
Well, we're gonna have a joint party for the both of us.
Oh.
Well, it's a good thing it worked out your birthdays are around the same time.
Hey, you wanna move that horse?
Come on.
What is this, Bonanza?
Let's go!
Well, here we are.
Home at last.
- Thanks, Henry.
- My pleasure.
Hey!
Preston Waters!
- Good night.
- You know what you got, pal?
- What?
- S-T-Y-L-E.
- Style.
Good night, Henry.
- Style.
Good night.
Take it easy, man.
Good night.
Macintosh and I are having the biggest birthday party ever.
- Honey, where's Preston?
- He's working for Macintosh.
Oh.
Where's Damien and Ralph?
They're working for Macintosh too.
Oh.
- Have you met Macintosh?
- No, I thought you met him.
- No, I haven't met him.
- Well, I haven't met him either.
[Machine Humming]
Keep 'em comin'.
Mr Macintosh wants me to get plenty of practise.
[Screams] Watch where you're hittin' those!
Quit messin' around.
Macintosh is watching.
Where?
We've still never seen him.
Just get back to work.
He's watching.
- " [Loud Rock] - [Man]... coming out of the garage.
Ruining the neighbourhood.
"[Continues]
[Shooting Noises]
[Henry] Hey, Preston!
Your party planner's here again.
[Woman] Piston!
Piston!
Piston!
Turn off this contraption.
I have wonderful news.
Mr Macintosh's birthday is going to be the event of the century.
We gonna make the front page from coast to coast.
Oh, we are so lucky, lucky, lucky!
Now what kind of food does Mr Macintosh like?
- I don't know.
- And who are his friends?
- Do you have a guest list?
- Uh, I don't think so.
You know, dewdrop, I think I should meet him because...
I'm gonna need a little cash deposit.
Oh.
Uh, here.
Let me get you some cash.
Ooh, yes, you do have money, don't you?
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Careful walking around with this much money, darling.
Somebody could just rip you right off.
Now, this first $10,000 is going to be the deposit.
Now, of course, I'll get the balance at the party, and Mr Macintosh is good for it?
I am just so looking forward to meeting him.
- Who isn't?
- Waiters, security,
- guest list, paparazzi...
- Oh, and Yvonne?
- Yes?
- Remember, it's Preston.
Whatever!
Hey, uh, hey, Henry.
[Grunting, Laughing] It's attack of the 50-foot chauffeur from hell!
I was just wondering if you wanted to play some video games.
Oh, man, I wish you'd have said something.
I can't.
I promised some friends I was gonna meet 'em in a while.
Oh, okay.
No problem.
I'll tell you what.
I'll drop you over at one of your friend's place... on the way over, and you can have some fun there.
Nah.
Maybe I'll go to the park.
All right.
It's up to you.
Hey, Preston,
- is my tie straight?
- Well, it looks perfect.
All right.
Later.
- Over here.
- Over here!
There it is.
That's the park up ahead.
Where did all these kids come from?
Keep driving and maybe someday I'll tell you.
- How could you hit a kid?
- I didn't hit a kid.
I ran over his bicycle.
I had a dog once that got hit by a train.
- Thanks for sharing, Juice.
- Old King Cole we called him.
- He was a merry old soul.
- It's him.
- Boy with the backpack.
- Go!
Go!
Go!
- The sign says "No Cars Allowed"!
- Just drive!
Quigley!
- You're gonna pay for this!
- Just drive!
- Carl, this isn't a good idea.
- Shut up!
Whoa!
Let go, man.
What's goin' on?
- Oooh!
- Oooh!
- I'm gonna get him.
- We're gonna tear him up!
- Reach over there and get him!
- Your butt is mine, kid!
I've been wantin' this little punk.
I own you!
I own you, kid!
Come here!
He's got my money!
Aaaah!
- Follow him on foot!
Go!
- Follow him on foot?
- Do I look like a bloodhound, a professional tracker?
- Juicy, listen.
If we don't get that kid, nobody gets paid.
[Groaning]
- I want cash benefits, dental, everything.
- Not a problem.
Insurance!
Here, kiddie, kiddie!
Oh, there you go.
Come here, boy.
I'm gonna get you now.
I've been lookin' for you!
Huh?
Oh, no.
There he goes.
Yes.
Come here, boy!
I'm gonna get you now!
Aaaah!
Don't believe this!
Kill that kid when I find him.
I'm not gettin' paid for this.
- Where are we going now?
My hands are over my eyes.
- Shut up!
- Get out...
- [Screaming]
There he is!
Stick with it!
I got ya!
[Juice] I'll get you!
Hang on, hang on.
- Okay, there he is!
- Come here!
Come here!
- Juice!
Run after him.
- You must be crazy.
You run after him.
- Just ran through this whole entire park.
- Fine, get in the car.
- [Coughing]
- Don't blow chunks in my car.
I just had it detailed.
- I'm cool!
- Are you sure?
Are you sure?
- I'm not gonna mess up your priceless detail.
- Come on.
- [Retching]
- Hey!
[Boy] Wow, what's this?
- Let's go!
- After him!
- Hey, dude!
- [Juice] Move outta the way.
Sorry!
- Get 'im!
- Your butt is mine!
I want this kid...
What are you doing?
- Yeah!
- No!
Carl, watch out!
[Juice] Oh, no!
Whoa!
- Aah!
No!
- Oh, man!
Yes!
Now that's a display of fine driving right there.
You know, Carl, it might be easier just to steal another million dollars.
Hello, Mr Jackson.
Well, well, well, if it isn't the world's youngest personal injury attorney.
You know, you're in a lot of trouble today, little man.
Yeah, 'cause today I have been drinking vodka.
- Take a hike, butt-brain.
- What?
- Take a...
- Never mind, never mind.
Never mind, never mind!
[Chattering]
[Yvonne] Antoine, get that truck thing off the stage.
Thank you!
Get those golden gloves off!
Thank you!
Love, love, love, love!
What do you think?
Ta-da!
Is this to die, or what?
Uh, yeah, sure, it's, uh, to die.
I can't wait to show it to Mr Macintosh.
Come on, honey, let's see what they did with that...
"Is it to die for or what?" [Laughing]
Where did you find her?
Oh, man.
- What does this cost?
- I don't know.
- What do you think it should cost?
- Lots, lots.
Kid, why don't you just tell me what I need to know.
I'm a good guy.
Okay, how good are you going to be to me?
In round numbers.
I don't think you get the picture, sonny.
- Maybe you need a better view.
- [Screaming]
[Screaming] Preston Waters, 1508 Oak Street, Hillsdale, Indiana!
- Thank you.
- [Crying]
- You all right?
- Aaah!
Aaah!
- Is something wrong?
- No, not at all.
- Is Mr Macintosh around?
- Uh, no.
- But he will be here tonight?
- Yeah.
- In person?
- In person.
- Okay.
I'll see you tonight?
- Okay.
Okay.
You're looking good.
Bye.
- I'll be calling.
- What a babe.
Baby brother comes into his own.
For a little weasel, he sure knows how to get a girlfriend.
- Too bad he picked a fortune hunter.
- Little love pilot... shot down in flames by a gold digger.
By a what?
Gold digger, someone who is only after money.
I know women, and that one is after Macintosh's cold, hard cash.
For your information, me and Shay already went on a date... and she had one fantastic time, boys.
Oh, yes, every second she was getting closer...
- and closer to Mr Macintosh.
- [Laughing]
- Shut up!
- Just answer me this.
Did she ever, ever just once, come by without saying,
"Meanwhile, I wonder if I could see Mr Macintosh?"
She's a gold digger, man.
She just wants Macintosh's money.
- Yeah!
Ow!
- Don't rub it.
Be a man.
- Don't rub it.
- I'll rub it if I want to.
- She wants a guy with money, not some little kid with an empty piggy bank.
- Yeah.
"Well, I'll wait by the windows I'll wait by the door"
"To make sure you don't come home"
- You ever known any gold diggers?
- Man, have I.
I hate 'em.
They're the worst.
Anybody who is your friend because you have money is not your friend at all.
You know what they say about gold?
"He who has the gold makes the rules"?
No, no, no.
"A fool and his gold are soon parted."
What does that mean?
"A fool and his gold are soon parted." Those old sayings, man,
I don't get 'em.
I don't even know really what that means.
You ever heard:
"More than one way to skin a cat"?
Who skins cats?
Why would you skin a cat?
And there is not more than one way to skin a cat.
There is only one way.
You grab the cat, you rip the skin off the cat.
What is the number two way?
You put a hose up the cat's butt?
He gets so bloated that he skins himself?
Does he have a piece of Velcro under his butt?
No.
"Kill two birds with one stone." You heard that one?
You know anyone who has even killed one bird with one stone?
Kids try it all the time.
You can't hit a bird with a stone.
Unless you got a huge stone and they're tiny baby birds.
Then... [lmitating Crash] Beep, beep!
Dead.
[Sighing] "A fool and his gold are soon parted."
I guess it means that if you're a fool, your gold or your money is soon gone.
Once it's gone, it is outta there.
It is history.
It is dust.
It is vapour.
It is no more.
You are living in Brokesville.
- Unless you have Macintosh's kind of money.
- What if you don't?
I guess then you find out who your real friends are.
Man, we look good.
- Is everybody having a good time?
- [Woman Laughing]
- Good, you are.
- "Yes, we are, darling." Wow, look at the balloons.
- This is great.
Look at the ice sculpture.
- Presents!
Hey, hey, hey, kid, no touching.
Those are Mr Macintosh's.
Go find your parents.
Go on, get outta here.
Go on!
- I just want to see Mr Macintosh.
- I just want to pig out.
[Chuckling] Hey, look at that.
Excuse me.
- Sorry!
- Exactly who are you looking for, Preston?
- Have you seen Shay?
- I haven't seen her, but she'll be around.
Come on...
Oh, man, look at all this food!
Macintosh doesn't show, we bring the kid in, agreed?
If Preston says Macintosh is gonna be there, Macintosh will be there.
But you don't make a move, until I give you the signal, understood?
We got eight men ready to go in and nail him the second he shows up!
We close this deal tonight!
Where's the pizza and the ice cream?
What's going on here?
This could have been a pizza before it got run over by a couple of trucks.
Oh, that looks tasty.
Looks like something you'd find between your toes.
Ah, ah, ah!
It's sucking the life outta me!
- Shut up!
Everybody's looking.
- So what?
Who cares?
Relax, have a good time.
She'll show up.
Oh, there's Shay now.
Ha!
Just kidding.
I was kidding ya!
Would you just relax?
She'll be here.
It's not at all what you thought it'd be like?
Hate being rich, huh?
Preston?
Preston?
Ice cream, ice cream.
Yoo-hoo, Preston!
Now, where is our mystery man?
It's time for Mr Macintosh to make his appearance.
I like to give my employers their bills directly.
That way if they have any questions or heart attacks or something...
- I'll give it to him.
- Fine.
Be quick about it.
$100,000?
Sweetheart, I know this seems like a whole lot of money to normal people like me and you, but to a man like Macintosh this is just pennies.
- Now, you get up there and get me my money!
- Ow!
I'll get your money.
[Computer Beeping]
Party: $100,000.
Not a problem.
You can leave it.
This is fine.
I'll be right back.
Thank you.
[Computer] Transaction not possible.
Insufficient funds.
Current balance: $332.17.
- Transaction not possible.
- Three hundred dollars?
- Insufficient funds.
Transaction not possible.
- Oh, no!
- No, please, God.
- Insufficient funds.
This can't be right.
One, two, three, four...
[Chattering]
It's gone.
It's all gone.
[Knocking]
Mr Macintosh?
Oh, sorry to bother you.
It's Fred Waters, Preston's dad.
I know you got a bash going on here, so I'll make it brief.
But, uh,
I wanted to ask you a favour.
You see, today is Preston's birthday and if you see him, if you could send him home a little early.
Lately he's been working so hard.
All of a sudden money's become so important to him.
I guess that's mostly my fault.
You don't have kids, do you, Mr Macintosh?
I'll tell you, it's very easy to make mistakes with them.
I haven't always paid enough attention to my kids.
I pushed them too hard... maybe.
Especially Preston.
I guess I expect more from him.
He reminds me of myself at that age.
I couldn't wait to grow up.
I'm afraid he's missing out on his childhood.
So am I.
Well, thanks.
I won't take up any more of your time.
And we appreciate you sending Preston home early.
If...
If he wants to come, that is.
- [Whispering] I want to come home.
- Thanks.
Dad.
Dad?
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad, wait!
Daddy!
Henry?
Henry!
Wait a minute, where's Henry?
Your driver?
He left a little while ago.
H-He left?
You sure it was Henry?
Big guy, white limo.
He's gone.
Thanks.
Now I know who my friends are.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
- [Door Opening] - [Shay] Preston?
Mr Macintosh?
- Mr Macintosh?
- It's just me.
- Which one of us did you want?
- I was looking for you.
- Oh, good.
- And Mr Macintosh.
Look, it's very, very important that I find Mr Macintosh right now.
- Do you understand?
- He's nowhere.
- He's gone.
I think you'd better leave too.
- Preston...
- you could be in danger.
- Just go, okay?
You got your necklace.
Just take it and leave.
"Give it back There's no time to lose"
"So give it back Give it back"
Riggs?
Riggs?
Riggs?
Looks like no one's home.
- Shut up, Wienerman.
- Biderman.
- Where is he?
- I don't know, but he might be down the street... at Mr Macintosh's, that's his boss.
- Macintosh.
Come on!
- [Whimpering]
You know, I do like what they have done with this colour.
There you are, puppy-butt.
Did you get me my money?
- Uh, Macintosh has disappeared.
- What?
Now, I am warning you, Tom Thumb, don't you trifle with me.
If I don't get paid, I will sue Mr Macintosh... for every dime he is worth!
Well, be sure and tell me when you find him.
Okay, little Mr Man, this party is over!
Quiet!
Stop that playing!
Stop that music!
Quiet!
Attention!
Attention!
Everybody, this party is over!
Our host...
can't pay his bills!
- Mr Macintosh is a fraud!
- [Woman] What?
[Crowd Murmuring] Who's that kid?
She's right.
Hate to tell you this, but there's been a terrible mistake.
Nobody s-should have been invited.
Macintosh is... is gone.
And he's not coming back.
So I think you should all leave too, so go.
Go on.
Close down the bar!
Come on, let's get outta here.
Come on, Antoine.
Move it!
Come on, move it!
Come back with those glasses!
Give me that!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
[Knocking]
Henry?
Henry!
I knew you'd come back!
Henry...
[Gasping]
Happy birthday.
I'm here to blow out your candles.
- Oh!
Let me go!
- What's your hurry, kid?
Got a big cheque to cash?
- Let me go!
- I like this pad.
What do you think, Juice?
Oh, yeah, I like the pad.
It looks real nice.
- Can you handle it?
Got the TV, drums.
- Oh, I like this.
- TV, drums.
- All kinds of toys.
- He's got a little taste, a little flavour.
- What's this thing here?
- I don't think I've seen one of those before.
- How do you work this?
Well, you turn the knob...
You really shouldn't let him in such a nice house as this.
All your stuff could get broken.
Kid, where's Macintosh?
N-Nowhere.
He's nowhere.
I'm going to ask you one more time.
Where is he?
Huh!
There is no Macintosh.
- I made him up.
It was me the whole time.
- Don't give me that.
- Who bought this house?
- I-I did.
You?
You outbid me?
Wait a minute.
You tryin' to tell me that this little boy here... outbid you with your own money?
Be a fly on the wall, okay, Juice?
Listen, kid, you know it's illegal to take things that don't belong to you.
I know.
I feel awful.
Take me to the police.
- Carl, don't do it.
It's a trick.
- Get outta here.
Son, I don't want to take you to the police.
Just tell me, okay?
Where's my money?
I-I spent it.
- All of it?
- All of it.
How could you spend... a million dollars in six days?
You must not have been shopping lately.
Carl, Carl, wait a minute.
Maybe we're thinking about this Macintosh thing in the wrong way.
- What are you talking about?
- You needed a new house, a new identity.
This kid, he's done it for you.
I mean, Macintosh could run for mayor here.
Yeah, I kind of like the idea of that...
Mayor Quigley.
No, no, Mayor Macintosh.
I like it.
Look, there's only one problem with that.
The...
Aaah!
- Hey!
- Come back here!
- Wait for me!
I'm coming!
- He's upstairs, man!
Break it down!
Break it down!
There he is!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
- He went down there!
- Juice, go after him!
- I ain't goin' down there.
- Go on!
Now!
- You're crazy.
I ain't goin' down there.
- Watch your head.
- What is it, about 230...
Whoa!
- Aaah!
- I'm not goin' in there.
- Oh, no, he didn't.
- Did you see him?
- Oh, no, you did just push me in the pool!
- Get out, we gotta find him!
What?
What happened?
Act like you got a purpose in life.
Go.
[Biderman] I think I'm experiencing chest pains.
[Indistinct Noise]
Carl?
Juice?
Huh?
Oh.
Little boy?
Little boy from the bank?
Ha, ha.
Oh!
[Groaning, Grunting]
Where am I?
Oh-oh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
[Sheep Bleating, Cow Mooing]
[Muttering]
[Rooster Crowing]
- Hey, hey!
- [Cow Mooing]
Got ya!
Uh-huh!
- Hey!
- Got him.
It's time for a little batting practise.
Here we go!
Hey!
What's happening?
Whoa!
Hey!
Just outside.
Let's try a sinker.
A sinker!
Another!
Another!
Let's try a screwball!
- Turn, turn, turn!
- Be cool!
Ow!
Hey!
Ho!
Come on, boy!
Screwball!
Boom!
Whoa!
Oooh!
- That must have hurt!
- My god!
Fastball, fastball!
Just inside!
- Oooh!
Ow!
- What's next, Juice?
How about tennis?
It's over, kid.
Ow!
Ow!
Preston, come out, come out, wherever you are.
None of this would have happened, you know, if you hadn't been a bad boy!
Tell me something, did you think you were going to get away with it?
Spending somebody else's hard-earned money?
Huh!
We need to have a chat.
Preston...
I'm not mad any more.
I know you're sorry.
Come on, buddy.
Pres?
Come on out now!
Banzai!
Quigley, I'll be back in a minute.
Don't leave me here...
Oh, where am I goin'?
- Whoa!
Kid!
- Don't you move.
Juice!
Biderman!
Get your useless butt over here!
[Motor Revving, Tyres Screeching]
Whoa!
Oh!
Oh!
Kid!
Kid!
What are you doin'?
Oh!
Oh!
Kid, kid, stop, please, please!
Stop!
Oh!
[Groaning]
Kid, please!
Don't do that!
Ooooh!
[Screaming]
Quigley?
Are you okay?
Aaah!
I got you now!
Come get him!
I got him now.
Come get him, you guys.
All right, hold him.
- Baseballs!
- You're not a very nice boy, you know that?
- Freeze!
- Preston, are you okay?
What's this all about?
What's happening here?
Stanley?
What are you doing here?
- Let go!
- As of this moment, you're fired from my bank!
F.B.I., Biderman.
From this moment, you're fired from your bank.
- What?
- You're with the F.B.I.?
- Yes, Preston, I am.
- Okay, kid, finally, at long last, who's Macintosh?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...
- I'm Macintosh.
- You're Macintosh?
I'm Macintosh!
And I want you all off my property now!
- He's Macintosh.
- You sure?
I tell ya, I'm Macintosh!
Please tell these guys I'm Macintosh.
- Oh, he's Macintosh.
Don't you know Papa Macintosh?
- Mr Macintosh.
And Big Mama Macintosh be hangin' out with the brothers.
Mr Macintosh, you're under arrest for fraud, money laundering and grand theft.
- What are you talking about?
- Bring in Biderman too.
- I'm a banker!
- And take Mr Wise Guy too.
- Who?
Me?
I'm not wise.
- Get your hands off me.
- Man, I flunked recess.
- Take it easy, man.
- Take 'em out.
- I'm not even from here, man.
- I'm a banker.
- I was roaming down the street.
Cat said, Hey, there's a party.
- I own a bank!
Sir, stay behind the line there.
Everyone, just calm down, okay?
Honey, I'm gonna check this out, make sure that Preston's okay.
- You take the boys home.
- [Chattering]
- What's going on?
- Something to do with Macintosh.
The F.B.I. Is all over.
- Uh, have you seen my son, a little boy?
- He's inside with the F.B.I.
- Excuse me, excuse me, please.
Officer...
- Whoa, whoa!
- Nobody gets in there without a badge, sir.
- I'm looking for my son.
Kind of neat.
Can I see your badge?
Shay Stanley, F.B.I.
Cool.
Wait a minute.
So that means our date... was just for your...
just for your job?
Well, it started out like that.
I should have known.
Hey, you know, I wouldn't have traded that night for anything.
So when can I see you again, Shay?
Mmm, why don't you give me a call in, say, about ten years?
- Five.
- Seven.
- Six.
- Okay, it's a date.
Good night, Preston.
[Dad] Preston!
Preston?
Oh, my god, he's in shock.
Oh, oh, I'm fine, Dad.
I'm fine now.
Oh, I'm glad to see you.
- What's going on here?
- It's a long story.
- Well, why don't we go on home, you tell me all about it?
- Okay.
I want to say goodbye to a friend, okay, Dad?
Wow, this is just great.
I can't step out for a couple of seconds.
I miss all the action.
Thanks.
- Are you okay?
- I thought you left, man.
No, I didn't leave.
What did we say the party needed?
Ice cream, right?
I just went to get ice cream.
I don't know if I got the exact recipe, but I think I got it close.
- So?
- Hey, it's pretty close.
Well, I guess Macintosh is no more, huh?
It's too bad, because, uh, I really enjoyed working for him.
- I had a good time too...
- Do me a favour?
Next time you see him, tell him, uh, that I'm really gonna miss him.
I'll miss you too, Henry.
You're gonna do just fine.
See ya.
- Hey, Henry.
- Huh?
- Know what you have?
- What?
- S-T-Y-L-E, style.
- Style.
Hey, Preston, you're not gonna finish this ice cream, I guess, huh?
Well, no sense letting' this go to waste.
So, what happened?
Oh, well, uh, Macintosh wasn't...
He...
He wasn't who he thought he was.
- How do you mean?
- Well, he shouldn't have done what he did.
He shouldn't have fooled everybody.
I think you're right.
It's been a long night.
Better get on up to bed.
Yeah, I think I ought to get some sleep too, Dad.
And tomorrow, I'll tell you all about Mr Macintosh.
Sleep well, Preston.
[Group] Ta-da!
"Happy birthday to you"
"Happy birthday dear Preston"
"Happy birthday to you"
Make a wish.
You know what they say, "Be careful what you wish for."
Oh.
What else do I want?
I mean, I got everything... that I need right here.
On the other hand.
Where are you?
Oh.
Hello, beautiful.
Did you miss me?
Dad, I've given this some thought... and I've decided that since Damien and Ralph have their own rooms, well, there's no reason why they should be bringing their junk into my room.
Well, how does that sound, Helen?
- Out of the way, stick boy!
- Hand Foot is here to stay.
- Oops, kicked your baby monkey.
- Get out of here, Ralph!
- Here, take this.
- Go away, Damien.
This is my room.
Was.
Now it's also the world headquarters of Hand Foot, Incorporated.
- Hand Foot all the way!
- Hand Foot, Hand Foot, Hand Foot!
- Hand Foot?
You guys aren't gonna make a dime.
- Okay, we'll use this.
- Yeah!
- Hey, that's my life savings!
- Consider yourself our silent partner.
- Yeah, say something and you're dead.
- Yeah.
- How's the big move going?
- Great.
- Good.
Come on, Ralph.
Gotta get to work.
Dad?
Dad... well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've decided that...
- s-s-since Damien and Ralph have their own room...
- Preston, they need the space for their business.
- Not my space.
- Young man, in this family, industry gets rewarded.
While you're in here playing, your brothers are hard at work.
- Yeah, kissing' butt for money.
- Well, you know the golden rule.
- He who has the gold makes the rules.
- One day you'll have a job.
When I was your age, I had my own business cleaning wheels.
I was pulling down 100 bucks a week polishing cars.
- You used to say 75.
- Well, you gotta think big, Preston.
- Surprise.
- Whoa, check it out.
Yeah, it's for your business.
We had a spare at the office.
- Damien, the speakers are out in the hall.
- How does it work?
It imitates human intelligence, like you guys.
- Preston, maybe you could teach your brothers how to use it.
- Not possible.
The software will teach you how to do everything but make love to a woman.
- Now I know what program to get your father for Christmas.
- Mom!
- Oops!
Uh, here.
Let me help you with that.
- Preston, you're gonna be late...
- for Butch's birthday party.
- Who wants to celebrate Butch's birth?
- It's important to get out of your room more.
- Our room.
Well, good luck, guys.
Damien and Ralph sleep... butt to face, butt to face,
- butt to face,
- Huh?
- Who said that?
- Butt to face, butt to face,
- Type "Quit." Hit "Delete."
- Butt to face, butt to face, butt to face...
- Turn it off!
Pull the plug!
- Ow!
- Don't rub it.
Be a man.
- Ouch!
- Little wimp.
Come on, Preston.
You don't want to be late for Butch's birthday party.
- Are you gonna have fun today?
- How can I, Dad?
- I don't have any money.
- Now, look.
Here's a couple of bucks.
Ah, heck, you can have fun all day on that.
You don't get out much, do you, Dad?
Welcome to Fun Land.
Fun, fun, fun for everyone.
Welcome to Fun Land.
Fun, fun, fun for everyone.
- Hey.
Hey, man.
- Hey, Butch.
Hey, man.
Yeah!
Hey, what's up?
Oh, look.
It's Presto the Pesto.
Hello, Butch.
Oh!
Tokens!
- Give me 50.
It's my birthday.
- Fifty.
- Twenty-five, please.
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-seven.
- Twenty-seven.
- Six, please.
- Six.
Six.
- Coming?
- I don't know.
It's gonna be awesome!
- Yeah, let's go over here!
- This one!
- Hurry!
Hey, Preston!
Hey, over here!
- Hey, Preston, how's your ostrich?
- Watch out!
Preston has an ostrich!
Hey, Preston, come with us!
Just kidding!
Did you have fun at Butch's birthday party?
I have a question.
Are we broke?
- No, we just have to watch our spending habits.
- That's right.
Like when your mother calls her sister back East and talks for 97 minutes.
So if we're not poverty-stricken, there must be some other reason I'm so deprived.
- We're outta here!
Whoo!
- Goin' to the ball game.
- Can I go?
- We bought tickets, toad.
- Damien!
- You need some cash?
- Nah, we got a bunch of change.
- Later, Preston.
It's not fair.
Why can't I have anything?
Well, Preston, they have jobs, and they've learned to save.
How can I save money if I don't have any?
A penny saved is a penny earned.
- What do you want for your birthday?
- Money... so I can pay to have Ralph and Damien knocked off.
Anything else?
Well, maybe we'll give him one of his birthday presents early.
A gift came from Grandma today.
Hmm.
What a rip-off!
It's a check for nothing!
I'm having a bad day.
Oh, your grandma just forgot to fill in how much it was for, but she signed it at the bottom, see?
It's a blank check.
- We'll just fill in the amount.
- How much did you get last year, honey?
A thousand.
- Ten dollars.
- Wait, Dad.
What about inflation?
Oh, make it 11.
You'd be surprised how fast... eleven dollars can grow with interest.
Preston?
Preston?
Eleven dollars... at 3.45 interest.
Your account will reach... one million dollars... in 342,506 years.
I'm stuck here forever.
- Lights out up there.
- Why?
My house, my rules.
"My house, my rules."
My own house.
Dave, who needs assets?
I'm your asset.
- I'm a big asset.
Oh, c...
- I can't believe you.
Dave, Dave.
Come on, come on.
Why only borrow 150,000?
Our money is your money.
Round it off to two.
- Do I qualify?
- Of course you qualify for the loan, Dave.
We're golf partners.
- You don't look happy to see me.
- Quig...
- Quigley.
- Quigley.
That's funny.
I don't remember you stuttering on the witness stand.
- You just sang like a bird, didn't you?
- I had no choice, Carl.
- I mean, lying in court...
- You also pointed at me.
- That hurt.
- Well, I was under oath.
- I mean...
- Come here.
The only reason you're alive, Biderman, is I knew I might need you again someday...
like today.
Oh, sure.
You need a loan?
The rates are great now.
- And you get a toaster.
- I don't need a toaster.
Before I went away, I put aside a little nest egg.
These bills, they're marked consecutively.
- They'd trace these in a minute.
- That's right.
That's where you come in, old buddy.
I want new bills.
- We're back in the SL business, Biderman.
- Ah, money laundering...
- is very difficult these days, Carl.
- You still do it though, don't you?
That's a good-looking family right there.
You're not gonna hurt them, are you?
- Hate to have to.
- All right.
How do you want to do this?
- I'll send my guy in tomorrow with a check for a million.
- Tomorrow?
Yep, just like the old days.
You give him the cash, unmarked, send him on his way.
- Whom should I expect?
- Whom should...
Whom should you expect?
His name is Juice.
- Juice?
- Mmm, he'll be here in exactly 24 hours.
Let's call it 1:00.
Come on.
Walk me out.
Show a little respect.
Whoa.
I know how you feel.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Can you see okay?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, sure.
I would like to open an account, please.
Eleven dollars.
Do you have any other money you'd like to deposit, Mr Waters?
Oh, uh, I could, but it's sort of hard to save around my house; that's why I'm here.
I'm afraid we have a minimum balance.
It's $200.
Two hundred dollars?
That could take a million years.
Well, whenever you're ready, please come back and see me.
My name's Shay Stanley.
- Ask for me.
- Okay, I'll do that.
- Thanks.
- Bye-bye.
- I-I'll see you next time.
- I hope it's not in a million years.
B-Bye-bye.
Excuse me.
Carl, Carl!
Here.
You can use these checks.
They're temporary.
- Thank you, Edward.
- Like our relationship.
- Sucker!
- Give me that!
Give it to me!
Butch, give it to me!
- Preston, come on!
- Butch!
- Give it back!
Whoa!
- If you can catch me!
Come on, Butch!
Perfect.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
L...
I...
- Huh?
- I saw the whole thing.
- I can be a witness if the price is decent.
- Get outta here.
He's perfectly all right, aren't you?
Aren't you?
- Yes.
- Good.
Get that thing out from underneath my car.
What about my bike?
- Kid, was I the one that parked there...
- Oh, my word!
- Are you all right?
- He's fine.
It was just a little accident.
He's okay.
- I think this guy's been drinking vodka.
- I have not been drink...
I don't drink at all.
Seriously, seriously.
Kid, talk to me.
How much you want for the bike?
- A thousand bucks.
- I'm not talking to you!
Bye, kid.
Go on.
Walk away.
What do you want, kid?
Name a figure, we'll discuss it.
Give this to your dad.
He'll know what to do with it.
I gotta go.
Oh, man.
I thought we understood about taking care of our valuables.
Valuable?
It was a piece of junk.
If that's how you feel about a gift from your parents,
I don't see giving you a new one for your birthday.
I don't want a new bike.
I want my own room.
I'm warning you.
You're on thin ice as it is about the bike.
You know what I want?
What I want is my own house.
My rules, my money.
Listen, young man, until further notice, you're grounded.
What'd I do wrong?
Fred.
Hmm.
It's a blank check.
Preston Waters.
Two hundred.
Hmm.
A thousand.
Hmm.
One million dollars.
Cash.
Whoa!
One million dollars.
Hey, sonny.
Cashin' a big one today?
Uh, sort of.
Yoo-hoo.
Over here, young man.
- Well?
- I-I-I'd like to... cash this check, please.
Oh, a comedian.
- N-No, ma'am.
- Okay, then we better take it to Mr Biderman.
Come on!
Excuse me, Mr Biderman.
We have a little problem here.
What is it, Mrs Udowitz?
- Someone thinks this is some kind of game.
- What?
Let me see that.
I see.
Is there much of a line out there, Mrs Udowitz?
- Yes, we're swamped.
- Then what are you doing here?
Please.
- Juice?
- No, thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Not thirsty.
Mr Quigley give you this check?
He did.
How did you run into Mr Quigley?
I didn't.
He ran into me.
Aha.
Brilliant.
Brilliant!
I suppose you want big bills.
Actually, regular size would be okay.
Regular.
Hmm.
That's cute.
Put your backpack on the table.
Hey, hey.
I assume you know what to do with this.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
Next!
Look here, sweetheart.
Mmm, you're lookin' kind of good there.
You got your pearls and everything on.
Hate for something to have to happen to 'em.
Look here, my name is Juice... and I got something right here, and I wondered... if you'd be so kind enough as to cash it for me.
What do you want?
A million bucks?
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.
Go see Biderman.
Mm-mm.
Oh, my goodness gracious.
Here we go.
Here we go.
You tell Mr Quigley that he hasn't lost his touch.
- Uh-huh.
- All right.
You can go now.
Hey, kid!
- Stay away from the racetrack.
- Yes, sir.
Good one, man.
Looking good.
Mmm.
Oh!
Excuse me, sweetie.
- What's wrong with you, little boy?
- I'm sorry.
Don't be messin' up a view as good as all that.
- I-I'm sorry.
- What you doin' out of school anyway, huh?
You know you oughta be in school.
Go on and get up outta here before I start to get upset.
Hurry up.
How, uh...
How may I help you, sir?
I'm big Juice, man.
Quigley sent me.
Everything is fine.
- Not to worry.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah!
- The Eagle has landed.
- Hmm?
The horse is in the barn.
The chicken...
is in the pot.
Look here, man, I don't know nothin' about no eagles landing' and all of that.
I don't know nothin' about no horse running' through the barn.
And I certainly don't know nothin' about no... chickens bein' in the pot.
You understand?
But if you do me a favor... as to be so kind as to cash this check right there,
- I could be on my way.
- Wait.
- Quigley sent you?
- That's right.
- What about the kid?
- What kid?
Man...
The kid!
The kid with the backpack!
Look here, man.
I'm tired of tellin' you this.
But if you don't give me the money for that check,
I guarantee there's a bullet with your name on it in this chamber.
The kid with the backpack.
The kid with the backpack!
The backpack!
The backpack!
Shit!
Oh, my god!
150 grand, cash.
- It's my last offer, guys.
- You're our Realtor.
You tell us.
This offer is so much less than our asking price.
Well, Mrs Appleton, it really is a buyer's market.
Do you mind if we take a minute to think about it?
Listen, I got all the time in the world, sweetheart.
Too bad I can't say the same for you two.
Applesauce, what's with the long face, my man?
I bought your pad.
You've got some cash.
It's a beautiful thing.
Su casa is soon to be mi casa.
You know what I'm saying?
- Groovin' thing, man.
- Yeah, well...
- Hello.
- Good afternoon.
...your house.
I'd like to make a cash offer on your house.
Someone else wants to make an offer.
What?
On this dump?
- Uh, hello, sir.
Can you hear me?
- Who is this yo-yo?
- One-sixty.
- What kind of hustle is this?
And what's with your voice, pal?
Sore throat-itis.
Yeah.
I'll tell you what.
One-seventy right now, cash, and I walk away.
- You take it or leave it right now.
- Ask the box.
One-eighty, plus closing costs.
- One-eighty,
- Top that, sucker.
Plus closing costs.
- One-ninety, darlin'.
Top that.
- Preston, honey?
I have a few errands to run.
I'll be back by 2:00.
Okay.
Bye, Mom.
- Two hundred.
- Two-ten.
Just to be safe, make that 3:00.
- Three hundred?
- Ma, you're killin' me on this deal.
Come on.
Are you tellin' me we're gonna sit here and listen... to some talking box with a robot voice?
What is this?
Uh, 300 it is.
Are you prepared to top 300?
No, I don't think I'm prepared to top 300!
Are you out of your mind?
We had a deal here!
Are you Realtors just a bunch of crooks?
Is that it?
What's going on with you people?
Well, I am sorry you feel that way, but I have an offer on the table of 300.
- Thousand.
- Uh, we'll take it.
- Sold.
- Yeah.
You probably won't live to enjoy the cash.
Just one thing, sir.
What is your name?
My name is Preston...
Bingo.
Macintosh.
My name is Macintosh.
Well, congratulations, Mr Macintosh.
- You have a house.
- Yes!
I'm rich!
Yeah!
Whoo, yes!
Yeah!
Money!
Money!
- You did what with my money?
- You're not gonna believe this.
He gave all your money to a little old bitty boy.
That was my nest egg.
That's all I had to start a new life.
I worked hard to steal that money, Biderman!
You gave it to some zit-faced little kid?
Now wait a minute.
I seen the kid.
- His skin looked pretty smooth.
- The boy had a check signed by you.
I didn't write a check to anybody except for this genius here.
Now hold on a minute.
I'm not the one who cashed a check for a million dollars.
- That was this man right here.
- Had your signature.
I said I didn't write it!
You gave me the check-book,
I put it in my pocket, I got in my car, I... I...
I can't feel my legs.
Uh, I...
Oh, oh, oh.
Calm down.
I've got a surveillance photo of the boy.
We'll find him in no time.
- Oh, yeah, that's him.
- I can't see a thing.
I recognize him.
I'd know him anywhere.
It's upside-down.
All right.
So where are you gonna find the kid, Mr Family Man?
- Newspapers.
- You want me to advertise, is that it?
No, no, no.
They have listings.
Uh, family activities where, where...
You know, things where kids go.
See?
Fine.
You're gonna help me find him.
- You understand?
Dead or alive.
- Uh-huh.
Let's get out of here.
Oh, don't think you ain't comin' with us.
Somebody's in there with Biderman now.
A couple of guys I've never seen before.
They've just left.
The money laundering is definitely on again.
We've got to notify the Bureau right away.
Hello, Limousines Unlimited.
- You have the car keys?
- No, you have the car keys.
- Oh, yeah.
You make sure you-know-who stays grounded.
- And he goes to bed early.
- You got it, Pops.
- Don't call me that.
Uh, excuse me.
Sorry, kid.
Nobody famous inside.
Do you want to take your mitts off the car, please?
- I'm waitin' for a client here.
- But I'm your client.
Oh, right, yeah.
And I'm Madonna.
Sorry, kid.
The boss doesn't like me taking baseball cards as payment.
So if you want to ride in this, you need some buckaroos, buckarinis, some moola, some dinero, some money, some frogskins, much similar to the money you've given me...
In fact, identical to the money you've given me right now.
I was just kiddin' about bein' Madonna.
- My name's Henry.
- Hi, Henry.
I'm Preston.
- Preston, good to see ya.
- Preston Waters.
Yes, nice to meet ya.
Hop in.
Go ahead.
I didn't actually mean hop in, but...
So, where to, boss?
- Well, Harry, we're gonna go buy some stuff.
- Yes, sir.
"Hey, yeah"
"Ow, whoo"
"The best things in life are free"
"But you can keep them for the birds and bees"
- "Now give me money" - "That's what I want"
- "That's what I want, yeah" - "That's what I want"
- "That's what I want Yeah" - "That's what I want"
"That's what I want"
"Baby, your lovin' gives me a thrill"
"But your lovin' never paid my bills"
- "Now give me money" - "That's what I want"
- "That's what I want" - "That's what I want"
- "That's what I want" - "That's"
"What I want"
"That's what I want"
"Give it to me, baby Uh-huh"

"I want m-m-m-m-money Yeah"
"I got to have some money"
- " I want to have the money Uh-huh, hey, hey" - "Money"
"Hey, yeah"
"Money don't get everything it's true"
"What it don't get now I can't use"
- "I want m-m-m-money, hey" - "That's what I want"
- "That's what I want" - "That's what I want"
"That's what I want Hey, yeah"
- "I want some money" - "That's what I want"
- "That's what I want" - "Hey, yeah"
"That's what I want"
- "Money" - "That's what I want"
- "That's what I want" - "Ow, hey"
- Ice cream!
Turn around, Henry.
- Oh, right on.
"I need some money, baby I need some money"
"I just need a few"
- Hey, thanks a lot for the great watch.
- You're welcome.
- Hey, this guy, uh...
What is it?
McIntyre?
- Macintosh.
Uh, Macintosh.
Yeah, yeah.
If you don't mind me askin', where does he get his money?
Well, he doesn't get it, he just has it.
Why does he get a kid like you to go out and buy all this stuff for him?
He...
He never had a real childhood.
So now that he's really, really rich, he can have all the fun that he couldn't have when he was a kid.
- Oh.
Oh, I see.
- You know.
So he didn't have any fun when he was a kid, but now he's old and he's got money.
You're a kid having the fun for him now... that he couldn't have when he was a kid.
- Okay, sure.
- Stop!
Pull over, Henry!
It's Shay!
- Stop!
Hey!
- You scared me!
- Sorry.
- Preston, right?
- You've got a good memory.
- Thanks.
- Great, kid.
Very nice.
- Nice wheels.
Oh, this?
Ah, it's my boss, Mr Macintosh.
- Do you want a ride?
- No, thanks.
I'm outta shape.
Not from where I'm sittin' you aren't.
So, uh, I'm thinkin' about comin' into the bank tomorrow...
- and opening my account.
- Wow, you got the $200 already?
- Just about.
- All right.
Well, see you tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Was that him?
Was that Biderman?
- No, some kid who came into the bank today.
- Nice wheels for a kid.
Yeah.
Says it belongs to his boss, a guy named Macintosh.
Macintosh.
When are we gonna see Biderman?
It looks like a circus.
Hey.
Hey, hey, move it.
I've got work to do too, you know.
Where am I supposed to go?
You see an opening?
Huh?
Hey, what's the holdup here?
- Yeah, same to you, buddy.
- Hey, move it!
What is all this?
What a mess.
This is absolute madness!
Yo, who's in charge here?
You with the race car, put it in the backyard.
Uh, the water slide goes back by the pool.
You guys with the TVs, put them in the living room.
Hey, you with the Cadillac, out by the pool.
You in the green jumpsuits, bring that around the back.
- Preston?
- Hi, Dad.
- What's going on here?
- Movin' in.
- Who is moving in?
- Macintosh.
- Who's Macintosh?
- I'll be right with you, Dad.
Come on, boys.
I don't have all day.
Okay, Mr Waters, the security system is all in place.
Excuse me.
This is the remote.
Here are the instructions.
All right?
We appreciate Mr Macintosh's business.
Here you go, pal.
What's with all the security?
Mr Macintosh says you can never be too paranoid, Dad.
- Well, who is Macintosh?
- I work for him.
He's paying me.
Yeah, but who is he?
I never met him.
- You mean you haven't met him?
- No, I haven't met him.
- He's heard about you.
- Really?
Yeah, about work and stuff.
Really good things.
- Well...
His stuff is blocking our driveway.
- Dad.
Boys!
Could you clear a path, please?
Get a move on it!
All set, Dad.
"I knew a guy who was tough but sweet"
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
"He's the one He can't be beat"
"He's got everything that I desire"
- "Sets the summer sun on fire"
- Brake, brake!
"I want candy"
- "I want candy"
- Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip!
- "Yeah"
- Body blow.
Uppercut.
- Body blow.
Left hook.
Uppercut.
Body blow.
- Ow.
- Uppercut.
- Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
Body blow.
Ten, nine...
- "I want candy"
- Yeah!
Yes!
"I want candy"
"Go to see him when the sun goes down"
- Come on, Henry!
Come on!
- "Ain't no finer boy in town"
- Hey!
Whoa!
- "I want candy"
- Oh, Henry!
- "I want candy"
- The blood rushed to my head.
- "Hey"
"Hey"
"Hey, hey"
Is something wrong?
No.
I was wondering who could spend cash like that these days.
Oh, yeah.
The man's name is Macintosh.
- Macintosh?
- Mm-hmm.
He just moved here.
- Apparently loaded.
- Apparently.
I don't feel good about being here.
People may get the wrong idea.
Really?
You don't feel good?
How do you think I felt when you gave away my million dollars, huh?
Juice.
See anybody that looks like him?
Oh, yeah.
He looks like him.
Uh, she looks like him right there.
Way back over there, uh, there goes his little twin brother.
You give me one picture and expect me to find him out of all these kids?
You must be crazy.
I'm gonna get on the water slide.
I'm startin' to sweat.
Hey, mister, you know where the refreshment stands are?
No.
Boom, boom, boom!
I got you!
Boom, boom, boom, boom!
He says he knows you, boss.
Oh, well, just throw him out.
Ow!
Ow!
- Banzai!
- "I want candy"
"I want candy"
"Hey"
- "Hey"
- Hiya.
I didn't expect to see you here.
- Oh, what you doin' here?
- I came by to see Mr Macintosh.
- Oh, no, he's in a meeting.
- That's okay, I'll wait.
I just really need to see him.
- He's in meetings all day.
- All day?
- Swamped.
- Hey, I missed you at the bank.
I thought you were gonna come by and see me about opening up an account.
- Oh, I had to work.
- Wow.
This is where you work?
- Not too shabby.
- Comfortable.
- I brought an application.
- Do you still want to open up an account with me?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Do you have your deposit?
- I'll go get it.
Okay.
Great.
- Whoa!
- That's amazing!
Sorry, just printed it.
Two hundred dollars.
Looks like you fell into some money, huh?
- I make a living.
- Yeah, well, I guess Mr Macintosh...
He knows a good man when he sees one.
- Will he be opening up an account with us?
- Uh, maybe.
Yeah?
Great.
You know, I'd love to meet him.
How's tonight?
- Uh, tonight.
What's tonight?
- Tonight's Wednesday.
Wednesday.
Wednesday.
I'm sorry, he's busy.
- Too bad.
- Uh, but I'm not.
Oh, I handle all his financial affairs.
- You do?
- Not all of them, but I can tell you a lot about him, sort of like a pre-meeting.
- And he wouldn't mind?
- Hasn't complained yet.
Okay.
I'll come by around 8:00.
Okay.
Wait, I could send a car for you.
Okay.
Cool.
It's a date then.
Bye-bye.
A date?
A date?
I've never been on a date.
You know what they call me downtown?
The Babe-Meister.
Think about it.
Okay, I'm gonna tell you about the real deal on dating, which I know.
First of all, women love a great body.
They love...
Look at this bod.
- Whoa.
See?
- Yeah, yeah.
Of course, you've got a bod now that's of a Greek god.
Really.
Think about it.
Women like you to have a good bod because they want to feel they're protected.
You might have to fight some guy, you know?
But not with those arms.
You don't want to hit a guy with those arms 'cause those pythons would take a guy's head off.
Seriously.
You're buff, but we're gonna get you chiseled.
Okay?
Oh, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm having a vision here of a date.
- The perfect date for you guys.
- Uh, Steak Heaven!
Ho, ho!
My little friend, you really have the hots for this one, huh?
You know, if you really want to go upscale, that all-you-can-eat salad bar...
women love that.
And take some with you.
You know, line your pockets with plastic bags.
Put the food in there. 'Cause it doesn't say "All you can eat here."
Does it say "here" on the sign?
I don't think so.
So you take something back for later.
A little snackaroo.
Oh, women love that.
You get home and you got a pocketful of hot wings.
There's nothing more that impresses a woman.
Get yourself some flowers.
Get yourself a great body, some nice hair, some good clothes, a car, and learn to say words like "noncommittal."
You are a date and a half, pal.
"There he is Some Tiny Tim"
"There he is Six foot and risin'"
"Ooh, there he is He's a knockout machine"
- "He's number one He's double cool"
- Yeah!
"He's the naked truth in magazines"
- "I believe in him" - "Wonderman"
- "He is a Mr Wonderman" - "Wonderman"
"He is a Mr Wonderman"
"Ah, yes"
- "Wonderman"
- Ew.
- "Wonderman"
- One more!
Yes, yes, yes!
Ah!
Hey, I'm gonna get you!
You are little sushi man.
Sushi man down.
Big boy throw.
Then they chase around.
Come around other way, fall down.
Splat.
" Here comes the Wonderman He'd like to say bye-bye"
- Why are you dressed like a game show host?
- I'm going out tonight.
Just a minute, young man.
You're still grounded.
- But it's for Mr Macintosh.
- I don't care.
Macintosh may have a pile of money, but he doesn't decide... when my son is or isn't grounded.
- But it's for my job.
- Your job is to be grounded.
- Grounded.
- So much for Plan 442.
What do you know about Plan 442?
Well, it's the investment plan you've been working on, your "prespectus."
Prospectus.
What are you doing going through my work?
Well, I didn't want to say it, but I told Mr Macintosh... about your Plan 442, and he was very, very interested.
Yep, I promised him I'd bring a copy of it tonight and show it to him.
But I didn't want to tell you just in case you got your hopes all up and...
No, no, no, no, no, of course not.
Let me get you a fresh copy of the "prespectus."
- I'll get a copy of it, sweetheart.
- Prospectus.
Yeah.
- Here.
You're welcome.
- Oh, thank you.
Hurry up.
Go.
Go!
You want the car keys?
Nah, that's okay, Dad.
I don't drive yet.
- You want me to drive you?
- No, it's okay.
You know, I still haven't met Macintosh.
Maybe I should go over and...
- No!
You'll ruin everything.
- Why not?
He has a date tonight and he's very nervous about it.
- I guess I can see him first thing in the morning.
- Oh, I don't know, Dad.
I mean, he might be up pretty late with this woman.
Lucky dog.
Later, toads.
Thank you.
That's enough.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
I can't believe Mr Macintosh went to all this trouble.
- This place is great.
- Mr Macintosh has been eating here for years.
Oh, yeah?
I thought he just moved here.
There was a Tangerino where I used to live.
Oh.
Compliments of the chef for Mr Waters... and his lovely guest.
Th-They look like lobsters, only weenie.
Oh.
Mr Macintosh wanted you to have this too.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, wow.
This is beautiful.
Oh.
But I can't accept this from you.
But it's from Mr Macintosh.
- Why?
- Just a little business gift.
I mean, it's deductible, isn't it?
I'm not really sure, but it's way too expensive.
Mr Macintosh has a million dollars.
A million dollars doesn't buy all that much these days.
Do you think he should have asked for more?
What exactly does he do anyway?
Oh, a little of this, a little of that.
- You know.
- No, I'm afraid I don't.
- Oh, well...
- Is he an entrepreneur?
No, he's American.
Very secretive.
He has some questions for you too.
Okay.
Shoot.
- "Are you married?"
- No.
"What's the shortest guy you ever dated?"
Mmm.
I'm not really sure.
- "The youngest?"
- You know, these are pretty personal questions.
Well, Mr Macintosh is very interested in you.
- He is?
- He's, uh, never met anybody like you before.
He's never met me before, period.
Technically no, but he's been thinking a lot about you lately.
- He has?
- Yep.
Whoa!
Preston!
Are you okay?
Do you like hamburgers?
I love hamburgers.
Never saw this kid before in my life.
This is a waste of time.
Come on.
What's so special about this place?
- You'll see.
- Mmm, come on.
Tell me.
- Okay.
- You gonna tell me?
- Come with me.
- All right.
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.
- See what?
- Okay, get in the middle.
- Okay, ready?
Five, four, three,
- Here?
Two, one.
Holy smokes!
Okay!
Okay, now, come here, Shay!
- Okay, okay, now!
- Preston, I don't believe this!
Okay, now, let's run around!
- Don't get wet!
- Get us out!
Run!
- Okay, okay, okay!
- Watch out!
- No, we're gonna get soaked!
- No, no, no.
Now come...
Come around here!
Come around here!
Come on!
- Okay, hold onto me.
- Hey, where are you?
Yeah!
Yes!
- Whoo, yeah!
- Preston!
This is a great idea, Biderman.
Where's all the kids, huh?
Carl, it's late at night.
All the little boys and girls are tucked in bed.
What do you expect?
What I expect is when I give someone a million dollars, and I come back a day later,
I find the million dollars.
That's what I expect.
- Carl, I'm not a magician.
- You can make it disappear,
- you just can't get it back, right?
- I'm telling you...
If y'all want a kid so bad, there go one over there.
That's the little boy from the bank!
Shh.
Shh.
Go get him!
- Oh, I'll race ya to the limo!
I'll race ya to the limo!
- What?
Okay, I'll race ya!
- I got the door for ya!
- Open the door.
It's freezing!
Go, Henry!
Go, Henry, go!
Here we go!
He got away again!
I don't believe this!
He got away again!
This was the most fun.
- I haven't done anything like this since I was a little kid.
- Me neither.
Thank you so much.
When can I see you again?
Well, I really have to spend some time with my job right now.
Well, uh, I'm having a party.
On Friday.
Can you come?
It's for Mr Macintosh.
Um, it could be for your business, sort of.
Mr Macintosh will really be there?
Uh-huh.
It's his birthday.
Okay.
Well, great.
It's a date then.
Oh, I'm getting out up here.
It was really fun.
And, uh,
- I had such a good time.
- Me too.
- Good night, Preston.
- Good night, Shay.
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.
- Good night, ma'am.
Bye now.
It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.
So you're having a party Friday?
Oh, yeah, it's Mr Macintosh's birthday.
Oh, I thought you said it was your birthday Friday.
Well, we're gonna have a joint party for the both of us.
Oh.
Well, it's a good thing it worked out your birthdays are around the same time.
Hey, you wanna move that horse?
Come on.
What is this, Bonanza?
Let's go!
Well, here we are.
Home at last.
- Thanks, Henry.
- My pleasure.
Hey!
Preston Waters!
- Good night.
- You know what you got, pal?
- What?
- S-T-Y-L-E.
- Style.
Good night, Henry.
- Style.
Good night.
Take it easy, man.
Good night.
Macintosh and I are having the biggest birthday party ever.
- Honey, where's Preston?
- He's working for Macintosh.
Oh.
Where's Damien and Ralph?
They're working for Macintosh too.
Oh.
- Have you met Macintosh?
- No, I thought you met him.
- No, I haven't met him.
- Well, I haven't met him either.
Keep 'em comin'.
Mr Macintosh wants me to get plenty of practice.
Watch where you're hittin' those!
Quit messin' around.
Macintosh is watching.
Where?
We've still never seen him.
Just get back to work.
He's watching.
" ... coming out of the garage.
Ruining the neighborhood.
Hey, Preston!
Your party planner's here again.
Piston!
Piston!
Piston!
Turn off this contraption.
I have wonderful news.
Mr Macintosh's birthday is going to be the event of the century.
We gonna make the front page from coast to coast.
Oh, we are so lucky, lucky, lucky!
Now what kind of food does Mr Macintosh like?
- I don't know.
- And who are his friends?
- Do you have a guest list?
- Uh, I don't think so.
You know, dewdrop, I think I should meet him because...
I'm gonna need a little cash deposit.
Oh.
Uh, here.
Let me get you some cash.
Ooh, yes, you do have money, don't you?
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Careful walking around with this much money, darling.
Somebody could just rip you right off.
Now, this first $10,000 is going to be the deposit.
Now, of course, I'll get the balance at the party, and Mr Macintosh is good for it?
I am just so looking forward to meeting him.
- Who isn't?
- Waiters, security,
- guest list, paparazzi...
- Oh, and Yvonne?
- Yes?
- Remember, it's Preston.
Whatever!
Hey, uh, hey, Henry.
It's attack of the 50-foot chauffeur from hell!
I was just wondering if you wanted to play some video games.
Oh, man, I wish you'd have said something.
I can't.
I promised some friends I was gonna meet 'em in a while.
Oh, okay.
No problem.
I'll tell you what.
I'll drop you over at one of your friend's place... on the way over, and you can have some fun there.
Nah.
Maybe I'll go to the park.
All right.
It's up to you.
Hey, Preston,
- is my tie straight?
- Well, it looks perfect.
All right.
Later.
- Over here.
- Over here!
There it is.
That's the park up ahead.
Where did all these kids come from?
Keep driving and maybe someday I'll tell you.
- How could you hit a kid?
- I didn't hit a kid.
I ran over his bicycle.
I had a dog once that got hit by a train.
- Thanks for sharing, Juice.
- Old King Cole we called him.
- He was a merry old soul.
- It's him.
- Boy with the backpack.
- Go!
Go!
Go!
- The sign says "No Cars Allowed"!
- Just drive!
Quigley!
- You're gonna pay for this!
- Just drive!
- Carl, this isn't a good idea.
- Shut up!
Whoa!
Let go, man.
What's goin' on?
- Oooh!
- Oooh!
- I'm gonna get him.
- We're gonna tear him up!
- Reach over there and get him!
- Your butt is mine, kid!
I've been wantin' this little punk.
I own you!
I own you, kid!
Come here!
He's got my money!
Aaaah!
- Follow him on foot!
Go!
- Follow him on foot?
- Do I look like a bloodhound, a professional tracker?
- Juicy, listen.
If we don't get that kid, nobody gets paid.
- I want cash benefits, dental, everything.
- Not a problem.
Insurance!
Here, kiddie, kiddie!
Oh, there you go.
Come here, boy.
I'm gonna get you now.
I've been lookin' for you!
Huh?
Oh, no.
There he goes.
Yes.
Come here, boy!
I'm gonna get you now!
Aaaah!
Don't believe this!
Kill that kid when I find him.
I'm not gettin' paid for this.
- Where are we going now?
My hands are over my eyes.
- Shut up!
Get out...
There he is!
Stick with it!
I got ya!
I'll get you!
Hang on, hang on.
- Okay, there he is!
- Come here!
Come here!
- Juice!
Run after him.
- You must be crazy.
You run after him.
- Just ran through this whole entire park.
- Fine, get in the car.
Don't blow chunks in my car.
I just had it detailed.
- I'm cool!
- Are you sure?
Are you sure?
- I'm not gonna mess up your priceless detail.
- Come on.
Hey!
Wow, what's this?
- Let's go!
- After him!
- Hey, dude!
- Move outta the way.
Sorry!
- Get 'im!
- Your butt is mine!
I want this kid...
What are you doing?
- Yeah!
- No!
Carl, watch out!
Oh, no!
Whoa!
- Aah!
No!
- Oh, man!
Yes!
Now that's a display of fine driving right there.
You know, Carl, it might be easier just to steal another million dollars.
Hello, Mr Jackson.
Well, well, well, if it isn't the world's youngest personal injury attorney.
You know, you're in a lot of trouble today, little man.
Yeah, 'cause today I have been drinking vodka.
- Take a hike, butt-brain.
- What?
- Take a...
- Never mind, never mind.
Never mind, never mind!
Antoine, get that truck thing off the stage.
Thank you!
Get those golden gloves off!
Thank you!
Love, love, love, love!
What do you think?
Ta-da!
Is this to die, or what?
Uh, yeah, sure, it's, uh, to die.
I can't wait to show it to Mr Macintosh.
Come on, honey, let's see what they did with that...
"Is it to die for or what?"
Where did you find her?
Oh, man.
- What does this cost?
- I don't know.
- What do you think it should cost?
- Lots, lots.
Kid, why don't you just tell me what I need to know.
I'm a good guy.
Okay, how good are you going to be to me?
In round numbers.
I don't think you get the picture, sonny.
Maybe you need a better view.
Preston Waters, 1508 Oak Street, Hillsdale, Indiana!
Thank you.
- You all right?
- Aaah!
Aaah!
- Is something wrong?
- No, not at all.
- Is Mr Macintosh around?
- Uh, no.
- But he will be here tonight?
- Yeah.
- In person?
- In person.
- Okay.
I'll see you tonight?
- Okay.
Okay.
You're looking good.
Bye.
- I'll be calling.
- What a babe.
Baby brother comes into his own.
For a little weasel, he sure knows how to get a girlfriend.
- Too bad he picked a fortune hunter.
- Little love pilot... shot down in flames by a gold digger.
By a what?
Gold digger, someone who is only after money.
I know women, and that one is after Macintosh's cold, hard cash.
For your information, me and Shay already went on a date... and she had one fantastic time, boys.
Oh, yes, every second she was getting closer... and closer to Mr Macintosh.
- Shut up!
- Just answer me this.
Did she ever, ever just once, come by without saying,
"Meanwhile, I wonder if I could see Mr Macintosh?"
She's a gold digger, man.
She just wants Macintosh's money.
- Yeah!
Ow!
- Don't rub it.
Be a man.
- Don't rub it.
- I'll rub it if I want to.
- She wants a guy with money, not some little kid with an empty piggy bank.
- Yeah.
"Well, I'll wait by the windows I'll wait by the door"
"To make sure you don't come home"
- You ever known any gold diggers?
- Man, have I.
I hate 'em.
They're the worst.
Anybody who is your friend because you have money is not your friend at all.
You know what they say about gold?
"He who has the gold makes the rules"?
No, no, no.
"A fool and his gold are soon parted."
What does that mean?
"A fool and his gold are soon parted." Those old sayings, man,
I don't get 'em.
I don't even know really what that means.
"More than one way to skin a cat"?
Who skins cats?
Why would you skin a cat?
And there is not more than one way to skin a cat.
There is only one way.
You grab the cat, you rip the skin off the cat.
What is the number two way?
You put a hose up the cat's butt?
He gets so bloated that he skins himself?
Does he have a piece of Velcro under his butt?
No.
"Kill two birds with one stone." You heard that one?
You know anyone who has even killed one bird with one stone?
Kids try it all the time.
You can't hit a bird with a stone.
Unless you got a huge stone and they're tiny baby birds.
Then...
Beep, beep!
Dead.
"A fool and his gold are soon parted."
I guess it means that if you're a fool, your gold or your money is soon gone.
Once it's gone, it is outta there.
It is history.
It is dust.
It is vapor.
It is no more.
You are living in Brokesville.
- Unless you have Macintosh's kind of money.
- What if you don't?
I guess then you find out who your real friends are.
Man, we look good.
Is everybody having a good time?
- Good, you are.
- "Yes, we are, darling." Wow, look at the balloons.
- This is great.
Look at the ice sculpture.
- Presents!
Hey, hey, hey, kid, no touching.
Those are Mr Macintosh's.
Go find your parents.
Go on, get outta here.
Go on!
- I just want to see Mr Macintosh.
- I just want to pig out.
Hey, look at that.
Excuse me.
- Sorry!
- Exactly who are you looking for, Preston?
- Have you seen Shay?
- I haven't seen her, but she'll be around.
Come on...
Oh, man, look at all this food!
Macintosh doesn't show, we bring the kid in, agreed?
If Preston says Macintosh is gonna be there, Macintosh will be there.
But you don't make a move, until I give you the signal, understood?
We got eight men ready to go in and nail him the second he shows up!
We close this deal tonight!
Where's the pizza and the ice cream?
What's going on here?
This could have been a pizza before it got run over by a couple of trucks.
Oh, that looks tasty.
Looks like something you'd find between your toes.
Ah, ah, ah!
It's sucking the life outta me!
- Shut up!
Everybody's looking.
- So what?
Who cares?
Relax, have a good time.
She'll show up.
Oh, there's Shay now.
Ha!
Just kidding.
I was kidding ya!
Would you just relax?
She'll be here.
It's not at all what you thought it'd be like?
Hate being rich, huh?
Preston?
Preston?
Ice cream, ice cream.
Yoo-hoo, Preston!
Now, where is our mystery man?
It's time for Mr Macintosh to make his appearance.
I like to give my employers their bills directly.
That way if they have any questions or heart attacks or something...
- I'll give it to him.
- Fine.
Be quick about it.
$100,000?
Sweetheart, I know this seems like a whole lot of money to normal people like me and you, but to a man like Macintosh this is just pennies.
- Now, you get up there and get me my money!
- Ow!
I'll get your money.
$100,000.
Not a problem.
You can leave it.
This is fine.
I'll be right back.
Thank you.
Transaction not possible.
Insufficient funds.
$332.17.
- Transaction not possible.
- Three hundred dollars?
- Insufficient funds.
Transaction not possible.
- Oh, no!
- No, please, God.
- Insufficient funds.
This can't be right.
One, two, three, four...
It's gone.
It's all gone.
Mr Macintosh?
Oh, sorry to bother you.
It's Fred Waters, Preston's dad.
I know you got a bash going on here, so I'll make it brief.
But, uh,
I wanted to ask you a favor.
You see, today is Preston's birthday and if you see him, if you could send him home a little early.
Lately he's been working so hard.
All of a sudden money's become so important to him.
I guess that's mostly my fault.
You don't have kids, do you, Mr Macintosh?
I'll tell you, it's very easy to make mistakes with them.
I haven't always paid enough attention to my kids.
I pushed them too hard... maybe.
Especially Preston.
I guess I expect more from him.
He reminds me of myself at that age.
I couldn't wait to grow up.
I'm afraid he's missing out on his childhood.
So am I.
Well, thanks.
I won't take up any more of your time.
And we appreciate you sending Preston home early.
If...
If he wants to come, that is.
- I want to come home.
- Thanks.
Dad.
Dad?
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad, wait!
Daddy!
Henry?
Henry!
Wait a minute, where's Henry?
Your driver?
He left a little while ago.
H-He left?
You sure it was Henry?
Big guy, white limo.
He's gone.
Thanks.
Now I know who my friends are.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Preston?
Mr Macintosh?
- Mr Macintosh?
- It's just me.
- Which one of us did you want?
- I was looking for you.
- Oh, good.
- And Mr Macintosh.
Look, it's very, very important that I find Mr Macintosh right now.
- Do you understand?
- He's nowhere.
- He's gone.
I think you'd better leave too.
- Preston...
- you could be in danger.
- Just go, okay?
You got your necklace.
Just take it and leave.
"Give it back There's no time to lose"
"So give it back Give it back"
Riggs?
Riggs?
Riggs?
Looks like no one's home.
- Shut up, Wienerman.
- Biderman.
- Where is he?
- I don't know, but he might be down the street... at Mr Macintosh's, that's his boss.
Macintosh.
Come on!
You know, I do like what they have done with this color.
There you are, puppy-butt.
Did you get me my money?
- Uh, Macintosh has disappeared.
- What?
Now, I am warning you, Tom Thumb, don't you trifle with me.
If I don't get paid, I will sue Mr Macintosh... for every dime he is worth!
Well, be sure and tell me when you find him.
Okay, little Mr Man, this party is over!
Quiet!
Stop that playing!
Stop that music!
Quiet!
Attention!
Attention!
Everybody, this party is over!
Our host...
can't pay his bills!
- Mr Macintosh is a fraud!
- What?
Who's that kid?
She's right.
Hate to tell you this, but there's been a terrible mistake.
Nobody s-should have been invited.
Macintosh is... is gone.
And he's not coming back.
So I think you should all leave too, so go.
Go on.
Close down the bar!
Come on, let's get outta here.
Come on, Antoine.
Move it!
Come on, move it!
Come back with those glasses!
Give me that!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Henry?
Henry!
I knew you'd come back!
Henry...
Happy birthday.
I'm here to blow out your candles.
- Oh!
Let me go!
- What's your hurry, kid?
Got a big check to cash?
- Let me go!
- I like this pad.
What do you think, Juice?
Oh, yeah, I like the pad.
It looks real nice.
- Can you handle it?
Got the TV, drums.
- Oh, I like this.
- TV, drums.
- All kinds of toys.
- He's got a little taste, a little flavor.
- What's this thing here?
- I don't think I've seen one of those before.
- How do you work this?
Well, you turn the knob...
You really shouldn't let him in such a nice house as this.
All your stuff could get broken.
Kid, where's Macintosh?
N-Nowhere.
He's nowhere.
I'm going to ask you one more time.
Where is he?
Huh!
There is no Macintosh.
- I made him up.
It was me the whole time.
- Don't give me that.
- Who bought this house?
- I-I did.
You?
You outbid me?
Wait a minute.
You tryin' to tell me that this little boy here... outbid you with your own money?
Be a fly on the wall, okay, Juice?
Listen, kid, you know it's illegal to take things that don't belong to you.
I know.
I feel awful.
Take me to the police.
- Carl, don't do it.
It's a trick.
- Get outta here.
Son, I don't want to take you to the police.
Just tell me, okay?
Where's my money?
I-I spent it.
- All of it?
- All of it.
How could you spend... a million dollars in six days?
You must not have been shopping lately.
Carl, Carl, wait a minute.
Maybe we're thinking about this Macintosh thing in the wrong way.
- What are you talking about?
- You needed a new house, a new identity.
This kid, he's done it for you.
I mean, Macintosh could run for mayor here.
Yeah, I kind of like the idea of that...
Mayor Quigley.
No, no, Mayor Macintosh.
I like it.
Look, there's only one problem with that.
The...
Aaah!
- Hey!
- Come back here!
- Wait for me!
I'm coming!
- He's upstairs, man!
Break it down!
Break it down!
There he is!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
- He went down there!
- Juice, go after him!
- I ain't goin' down there.
- Go on!
Now!
- You're crazy.
I ain't goin' down there.
- Watch your head.
- What is it, about 230...
Whoa!
- Aaah!
- I'm not goin' in there.
- Oh, no, he didn't.
- Did you see him?
- Oh, no, you did just push me in the pool!
- Get out, we gotta find him!
What?
What happened?
Act like you got a purpose in life.
Go.
I think I'm experiencing chest pains.
Carl?
Juice?
Huh?
Oh.
Little boy?
Little boy from the bank?
Ha, ha.
Oh!
Where am I?
Oh-oh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Hey, hey!
Got ya!
Uh-huh!
- Hey!
- Got him.
It's time for a little batting practice.
Here we go!
Hey!
What's happening?
Whoa!
Hey!
Just outside.
Let's try a sinker.
A sinker!
Another!
Another!
Let's try a screwball!
- Turn, turn, turn!
- Be cool!
Ow!
Hey!
Ho!
Come on, boy!
Screwball!
Boom!
Whoa!
Oooh!
- That must have hurt!
- My god!
Fastball, fastball!
Just inside!
- Oooh!
Ow!
- What's next, Juice?
How about tennis?
It's over, kid.
Ow!
Ow!
Preston, come out, come out, wherever you are.
None of this would have happened, you know, if you hadn't been a bad boy!
Tell me something, did you think you were going to get away with it?
Spending somebody else's hard-earned money?
Huh!
We need to have a chat.
Preston...
I'm not mad any more.
I know you're sorry.
Come on, buddy.
Pres?
Come on out now!
Banzai!
Quigley, I'll be back in a minute.
Don't leave me here...
Oh, where am I goin'?
- Whoa!
Kid!
- Don't you move.
Juice!
Biderman!
Get your useless butt over here!
Whoa!
Oh!
Oh!
Kid!
Kid!
What are you doin'?
Oh!
Oh!
Kid, kid, stop, please, please!
Stop!
Oh!
Kid, please!
Don't do that!
Ooooh!
Quigley?
Are you okay?
Aaah!
I got you now!
Come get him!
I got him now.
Come get him, you guys.
All right, hold him.
- Baseballs!
- You're not a very nice boy, you know that?
- Freeze!
- Preston, are you okay?
What's this all about?
What's happening here?
Stanley?
What are you doing here?
- Let go!
- As of this moment, you're fired from my bank!
F.B.I., Biderman.
From this moment, you're fired from your bank.
- What?
- You're with the F.B.I.?
- Yes, Preston, I am.
- Okay, kid, finally, at long last, who's Macintosh?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...
- I'm Macintosh.
- You're Macintosh?
I'm Macintosh!
And I want you all off my property now!
- He's Macintosh.
- You sure?
I tell ya, I'm Macintosh!
Please tell these guys I'm Macintosh.
- Oh, he's Macintosh.
Don't you know Papa Macintosh?
- Mr Macintosh.
And Big Mama Macintosh be hangin' out with the brothers.
Mr Macintosh, you're under arrest for fraud, money laundering and grand theft.
- What are you talking about?
- Bring in Biderman too.
- I'm a banker!
- And take Mr Wise Guy too.
- Who?
Me?
I'm not wise.
- Get your hands off me.
- Man, I flunked recess.
- Take it easy, man.
- Take 'em out.
- I'm not even from here, man.
- I'm a banker.
- I was roaming down the street.
Cat said, Hey, there's a party.
- I own a bank!
Sir, stay behind the line there.
Everyone, just calm down, okay?
Honey, I'm gonna check this out, make sure that Preston's okay.
You take the boys home.
- What's going on?
- Something to do with Macintosh.
The F.B.I. Is all over.
- Uh, have you seen my son, a little boy?
- He's inside with the F.B.I.
- Excuse me, excuse me, please.
Officer...
- Whoa, whoa!
- Nobody gets in there without a badge, sir.
- I'm looking for my son.
Kind of neat.
Can I see your badge?
Shay Stanley, F.B.I.
Cool.
Wait a minute.
So that means our date... was just for your...
just for your job?
Well, it started out like that.
I should have known.
Hey, you know, I wouldn't have traded that night for anything.
So when can I see you again, Shay?
Mmm, why don't you give me a call in, say, about ten years?
- Five.
- Seven.
- Six.
- Okay, it's a date.
Good night, Preston.
Preston!
Preston?
Oh, my god, he's in shock.
Oh, oh, I'm fine, Dad.
I'm fine now.
Oh, I'm glad to see you.
- What's going on here?
- It's a long story.
- Well, why don't we go on home, you tell me all about it?
- Okay.
I want to say goodbye to a friend, okay, Dad?
Wow, this is just great.
I can't step out for a couple of seconds.
I miss all the action.
Thanks.
- Are you okay?
- I thought you left, man.
No, I didn't leave.
What did we say the party needed?
Ice cream, right?
I just went to get ice cream.
I don't know if I got the exact recipe, but I think I got it close.
- So?
- Hey, it's pretty close.
Well, I guess Macintosh is no more, huh?
It's too bad, because, uh, I really enjoyed working for him.
- I had a good time too...
- Do me a favor?
Next time you see him, tell him, uh, that I'm really gonna miss him.
I'll miss you too, Henry.
You're gonna do just fine.
See ya.
- Hey, Henry.
- Huh?
- Know what you have?
- What?
- S-T-Y-L-E, style.
- Style.
Hey, Preston, you're not gonna finish this ice cream, I guess, huh?
Well, no sense letting' this go to waste.
So, what happened?
Oh, well, uh, Macintosh wasn't...
He...
He wasn't who he thought he was.
- How do you mean?
- Well, he shouldn't have done what he did.
He shouldn't have fooled everybody.
I think you're right.
It's been a long night.
Better get on up to bed.
Yeah, I think I ought to get some sleep too, Dad.
And tomorrow, I'll tell you all about Mr Macintosh.
Sleep well, Preston.
Ta-da!
"Happy birthday to you"
"Happy birthday dear Preston"
"Happy birthday to you"
Make a wish.
You know what they say, "Be careful what you wish for."
Oh.
What else do I want?
I mean, I got everything... that I need right here.
On the other hand.
Unavalaible-a.k.a
[Panting]
[Thunder Rumbling]
[Grunting]
Where are you?
Oh.
Hello, beautiful.
[Kissing Sound]
Did you miss me?
Dad, I've given this some thought... and I've decided that since Damien and Ralph have their own rooms, well, there's no reason why they should be bringing their junk into my room.
Well, how does that sound, Helen?
- [Gulping] - [Door Opening]
- Out of the way, stick boy!
- Hand Foot is here to stay.
- Oops, kicked your baby monkey.
- Get out of here, Ralph!
- Here, take this.
- Go away, Damien.
This is my room.
Was.
Now it's also the world headquarters of Hand Foot, Incorporated.
- Hand Foot all the way!
- Hand Foot, Hand Foot, Hand Foot!
- Hand Foot?
You guys aren't gonna make a dime.
- Okay, we'll use this.
- Yeah!
- Hey, that's my life savings!
- Consider yourself our silent partner.
- Yeah, say something and you're dead.
- Yeah.
- How's the big move going?
- Great.
- Good.
Come on, Ralph.
Gotta get to work.
Dad?
[Clears Throat]
Dad... well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've decided that...
- s-s-since Damien and Ralph have their own room...
- Preston, they need the space for their business.
- Not my space.
- Young man, in this family, industry gets rewarded.
While you're in here playing, your brothers are hard at work.
- Yeah, kissing' butt for money.
- [Ralph] Well, you know the golden rule.
- He who has the gold makes the rules.
- One day you'll have a job.
- When I was your age, I had my own business cleaning wheels.
- [Mimicking Dad]
I was pulling down 100 bucks a week polishing cars.
- You used to say 75.
- Well, you gotta think big, Preston.
- Surprise.
- [Brothers] Whoa, check it out.
Yeah, it's for your business.
We had a spare at the office.
- Damien, the speakers are out in the hall.
- How does it work?
It imitates human intelligence, like you guys.
- Preston, maybe you could teach your brothers how to use it.
- Not possible.
[Dad] The software will teach you how to do everything but make love to a woman.
- Now I know what programme to get your father for Christmas.
- Mom!
- Oops!
Uh, here.
Let me help you with that.
- Preston, you're gonna be late...
- for Butch's birthday party.
- Who wants to celebrate Butch's birth?
- [Dad] It's important to get out of your room more.
- [Brothers] Our room.
Well, good luck, guys.
[Computer Beeps, Talks] Damien and Ralph sleep... butt to face, butt to face,
- butt to face,
- Huh?
- Who said that?
- Butt to face, butt to face,
- Type "Quit." Hit "Delete."
- Butt to face, butt to face, butt to face...
- Turn it off!
Pull the plug!
- Ow!
- Don't rub it.
Be a man.
- [Moaning] Ouch!
- Little wimp.
[Dad] Come on, Preston.
You don't want to be late for Butch's birthday party.
- Are you gonna have fun today?
- [Preston] How can I, Dad?
- I don't have any money.
- Now, look.
Here's a couple of bucks.
Ah, heck, you can have fun all day on that.
You don't get out much, do you, Dad?
[P.A.] Welcome to Fun Land.
Fun, fun, fun for everyone.
Welcome to Fun Land.
Fun, fun, fun for everyone.
- Hey.
Hey, man.
- Hey, Butch.
Hey, man.
Yeah!
Hey, what's up?
Oh, look.
It's Presto the Pesto.
- Hello, Butch.
- [Kids Laughing]
Oh!
- Tokens!
- [Kids Cheering]
- Give me 50.
It's my birthday.
- Fifty.
- Twenty-five, please.
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-seven.
- Twenty-seven.
- Six, please.
- Six.
Six.
- Coming?
- I don't know.
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
- [Shouting]
- It's gonna be awesome!
- Yeah, let's go over here!
- This one!
- Hurry!
[Butch] Hey, Preston!
Hey, over here!
- Hey, Preston, how's your ostrich?
- Watch out!
Preston has an ostrich!
Hey, Preston, come with us!
- Just kidding!
- [Laughing]
[Groaning]
[Dad] Did you have fun at Butch's birthday party?
I have a question.
Are we broke?
- No, we just have to watch our spending habits.
- That's right.
Like when your mother calls her sister back East and talks for 97 minutes.
So if we're not poverty-stricken, there must be some other reason I'm so deprived.
- We're outta here!
Whoo!
- Goin' to the ball game.
- Can I go?
- We bought tickets, toad.
- [Mother] Damien!
- You need some cash?
- Nah, we got a bunch of change.
- Later, Preston.
It's not fair.
Why can't I have anything?
Well, Preston, they have jobs, and they've learned to save.
How can I save money if I don't have any?
A penny saved is a penny earned.
- What do you want for your birthday?
- Money... so I can pay to have Ralph and Damien knocked off.
Anything else?
Well, maybe we'll give him one of his birthday presents early.
A gift came from Grandma today.
Hmm.
What a rip-off!
It's a cheque for nothing!
I'm having a bad day.
Oh, your grandma just forgot to fill in how much it was for, but she signed it at the bottom, see?
It's a blank cheque.
- We'll just fill in the amount.
- How much did you get last year, honey?
A thousand.
- Ten dollars.
- Wait, Dad.
What about inflation?
- Oh, make it 11.
- [Muttering]
You'd be surprised how fast... eleven dollars can grow with interest.
Preston?
Preston?
[Preston] Eleven dollars... at 3.45 interest.
[Computer] Your account will reach... one million dollars... in 342,506 years.
I'm stuck here forever.
- [Dad] Lights out up there.
- Why?
My house, my rules.
"My house, my rules."
My own house.
[Yawning]
[Engine Stops, Car Door Shutting]
[Man] Dave, who needs assets?
I'm your asset.
- I'm a big asset.
Oh, c...
- [Man On Phone] I can't believe you.
Dave, Dave.
Come on, come on.
Why only borrow 150,000?
Our money is your money.
Round it off to two.
- Do I qualify?
- Of course you qualify for the loan, Dave.
We're golf partners.
- You don't look happy to see me.
- Quig...
- Quigley.
- Quigley.
That's funny.
I don't remember you stuttering on the witness stand.
- You just sang like a bird, didn't you?
- I had no choice, Carl.
- I mean, lying in court...
- You also pointed at me.
- That hurt.
- Well, I was under oath.
- I mean...
- Come here.
The only reason you're alive, Biderman, is I knew I might need you again someday...
like today.
Oh, sure.
You need a loan?
The rates are great now.
- And you get a toaster.
- I don't need a toaster.
Before I went away, I put aside a little nest egg.
[Gasping] These bills, they're marked consecutively.
- They'd trace these in a minute.
- That's right.
- [Coughing]
- That's where you come in, old buddy.
I want new bills.
- We're back in the SL business, Biderman.
- Ah, money laundering...
- is very difficult these days, Carl.
- You still do it though, don't you?
That's a good-looking family right there.
You're not gonna hurt them, are you?
- Hate to have to.
- All right.
How do you want to do this?
- I'll send my guy in tomorrow with a cheque for a million.
- Tomorrow?
Yep, just like the old days.
You give him the cash, unmarked, send him on his way.
- Whom should I expect?
- Whom should...
Whom should you expect?
His name is Juice.
- Juice?
- Mmm, he'll be here in exactly 24 hours.
Let's call it 1:00.
Come on.
Walk me out.
Show a little respect.
Whoa.
I know how you feel.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Can you see okay?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, sure.
I would like to open an account, please.
Eleven dollars.
Do you have any other money you'd like to deposit, Mr Waters?
Oh, uh, I could, but it's sort of hard to save around my house; that's why I'm here.
I'm afraid we have a minimum balance.
It's $200.
Two hundred dollars?
That could take a million years.
Well, whenever you're ready, please come back and see me.
My name's Shay Stanley.
- Ask for me.
- Okay, I'll do that.
- Thanks.
- Bye-bye.
- I-I'll see you next time.
- I hope it's not in a million years.
B-Bye-bye.
[Biderman] Excuse me.
Carl, Carl!
Here.
You can use these cheques.
They're temporary.
- Thank you, Edward.
- Like our relationship.
- Sucker!
- Give me that!
- [Laughing]
- Give it to me!
Butch, give it to me!
- Preston, come on!
- Butch!
- Give it back!
Whoa!
- If you can catch me!
Come on, Butch!
[Control Panel Dings, Engine Revs]
[Preston Screams]
- [Screaming] - [Tyres Screeching]
Perfect.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
L...
I...
- Huh?
- [Butch] I saw the whole thing.
- I can be a witness if the price is decent.
- Get outta here.
He's perfectly all right, aren't you?
Aren't you?
- Yes.
- Good.
Get that thing out from underneath my car.
What about my bike?
- Kid, was I the one that parked there...
- Oh, my word!
- Are you all right?
- He's fine.
It was just a little accident.
He's okay.
- I think this guy's been drinking vodka.
- I have not been drink...
[Laughs] I don't drink at all.
Seriously, seriously.
Kid, talk to me.
How much you want for the bike?
- A thousand bucks.
- I'm not talking to you!
Bye, kid.
Go on.
Walk away.
What do you want, kid?
Name a figure, we'll discuss it.
Give this to your dad.
He'll know what to do with it.
I gotta go.
[Tyres Screeching]
[Tyre Squeaking]
Oh, man.
I thought we understood about taking care of our valuables.
Valuable?
It was a piece of junk.
If that's how you feel about a gift from your parents,
I don't see giving you a new one for your birthday.
I don't want a new bike.
I want my own room.
I'm warning you.
You're on thin ice as it is about the bike.
You know what I want?
What I want is my own house.
My rules, my money.
Listen, young man, until further notice, you're grounded.
What'd I do wrong?
[Sighs] Fred.
Hmm.
It's a blank cheque.
"[Computer Start-Up Tone]
Preston Waters.
Two hundred.
Hmm.
A thousand.
Hmm.
One million dollars.
Cash.
Whoa!
One million dollars.
[Electronic Zooming]
Hey, sonny.
Cashin' a big one today?
Uh, sort of.
Yoo-hoo.
Over here, young man.
- Well?
- I-I-I'd like to... cash this cheque, please.
Oh, a comedian.
[Laughing]
- N-No, ma'am.
- Okay, then we better take it to Mr Biderman.
Come on!
- [Ticking] - [Door Opening]
Excuse me, Mr Biderman.
We have a little problem here.
What is it, Mrs Udowitz?
- Someone thinks this is some kind of game.
- What?
Let me see that.
I see.
Is there much of a line out there, Mrs Udowitz?
- Yes, we're swamped.
- Then what are you doing here?
Please.
[Door Closes]
- Juice?
- No, thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Not thirsty.
Mr Quigley give you this cheque?
He did.
He did.
How did you run into Mr Quigley?
I didn't.
He ran into me.
Aha.
[Snickering]
[Laughing] Brilliant.
Brilliant!
- [Groans]
- I suppose you want big bills.
Actually, regular size would be okay.
Regular.
Hmm.
That's cute.
Put your backpack on the table.
Hey, hey.
I assume you know what to do with this.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
Next!
Look here, sweetheart.
Mmm, you're lookin' kind of good there.
You got your pearls and everything on.
Hate for something to have to happen to 'em.
Look here, my name is Juice... and I got something right here, and I wondered... if you'd be so kind enough as to cash it for me.
What do you want?
A million bucks?
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.
[Sighs] Go see Biderman.
Mm-mm.
Oh, my goodness gracious.
Here we go.
Here we go.
You tell Mr Quigley that he hasn't lost his touch.
- Uh-huh.
- All right.
You can go now.
Hey, kid!
- Stay away from the racetrack.
- Yes, sir.
Good one, man.
Looking good.
Mmm.
Oh!
Excuse me, sweetie.
[Gasps]
- What's wrong with you, little boy?
- [Preston] I'm sorry.
Don't be messin' up a view as good as all that.
- I-I'm sorry.
- What you doin' out of school anyway, huh?
You know you oughta be in school.
Go on and get up outta here before I start to get upset.
Hurry up.
How, uh...
How may I help you, sir?
I'm big Juice, man.
Quigley sent me.
Everything is fine.
- Not to worry.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah!
- The Eagle has landed.
- Hmm?
The horse is in the barn.
The chicken...
is in the pot.
Look here, man, I don't know nothin' about no eagles landing' and all of that.
I don't know nothin' about no horse running' through the barn.
And I certainly don't know nothin' about no... chickens bein' in the pot.
You understand?
But if you do me a favour... as to be so kind as to cash this cheque right there,
- I could be on my way.
- Wait.
- Quigley sent you?
- That's right.
- What about the kid?
- What kid?
Man...
The kid!
The kid with the backpack!
Look here, man.
I'm tired of tellin' you this.
But if you don't give me the money for that cheque,
I guarantee there's a bullet with your name on it in this chamber.
[Moaning] The kid with the backpack.
The kid with the backpack!
The backpack!
The backpack!
Shit!
Oh, my god!
[Quigley] 150 grand, cash.
- It's my last offer, guys.
- [Woman] You're our Realtor.
You tell us.
This offer is so much less than our asking price.
Well, Mrs Appleton, it really is a buyer's market.
Do you mind if we take a minute to think about it?
Listen, I got all the time in the world, sweetheart.
Too bad I can't say the same for you two.
Applesauce, what's with the long face, my man?
I bought your pad.
You've got some cash.
It's a beautiful thing.
Su casa is soon to be mi casa.
You know what I'm saying?
- Groovin' thing, man.
- Yeah, well...
[Dial Tone]
- " [Start-Up Tone] - [Sighs]
[Phone Ringing]
- Hello.
- [Computer] Good afternoon.
...your house.
- [Computer Beeps]
I'd like to make a cash offer on your house.
Someone else wants to make an offer.
What?
On this dump?
- Uh, hello, sir.
Can you hear me?
- Who is this yo-yo?
[Typing]
- [Computer] One-sixty.
- What kind of hustle is this?
And what's with your voice, pal?
Sore throat-itis.
[Computer Coughs]
Yeah.
I'll tell you what.
One-seventy right now, cash, and I walk away.
- You take it or leave it right now.
- Ask the box.
One-eighty, plus closing costs.
- One-eighty, - [Preston] Top that, sucker.
Plus closing costs.
- One-ninety, darlin'.
Top that.
- Preston, honey?
I have a few errands to run.
I'll be back by 2:00.
Okay.
Bye, Mom.
- [Computer] Two hundred.
- Two-ten.
- Just to be safe, make that 3:00.
- [Laughs]
- Three hundred?
- Ma, you're killin' me on this deal.
Come on.
Are you tellin' me we're gonna sit here and listen... to some talking box with a robot voice?
What is this?
Uh, 300 it is.
Are you prepared to top 300?
No, I don't think I'm prepared to top 300!
Are you out of your mind?
We had a deal here!
Are you Realtors just a bunch of crooks?
Is that it?
What's going on with you people?
Well, I am sorry you feel that way, but I have an offer on the table of 300.
- [Computer] Thousand.
- Uh, we'll take it.
- Sold.
- Yeah.
You probably won't live to enjoy the cash.
[Realtor] Just one thing, sir.
What is your name?
My name is Preston...
Bingo.
Macintosh.
My name is Macintosh.
Well, congratulations, Mr Macintosh.
- You have a house.
- Yes!
I'm rich!
Yeah!
Whoo, yes!
Yeah!
Money!
Money!
- You did what with my money?
- [Juice] You're not gonna believe this.
He gave all your money to a little old bitty boy.
That was my nest egg.
That's all I had to start a new life.
I worked hard to steal that money, Biderman!
You gave it to some zit-faced little kid?
Now wait a minute.
I seen the kid.
- His skin looked pretty smooth.
- The boy had a cheque signed by you.
I didn't write a cheque to anybody except for this genius here.
Now hold on a minute.
I'm not the one who cashed a cheque for a million dollars.
- That was this man right here.
- Had your signature.
I said I didn't write it!
You gave me the cheque-book,
I put it in my pocket, I got in my car, I... I...
I can't feel my legs.
Uh, I...
Oh, oh, oh.
Calm down.
I've got a surveillance photo of the boy.
[Stammering] We'll find him in no time.
- Oh, yeah, that's him.
- I can't see a thing.
I recognize him.
I'd know him anywhere.
It's upside-down.
All right.
So where are you gonna find the kid, Mr Family Man?
- Newspapers.
- You want me to advertise, is that it?
No, no, no.
They have listings.
Uh, family activities where, where...
You know, things where kids go.
See?
Fine.
You're gonna help me find him.
- You understand?
Dead or alive.
- Uh-huh.
Let's get out of here.
- Oh, don't think you ain't comin' with us.
- [Gasping]
Somebody's in there with Biderman now.
A couple of guys I've never seen before.
They've just left.
The money laundering is definitely on again.
We've got to notify the Bureau right away.
[Man] Hello, Limousines Unlimited.
- You have the car keys?
- No, you have the car keys.
- Oh, yeah.
You make sure you-know-who stays grounded.
- And he goes to bed early.
- You got it, Pops.
- Don't call me that.
Uh, excuse me.
Sorry, kid.
Nobody famous inside.
Do you want to take your mitts off the car, please?
- I'm waitin' for a client here.
- But I'm your client.
Oh, right, yeah.
And I'm Madonna.
Sorry, kid.
The boss doesn't like me taking baseball cards as payment.
So if you want to ride in this, you need some buckaroos, buckarinis, some moola, some dinero, some money, some frogskins, much similar to the money you've given me...
In fact, identical to the money you've given me right now.
I was just kiddin' about bein' Madonna.
- My name's Henry.
- Hi, Henry.
I'm Preston.
- Preston, good to see ya.
- Preston Waters.
Yes, nice to meet ya.
Hop in.
Go ahead.
I didn't actually mean hop in, but...
So, where to, boss?
- Well, Harry, we're gonna go buy some stuff.
- Yes, sir.
[Tyres Screeching]
"Hey, yeah"
"Ow, whoo"
"The best things in life are free"
"But you can keep them for the birds and bees"
- "Now give me money" - "That's what I want"
- "That's what I want, yeah" - "That's what I want"
- "That's what I want Yeah" - "That's what I want"
"That's what I want"
"Baby, your lovin' gives me a thrill"
"But your lovin' never paid my bills"
- "Now give me money" - "That's what I want"
- "That's what I want" - "That's what I want"
- "That's what I want" - "That's"
"What I want"
"That's what I want"
"Give it to me, baby Uh-huh"
- "Oh" - "Money"
"I want m-m-m-m-money Yeah"
"I got to have some money"
- " I want to have the money Uh-huh, hey, hey" - "Money"
"Hey, yeah"
"Money don't get everything it's true"
"What it don't get now I can't use"
- "I want m-m-m-money, hey" - "That's what I want"

- "That's what I want" - "Ow, hey"
- Ice cream!
Turn around, Henry.
- Oh, right on.
"I need some money, baby I need some money"
"I just need a few"
- Hey, thanks a lot for the great watch.
- You're welcome.
- Hey, this guy, uh...
What is it?
Mclntyre?
- Macintosh.
Uh, Macintosh.
Yeah, yeah.
If you don't mind me askin', where does he get his money?
Well, he doesn't get it, he just has it.
Why does he get a kid like you to go out and buy all this stuff for him?
He...
He never had a real childhood.
So now that he's really, really rich, he can have all the fun that he couldn't have when he was a kid.
- Oh.
Oh, I see.
- You know.
So he didn't have any fun when he was a kid, but now he's old and he's got money.
You're a kid having the fun for him now... that he couldn't have when he was a kid.
- Okay, sure.
- Stop!
Pull over, Henry!
It's Shay!
- Stop!
Hey!
- [Shay Screams] You scared me!
- Sorry.
- Preston, right?
- You've got a good memory.
- Thanks.
- Great, kid.
Very nice.
- Nice wheels.
Oh, this?
Ah, it's my boss, Mr Macintosh.
- Do you want a ride?
- No, thanks.
I'm outta shape.
Not from where I'm sittin' you aren't.
So, uh, I'm thinkin' about comin' into the bank tomorrow...
- and opening my account.
- Wow, you got the $200 already?
- Just about.
- All right.
Well, see you tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Was that him?
Was that Biderman?
- No, some kid who came into the bank today.
- Nice wheels for a kid.
Yeah.
Says it belongs to his boss, a guy named Macintosh.
Macintosh.
When are we gonna see Biderman?
[Man] It looks like a circus.
Hey.
Hey, hey, move it.
I've got work to do too, you know.
Where am I supposed to go?
You see an opening?
Huh?
Hey, what's the holdup here?
- Yeah, same to you, buddy.
- Hey, move it!
What is all this?
What a mess.
This is absolute madness!
Yo, who's in charge here?
[Preston Over Speaker] You with the race car, put it in the backyard.
Uh, the water slide goes back by the pool.
You guys with the TVs, put them in the living room.
Hey, you with the Cadillac, out by the pool.
You in the green jumpsuits, bring that around the back.
- Preston?
- Hi, Dad.
- What's going on here?
- Movin' in.
- Who is moving in?
- Macintosh.
- Who's Macintosh?
- I'll be right with you, Dad.
Come on, boys.
I don't have all day.
Okay, Mr Waters, the security system is all in place.
Excuse me.
This is the remote.
Here are the instructions.
All right?
We appreciate Mr Macintosh's business.
Here you go, pal.
What's with all the security?
Mr Macintosh says you can never be too paranoid, Dad.
- Well, who is Macintosh?
- I work for him.
He's paying me.
Yeah, but who is he?
I never met him.
- You mean you haven't met him?
- No, I haven't met him.
- He's heard about you.
- Really?
Yeah, about work and stuff.
Really good things.
- Well...
His stuff is blocking our driveway.
- Dad.
Boys!
Could you clear a path, please?
Get a move on it!
All set, Dad.
"I knew a guy who was tough but sweet"
[Henry] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
"He's the one He can't be beat"
"He's got everything that I desire"
- "Sets the summer sun on fire"
- Brake, brake!
"I want candy"
- "I want candy"
- Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip!
- "Yeah" - [Game] Body blow.
Uppercut.
- Body blow.
Left hook.
Uppercut.
Body blow.
- Ow.
- Uppercut.
- Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
Body blow.
Ten, nine...
- "I want candy"
- Yeah!
Yes!
"I want candy"
"Go to see him when the sun goes down"
- Come on, Henry!
Come on!
- "Ain't no finer boy in town"
- Hey!
Whoa!
- "I want candy"
- Oh, Henry!
- "I want candy"
- The blood rushed to my head.
- "Hey"
"Hey"
"Hey"
"Hey, hey"
[Woman] Is something wrong?
No.
I was wondering who could spend cash like that these days.
Oh, yeah.
The man's name is Macintosh.
- Macintosh?
- Mm-hmm.
He just moved here.
- Apparently loaded.
- Apparently.
I don't feel good about being here.
People may get the wrong idea.
Really?
You don't feel good?
How do you think I felt when you gave away my million dollars, huh?
Juice.
See anybody that looks like him?
Oh, yeah.
He looks like him.
Uh, she looks like him right there.
Way back over there, uh, there goes his little twin brother.
You give me one picture and expect me to find him out of all these kids?
You must be crazy.
I'm gonna get on the water slide.
I'm startin' to sweat.
Hey, mister, you know where the refreshment stands are?
- [Pops Balloon]
- No.
[Girl Crying]
Boom, boom, boom!
I got you!
Boom, boom, boom, boom!
[Electronic Gunfire]
- [Butch Whimpering]
- He says he knows you, boss.
Oh, well, just throw him out.
[Screaming] Ow!
Ow!
- Banzai!
- "I want candy"
- [Preston Screaming] - "I want candy"
"Hey"
"Hey"
- "Hey"
- Hiya.
I didn't expect to see you here.
- Oh, what you doin' here?
- I came by to see Mr Macintosh.
- Oh, no, he's in a meeting.
- That's okay, I'll wait.
I just really need to see him.
- He's in meetings all day.
- All day?
- Swamped.
- Hey, I missed you at the bank.
I thought you were gonna come by and see me about opening up an account.
- Oh, I had to work.
- Wow.
This is where you work?
- Not too shabby.
- Comfortable.
- I brought an application.
- Do you still want to open up an account with me?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Do you have your deposit?
- I'll go get it.
Okay.
Great.
[Preston Screaming]
- Whoa!
- That's amazing!
Sorry, just printed it.
Two hundred dollars.
Looks like you fell into some money, huh?
- I make a living.
- Yeah, well, I guess Mr Macintosh...
He knows a good man when he sees one.
- Will he be opening up an account with us?
- Uh, maybe.
Yeah?
Great.
You know, I'd love to meet him.
How's tonight?
- Uh, tonight.
What's tonight?
- Tonight's Wednesday.
Wednesday.
Wednesday.
I'm sorry, he's busy.
- Too bad.
- Uh, but I'm not.
Oh, I handle all his financial affairs.
- You do?
- Not all of them, but I can tell you a lot about him, sort of like a pre-meeting.
- And he wouldn't mind?
- Hasn't complained yet.
Okay.
I'll come by around 8:00.
Okay.
Wait, I could send a car for you.
Okay.
Cool.
It's a date then.
Bye-bye.
A date?
A date?
I've never been on a date.
You know what they call me downtown?
The Babe-Meister.
Think about it.
Okay, I'm gonna tell you about the real deal on dating, which I know.
First of all, women love a great body.
They love...
Look at this bod.
- Whoa.
See?
- Yeah, yeah.
Of course, you've got a bod now that's of a Greek god.
Really.
Think about it.
Women like you to have a good bod because they want to feel they're protected.
You might have to fight some guy, you know?
But not with those arms.
You don't want to hit a guy with those arms 'cause those pythons would take a guy's head off.
Seriously.
You're buff, but we're gonna get you chiseled.
Okay?
Oh, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm having a vision here of a date.
- The perfect date for you guys.
- Uh, Steak Heaven!
Ho, ho!
My little friend, you really have the hots for this one, huh?
You know, if you really want to go upscale, that all-you-can-eat salad bar...
women love that.
And take some with you.
You know, line your pockets with plastic bags.
Put the food in there. 'Cause it doesn't say "All you can eat here."
Does it say "here" on the sign?
I don't think so.
So you take something back for later.
A little snackaroo.
Oh, women love that.
You get home and you got a pocketful of hot wings.
There's nothing more that impresses a woman.
Get yourself some flowers.
Get yourself a great body, some nice hair, some good clothes, a car, and learn to say words like "noncommittal."
You are a date and a half, pal.
"There he is Some Tiny Tim"
"There he is Six foot and risin'"
"Ooh, there he is He's a knockout machine"
- "He's number one He's double cool"
- Yeah!
"He's the naked truth in magazines"
- "I believe in him" - "Wonderman"
- "He is a Mr Wonderman" - "Wonderman"
"He is a Mr Wonderman"
"Ah, yes"
- "Wonderman"
- Ew.
- "Wonderman"
- One more!
Yes, yes, yes!
Ah!
[Preston] Hey, I'm gonna get you!
[Henry] You are little sushi man.
Sushi man down.
Big boy throw.
Then they chase around.
Come around other way, fall down.
Splat.
- [Preston Screaming] - " Here comes the wonderman He'd like to say bye-bye"
- Why are you dressed like a game show host?
- I'm going out tonight.
Just a minute, young man.
You're still grounded.
- But it's for Mr Macintosh.
- I don't care.
Macintosh may have a pile of money, but he doesn't decide... when my son is or isn't grounded.
- But it's for my job.
- Your job is to be grounded.
- [Both] Grounded.
- So much for Plan 442.
What do you know about Plan 442?
Well, it's the investment plan you've been working on, your "prespectus."
Prospectus.
What are you doing going through my work?
Well, I didn't want to say it, but I told Mr Macintosh... about your Plan 442, and he was very, very interested.
Yep, I promised him I'd bring a copy of it tonight and show it to him.
But I didn't want to tell you just in case you got your hopes all up and...
No, no, no, no, no, of course not.
Let me get you a fresh copy of the "prespectus."
- I'll get a copy of it, sweetheart.
- Prospectus.
Yeah.
- Here.
You're welcome.
- Oh, thank you.
Hurry up.
Go.
Go!
You want the car keys?
Nah, that's okay, Dad.
I don't drive yet.
- [Dad] You want me to drive you?
- [Preston] No, it's okay.
You know, I still haven't met Macintosh.
Maybe I should go over and...
- No!
You'll ruin everything.
- Why not?
He has a date tonight and he's very nervous about it.
- I guess I can see him first thing in the morning.
- Oh, I don't know, Dad.
I mean, he might be up pretty late with this woman.
[Chuckles] Lucky dog.
Later, toads.
- [Groaning]
- Thank you.
That's enough.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
I can't believe Mr Macintosh went to all this trouble.
- This place is great.
- Mr Macintosh has been eating here for years.
Oh, yeah?
I thought he just moved here.
There was a Tangerino where I used to live.
Oh.
[Gargling]
Compliments of the chef for Mr Waters... and his lovely guest.
Th-They look like lobsters, only weenie.
Oh.
Mr Macintosh wanted you to have this too.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, wow.
This is beautiful.
Oh.
But I can't accept this from you.
But it's from Mr Macintosh.
- Why?
- Just a little business gift.
I mean, it's deductible, isn't it?
I'm not really sure, but it's way too expensive.
Mr Macintosh has a million dollars.
A million dollars doesn't buy all that much these days.
Do you think he should have asked for more?
What exactly does he do anyway?
Oh, a little of this, a little of that.
- You know.
- No, I'm afraid I don't.
- Oh, well...
- Is he an entrepreneur?
No, he's American.
Very secretive.
He has some questions for you too.
Okay.
Shoot.
- "Are you married?"
- No.
"What's the shortest guy you ever dated?"
Mmm.
I'm not really sure.
- "The youngest?"
- You know, these are pretty personal questions.
Well, Mr Macintosh is very interested in you.
- He is?
- He's, uh, never met anybody like you before.
He's never met me before, period.
Technically no, but he's been thinking a lot about you lately.
- He has?
- Yep.
Whoa!
Preston!
Are you okay?
- [Screaming] - [Gasps]
Do you like hamburgers?
I love hamburgers.
Never saw this kid before in my life.
This is a waste of time.
Come on.
What's so special about this place?
- You'll see.
- Mmm, come on.
Tell me.
- Okay.
- You gonna tell me?
- Come with me.
- All right.
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.
- See what?
- Okay, get in the middle.
- Okay, ready?
Five, four, three,
- Here?
Two, one.
[Shay Laughing] Holy smokes!
Okay!
Okay, now, come here, Shay!
- Okay, okay, now!
- Preston, I don't believe this!
Okay, now, let's run around!
- Don't get wet!
- Get us out!
Run!
[Screams]
- Okay, okay, okay!
- Watch out!
- No, we're gonna get soaked!
- No, no, no.
Now come...
Come around here!
Come around here!
Come on!
- Okay, hold onto me.
- [Screaming] Hey, where are you?
[Screaming] Yeah!
Yes!
- Whoo, yeah!
- Preston!
[Clapping, Cheering]
This is a great idea, Biderman.
Where's all the kids, huh?
Carl, it's late at night.
All the little boys and girls are tucked in bed.
What do you expect?
What I expect is when I give someone a million dollars, and I come back a day later,
I find the million dollars.
That's what I expect.
- Carl, I'm not a magician.
- You can make it disappear,
- you just can't get it back, right?
- I'm telling you...
If y'all want a kid so bad, there go one over there.
[Biderman] That's the little boy from the bank!
Shh.
Shh.
- [Preston Screams]
- Go get him!
- Oh, I'll race ya to the limo!
I'll race ya to the limo!
- What?
Okay, I'll race ya!
[Shouting]
[Screaming]
- I got the door for ya!
- Open the door.
It's freezing!
Go, Henry!
Go, Henry, go!
- [Henry] Here we go!
- [Groaning]
He got away again!
I don't believe this!
He got away again!
[Screaming]
[Shay] This was the most fun.
- I haven't done anything like this since I was a little kid.
- Me neither.
Thank you so much.
When can I see you again?
Well, I really have to spend some time with my job right now.
Well, uh, I'm having a party.
On Friday.
Can you come?
It's for Mr Macintosh.
Um, it could be for your business, sort of.
Mr Macintosh will really be there?
Uh-huh.
It's his birthday.
Okay.
Well, great.
It's a date then.
Oh, I'm getting out up here.
It was really fun.
And, uh,
- I had such a good time.
- Me too.
- Good night, Preston.
- Good night, Shay.
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.
- Good night, ma'am.
Bye now.
It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.
[Henry] So you're having a party Friday?
[Preston] Oh, yeah, it's Mr Macintosh's birthday.
Oh, I thought you said it was your birthday Friday.
Well, we're gonna have a joint party for the both of us.
Oh.
Well, it's a good thing it worked out your birthdays are around the same time.
Hey, you wanna move that horse?
Come on.
What is this, Bonanza?
Let's go!
Well, here we are.
Home at last.
- Thanks, Henry.
- My pleasure.
Hey!
Preston Waters!
- Good night.
- You know what you got, pal?
- What?
- S-T-Y-L-E.
- Style.
Good night, Henry.
- Style.
Good night.
Take it easy, man.
Good night.
Macintosh and I are having the biggest birthday party ever.
- Honey, where's Preston?
- He's working for Macintosh.
Oh.
Where's Damien and Ralph?
They're working for Macintosh too.
Oh.
- Have you met Macintosh?
- No, I thought you met him.
- No, I haven't met him.
- Well, I haven't met him either.
[Machine Humming]
Keep 'em comin'.
Mr Macintosh wants me to get plenty of practise.
[Screams] Watch where you're hittin' those!
Quit messin' around.
Macintosh is watching.
Where?
We've still never seen him.
Just get back to work.
He's watching.
- " [Loud Rock] - [Man]... coming out of the garage.
Ruining the neighbourhood.
"[Continues]
[Shooting Noises]
[Henry] Hey, Preston!
Your party planner's here again.
[Woman] Piston!
Piston!
Piston!
Turn off this contraption.
I have wonderful news.
Mr Macintosh's birthday is going to be the event of the century.
We gonna make the front page from coast to coast.
Oh, we are so lucky, lucky, lucky!
Now what kind of food does Mr Macintosh like?
- I don't know.
- And who are his friends?
- Do you have a guest list?
- Uh, I don't think so.
You know, dewdrop, I think I should meet him because...
I'm gonna need a little cash deposit.
Oh.
Uh, here.
Let me get you some cash.
Ooh, yes, you do have money, don't you?
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Careful walking around with this much money, darling.
Somebody could just rip you right off.
Now, this first $10,000 is going to be the deposit.
Now, of course, I'll get the balance at the party, and Mr Macintosh is good for it?
I am just so looking forward to meeting him.
- Who isn't?
- Waiters, security,
- guest list, paparazzi...
- Oh, and Yvonne?
- Yes?
- Remember, it's Preston.
Whatever!
Hey, uh, hey, Henry.
[Grunting, Laughing] It's attack of the 50-foot chauffeur from hell!
I was just wondering if you wanted to play some video games.
Oh, man, I wish you'd have said something.
I can't.
I promised some friends I was gonna meet 'em in a while.
Oh, okay.
No problem.
I'll tell you what.
I'll drop you over at one of your friend's place... on the way over, and you can have some fun there.
Nah.
Maybe I'll go to the park.
All right.
It's up to you.
Hey, Preston,
- is my tie straight?
- Well, it looks perfect.
All right.
Later.
- Over here.
- Over here!
There it is.
That's the park up ahead.
Where did all these kids come from?
Keep driving and maybe someday I'll tell you.
- How could you hit a kid?
- I didn't hit a kid.
I ran over his bicycle.
I had a dog once that got hit by a train.
- Thanks for sharing, Juice.
- Old King Cole we called him.
- He was a merry old soul.
- It's him.
- Boy with the backpack.
- Go!
Go!
Go!
- The sign says "No Cars Allowed"!
- Just drive!
Quigley!
- You're gonna pay for this!
- Just drive!
- Carl, this isn't a good idea.
- Shut up!
Whoa!
Let go, man.
What's goin' on?
- Oooh!
- Oooh!
- I'm gonna get him.
- We're gonna tear him up!
- Reach over there and get him!
- Your butt is mine, kid!
I've been wantin' this little punk.
I own you!
I own you, kid!
Come here!
He's got my money!
Aaaah!
- Follow him on foot!
Go!
- Follow him on foot?
- Do I look like a bloodhound, a professional tracker?
- Juicy, listen.
If we don't get that kid, nobody gets paid.
[Groaning]
- I want cash benefits, dental, everything.
- Not a problem.
Insurance!
Here, kiddie, kiddie!
Oh, there you go.
Come here, boy.
I'm gonna get you now.
I've been lookin' for you!
Huh?
Oh, no.
There he goes.
Yes.
Come here, boy!
I'm gonna get you now!
Aaaah!
Don't believe this!
Kill that kid when I find him.
I'm not gettin' paid for this.
- Where are we going now?
My hands are over my eyes.
- Shut up!
- Get out...
- [Screaming]
There he is!
Stick with it!
I got ya!
[Juice] I'll get you!
Hang on, hang on.
- Okay, there he is!
- Come here!
Come here!
- Juice!
Run after him.
- You must be crazy.
You run after him.
- Just ran through this whole entire park.
- Fine, get in the car.
- [Coughing]
- Don't blow chunks in my car.
I just had it detailed.
- I'm cool!
- Are you sure?
Are you sure?
- I'm not gonna mess up your priceless detail.
- Come on.
- [Retching]
- Hey!
[Boy] Wow, what's this?
- Let's go!
- After him!
- Hey, dude!
- [Juice] Move outta the way.
Sorry!
- Get 'im!
- Your butt is mine!
I want this kid...
What are you doing?
- Yeah!
- No!
Carl, watch out!
[Juice] Oh, no!
Whoa!
- Aah!
No!
- Oh, man!
Yes!
Now that's a display of fine driving right there.
You know, Carl, it might be easier just to steal another million dollars.
Hello, Mr Jackson.
Well, well, well, if it isn't the world's youngest personal injury attorney.
You know, you're in a lot of trouble today, little man.
Yeah, 'cause today I have been drinking vodka.
- Take a hike, butt-brain.
- What?
- Take a...
- Never mind, never mind.
Never mind, never mind!
[Chattering]
[Yvonne] Antoine, get that truck thing off the stage.
Thank you!
Get those golden gloves off!
Thank you!
Love, love, love, love!
What do you think?
Ta-da!
Is this to die, or what?
Uh, yeah, sure, it's, uh, to die.
I can't wait to show it to Mr Macintosh.
Come on, honey, let's see what they did with that...
"Is it to die for or what?" [Laughing]
Where did you find her?
Oh, man.
- What does this cost?
- I don't know.
- What do you think it should cost?
- Lots, lots.
Kid, why don't you just tell me what I need to know.
I'm a good guy.
Okay, how good are you going to be to me?
In round numbers.
I don't think you get the picture, sonny.
- Maybe you need a better view.
- [Screaming]
[Screaming] Preston Waters, 1508 Oak Street, Hillsdale, Indiana!
- Thank you.
- [Crying]
- You all right?
- Aaah!
Aaah!
- Is something wrong?
- No, not at all.
- Is Mr Macintosh around?
- Uh, no.
- But he will be here tonight?
- Yeah.
- In person?
- In person.
- Okay.
I'll see you tonight?
- Okay.
Okay.
You're looking good.
Bye.
- I'll be calling.
- What a babe.
Baby brother comes into his own.
For a little weasel, he sure knows how to get a girlfriend.
- Too bad he picked a fortune hunter.
- Little love pilot... shot down in flames by a gold digger.
By a what?
Gold digger, someone who is only after money.
I know women, and that one is after Macintosh's cold, hard cash.
For your information, me and Shay already went on a date... and she had one fantastic time, boys.
Oh, yes, every second she was getting closer...
- and closer to Mr Macintosh.
- [Laughing]
- Shut up!
- Just answer me this.
Did she ever, ever just once, come by without saying,
"Meanwhile, I wonder if I could see Mr Macintosh?"
She's a gold digger, man.
She just wants Macintosh's money.
- Yeah!
Ow!
- Don't rub it.
Be a man.
- Don't rub it.
- I'll rub it if I want to.
- She wants a guy with money, not some little kid with an empty piggy bank.
- Yeah.
"Well, I'll wait by the windows I'll wait by the door"
"To make sure you don't come home"
- You ever known any gold diggers?
- Man, have I.
I hate 'em.
They're the worst.
Anybody who is your friend because you have money is not your friend at all.
You know what they say about gold?
"He who has the gold makes the rules"?
No, no, no.
"A fool and his gold are soon parted."
What does that mean?
"A fool and his gold are soon parted." Those old sayings, man,
I don't get 'em.
I don't even know really what that means.
You ever heard:
"More than one way to skin a cat"?
Who skins cats?
Why would you skin a cat?
And there is not more than one way to skin a cat.
There is only one way.
You grab the cat, you rip the skin off the cat.
What is the number two way?
You put a hose up the cat's butt?
He gets so bloated that he skins himself?
Does he have a piece of Velcro under his butt?
No.
"Kill two birds with one stone." You heard that one?
You know anyone who has even killed one bird with one stone?
Kids try it all the time.
You can't hit a bird with a stone.
Unless you got a huge stone and they're tiny baby birds.
Then... [lmitating Crash] Beep, beep!
Dead.
[Sighing] "A fool and his gold are soon parted."
I guess it means that if you're a fool, your gold or your money is soon gone.
Once it's gone, it is outta there.
It is history.
It is dust.
It is vapour.
It is no more.
You are living in Brokesville.
- Unless you have Macintosh's kind of money.
- What if you don't?
I guess then you find out who your real friends are.
Man, we look good.
- Is everybody having a good time?
- [Woman Laughing]
- Good, you are.
- "Yes, we are, darling." Wow, look at the balloons.
- This is great.
Look at the ice sculpture.
- Presents!
Hey, hey, hey, kid, no touching.
Those are Mr Macintosh's.
Go find your parents.
Go on, get outta here.
Go on!
- I just want to see Mr Macintosh.
- I just want to pig out.
[Chuckling] Hey, look at that.
Excuse me.
- Sorry!
- Exactly who are you looking for, Preston?
- Have you seen Shay?
- I haven't seen her, but she'll be around.
Come on...
Oh, man, look at all this food!
Macintosh doesn't show, we bring the kid in, agreed?
If Preston says Macintosh is gonna be there, Macintosh will be there.
But you don't make a move, until I give you the signal, understood?
We got eight men ready to go in and nail him the second he shows up!
We close this deal tonight!
Where's the pizza and the ice cream?
What's going on here?
This could have been a pizza before it got run over by a couple of trucks.
Oh, that looks tasty.
Looks like something you'd find between your toes.
Ah, ah, ah!
It's sucking the life outta me!
- Shut up!
Everybody's looking.
- So what?
Who cares?
Relax, have a good time.
She'll show up.
Oh, there's Shay now.
Ha!
Just kidding.
I was kidding ya!
Would you just relax?
She'll be here.
It's not at all what you thought it'd be like?
Hate being rich, huh?
Preston?
Preston?
Ice cream, ice cream.
Yoo-hoo, Preston!
Now, where is our mystery man?
It's time for Mr Macintosh to make his appearance.
I like to give my employers their bills directly.
That way if they have any questions or heart attacks or something...
- I'll give it to him.
- Fine.
Be quick about it.
$100,000?
Sweetheart, I know this seems like a whole lot of money to normal people like me and you, but to a man like Macintosh this is just pennies.
- Now, you get up there and get me my money!
- Ow!
I'll get your money.
[Computer Beeping]
Party: $100,000.
Not a problem.
You can leave it.
This is fine.
I'll be right back.
Thank you.
[Computer] Transaction not possible.
Insufficient funds.
Current balance: $332.17.
- Transaction not possible.
- Three hundred dollars?
- Insufficient funds.
Transaction not possible.
- Oh, no!
- No, please, God.
- Insufficient funds.
This can't be right.
One, two, three, four...
[Chattering]
It's gone.
It's all gone.
[Knocking]
Mr Macintosh?
Oh, sorry to bother you.
It's Fred Waters, Preston's dad.
I know you got a bash going on here, so I'll make it brief.
But, uh,
I wanted to ask you a favour.
You see, today is Preston's birthday and if you see him, if you could send him home a little early.
Lately he's been working so hard.
All of a sudden money's become so important to him.
I guess that's mostly my fault.
You don't have kids, do you, Mr Macintosh?
I'll tell you, it's very easy to make mistakes with them.
I haven't always paid enough attention to my kids.
I pushed them too hard... maybe.
Especially Preston.
I guess I expect more from him.
He reminds me of myself at that age.
I couldn't wait to grow up.
I'm afraid he's missing out on his childhood.
So am I.
Well, thanks.
I won't take up any more of your time.
And we appreciate you sending Preston home early.
If...
If he wants to come, that is.
- [Whispering] I want to come home.
- Thanks.
Dad.
Dad?
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad, wait!
Daddy!
Henry?
Henry!
Wait a minute, where's Henry?
Your driver?
He left a little while ago.
H-He left?
You sure it was Henry?
Big guy, white limo.
He's gone.
Thanks.
Now I know who my friends are.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
- [Door Opening] - [Shay] Preston?
Mr Macintosh?
- Mr Macintosh?
- It's just me.
- Which one of us did you want?
- I was looking for you.
- Oh, good.
- And Mr Macintosh.
Look, it's very, very important that I find Mr Macintosh right now.
- Do you understand?
- He's nowhere.
- He's gone.
I think you'd better leave too.
- Preston...
- you could be in danger.
- Just go, okay?
You got your necklace.
Just take it and leave.
"Give it back There's no time to lose"
"So give it back Give it back"
Riggs?
Riggs?
Riggs?
Looks like no one's home.
- Shut up, Wienerman.
- Biderman.
- Where is he?
- I don't know, but he might be down the street... at Mr Macintosh's, that's his boss.
- Macintosh.
Come on!
- [Whimpering]
You know, I do like what they have done with this colour.
There you are, puppy-butt.
Did you get me my money?
- Uh, Macintosh has disappeared.
- What?
Now, I am warning you, Tom Thumb, don't you trifle with me.
If I don't get paid, I will sue Mr Macintosh... for every dime he is worth!
Well, be sure and tell me when you find him.
Okay, little Mr Man, this party is over!
Quiet!
Stop that playing!
Stop that music!
Quiet!
Attention!
Attention!
Everybody, this party is over!
Our host...
can't pay his bills!
- Mr Macintosh is a fraud!
- [Woman] What?
[Crowd Murmuring] Who's that kid?
She's right.
Hate to tell you this, but there's been a terrible mistake.
Nobody s-should have been invited.
Macintosh is... is gone.
And he's not coming back.
So I think you should all leave too, so go.
Go on.
Close down the bar!
Come on, let's get outta here.
Come on, Antoine.
Move it!
Come on, move it!
Come back with those glasses!
Give me that!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
[Knocking]
Henry?
Henry!
I knew you'd come back!
Henry...
[Gasping]
Happy birthday.
I'm here to blow out your candles.
- Oh!
Let me go!
- What's your hurry, kid?
Got a big cheque to cash?
- Let me go!
- I like this pad.
What do you think, Juice?
Oh, yeah, I like the pad.
It looks real nice.
- Can you handle it?
Got the TV, drums.
- Oh, I like this.
- TV, drums.
- All kinds of toys.
- He's got a little taste, a little flavour.
- What's this thing here?
- I don't think I've seen one of those before.
- How do you work this?
Well, you turn the knob...
You really shouldn't let him in such a nice house as this.
All your stuff could get broken.
Kid, where's Macintosh?
N-Nowhere.
He's nowhere.
I'm going to ask you one more time.
Where is he?
Huh!
There is no Macintosh.
- I made him up.
It was me the whole time.
- Don't give me that.
- Who bought this house?
- I-I did.
You?
You outbid me?
Wait a minute.
You tryin' to tell me that this little boy here... outbid you with your own money?
Be a fly on the wall, okay, Juice?
Listen, kid, you know it's illegal to take things that don't belong to you.
I know.
I feel awful.
Take me to the police.
- Carl, don't do it.
It's a trick.
- Get outta here.
Son, I don't want to take you to the police.
Just tell me, okay?
Where's my money?
I-I spent it.
- All of it?
- All of it.
How could you spend... a million dollars in six days?
You must not have been shopping lately.
Carl, Carl, wait a minute.
Maybe we're thinking about this Macintosh thing in the wrong way.
- What are you talking about?
- You needed a new house, a new identity.
This kid, he's done it for you.
I mean, Macintosh could run for mayor here.
Yeah, I kind of like the idea of that...
Mayor Quigley.
No, no, Mayor Macintosh.
I like it.
Look, there's only one problem with that.
The...
Aaah!
- Hey!
- Come back here!
- Wait for me!
I'm coming!
- He's upstairs, man!
Break it down!
Break it down!
There he is!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
- He went down there!
- Juice, go after him!
- I ain't goin' down there.
- Go on!
Now!
- You're crazy.
I ain't goin' down there.
- Watch your head.
- What is it, about 230...
Whoa!
- Aaah!
- I'm not goin' in there.
- Oh, no, he didn't.
- Did you see him?
- Oh, no, you did just push me in the pool!
- Get out, we gotta find him!
What?
What happened?
Act like you got a purpose in life.
Go.
[Biderman] I think I'm experiencing chest pains.
[Indistinct Noise]
Carl?
Juice?
Huh?
Oh.
Little boy?
Little boy from the bank?
Ha, ha.
Oh!
[Groaning, Grunting]
Where am I?
Oh-oh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
[Sheep Bleating, Cow Mooing]
[Muttering]
[Rooster Crowing]
- Hey, hey!
- [Cow Mooing]
Got ya!
Uh-huh!
- Hey!
- Got him.
It's time for a little batting practise.
Here we go!
Hey!
What's happening?
Whoa!
Hey!
Just outside.
Let's try a sinker.
A sinker!
Another!
Another!
Let's try a screwball!
- Turn, turn, turn!
- Be cool!
Ow!
Hey!
Ho!
Come on, boy!
Screwball!
Boom!
Whoa!
Oooh!
- That must have hurt!
- My god!
Fastball, fastball!
Just inside!
- Oooh!
Ow!
- What's next, Juice?
How about tennis?
It's over, kid.
Ow!
Ow!
Preston, come out, come out, wherever you are.
None of this would have happened, you know, if you hadn't been a bad boy!
Tell me something, did you think you were going to get away with it?
Spending somebody else's hard-earned money?
Huh!
We need to have a chat.
Preston...
I'm not mad any more.
I know you're sorry.
Come on, buddy.
Pres?
Come on out now!
Banzai!
Quigley, I'll be back in a minute.
Don't leave me here...
Oh, where am I goin'?
- Whoa!
Kid!
- Don't you move.
Juice!
Biderman!
Get your useless butt over here!
[Motor Revving, Tyres Screeching]
Whoa!
Oh!
Oh!
Kid!
Kid!
What are you doin'?
Oh!
Oh!
Kid, kid, stop, please, please!
Stop!
Oh!
[Groaning]
Kid, please!
Don't do that!
Ooooh!
[Screaming]
Quigley?
Are you okay?
Aaah!
I got you now!
Come get him!
I got him now.
Come get him, you guys.
All right, hold him.
- Baseballs!
- You're not a very nice boy, you know that?
- Freeze!
- Preston, are you okay?
What's this all about?
What's happening here?
Stanley?
What are you doing here?
- Let go!
- As of this moment, you're fired from my bank!
F.B.I., Biderman.
From this moment, you're fired from your bank.
- What?
- You're with the F.B.I.?
- Yes, Preston, I am.
- Okay, kid, finally, at long last, who's Macintosh?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...
- I'm Macintosh.
- You're Macintosh?
I'm Macintosh!
And I want you all off my property now!
- He's Macintosh.
- You sure?
I tell ya, I'm Macintosh!
Please tell these guys I'm Macintosh.
- Oh, he's Macintosh.
Don't you know Papa Macintosh?
- Mr Macintosh.
And Big Mama Macintosh be hangin' out with the brothers.
Mr Macintosh, you're under arrest for fraud, money laundering and grand theft.
- What are you talking about?
- Bring in Biderman too.
- I'm a banker!
- And take Mr Wise Guy too.
- Who?
Me?
I'm not wise.
- Get your hands off me.
- Man, I flunked recess.
- Take it easy, man.
- Take 'em out.
- I'm not even from here, man.
- I'm a banker.
- I was roaming down the street.
Cat said, Hey, there's a party.
- I own a bank!
Sir, stay behind the line there.
Everyone, just calm down, okay?
Honey, I'm gonna check this out, make sure that Preston's okay.
- You take the boys home.
- [Chattering]
- What's going on?
- Something to do with Macintosh.
The F.B.I. Is all over.
- Uh, have you seen my son, a little boy?
- He's inside with the F.B.I.
- Excuse me, excuse me, please.
Officer...
- Whoa, whoa!
- Nobody gets in there without a badge, sir.
- I'm looking for my son.
Kind of neat.
Can I see your badge?
Shay Stanley, F.B.I.
Cool.
Wait a minute.
So that means our date... was just for your...
just for your job?
Well, it started out like that.
I should have known.
Hey, you know, I wouldn't have traded that night for anything.
So when can I see you again, Shay?
Mmm, why don't you give me a call in, say, about ten years?
- Five.
- Seven.
- Six.
- Okay, it's a date.
Good night, Preston.
[Dad] Preston!
Preston?
Oh, my god, he's in shock.
Oh, oh, I'm fine, Dad.
I'm fine now.
Oh, I'm glad to see you.
- What's going on here?
- It's a long story.
- Well, why don't we go on home, you tell me all about it?
- Okay.
I want to say goodbye to a friend, okay, Dad?
Wow, this is just great.
I can't step out for a couple of seconds.
I miss all the action.
Thanks.
- Are you okay?
- I thought you left, man.
No, I didn't leave.
What did we say the party needed?
Ice cream, right?
I just went to get ice cream.
I don't know if I got the exact recipe, but I think I got it close.
- So?
- Hey, it's pretty close.
Well, I guess Macintosh is no more, huh?
It's too bad, because, uh, I really enjoyed working for him.
- I had a good time too...
- Do me a favour?
Next time you see him, tell him, uh, that I'm really gonna miss him.
I'll miss you too, Henry.
You're gonna do just fine.
See ya.
- Hey, Henry.
- Huh?
- Know what you have?
- What?
- S-T-Y-L-E, style.
- Style.
Hey, Preston, you're not gonna finish this ice cream, I guess, huh?
Well, no sense letting' this go to waste.
So, what happened?
Oh, well, uh, Macintosh wasn't...
He...
He wasn't who he thought he was.
- How do you mean?
- Well, he shouldn't have done what he did.
He shouldn't have fooled everybody.
I think you're right.
It's been a long night.
Better get on up to bed.
Yeah, I think I ought to get some sleep too, Dad.
And tomorrow, I'll tell you all about Mr Macintosh.
Sleep well, Preston.
[Group] Ta-da!
"Happy birthday to you"
"Happy birthday dear Preston"
"Happy birthday to you"
Make a wish.
You know what they say, "Be careful what you wish for."
Oh.
What else do I want?
I mean, I got everything... that I need right here.
On the other hand.

[ panting ]
[ thunder rumbling ]
[ grunting ]
Where are you ?
Oh.
Hello, beautiful.
[ kissing sound ]
Did you miss me ?
Dad, I've given this some thought...
And I've decided that since damien and ralph have their own rooms,
Well, there's no reason why they should be bringing their junk into my room.
Well, how does that sound, helen ?
- [ gulping ] - [ door opening ]
Out of the way, stick boy !
Hand foot is here to stay.
Oops, kicked your baby monkey.
Get out of here, ralph !
Here, take this.
Go away, damien.
This is my room.
Was.
Now it's also the world headquarters of hand foot, incorporated.
Hand foot all the way !
Hand foot, hand foot, hand foot !
- Hand foot ?
You guys aren't gonna make a dime.
- Okay, we'll use this.
Yeah !
Hey, that's my life savings !
Consider yourself our silent partner.
Yeah, say something and you're dead.
Yeah.
How's the big move going ?
Great.
Good.
Come on, ralph.
Gotta get to work.
Dad ?
[ clears throat ]
Dad...
Well, I've given this a lot of thought,
And I've decided that...
S-s-since damien and ralph have their own room-- preston,
They need the space for their business.
Not my space.
Young man, in this family, industry gets rewarded.
While you're in here playing, your brothers are hard at work.
Yeah, kissing' butt for money.
[ ralph ] well, you know the golden rule.
He who has the gold makes the rules.
One day you'll have a job.
When I was your age, I had my own business cleaning wheels.
[ mimicking dad ]
I was pulling down 100 bucks a week polishing cars.
You used to say 75.
Well, you gotta think big, preston.
Surprise.
[ brothers ] whoa, check it out.
Yeah, it's for your business.
We had a spare at the office.
Damien, the speakers are out in the hall.
How does it work ?
It imitates human intelligence, like you guys.
- Preston, maybe you could teach your brothers how to use it.
- Not possible.
[ dad ] the software will teach you how to do everything but make love to a woman.
Now I know what program to get your father for christmas.
Mom !
Oops !
Uh, here.
Let me help you with that.
Preston, you're gonna be late...
- For butch's birthday party.
- Who wants to celebrate butch's birth ?
- [ dad ] it's important to get out of your room more.
- [ brothers ] our room.
Well, good luck, guys.
[ computer beeps, talks ] damien and ralph sleep...
Butt to face, butt to face,
Butt to face, huh ?
Who said that ?
Butt to face, butt to face, type "quit." hit "delete."
Butt to face, butt to face, butt to face-- turn it off !
Pull the plug !
Ow !
Don't rub it.
Be a man.
[ moaning ] ouch !
Little wimp.
[ dad ] come on, preston.
You don't want to be late for butch's birthday party.
Are you gonna have fun today ?
[ preston ] how can I, dad ?
I don't have any money.
Now, look.
Here's a couple of bucks.
Ah, heck, you can have fun all day on that.
You don't get out much, do you, dad ?
[ p.A. ] welcome to fun land.
Fun, fun, fun for everyone.
Welcome to fun land.
Fun, fun, fun for everyone.
Hey.
Hey, man.
Hey, butch.
Hey, man.
Yeah !
Hey, what's up ?
Oh, look.
It's presto the pesto.
Hello, butch.
[ kids laughing ]
Oh !
- Tokens !
- [ kids cheering ]
- Give me 50.
It's my birthday.
- Fifty.
- Twenty-five, please.
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-seven.
- Twenty-seven.
- Six, please.
- Six.
Six.
Coming ?
I don't know.
[ screaming ] [ screaming ]
[ screaming ]
[ shouting ] it's gonna be awesome !
Yeah, let's go over here !
This one !
Hurry !
[ butch ] hey, preston !
Hey, over here !
Hey, preston, how's your ostrich ?
Watch out !
Preston has an ostrich !
Hey, preston, come with us !
- Just kidding !
- [ laughing ]
[ groaning ] [ dad ] did you have fun at butch's birthday party ?
I have a question.
Are we broke ?
No, we just have to watch our spending habits.
That's right.
Like when your mother calls her sister back east and talks for 97 minutes.
So if we're not poverty-stricken,
There must be some other reason I'm so deprived.
We're outta here !
Whoo !
Goin' to the ball game.
- Can I go ?
- We bought tickets, toad.
Damien !
You need some cash ?
Nah, we got a bunch of change.
Later, preston.
It's not fair.
Why can't I have anything ?
Well, preston, they have jobs, and they've learned to save.
How can I save money if I don't have any ?
A penny saved is a penny earned.
- What do you want for your birthday ?
- Money...
So I can pay to have ralph and damien knocked off.
Anything else ?
Well, maybe we'll give him one of his birthday presents early.
A gift came from grandma today.
Hmm.
What a rip-off !
It's a check for nothing !
I'm having a bad day.
Oh, your grandma just forgot to fill in how much it was for,
But she signed it at the bottom, see ?
It's a blank check.
We'll just fill in the amount.
How much did you get last year, honey ?
A thousand.
- Ten dollars.
- Wait, dad.
What about inflation ?
- Oh, make it 11.
- [ muttering ]
You'd be surprised how fast...
Eleven dollars can grow with interest.
Preston ?
Preston ?
[ preston ] eleven dollars...
At 3.45% interest.
[ computer ] your account will reach...
One million dollars...
In 342,506 years.
I'm stuck here forever.
[ dad ] lights out up there.
Why ?
My house, my rules.
"my house, my rules."
My own house.
[ yawning ]
[ engine stops, car door shutting ]
[ man ] dave, who needs assets ?
I'm your asset.
I'm a big asset.
Oh, c-- [ man on phone ] I can't believe you.
Dave, dave.
Come on, come on.
Why only borrow 150,000 ?
Our money is your money.
Round it off to two.
Do I qualify ?
Of course you qualify for the loan, dave.
We're golf partners.
-You don't look happy to see me.
-Quig--
- Quigley.
- Quigley.
That's funny.
I don't remember you stuttering on the witness stand.
You just sang like a bird, didn't you ?
I had no choice, carl.
I mean, lying in court-- you also pointed at me.
- That hurt.
- Well, I was under oath.
I mean-- come here.
The only reason you're alive, biderman,
Is I knew I might need you again someday...
Like today.
Oh, sure.
You need a loan ?
The rates are great now.
And you get a toaster.
I don't need a toaster.
Before I went away, I put aside a little nest egg.
[ gasping ] these bills, they're marked consecutively.
They'd trace these in a minute.
That's right.
[ coughing ] that's where you come in, old buddy.
I want new bills.
We're back in the sl business, biderman.
Ah, money laundering...
Is very difficult these days, carl.
You still do it though, don't you ?
That's a good-looking family right there.
You're not gonna hurt them, are you ?
Hate to have to.
All right.
How do you want to do this ?
I'll send my guy in tomorrow with a check for a million.
Tomorrow ?
Yep, just like the old days.
You give him the cash, unmarked, send him on his way.
Whom should I expect ?
Whom should--
Whom should you expect ?
His name is juice.
Juice ?
Mmm, he'll be here in exactly 24 hours.
Let's call it 1:00.
Come on.
Walk me out.
Show a little respect.
Whoa.
I know how you feel.
Hi.
Hi.
Can you see okay ?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, sure.
I would like to open an account, please.
Eleven dollars.
Do you have any other money you'd like to deposit, mr.
Waters ?
Oh, uh, I could,
But it's sort of hard to save around my house;
that's why I'm here.
I'm afraid we have a minimum balance.
It's $200.
Two hundred dollars ?
That could take a million years.
Well, whenever you're ready, please come back and see me.
My name's shay stanley.
Ask for me.
Okay, I'll do that.
- Thanks.
- Bye-bye.
- I-I'll see you next time.
- I hope it's not in a million years.
B-bye-bye.
[ biderman ] excuse me.
Carl, carl !
Here.
You can use these checks.
They're temporary.
Thank you, edward.
Like our relationship.
Sucker !
Give me that !
- [ laughing ] - give it to me !
Butch, give it to me !
Preston, come on !
Butch !
- Give it back !
Whoa !
- If you can catch me !
Come on, butch !
[ control panel dings, engine revs ] [ preston screams ]
- [ screaming ] - [ tires screeching ]
Perfect.
What the hell do you think you're doing ?
I-
- I--
Huh ?
[ butch ] I saw the whole thing.
I can be a witness if the price is decent.
Get outta here.
He's perfectly all right, aren't you ?
Aren't you ?
- Yes.
- Good.
Get that thing out from underneath my car.
What about my bike ?
Kid, was I the one that parked there-- oh, my word !
Are you all right ?
He's fine.
It was just a little accident.
He's okay.
- I think this guy's been drinking vodka.
- I have not been drink-- [ laughs ] I don't drink at all.
Seriously, seriously.
Kid, talk to me.
How much you want for the bike ?
- A thousand bucks.
- I'm not talking to you !
Bye, kid.
Go on.
Walk away.
What do you want, kid ?
Name a figure, we'll discuss it.
Give this to your dad.

Okay.
Well, great.
It's a date then.
Oh, I'm getting out up here.
It was really fun.
And, uh,
I had such a good time.
Me too.
Good night, preston.
Good night, shay.
See you later.
Bye-bye.
Good night, ma'am.
Bye now.
It's been a pleasure.
Thank you.
[ henry ] so you're having a party Friday ?
[ preston ] oh, yeah, it's mr.
Macintosh's birthday.
Oh, I thought you said it was your birthday Friday.
Well, we're gonna have a joint party for the both of us.
Oh.
Well, it's a good thing it worked out your birthdays are around the same time.
Hey, you wanna move that horse ?
Come on.
What is this, bonanza ?
Let's go !
Well, here we are.
Home at last.
Thanks, henry.
My pleasure.
Hey !
Preston waters !
Good night.
You know what you got, pal ?
What ?
S-t-y-l-e.
Style.
Good night, henry.
Style.
Good night.
Take it easy, man.
Good night.
Macintosh and I are having the biggest birthday party ever.
Honey, where's preston ?
He's working for macintosh.
Oh.
Where's damien and ralph ?
They're working for macintosh too.
Oh.
- Have you met macintosh ?
- No, I thought you met him.
No, I haven't met him.
Well, I haven't met him either.
[ machine humming ]
Keep 'em comin'.
Mr. Macintosh wants me to get plenty of practice.
[ screams ] watch where you're hittin' those !
Quit messin' around.
Macintosh is watching.
Where ?
We've still never seen him.
Just get back to work.
He's watching.
Ruining the neighborhood.
♪ [ continues ] [ shooting noises ] [ henry ] hey, preston !
Your party planner's here again.
[ woman ] piston !
Piston !
Piston !
Turn off this contraption.
I have wonderful news.
Mr. Macintosh's birthday is going to be the event of the century.
We gonna make the front page from coast to coast.
Oh, we are so lucky, lucky, lucky !
Now what kind of food does mr.
Macintosh like ?
I don't know.
And who are his friends ?
- Do you have a guest list ?
- Uh, I don't think so.
You know, dewdrop, I think I should meet him because...
I'm gonna need a little cash deposit.
Oh.
Uh, here.
Let me get you some cash.
Ooh, yes, you do have money, don't you ?
Wait, wait, wait.
Careful walking around with this much money, darling.
Somebody could just rip you right off.
Now, this first $10,000 is going to be the deposit.
Now, of course, I'll get the balance at the party,
And mr.
Macintosh is good for it ?
I am just so looking forward to meeting him.
- Who isn't ?
- Waiters, security,
Guest list, paparazzi-- oh, and yvonne ?
Yes ?
Remember, it's preston.
Whatever !
Hey, uh, hey, henry.
[ grunting, laughing ] it's attack of the 50-foot chauffeur from hell !
I was just wondering if you wanted to play some video games.
Oh, man, I wish you'd have said something.
I can't.
I promised some friends I was gonna meet 'em in a while.
Oh, okay.
No problem.
I'll tell you what.
I'll drop you over at one of your friend's place...
On the way over, and you can have some fun there.
Nah.
Maybe I'll go to the park.
All right.
It's up to you.
Hey, preston,
Is my tie straight ?
Well, it looks perfect.
All right.
Later.
Over here.
Over here !
There it is.
That's the park up ahead.
Where did all these kids come from ?
Keep driving and maybe someday I'll tell you.
- How could you hit a kid ?
- I didn't hit a kid.
I ran over his bicycle.
I had a dog once that got hit by a train.
Thanks for sharing, juice.
Old king cole we called him.
He was a merry old soul.
It's him.
Boy with the backpack.
Go !
Go !
Go !
The sign says "no cars allowed" !
Just drive !
Quigley !
You're gonna pay for this !
Just drive !
Carl, this isn't a good idea.
Shut up !
Whoa !
Let go, man.
What's goin' on ?
Oooh !
Oooh !
I'm gonna get him.
We're gonna tear him up !
Reach over there and get him !
Your butt is mine, kid !
I've been wantin' this little punk.
I own you !
I own you, kid !
Come here !
He's got my money !
Aaaah !
Follow him on foot !
Go !
Follow him on foot ?
Do I look like a bloodhound, a professional tracker ?
Juicy, listen.
If we don't get that kid, nobody gets paid.
[ groaning ]
I want cash benefits, dental, everything.
Not a problem.
Insurance !
Here, kiddie, kiddie !
Oh, there you go.
Come here, boy.
I'm gonna get you now.
I've been lookin' for you !
Huh ?
Oh, no.
There he goes.
Yes.
Come here, boy !
I'm gonna get you now !
Aaaah !
Don't believe this !
Kill that kid when I find him.
I'm not gettin' paid for this.
Where are we going now ?
My hands are over my eyes.
Shut up !
- Get out-- - [ screaming ]
There he is !
Stick with it !
I got ya !
[ juice ] I'll get you !
Hang on, hang on.
Okay, there he is !
Come here !
Come here !
Juice !
Run after him.
You must be crazy.
You run after him.
Just ran through this whole entire park.
Fine, get in the car.
[ coughing ] don't blow chunks in my car.
I just had it detailed.
I'm cool !
Are you sure ?
Are you sure ?
I'm not gonna mess up your priceless detail.
Come on.
[ retching ] hey !
[ boy ] wow, what's this ?
Let's go !
After him !
- Hey, dude !
- [ juice ] move outta the way.
Sorry !
Get 'im !
Your butt is mine !
I want this kid-- what are you doing ?
- Yeah !
- No !
Carl, watch out !
[ juice ] oh, no !
Whoa !
Aah !
No !
Oh, man !
Yes !
Now that's a display of fine driving right there.
You know, carl, it might be easier just to steal another million dollars.
Hello, mr.
Jackson.
Well, well, well, if it isn't the world's youngest personal injury attorney.
You know, you're in a lot of trouble today, little man.
Yeah, 'cause today I havebeen drinking vodka.
- Take a hike, butt-brain.
- What ?
Take a-- never mind, never mind.
Never mind, never mind !
[ chattering ] [ yvonne ] antoine, get that truck thing off the stage.
Thank you !
Get those golden gloves off !
Thank you !
Love, love, love, love !
What do you think ?
Ta-da !
Is this to die, or what ?
Uh, yeah, sure, it's, uh, to die.
I can't wait to show it to mr.
Macintosh.
Come on, honey, let's see what they did with that--
"is it to die for or what ?" [ laughing ]
Where did you find her ?
Oh, man.
What does this cost ?
I don't know.
What do you think it should cost ?
Lots, lots.
Kid, why don't you just tell me what I need to know.
I'm a good guy.
Okay, how good are you going to be to me ?
In round numbers.
I don't think you get the picture, sonny.
Maybe you need a better view.
[ screaming ] [ screaming ] preston waters, 1508 oak street, hillsdale, indiana !
- Thank you.
- [ crying ]
You all right ?
Aaah !
Aaah !
Is something wrong ?
No, not at all.
- Is mr.
Macintosh around ?
- Uh, no.
- But he will be here tonight ?
- Yeah.
In person ?
In person.
Okay.
I'll see you tonight ?
Okay.
Okay.
You're looking good.
Bye.
I'll be calling.
What a babe.
Baby brother comes into his own.
For a little weasel, he sure knows how to get a girlfriend.
Too bad he picked a fortune hunter.
Little love pilot...
Shot down in flames by a gold digger.
By a what ?
Gold digger, someone who is only after money.
I know women,
And that one is after macintosh's cold, hard cash.
For your information, me and shay already went on a date...
And she had one fantastic time, boys.
Oh, yes, every second she was getting closer...
And closer to mr.
Macintosh.
[ laughing ]
Shut up !
Just answer me this.
Did she ever, ever just once, come by without saying,
"meanwhile, I wonder if I could see mr.
Macintosh ?"
She's a gold digger, man.
She just wants macintosh's money.
Yeah !
Ow !
Don't rub it.
Be a man.
Don't rub it.
I'll rub it if I want to.
She wants a guy with money, not some little kid with an empty piggy bank.
Yeah.
♪ well, I'll wait by the windows I'll wait by the door ♪
♪ to make sure you don't come home ♪
You ever known any gold diggers ?
Man, have I.
I hate 'em.
They're the worst.
Anybody who is your friend because you have money is not your friend at all.
You know what they say about gold ?
"he who has the gold makes the rules" ?
No, no, no.
"a fool and his gold are soon parted."
What does that mean ?
"a fool and his gold are soon parted." those old sayings, man,
I don't get 'em.
I don't even know really what that means.
You ever heard:
"more than one way to skin a cat" ?
Who skins cats ?
Why would you skin a cat ?
And there is not more than one way to skin a cat.
There is only one way.
You grab the cat, you rip the skin off the cat.
What is the number two way ?
You put a hose up the cat's butt ?
He gets so bloated that he skins himself ?
Does he have a piece of velcro under his butt ?
No.
"kill two birds with one stone." you heard that one ?
You know anyone who has even killed one bird with one stone ?
Kids try it all the time.
You can't hit a bird with a stone.
Unless you got a huge stone and they're tiny baby birds.
Then-- [ imitating crash ] beep, beep !
Dead.
[ sighing ] "a fool and his gold are soon parted."
I guess it means that if you're a fool,
Your gold or your money is soon gone.
Once it's gone, it is outta there.
It is history.
It is dust.
It is vapor.
It is no more.
You are living in brokesville.
Unless you have macintosh's kind of money.
What if you don't ?
I guess then you find out who your real friends are.
Man, we look good.
Is everybody having a good time ?
[ woman laughing ]
Good, you are.
"yes, we are, darling." wow, look at the balloons.
This is great.
Look at the ice sculpture.
Presents !
Hey, hey, hey, kid, no touching.
Those are mr.
Macintosh's.
Go find your parents.
Go on, get outta here.
Go on !
I just want to see mr.
Macintosh.
I just want to pig out.
[ chuckling ] hey, look at that.
Excuse me.
Sorry !
Exactly who are you looking for, preston ?
Have you seen shay ?
I haven't seen her, but she'll be around.
Come on-- oh, man, look at all this food !
Macintosh doesn't show, we bring the kid in, agreed ?
If preston says macintosh is gonna be there, macintosh will be there.
But you don't make a move, until I give you the signal, understood ?
We got eight men ready to go in and nail him the second he shows up !
We close this deal tonight !
Where's the pizza and the ice cream ?
What's going on here ?
This could have been a pizza before it got run over by a couple of trucks.
Oh, that looks tasty.
Looks like something you'd find between your toes.
Ah, ah, ah !
It's sucking the life outta me !
- Shut up !
Everybody's looking.
- So what ?
Who cares ?
Relax, have a good time.
She'll show up.
Oh, there's shay now.
Ha !
Just kidding.
I was kidding ya !
Would you just relax ?
She'll be here.
It's not at all what you thought it'd be like ?
Hate being rich, huh ?
Preston ?
Preston ?
Ice cream, ice cream.
Yoo-hoo, preston !
Now, where is our mystery man ?
It's time for mr.
Macintosh to make his appearance.
I like to give my employers their bills directly.
That way if they have any questions or heart attacks or something--
I'll give it to him.
Fine.
Be quick about it.
$100,000 ?
Sweetheart, I know this seems like a whole lot of money to normal people like me and you,
But to a man like macintosh this is just pennies.
Now, you get up there and get me my money !
Ow !
I'll get your money.
[ computer beeping ]
Party: $100,000.
Not a problem.
You can leave it.
This is fine.
I'll be right back.
Thank you.

Mr. Macintosh ?
Oh, sorry to bother you.
It's fred waters, preston's dad.
I know you got a bash going on here, so I'll make it brief.
But, uh,
I wanted to ask you a favor.
You see, today is preston's birthday and if you see him,
If you could send him home a little early.
Lately he's been working so hard.
All of a sudden money's become so important to him.
I guess that's mostly my fault.
You don't have kids, do you, mr.
Macintosh ?
I'll tell you, it's very easy to make mistakes with them.
I haven't always paid enough attention to my kids.
I pushed them too hard...
Maybe.
Especially preston.
I guess I expect more from him.
He reminds me of myself at that age.
I couldn't wait to grow up.
I'm afraid he's missing out on his childhood.
So am I.
Well, thanks.
I won't take up any more of your time.
And we appreciate you sending preston home early.
If-- if he wants to come, that is.
[ whispering ] I want to come home.
Thanks.

Oh, good.
And mr.

Look, it's very, very important that I find mr.
Macintosh right now.
- Do you understand ?
- He's nowhere.
He's gone.

You know, I do like what they have done with this color.
There you are, puppy-butt.
Did you get me my money ?
Uh, macintosh has disappeared.
What ?
Now, I am warning you, tom thumb, don't you trifle with me.
If I don't get paid, I will sue mr.

She's right.
Hate to tell you this,
But there's been a terrible mistake.
Nobody s-should have been invited.
Macintosh is-- is gone.
And he's not coming back.
So I think you should all leave too, so go.
Go on.
Close down the bar !

Happy birthday.
I'm here to blow out your candles.
Oh !
Let me go !
What's your hurry, kid ?
Got a big check to cash ?
Let me go !
I like this pad.
What do you think, juice ?
Oh, yeah, I like the pad.
It looks real nice.
Can you handle it ?
Got the tv, drums.
Oh, I like this.
Tv, drums.
All kinds of toys.
He's got a little taste, a little flavor.
What's this thing here ?
- I don't think I've seen one of those before.
- How do you work this ?
Well, you turn the knob--
You really shouldn't let him in such a nice house as this.
All your stuff could get broken.
Kid, where's macintosh ?
N-nowhere.
He's nowhere.
I'm going to ask you one more time.
Where is he ?
Huh !
There is no macintosh.
I made him up.
It was me the whole time.
Don't give me that.
Who bought this house ?
I-I did.
You ?
You outbid me ?
Wait a minute.
You tryin' to tell me that this little boy here...
Outbid you with your own money ?
Be a fly on the wall, okay, juice ?
Listen, kid, you know it's illegal to take things that don't belong to you.
I know.
I feel awful.
Take me to the police.
Carl, don't do it.
It's a trick.
Get outta here.
Son, I don't want to take you to the police.
Just tell me, okay ?
Where's my money ?
I-I spent it.
- All of it ?
- All of it.
How could you spend...
A million dollars in six days ?
You must not have been shopping lately.
Carl, carl, wait a minute.
Maybe we're thinking about this macintosh thing in the wrong way.
What are you talking about ?
You needed a new house, a new identity.
This kid, he's done it for you.
I mean, macintosh could run for mayor here.
Yeah, I kind of like the idea of that-- mayor quigley.
No, no, mayor macintosh.
I like it.
Look, there's only one problem with that.
The-- aaah !
Hey !
Come back here !
Wait for me !
I'm coming !
He's upstairs, man !
Break it down !
Break it down !
There he is !
Where is he ?
Where is he ?
He went down there !
Juice, go after him !
I ain't goin' down there.
Go on !
Now !
You're crazy.
I ain't goin' down there.
Watch your head.
What is it, about 230-- whoa !
Aaah !
I'm not goin' in there.
Oh, no, he didn't.
Did you see him ?
Oh, no, you did just push me in the pool !
Get out, we gotta find him !

Don't you know papa macintosh ?
Mr. Macintosh.
And big mama macintosh be hangin' out with the brothers.
Mr. Macintosh, you're under arrest for fraud, money laundering and grand theft.
- What are you talking about ?
- Bring in biderman too.
- I'm a banker !
- And take mr.
Wise guy too.
Who ?
Me ?
I'm not wise.
Get your hands off me.
Man, I flunked recess.
Take it easy, man.
- Take 'em out.
- I'm not even from here, man.
- I'm a banker.
I was roaming down the street.
Cat said, hey, there's a party.
I own a bank !
Sir, stay behind the line there.
Everyone, just calm down, okay ?
Honey, I'm gonna check this out, make sure that preston's okay.
You take the boys home.

What's going on ?
Something to do with macintosh.
The f.B.I. Is all over.
Uh, have you seen my son, a little boy ?
He's inside with the f.B.I.
Excuse me, excuse me, please.
Officer-- whoa, whoa !
Nobody gets in there without a badge, sir.
I'm looking for my son.
Kind of neat.
Can I see your badge ?
Shay stanley, f.B.I.
Cool.
Wait a minute.
So that means our date...
Was just for your-- just for your job ?
Well, it started out like that.
I should have known.
Hey, you know, I wouldn't have traded that night for anything.
So when can I see you again, shay ?
Mmm, why don't you give me a call in, say, about ten years ?
Five.
Seven.
Six.
Okay, it's a date.
Good night, preston.
[ dad ] preston !
Preston ?
Oh, my god, he's in shock.
Oh, oh, I'm fine, dad.
I'm fine now.
Oh, I'm glad to see you.
What's going on here ?
It's a long story.
Well, why don't we go on home, you tell me all about it ?
Okay.
I want to say good-bye to a friend, okay, dad ?
Wow, this is just great.
I can't step out for a couple of seconds.
I miss all the action.
Thanks.
- Are you okay ?
- I thought you left, man.
No, I didn't leave.
What did we say the party needed ?
Ice cream, right ?
I just went to get ice cream.
I don't know if I got the exact recipe,
But I think I got it close.
So ?
Hey, it's pretty close.
Well, I guess macintosh is no more, huh ?
It's too bad, because, uh, I really enjoyed working for him.
I had a good time too-- do me a favor ?
Next time you see him,
Tell him, uh, that I'm really gonna miss him.
I'll miss you too, henry.
You're gonna do just fine.
See ya.
- Hey, henry.
- Huh ?
- Know what you have ?
- What ?
- S-t-y-l-e, style.
- Style.
Hey, preston, you're not gonna finish this ice cream, I guess, huh ?
Well, no sense letting' this go to waste.
So, what happened ?
Oh, well, uh, macintosh wasn't--
He-- he wasn't who he thought he was.
How do you mean ?
Well, he shouldn't have done what he did.
He shouldn't have fooled everybody.
I think you're right.
It's been a long night.
Better get on up to bed.
Yeah, I think I ought to get some sleep too, dad.
And tomorrow, I'll tell you all about mr.
Macintosh.
Sleep well, preston.

Where are you?
Oh.
Hello, beautiful.
Did you miss me?
Dad, I've given this some thought...
And I've decided that since damien and ralph have their own rooms,
Well, there's no reason why they should be bringing their junk into my room.
Well, how does that sound, helen?
Out of the way, stick boy!
Hand foot is here to stay.
Oops, kicked your baby monkey.
Get out of here, ralph!
Here, take this.
Go away, damien.
This is my room.
Was.
Now it's also the world headquarters of hand foot, incorporated.
Hand foot all the way!
Hand foot, hand foot, hand foot!
- Hand foot?
You guys aren't gonna make a dime.
- Okay, we'll use this.
Yeah!
Hey, that's my life savings!
Consider yourself our silent partner.
Yeah, say something and you're dead.
Yeah.
How's the big move going?
Great.
Good.
Come on, ralph.
Gotta get to work.
Dad?
Dad...
Well, I've given this a lot of thought,
And I've decided that...
S-s-since damien and ralph have their own room-- preston,
They need the space for their business.
Not my space.
Young man, in this family, industry gets rewarded.
While you're in here playing, your brothers are hard at work.
Yeah, kissing' butt for money.
well, you know the golden rule.
He who has the gold makes the rules.
One day you'll have a job.
When I was your age, I had my own business cleaning wheels.
I was pulling down 100 bucks a week polishing cars.
You used to say 75.
Well, you gotta think big, preston.
Surprise.
whoa, check it out.
Yeah, it's for your business.
We had a spare at the office.
Damien, the speakers are out in the hall.
How does it work?
It imitates human intelligence, like you guys.
- Preston, maybe you could teach your brothers how to use it.
- Not possible.
the software will teach you how to do everything but make love to a woman.
Now I know what program to get your father for christmas.
Mom!
Oops!
Uh, here.
Let me help you with that.
Preston, you're gonna be late...
- For butch's birthday party.
- Who wants to celebrate butch's birth?
it's important to get out of your room more.
- our room.
Well, good luck, guys.
damien and ralph sleep...
Butt to face, butt to face,
Butt to face, huh?
Who said that?
Butt to face, butt to face, type "quit." hit "delete."
Butt to face, butt to face, butt to face-- turn it off!
Pull the plug!
Ow!
Don't rub it.
Be a man.
ouch!
Little wimp.
come on, preston.
You don't want to be late for butch's birthday party.
Are you gonna have fun today?
how can I, dad?
I don't have any money.
Now, look.
Here's a couple of bucks.
Ah, heck, you can have fun all day on that.
You don't get out much, do you, dad?
welcome to fun land.
Fun, fun, fun for everyone.
Welcome to fun land.
Fun, fun, fun for everyone.
Hey.
Hey, man.
Hey, butch.
Hey, man.
Yeah!
Hey, what's up?
Oh, look.
It's presto the pesto.
Hello, butch.
Oh!
Tokens!
- Give me 50.
It's my birthday.
- Fifty.
- Twenty-five, please.
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-seven.
- Twenty-seven.
- Six, please.
- Six.
Six.
Coming?
I don't know.
it's gonna be awesome!
Yeah, let's go over here!
This one!
Hurry!
hey, preston!
Hey, over here!
Hey, preston, how's your ostrich?
Watch out!
Preston has an ostrich!
Hey, preston, come with us!
Just kidding!
did you have fun at butch's birthday party?
I have a question.
Are we broke?
No, we just have to watch our spending habits.
That's right.
Like when your mother calls her sister back east and talks for 97 minutes.
So if we're not poverty-stricken,
There must be some other reason I'm so deprived.
We're outta here!
Whoo!
Goin' to the ball game.
- Can I go?
- We bought tickets, toad.
Damien!
You need some cash?
Nah, we got a bunch of change.
Later, preston.
It's not fair.
Why can't I have anything?
Well, preston, they have jobs, and they've learned to save.
How can I save money if I don't have any?
A penny saved is a penny earned.
- What do you want for your birthday?
- Money...
So I can pay to have ralph and damien knocked off.
Anything else?
Well, maybe we'll give him one of his birthday presents early.
A gift came from grandma today.
Hmm.
What a rip-off!
It's a check for nothing!
I'm having a bad day.
Oh, your grandma just forgot to fill in how much it was for,
But she signed it at the bottom, see?
It's a blank check.
We'll just fill in the amount.
How much did you get last year, honey?
A thousand.
- Ten dollars.
- Wait, dad.
What about inflation?
Oh, make it 11.
You'd be surprised how fast...
Eleven dollars can grow with interest.
Preston?
Preston?
eleven dollars...
At 3.45 % interest.
your account will reach...
One million dollars...
In 342,506 years.
I'm stuck here forever.
lights out up there.
Why?
My house, my rules.
"my house, my rules."
My own house.
dave, who needs assets?
I'm your asset.
I'm a big asset.
Oh, c-- I can't believe you.
Dave, dave.
Come on, come on.
Why only borrow 150,000?
Our money is your money.
Round it off to two.
Do I qualify?
Of course you qualify for the loan, dave.
We're golf partners.
- You don't look happy to see me.
- Quig--
- Quigley.
- Quigley.
That's funny.
I don't remember you stuttering on the witness stand.
You just sang like a bird, didn't you?
I had no choice, carl.
I mean, lying in court-- you also pointed at me.
- That hurt.
- Well, I was under oath.
I mean-- come here.
The only reason you're alive, biderman,
Is I knew I might need you again someday...
Like today.
Oh, sure.
You need a loan?
The rates are great now.
And you get a toaster.
I don't need a toaster.
Before I went away, I put aside a little nest egg.
these bills, they're marked consecutively.
They'd trace these in a minute.
That's right.
that's where you come in, old buddy.
I want new bills.
We're back in the sl business, biderman.
Ah, money laundering...
Is very difficult these days, carl.
You still do it though, don't you?
That's a good-looking family right there.
You're not gonna hurt them, are you?
Hate to have to.
All right.
How do you want to do this?
I'll send my guy in tomorrow with a check for a million.
Tomorrow?
Yep, just like the old days.
You give him the cash, unmarked, send him on his way.
Whom should I expect?
Whom should--
Whom should you expect?
His name is juice.
Juice?
Mmm, he'll be here in exactly 24 hours.
Let's call it 1:00.
Come on.
Walk me out.
Show a little respect.
Whoa.
I know how you feel.
Hi.
Hi.
Can you see okay?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, sure.
I would like to open an account, please.
Eleven dollars.
Do you have any other money you'd like to deposit, mr.
Waters?
Oh, uh, I could,
But it's sort of hard to save around my house;
that's why I'm here.
I'm afraid we have a minimum balance.
It's $200.
Two hundred dollars?
That could take a million years.
Well, whenever you're ready, please come back and see me.
My name's shay stanley.
Ask for me.
Okay, I'll do that.
- Thanks.
- Bye-bye.
- I-I'll see you next time.
- I hope it's not in a million years.
B-bye-bye.
excuse me.
Carl, carl!
Here.
You can use these checks.
They're temporary.
Thank you, edward.
Like our relationship.
Sucker!
Give me that!
give it to me!
Butch, give it to me!
Preston, come on!
Butch!
- Give it back!
Whoa!
- If you can catch me!
Come on, butch!
Perfect.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
I-
- I--
Huh?
I saw the whole thing.
I can be a witness if the price is decent.
Get outta here.
He's perfectly all right, aren't you?
Aren't you?
- Yes.
- Good.
Get that thing out from underneath my car.
What about my bike?
Kid, was I the one that parked there-- oh, my word!
Are you all right?
He's fine.
It was just a little accident.
He's okay.
- I think this guy's been drinking vodka.
- I have not been drink--
I don't drink at all.
Seriously, seriously.
Kid, talk to me.
How much you want for the bike?
- A thousand bucks.
- I'm not talking to you!
Bye, kid.
Go on.
Walk away.
What do you want, kid?
Name a figure, we'll discuss it.
Give this to your dad.
He'll know what to do with it.
I gotta go.
Oh, man.
I thought we understood about taking care of our valuables.
Valuable?
It was a piece of junk.
If that's how you feel about a gift from your parents,
I don't see giving you a new one for your birthday.
I don't want a new bike.
I want my own room.
I'm warning you.
You're on thin ice as it is about the bike.
You know what I want?
What I want is my own house.
My rules, my money.
Listen, young man, until further notice, you're grounded.
What'd I do wrong?
fred.
Hmm.
It's a blank check.
Preston waters.
Two hundred.
Hmm.
A thousand.
Hmm.
One million dollars.
Cash.
Whoa!
One million dollars.
Hey, sonny.
Cashin' a big one today?
Uh, sort of.
Yoo-hoo.
Over here, young man.
Well?
I-I-I'd like to...
Cash this check, please.
Oh, a comedian.
N-no, ma'am.
Okay, then we better take it to mr.
Biderman.
Come on!
Excuse me, mr.
Biderman.
We have a little problem here.
What is it, mrs.
Udowitz?
Someone thinks this is some kind of game.
What?
Let me see that.
I see.
Is there much of a line out there, mrs.
Udowitz?
Yes, we're swamped.
Then what are you doing here?
Please.
- Juice?
- No, thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Not thirsty.
Mr. Quigley give you this check?
He did.
He did.
How did you run into mr.
Quigley?
I didn't.
He ran into me.
Aha.
brilliant.
Brilliant!
I suppose you want big bills.
Actually, regular size would be okay.
Regular.
Hmm.
That's cute.
Put your backpack on the table.
Hey, hey.
I assume you know what to do with this.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Next!
Look here, sweetheart.
Mmm, you're lookin' kind of good there.
You got your pearls and everything on.
Hate for something to have to happen to 'em.
Look here, my name is juice...
And I got something right here, and I wondered...
If you'd be so kind enough as to cash it for me.
What do you want?
A million bucks?
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.
go see biderman.
Mm-mm.
Oh, my goodness gracious.
Here we go.
Here we go.
You tell mr.
Quigley that he hasn't lost his touch.
Uh-huh.
All right.
You can go now.
Hey, kid!
- Stay away from the racetrack.
- Yes, sir.
Good one, man.
Looking good.
Mmm.
Oh!
Excuse me, sweetie.
What's wrong with you, little boy?
I'm sorry.
Don't be messin' up a view as good as all that.
I-I'm sorry.
What you doin' out of school anyway, huh?
You know you oughta be in school.
Go on and get up outta here before I start to get upset.
Hurry up.
How, uh-- how may I help you, sir?
I'm big juice, man.
Quigley sent me.
Everything is fine.
Not to worry.
Uh-huh.
Yeah!
- The eagle has landed.
- Hmm?
The horse is in the barn.
The chicken...
Is in the pot.
Look here, man, I don't know nothin' about no eagles landing' and all of that.
I don't know nothin' about no horse running' through the barn.
And I certainly don't know nothin' about no...
Chickens bein' in the pot.
You understand?
But if you do me a favor...
As to be so kind as to cash this check right there,
- I could be on my way.
- Wait.
- Quigley sent you?
- That's right.
- What about the kid?
- What kid?
Man--
The kid!
The kid with the backpack!
Look here, man.
I'm tired of tellin' you this.
But if you don't give me the money for that check,
I guarantee there's a bullet with your name on it in this chamber.
the kid with the backpack.
The kid with the backpack!
The backpack!
The backpack!
Shit!
Oh, my god!
150 grand, cash.
It's my last offer, guys.
you're our realtor.
You tell us.
This offer is so much less than our asking price.
Well, mrs.
Appleton, it really is a buyer's market.
Do you mind if we take a minute to think about it?
Listen, I got all the time in the world, sweetheart.
Too bad I can't say the same for you two.
Applesauce, what's with the long face, my man?
I bought your pad.
You've got some cash.
It's a beautiful thing.
Su casa is soon to be mi casa.
You know what I'm saying?
Groovin' thing, man.
Yeah, well--
- Hello.
- good afternoon.
...Your house.
I'd like to make a cash offer on your house.
Someone else wants to make an offer.
What?
On this dump?
Uh, hello, sir.
Can you hear me?
Who is this yo-yo?
- one-sixty.
- What kind of hustle is this?
And what's with your voice, pal?
Sore throat-itis.
Yeah.
I'll tell you what.
One-seventy right now, cash, and I walk away.
You take it or leave it right now.
Ask the box.
One-eighty, plus closing costs.
One-eighty, top that, sucker.
Plus closing costs.
- One-ninety, darlin'.
Top that.
- Preston, honey?
I have a few errands to run.
I'll be back by 2:00.
Okay.
Bye, mom.
two hundred.
Two-ten.
Just to be safe, make that 3:00.
- Three hundred?
- Ma, you're killin' me on this deal.
Come on.
Are you tellin' me we're gonna sit here and listen...
To some talking box with a robot voice?
What is this?
Uh, 300 it is.
Are you prepared to top 300?
No, I don't think I'm prepared to top 300!
Are you out of your mind?
We had a deal here!
Are you realtors just a bunch of crooks?
Is that it?
What's going on with you people?
Well, I am sorry you feel that way,
But I have an offer on the table of 300.
- thousand.
- Uh, we'll take it.
- Sold.
- Yeah.
You probably won't live to enjoy the cash.
just one thing, sir.
What is your name?
My name is preston--
Bingo.
Macintosh.
My name is macintosh.
Well, congratulations, mr.
Macintosh.
- You have a house.
- Yes!
I'm rich!
Yeah!
Whoo, yes!
Yeah!
Money!
Money!
You did what with my money?
you're not gonna believe this.
He gave all your money to a little old bitty boy.
That was my nest egg.
That's all I had to start a new life.
I worked hard to steal that money, biderman!
You gave it to some zit-faced little kid?
Now wait a minute.
I seen the kid.
His skin looked pretty smooth.
The boy had a check signed by you.
I didn't write a check to anybody except for this genius here.
Now hold on a minute.
I'm not the one who cashed a check for a million dollars.
That was this man right here.
Had your signature.
I said I didn't write it!
You gave me the checkbook,
I put it in my pocket, I got in my car, I--
I-
- I can't feel my legs.
Uh, I-- oh, oh, oh.
Calm down.
I've got a surveillance photo of the boy.
we'll find him in no time.
Oh, yeah, that's him.
I can't see a thing.
I recognize him.
I'd know him anywhere.
It's upside-down.
All right.
So where are you gonna find the kid, mr.
Family man?
- Newspapers.
- You want me to advertise, is that it?
No, no, no.
They have listings.
Uh, family activities where, where-- you know, things where kids go.
See?
Fine.
You're gonna help me find him.
You understand?
Dead or alive.
Uh-huh.
Let's get out of here.
Oh, don't think you ain't comin' with us.
Somebody's in there with biderman now.
A couple of guys I've never seen before.
They've just left.
The money laundering is definitely on again.
We've got to notify the bureau right away.
hello, limousines unlimited.
You have the car keys?
No, you have the car keys.
Oh, yeah.
You make sure you-know-who stays grounded.
And he goes to bed early.
You got it, pops.
Don't call me that.
Uh, excuse me.
Sorry, kid.
Nobody famous inside.
Do you want to take your mitts off the car, please?
I'm waitin' for a client here.
But I'm your client.
Oh, right, yeah.
And I'm madonna.
Sorry, kid.
The boss doesn't like me taking baseball cards as payment.
So if you want to ride in this, you need some buckaroos, buckarinis,
Some moola, some dinero, some money, some frogskins,
Much similar to the money you've given me--
In fact, identical to the money you've given me right now.
I was just kiddin' about bein' madonna.
My name's henry.
Hi, henry.
I'm preston.
Preston, good to see ya.
Preston waters.
Yes, nice to meet ya.
Hop in.
Go ahead.
I didn't actually mean hop in, but--
So, where to, boss?
Well, harry, we're gonna go buy some stuff.
Yes, sir.

Yeah, yeah.
If you don't mind me askin', where does he get his money?
Well, he doesn't get it, he just has it.
Why does he get a kid like you to go out and buy all this stuff for him?
He-- he never had a real childhood.
So now that he's really, really rich,
He can have all the fun that he couldn't have when he was a kid.
Oh.
Oh, I see.
You know.
So he didn't have any fun when he was a kid,
But now he's old and he's got money.
You're a kid having the fun for him now...
That he couldn't have when he was a kid.
Okay, sure.
Stop!

Ah, it's my boss, mr.
Macintosh.
Do you want a ride?
No, thanks.
I'm outta shape.

And opening my account.
Wow, you got the $200 already?
- Just about.
- All right.
Well, see you tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Was that him?
Was that biderman?
No, some kid who came into the bank today.
Nice wheels for a kid.
Yeah.
Says it belongs to his boss, a guy named macintosh.
Macintosh.
When are we gonna see biderman?
it looks like a circus.
Hey.
Hey, hey, move it.
I've got work to do too, you know.
Where am I supposed to go?
You see an opening?
Huh?
Hey, what's the holdup here?
Yeah, same to you, buddy.
Hey, move it!
What is all this?
What a mess.
This is absolute madness!
Yo, who's in charge here?
you with the race car, put it in the backyard.
Uh, the water slide goes back by the pool.
You guys with the tvs, put them in the living room.
Hey, you with the cadillac, out by the pool.
You in the green jumpsuits, bring that around the back.
- Preston?
- Hi, dad.
- What's going on here?
- Movin' in.
- Who is moving in?
- Macintosh.
- Who's macintosh?
- I'll be right with you, dad.
Come on, boys.
I don't have all day.
Okay, mr.
Waters, the security system is all in place.
Excuse me.
This is the remote.
Here are the instructions.
All right?
We appreciate mr.
Macintosh's business.
Here you go, pal.
What's with all the security?
Mr. Macintosh says you can never be too paranoid, dad.
Well, who is macintosh?
I work for him.
He's paying me.
Yeah, but who is he?
I never met him.
You mean you haven't met him?
No, I haven't met him.
He's heard about you.
Really?
Yeah, about work and stuff.
Really good things.
Well-- his stuff is blocking our driveway.
Dad.
Boys!
Could you clear a path, please?

Mm-hmm.
He just moved here.
Apparently loaded.
Apparently.
I don't feel good about being here.
People may get the wrong idea.
Really?
You don't feel good?
How do you think I felt when you gave away my million dollars, huh?
Juice.
See anybody that looks like him?
Oh, yeah.
He looks like him.
Uh, she looks like him right there.
Way back over there, uh, there goes his little twin brother.
You give me one picture and expect me to find him out of all these kids?
You must be crazy.
I'm gonna get on the water slide.
I'm startin' to sweat.
Hey, mister, you know where the refreshment stands are?
no.
Boom, boom, boom!
I got you!
Boom, boom, boom, boom!
he says he knows you, boss.
Oh, well, just throw him out.
ow!
Ow!
Banzai!

I didn't expect to see you here.
- Oh, what you doin' here?
- I came by to see mr.
Macintosh.
- Oh, no, he's in a meeting.
- That's okay, I'll wait.
I just really need to see him.
- He's in meetings all day.
- All day?
- Swamped.
- Hey, I missed you at the bank.
I thought you were gonna come by and see me about opening up an account.
Oh, I had to work.
Wow.
This is where you work?
- Not too shabby.
- Comfortable.
I brought an application.
Do you still want to open up an account with me?
Yeah.
- Okay.
Do you have your deposit?
- I'll go get it.
Okay.
Great.
Whoa!
That's amazing!
Sorry, just printed it.
Two hundred dollars.
Looks like you fell into some money, huh?
I make a living.
Yeah, well, I guess mr.
Macintosh--
He knows a good man when he sees one.
Will he be opening up an account with us?
Uh, maybe.
Yeah?
Great.
You know, I'd love to meet him.
How's tonight?
Uh, tonight.
What's tonight?
Tonight's Wednesday.
Wednesday.
Wednesday.
I'm sorry, he's busy.
- Too bad.
- Uh, but I'm not.
Oh, I handle all his financial affairs.
You do?
Not all of them,
But I can tell you a lot about him, sort of like a pre-meeting.
- And he wouldn't mind?
- Hasn't complained yet.
Okay.
I'll come by around 8:00.
Okay.
Wait, I could send a car for you.
Okay.
Cool.
It's a date then.
Bye-bye.
A date?
A date?
I've never been on a date.
You know what they call me downtown?
The babe-meister.
Think about it.
Okay, I'm gonna tell you about the real deal on dating, which I know.
First of all, women love a great body.
They love-- look at this bod.
Whoa.
See?
Yeah, yeah.
Of course, you've got a bod now that's of a greek god.
Really.
Think about it.
Women like you to have a good bod because they want to feel they're protected.
You might have to fight some guy, you know?
But not with those arms.
You don't want to hit a guy with those arms 'cause those pythons would take a guy's head off.
Seriously.
You're buff, but we're gonna get you chiseled.
Okay?
Oh, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm having a vision here of a date.
The perfect date for you guys.
Uh, steak heaven!
Ho, ho!
My little friend, you really have the hots for this one, huh?
You know, if you really want to go upscale,
That all-you-can-eat salad bar-- women love that.
And take some with you.
You know, line your pockets with plastic bags.
Put the food in there.
'cause it doesn't say "all you can eat here."
Does it say "here" on the sign?
I don't think so.
So you take something back for later.
A little snackaroo.
Oh, women love that.
You get home and you got a pocketful of hot wings.
There's nothing more that impresses a woman.
Get yourself some flowers.
Get yourself a great body,
Some nice hair, some good clothes, a car,
And learn to say words like "noncommittal."
You are a date and a half, pal.

Why are you dressed like a game show host?
I'm going out tonight.
Just a minute, young man.
You're still grounded.
But it's for mr.
Macintosh.
I don't care.
Macintosh may have a pile of money, but he doesn't decide...
When my son is or isn't grounded.
But it's for my job.
Your job is to be grounded.
- grounded.
- So much for plan 442.
What do you know about plan 442?
Well, it's the investment plan you've been working on, your "prespectus."
Prospectus.
What are you doing going through my work?
Well, I didn't want to say it, but I told mr.
Macintosh...
About your plan 442, and he was very, very interested.
Yep, I promised him I'd bring a copy of it tonight and show it to him.
But I didn't want to tell you just in case you got your hopes all up and--
No, no, no, no, no, of course not.
Let me get you a fresh copy of the "prespectus."
- I'll get a copy of it, sweetheart.
- Prospectus.
Yeah.
Here.
You're welcome.
Oh, thank you.
Hurry up.
Go.
Go!
You want the car keys?
Nah, that's okay, dad.
I don't drive yet.
you want me to drive you?
no, it's okay.
You know, I still haven't met macintosh.
Maybe I should go over and--
- No!
You'll ruin everything.
- Why not?
He has a date tonight and he's very nervous about it.
I guess I can see him first thing in the morning.
Oh, I don't know, dad.
I mean, he might be up pretty late with this woman.
lucky dog.
Later, toads.
thank you.
That's enough.
Oh!
Sorry.
I can't believe mr.
Macintosh went to all this trouble.
This place is great.
Mr. Macintosh has been eating here for years.
Oh, yeah?
I thought he just moved here.
There was a tangerino where I used to live.
Oh.
Compliments of the chef for mr.
Waters...
And his lovely guest.
Th-they look like lobsters,
Only weenie.
Oh.
Mr. Macintosh wanted you to have this too.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, wow.
This is beautiful.
Oh.
But I can't accept this from you.
But it's from mr.
Macintosh.
- Why?
- Just a little business gift.
I mean, it's deductible, isn't it?
I'm not really sure, but it's way too expensive.
Mr. Macintosh has a million dollars.
A million dollars doesn't buy all that much these days.
Do you think he should have asked for more?
What exactly does he do anyway?
Oh, a little of this, a little of that.
You know.
No, I'm afraid I don't.
- Oh, well-- - is he an entrepreneur?
No, he's american.
Very secretive.
He has some questions for you too.
Okay.
Shoot.
"are you married?" no.
"what's the shortest guy you ever dated?"
Mmm.
I'm not really sure.
"the youngest?" you know,
These are pretty personal questions.
Well, mr.
Macintosh is very interested in you.
He is?
He's, uh, never met anybody like you before.
He's never met me before, period.
Technically no, but he's been thinking a lot about you lately.
- He has?
- Yep.
Whoa!
Preston!
Are you okay?
Do you like hamburgers?
I love hamburgers.
Never saw this kid before in my life.
This is a waste of time.
Come on.
What's so special about this place?
You'll see.
Mmm, come on.
Tell me.
Okay.
You gonna tell me?
Come with me.
All right.
Where are you taking me?
You'll see.
See what?
Okay, get in the middle.
Okay, ready?
Five, four, three, here?
Two, one.
holy smokes!
Okay!
Okay, now, come here, shay!
Okay, okay, now!
Preston, I don't believe this!
Okay, now, let's run around!
Don't get wet!
Get us out!
Run!
Okay, okay, okay!
Watch out!
- No, we're gonna get soaked!
- No, no, no.
Now come--
Come around here!
Come around here!
Come on!
Okay, hold onto me.
hey, where are you?
yeah!
Yes!
Whoo, yeah!
Preston!
This is a great idea, biderman.
Where's all the kids, huh?
Carl, it's late at night.
What I expect is when I give someone a million dollars, and I come back a day later,
I find the million dollars.
That's what I expect.
Carl, I'm not a magician.
You can make it disappear,
You just can't get it back, right?
I'm telling you--
If y'all want a kid so bad, there go one over there.
that's the little boy from the bank!
Shh.
Shh.
go get him!
Oh, I'll race ya to the limo!
I'll race ya to the limo!

He got away again!
I don't believe this!
He got away again!
this was the most fun.
I haven't done anything like this since I was a little kid.
Me neither.
Thank you so much.
When can I see you again?
Well, I really have to spend some time with my job right now.
Well, uh, I'm having a party.
On Friday.
Can you come?
It's for mr.
Macintosh.
Um, it could be for your business, sort of.
Mr. Macintosh will really be there?
Uh-huh.
It's his birthday.
Okay.
Well, great.
It's a date then.
Oh, I'm getting out up here.
It was really fun.
And, uh,
I had such a good time.
Me too.
Good night, preston.
Good night, shay.
See you later.
Bye-bye.
Good night, ma'am.
Bye now.
It's been a pleasure.
Thank you.
so you're having a party Friday?
oh, yeah, it's mr.
Macintosh's birthday.
Oh, I thought you said it was your birthday Friday.
Well, we're gonna have a joint party for the both of us.
Oh.
Well, it's a good thing it worked out your birthdays are around the same time.
Hey, you wanna move that horse?
Come on.
What is this, bonanza?
Let's go!
Well, here we are.
Home at last.
Thanks, henry.

Good night.
Macintosh and I are having the biggest birthday party ever.
Honey, where's preston?
He's working for macintosh.
Oh.
Where's damien and ralph?
They're working for macintosh too.
Oh.
- Have you met macintosh?
- No, I thought you met him.
No, I haven't met him.
Well, I haven't met him either.
Keep 'em comin'.
Mr. Macintosh wants me to get plenty of practice.
watch where you're hittin' those!
Quit messin' around.
Macintosh is watching.
Where?
We've still never seen him.
Just get back to work.
He's watching.
Ruining the neighborhood.
hey, preston!
Your party planner's here again.
piston!
Piston!
Piston!
Turn off this contraption.
I have wonderful news.
Mr. Macintosh's birthday is going to be the event of the century.
We gonna make the front page from coast to coast.
Oh, we are so lucky, lucky, lucky!
Now what kind of food does mr.
Macintosh like?
I don't know.
And who are his friends?
- Do you have a guest list?
- Uh, I don't think so.
You know, dewdrop, I think I should meet him because...
I'm gonna need a little cash deposit.
Oh.
Uh, here.
Let me get you some cash.
Ooh, yes, you do have money, don't you?
Wait, wait, wait.
Careful walking around with this much money, darling.
Somebody could just rip you right off.
Now, this first $10,000 is going to be the deposit.
Now, of course, I'll get the balance at the party,
And mr.
Macintosh is good for it?
I am just so looking forward to meeting him.
- Who isn't?
- Waiters, security,
Guest list, paparazzi-- oh, and yvonne?
Yes?
Remember, it's preston.
Whatever!
Hey, uh, hey, henry.
it's attack of the 50-foot chauffeur from hell!
I was just wondering if you wanted to play some video games.
Oh, man, I wish you'd have said something.
I can't.
I promised some friends I was gonna meet 'em in a while.
Oh, okay.
No problem.
I'll tell you what.
I'll drop you over at one of your friend's place...
On the way over, and you can have some fun there.
Nah.
Maybe I'll go to the park.
All right.
It's up to you.
Hey, preston,
Is my tie straight?
Well, it looks perfect.
All right.
Later.
Over here.
Over here!
There it is.
That's the park up ahead.
Where did all these kids come from?
Keep driving and maybe someday I'll tell you.
- How could you hit a kid?
- I didn't hit a kid.
I ran over his bicycle.
I had a dog once that got hit by a train.
Thanks for sharing, juice.
Old king cole we called him.
He was a merry old soul.
It's him.
Boy with the backpack.
Go!
Go!
Go!
The sign says "no cars allowed"!
Just drive!
Quigley!
You're gonna pay for this!
Just drive!
Carl, this isn't a good idea.
Shut up!
Whoa!
Let go, man.
What's goin' on?
Oooh!
Oooh!
I'm gonna get him.
We're gonna tear him up!
Reach over there and get him!
Your butt is mine, kid!
I've been wantin' this little punk.
I own you!
I own you, kid!
Come here!
He's got my money!
Aaaah!
Follow him on foot!
Go!
Follow him on foot?
Do I look like a bloodhound, a professional tracker?
Juicy, listen.
If we don't get that kid, nobody gets paid.
I want cash benefits, dental, everything.
Not a problem.
Insurance!
Here, kiddie, kiddie!
Oh, there you go.
Come here, boy.
I'm gonna get you now.
I've been lookin' for you!
Huh?
Oh, no.
There he goes.
Yes.
Come here, boy!
I'm gonna get you now!
Aaaah!
Don't believe this!
Kill that kid when I find him.
I'm not gettin' paid for this.
Where are we going now?
My hands are over my eyes.
Shut up!
Get out--
There he is!
Stick with it!
I got ya!
I'll get you!
Hang on, hang on.
Okay, there he is!
Come here!
Come here!
Juice!
Run after him.
You must be crazy.
You run after him.
Just ran through this whole entire park.
Fine, get in the car.
don't blow chunks in my car.
I just had it detailed.
I'm cool!
Are you sure?
Are you sure?
I'm not gonna mess up your priceless detail.
Come on.
hey!
wow, what's this?
Let's go!
After him!
- Hey, dude!
- move outta the way.
Sorry!
Get 'im!
Your butt is mine!
I want this kid-- what are you doing?
- Yeah!
- No!
Carl, watch out!
oh, no!
Whoa!
Aah!
No!
Oh, man!
Yes!
Now that's a display of fine driving right there.
You know, carl, it might be easier just to steal another million dollars.
Hello, mr.
Jackson.
Well, well, well, if it isn't the world's youngest personal injury attorney.

Ta-da!
Is this to die, or what?
Uh, yeah, sure, it's, uh, to die.
I can't wait to show it to mr.
Macintosh.
Come on, honey, let's see what they did with that--
"is it to die for or what?"
Where did you find her?
Oh, man.
What does this cost?
I don't know.
What do you think it should cost?
Lots, lots.
Kid, why don't you just tell me what I need to know.
I'm a good guy.
Okay, how good are you going to be to me?
In round numbers.
I don't think you get the picture, sonny.
Maybe you need a better view.

Thank you.
You all right?
Aaah!
Aaah!
Is something wrong?
No, not at all.
- Is mr.
Macintosh around?
- Uh, no.
- But he will be here tonight?
- Yeah.
In person?
In person.
Okay.
I'll see you tonight?
Okay.
Okay.
You're looking good.
Bye.
I'll be calling.
What a babe.
Baby brother comes into his own.
For a little weasel, he sure knows how to get a girlfriend.

Little love pilot...
Shot down in flames by a gold digger.
By a what?
Gold digger, someone who is only after money.
I know women,
And that one is after macintosh's cold, hard cash.
For your information, me and shay already went on a date...
And she had one fantastic time, boys.
Oh, yes, every second she was getting closer...
And closer to mr.
Macintosh.
Shut up!
Just answer me this.
Did she ever, ever just once, come by without saying,
"meanwhile, I wonder if I could see mr.
Macintosh?"
She's a gold digger, man.
She just wants macintosh's money.
Yeah!
Ow!
Don't rub it.
Be a man.
Don't rub it.
I'll rub it if I want to.
She wants a guy with money, not some little kid with an empty piggy bank.
Yeah.

You ever known any gold diggers?
Man, have I.
I hate 'em.
They're the worst.
Anybody who is your friend because you have money is not your friend at all.
You know what they say about gold?
"he who has the gold makes the rules"?
No, no, no.
"a fool and his gold are soon parted."
What does that mean?
"a fool and his gold are soon parted." those old sayings, man,
I don't get 'em.
I don't even know really what that means.
"more than one way to skin a cat"?
Who skins cats?
Why would you skin a cat?
And there is not more than one way to skin a cat.
There is only one way.
You grab the cat, you rip the skin off the cat.
What is the number two way?
You put a hose up the cat's butt?
He gets so bloated that he skins himself?
Does he have a piece of velcro under his butt?
No.
"kill two birds with one stone." you heard that one?
You know anyone who has even killed one bird with one stone?
Kids try it all the time.
You can't hit a bird with a stone.
Unless you got a huge stone and they're tiny baby birds.
Then-- beep, beep!
Dead.
"a fool and his gold are soon parted."
I guess it means that if you're a fool,
Your gold or your money is soon gone.
Once it's gone, it is outta there.
It is history.
It is dust.
It is vapor.
It is no more.
You are living in brokesville.
Unless you have macintosh's kind of money.
What if you don't?
I guess then you find out who your real friends are.
Man, we look good.
Is everybody having a good time?
Good, you are. "yes, we are, darling." wow, look at the balloons.
This is great.
Look at the ice sculpture.
Presents!
Hey, hey, hey, kid, no touching.
Those are mr.
Macintosh's.
Go find your parents.
Go on, get outta here.
Go on!
I just want to see mr.
Macintosh.
I just want to pig out.
hey, look at that.
Excuse me.
Sorry!
Exactly who are you looking for, preston?
Have you seen shay?
I haven't seen her, but she'll be around.
Come on-- oh, man, look at all this food!
Macintosh doesn't show, we bring the kid in, agreed?
If preston says macintosh is gonna be there, macintosh will be there.
But you don't make a move, until I give you the signal, understood?
We got eight men ready to go in and nail him the second he shows up!
We close this deal tonight!
Where's the pizza and the ice cream?
What's going on here?
This could have been a pizza before it got run over by a couple of trucks.
Oh, that looks tasty.
Looks like something you'd find between your toes.
Ah, ah, ah!
It's sucking the life outta me!
- Shut up!
Everybody's looking.
- So what?
Who cares?
Relax, have a good time.
She'll show up.
Oh, there's shay now.
Ha!
Just kidding.
I was kidding ya!
Would you just relax?
She'll be here.
It's not at all what you thought it'd be like?
Hate being rich, huh?
Preston?
Preston?
Ice cream, ice cream.
Yoo-hoo, preston!
Now, where is our mystery man?
It's time for mr.
Macintosh to make his appearance.
I like to give my employers their bills directly.
That way if they have any questions or heart attacks or something--
I'll give it to him.
Fine.
Be quick about it.
$100,000?
Sweetheart, I know this seems like a whole lot of money to normal people like me and you,
But to a man like macintosh this is just pennies.
Now, you get up there and get me my money!
Ow!
I'll get your money.
$100,000.
Not a problem.
You can leave it.
This is fine.
I'll be right back.

Mr. Macintosh?
Oh, sorry to bother you.
It's fred waters, preston's dad.
I know you got a bash going on here, so I'll make it brief.
But, uh,
I wanted to ask you a favor.
You see, today is preston's birthday and if you see him,
If you could send him home a little early.
Lately he's been working so hard.
All of a sudden money's become so important to him.
I guess that's mostly my fault.
You don't have kids, do you, mr.
Macintosh?
I'll tell you, it's very easy to make mistakes with them.
I haven't always paid enough attention to my kids.
I pushed them too hard...
Maybe.
Especially preston.
I guess I expect more from him.
He reminds me of myself at that age.
I couldn't wait to grow up.
I'm afraid he's missing out on his childhood.
So am I.
Well, thanks.
I won't take up any more of your time.
And we appreciate you sending preston home early.
If-- if he wants to come, that is.
I want to come home.
Thanks.

Excuse me.
Sorry.

Mr. Macintosh?
It's just me.
Which one of us did you want?
I was looking for you.
Oh, good.
And mr.
Macintosh.
Look, it's very, very important that I find mr.
Macintosh right now.
- Do you understand?
- He's nowhere.
He's gone.
I think you'd better leave too.

You could be in danger.
Just go, okay?
You got your necklace.

Nobody s-should have been invited.
Macintosh is-- is gone.
And he's not coming back.
So I think you should all leave too, so go.

Got a big check to cash?

What do you think, juice?
Oh, yeah, I like the pad.
It looks real nice.
Can you handle it?
Got the tv, drums.
Oh, I like this.

- How do you work this?
Well, you turn the knob--
You really shouldn't let him in such a nice house as this.
All your stuff could get broken.
Kid, where's macintosh?
N-nowhere.
He's nowhere.
I'm going to ask you one more time.
Where is he?
Huh!
There is no macintosh.
I made him up.
It was me the whole time.
Don't give me that.
Who bought this house?
I-I did.
You?
You outbid me?
Wait a minute.
You tryin' to tell me that this little boy here...
Outbid you with your own money?
Be a fly on the wall, okay, juice?
Listen, kid, you know it's illegal to take things that don't belong to you.
I know.
I feel awful.
Take me to the police.
Carl, don't do it.
It's a trick.
Get outta here.
Son, I don't want to take you to the police.
Just tell me, okay?
Where's my money?
I-I spent it.
- All of it?
- All of it.
How could you spend...
A million dollars in six days?
You must not have been shopping lately.
Carl, carl, wait a minute.
Maybe we're thinking about this macintosh thing in the wrong way.
What are you talking about?
You needed a new house, a new identity.
This kid, he's done it for you.
I mean, macintosh could run for mayor here.
Yeah, I kind of like the idea of that-- mayor quigley.
No, no, mayor macintosh.
I like it.
Look, there's only one problem with that.
The-- aaah!
Hey!
Come back here!
Wait for me!
I'm coming!
He's upstairs, man!
Break it down!
Break it down!
There he is!
Where is he?
Where is he?
He went down there!
Juice, go after him!
I ain't goin' down there.
Go on!
Now!
You're crazy.
I ain't goin' down there.
Watch your head.
What is it, about 230-- whoa!
Aaah!
I'm not goin' in there.
Oh, no, he didn't.
Did you see him?
Oh, no, you did just push me in the pool!
Get out, we gotta find him!
What?
What happened?
Act like you got a purpose in life.
Go.
I think I'm experiencing chest pains.
Carl?
Juice?
Huh?
Oh.
Little boy?
Little boy from the bank?
Ha, ha.
Oh!
Where am I?
Oh-oh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Hey, hey!
Got ya!
Uh-huh!
- Hey!
- Got him.
It's time for a little batting practice.
Here we go!
Hey!
What's happening?
Whoa!
Hey!
Just outside.
Let's try a sinker.
A sinker!
Another!
Another!
Let's try a screwball!
- Turn, turn, turn!
- Be cool!
Ow!
Hey!
Ho!
Come on, boy!
Screwball!
Boom!
Whoa!
Oooh!
- That must have hurt!
- My god!
Fastball, fastball!
Just inside!
Oooh!
Ow!
What's next, juice?
How about tennis?
It's over, kid.
Ow!
Ow!
Preston, come out, come out, wherever you are.
None of this would have happened, you know,
If you hadn't been a bad boy!
Tell me something, did you think you were going to get away with it?
Spending somebody else's hard-earned money?
Huh!
We need to have a chat.
Preston...
I'm not mad anymore.
I know you're sorry.
Come on, buddy.
Pres?
Come on out now!
Banzai!
Quigley, I'll be back in a minute.
Don't leave me here-- oh, where am I goin'?
Whoa!
Kid!
Don't you move.
Juice!
Biderman!
Get your useless butt over here!
Whoa!
Oh!
Oh!
Kid!
Kid!
What are you doin'?
Oh!
Oh!
Kid, kid, stop, please, please!
Stop!
Oh!
Kid, please!
Don't do that!
Ooooh!
Quigley?
Are you okay?
Aaah!
I got you now!
Come get him!
I got him now.
Come get him, you guys.
All right, hold him.
Baseballs!
You're not a very nice boy, you know that?
Freeze!
Preston, are you okay?
What's this all about?
What's happening here?
Stanley?
What are you doing here?
Let go!
As of this moment, you're fired from my bank!
F.B.I., biderman.
From this moment, you're fired from your bank.
- What?
- You're with the f.B.I.?
Yes, preston, I am.
Okay, kid, finally, at long last, who's macintosh?
Uh, uh, uh, uh,
Uh, uh,
Uh, uh--
- I'm macintosh.
- You'remacintosh?
I'm macintosh!
And I want you all off my property now!
He's macintosh.
You sure?
I tell ya, I'm macintosh!
Please tell these guys I'm macintosh.
Oh, he's macintosh.
Don't you know papa macintosh?
Mr. Macintosh.
And big mama macintosh be hangin' out with the brothers.
Mr. Macintosh, you're under arrest for fraud, money laundering and grand theft.
- What are you talking about?
- Bring in biderman too.
- I'm a banker!
- And take mr.
Wise guy too.
Who?
Me?
I'm not wise.
Get your hands off me.
Man, I flunked recess.
Take it easy, man.
- Take 'em out.
- I'm not even from here, man.
- I'm a banker.
I was roaming down the street.
Cat said, hey, there's a party.
I own a bank!
Sir, stay behind the line there.
Everyone, just calm down, okay?
Honey, I'm gonna check this out, make sure that preston's okay.
You take the boys home.
What's going on?
Something to do with macintosh.
The f.B.I. Is all over.
Uh, have you seen my son, a little boy?
He's inside with the f.B.I.
Excuse me, excuse me, please.
Officer-- whoa, whoa!
Nobody gets in there without a badge, sir.
I'm looking for my son.
Kind of neat.
Can I see your badge?
Shay stanley, f.B.I.
Cool.
Wait a minute.
So that means our date...
Was just for your-- just for your job?
Well, it started out like that.
I should have known.
Hey, you know, I wouldn't have traded that night for anything.
So when can I see you again, shay?
Mmm, why don't you give me a call in, say, about ten years?
Five.
Seven.
Six.
Okay, it's a date.
Good night, preston.
preston!
Preston?
Oh, my god, he's in shock.
Oh, oh, I'm fine, dad.
I'm fine now.
Oh, I'm glad to see you.
What's going on here?
It's a long story.
Well, why don't we go on home, you tell me all about it?
Okay.
I want to say good-bye to a friend, okay, dad?
Wow, this is just great.
I can't step out for a couple of seconds.
I miss all the action.
Thanks.
- Are you okay?
- I thought you left, man.
No, I didn't leave.
What did we say the party needed?
Ice cream, right?
I just went to get ice cream.
I don't know if I got the exact recipe,
But I think I got it close.
So?
Hey, it's pretty close.
Well, I guess macintosh is no more, huh?
It's too bad, because, uh, I really enjoyed working for him.
I had a good time too-- do me a favor?
Next time you see him,
Tell him, uh, that I'm really gonna miss him.
I'll miss you too, henry.
You're gonna do just fine.
See ya.
- Hey, henry.
- Huh?
- Know what you have?
- What?
- S-t-y-l-e, style.
- Style.
Hey, preston, you're not gonna finish this ice cream, I guess, huh?
Well, no sense letting' this go to waste.
So, what happened?
Oh, well, uh, macintosh wasn't--
He-- he wasn't who he thought he was.
How do you mean?
Well, he shouldn't have done what he did.
He shouldn't have fooled everybody.
I think you're right.
It's been a long night.
Better get on up to bed.
Yeah, I think I ought to get some sleep too, dad.
And tomorrow, I'll tell you all about mr.
Macintosh.
Sleep well, preston.

[Panting]
[Thunder Rumbling]
[Grunting]
Where are you?
Oh.
Hello, beautiful.
[Kissing Sound]
Did you miss me?
Dad, I've given this some thought... and I've decided that since Damien and Ralph have their own rooms, well, there's no reason why they should be bringing their junk into my room.
Well, how does that sound, Helen?
- [Gulping] - [Door Opening]
- Out of the way, stick boy!
- Hand Foot is here to stay.
- Oops, kicked your baby monkey.
- Get out of here, Ralph!
- Here, take this.
- Go away, Damien.
This is my room.
Was.
Now it's also the world headquarters of Hand Foot, Incorporated.
- Hand Foot all the way!
- Hand Foot, Hand Foot, Hand Foot!
- Hand Foot?
You guys aren't gonna make a dime.
- Okay, we'll use this.
- Yeah!
- Hey, that's my life savings!
- Consider yourself our silent partner.
- Yeah, say something and you're dead.
- Yeah.
- How's the big move going?
- Great.
- Good.
Come on, Ralph.
Gotta get to work.
Dad?
[Clears Throat]
Dad... well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've decided that...
- s-s-since Damien and Ralph have their own room...
- Preston, they need the space for their business.
- Not my space.
- Young man, in this family, industry gets rewarded.
While you're in here playing, your brothers are hard at work.
- Yeah, kissing' butt for money.
- [Ralph] Well, you know the golden rule.
- He who has the gold makes the rules.
- One day you'll have a job.
- When I was your age, I had my own business cleaning wheels.
- [Mimicking Dad]
I was pulling down 100 bucks a week polishing cars.
- You used to say 75.
- Well, you gotta think big, Preston.
- Surprise.
- [Brothers] Whoa, check it out.
Yeah, it's for your business.
We had a spare at the office.
- Damien, the speakers are out in the hall.
- How does it work?
It imitates human intelligence, like you guys.
- Preston, maybe you could teach your brothers how to use it.
- Not possible.
[Dad] The software will teach you how to do everything but make love to a woman.
- Now I know what programme to get your father for Christmas.
- Mom!
- Oops!
Uh, here.
Let me help you with that.
- Preston, you're gonna be late...
- for Butch's birthday party.
- Who wants to celebrate Butch's birth?
- [Dad] It's important to get out of your room more.
- [Brothers] Our room.
Well, good luck, guys.
[Computer Beeps, Talks] Damien and Ralph sleep... butt to face, butt to face,
- butt to face,
- Huh?
- Who said that?
- Butt to face, butt to face,
- Type "Quit." Hit "Delete."
- Butt to face, butt to face, butt to face...
- Turn it off!
Pull the plug!
- Ow!
- Don't rub it.
Be a man.
- [Moaning] Ouch!
- Little wimp.
[Dad] Come on, Preston.
You don't want to be late for Butch's birthday party.
- Are you gonna have fun today?
- [Preston] How can I, Dad?
- I don't have any money.
- Now, look.
Here's a couple of bucks.
Ah, heck, you can have fun all day on that.
You don't get out much, do you, Dad?
[P.A.] Welcome to Fun Land.
Fun, fun, fun for everyone.
Welcome to Fun Land.
Fun, fun, fun for everyone.
- Hey.
Hey, man.
- Hey, Butch.
Hey, man.
Yeah!
Hey, what's up?
Oh, look.
It's Presto the Pesto.
- Hello, Butch.
- [Kids Laughing]
Oh!
- Tokens!
- [Kids Cheering]
- Give me 50.
It's my birthday.
- Fifty.
- Twenty-five, please.
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-seven.
- Twenty-seven.
- Six, please.
- Six.
Six.
- Coming?
- I don't know.
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
- [Shouting]
- It's gonna be awesome!
- Yeah, let's go over here!
- This one!
- Hurry!
[Butch] Hey, Preston!
Hey, over here!
- Hey, Preston, how's your ostrich?
- Watch out!
Preston has an ostrich!
Hey, Preston, come with us!
- Just kidding!
- [Laughing]
[Groaning]
[Dad] Did you have fun at Butch's birthday party?
I have a question.
Are we broke?
- No, we just have to watch our spending habits.
- That's right.
Like when your mother calls her sister back East and talks for 97 minutes.
So if we're not poverty-stricken, there must be some other reason I'm so deprived.
- We're outta here!
Whoo!
- Goin' to the ball game.
- Can I go?
- We bought tickets, toad.
- [Mother] Damien!
- You need some cash?
- Nah, we got a bunch of change.
- Later, Preston.
It's not fair.
Why can't I have anything?
Well, Preston, they have jobs, and they've learned to save.
How can I save money if I don't have any?
A penny saved is a penny earned.
- What do you want for your birthday?
- Money... so I can pay to have Ralph and Damien knocked off.
Anything else?
Well, maybe we'll give him one of his birthday presents early.
A gift came from Grandma today.
Hmm.
What a rip-off!
It's a cheque for nothing!
I'm having a bad day.
Oh, your grandma just forgot to fill in how much it was for, but she signed it at the bottom, see?
It's a blank cheque.
- We'll just fill in the amount.
- How much did you get last year, honey?
A thousand.
- Ten dollars.
- Wait, Dad.
What about inflation?
- Oh, make it 11.
- [Muttering]
You'd be surprised how fast... eleven dollars can grow with interest.
Preston?
Preston?
[Preston] Eleven dollars... at 3.45 interest.
[Computer] Your account will reach... one million dollars... in 342,506 years.
I'm stuck here forever.
- [Dad] Lights out up there.
- Why?
My house, my rules.
"My house, my rules."
My own house.
[Yawning]
[Engine Stops, Car Door Shutting]
[Man] Dave, who needs assets?
I'm your asset.
- I'm a big asset.
Oh, c...
- [Man On Phone] I can't believe you.
Dave, Dave.
Come on, come on.
Why only borrow 150,000?
Our money is your money.
Round it off to two.
- Do I qualify?
- Of course you qualify for the loan, Dave.
We're golf partners.
- You don't look happy to see me.
- Quig...
- Quigley.
- Quigley.
That's funny.
I don't remember you stuttering on the witness stand.
- You just sang like a bird, didn't you?
- I had no choice, Carl.
- I mean, lying in court...
- You also pointed at me.
- That hurt.
- Well, I was under oath.
- I mean...
- Come here.
The only reason you're alive, Biderman, is I knew I might need you again someday...
like today.
Oh, sure.
You need a loan?
The rates are great now.
- And you get a toaster.
- I don't need a toaster.
Before I went away, I put aside a little nest egg.
[Gasping] These bills, they're marked consecutively.
- They'd trace these in a minute.
- That's right.
- [Coughing]
- That's where you come in, old buddy.
I want new bills.
- We're back in the SL business, Biderman.
- Ah, money laundering...
- is very difficult these days, Carl.
- You still do it though, don't you?
That's a good-looking family right there.
You're not gonna hurt them, are you?
- Hate to have to.
- All right.
How do you want to do this?
- I'll send my guy in tomorrow with a cheque for a million.
- Tomorrow?
Yep, just like the old days.
You give him the cash, unmarked, send him on his way.
- Whom should I expect?
- Whom should...
Whom should you expect?
His name is Juice.
- Juice?
- Mmm, he'll be here in exactly 24 hours.
Let's call it 1:00.
Come on.
Walk me out.
Show a little respect.
Whoa.
I know how you feel.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Can you see okay?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, sure.
I would like to open an account, please.
Eleven dollars.
Do you have any other money you'd like to deposit, Mr Waters?
Oh, uh, I could, but it's sort of hard to save around my house; that's why I'm here.
I'm afraid we have a minimum balance.
It's $200.
Two hundred dollars?
That could take a million years.
Well, whenever you're ready, please come back and see me.
My name's Shay Stanley.
- Ask for me.
- Okay, I'll do that.
- Thanks.
- Bye-bye.
- I-I'll see you next time.
- I hope it's not in a million years.
B-Bye-bye.
[Biderman] Excuse me.
Carl, Carl!
Here.
You can use these cheques.
They're temporary.
- Thank you, Edward.
- Like our relationship.
- Sucker!
- Give me that!
- [Laughing]
- Give it to me!
Butch, give it to me!
- Preston, come on!
- Butch!
- Give it back!
Whoa!
- If you can catch me!
Come on, Butch!
[Control Panel Dings, Engine Revs]
[Preston Screams]
- [Screaming] - [Tyres Screeching]
Perfect.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
L...
I...
- Huh?
- [Butch] I saw the whole thing.
- I can be a witness if the price is decent.
- Get outta here.
He's perfectly all right, aren't you?
Aren't you?
- Yes.
- Good.
Get that thing out from underneath my car.
What about my bike?
- Kid, was I the one that parked there...
- Oh, my word!
- Are you all right?
- He's fine.
It was just a little accident.
He's okay.
- I think this guy's been drinking vodka.
- I have not been drink...
[Laughs] I don't drink at all.
Seriously, seriously.
Kid, talk to me.
How much you want for the bike?
- A thousand bucks.
- I'm not talking to you!
Bye, kid.
Go on.
Walk away.
What do you want, kid?
Name a figure, we'll discuss it.
Give this to your dad.
He'll know what to do with it.
I gotta go.
[Tyres Screeching]
[Tyre Squeaking]
Oh, man.
I thought we understood about taking care of our valuables.
Valuable?
It was a piece of junk.
If that's how you feel about a gift from your parents,
I don't see giving you a new one for your birthday.
I don't want a new bike.
I want my own room.
I'm warning you.
You're on thin ice as it is about the bike.
You know what I want?
What I want is my own house.
My rules, my money.
Listen, young man, until further notice, you're grounded.
What'd I do wrong?
[Sighs] Fred.
Hmm.
It's a blank cheque.
"[Computer Start-Up Tone]
Preston Waters.
Two hundred.
Hmm.
A thousand.
Hmm.
One million dollars.
Cash.
Whoa!
One million dollars.
[Electronic Zooming]
Hey, sonny.
Cashin' a big one today?
Uh, sort of.
Yoo-hoo.
Over here, young man.
- Well?
- I-I-I'd like to... cash this cheque, please.
Oh, a comedian.
[Laughing]
- N-No, ma'am.
- Okay, then we better take it to Mr Biderman.
Come on!
- [Ticking] - [Door Opening]
Excuse me, Mr Biderman.
We have a little problem here.
What is it, Mrs Udowitz?
- Someone thinks this is some kind of game.
- What?
Let me see that.
I see.
Is there much of a line out there, Mrs Udowitz?
- Yes, we're swamped.
- Then what are you doing here?
Please.
[Door Closes]
- Juice?
- No, thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Not thirsty.
Mr Quigley give you this cheque?
He did.
He did.
How did you run into Mr Quigley?
I didn't.
He ran into me.
Aha.
[Snickering]
[Laughing] Brilliant.
Brilliant!
- [Groans]
- I suppose you want big bills.
Actually, regular size would be okay.
Regular.
Hmm.
That's cute.
Put your backpack on the table.
Hey, hey.
I assume you know what to do with this.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
Next!
Look here, sweetheart.
Mmm, you're lookin' kind of good there.
You got your pearls and everything on.
Hate for something to have to happen to 'em.
Look here, my name is Juice... and I got something right here, and I wondered... if you'd be so kind enough as to cash it for me.
What do you want?
A million bucks?
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.
[Sighs] Go see Biderman.
Mm-mm.
Oh, my goodness gracious.
Here we go.
Here we go.
You tell Mr Quigley that he hasn't lost his touch.
- Uh-huh.
- All right.
You can go now.
Hey, kid!
- Stay away from the racetrack.
- Yes, sir.
Good one, man.
Looking good.
Mmm.
Oh!
Excuse me, sweetie.
[Gasps]
- What's wrong with you, little boy?
- [Preston] I'm sorry.
Don't be messin' up a view as good as all that.
- I-I'm sorry.
- What you doin' out of school anyway, huh?
You know you oughta be in school.
Go on and get up outta here before I start to get upset.
Hurry up.
How, uh...
How may I help you, sir?
I'm big Juice, man.
Quigley sent me.
Everything is fine.
- Not to worry.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah!
- The Eagle has landed.
- Hmm?
The horse is in the barn.
The chicken...
is in the pot.
Look here, man, I don't know nothin' about no eagles landing' and all of that.
I don't know nothin' about no horse running' through the barn.
And I certainly don't know nothin' about no... chickens bein' in the pot.
You understand?
But if you do me a favour... as to be so kind as to cash this cheque right there,
- I could be on my way.
- Wait.
- Quigley sent you?
- That's right.
- What about the kid?
- What kid?
Man...
The kid!
The kid with the backpack!
Look here, man.
I'm tired of tellin' you this.
But if you don't give me the money for that cheque,
I guarantee there's a bullet with your name on it in this chamber.
[Moaning] The kid with the backpack.
The kid with the backpack!
The backpack!
The backpack!
Shit!
Oh, my god!
[Quigley] 150 grand, cash.
- It's my last offer, guys.
- [Woman] You're our Realtor.
You tell us.
This offer is so much less than our asking price.
Well, Mrs Appleton, it really is a buyer's market.
Do you mind if we take a minute to think about it?
Listen, I got all the time in the world, sweetheart.
Too bad I can't say the same for you two.
Applesauce, what's with the long face, my man?
I bought your pad.
You've got some cash.
It's a beautiful thing.

- Groovin' thing, man.

- What kind of hustle is this?
And what's with your voice, pal?
Sore throat-itis.
[Computer Coughs]
Yeah.
I'll tell you what.
One-seventy right now, cash, and I walk away.
- You take it or leave it right now.
- Ask the box.
One-eighty, plus closing costs.
- One-eighty, - [Preston] Top that, sucker.
Plus closing costs.
- One-ninety, darlin'.
Top that.
- Preston, honey?
I have a few errands to run.
I'll be back by 2:00.
Okay.
Bye, Mom.
- [Computer] Two hundred.
- Two-ten.
- Just to be safe, make that 3:00.
- [Laughs]
- Three hundred?
- Ma, you're killin' me on this deal.
Come on.
Are you tellin' me we're gonna sit here and listen... to some talking box with a robot voice?
What is this?
Uh, 300 it is.
Are you prepared to top 300?
No, I don't think I'm prepared to top 300!
Are you out of your mind?
We had a deal here!
Are you Realtors just a bunch of crooks?
Is that it?
What's going on with you people?
Well, I am sorry you feel that way, but I have an offer on the table of 300.
- [Computer] Thousand.
- Uh, we'll take it.
- Sold.
- Yeah.
You probably won't live to enjoy the cash.
[Realtor] Just one thing, sir.
What is your name?
My name is Preston...
Bingo.
Macintosh.
My name is Macintosh.
Well, congratulations, Mr Macintosh.
- You have a house.
- Yes!
I'm rich!
Yeah!
Whoo, yes!
Yeah!
Money!
Money!
- You did what with my money?
- [Juice] You're not gonna believe this.
He gave all your money to a little old bitty boy.
That was my nest egg.
That's all I had to start a new life.
I worked hard to steal that money, Biderman!
You gave it to some zit-faced little kid?
Now wait a minute.
I seen the kid.
- His skin looked pretty smooth.
- The boy had a cheque signed by you.
I didn't write a cheque to anybody except for this genius here.
Now hold on a minute.
I'm not the one who cashed a cheque for a million dollars.
- That was this man right here.
- Had your signature.
I said I didn't write it!
You gave me the cheque-book,
I put it in my pocket, I got in my car, I... I...
I can't feel my legs.
Uh, I...
Oh, oh, oh.
Calm down.
I've got a surveillance photo of the boy.
[Stammering] We'll find him in no time.
- Oh, yeah, that's him.
- I can't see a thing.
I recognize him.
I'd know him anywhere.
It's upside-down.
All right.
So where are you gonna find the kid, Mr Family Man?
- Newspapers.
- You want me to advertise, is that it?
No, no, no.
They have listings.
Uh, family activities where, where...
You know, things where kids go.
See?
Fine.
You're gonna help me find him.
- You understand?
Dead or alive.
- Uh-huh.
Let's get out of here.
- Oh, don't think you ain't comin' with us.
- [Gasping]
Somebody's in there with Biderman now.
A couple of guys I've never seen before.
They've just left.
The money laundering is definitely on again.
We've got to notify the Bureau right away.
[Man] Hello, Limousines Unlimited.
- You have the car keys?
- No, you have the car keys.
- Oh, yeah.
You make sure you-know-who stays grounded.
- And he goes to bed early.
- You got it, Pops.
- Don't call me that.
Uh, excuse me.
Sorry, kid.
Nobody famous inside.
Do you want to take your mitts off the car, please?
- I'm waitin' for a client here.
- But I'm your client.
Oh, right, yeah.
And I'm Madonna.
Sorry, kid.
The boss doesn't like me taking baseball cards as payment.
So if you want to ride in this, you need some buckaroos, buckarinis, some moola, some dinero, some money, some frogskins, much similar to the money you've given me...
In fact, identical to the money you've given me right now.
I was just kiddin' about bein' Madonna.
- My name's Henry.
- Hi, Henry.
I'm Preston.
- Preston, good to see ya.
- Preston Waters.
Yes, nice to meet ya.
Hop in.
Go ahead.
I didn't actually mean hop in, but...
So, where to, boss?
- Well, Harry, we're gonna go buy some stuff.
- Yes, sir.
[Tyres Screeching]
"Hey, yeah"
"Ow, whoo"
"The best things in life are free"
"But you can keep them for the birds and bees"
- "Now give me money" - "That's what I want"
- "That's what I want, yeah" - "That's what I want"
- "That's what I want Yeah" - "That's what I want"
"That's what I want"
"Baby, your lovin' gives me a thrill"
"But your lovin' never paid my bills"
- "Now give me money" - "That's what I want"
- "That's what I want" - "That's what I want"
- "That's what I want" - "That's"

- "That's what I want" - "Ow, hey"
- Ice cream!
Turn around, Henry.
- Oh, right on.
"I need some money, baby I need some money"
"I just need a few"
- Hey, thanks a lot for the great watch.
- You're welcome.
- Hey, this guy, uh...
What is it?
Mclntyre?
- Macintosh.
Uh, Macintosh.
Yeah, yeah.
If you don't mind me askin', where does he get his money?
Well, he doesn't get it, he just has it.
Why does he get a kid like you to go out and buy all this stuff for him?
He...
He never had a real childhood.
So now that he's really, really rich, he can have all the fun that he couldn't have when he was a kid.
- Oh.
Oh, I see.
- You know.
So he didn't have any fun when he was a kid, but now he's old and he's got money.
You're a kid having the fun for him now... that he couldn't have when he was a kid.
- Okay, sure.
- Stop!
Pull over, Henry!
It's Shay!
- Stop!
Hey!
- [Shay Screams] You scared me!
- Sorry.
- Preston, right?
- You've got a good memory.
- Thanks.
- Great, kid.
Very nice.
- Nice wheels.
Oh, this?
Ah, it's my boss, Mr Macintosh.
- Do you want a ride?
- No, thanks.
I'm outta shape.
Not from where I'm sittin' you aren't.
So, uh, I'm thinkin' about comin' into the bank tomorrow...
- and opening my account.
- Wow, you got the $200 already?
- Just about.
- All right.
Well, see you tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Was that him?
Was that Biderman?
- No, some kid who came into the bank today.
- Nice wheels for a kid.
Yeah.
Says it belongs to his boss, a guy named Macintosh.
Macintosh.
When are we gonna see Biderman?
[Man] It looks like a circus.
Hey.
Hey, hey, move it.
I've got work to do too, you know.
Where am I supposed to go?
You see an opening?
Huh?
Hey, what's the holdup here?
- Yeah, same to you, buddy.
- Hey, move it!
What is all this?
What a mess.
This is absolute madness!
Yo, who's in charge here?
[Preston Over Speaker] You with the race car, put it in the backyard.
Uh, the water slide goes back by the pool.
You guys with the TVs, put them in the living room.
Hey, you with the Cadillac, out by the pool.
You in the green jumpsuits, bring that around the back.
- Preston?
- Hi, Dad.
- What's going on here?
- Movin' in.
- Who is moving in?
- Macintosh.
- Who's Macintosh?
- I'll be right with you, Dad.
Come on, boys.
I don't have all day.
Okay, Mr Waters, the security system is all in place.
Excuse me.
This is the remote.
Here are the instructions.
All right?
We appreciate Mr Macintosh's business.
Here you go, pal.
What's with all the security?
Mr Macintosh says you can never be too paranoid, Dad.
- Well, who is Macintosh?
- I work for him.
He's paying me.
Yeah, but who is he?
I never met him.
- You mean you haven't met him?
- No, I haven't met him.
- He's heard about you.
- Really?
Yeah, about work and stuff.
Really good things.
- Well...
His stuff is blocking our driveway.
- Dad.
Boys!
Could you clear a path, please?
Get a move on it!
All set, Dad.
"I knew a guy who was tough but sweet"
[Henry] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
"He's the one He can't be beat"
"He's got everything that I desire"
- "Sets the summer sun on fire"
- Brake, brake!
"I want candy"
- "I want candy"
- Flip, flip, flip, flip, flip!
- "Yeah" - [Game] Body blow.
Uppercut.
- Body blow.
Left hook.
Uppercut.
Body blow.
- Ow.
- Uppercut.
- Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
Body blow.
Ten, nine...
- "I want candy"
- Yeah!
Yes!
"I want candy"
"Go to see him when the sun goes down"
- Come on, Henry!
Come on!
- "Ain't no finer boy in town"
- Hey!
Whoa!
- "I want candy"
- Oh, Henry!
- "I want candy"
- The blood rushed to my head.
- "Hey"
"Hey"
"Hey"
"Hey, hey"
[Woman] Is something wrong?
No.
I was wondering who could spend cash like that these days.
Oh, yeah.
The man's name is Macintosh.
- Macintosh?
- Mm-hmm.
He just moved here.
- Apparently loaded.
- Apparently.
I don't feel good about being here.
People may get the wrong idea.
Really?
You don't feel good?
How do you think I felt when you gave away my million dollars, huh?
Juice.
See anybody that looks like him?
Oh, yeah.
He looks like him.
Uh, she looks like him right there.
Way back over there, uh, there goes his little twin brother.
You give me one picture and expect me to find him out of all these kids?
You must be crazy.
I'm gonna get on the water slide.
I'm startin' to sweat.
Hey, mister, you know where the refreshment stands are?
- [Pops Balloon]
- No.
[Girl Crying]
Boom, boom, boom!
I got you!
Boom, boom, boom, boom!
[Electronic Gunfire]
- [Butch Whimpering]
- He says he knows you, boss.
Oh, well, just throw him out.
[Screaming] Ow!
Ow!
- Banzai!
- "I want candy"
- [Preston Screaming] - "I want candy"
"Hey"
"Hey"
- "Hey"
- Hiya.
I didn't expect to see you here.
- Oh, what you doin' here?
- I came by to see Mr Macintosh.
- Oh, no, he's in a meeting.
- That's okay, I'll wait.
I just really need to see him.
- He's in meetings all day.
- All day?
- Swamped.
- Hey, I missed you at the bank.
I thought you were gonna come by and see me about opening up an account.
- Oh, I had to work.
- Wow.
This is where you work?
- Not too shabby.
- Comfortable.
- I brought an application.
- Do you still want to open up an account with me?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Do you have your deposit?
- I'll go get it.
Okay.
Great.
[Preston Screaming]
- Whoa!
- That's amazing!
Sorry, just printed it.
Two hundred dollars.
Looks like you fell into some money, huh?
- I make a living.
- Yeah, well, I guess Mr Macintosh...
He knows a good man when he sees one.
- Will he be opening up an account with us?
- Uh, maybe.
Yeah?
Great.
You know, I'd love to meet him.
How's tonight?
- Uh, tonight.
What's tonight?
- Tonight's Wednesday.
Wednesday.
Wednesday.
I'm sorry, he's busy.
- Too bad.
- Uh, but I'm not.
Oh, I handle all his financial affairs.
- You do?
- Not all of them, but I can tell you a lot about him, sort of like a pre-meeting.
- And he wouldn't mind?
- Hasn't complained yet.
Okay.
I'll come by around 8:00.
Okay.
Wait, I could send a car for you.
Okay.
Cool.
It's a date then.
Bye-bye.
A date?
A date?
I've never been on a date.
You know what they call me downtown?
The Babe-Meister.
Think about it.
Okay, I'm gonna tell you about the real deal on dating, which I know.
First of all, women love a great body.
They love...
Look at this bod.
- Whoa.
See?
- Yeah, yeah.
Of course, you've got a bod now that's of a Greek god.
Really.
Think about it.
Women like you to have a good bod because they want to feel they're protected.
You might have to fight some guy, you know?
But not with those arms.
You don't want to hit a guy with those arms 'cause those pythons would take a guy's head off.
Seriously.
You're buff, but we're gonna get you chiseled.
Okay?
Oh, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm having a vision here of a date.
- The perfect date for you guys.
- Uh, Steak Heaven!
Ho, ho!
My little friend, you really have the hots for this one, huh?
You know, if you really want to go upscale, that all-you-can-eat salad bar...
women love that.
And take some with you.
You know, line your pockets with plastic bags.
Put the food in there. 'Cause it doesn't say "All you can eat here."
Does it say "here" on the sign?
I don't think so.
So you take something back for later.
A little snackaroo.
Oh, women love that.
You get home and you got a pocketful of hot wings.
There's nothing more that impresses a woman.
Get yourself some flowers.
Get yourself a great body, some nice hair, some good clothes, a car, and learn to say words like "noncommittal."
You are a date and a half, pal.
"There he is Some Tiny Tim"
"There he is Six foot and risin'"
"Ooh, there he is He's a knockout machine"
- "He's number one He's double cool"
- Yeah!
"He's the naked truth in magazines"
- "I believe in him" - "Wonderman"
- "He is a Mr Wonderman" - "Wonderman"
"He is a Mr Wonderman"
"Ah, yes"
- "Wonderman"
- Ew.
- "Wonderman"
- One more!
Yes, yes, yes!
Ah!
[Preston] Hey, I'm gonna get you!
[Henry] You are little sushi man.
Sushi man down.
Big boy throw.
Then they chase around.
Come around other way, fall down.
Splat.
- [Preston Screaming] - " Here comes the wonderman He'd like to say bye-bye"
- Why are you dressed like a game show host?
- I'm going out tonight.
Just a minute, young man.
You're still grounded.
- But it's for Mr Macintosh.
- I don't care.
Macintosh may have a pile of money, but he doesn't decide... when my son is or isn't grounded.
- But it's for my job.
- Your job is to be grounded.
- [Both] Grounded.
- So much for Plan 442.
What do you know about Plan 442?
Well, it's the investment plan you've been working on, your "prespectus."
Prospectus.
What are you doing going through my work?
Well, I didn't want to say it, but I told Mr Macintosh... about your Plan 442, and he was very, very interested.
Yep, I promised him I'd bring a copy of it tonight and show it to him.
But I didn't want to tell you just in case you got your hopes all up and...
No, no, no, no, no, of course not.
Let me get you a fresh copy of the "prespectus."
- I'll get a copy of it, sweetheart.
- Prospectus.
Yeah.
- Here.
You're welcome.
- Oh, thank you.
Hurry up.
Go.
Go!
You want the car keys?
Nah, that's okay, Dad.
I don't drive yet.
- [Dad] You want me to drive you?
- [Preston] No, it's okay.
You know, I still haven't met Macintosh.
Maybe I should go over and...
- No!
You'll ruin everything.
- Why not?
He has a date tonight and he's very nervous about it.
- I guess I can see him first thing in the morning.
- Oh, I don't know, Dad.
I mean, he might be up pretty late with this woman.
[Chuckles] Lucky dog.
Later, toads.
- [Groaning]
- Thank you.
That's enough.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
I can't believe Mr Macintosh went to all this trouble.
- This place is great.
- Mr Macintosh has been eating here for years.
Oh, yeah?
I thought he just moved here.
There was a Tangerino where I used to live.
Oh.
[Gargling]
Compliments of the chef for Mr Waters... and his lovely guest.
Th-They look like lobsters, only weenie.
Oh.
Mr Macintosh wanted you to have this too.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, wow.
This is beautiful.
Oh.
But I can't accept this from you.
But it's from Mr Macintosh.
- Why?
- Just a little business gift.
I mean, it's deductible, isn't it?
I'm not really sure, but it's way too expensive.
Mr Macintosh has a million dollars.
A million dollars doesn't buy all that much these days.
Do you think he should have asked for more?
What exactly does he do anyway?
Oh, a little of this, a little of that.
- You know.
- No, I'm afraid I don't.
- Oh, well...
- Is he an entrepreneur?
No, he's American.
Very secretive.
He has some questions for you too.
Okay.
Shoot.
- "Are you married?"
- No.
"What's the shortest guy you ever dated?"
Mmm.
I'm not really sure.
- "The youngest?"
- You know, these are pretty personal questions.
Well, Mr Macintosh is very interested in you.
- He is?
- He's, uh, never met anybody like you before.
He's never met me before, period.
Technically no, but he's been thinking a lot about you lately.
- He has?
- Yep.
Whoa!
Preston!
Are you okay?
- [Screaming] - [Gasps]
Do you like hamburgers?
I love hamburgers.
Never saw this kid before in my life.
This is a waste of time.
Come on.
What's so special about this place?
- You'll see.
- Mmm, come on.
Tell me.
- Okay.
- You gonna tell me?
- Come with me.
- All right.
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.
- See what?
- Okay, get in the middle.
- Okay, ready?
Five, four, three,
- Here?
Two, one.
[Shay Laughing] Holy smokes!
Okay!
Okay, now, come here, Shay!
- Okay, okay, now!
- Preston, I don't believe this!
Okay, now, let's run around!
- Don't get wet!
- Get us out!
Run!
[Screams]
- Okay, okay, okay!
- Watch out!
- No, we're gonna get soaked!
- No, no, no.
Now come...
Come around here!
Come around here!
Come on!
- Okay, hold onto me.
- [Screaming] Hey, where are you?
[Screaming] Yeah!
Yes!
- Whoo, yeah!
- Preston!
[Clapping, Cheering]
This is a great idea, Biderman.
Where's all the kids, huh?
Carl, it's late at night.
All the little boys and girls are tucked in bed.
What do you expect?
What I expect is when I give someone a million dollars, and I come back a day later,
I find the million dollars.
That's what I expect.
- Carl, I'm not a magician.
- You can make it disappear,
- you just can't get it back, right?
- I'm telling you...
If y'all want a kid so bad, there go one over there.
[Biderman] That's the little boy from the bank!
Shh.
Shh.
- [Preston Screams]
- Go get him!
- Oh, I'll race ya to the limo!
I'll race ya to the limo!
- What?
Okay, I'll race ya!
[Shouting]
[Screaming]
- I got the door for ya!
- Open the door.
It's freezing!
Go, Henry!
Go, Henry, go!
- [Henry] Here we go!
- [Groaning]
He got away again!
I don't believe this!
He got away again!
[Screaming]
[Shay] This was the most fun.
- I haven't done anything like this since I was a little kid.
- Me neither.
Thank you so much.
When can I see you again?
Well, I really have to spend some time with my job right now.
Well, uh, I'm having a party.
On Friday.
Can you come?
It's for Mr Macintosh.
Um, it could be for your business, sort of.
Mr Macintosh will really be there?
Uh-huh.
It's his birthday.
Okay.
Well, great.
It's a date then.
Oh, I'm getting out up here.
It was really fun.
And, uh,
- I had such a good time.
- Me too.
- Good night, Preston.
- Good night, Shay.
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.
- Good night, ma'am.
Bye now.
It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.
[Henry] So you're having a party Friday?
[Preston] Oh, yeah, it's Mr Macintosh's birthday.
Oh, I thought you said it was your birthday Friday.
Well, we're gonna have a joint party for the both of us.
Oh.
Well, it's a good thing it worked out your birthdays are around the same time.
Hey, you wanna move that horse?
Come on.
What is this, Bonanza?
Let's go!
Well, here we are.
Home at last.
- Thanks, Henry.
- My pleasure.
Hey!
Preston Waters!
- Good night.
- You know what you got, pal?
- What?
- S-T-Y-L-E.
- Style.
Good night, Henry.
- Style.
Good night.
Take it easy, man.
Good night.
Macintosh and I are having the biggest birthday party ever.
- Honey, where's Preston?
- He's working for Macintosh.
Oh.
Where's Damien and Ralph?
They're working for Macintosh too.
Oh.
- Have you met Macintosh?
- No, I thought you met him.
- No, I haven't met him.
- Well, I haven't met him either.
[Machine Humming]
Keep 'em comin'.
Mr Macintosh wants me to get plenty of practise.
[Screams] Watch where you're hittin' those!
Quit messin' around.
Macintosh is watching.
Where?
We've still never seen him.
Just get back to work.
He's watching.
- " [Loud Rock] - [Man]... coming out of the garage.
Ruining the neighbourhood.
"[Continues]
[Shooting Noises]
[Henry] Hey, Preston!
Your party planner's here again.
[Woman] Piston!
Piston!
Piston!
Turn off this contraption.
I have wonderful news.
Mr Macintosh's birthday is going to be the event of the century.
We gonna make the front page from coast to coast.
Oh, we are so lucky, lucky, lucky!
Now what kind of food does Mr Macintosh like?
- I don't know.
- And who are his friends?
- Do you have a guest list?
- Uh, I don't think so.
You know, dewdrop, I think I should meet him because...
I'm gonna need a little cash deposit.
Oh.
Uh, here.
Let me get you some cash.
Ooh, yes, you do have money, don't you?
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Careful walking around with this much money, darling.
Somebody could just rip you right off.
Now, this first $10,000 is going to be the deposit.
Now, of course, I'll get the balance at the party, and Mr Macintosh is good for it?
I am just so looking forward to meeting him.
- Who isn't?
- Waiters, security,
- guest list, paparazzi...
- Oh, and Yvonne?
- Yes?
- Remember, it's Preston.
Whatever!
Hey, uh, hey, Henry.
[Grunting, Laughing] It's attack of the 50-foot chauffeur from hell!
I was just wondering if you wanted to play some video games.
Oh, man, I wish you'd have said something.
I can't.
I promised some friends I was gonna meet 'em in a while.
Oh, okay.
No problem.
I'll tell you what.
I'll drop you over at one of your friend's place... on the way over, and you can have some fun there.
Nah.
Maybe I'll go to the park.
All right.
It's up to you.
Hey, Preston,
- is my tie straight?
- Well, it looks perfect.
All right.
Later.
- Over here.
- Over here!
There it is.
That's the park up ahead.
Where did all these kids come from?
Keep driving and maybe someday I'll tell you.
- How could you hit a kid?
- I didn't hit a kid.
I ran over his bicycle.
I had a dog once that got hit by a train.
- Thanks for sharing, Juice.
- Old King Cole we called him.
- He was a merry old soul.
- It's him.
- Boy with the backpack.
- Go!
Go!
Go!
- The sign says "No Cars Allowed"!
- Just drive!
Quigley!
- You're gonna pay for this!
- Just drive!
- Carl, this isn't a good idea.
- Shut up!
Whoa!
Let go, man.
What's goin' on?
- Oooh!
- Oooh!
- I'm gonna get him.
- We're gonna tear him up!
- Reach over there and get him!
- Your butt is mine, kid!
I've been wantin' this little punk.
I own you!
I own you, kid!
Come here!
He's got my money!
Aaaah!
- Follow him on foot!
Go!
- Follow him on foot?
- Do I look like a bloodhound, a professional tracker?
- Juicy, listen.
If we don't get that kid, nobody gets paid.
[Groaning]
- I want cash benefits, dental, everything.
- Not a problem.
Insurance!
Here, kiddie, kiddie!
Oh, there you go.
Come here, boy.
I'm gonna get you now.
I've been lookin' for you!
Huh?
Oh, no.
There he goes.
Yes.
Come here, boy!
I'm gonna get you now!
Aaaah!
Don't believe this!
Kill that kid when I find him.
I'm not gettin' paid for this.
- Where are we going now?
My hands are over my eyes.
- Shut up!
- Get out...
- [Screaming]
There he is!
Stick with it!
I got ya!
[Juice] I'll get you!
Hang on, hang on.
- Okay, there he is!
- Come here!
Come here!
- Juice!
Run after him.
- You must be crazy.
You run after him.
- Just ran through this whole entire park.
- Fine, get in the car.
- [Coughing]
- Don't blow chunks in my car.
I just had it detailed.
- I'm cool!
- Are you sure?
Are you sure?
- I'm not gonna mess up your priceless detail.
- Come on.
- [Retching]
- Hey!
[Boy] Wow, what's this?
- Let's go!
- After him!
- Hey, dude!
- [Juice] Move outta the way.
Sorry!
- Get 'im!
- Your butt is mine!
I want this kid...
What are you doing?
- Yeah!
- No!
Carl, watch out!
[Juice] Oh, no!
Whoa!
- Aah!
No!
- Oh, man!
Yes!
Now that's a display of fine driving right there.
You know, Carl, it might be easier just to steal another million dollars.
Hello, Mr Jackson.
Well, well, well, if it isn't the world's youngest personal injury attorney.
You know, you're in a lot of trouble today, little man.
Yeah, 'cause today I have been drinking vodka.
- Take a hike, butt-brain.
- What?
- Take a...
- Never mind, never mind.
Never mind, never mind!
[Chattering]
[Yvonne] Antoine, get that truck thing off the stage.
Thank you!
Get those golden gloves off!
Thank you!
Love, love, love, love!
What do you think?
Ta-da!
Is this to die, or what?
Uh, yeah, sure, it's, uh, to die.
I can't wait to show it to Mr Macintosh.
Come on, honey, let's see what they did with that...
"Is it to die for or what?" [Laughing]
Where did you find her?
Oh, man.
- What does this cost?
- I don't know.
- What do you think it should cost?
- Lots, lots.
Kid, why don't you just tell me what I need to know.
I'm a good guy.
Okay, how good are you going to be to me?
In round numbers.
I don't think you get the picture, sonny.
- Maybe you need a better view.
- [Screaming]
[Screaming] Preston Waters, 1508 Oak Street, Hillsdale, Indiana!
- Thank you.
- [Crying]
- You all right?
- Aaah!
Aaah!
- Is something wrong?
- No, not at all.
- Is Mr Macintosh around?
- Uh, no.
- But he will be here tonight?
- Yeah.
- In person?
- In person.
- Okay.
I'll see you tonight?
- Okay.
Okay.
You're looking good.
Bye.
- I'll be calling.
- What a babe.
Baby brother comes into his own.
For a little weasel, he sure knows how to get a girlfriend.
- Too bad he picked a fortune hunter.
- Little love pilot... shot down in flames by a gold digger.
By a what?
Gold digger, someone who is only after money.
I know women, and that one is after Macintosh's cold, hard cash.
For your information, me and Shay already went on a date... and she had one fantastic time, boys.
Oh, yes, every second she was getting closer...
- and closer to Mr Macintosh.
- [Laughing]
- Shut up!
- Just answer me this.
Did she ever, ever just once, come by without saying,
"Meanwhile, I wonder if I could see Mr Macintosh?"
She's a gold digger, man.
She just wants Macintosh's money.
- Yeah!
Ow!
- Don't rub it.
Be a man.
- Don't rub it.
- I'll rub it if I want to.
- She wants a guy with money, not some little kid with an empty piggy bank.
- Yeah.
"Well, I'll wait by the windows I'll wait by the door"
"To make sure you don't come home"
- You ever known any gold diggers?
- Man, have I.
I hate 'em.
They're the worst.
Anybody who is your friend because you have money is not your friend at all.
You know what they say about gold?
"He who has the gold makes the rules"?
No, no, no.
"A fool and his gold are soon parted."
What does that mean?
"A fool and his gold are soon parted." Those old sayings, man,
I don't get 'em.
I don't even know really what that means.
You ever heard:
"More than one way to skin a cat"?
Who skins cats?
Why would you skin a cat?
And there is not more than one way to skin a cat.
There is only one way.
You grab the cat, you rip the skin off the cat.
What is the number two way?
You put a hose up the cat's butt?
He gets so bloated that he skins himself?
Does he have a piece of Velcro under his butt?
No.
"Kill two birds with one stone." You heard that one?
You know anyone who has even killed one bird with one stone?
Kids try it all the time.
You can't hit a bird with a stone.
Unless you got a huge stone and they're tiny baby birds.
Then... [lmitating Crash] Beep, beep!
Dead.
[Sighing] "A fool and his gold are soon parted."
I guess it means that if you're a fool, your gold or your money is soon gone.
Once it's gone, it is outta there.
It is history.
It is dust.
It is vapour.
It is no more.
You are living in Brokesville.
- Unless you have Macintosh's kind of money.
- What if you don't?
I guess then you find out who your real friends are.
Man, we look good.
- Is everybody having a good time?
- [Woman Laughing]
- Good, you are.
- "Yes, we are, darling." Wow, look at the balloons.
- This is great.
Look at the ice sculpture.
- Presents!
Hey, hey, hey, kid, no touching.
Those are Mr Macintosh's.
Go find your parents.
Go on, get outta here.
Go on!
- I just want to see Mr Macintosh.
- I just want to pig out.
[Chuckling] Hey, look at that.
Excuse me.
- Sorry!
- Exactly who are you looking for, Preston?
- Have you seen Shay?
- I haven't seen her, but she'll be around.
Come on...
Oh, man, look at all this food!
Macintosh doesn't show, we bring the kid in, agreed?
If Preston says Macintosh is gonna be there, Macintosh will be there.
But you don't make a move, until I give you the signal, understood?
We got eight men ready to go in and nail him the second he shows up!
We close this deal tonight!
Where's the pizza and the ice cream?
What's going on here?
This could have been a pizza before it got run over by a couple of trucks.
Oh, that looks tasty.
Looks like something you'd find between your toes.
Ah, ah, ah!
It's sucking the life outta me!
- Shut up!
Everybody's looking.
- So what?
Who cares?
Relax, have a good time.
She'll show up.
Oh, there's Shay now.
Ha!
Just kidding.
I was kidding ya!
Would you just relax?
She'll be here.
It's not at all what you thought it'd be like?
Hate being rich, huh?
Preston?
Preston?
Ice cream, ice cream.
Yoo-hoo, Preston!
Now, where is our mystery man?
It's time for Mr Macintosh to make his appearance.
I like to give my employers their bills directly.
That way if they have any questions or heart attacks or something...
- I'll give it to him.
- Fine.
Be quick about it.
$100,000?
Sweetheart, I know this seems like a whole lot of money to normal people like me and you, but to a man like Macintosh this is just pennies.
- Now, you get up there and get me my money!
- Ow!
I'll get your money.
[Computer Beeping]
Party: $100,000.
Not a problem.
You can leave it.
This is fine.
I'll be right back.
Thank you.
[Computer] Transaction not possible.
Insufficient funds.
Current balance: $332.17.
- Transaction not possible.
- Three hundred dollars?
- Insufficient funds.
Transaction not possible.
- Oh, no!
- No, please, God.
- Insufficient funds.
This can't be right.
One, two, three, four...
[Chattering]
It's gone.
It's all gone.
[Knocking]
Mr Macintosh?
Oh, sorry to bother you.
It's Fred Waters, Preston's dad.
I know you got a bash going on here, so I'll make it brief.
But, uh,
I wanted to ask you a favour.
You see, today is Preston's birthday and if you see him, if you could send him home a little early.
Lately he's been working so hard.
All of a sudden money's become so important to him.
I guess that's mostly my fault.
You don't have kids, do you, Mr Macintosh?
I'll tell you, it's very easy to make mistakes with them.
I haven't always paid enough attention to my kids.
I pushed them too hard... maybe.
Especially Preston.
I guess I expect more from him.
He reminds me of myself at that age.
I couldn't wait to grow up.
I'm afraid he's missing out on his childhood.
So am I.
Well, thanks.
I won't take up any more of your time.
And we appreciate you sending Preston home early.
If...
If he wants to come, that is.
- [Whispering] I want to come home.
- Thanks.
Dad.
Dad?
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad, wait!
Daddy!
Henry?
Henry!
Wait a minute, where's Henry?
Your driver?
He left a little while ago.
H-He left?
You sure it was Henry?
Big guy, white limo.
He's gone.
Thanks.
Now I know who my friends are.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
- [Door Opening] - [Shay] Preston?
Mr Macintosh?
- Mr Macintosh?
- It's just me.
- Which one of us did you want?
- I was looking for you.
- Oh, good.
- And Mr Macintosh.
Look, it's very, very important that I find Mr Macintosh right now.
- Do you understand?
- He's nowhere.
- He's gone.
I think you'd better leave too.
- Preston...
- you could be in danger.
- Just go, okay?
You got your necklace.
Just take it and leave.
"Give it back There's no time to lose"
"So give it back Give it back"
Riggs?
Riggs?
Riggs?
Looks like no one's home.
- Shut up, Wienerman.
- Biderman.
- Where is he?
- I don't know, but he might be down the street... at Mr Macintosh's, that's his boss.
- Macintosh.
Come on!
- [Whimpering]
You know, I do like what they have done with this colour.
There you are, puppy-butt.
Did you get me my money?
- Uh, Macintosh has disappeared.
- What?
Now, I am warning you, Tom Thumb, don't you trifle with me.
If I don't get paid, I will sue Mr Macintosh... for every dime he is worth!
Well, be sure and tell me when you find him.
Okay, little Mr Man, this party is over!
Quiet!
Stop that playing!
Stop that music!
Quiet!
Attention!
Attention!
Everybody, this party is over!
Our host...
can't pay his bills!
- Mr Macintosh is a fraud!
- [Woman] What?
[Crowd Murmuring] Who's that kid?
She's right.
Hate to tell you this, but there's been a terrible mistake.
Nobody s-should have been invited.
Macintosh is... is gone.
And he's not coming back.
So I think you should all leave too, so go.
Go on.
Close down the bar!
Come on, let's get outta here.
Come on, Antoine.
Move it!
Come on, move it!
Come back with those glasses!
Give me that!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
[Knocking]
Henry?
Henry!
I knew you'd come back!
Henry...
[Gasping]
Happy birthday.
I'm here to blow out your candles.
- Oh!
Let me go!
- What's your hurry, kid?
Got a big cheque to cash?
- Let me go!
- I like this pad.
What do you think, Juice?
Oh, yeah, I like the pad.
It looks real nice.
- Can you handle it?
Got the TV, drums.
- Oh, I like this.
- TV, drums.
- All kinds of toys.
- He's got a little taste, a little flavour.
- What's this thing here?
- I don't think I've seen one of those before.
- How do you work this?
Well, you turn the knob...
You really shouldn't let him in such a nice house as this.
All your stuff could get broken.
Kid, where's Macintosh?
N-Nowhere.
He's nowhere.
I'm going to ask you one more time.
Where is he?
Huh!
There is no Macintosh.
- I made him up.
It was me the whole time.
- Don't give me that.
- Who bought this house?
- I-I did.
You?
You outbid me?
Wait a minute.
You tryin' to tell me that this little boy here... outbid you with your own money?
Be a fly on the wall, okay, Juice?
Listen, kid, you know it's illegal to take things that don't belong to you.
I know.
I feel awful.
Take me to the police.
- Carl, don't do it.
It's a trick.
- Get outta here.
Son, I don't want to take you to the police.
Just tell me, okay?
Where's my money?
I-I spent it.
- All of it?
- All of it.
How could you spend... a million dollars in six days?
You must not have been shopping lately.
Carl, Carl, wait a minute.
Maybe we're thinking about this Macintosh thing in the wrong way.
- What are you talking about?
- You needed a new house, a new identity.
This kid, he's done it for you.
I mean, Macintosh could run for mayor here.
Yeah, I kind of like the idea of that...
Mayor Quigley.
No, no, Mayor Macintosh.
I like it.
Look, there's only one problem with that.
The...
Aaah!
- Hey!
- Come back here!
- Wait for me!
I'm coming!
- He's upstairs, man!
Break it down!
Break it down!
There he is!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
- He went down there!
- Juice, go after him!
- I ain't goin' down there.
- Go on!
Now!
- You're crazy.
I ain't goin' down there.
- Watch your head.
- What is it, about 230...
Whoa!
- Aaah!
- I'm not goin' in there.
- Oh, no, he didn't.
- Did you see him?
- Oh, no, you did just push me in the pool!
- Get out, we gotta find him!
What?
What happened?
Act like you got a purpose in life.
Go.
[Biderman] I think I'm experiencing chest pains.
[Indistinct Noise]
Carl?
Juice?
Huh?
Oh.
Little boy?
Little boy from the bank?
Ha, ha.
Oh!
[Groaning, Grunting]
Where am I?
Oh-oh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
[Sheep Bleating, Cow Mooing]
[Muttering]
[Rooster Crowing]
- Hey, hey!
- [Cow Mooing]
Got ya!
Uh-huh!
- Hey!
- Got him.
It's time for a little batting practise.
Here we go!
Hey!
What's happening?
Whoa!
Hey!
Just outside.
Let's try a sinker.
A sinker!
Another!
Another!
Let's try a screwball!
- Turn, turn, turn!
- Be cool!
Ow!
Hey!
Ho!
Come on, boy!
Screwball!
Boom!
Whoa!
Oooh!
- That must have hurt!
- My god!
Fastball, fastball!
Just inside!
- Oooh!
Ow!
- What's next, Juice?
How about tennis?
It's over, kid.
Ow!
Ow!
Preston, come out, come out, wherever you are.
None of this would have happened, you know, if you hadn't been a bad boy!
Tell me something, did you think you were going to get away with it?
Spending somebody else's hard-earned money?
Huh!
We need to have a chat.
Preston...
I'm not mad any more.
I know you're sorry.
Come on, buddy.
Pres?
Come on out now!
Banzai!
Quigley, I'll be back in a minute.
Don't leave me here...
Oh, where am I goin'?
- Whoa!
Kid!
- Don't you move.
Juice!
Biderman!
Get your useless butt over here!
[Motor Revving, Tyres Screeching]
Whoa!
Oh!
Oh!
Kid!
Kid!
What are you doin'?
Oh!
Oh!
Kid, kid, stop, please, please!
Stop!
Oh!
[Groaning]
Kid, please!
Don't do that!
Ooooh!
[Screaming]
Quigley?
Are you okay?
Aaah!
I got you now!
Come get him!
I got him now.
Come get him, you guys.
All right, hold him.
- Baseballs!
- You're not a very nice boy, you know that?
- Freeze!
- Preston, are you okay?
What's this all about?
What's happening here?
Stanley?
What are you doing here?
- Let go!
- As of this moment, you're fired from my bank!
F.B.I., Biderman.
From this moment, you're fired from your bank.
- What?
- You're with the F.B.I.?
- Yes, Preston, I am.
- Okay, kid, finally, at long last, who's Macintosh?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...
- I'm Macintosh.
- You're Macintosh?
I'm Macintosh!
And I want you all off my property now!
- He's Macintosh.
- You sure?
I tell ya, I'm Macintosh!
Please tell these guys I'm Macintosh.
- Oh, he's Macintosh.
Don't you know Papa Macintosh?
- Mr Macintosh.
And Big Mama Macintosh be hangin' out with the brothers.
Mr Macintosh, you're under arrest for fraud, money laundering and grand theft.
- What are you talking about?
- Bring in Biderman too.
- I'm a banker!
- And take Mr Wise Guy too.
- Who?
Me?
I'm not wise.
- Get your hands off me.
- Man, I flunked recess.
- Take it easy, man.
- Take 'em out.
- I'm not even from here, man.
- I'm a banker.
- I was roaming down the street.
Cat said, Hey, there's a party.
- I own a bank!
Sir, stay behind the line there.
Everyone, just calm down, okay?
Honey, I'm gonna check this out, make sure that Preston's okay.
- You take the boys home.
- [Chattering]
- What's going on?
- Something to do with Macintosh.
The F.B.I. Is all over.
- Uh, have you seen my son, a little boy?
- He's inside with the F.B.I.
- Excuse me, excuse me, please.
Officer...
- Whoa, whoa!
- Nobody gets in there without a badge, sir.
- I'm looking for my son.
Kind of neat.
Can I see your badge?
Shay Stanley, F.B.I.
Cool.
Wait a minute.
So that means our date... was just for your...
just for your job?
Well, it started out like that.
I should have known.
Hey, you know, I wouldn't have traded that night for anything.
So when can I see you again, Shay?
Mmm, why don't you give me a call in, say, about ten years?
- Five.
- Seven.
- Six.
- Okay, it's a date.
Good night, Preston.
[Dad] Preston!
Preston?
Oh, my god, he's in shock.
Oh, oh, I'm fine, Dad.
I'm fine now.
Oh, I'm glad to see you.
- What's going on here?
- It's a long story.
- Well, why don't we go on home, you tell me all about it?
- Okay.
I want to say goodbye to a friend, okay, Dad?
Wow, this is just great.
I can't step out for a couple of seconds.
I miss all the action.
Thanks.
- Are you okay?
- I thought you left, man.
No, I didn't leave.
What did we say the party needed?
Ice cream, right?
I just went to get ice cream.
I don't know if I got the exact recipe, but I think I got it close.
- So?
- Hey, it's pretty close.
Well, I guess Macintosh is no more, huh?
It's too bad, because, uh, I really enjoyed working for him.
- I had a good time too...
- Do me a favour?
Next time you see him, tell him, uh, that I'm really gonna miss him.
I'll miss you too, Henry.
You're gonna do just fine.
See ya.
- Hey, Henry.
- Huh?
- Know what you have?
- What?
- S-T-Y-L-E, style.
- Style.
Hey, Preston, you're not gonna finish this ice cream, I guess, huh?
Well, no sense letting' this go to waste.
So, what happened?
Oh, well, uh, Macintosh wasn't...
He...
He wasn't who he thought he was.
- How do you mean?
- Well, he shouldn't have done what he did.
He shouldn't have fooled everybody.
I think you're right.
It's been a long night.
Better get on up to bed.
Yeah, I think I ought to get some sleep too, Dad.
And tomorrow, I'll tell you all about Mr Macintosh.
Sleep well, Preston.
[Group] Ta-da!
"Happy birthday to you"
"Happy birthday dear Preston"
"Happy birthday to you"
Make a wish.
You know what they say, "Be careful what you wish for."
Oh.
What else do I want?
I mean, I got everything... that I need right here.
On the other hand.
"I'll wait just a little more time"
"Just a little more time"
"To move in a new direction"
"I'll wait just a little more time"
"'Til you make up your mind"
"You know that you're needin' me too, yeah"
"Why now are you feeling so scared"
"And unwilling to be there"
"When someone's there for you"
"Why time has to be so unkind"
"For no reason but love has no measure"
"This is true"
"Oh, well, I know what I feel inside"
"I trust in love and what my heart tells me"
"Haven't I been good the way I should"
"I'm willing, I'm able I need you to give me a sign"
"Now, I'll wait just a little more time"
- "Just a little more time" - "Just a little more"

"Why are you leaving me now"
"Well, I know what I feel inside"

"I'll wait just a little more time"
Where are you?
Oh.
Hello, beautiful.
[Kissing Sound]
Did you miss me?
Dad, I've given this some thought... and I've decided that since Damien and Ralph have their own rooms, well, there's no reason why they should be bringing their junk into my room.
Well, how does that sound, Helen?
- [Gulping] - [Door Opening]
- Out of the way, stick boy!
- Hand Foot is here to stay.
- Oops, kicked your baby monkey.
- Get out of here, Ralph!
- Here, take this.
- Go away, Damien.
This is my room.
Was.
Now it's also the world headquarters of Hand Foot, Incorporated.
- Hand Foot all the way!
- Hand Foot, Hand Foot, Hand Foot!
- Hand Foot?
You guys aren't gonna make a dime.
- Okay, we'll use this.
- Yeah!
- Hey, that's my life savings!
- Consider yourself our silent partner.
- Yeah, say something and you're dead.
- Yeah.
- How's the big move going?
- Great.
- Good.
Come on, Ralph.
Gotta get to work.
Dad?
[Clears Throat]
Dad... well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've decided that...
- s-s-since Damien and Ralph have their own room...
- Preston, they need the space for their business.
- Not my space.
- Young man, in this family, industry gets rewarded.
While you're in here playing, your brothers are hard at work.
- Yeah, kissing' butt for money.
- [Ralph] Well, you know the golden rule.
- He who has the gold makes the rules.
- One day you'll have a job.
- When I was your age, I had my own business cleaning wheels.
- [Mimicking Dad]
I was pulling down 100 bucks a week polishing cars.
- You used to say 75.
- Well, you gotta think big, Preston.
- Surprise.
- [Brothers] Whoa, check it out.
Yeah, it's for your business.
We had a spare at the office.
- Damien, the speakers are out in the hall.
- How does it work?
It imitates human intelligence, like you guys.
- Preston, maybe you could teach your brothers how to use it.
- Not possible.
[Dad] The software will teach you how to do everything but make love to a woman.
- Now I know what program to get your father for Christmas.
- Mom!
- Oops!
Uh, here.
Let me help you with that.
- Preston, you're gonna be late...
- for Butch's birthday party.
- Who wants to celebrate Butch's birth?
- [Dad] It's important to get out of your room more.
- [Brothers] Our room.
Well, good luck, guys.
[Computer Beeps, Talks] Damien and Ralph sleep... butt to face, butt to face,
- butt to face,
- Huh?
- Who said that?
- Butt to face, butt to face,
- Type "Quit." Hit "Delete."
- Butt to face, butt to face, butt to face...
- Turn it off!
Pull the plug!
- Ow!
- Don't rub it.
Be a man.
- [Moaning] Ouch!
- Little wimp.
[Dad] Come on, Preston.
You don't want to be late for Butch's birthday party.
- Are you gonna have fun today?
- [Preston] How can I, Dad?
- I don't have any money.
- Now, look.
Here's a couple of bucks.
Ah, heck, you can have fun all day on that.
You don't get out much, do you, Dad?
[P.A.] Welcome to Fun Land.
Fun, fun, fun for everyone.
Welcome to Fun Land.
Fun, fun, fun for everyone.
- Hey.
Hey, man.
- Hey, Butch.
Hey, man.
Yeah!
Hey, what's up?
Oh, look.
It's Presto the Pesto.
- Hello, Butch.
- [Kids Laughing]
Oh!
- Tokens!
- [Kids Cheering]
- Give me 50.
It's my birthday.
- Fifty.
- Twenty-five, please.
- Twenty-five.
- Twenty-seven.
- Twenty-seven.
- Six, please.
- Six.
Six.
- Coming?
- I don't know.
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
- [Shouting]
- It's gonna be awesome!
- Yeah, let's go over here!
- This one!
- Hurry!
[Butch] Hey, Preston!
Hey, over here!
- Hey, Preston, how's your ostrich?
- Watch out!
Preston has an ostrich!
Hey, Preston, come with us!
- Just kidding!
- [Laughing]
[Groaning]
[Dad] Did you have fun at Butch's birthday party?
I have a question.
Are we broke?
- No, we just have to watch our spending habits.
- That's right.
Like when your mother calls her sister back East and talks for 97 minutes.
So if we're not poverty-stricken, there must be some other reason I'm so deprived.
- We're outta here!
Whoo!
- Goin' to the ball game.
- Can I go?
- We bought tickets, toad.
- [Mother] Damien!
- You need some cash?
- Nah, we got a bunch of change.
- Later, Preston.
It's not fair.
Why can't I have anything?
Well, Preston, they have jobs, and they've learned to save.
How can I save money if I don't have any?
A penny saved is a penny earned.
- What do you want for your birthday?
- Money... so I can pay to have Ralph and Damien knocked off.
Anything else?
Well, maybe we'll give him one of his birthday presents early.
A gift came from Grandma today.
Hmm.
What a rip-off!
It's a check for nothing!
I'm having a bad day.
Oh, your grandma just forgot to fill in how much it was for, but she signed it at the bottom, see?
It's a blank check.
- We'll just fill in the amount.
- How much did you get last year, honey?
A thousand.
- Ten dollars.
- Wait, Dad.
What about inflation?
- Oh, make it 11.
- [Muttering]
You'd be surprised how fast... eleven dollars can grow with interest.
Preston?
Preston?
[Preston] Eleven dollars... at 3.45 interest.
[Computer] Your account will reach... one million dollars... in 342,506 years.
I'm stuck here forever.
- [Dad] Lights out up there.
- Why?
My house, my rules.
"My house, my rules."
My own house.
[Yawning]
[Engine Stops, Car Door Shutting]
[Man] Dave, who needs assets?
I'm your asset.
- I'm a big asset.
Oh, c...
- [Man On Phone] I can't believe you.
Dave, Dave.
Come on, come on.
Why only borrow 150,000?
Our money is your money.
Round it off to two.
- Do I qualify?
- Of course you qualify for the loan, Dave.
We're golf partners.
- You don't look happy to see me.
- Quig...
- Quigley.
- Quigley.
That's funny.
I don't remember you stuttering on the witness stand.
- You just sang like a bird, didn't you?
- I had no choice, Carl.
- I mean, lying in court...
- You also pointed at me.
- That hurt.
- Well, I was under oath.
- I mean...
- Come here.
The only reason you're alive, Biderman, is I knew I might need you again someday...
like today.
Oh, sure.
You need a loan?
The rates are great now.
- And you get a toaster.
- I don't need a toaster.
Before I went away, I put aside a little nest egg.
[Gasping] These bills, they're marked consecutively.
- They'd trace these in a minute.
- That's right.
- [Coughing]
- That's where you come in, old buddy.
I want new bills.
- We're back in the SL business, Biderman.
- Ah, money laundering...
- is very difficult these days, Carl.
- You still do it though, don't you?
That's a good-looking family right there.
You're not gonna hurt them, are you?
- Hate to have to.
- All right.
How do you want to do this?
- I'll send my guy in tomorrow with a check for a million.
- Tomorrow?
Yep, just like the old days.
You give him the cash, unmarked, send him on his way.
- Whom should I expect?
- Whom should...
Whom should you expect?
His name is Juice.
- Juice?
- Mmm, he'll be here in exactly 24 hours.
Let's call it 1:00.
Come on.
Walk me out.
Show a little respect.
Whoa.
I know how you feel.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Can you see okay?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, sure.
I would like to open an account, please.
Eleven dollars.
Do you have any other money you'd like to deposit, Mr Waters?
Oh, uh, I could, but it's sort of hard to save around my house; that's why I'm here.
I'm afraid we have a minimum balance.
It's $200.
Two hundred dollars?
That could take a million years.
Well, whenever you're ready, please come back and see me.
My name's Shay Stanley.
- Ask for me.
- Okay, I'll do that.
- Thanks.
- Bye-bye.
- I-I'll see you next time.
- I hope it's not in a million years.
B-Bye-bye.
[Biderman] Excuse me.
Carl, Carl!
Here.
You can use these checks.
They're temporary.
- Thank you, Edward.
- Like our relationship.
- Sucker!
- Give me that!
- [Laughing]
- Give it to me!
Butch, give it to me!
- Preston, come on!
- Butch!
- Give it back!
Whoa!
- If you can catch me!
Come on, Butch!
[Control Panel Dings, Engine Revs]
[Preston Screams]
- [Screaming] - [Tires Screeching]
Perfect.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
L...
I...
- Huh?
- [Butch] I saw the whole thing.
- I can be a witness if the price is decent.
- Get outta here.
He's perfectly all right, aren't you?
Aren't you?
- Yes.
- Good.
Get that thing out from underneath my car.
What about my bike?
- Kid, was I the one that parked there...
- Oh, my word!
- Are you all right?
- He's fine.
It was just a little accident.
He's okay.
- I think this guy's been drinking vodka.
- I have not been drink...
[Laughs] I don't drink at all.
Seriously, seriously.
Kid, talk to me.
How much you want for the bike?
- A thousand bucks.
- I'm not talking to you!
Bye, kid.
Go on.
Walk away.
What do you want, kid?
Name a figure, we'll discuss it.
Give this to your dad.
He'll know what to do with it.
I gotta go.
[Tires Screeching]
[Tire Squeaking]
Oh, man.
I thought we understood about taking care of our valuables.
Valuable?
It was a piece of junk.
If that's how you feel about a gift from your parents,
I don't see giving you a new one for your birthday.
I don't want a new bike.
I want my own room.
I'm warning you.
You're on thin ice as it is about the bike.
You know what I want?
What I want is my own house.
My rules, my money.
Listen, young man, until further notice, you're grounded.
What'd I do wrong?
[Sighs] Fred.
Hmm.
It's a blank check.
"[Computer Start-Up Tone]
Preston Waters.
Two hundred.
Hmm.
A thousand.
Hmm.
One million dollars.
Cash.
Whoa!
One million dollars.
[Electronic Zooming]
Hey, sonny.
Cashin' a big one today?
Uh, sort of.
Yoo-hoo.
Over here, young man.
- Well?
- I-I-I'd like to... cash this check, please.
Oh, a comedian.
[Laughing]
- N-No, ma'am.
- Okay, then we better take it to Mr Biderman.
Come on!
- [Ticking] - [Door Opening]
Excuse me, Mr Biderman.
We have a little problem here.
What is it, Mrs Udowitz?
- Someone thinks this is some kind of game.
- What?
Let me see that.
I see.
Is there much of a line out there, Mrs Udowitz?
- Yes, we're swamped.
- Then what are you doing here?
Please.
[Door Closes]
- Juice?
- No, thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Not thirsty.
Mr Quigley give you this check?
He did.
How did you run into Mr Quigley?
I didn't.
He ran into me.
Aha.
[Snickering]
[Laughing] Brilliant.
Brilliant!
- [Groans]
- I suppose you want big bills.
Actually, regular size would be okay.
Regular.
Hmm.
That's cute.
Put your backpack on the table.
Hey, hey.
I assume you know what to do with this.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
Next!
Look here, sweetheart.
Mmm, you're lookin' kind of good there.
You got your pearls and everything on.
Hate for something to have to happen to 'em.
Look here, my name is Juice... and I got something right here, and I wondered... if you'd be so kind enough as to cash it for me.
What do you want?
A million bucks?
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.
[Sighs] Go see Biderman.
Mm-mm.
Oh, my goodness gracious.
Here we go.
Here we go.
You tell Mr Quigley that he hasn't lost his touch.
- Uh-huh.
- All right.
You can go now.
Hey, kid!
- Stay away from the racetrack.
- Yes, sir.
Good one, man.
Looking good.
Mmm.
Oh!
Excuse me, sweetie.
[Gasps]
- What's wrong with you, little boy?
- [Preston] I'm sorry.
Don't be messin' up a view as good as all that.
- I-I'm sorry.
- What you doin' out of school anyway, huh?
You know you oughta be in school.
Go on and get up outta here before I start to get upset.
Hurry up.
How, uh...
How may I help you, sir?
I'm big Juice, man.
Quigley sent me.
Everything is fine.
- Not to worry.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah!
- The Eagle has landed.
- Hmm?
The horse is in the barn.
The chicken...
is in the pot.
Look here, man, I don't know nothin' about no eagles landing' and all of that.
I don't know nothin' about no horse running' through the barn.
And I certainly don't know nothin' about no... chickens bein' in the pot.
You understand?
But if you do me a favor... as to be so kind as to cash this check right there,
- I could be on my way.
- Wait.
- Quigley sent you?
- That's right.
- What about the kid?
- What kid?
Man...
The kid!
The kid with the backpack!
Look here, man.
I'm tired of tellin' you this.
But if you don't give me the money for that check,
I guarantee there's a bullet with your name on it in this chamber.
[Moaning] The kid with the backpack.
The kid with the backpack!
The backpack!
The backpack!
Shit!
Oh, my god!
[Quigley] 150 grand, cash.
- It's my last offer, guys.
- [Woman] You're our Realtor.
You tell us.
This offer is so much less than our asking price.
Well, Mrs Appleton, it really is a buyer's market.
Do you mind if we take a minute to think about it?
Listen, I got all the time in the world, sweetheart.
Too bad I can't say the same for you two.
Applesauce, what's with the long face, my man?
I bought your pad.
You've got some cash.
It's a beautiful thing.
Su casa is soon to be mi casa.
You know what I'm saying?
- Groovin' thing, man.
- Yeah, well...
[Dial Tone]
- " [Start-Up Tone] - [Sighs]
[Phone Ringing]
- Hello.
- [Computer] Good afternoon.
...your house.
- [Computer Beeps]
I'd like to make a cash offer on your house.
Someone else wants to make an offer.
What?
On this dump?
- Uh, hello, sir.
Can you hear me?
- Who is this yo-yo?
[Typing]
- [Computer] One-sixty.
- What kind of hustle is this?
And what's with your voice, pal?
Sore throat-itis.
[Computer Coughs]
Yeah.
I'll tell you what.
One-seventy right now, cash, and I walk away.
- You take it or leave it right now.
- Ask the box.
One-eighty, plus closing costs.
- One-eighty, - [Preston] Top that, sucker.
Plus closing costs.
- One-ninety, darlin'.
Top that.
- Preston, honey?
I have a few errands to run.
I'll be back by 2:00.
Okay.
Bye, Mom.
- [Computer] Two hundred.
- Two-ten.
- Just to be safe, make that 3:00.
- [Laughs]
- Three hundred?
- Ma, you're killin' me on this deal.
Come on.
Are you tellin' me we're gonna sit here and listen... to some talking box with a robot voice?
What is this?
Uh, 300 it is.
Are you prepared to top 300?
No, I don't think I'm prepared to top 300!
Are you out of your mind?
We had a deal here!
Are you Realtors just a bunch of crooks?
Is that it?
What's going on with you people?
Well, I am sorry you feel that way, but I have an offer on the table of 300.
- [Computer] Thousand.
- Uh, we'll take it.
- Sold.
- Yeah.
You probably won't live to enjoy the cash.
[Realtor] Just one thing, sir.
What is your name?
My name is Preston...
Bingo.
Macintosh.
My name is Macintosh.
Well, congratulations, Mr Macintosh.
- You have a house.
- Yes!
I'm rich!
Yeah!
Whoo, yes!
Yeah!
Money!
Money!
- You did what with my money?
- [Juice] You're not gonna believe this.
He gave all your money to a little old bitty boy.
That was my nest egg.
That's all I had to start a new life.
I worked hard to steal that money, Biderman!
You gave it to some zit-faced little kid?
Now wait a minute.
I seen the kid.
- His skin looked pretty smooth.
- The boy had a check signed by you.
I didn't write a check to anybody except for this genius here.
Now hold on a minute.
I'm not the one who cashed a check for a million dollars.
- That was this man right here.
- Had your signature.
I said I didn't write it!
You gave me the check-book,
I put it in my pocket, I got in my car, I... I...
I can't feel my legs.
Uh, I...
Oh, oh, oh.
Calm down.
I've got a surveillance photo of the boy.
[Stammering] We'll find him in no time.
- Oh, yeah, that's him.
- I can't see a thing.
I recognize him.
I'd know him anywhere.
It's upside-down.
All right.
So where are you gonna find the kid, Mr Family Man?
- Newspapers.
- You want me to advertise, is that it?
No, no, no.
They have listings.
Uh, family activities where, where...
You know, things where kids go.
See?
Fine.
You're gonna help me find him.
- You understand?
Dead or alive.
- Uh-huh.
Let's get out of here.
- Oh, don't think you ain't comin' with us.
- [Gasping]
Somebody's in there with Biderman now.
A couple of guys I've never seen before.
They've just left.
The money laundering is definitely on again.
We've got to notify the Bureau right away.
[Man] Hello, Limousines Unlimited.
- You have the car keys?
- No, you have the car keys.
- Oh, yeah.
You make sure you-know-who stays grounded.
- And he goes to bed early.
- You got it, Pops.
- Don't call me that.
Uh, excuse me.
Sorry, kid.
Nobody famous inside.
Do you want to take your mitts off the car, please?
- I'm waitin' for a client here.
- But I'm your client.
Oh, right, yeah.
And I'm Madonna.
Sorry, kid.
The boss doesn't like me taking baseball cards as payment.
So if you want to ride in this, you need some buckaroos, buckarinis, some moola, some dinero, some money, some frogskins, much similar to the money you've given me...
In fact, identical to the money you've given me right now.
I was just kiddin' about bein' Madonna.
- My name's Henry.
- Hi, Henry.
I'm Preston.
- Preston, good to see ya.
- Preston Waters.
Yes, nice to meet ya.
Hop in.
Go ahead.
I didn't actually mean hop in, but...
So, where to, boss?
- Well, Harry, we're gonna go buy some stuff.
- Yes, sir.
[Tires Screeching]
"Hey, yeah"
"Ow, whoo"
"The best things in life are free"
"But you can keep them for the birds and bees"
- "Now give me money" - "That's what I want"

- Ice cream!
Turn around, Henry.
- Oh, right on.
"I need some money, baby I need some money"
"I just need a few"
- Hey, thanks a lot for the great watch.
- You're welcome.
- Hey, this guy, uh...
What is it?
McIntyre?
- Macintosh.
Uh, Macintosh.
Yeah, yeah.
If you don't mind me askin', where does he get his money?
Well, he doesn't get it, he just has it.
Why does he get a kid like you to go out and buy all this stuff for him?
He...
He never had a real childhood.
So now that he's really, really rich, he can have all the fun that he couldn't have when he was a kid.
- Oh.
Oh, I see.
- You know.
So he didn't have any fun when he was a kid, but now he's old and he's got money.
You're a kid having the fun for him now... that he couldn't have when he was a kid.
- Okay, sure.
- Stop!
Pull over, Henry!
It's Shay!
- Stop!
Hey!
- [Shay Screams] You scared me!
- Sorry.
- Preston, right?
- You've got a good memory.
- Thanks.
- Great, kid.
Very nice.
- Nice wheels.
Oh, this?
Ah, it's my boss, Mr Macintosh.
- Do you want a ride?
- No, thanks.
I'm outta shape.
Not from where I'm sittin' you aren't.
So, uh, I'm thinkin' about comin' into the bank tomorrow...
- and opening my account.
- Wow, you got the $200 already?
- Just about.
- All right.
Well, see you tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Was that him?
Was that Biderman?
- No, some kid who came into the bank today.
- Nice wheels for a kid.
Yeah.
Says it belongs to his boss, a guy named Macintosh.
Macintosh.
When are we gonna see Biderman?
[Man] It looks like a circus.
Hey.
Hey, hey, move it.
I've got work to do too, you know.
Where am I supposed to go?
You see an opening?
Huh?
Hey, what's the holdup here?
- Yeah, same to you, buddy.
- Hey, move it!
What is all this?
What a mess.
This is absolute madness!
Yo, who's in charge here?
[Preston Over Speaker] You with the race car, put it in the backyard.
Uh, the water slide goes back by the pool.
You guys with the TVs, put them in the living room.
Hey, you with the Cadillac, out by the pool.
You in the green jumpsuits, bring that around the back.
- Preston?
- Hi, Dad.
- What's going on here?
- Movin' in.
- Who is moving in?
- Macintosh.
- Who's Macintosh?
- I'll be right with you, Dad.
Come on, boys.
I don't have all day.
Okay, Mr Waters, the security system is all in place.
Excuse me.
This is the remote.
Here are the instructions.
All right?
We appreciate Mr Macintosh's business.
Here you go, pal.
What's with all the security?
Mr Macintosh says you can never be too paranoid, Dad.
- Well, who is Macintosh?
- I work for him.
He's paying me.
Yeah, but who is he?
I never met him.
- You mean you haven't met him?
- No, I haven't met him.
- He's heard about you.
- Really?
Yeah, about work and stuff.
Really good things.
- Well...
His stuff is blocking our driveway.
- Dad.
Boys!
Could you clear a path, please?
Get a move on it!
All set, Dad.

- Hey!
Whoa!
- "I want candy"
- Oh, Henry!
- "I want candy"
- The blood rushed to my head.
- "Hey"
"Hey"
"Hey, hey"
[Woman] Is something wrong?
No.
I was wondering who could spend cash like that these days.
Oh, yeah.
The man's name is Macintosh.
- Macintosh?
- Mm-hmm.
He just moved here.
- Apparently loaded.
- Apparently.
I don't feel good about being here.
People may get the wrong idea.
Really?
You don't feel good?
How do you think I felt when you gave away my million dollars, huh?
Juice.
See anybody that looks like him?
Oh, yeah.
He looks like him.
Uh, she looks like him right there.
Way back over there, uh, there goes his little twin brother.
You give me one picture and expect me to find him out of all these kids?
You must be crazy.
I'm gonna get on the water slide.
I'm startin' to sweat.
Hey, mister, you know where the refreshment stands are?
- [Pops Balloon]
- No.
[Girl Crying]
Boom, boom, boom!
I got you!
Boom, boom, boom, boom!
[Electronic Gunfire]
- [Butch Whimpering]
- He says he knows you, boss.
Oh, well, just throw him out.
[Screaming] Ow!
Ow!
- Banzai!
- "I want candy"
- [Preston Screaming] - "I want candy"
"Hey"
- "Hey"
- Hiya.
I didn't expect to see you here.
- Oh, what you doin' here?
- I came by to see Mr Macintosh.
- Oh, no, he's in a meeting.
- That's okay, I'll wait.
I just really need to see him.
- He's in meetings all day.
- All day?
- Swamped.
- Hey, I missed you at the bank.
I thought you were gonna come by and see me about opening up an account.
- Oh, I had to work.
- Wow.
This is where you work?
- Not too shabby.
- Comfortable.
- I brought an application.
- Do you still want to open up an account with me?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Do you have your deposit?
- I'll go get it.
Okay.
Great.
[Preston Screaming]
- Whoa!
- That's amazing!
Sorry, just printed it.
Two hundred dollars.
Looks like you fell into some money, huh?
- I make a living.
- Yeah, well, I guess Mr Macintosh...
He knows a good man when he sees one.
- Will he be opening up an account with us?
- Uh, maybe.
Yeah?
Great.
You know, I'd love to meet him.
How's tonight?
- Uh, tonight.
What's tonight?
- Tonight's Wednesday.
Wednesday.
Wednesday.
I'm sorry, he's busy.
- Too bad.
- Uh, but I'm not.
Oh, I handle all his financial affairs.
- You do?
- Not all of them, but I can tell you a lot about him, sort of like a pre-meeting.
- And he wouldn't mind?
- Hasn't complained yet.
Okay.
I'll come by around 8:00.
Okay.
Wait, I could send a car for you.
Okay.
Cool.
It's a date then.
Bye-bye.
A date?
A date?
I've never been on a date.
You know what they call me downtown?
The Babe-Meister.
Think about it.
Okay, I'm gonna tell you about the real deal on dating, which I know.
First of all, women love a great body.
They love...
Look at this bod.
- Whoa.
See?
- Yeah, yeah.
Of course, you've got a bod now that's of a Greek god.
Really.
Think about it.
Women like you to have a good bod because they want to feel they're protected.
You might have to fight some guy, you know?
But not with those arms.
You don't want to hit a guy with those arms 'cause those pythons would take a guy's head off.
Seriously.
You're buff, but we're gonna get you chiseled.
Okay?
Oh, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm having a vision here of a date.
- The perfect date for you guys.
- Uh, Steak Heaven!
Ho, ho!
My little friend, you really have the hots for this one, huh?
You know, if you really want to go upscale, that all-you-can-eat salad bar...
women love that.
And take some with you.
You know, line your pockets with plastic bags.
Put the food in there. 'Cause it doesn't say "All you can eat here."
Does it say "here" on the sign?
I don't think so.
So you take something back for later.
A little snackaroo.
Oh, women love that.
You get home and you got a pocketful of hot wings.
There's nothing more that impresses a woman.
Get yourself some flowers.
Get yourself a great body, some nice hair, some good clothes, a car, and learn to say words like "noncommittal."
You are a date and a half, pal.
"There he is Some Tiny Tim"
"There he is Six foot and risin'"
"Ooh, there he is He's a knockout machine"
- "He's number one He's double cool"
- Yeah!
"He's the naked truth in magazines"
- "I believe in him" - "Wonderman"
- "He is a Mr Wonderman" - "Wonderman"
"He is a Mr Wonderman"
"Ah, yes"
- "Wonderman"
- Ew.
- "Wonderman"
- One more!
Yes, yes, yes!
Ah!
[Preston] Hey, I'm gonna get you!
[Henry] You are little sushi man.
Sushi man down.
Big boy throw.
Then they chase around.
Come around other way, fall down.
Splat.
- [Preston Screaming] - " Here comes the Wonderman He'd like to say bye-bye"
- Why are you dressed like a game show host?
- I'm going out tonight.
Just a minute, young man.
You're still grounded.
- But it's for Mr Macintosh.
- I don't care.
Macintosh may have a pile of money, but he doesn't decide... when my son is or isn't grounded.
- But it's for my job.
- Your job is to be grounded.
- [Both] Grounded.
- So much for Plan 442.
What do you know about Plan 442?
Well, it's the investment plan you've been working on, your "prespectus."
Prospectus.
What are you doing going through my work?
Well, I didn't want to say it, but I told Mr Macintosh... about your Plan 442, and he was very, very interested.
Yep, I promised him I'd bring a copy of it tonight and show it to him.
But I didn't want to tell you just in case you got your hopes all up and...
No, no, no, no, no, of course not.
Let me get you a fresh copy of the "prespectus."
- I'll get a copy of it, sweetheart.
- Prospectus.
Yeah.
- Here.
You're welcome.
- Oh, thank you.
Hurry up.
Go.
Go!
You want the car keys?
Nah, that's okay, Dad.
I don't drive yet.
- [Dad] You want me to drive you?
- [Preston] No, it's okay.
You know, I still haven't met Macintosh.
Maybe I should go over and...
- No!
You'll ruin everything.
- Why not?
He has a date tonight and he's very nervous about it.
- I guess I can see him first thing in the morning.
- Oh, I don't know, Dad.
I mean, he might be up pretty late with this woman.
[Chuckles] Lucky dog.
Later, toads.
- [Groaning]
- Thank you.
That's enough.
- Oh!
- Sorry.
I can't believe Mr Macintosh went to all this trouble.
- This place is great.
- Mr Macintosh has been eating here for years.
Oh, yeah?
I thought he just moved here.
There was a Tangerino where I used to live.
Oh.
[Gargling]
Compliments of the chef for Mr Waters... and his lovely guest.
Th-They look like lobsters, only weenie.
Oh.
Mr Macintosh wanted you to have this too.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, wow.
This is beautiful.
Oh.
But I can't accept this from you.
But it's from Mr Macintosh.
- Why?
- Just a little business gift.
I mean, it's deductible, isn't it?
I'm not really sure, but it's way too expensive.
Mr Macintosh has a million dollars.
A million dollars doesn't buy all that much these days.
Do you think he should have asked for more?
What exactly does he do anyway?
Oh, a little of this, a little of that.
- You know.
- No, I'm afraid I don't.
- Oh, well...
- Is he an entrepreneur?
No, he's American.
Very secretive.
He has some questions for you too.
Okay.
Shoot.
- "Are you married?"
- No.
"What's the shortest guy you ever dated?"
Mmm.
I'm not really sure.
- "The youngest?"
- You know, these are pretty personal questions.
Well, Mr Macintosh is very interested in you.
- He is?
- He's, uh, never met anybody like you before.
He's never met me before, period.
Technically no, but he's been thinking a lot about you lately.
- He has?
- Yep.
Whoa!
Preston!
Are you okay?
- [Screaming] - [Gasps]
Do you like hamburgers?
I love hamburgers.
Never saw this kid before in my life.
This is a waste of time.
Come on.
What's so special about this place?
- You'll see.
- Mmm, come on.
Tell me.
- Okay.
- You gonna tell me?
- Come with me.
- All right.
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll see.
- See what?
- Okay, get in the middle.
- Okay, ready?
Five, four, three,
- Here?
Two, one.
[Shay Laughing] Holy smokes!
Okay!
Okay, now, come here, Shay!
- Okay, okay, now!
- Preston, I don't believe this!
Okay, now, let's run around!
- Don't get wet!
- Get us out!
Run!
[Screams]
- Okay, okay, okay!
- Watch out!
- No, we're gonna get soaked!
- No, no, no.
Now come...
Come around here!
Come around here!
Come on!
- Okay, hold onto me.
- [Screaming] Hey, where are you?
[Screaming] Yeah!
Yes!
- Whoo, yeah!
- Preston!
[Clapping, Cheering]
This is a great idea, Biderman.
Where's all the kids, huh?
Carl, it's late at night.
All the little boys and girls are tucked in bed.
What do you expect?
What I expect is when I give someone a million dollars, and I come back a day later,
I find the million dollars.
That's what I expect.
- Carl, I'm not a magician.
- You can make it disappear,
- you just can't get it back, right?
- I'm telling you...
If y'all want a kid so bad, there go one over there.
[Biderman] That's the little boy from the bank!
Shh.
Shh.
- [Preston Screams]
- Go get him!
- Oh, I'll race ya to the limo!
I'll race ya to the limo!
- What?
Okay, I'll race ya!
[Shouting]
[Screaming]
- I got the door for ya!
- Open the door.
It's freezing!
Go, Henry!
Go, Henry, go!
- [Henry] Here we go!
- [Groaning]
He got away again!
I don't believe this!
He got away again!
[Screaming]
[Shay] This was the most fun.
- I haven't done anything like this since I was a little kid.
- Me neither.
Thank you so much.
When can I see you again?
Well, I really have to spend some time with my job right now.
Well, uh, I'm having a party.
On Friday.
Can you come?
It's for Mr Macintosh.
Um, it could be for your business, sort of.
Mr Macintosh will really be there?
Uh-huh.
It's his birthday.
Okay.
Well, great.
It's a date then.
Oh, I'm getting out up here.
It was really fun.
And, uh,
- I had such a good time.
- Me too.
- Good night, Preston.
- Good night, Shay.
- See you later.
- Bye-bye.
- Good night, ma'am.
Bye now.
It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.
[Henry] So you're having a party Friday?
[Preston] Oh, yeah, it's Mr Macintosh's birthday.
Oh, I thought you said it was your birthday Friday.
Well, we're gonna have a joint party for the both of us.
Oh.
Well, it's a good thing it worked out your birthdays are around the same time.
Hey, you wanna move that horse?
Come on.
What is this, Bonanza?
Let's go!
Well, here we are.
Home at last.
- Thanks, Henry.
- My pleasure.
Hey!
Preston Waters!
- Good night.
- You know what you got, pal?
- What?
- S-T-Y-L-E.
- Style.
Good night, Henry.
- Style.
Good night.
Take it easy, man.
Good night.
Macintosh and I are having the biggest birthday party ever.
- Honey, where's Preston?
- He's working for Macintosh.
Oh.
Where's Damien and Ralph?
They're working for Macintosh too.
Oh.
- Have you met Macintosh?
- No, I thought you met him.
- No, I haven't met him.
- Well, I haven't met him either.
[Machine Humming]
Keep 'em comin'.
Mr Macintosh wants me to get plenty of practice.
[Screams] Watch where you're hittin' those!
Quit messin' around.
Macintosh is watching.
Where?
We've still never seen him.
Just get back to work.
He's watching.
- " [Loud Rock] - [Man]... coming out of the garage.
Ruining the neighborhood.
"[Continues]
[Shooting Noises]
[Henry] Hey, Preston!
Your party planner's here again.
[Woman] Piston!
Piston!
Piston!
Turn off this contraption.
I have wonderful news.
Mr Macintosh's birthday is going to be the event of the century.
We gonna make the front page from coast to coast.
Oh, we are so lucky, lucky, lucky!
Now what kind of food does Mr Macintosh like?
- I don't know.
- And who are his friends?
- Do you have a guest list?
- Uh, I don't think so.
You know, dewdrop, I think I should meet him because...
I'm gonna need a little cash deposit.
Oh.
Uh, here.
Let me get you some cash.
Ooh, yes, you do have money, don't you?
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Careful walking around with this much money, darling.
Somebody could just rip you right off.
Now, this first $10,000 is going to be the deposit.
Now, of course, I'll get the balance at the party, and Mr Macintosh is good for it?
I am just so looking forward to meeting him.
- Who isn't?
- Waiters, security,
- guest list, paparazzi...
- Oh, and Yvonne?
- Yes?
- Remember, it's Preston.
Whatever!
Hey, uh, hey, Henry.
[Grunting, Laughing] It's attack of the 50-foot chauffeur from hell!
I was just wondering if you wanted to play some video games.
Oh, man, I wish you'd have said something.
I can't.
I promised some friends I was gonna meet 'em in a while.
Oh, okay.
No problem.
I'll tell you what.
I'll drop you over at one of your friend's place... on the way over, and you can have some fun there.
Nah.
Maybe I'll go to the park.
All right.
It's up to you.
Hey, Preston,
- is my tie straight?
- Well, it looks perfect.
All right.
Later.
- Over here.
- Over here!
There it is.
That's the park up ahead.
Where did all these kids come from?
Keep driving and maybe someday I'll tell you.
- How could you hit a kid?
- I didn't hit a kid.
I ran over his bicycle.
I had a dog once that got hit by a train.
- Thanks for sharing, Juice.
- Old King Cole we called him.
- He was a merry old soul.
- It's him.
- Boy with the backpack.
- Go!
Go!
Go!
- The sign says "No Cars Allowed"!
- Just drive!
Quigley!
- You're gonna pay for this!
- Just drive!
- Carl, this isn't a good idea.
- Shut up!
Whoa!
Let go, man.
What's goin' on?
- Oooh!
- Oooh!
- I'm gonna get him.
- We're gonna tear him up!
- Reach over there and get him!
- Your butt is mine, kid!
I've been wantin' this little punk.
I own you!
I own you, kid!
Come here!
He's got my money!
Aaaah!
- Follow him on foot!
Go!
- Follow him on foot?
- Do I look like a bloodhound, a professional tracker?
- Juicy, listen.
If we don't get that kid, nobody gets paid.
[Groaning]
- I want cash benefits, dental, everything.
- Not a problem.
Insurance!
Here, kiddie, kiddie!
Oh, there you go.
Come here, boy.
I'm gonna get you now.
I've been lookin' for you!
Huh?
Oh, no.
There he goes.
Yes.
Come here, boy!
I'm gonna get you now!
Aaaah!
Don't believe this!
Kill that kid when I find him.
I'm not gettin' paid for this.
- Where are we going now?
My hands are over my eyes.
- Shut up!
- Get out...
- [Screaming]
There he is!
Stick with it!
I got ya!
[Juice] I'll get you!
Hang on, hang on.
- Okay, there he is!
- Come here!
Come here!
- Juice!
Run after him.
- You must be crazy.
You run after him.
- Just ran through this whole entire park.
- Fine, get in the car.
- [Coughing]
- Don't blow chunks in my car.
I just had it detailed.
- I'm cool!
- Are you sure?
Are you sure?
- I'm not gonna mess up your priceless detail.
- Come on.
- [Retching]
- Hey!
[Boy] Wow, what's this?
- Let's go!
- After him!
- Hey, dude!
- [Juice] Move outta the way.
Sorry!
- Get 'im!
- Your butt is mine!
I want this kid...
What are you doing?
- Yeah!
- No!
Carl, watch out!
[Juice] Oh, no!
Whoa!
- Aah!
No!
- Oh, man!
Yes!
Now that's a display of fine driving right there.
You know, Carl, it might be easier just to steal another million dollars.
Hello, Mr Jackson.
Well, well, well, if it isn't the world's youngest personal injury attorney.
You know, you're in a lot of trouble today, little man.
Yeah, 'cause today I have been drinking vodka.
- Take a hike, butt-brain.
- What?
- Take a...
- Never mind, never mind.
Never mind, never mind!
[Chattering]
[Yvonne] Antoine, get that truck thing off the stage.
Thank you!
Get those golden gloves off!
Thank you!
Love, love, love, love!
What do you think?
Ta-da!
Is this to die, or what?
Uh, yeah, sure, it's, uh, to die.
I can't wait to show it to Mr Macintosh.
Come on, honey, let's see what they did with that...
"Is it to die for or what?" [Laughing]
Where did you find her?
Oh, man.
- What does this cost?
- I don't know.
- What do you think it should cost?
- Lots, lots.
Kid, why don't you just tell me what I need to know.
I'm a good guy.
Okay, how good are you going to be to me?
In round numbers.
I don't think you get the picture, sonny.
- Maybe you need a better view.
- [Screaming]
[Screaming] Preston Waters, 1508 Oak Street, Hillsdale, Indiana!
- Thank you.
- [Crying]
- You all right?
- Aaah!
Aaah!
- Is something wrong?
- No, not at all.
- Is Mr Macintosh around?
- Uh, no.
- But he will be here tonight?
- Yeah.
- In person?
- In person.
- Okay.
I'll see you tonight?
- Okay.
Okay.
You're looking good.
Bye.
- I'll be calling.
- What a babe.
Baby brother comes into his own.
For a little weasel, he sure knows how to get a girlfriend.
- Too bad he picked a fortune hunter.
- Little love pilot... shot down in flames by a gold digger.
By a what?
Gold digger, someone who is only after money.
I know women, and that one is after Macintosh's cold, hard cash.
For your information, me and Shay already went on a date... and she had one fantastic time, boys.
Oh, yes, every second she was getting closer...
- and closer to Mr Macintosh.
- [Laughing]
- Shut up!
- Just answer me this.
Did she ever, ever just once, come by without saying,
"Meanwhile, I wonder if I could see Mr Macintosh?"
She's a gold digger, man.
She just wants Macintosh's money.
- Yeah!
Ow!
- Don't rub it.
Be a man.
- Don't rub it.
- I'll rub it if I want to.
- She wants a guy with money, not some little kid with an empty piggy bank.
- Yeah.
"Well, I'll wait by the windows I'll wait by the door"
"To make sure you don't come home"
- You ever known any gold diggers?
- Man, have I.
I hate 'em.
They're the worst.
Anybody who is your friend because you have money is not your friend at all.
You know what they say about gold?
"He who has the gold makes the rules"?
No, no, no.
"A fool and his gold are soon parted."
What does that mean?
"A fool and his gold are soon parted." Those old sayings, man,
I don't get 'em.
I don't even know really what that means.
You ever heard:
"More than one way to skin a cat"?
Who skins cats?
Why would you skin a cat?
And there is not more than one way to skin a cat.
There is only one way.
You grab the cat, you rip the skin off the cat.
What is the number two way?
You put a hose up the cat's butt?
He gets so bloated that he skins himself?
Does he have a piece of Velcro under his butt?
No.
"Kill two birds with one stone." You heard that one?
You know anyone who has even killed one bird with one stone?
Kids try it all the time.
You can't hit a bird with a stone.
Unless you got a huge stone and they're tiny baby birds.
Then... [Imitating Crash] Beep, beep!
Dead.
[Sighing] "A fool and his gold are soon parted."
I guess it means that if you're a fool, your gold or your money is soon gone.
Once it's gone, it is outta there.
It is history.
It is dust.
It is vapor.
It is no more.
You are living in Brokesville.
- Unless you have Macintosh's kind of money.
- What if you don't?
I guess then you find out who your real friends are.
Man, we look good.
- Is everybody having a good time?
- [Woman Laughing]
- Good, you are.
- "Yes, we are, darling." Wow, look at the balloons.
- This is great.
Look at the ice sculpture.
- Presents!
Hey, hey, hey, kid, no touching.
Those are Mr Macintosh's.
Go find your parents.
Go on, get outta here.
Go on!
- I just want to see Mr Macintosh.
- I just want to pig out.
[Chuckling] Hey, look at that.
Excuse me.
- Sorry!
- Exactly who are you looking for, Preston?
- Have you seen Shay?
- I haven't seen her, but she'll be around.
Come on...
Oh, man, look at all this food!
Macintosh doesn't show, we bring the kid in, agreed?
If Preston says Macintosh is gonna be there, Macintosh will be there.
But you don't make a move, until I give you the signal, understood?
We got eight men ready to go in and nail him the second he shows up!
We close this deal tonight!
Where's the pizza and the ice cream?
What's going on here?
This could have been a pizza before it got run over by a couple of trucks.
Oh, that looks tasty.
Looks like something you'd find between your toes.
Ah, ah, ah!
It's sucking the life outta me!
- Shut up!
Everybody's looking.
- So what?
Who cares?
Relax, have a good time.
She'll show up.
Oh, there's Shay now.
Ha!
Just kidding.
I was kidding ya!
Would you just relax?
She'll be here.
It's not at all what you thought it'd be like?
Hate being rich, huh?
Preston?
Preston?
Ice cream, ice cream.
Yoo-hoo, Preston!
Now, where is our mystery man?
It's time for Mr Macintosh to make his appearance.
I like to give my employers their bills directly.
That way if they have any questions or heart attacks or something...
- I'll give it to him.
- Fine.
Be quick about it.
$100,000?
Sweetheart, I know this seems like a whole lot of money to normal people like me and you, but to a man like Macintosh this is just pennies.
- Now, you get up there and get me my money!
- Ow!
I'll get your money.
[Computer Beeping]
Party: $100,000.
Not a problem.
You can leave it.
This is fine.
I'll be right back.
Thank you.
[Computer] Transaction not possible.
Insufficient funds.
Current balance: $332.17.
- Transaction not possible.
- Three hundred dollars?
- Insufficient funds.
Transaction not possible.
- Oh, no!
- No, please, God.
- Insufficient funds.
This can't be right.
One, two, three, four...
[Chattering]
It's gone.
It's all gone.
[Knocking]
Mr Macintosh?
Oh, sorry to bother you.
It's Fred Waters, Preston's dad.
I know you got a bash going on here, so I'll make it brief.
But, uh,
I wanted to ask you a favor.
You see, today is Preston's birthday and if you see him, if you could send him home a little early.
Lately he's been working so hard.
All of a sudden money's become so important to him.
I guess that's mostly my fault.
You don't have kids, do you, Mr Macintosh?
I'll tell you, it's very easy to make mistakes with them.
I haven't always paid enough attention to my kids.
I pushed them too hard... maybe.
Especially Preston.
I guess I expect more from him.
He reminds me of myself at that age.
I couldn't wait to grow up.
I'm afraid he's missing out on his childhood.
So am I.
Well, thanks.
I won't take up any more of your time.
And we appreciate you sending Preston home early.
If...
If he wants to come, that is.
- [Whispering] I want to come home.
- Thanks.
Dad.
Dad?
Dad?
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad, wait!
Daddy!
Henry?
Henry!
Wait a minute, where's Henry?
Your driver?
He left a little while ago.
H-He left?
You sure it was Henry?
Big guy, white limo.
He's gone.
Thanks.
Now I know who my friends are.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
- [Door Opening] - [Shay] Preston?
Mr Macintosh?
- Mr Macintosh?
- It's just me.
- Which one of us did you want?
- I was looking for you.
- Oh, good.
- And Mr Macintosh.
Look, it's very, very important that I find Mr Macintosh right now.
- Do you understand?
- He's nowhere.
- He's gone.
I think you'd better leave too.
- Preston...
- you could be in danger.
- Just go, okay?
You got your necklace.
Just take it and leave.
"Give it back There's no time to lose"
"So give it back Give it back"
Riggs?
Riggs?
Riggs?
Looks like no one's home.
- Shut up, Wienerman.
- Biderman.
- Where is he?
- I don't know, but he might be down the street... at Mr Macintosh's, that's his boss.
- Macintosh.
Come on!
- [Whimpering]
You know, I do like what they have done with this color.
There you are, puppy-butt.
Did you get me my money?
- Uh, Macintosh has disappeared.
- What?
Now, I am warning you, Tom Thumb, don't you trifle with me.
If I don't get paid, I will sue Mr Macintosh... for every dime he is worth!
Well, be sure and tell me when you find him.
Okay, little Mr Man, this party is over!
Quiet!
Stop that playing!
Stop that music!
Quiet!
Attention!
Attention!
Everybody, this party is over!
Our host...
can't pay his bills!
- Mr Macintosh is a fraud!
- [Woman] What?
[Crowd Murmuring] Who's that kid?
She's right.
Hate to tell you this, but there's been a terrible mistake.
Nobody s-should have been invited.
Macintosh is... is gone.
And he's not coming back.
So I think you should all leave too, so go.
Go on.
Close down the bar!
Come on, let's get outta here.
Come on, Antoine.
Move it!
Come on, move it!
Come back with those glasses!
Give me that!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
[Knocking]
Henry?
Henry!
I knew you'd come back!
Henry...
[Gasping]
Happy birthday.
I'm here to blow out your candles.
- Oh!
Let me go!
- What's your hurry, kid?
Got a big check to cash?
- Let me go!
- I like this pad.
What do you think, Juice?
Oh, yeah, I like the pad.
It looks real nice.
- Can you handle it?
Got the TV, drums.
- Oh, I like this.
- TV, drums.
- All kinds of toys.
- He's got a little taste, a little flavor.
- What's this thing here?
- I don't think I've seen one of those before.
- How do you work this?
Well, you turn the knob...
You really shouldn't let him in such a nice house as this.
All your stuff could get broken.
Kid, where's Macintosh?
N-Nowhere.
He's nowhere.
I'm going to ask you one more time.
Where is he?
Huh!
There is no Macintosh.
- I made him up.
It was me the whole time.
- Don't give me that.
- Who bought this house?
- I-I did.
You?
You outbid me?
Wait a minute.
You tryin' to tell me that this little boy here... outbid you with your own money?
Be a fly on the wall, okay, Juice?
Listen, kid, you know it's illegal to take things that don't belong to you.
I know.
I feel awful.
Take me to the police.
- Carl, don't do it.
It's a trick.
- Get outta here.
Son, I don't want to take you to the police.
Just tell me, okay?
Where's my money?
I-I spent it.
- All of it?
- All of it.
How could you spend... a million dollars in six days?
You must not have been shopping lately.
Carl, Carl, wait a minute.
Maybe we're thinking about this Macintosh thing in the wrong way.
- What are you talking about?
- You needed a new house, a new identity.
This kid, he's done it for you.
I mean, Macintosh could run for mayor here.
Yeah, I kind of like the idea of that...
Mayor Quigley.
No, no, Mayor Macintosh.
I like it.
Look, there's only one problem with that.
The...
Aaah!
- Hey!
- Come back here!
- Wait for me!
I'm coming!
- He's upstairs, man!
Break it down!
Break it down!
There he is!
- Where is he?
Where is he?
- He went down there!
- Juice, go after him!
- I ain't goin' down there.
- Go on!
Now!
- You're crazy.
I ain't goin' down there.
- Watch your head.
- What is it, about 230...
Whoa!
- Aaah!
- I'm not goin' in there.
- Oh, no, he didn't.
- Did you see him?
- Oh, no, you did just push me in the pool!
- Get out, we gotta find him!
What?
What happened?
Act like you got a purpose in life.
Go.
[Biderman] I think I'm experiencing chest pains.
[Indistinct Noise]
Carl?
Juice?
Huh?
Oh.
Little boy?
Little boy from the bank?
Ha, ha.
Oh!
[Groaning, Grunting]
Where am I?
Oh-oh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
[Sheep Bleating, Cow Mooing]
[Muttering]
[Rooster Crowing]
- Hey, hey!
- [Cow Mooing]
Got ya!
Uh-huh!
- Hey!
- Got him.
It's time for a little batting practice.
Here we go!
Hey!
What's happening?
Whoa!
Hey!
Just outside.
Let's try a sinker.
A sinker!
Another!
Another!
Let's try a screwball!
- Turn, turn, turn!
- Be cool!
Ow!
Hey!
Ho!
Come on, boy!
Screwball!
Boom!
Whoa!
Oooh!
- That must have hurt!
- My god!
Fastball, fastball!
Just inside!
- Oooh!
Ow!
- What's next, Juice?
How about tennis?
It's over, kid.
Ow!
Ow!
Preston, come out, come out, wherever you are.
None of this would have happened, you know, if you hadn't been a bad boy!
Tell me something, did you think you were going to get away with it?
Spending somebody else's hard-earned money?
Huh!
We need to have a chat.
Preston...
I'm not mad any more.
I know you're sorry.
Come on, buddy.
Pres?
Come on out now!
Banzai!
Quigley, I'll be back in a minute.
Don't leave me here...
Oh, where am I goin'?
- Whoa!
Kid!
- Don't you move.
Juice!
Biderman!
Get your useless butt over here!
[Motor Revving, Tires Screeching]
Whoa!
Oh!
Oh!
Kid!
Kid!
What are you doin'?
Oh!
Oh!
Kid, kid, stop, please, please!
Stop!
Oh!
[Groaning]
Kid, please!
Don't do that!
Ooooh!
[Screaming]
Quigley?
Are you okay?
Aaah!
I got you now!
Come get him!
I got him now.
Come get him, you guys.
All right, hold him.
- Baseballs!
- You're not a very nice boy, you know that?
- Freeze!
- Preston, are you okay?
What's this all about?
What's happening here?
Stanley?
What are you doing here?
- Let go!
- As of this moment, you're fired from my bank!
F.B.I., Biderman.
From this moment, you're fired from your bank.
- What?
- You're with the F.B.I.?
- Yes, Preston, I am.
- Okay, kid, finally, at long last, who's Macintosh?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...
- I'm Macintosh.
- You're Macintosh?
I'm Macintosh!
And I want you all off my property now!
- He's Macintosh.
- You sure?
I tell ya, I'm Macintosh!
Please tell these guys I'm Macintosh.
- Oh, he's Macintosh.
Don't you know Papa Macintosh?
- Mr Macintosh.
And Big Mama Macintosh be hangin' out with the brothers.
Mr Macintosh, you're under arrest for fraud, money laundering and grand theft.
- What are you talking about?
- Bring in Biderman too.
- I'm a banker!
- And take Mr Wise Guy too.
- Who?
Me?
I'm not wise.
- Get your hands off me.
- Man, I flunked recess.
- Take it easy, man.
- Take 'em out.
- I'm not even from here, man.
- I'm a banker.
- I was roaming down the street.
Cat said, Hey, there's a party.
- I own a bank!
Sir, stay behind the line there.
Everyone, just calm down, okay?
Honey, I'm gonna check this out, make sure that Preston's okay.
- You take the boys home.
- [Chattering]
- What's going on?
- Something to do with Macintosh.
The F.B.I. Is all over.
- Uh, have you seen my son, a little boy?
- He's inside with the F.B.I.
- Excuse me, excuse me, please.
Officer...
- Whoa, whoa!
- Nobody gets in there without a badge, sir.
- I'm looking for my son.
Kind of neat.
Can I see your badge?
Shay Stanley, F.B.I.
Cool.
Wait a minute.
So that means our date... was just for your...
just for your job?
Well, it started out like that.
I should have known.
Hey, you know, I wouldn't have traded that night for anything.
So when can I see you again, Shay?
Mmm, why don't you give me a call in, say, about ten years?
- Five.
- Seven.
- Six.
- Okay, it's a date.
Good night, Preston.
[Dad] Preston!
Preston?
Oh, my god, he's in shock.
Oh, oh, I'm fine, Dad.
I'm fine now.
Oh, I'm glad to see you.
- What's going on here?
- It's a long story.
- Well, why don't we go on home, you tell me all about it?
- Okay.
I want to say goodbye to a friend, okay, Dad?
Wow, this is just great.
I can't step out for a couple of seconds.
I miss all the action.
Thanks.
- Are you okay?
- I thought you left, man.
No, I didn't leave.
What did we say the party needed?
Ice cream, right?
I just went to get ice cream.
I don't know if I got the exact recipe, but I think I got it close.
- So?
- Hey, it's pretty close.
Well, I guess Macintosh is no more, huh?
It's too bad, because, uh, I really enjoyed working for him.
- I had a good time too...
- Do me a favor?
Next time you see him, tell him, uh, that I'm really gonna miss him.
I'll miss you too, Henry.
You're gonna do just fine.
See ya.
- Hey, Henry.
- Huh?
- Know what you have?
- What?
- S-T-Y-L-E, style.
- Style.
Hey, Preston, you're not gonna finish this ice cream, I guess, huh?
Well, no sense letting' this go to waste.
So, what happened?
Oh, well, uh, Macintosh wasn't...
He...
He wasn't who he thought he was.
- How do you mean?
- Well, he shouldn't have done what he did.
He shouldn't have fooled everybody.
I think you're right.
It's been a long night.
Better get on up to bed.
Yeah, I think I ought to get some sleep too, Dad.
And tomorrow, I'll tell you all about Mr Macintosh.
Sleep well, Preston.
[Group] Ta-da!
"Happy birthday to you"
"Happy birthday dear Preston"
"Happy birthday to you"
Make a wish.
You know what they say, "Be careful what you wish for."
Oh.
What else do I want?
I mean, I got everything... that I need right here.
On the other hand.
From the dawn of time we came, moving silently among you down through the centuries.
Immortals.
I'm Connor MacLeod of the clan MacLeod, the Highlander.
After the death of my friend Ramirez,
and my beloved wife Heather,
I left my home in the Highlands of Scotland and began to wander the world searching for answers.
Finally, I came to Japan, to the mountains of Niri, and the cave of the sorcerer Nakano.
Great danger lies ahead, Highlander.
From a faraway land comes another.
The most feared and evil among us.
He keeps growing stronger everyday, feeding on the power of other Immortals.
Soon, there will be none left who can stop him.
If he wins, the world will suffer eternal damnation.
Who is he?
His name is Kane.
The mountain of Niri, where is it?
[in Japanese] What for?
[in Japanese] Answer me!
Where is the mountain of Niri?
[in Japanese] Do you seek the power of the sorcerer Nakano?
Maybe the old man still can't hear me.
Burn it down!
- How do I kill him?
- With a heart, soul and steel.
- I've heard that before.
- I know.
Ramirez.
Like him, I've lived many lifetimes.
And like him, my gift to you is my knowledge.
The knowledge does not come easy, Highlander.
Nothing is what it seems, Highlander.
First, you must be aware and respect the power of illusion.
You have already lost.
Fight with your spirit, and the sword will follow.
Well done, Highlander.
The sword wields the spirit of its master.
It can be the gate to either heaven or hell.
Just strike at my head and you will take all my knowledge.
I will not.
Not even for the power of illusion?
Not even.
- Where to now, Kane?
- There.
Oh, yes.
This is the place.
- You have to go, now.
- What?
Trust me.
You must leave.
Nakano...
- You have a long journey ahead of you.
- Why do I have to go?
This is not your time, Highlander.
Remember, they're both mine.
Now, go!
I won't forget you.
Nakano!
So good to see you again.
The pleasure is always mine.
Actually, the pleasure's all mine!
Where is the Highlander, huh?
You age badly, you old goat.
I think this is the Highlander!
There can be only one!
- Always in the way, old man, huh?
- More than you know.
When I tell you to go, just go!
Go after the Highlander.
Now!
So...
Your magic has improved, wizard.
Why don't you give it to me?
I didn't give it you 200 years ago.
I'm not about to now!
Yes, but if I cut off your head, I get your magic anyway.
So, we could do this the easy way, or we could do this the hard way.
My head doesn't come off that easy.
No.
But it does come off, nonetheless.
You betrayed yourself, old man.
There can be only one.
Yes, only one!
But it will not be you!
[in Japanese] Hello, Alex.
Good to see you.
[in Japanese] Hello, Takamura.
How are you?
[in Japanese] Fine, thank you.
The archaeological commission is waiting.
The owner of the corporation is threatening to shut us down, so he can continue his foundations.
They can't stop the excavation now.
Alex-san, the Japanese government has enormous respect for such a famous archaeologist as yourself, but this is a delicate situation.
Well, from what you sent me to authenticate, definitely 16th century.
But check the grid points.
Do you realize this spot is less than a mile from the center of Niri?
What are you suggesting?
The cave of the sorcerer Nakano?
- Alex-san, Nakano is a legend.
- Oh, which reminds me...
So's Babe Ruth.
Based on fact.
Domo Arigato.
Oh, Alex.
The commission.
Highlander's out there somewhere.
And he owes me for all those years.
Find him!
Nothing more!
Just find him.
Where are we?
What's happening?
Nothing really left for you to worry about, my friend.
- There can be only one!
- Kane!
- Dad, is it okay?
- Yeah.
I didn't think there could be lightning without clouds.
Let's go.
How can this be happening?
They were all dead, and the prize was mine.
So who is out there?
And where is he?
If anything happens to me, I want you to look after John.
What are you talking about?
I have to leave, Jack.
Everything is taken care of.
Does the boy know you're not his real father?
Oh, yeah!
He knew he was adopted before he could spell it.
I hope whatever's taking you is worth what you're leaving.
I hope so too.
But I don't have a choice.
I know he's alive.
And I have to find him.
Going back to New York to the place of the gathering is not what I had in mind.
Once again, my life was about to change.
What are they doing?
I thought we got clearance last night.
You won't believe this, Alex-san.
Someone broke into the dig.
Oh, shit.
- So what did they take?
- We don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
I couldn't pass the police line.
They found two bodies.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
So this must be the inner chamber.
But how did they know it was here?
Look at this!
What, 1500s?
Remarkable copy.
- Alex!
- I just want a sample.
- Why?
- I don't think it's a copy.
John?
John.
Hey.
I'm not going to be away long.
- Well, you better call me.
- Hey!
You better call me.
You take care of the place.
You're in charge now.
Come here.
I love you, John.
00:26:48,492 -- 00:26:51,519 Hey, pendejo.
What are you doing here alone?
Yeah, that's a cold thing, my man.
- Pretty late for a walk, hey, motherfucker?
- Little boy lost his way.
Hey, fuckhead!
- I'm talking to you.
- Nice blade.
- Gang beating!
- Malloy!
Get in here.
- Clear the way!
- Come on, move!
Severe trauma.
Internal bleeding, two gunshot wounds, 38 caliber.
- Vital signs?
- Stable.
- Lucky guy.
- Notify the police?
- Of course.
What the fuck are you talking about?
These aren't bullet wounds!
- Impossible!
- Stop wasting my time!
- This guy was shot!
- This stuff you should deal with it.
Doctor!
Malloy!
Restrain him!
- Grab hold of him!
- Let me go!
Get me a sedative!
Let me go!
You don't understand!
Let me go!
- Take him up to ward 7 right away.
- Ward 7?
You got a problem with that?
This guy's a lunatic!
Well...
It's definitely not a fake.
It doesn't make any sense.
Alex-san, how do you explain this?
- Where'd you find it?
- In the chamber.
It's old, maybe 300, 400 years.
But look at the pattern, the weave.
Certainly not Japanese.
- Looks like some sort of tartan.
- Scotland?
That's a long way from Japan.
Especially 400 years ago.
Waterloo, my greatest battle.
If only I'd used my left flank before dawn.
Wellington, you swine!
You are better prepared than me.
- Me, the great emperor Napoleon.
- Keep it down!
Who are you?
Martin.
Remember?
Your favorite soldier.
- Martin?
- Yeah.
- Is it you?
- Yeah.
My God, what are you doing here?
I had to warn you.
You're in great danger.
- I know.
It's not safe here.
- Please help me.
Oh, great one!
My mission is not over yet.
What mission?
Wellington.
Remember?
I have to kill him.
Nephew, make him suffer.
- Hey, how do I get out of here?
- Leave it to me.
Soldiers, I'm proud of you!
Finally the time has come, and the time is now!
Shut up!
Highlander!
I am your shadow!
- Where is Kane?
- Don't worry about Kane.
Worry about me.
You've already lost.
There can be only one.
So what do you got, Vorisek?
We got a body here, and we got a head over there.
Now, I suspect foul play.
Maybe you should've taken over for Carson, you're so funny, huh?
Look, Lieutenant.
We got a guy in a halloween costume gets his head sliced off.
- It's not your usual humdrum assassination now.
- Where's the sword?
How'd you know about that?
I was saving that as a surprise.
I remember things.
You, you forget, but I remember.
Hey, Lieutenant.
You know, we checked for prints already.
Wasted your time.
You won't find nothing.
Somebody broke out of the psycho ward, came down here and did this hell of a mess.
- Russell Nash.
- You see?
He's a genius.
Yeah?
So you know the victim?
I know the killer.
Mr Nash?
Lieutenant John Stenn, NYPD.
- What do you want?
- Eight years ago, you got away with it.
But I'm not Detective Bedsoe.
I'm goning to nail you, Nash.
That's a promise.
Have a good night, Lieutenant.
- Sorry, Charlie.
Twenty bucks in my hand.
- Twenty in mine.
- All right.
- You see?
Yo, yo, the brother, the brother.
My brother!
Come on in, come on in, come on in.
Tell you what, you find the red card, I'll give you $20 right now, man.
Easy as that.
You do my magic.
Boom.
You're on.
- Motherfucker, I never seen that shit before.
- Hey, yo, how'd he do that?
Hey, yo!
Yo, gimme back my money!
My glasses!
Fuck it, man.
You keep the money, all right?
Welcome back, MacLeod.
Get back in the car immediately, please!
My son...
I have with me American archaeologist, Dr. Alex Johnson, who's from the New York Museum of Ancient History.
Dr. Johnson, what can you tell us about the discovery, and why is it so exciting?
Well, the artifacts are clearly exceptional, but only after a much more detailed analysis...
- Sarah!
- ...will we be able to speculate as to the identities...
Do I know you?
- No.
- No?
I thought not.
So, what are you doing here?
Well, I may be mistaken, but I had the feeling that this was the house of Mr. DeFernet.
Well, you're obviously not mistaken.
Connor MacLeod.
I see you've met my rather spirited niece, Sarah.
- She's come here from England.
- It seems I'm in need of taming.
Pleasant challenge...
I would imagine.
I invited him for the weekend to join us at the card table.
- So you're a gambler, Mr. MacLeod?
- On occasion.
So am I. On occasion.
- Any chance of a preview?
- Not at this point, but some of the more unusual objects will be lent to our existing exhibition.
However, is it not possible to be stepping on the site of the legendary lost cave of the great Japanese sorcerer Nakano?
As I've said you before, any speculation at this point would be a little premature.
Well, is it not true, Dr. Johnson, that supported by your own controversial studies, that legends can be used to identify archaeological sites?
It is true that we have seen parallels between missing sites before.
But what about the inscriptions?
Do they offer clues or is this just some sort of cave-robbing graffiti?
It's probably just some ancient taggers.
Taggers!
Well, Ms. Johnson, so no idea what it means?
I know what it means.
Cyrillic alphabet, early Russian.
"Tolkah Adeen".
There can be only one.
- Only one what?
- Alex-san.
- Hmm?
- Another fax from Tommy.
"A little something to read on the flight home.
I thought this might interest you."
Well, that's it for me.
I'm off to New York tonight.
Better document that last crate.
The man wants vinyl when he can have the real thing?
I don't think so.
Come on.
Why don't you come here a little bit and make yourself comfortable?
You nice, big boy.
Come on, you little devil.
Silent type, huh?
It fine by me, baby.
But I'm telling you, no glove no love.
What are you waiting for, honey?
Come on, baby.
So after three days, this better be good.
Well, it wasn't easy, but I finally determined the cause of death.
All right, now that we've had our little joke, what else you got?
Nothing.
Besides having his head cut off, he's in perfect health.
No broken bones, no cavities, no organ deterioration.
Like a newborn baby.
- Find out who he is?
- He's nobody.
No prints, no dental, no nothing.
It's like he never existed.
So what do you really think, Howard?
I think you better not smoke in here, Lieutenant.
What's this guy doing in New York City?
- What's he doing on the planet?
- Thanks, Howard!
MacLeods.
But I checked it.
Same pattern, didn't match up.
Apparently, this alteration in the color denotes a branch of the clan that broke away in, I think, 1536.
Here.
Some incident occurred that year involving a Connor MacLeod, who was driven from his home, accused of wielding powers thought to have been unnatural.
So in defiance, the father altered this insignia to honor the son's lineage, but there's been no record of this branch ever since.
Except for a piece of cloth.
Which could now place one of them in a Japanese cave a few years later.
Yeah, but what would a Scot be doing there?
What if he was one of these Gaelic mystics?
I mean, Nakano's initiates were said to have been great sorcerers, right?
- Yeah.
- None of the legends refer to where they came from.
Interesting theory, but, Alex, no records, no proof.
Once a year, the MacLeods meet at Dunvegan Castle, Isle of Skye.
According to the registrar, this entry was made in 1986, some antique dealer claiming to be a direct descendant of this particular branch.
- So where's this guy from?
- New York.
They faxed me his address.
What?
You're going to harass some poor guy about his ancestors?
- He's going to think you're crazy.
- Perhaps.
Then again, at this point... it may be my only link to Nakano.
- Well, I'm off.
- Good night, Tommy.
- I'll tell security you're working late again.
- Thanks.
- What do you call this place?
- Excuse me?
This place, here.
What do you call it?
- A museum, but we're closed.
- Museum.
Ah, no, please.
I'm your biggest fan.
You see, I saw you on television.
I'm a bit of a historian myself really.
This looks familiar.
Isn't it amazing how the present just can't seem to escape the past?
- Can I help you with something?
- No, no, no.
I'm just...
Just doing a little research.
Look at this cave.
Little small, eh?
And what does your museum call it?
- A model.
- A model.
And you?
A vision of a past reality, I suppose.
Oh, reality.
No, not reality.
Reality is so boring.
I much prefer... illusion or fantasy, a little hocus pocus and maybe a little...
Maybe a little bit of... hanky-panky, huh?
Connor MacLeod.
Don't worry, my prissy, I'll find him.
I'm going to find him.
Burn it down.
I'm outside the Japanese Spiritual Center in Queens.
- Good to have you back, Nash.
- Good to see you, Charlie.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
I wish we could go on like this for a thousand years.
What do you wish?
MacLeod?
That he had better timing.
What do you want, Pierre?
I have bad news.
They need you in Paris.
- Why now?
- The revolution has started.
You must leave the girl.
Come now, my friend.
If not for you, then do it for her.
You're not coming back, are you?
You have to get back to England.
It won't be safe here.
No one is safe now.
Connor, take this.
- Russell Nash?
- Excuse me?
- Sorry.
Are you Russell Nash?
- What if I am?
I'm looking for, I guess, the previous owner of your shop, a Connor MacLeod.
You wouldn't happen to know where I could find him, would you?
Did you follow me?
- Yes, but...
- I haven't seen him in eight years.
Do you know if he's still in the area?
I wish I could help you, Miss Johnson.
How do you know my name?
Well, your discovery in Japan has made you famous.
You're obviously... interested in Japan yourself, Mr. Nash.
Strange food, good cars, tough deals.
Listen, it's getting late.
Good night, Miss Johnson.
Look, Mr. Nash, I don't mean to bother you, but you're my only link to this Connor MacLeod.
Try the phone book.
There's plenty of MacLeods in New York.
Well, thanks, but I'm only looking for one.
So am I.
400 years is a long time to hate.
And you never wrote.
But hate feeds you.
It focuses the mind.
Keeps you warm.
Gives you hope.
Eh, MacLeod?
Don't worry about the girl.
She's not really my type.
A little too... pale.
Then again, this being the 90s, I could make an exception, huh?
After all, I've got so much catching up to do.
This is a Buddhist shrine, Kane, and we can't fight on holy ground.
Oh, well.
I guess I'll be the judge of that.
Nothing!
There can be only... one!
After 400 years, patience is a virtue.
Jesus Christ!
I'm going in!
Listen!
Whatever you saw, you saw nothing.
You don't know what you're getting yourself into.
Stay away!
Freeze!
Police!
One more thing I think you should know about.
There was a woman.
Worked with us once in a while.
Brenda.
Brenda Wyatt.
- What about her?
- Well, she was fascinated by... the murders, the swords, the whole thing.
Lieutenant, it's what, 5:00 in the morning?
Look!
They scraped her off a highway in Scotland seven years ago.
She was killed instantly, but he walked away without a scratch.
Sad for him.
So, are you sure you didn't see anything?
- Miss Johnson!
- Sorry.
No.
Russell Nash is a dangerous man.
Now, I suggest you stay away from him.
That's exactly what he said.
Please, my friend.
For the revolution.
MacLeod!
Visitor!
Calm down, MacLeod.
If you die, we lose a great warrior against evil.
I'm here to take your place.
Go home and sleep it off.
Come on.
I'm tired of this eternal life.
Death would release me from my pain.
- Come on.
Pierre, go home.
- I'm not going anywhere.
It's time, Mr. MacLeod.
When he wakes up, throw him out.
God be with you.
For treason against the King of France,
Connor MacLeod.
Connor!
Connor!
Connor!
Sarah.
Yes?
Well, it was a very interesting evening last night, but I didn't exactly have time to check the phone book,
Mr. MacLeod.
You want to come in?
Come in.
I'll fix you a drink.
Make yourself comfortable.
Thanks.
You've got quite a collection.
- Hello?
- Mr. MacLeod?
This is Janet at Super Travel.
I'm calling to confirm your reservation on the Newark-Glasgow flight.
Your ticket is prepaid and waiting at the counter.
- Thanks.
- Bye.
Bye.
Lot of Connors in the family.
Her name was Sarah.
Ah, Papa.
Look, I don't know what was going on last night, but I think it's got something to do with what I'm working on.
We found a piece of tartan in the cave that was traced to an undocumented branch of the MacLeods, of which you are apparently the only member on record.
That cave was sealed 400 years ago.
Have you ever heard of the legend of the sorcerer Nakano?
Don't you ever think about anything else but business?
Do you have something better to offer?
- It seems I'm in need of taming.
- Pleasant challenge...
I would imagine.
Well, I'm sure you'll let me know if something comes to mind, huh?
What's this?
Looks familiar?
Death to the MacLeods!
My bonny Heather, my first wife, my first love.
I came back here because this is where it all started.
And I need some strength.
The last 400 years have been good to you, MacLeod.
Oops-a-daisy.
Hi.
Leave a message.
I'll call you back.
Hi, it's me, John.
I miss you.
When are you coming home?
You said you were going to call me, remember?
Well, in case you forgot, it's Marrakesh 1442.
Love you, Daddy.
Bye.
Daddy.
Daddy.
Hey, MacLeod.
I thought you'd find me.
Why did you come?
Nakano.

You seem like you belong here.
Maybe I used to.
But that was a long time ago.
You spend a lot of time alone.
I'm used to it.
Nobody is.
You don't let people in, do you?
I can't.
- It hurts to love and--
- And see them die?
Like the woman in the painting.
Yes.
I loved her very much.
I know who you are.
You're Connor MacLeod.
Born into the clan MacLeod, in Glenfinnan, on the shores of Loch Shiel.
You were driven from your home in 1536.
- And I cannot die.
- And have wandered the world ever since.
- Mr. MacLeod?
- Yeah?
There's a Jack Donovan on the phone returning your call.
I'll be right back.
- Jack.
- What the hell are you doing in Scotland?
- What do you mean?
- John's on the flight from Marrakesh.
He gets into Newark tomorrow afternoon as planned.
- What are you saying, Jack?
- Is something wrong with your memory?
I've just dropped him at the airport.
- Is there a problem?
- No problem, Jack.
I'll pick him up.
Bye, Jack.
Thanks.
Passport, please.
- You're traveling alone?
- Yeah, but my dad's picking me up.
- Welcome to the United States, Mr. MacLeod.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
- What?
- They got Nash.
- Where?
All right, we'll be right there.
Northwest Airlines, flight 489.
Just landed in Newark.
Come on, move!
Let's go!
I know he's here somewhere.
I can feel him.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- Did you see that?
Next.
- Dad!
- John.
- Freeze!
- Let me go!
John!
- Where's the Porsche?
- The Porsche?
Get in the car.
Little punk.
Who are you?
I'm a friend of your daddy's.
- He's got my son.
- What son, Nash?
There's nothing in your file about a son.
- You're a liar, Nash!
- You're a fuckin' liar!
Nash, what son?
Please, stop the car!
Please!
Let me out of here!
"Let me out of here.
Please, stop the car."
Stop, please!
Look at the plane!
There's a plane!
I ain't missing' my plane!
You take the wheel!
Watch out!
Give it back Oh, mother!
- Okay, guys, I'll take it from here.
- Okay.
Good luck, Lieutenant.
So, Nash, talk to me.
We've got plenty of time.
- Help, it's a truck!
- There's a truck!
Stop!
Fucking bullshit!
Without a confession, we got nothing on this guy.
So if we can't charge him, he's going to have to release him.
Pretty stuffy, eh?
Need a little ventilation, eh?
Oops.
There goes!
Now, first rule of safety.
Keep your eye on the road!
What's that?
It's a wall!
Okay, Nash, you're free to go, for now.
- Oh, yeah, one more thing.
- What?
One day you'll make a mistake, and when you do, I'll nail you.
- I've heard that before.
- Let the fucker go.
Your daddy can't save you now, eh?
MacLeod or Highlander.
Whatever you're going by these days.
- It's your boy.
- Dad!
I hope I wasn't too hard on him.
I'm at the old mission, Route 1, Jersey City.
Do come.
Dad!
The importance of teaching young people family values.
- Smoke?
- Don't touch him.
- Little punk.
- Come here, John.
Go see your father.
Disappearance in the family.
It's funny, you know.
I thought Immortals couldn't have children.
But it seems that while I'm the master of illusion, you are turning out to be the master of deception, Highlander.
How did you do it?
How did you convince all those lovely women of yours that they were the ones that couldn't bear children?
When all the while it was you and your little immortal pecker that really didn't do the pecking.
Oh, I know.
You must've been very disappointed.
All those nice years thinking you were the only one left.
But, you see, the prize was never yours.
And now, it never will be.
Amen.
Nice little speech, Kane, but it's not gonna save your head.
Where's John?
Well, come with me.
Come.
Where's Johnny?
Here's Johnny.
MacLeod?
- What are you doing here?
- I followed you.
I just thought I could help.
Oh, shit!
Come on.
Ooh, MacLeod.
You're such a lady-killer.
I can't kill an unarmed man.
Take it.
But then again, life isn't fair, is it?
Come here!
I'll see you... in hell.
I'll be the judge of that.
There can be only one.
Dad?
Dad?
John.
Oh, John.
Will you do somethin' for me, Connor?
In the years to come, will you light a candle and remember me on my birthday?
Aye, love.
I will.
There's a fresh breeze blowing off the loch.
The glen is snowy and cold.
It's the most glorious sight on Earth.
I've found no place to match it in 400 years.
I'm back now.
With a woman I love and a son I've taken as my own.
I'm at peace.
It's finally over.
From the dawn of time we came, moving silently among you... down through the centuries... immortals.
I'm Connor MacLeod of the clan MacLeod, the Highlander.
After the death of my friend Ramirez,
And my beloved wife Heather,
I left my home in the highlands of Scotland... and began to wander the world searching for answers.
Finally, I came to Japan... to the mountains of Niri and the cave of the sorcerer Nakano.
Great danger lies ahead, Highlander.
From a faraway land comes another, the most feared and evil among us.
He keeps growing stronger everyday, feeding on the power of other immortals.
Soon, there will be none left who can stop him.
If he wins, the world will suffer eternal damnation.
Who is he?
His name is Kane.
The mountain of Niri, where is it?
What for?
Listen!
Where is the mountain of Niri?
Do you seek the power of the sorcerer Nakano?
Maybe the old man still can't hear me.
- Burn it down!
- Yeah!
- Hyah!
- No!
Oh!
Come on!
Hey!
How do I kill him?
With a heart, soul and steel.
I've heard that before.
I know.
Ramirez.
Like him,
I have lived many lifetimes.
And like him, my gift to you is my knowledge.
The knowledge does not come easy, Highlander.
Nothing is what it seems, Highlander.
First, you must be aware and respect the power of illusion.
You have already lost.
Fight with your spirit... and the sword will follow.
Well done, Highlander.
The sword wields the spirit of its master.
It can be the gate to either heaven or hell.
Just strike at my head and you will take all my knowledge.
I will not.
Not even for the power of illusion?
Not even.
- Where to now, Kane?
- There.
Oh, yes.
This is the place.
- Shh.
You have to go now.
- What?
Shh.
Trust me.
You must leave.
Nakano.
You have a long journey ahead of you.
Why do I have to go?
This is not your time, Highlander.
Remember... they're both mine.
Now, go!
I won't forget you.
Ah, Nakano.
So good to see you again.
The pleasure is always mine!
Actually, the pleasure's all mine!
Where is the Highlander?
Huh?
You age badly, you old goat.
Aah.
I think this is the Highlander.
There can be only one!
Always in the way, old man, huh?
More than you know.
When I tell you to go, just go!
Go after the Highlander!
Now!
So.
Your magic has improved, wizard.
Why don't you give it to me?
I didn't give it you 200 years ago.
- I'm not about to now!
- Yes.
But if I cut off your head, I get your magic anyway.
So... we could do this the easy way... or we could do this...
the hard way.
My head doesn't come off that easy.
No?
But it does come off, nonetheless.
You betrayed yourself, old man.
There can be... only one.
Yes, only one!
But it will not be you!
Hi, Alex.
Good to see you.
Hi, Takamura.
How are you?
Fine, thank you.
The archaeological commission is waiting.
The owner of the corporation is threatening... to shut us down so he can continue his foundations.
They can't stop the excavation now.
Japanese government has enormous respect for such a famous archaeologist as yourself, but this is a delicate situation.
Well, from what you sent me to authenticate, definitely 16th century.
But check the grid points.
Do you realize this spot is less than a mile from the center of Niri?
What are you suggesting?
The cave of the sorcerer Nakano?
Alex-san, Nakano is a legend.
Oh, which reminds me.
- So's Babe Ruth... based on fact.
- Domo Arigato.
Oh, Alex.
The commission.
Highlander's out there somewhere.
And he owes me 400 years.
Find him!
Nothing more!
Just find him.
Where are we?
What's happening?
Nothing really left for you to worry about, my friend.
- There can be only one!
- Kane!
Ahhh.
Dad, is it okay?
Yeah.
I didn't think there could be lightning without clouds.
Let's go.
How can this be happening?
They were all dead and the prize was mine.
So who is out there?
And where is he?
If anything happens to me, I want you to look after John.
What are you talking about?
I have to leave, Jack.
Everything is taken care of.
Does the boy know you're not his real father?
Oh, yeah.
He knew he was adopted before he could spell it.
I hope whatever's taking you is worth what you're leaving.
I hope so too.
But I don't have a choice.
I know he's alive...
and I have to find him.
Going back to New York to the place of the gathering... is not what I had in mind.
Once again, my life was about to change.
What are they doing?
I thought we got clearance last night.
You won't believe this, Alex-san.
Someone broke into the dig.
Oh, shit.
So what did they take?
- We don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
I couldn't pass the police line.
They found two bodies.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
So this must be the inner chamber.
But how did they know it was here?
Look at this!
What, 1500s?
Remarkable copy.
- Alex.
- I just want a sample.
- Why?
- I don't think it's a copy.
John.
John.
Hey.
I'm not gonna be away long.
Well, you better call me.
Hey.
You better call me.
You take care of the place.
You're in charge now.
Come here.
I love you, John.
Get out of the road!
Hey, pendejo.
What are ya doin' here?
Stop the car!
Hey, Antonio.
Hey, vamos, carnales.
Yeah, that's a cold thing, my man.
Pretty late for a walk, hey, motherfucker?
Little boy lost his way.
Hey, fuckhead, I'm talkin' to you.
Nice blade.
Gang beating!
Malloy!
Here!
- Clear the way!
Come on, move!
- Severe trauma.
- Internal bleeding, two gunshot wounds, 38 caliber.
- Vital signs?
- Stable.
- Lucky guy.
- Notify the police?
- Of course.
What the fuck are you talking about?
These aren't bullet wounds.
- Impossible.
- Stop wasting my time!
- This guy was shot!
- You can deal with it.
- Doctor!
Malloy!
- Restrain him!
Grab hold of him!
Get me a sedative!
Let me go!
You don't understand!
Let me go!
Take him up to ward seven right away.
- Ward seven?
- You got a problem with that?
This guy's a lunatic.
Well... it's definitely not a fake.
It doesn't make any sense.
Alex-san, how do you explain this?
- Where'd you find it?
- In the chamber.
It's old, maybe 300, 400 years.
But look at the pattern.
- The weave.
Certainly not Japanese.
- Looks like some sort of tartan.
Scotland?
That's a long way from Japan.
Especially 400 years ago.
Waterloo, my greatest battle.
If only I'd used my left flank before dawn.
Wellington, you swine!
You are better prepared than me.
Me, the great emperor Napoleon.
Keep it down.
Who are you?
Martin.
Remember?
- Your favorite soldier.
- Martin?
- Yes.
- Is it you?
- Yeah.
- My God, what are you doing here?
I had to warn you.
You're in great danger.
I know.
It's not safe here.
Please help me.
Oh, great one.
My mission is not over yet.
What mission?
Wellington.
Remember?
I have to kill him.
Nephew, make him suffer.
- Hey, how do I get out of here?
- Leave it to me.
Soldiers, I'm proud of you!
Finally the time has come and the time is now!
Hip, hip, hooray!
Shut up!
Yeah, man, let's dump this stuff and go.
Highlander!
I am your shadow!
Where is Kane?
Don't worry about Kane.
Worry about me.
You've already lost.
There can be only one.
So what do you got, Vorisek?
We got a body here and we got a head over there.
Now, I suspect foul play.
Maybe you should've taken over for Carson, you're so funny.
Lieutenant, we got a guy in a halloween costume gets his head sliced off.
- It's not your usual humdrum assassination.
- Where's the sword?
- How'd you know about that?
I was saving that as a surprise.
- I remember things.
You, you forget, but I remember.
Hey, Lieutenant, you know, we checked for prints already.
Wasted your time.
You won't find nothin'.
Somebody broke out of the psycho ward, came down and did this hell of a mess.
Russell Nash.
- You see, he's a genius.
- Yeah?
So you know the victim?
I know the killer.
Mr. Nash.
Lieutenant John Stenn, N.Y.P.D.
- What do you want?
- Eight years ago, you got away with it.
But I'm not Detective Bedsoe.
I'm gonna nail you.
That's a promise.
Have a good night, Lieutenant.
Whoop.
Sorry, Charlie.
- Twenty bucks in my hand.
- Twenty in mine.
- All right.
- Yo, yo, the brother.
The brother.
My brother, come on in, come on in.
Tell you what, you find the red card, I'll give you $20 now.
Easy as that.
You do my magic.
Boom.
You're on.
- I never seen that shit before.
- Hey, yo, how'd he do that?
Hey, yo!
Yo, gimme back my money.
My glasses!
Fuck it, man.
You keep the money, all right?
Welcome back, MacLeod.
Get back in the car immediately, please!
My son...
I have with me American archaeologist, Dr. Alex Johnson, who's from the New York Museum of Ancient History.
Dr. Johnson, what can you tell us about the discovery, and why is it so exciting?
Well, the artifacts are clearly exceptional, but only after a much more detailed analysis...
- Sarah.
- Will we be able to speculate as to the identities...
Do I know you?
No.
No.
Hmm?
I thought not.
So, what are you doing here?
Well, I may be mistaken, but I had the feeling... that this was the house of Mr. DeFernet.
Well, you're obviously not mistaken.
Ah, Connor MacLeod.
I see you've met my rather spirited niece, Sarah.
- She's come here from England.
- It seems I'm in need of taming.
Pleasant challenge...
I would imagine.
I invited him for the weekend to join us at the card table.
- So you're a gambler, Mr. MacLeod?
- On occasion.
So am I.
On occasion.
Any chance of a preview?
Not at this point, but some of the more unusual objects... will be lent to our existing exhibition...
However, is it not possible to be stepping on the site... of the legendary lost cave of the great Japanese sorcerer Nakano?
As I've said before, any speculation at this point would be a little premature.
Well, is it not true that supported by your own controversial studies, that legends can be used to identify archaeological sites?
It is true that we have seen parallels between missing sites before.
What about the inscriptions?
Do they offer clues or is this some cave-robbing graffiti?
It's probably just some ancient taggers.
Taggers.
Well, Ms. Johnson, so no idea what it means?
I know what it means.
As for the alphabet...
uh, early Russian.
"There can be only one. "
Only one what?
Alex-san, another fax from Tommy.
"A little something to read on the flight home.
I thought this might interest you. "
Well, that's it for me.
I'm off to New York tonight.
Better document that last crate.
The man wants vinyl when he can have the real thing?
I don't think so.
Come on.
Why don't you come here a little bit and make yourself comfortable?
You nice, big boy.
Come on, you little devil.
Silent type, huh?
It fine by me, baby.
But I'm telling you...
no glove... no love.
What you waiting for, honey?
Come on, baby.
So after three days, this better be good.
Well, it wasn't easy, but I finally determined the cause of death.
All right, now that we've had our little joke, what else you got?
Nothin'.
Besides havin' his head cut off, he's in perfect health.
No broken bones, no cavities, no organ deterioration.
Like a newborn baby.
Find out who he is?
He's nobody.
No prints, no dental, no nothin'.
It's like he never existed.
So what do you really think, Howard?
Mmm.
I think you better not smoke in here, Lieutenant.
What's this guy doin' in New York City?
What's he doin' on the planet?
Thanks, Howard!
MacLeods.
But I checked it.
Same pattern, didn't match up.
Apparently, this alteration in the color... denotes a branch of the clan that broke away in, I think, 1536.
Some incident occurred that year... involving a Connor MacLeod who was driven from his home, accused of wielding powers thought to have been unnatural.
So in defiance, the father altered this insignia to honor the son's lineage, but there's been no record of this branch ever since.
Except for a piece of cloth.
Which could now place one of them in a Japanese cave a few years later.
Yeah, but what would a Scot be doing there?
What if he was one of these Gaelic mystics?
Nakano's initiates were said to have been great sorcerers, right?
- Yeah.
- None of the legends refer to where they came from.
Interesting theory, but, Alex, no records, no proof.
Once a year, the MacLeods meet at Dunvegan Castle, Isle of Skye.
According to the registrar, this entry was made in 1986, some antique dealer claiming to be a direct descendant... of this particular branch.
So where's this guy from?
New York.
They faxed me his address.
What?
You're gonna harass some poor guy about his ancestors?
- He's gonna think you're crazy.
- Perhaps.
Then again, at this point, it may be my only link to Nakano.
Well...
I'm off.
Bye, Tommy.
I'll tell security you're working late.
Thanks.
- What do you call this place?
- Excuse me?
This place, here.
What do you call it?
Uh...
A museum, but we're closed.
Museum.
Ah, no, please.
I'm your biggest fan.
You see, I saw you on television.
I'm a big historian myself really.
Ah, this looks familiar.
Oh, isn't it amazing how the present just can't seem to escape the past?
C
- Can I help you with something?
No, no, no.
I'm just a...
Just doing a little research.
Ooh, look at this cave.
Little small, eh?
And what does your museum call it?
- A model.
- A model.
And you?
Um, um, a vision of a past reality, I suppose.
Oh, reality.
No, not reality.
Reality is so boring.
I much prefer... illusion or fantasy, a little hocus pocus and maybe a little...
Maybe a little bit of... hanky-panky, huh?
Connor MacLeod.
Don't worry, my prissy, I'll find him.
I'm gonna find him.
Burn it down.
I'm outside the Japanese Spiritual Center in Queens.
Hyah!
Ya!
- Good to have you back, Nash.
- Good to see you, Charlie.
Hyah!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Whooo-oh!
Come on.
Come on.
Hyah!
I wish we could go on like this for a thousand years.
What do you wish?
MacLeod?
That he had better timing.
What do you want, Pierre?
I have bad news.
They need you in Paris.
Why now?
The revolution has started.
You must leave the girl.
Come now, my friend.
If not for you, then do it for her.
You're not coming back, are you?
You have to get back to England.
- It won't be safe here.
- No one is safe now.
Connor.
Take this.
Russell Nash?
- Excuse me?
- Sorry.
Are you Russell Nash?
- What if I am?
- I'm looking for the previous owner of your shop, a Connor MacLeod.
You wouldn't happen to know where I could find him, would you?
Did you follow me?
Yes.
I haven't seen him in eight years.
Do...
Do you know if he's still in the area?
I wish I could help you, Miss Johnson.
How do you know my name?
Well, you're, uh... discovery in Japan has made you famous.
You're obviously... interested in Japan yourself, Mr. Nash.
Strange food.
Good cars.
Tough deals.
Listen, it's getting late.
Good night, Miss Johnson.
Look, Mr. Nash, I don't mean to bother you, but you're my only link to this Connor MacLeod.
Try the phone book.
There's plenty of MacLeods in New York.
Well, thanks, but I'm only looking for one.
So am I.
Four hundred years... is a long time to hate.
Ohh.
And you never wrote.
But hate feeds you.
It focuses the mind.
Keeps you warm.
Gives you hope.
Eh, MacLeod?
Don't worry about the girl.
She's not really my type.
A little too... pale.
Then again, this being the 90s, I, I could make an exception, huh?
After all, I've got so much catching up to do.
This is a Buddhist shrine, Kane, and we can't fight on holy ground.
Oh, well...
I guess I'll be the judge of that.
Hyah!
Oooh.
Nothing!
There can be only...
One!
After 400 years, patience is a virtue.
Jesus Christ!
I'm goin' in!
Listen!
Whatever you saw, you saw nothing.
You don't know what you're getting yourself into.
Stay away.
Freeze!
Police!
One more thing I think you should know about:
There was a woman.
Worked with us once in a while.
Brenda.
Brenda Wyatt.
- What about her?
- Well, she was fascinated by... the murders, the swords...
the whole thing.
Lieutenant, it's what, 5:00 in the morning?
They scraped her off a highway in Scotland seven years ago.
She was killed instantly, but he walked away...
without a scratch.
Sad for him.
So, are you sure you didn't see anything?
- Miss Johnson!
- Sorry.
No.
Russell Nash is a dangerous man.
Now I suggest you stay away from him.
That's exactly what he said.
Please, my friend.
For the revolution.
MacLeod!
Visitor!
Calm down, MacLeod.
If you die, we lose a great warrior against evil.
I'm here to take your place.
Go home and sleep it off.
Come on.
I'm tired of this eternal life.
Death would release me from my pain.
Come on, Pierre.
Go home.
I'm not going anywhere.
It's time, Mr. MacLeod.
When he wakes up, throw him out.
God be with you.
For treason against the King of France.
Connor MacLeod.
Connor!
Connor!
Connor!
Oh, Sarah.
Yes?
Well, it was a very interesting evening last night, but I didn't exactly have time to check the phone book...
Mr. MacLeod.
You wanna come in?
Come in.
I'll fix you a drink.
Make yourself comfortable.
Thanks.
You've, uh, got quite a collection.
- Hello?
- Mr. MacLeod?
This is Janet at Super Travel.
I'm calling to confirm your reservation on the Newark-Glasgow flight.
Your ticket is prepaid and waiting at the counter.
- Thanks.
- Bye.
Bye.
Lot of Connors in the family.
Her name was Sarah.
Come on, dear.
Ah, Papa.
Look, I don't know what was going on last night, but I think it's got something to do with what I'm working on.
We found a piece of tartan in the cave that was traced to... an undocumented branch of the MacLeods, of which... you are apparently the only member on record.
That cave was sealed 400 years ago.
Have you ever heard of the legend of the sorcerer Nakano?
Don't you ever think about anything else but business?
Do you have something better to offer?
It seems I'm in need of taming.
Pleasant challenge...
I would imagine.
Well, I'm sure you'll let me know if something comes to mind, huh?
Hm.
What's this?
Looks familiar.
Death to the MacLeods!
My bonny Heather, my first wife, my first love.
I came back here because this is where it all started.
And I need some strength.
God.
Ahh.
The last 400 years... have been good to you, MacLeod.
Oh.
Oops-a-daisy.
Hi.
Leave a message;
I'll call you back.
Uh, hi, it's me, John.
I miss you.
When are you coming home?
Uh, y-you said you were gonna call me, remember?
Well, in case you forgot, it's Marrakesh 1442.
Love you, Daddy.
Bye.
Daddy.
Daddy.
Hey, MacLeod.
I thought you'd find me.
Why did you come?
Nakano.
You seem like you belong here.
Maybe I used to.
But that was a long time ago.
You spend a lot of time alone.
I'm used to it.
Nobody is.
You don't let people in, do you?
I can't.
- It hurts.
Love and...
- And see them die?
Like the woman in the painting.
Yes.
I loved her very much.
I know who you are.
You're Connor MacLeod.
Born into the clan MacLeod, in Glen Finnan, on the shores of Loch Shiel.
You were driven from your home in 1536.
- And I cannot die.
- And have wandered the world ever since.
- Mr. MacLeod?
- Yeah?
There's a Jack Donovan on the phone returning your call.
I'll be right back.
- Jack.
- What are you doing in Scotland?
- What do you mean?
- John's on the flight from Marrakesh.
He gets into Newark tomorrow afternoon as planned.
- What are you saying, Jack?
- Is something wrong with your memory?
I've just dropped him at the airport.
Is there a problem?
No problem, Jack.
I'll pick him up.
Bye, Jack.
Thanks.
Passport, please.
You're traveling alone?
Um, yeah, but my dad's picking me up.
Welcome to the United States, Mr. MacLeod.
Thanks.
- Yeah.
- What?
- They got Nash.
- Where?
All right, we'll be right there.
Northwest Airlines.
Flight 489.
Just landed in Newark.
Come on, move.
Let's go!
It's over there.
The green bag.
Grab it.
I know he's here somewhere.
I can feel him.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- Did you see that?
Next.
- Dad!
- John.
- Freeze!
- Let me go!
John!
- Where's the Porsche?
- The Porsche.
Get in the car.
Little punk.
Who...
Who are you?
I'm a friend of your daddy's.
- He's got my son.
- What son, Nash?
There's nothing in your file about a son.
You're a a fuckin' liar!
Nash, what son?
Please, stop the car!
Please!
Let me outta here!
- "Let me out of here.
Please, stop the car. "
- Stop!
Please!
Look at the plane!
There's a plane!
No!
Whoo!
I ain't missing' my plane!
Whoa!
Whoa!
You take the wheel!
Watch out!
Give it back!
Ohh!
Mother!
Okay, guys, I'll take it from here.
Okay.
Good luck, Lieutenant.
So, Nash, talk to me.
We've got plenty of time.
Whoo!
- Hey!
Aaah!
- It's a truck!
Stop!
Help!
This is fuckin' bullshit.
Without a confession, we got nothin' on this guy.
So if we can't charge him, he's gonna have to release him.
Pretty stuffy, eh?
Need a little ventilation, eh?
There goes!
Now, first rule of safety:
Keep your eye on the road!
What's that?
It's a wall!
Okay, Nash, you're free to go...
for now.
- Oh, yeah.
One more thing.
- What?
One day you'll make a mistake, and when you do, I'll nail ya.
I've heard that before.
Let the fucker go.
Your daddy can't save you now.
MacLeod... or Highlander...
whatever you're going by these days.
- It's your boy.
- Dad!
I hope I wasn't too hard on him.
I'm at the old mission.
Route 1.
Jersey City.
Do come.
Dad!
Ah, the importance of teaching young people family values.
Hah?
Smoke.
- Don't touch him.
- Ha-ha!
Little punk.
- Come here, John.
- Go see your father.
Ohh!
Disappearance in the family.
It's funny.
You know, I...
I thought immortals couldn't have children.
But it seems that while I'm the master of illusion, you are turning out to be the master of deception, Highlander.
How did you do it?
How did you convince all those lovely women of yours... that they were the ones that couldn't bear children?
When all the while it was you and your little immortal pecker... that really didn't do the pecking.
Ohh.
I know.
You must've been very disappointed.
All those nice years thinking you were the only one left.
But, you see, the prize was never yours.
And now, it never will be.
Amen.
Nice little speech, Kane, but it's not gonna save your head.
Where's John?
Oh.
Well, come with me.
Come.
Where's Johnny?
Here's Johnny.
Ahh.
Ooh.
MacLeod.
- What are you doing here?
- I followed you.
I...
I just thought I could help.
Aah!
Aw, shit!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Ooh, MacLeod.
You're such a lady-killer.
I can't kill an unarmed man.
Take it.
But then again, life isn't fair, is it?
I'll see you... in hell.
I'll be the judge of that.
There can be only one.
Dad?
Dad?
Oh, John.
Oh, John.
Will ya do somethin' for me, Connor?
In the years to come, will ya light a candle and remember me on my birthday?
Aye, love.
I will.
There's a fresh breeze blowing off the loch.
The glen is snowy and cold.
It's the most glorious sight on Earth.
I've found no place to match it in 400 years.
I'm back now... with a woman I love and a son I've taken as my own.
I'm at peace.
It's finally over.
From the dawn of time we came, moving silently among you... down through the centuries... immortals.
I'm Connor MacLeod of the clan MacLeod, the Highlander.
After the death of my friend Ramirez...
And my beloved wife Heather,
I left my home in the highlands of Scotland... and began to wander the world searching for answers.
Finally, I came toJapan... to the mountains of Niri and the cave of the sorcerer Nakano.
Great danger lies ahead, Highlander.
From a faraway land comes another, the most feared and evil among us.
He keeps growing stronger everyday, feeding on the power of other immortals.
Soon, there will be none left who can stop him.
If he wins, the world will suffer eternal damnation.
Who is he?
His name is Kane.
The mountain of Niri, where is it?
What for?
Listen!
Where is the mountain of Niri?
Do you seek the power of the sorcerer Nakano?
Maybe the old man still can't hear me.
- Burn it down!
- Yeah!
- Hyah!
- No!
Oh!
How do I kill him?
With heart, soul and steel.
I've heard that before.
I know.
Ramirez.
Like him,
I have lived many lifetimes.
And like him, my gift to you is my knowledge.
The knowledge does not come easy, Highlander.
Nothing is what it seems, Highlander.
First, you must be aware and respect the power of illusion.
You have already lost.
Fight with your spirit... and the sword will follow.
Well done, Highlander.
The sword wields the spirit of its master.
It can be the gate to either heaven or hell.
Just strike at my head and you will take all my knowledge.
I will not.
Not even for the power of illusion?
Not even.
- Where to now, Kane?
- There.
Oh, yes.
This is the place.
- Shh.
You have to go now.
- What?
Shh.
Trust me.
You must leave.
Nakano.
You have a long journey ahead of you.
Why do I have to go?
This is not your time, Highlander.
Remember... they're both mine.
Now, go!
I won't forget you.
Ah, Nakano.
So good to see you again.
The pleasure is always mine!
Actually, the pleasure's all mine!
Where is the Highlander?
Huh?
You age badly, you old goat.
Aah.
I think this is the Highlander.
There can be only one!
Always in the way, old man, huh?
More than you know.
When I tell you to go, just go!
Go after the Highlander!
Now!
So.
Your magic has improved, wizard.
Why don't you give it to me?
I didn't give it you 200 years ago.
- I'm not about to now!
- Yes.
But if I cut off your head, I get your magic anyway.
So... we could do this the easy way... or we could do this...
the hard way.
My head doesn't come off that easy.
No?
But it does come off, nonetheless.
You betrayed yourself, old man.
There can be... only one.
Yes, only one!
But it will not be you!
Hi, Alex.
Good to see you.
Hi, Takamura.
How are you?
Fine, thank you.
The archaeological commission is waiting.
The owner of the corporation is threatening... to shut us down so he can continue his foundations.
They can't stop the excavation now.
TheJapanese government has respect for a famous archaeologist as yourself, but this is a delicate situation.
Well, from what you sent me to authenticate, defýnitely 16th century.
But check the grid points.
Do you realize this spot is less than a mile from the center of Niri?
What are you suggesting?
The cave of the sorcerer Nakano?
Alex-san, Nakano is a legend.
Oh, which reminds me.
- So's Babe Ruth... based on fact.
- Domo Arigato.
Oh, Alex.
The commission.
Highlander's out there somewhere.
And he owes me for all those years.
Find him!
Nothing more!
Just fýnd him.
Where are we?
What's happening?
Nothing really left for you to worry about, my friend.
- There can be only one!
- Kane!
Ahhh.
Dad, is it okay?
Yeah.
I didn't think there could be lightning without clouds.
Let's go.
How can this be happening?
They were all dead and the prize was mine.
So who is out there?
And where is he?
If anything happens to me, I want you to look afterJohn.
What are you talking about?
I have to leave, Jack.
Everything is taken care of.
Does the boy know you're not his real father?
Oh, yeah.
He knew he was adopted before he could spell it.
I hope whatever's taking you is worth what you're leaving.
I hope so too.
But I don't have a choice.
I know he's alive...
and I have to fýnd him.
Going back to New York to the place of the gathering... is not what I had in mind.
Once again, my life was about to change.
What are they doing?
I thought we got clearance last night.
You won't believe this, Alex-san.
Someone broke into the dig.
Oh, shit.
So what did they take?
- We don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
I couldn't pass the police line.
They found two bodies.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
So this must be the inner chamber.
But how did they know it was here?
Look at this!
What, 1500s?
Remarkable copy.
- Alex.
- I just want a sample.
- Why?
- I don't think it's a copy.
John.
John.
Hey.
I'm not gonna be away long.
Well, you better call me.
Hey.
You better call me.
You take care of the place.
You're in charge now.
Come here.
I love you, John.
Get out of the road!
Hey, pendejo.
What are ya doin' here?
Stop the car!
Hey, Antonio.
Hey, vamos, carnales.
Yeah, that's a cold thing, my man.
Pretty late for a walk, hey, motherfucker?
- Little boy lost his way.
- Cat got his tongue.
Meow.
Hey, fuckhead, I'm talkin' to you.
Nice blade.
Gang beating!
Malloy!
Here!
- Clear the way!
Come on, move!
- Severe trauma.
- Internal bleeding, two gunshot wounds.
- Vital signs?
- Stable.
- Lucky guy.
- Notify the police?
- Of course.
What the fuck are you talking about?
These aren't bullet wounds.
- Impossible.
- Stop wasting my time!
- This guy was shot!
- You can deal with it.
- Doctor!
Malloy!
- Restrain him!
Grab hold of him!
Get me a sedative!
Let me go!
You don't understand!
Let me go!
Take him up to ward seven right away.
- Ward seven?
- You got a problem with that?
This guy's a lunatic.
Well... it's defýnitely not a fake.
It doesn't make any sense.
Alex-san, how do you explain this?
- Where'd you fýnd it?
- In the chamber.
It's old, maybe 300, 400 years.
But look at the pattern.
- The weave.
Certainly notJapanese.
- Looks like some sort of tartan.
Scotland?
That's a long way from Japan.
Especially 400 years ago.
Waterloo, my greatest battle.
If only I'd used my left flank before dawn.
Wellington, you swine!
You are better prepared than me.
Me, the great emperor Napoleon.
Keep it down.
Who are you?
Martin.
Remember?
- Your favorite soldier.
- Martin?
- Yes.
- Is it you?
- Yeah.
- My God, what are you doing here?
I had to warn you.
You're in great danger.
I know.
It's not safe here.
Please help me.
Oh, great one.
My mission is not over yet.
What mission?
Wellington.
Remember?
I have to kill him.
Nephew, make him suffer.
- Hey, how do I get out of here?
- Leave it to me.
Soldiers, I'm proud of you!
Finally the time has come and the time is now!
Hip, hip, hooray!
Shut up!
- Yeah.
Let's dump this stuff and go.
- Where you want to go eat?
Highlander!
I am your shadow!
Where is Kane?
Don't worry about Kane.
Worry about me.
You've already lost.
There can be only one.
So what do you got, Vorisek?
We got a body here and we got a head over there.
Now, I suspect foul play.
Maybe you should've taken over for Carson, you're so funny.
Lieutenant, we got a guy in a Halloween costume gets his head sliced off.
- It's not your usual assassination.
- Where's the sword?
- How'd you know about that?
- I remember things.
You, you forget, but I remember.
Hey, Lieutenant, you know, we checked for prints already.
Wasted your time.
You won't fýnd nothin'.
Somebody broke out of the psycho ward, came down and did this hell of a mess.
Russell Nash.
- You see, he's a genius.
- Yeah?
So you know the victim?
I know the killer.
Mr. Nash.
LieutenantJohn Stenn, N.Y.P.D.
- What do you want?
- Eight years ago, you got away with it.
But I'm not Detective Bedsoe.
I'm gonna nail you.
That's a promise.
Have a good night, Lieutenant.
Whoop.
Sorry, Charlie.
- Twenty bucks in my hand.
- Twenty in mine.
- All right.
- Yo, yo, the brother.
The brother.
My brother, come on in, come on in.
Tell you what, you fýnd the red card, I'll give you $20 now.
Easy as that.
You do my magic.
Boom.
You're on.
- I never seen that shit before.
- Hey, yo, how'd he do that?
Hey, yo!
Yo, gimme back my money.
My glasses!
Fuck it, man.
You keep the money, all right?
Welcome back, MacLeod.
Get back in the car immediately, please!
My son...
I have with me American archaeologist, Dr. Alex Johnson, who's from the New York Museum of Ancient History.
Dr. Johnson, what can you tell us about the discovery, and why is it so exciting?
Well, the artifacts are clearly exceptional, but only after a much more detailed analysis...
- Sarah.
- Can we speculate the identities...
Do I know you?
No.
No.
Hmm?
I thought not.
So, what are you doing here?
Well, I may be mistaken, but I had the feeling... that this was the house of Mr. DeFernet.
Well, you're obviously not mistaken.
Ah, Connor MacLeod.
I see you've met my rather spirited niece, Sarah.
- She's come here from England.
- It seems I'm in need of taming.
Pleasant challenge...
I would imagine.
I invited him for the weekend to join us at the card table.
- So you're a gambler, Mr. MacLeod?
- On occasion.
So am I.
On occasion.
Any chance of a preview?
Not at this point, but some of the more unusual objects... will be lent to our existing exhibition...
However, is it not possible to be stepping on the site... of the legendary lost cave of the greatJapanese sorcerer Nakano?
As I've said before, any speculation at this point would be a little premature.
Well, is it not true that supported by your own controversial studies, that legends can be used to identify archaeological sites?
It is true that we have seen parallels between missing sites before.
What about the inscriptions?
Do they offer clues or is this some cave-robbing graffýti?
It's probably just some ancient taggers.
Taggers.
Well, Ms. Johnson, so no idea what it means?
I know what it means.
As for the alphabet...
uh, early Russian.
"There can be only one. "
Only one what?
Alex-san, another fax from Tommy.
"A little something to read on the flight home.
I thought this might interest you. "
Well, that's it for me.
I'm off to New York tonight.
Better document that last crate.
The man wants vinyl when he can have the real thing?
I don't think so.
Come on.
Why don't you come here a little bit and make yourself comfortable?
You nice, big boy.
Come on, you little devil.
Silent type, huh?
It fýne by me, baby.
But I'm telling you...
no glove... no love.
What you waiting for, honey?
Come on, baby.
So after three days, this better be good.
Well, it wasn't easy, but I fýnally determined the cause of death.
All right, now that we've had our little joke, what else you got?
Nothin'.
Besides havin' his head cut off, he's in perfect health.
No broken bones, no cavities, no organ deterioration.
Like a newborn baby.
Find out who he is?
He's nobody.
No prints, no dental, no nothin'.
It's like he never existed.
So what do you really think, Howard?
Mmm.
I think you better not smoke in here, Lieutenant.
What's this guy doin' in New York City?
What's he doin' on the planet?
Thanks, Howard!
MacLeods.
I checked it.
Same pattern, didn't match up.
Apparently, this alteration in the color... denotes a branch of the clan that broke away in, I think, 1536.
Some incident occurred that year... involving a Connor MacLeod who was driven from his home, accused of wielding powers thought to have been unnatural.
So in defýance, the father altered this insignia to honor the son's lineage, but there's been no record of this branch ever since.
Except for a piece of cloth.
Which could now place one of them in a Japanese cave a few years later.
Yeah, but what would a Scot be doing there?
What if he was one of these Gaelic mystics?
Nakano's initiates were said to have been great sorcerers, right?
- Yeah.
- None of the legends refer to where they came from.
Interesting theory, but, Alex, no records, no proof.
Once a year, the MacLeods meet at Dunvegan Castle, Isle of Skye.
According to the registrar, this entry was made in 1986, some antique dealer claiming to be a direct descendant... of this particular branch.
So where's this guy from?
New York.
They faxed me his address.
What?
You're gonna harass some poor guy about his ancestors?
- He's gonna think you're crazy.
- Perhaps.
Then again, at this point, it may be my only link to Nakano.
Well...
I'm off.
Bye, Tommy.
I'll tell security you're working late.
Thanks.
- What do you call this place?
- Excuse me?
This place, here.
What do you call it?
Uh...
A museum, but we're closed.
Museum.
Ah, no, please.
I'm your biggest fan.
You see, I saw you on television.
I'm a big historian myself really.
Ah, this looks familiar.
Oh, isn't it amazing how the present just can't seem to escape the past?
C
- Can I help you with something?
No, no, no.
I'm just a...
Just doing a little research.
Ooh, look at this cave.
Little small, eh?
And what does your museum call it?
- A model.
- A model.
And you?
Um, um, a vision of a past reality, I suppose.
Oh, reality.
No, not reality.
Reality is so boring.
I much prefer... illusion or fantasy, a little hocus pocus and maybe a little...
Maybe a little bit of... hanky-panky, huh?
Connor MacLeod.
Don't worry, my prissy, I'll fýnd him.
I'm gonna fýnd him.
Burn it down.
I'm outside thejapanese Spiritual Center in Queens.
Hyah!
Ya!
- Good to have you back, Nash.
- Good to see you, Charlie.
Hyah!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Whooo-oh!
Come on.
Come on.
Hyah!
I wish we could go on like this for a thousand years.
What do you wish?
MacLeod?
That he had better timing.
What do you want, Pierre?
I have bad news.
They need you in Paris.
Why now?
The revolution has started.
You must leave the girl.
Come now, my friend.
If not for you, then do it for her.
You're not coming back, are you?
You have to get back to England.
- It won't be safe here.
- No one is safe now.
Connor.
Take this.
Russell Nash?
- Excuse me?
- Sorry.
Are you Russell Nash?
- What if I am?
- I'm looking for the previous owner of your shop, a Connor MacLeod.
You wouldn't happen to know where I could fýnd him, would you?
Did you follow me?
Yes.
I haven't seen him in eight years.
Do...
Do you know if he's still in the area?
I wish I could help you, Miss Johnson.
How do you know my name?
Well, your, uh, discovery in Japan has made you famous.
You're obviously... interested in Japan yourself, Mr. Nash.
Strange food.
Good cars.
Tough deals.
Listen, it's getting late.
Good night, Miss Johnson.
Look, Mr. Nash, I don't mean to bother you, but you're my only link to this Connor MacLeod.
Try the phone book.
There's plenty of MacLeods in New York.
Well, thanks, but I'm only looking for one.
So am I.
Four hundred years... is a long time to hate.
Ohh.
And you never wrote.
But hate feeds you.
It focuses the mind.
Keeps you warm.
Gives you hope.
Eh, MacLeod?
Don't worry about the girl.
She's not really my type.
A little too... pale.
Then again, this being the 90s, I could make an exception, huh?
After all, I've got so much catching up to do.
This is a Buddhist shrine, Kane, and we can't fýght on holy ground.
Oh, well...
I guess I'll be the judge of that.
Hyah!
Oooh.
Nothing!
There can be only...
One!
After 400 years, patience is a virtue.
Jesus Christ.
I'm goin' in!
Listen!
Whatever you saw, you saw nothing.
You don't know what you're getting yourself into.
Stay away.
Freeze!
Police!
One more thing I think you should know about...
There was a woman.
Worked with us once in a while.
Brenda.
Brenda Wyatt.
- What about her?
- Well, she was fascinated by it.
The murders, the swords...
the whole thing.
Lieutenant, it's what, 5:00 in the morning?
They scraped her off a highway in Scotland seven years ago.
She was killed instantly, but he walked away without a scratch.
Sad for him.
So, are you sure you didn't see anything?
- Miss Johnson!
- Sorry.
No.
Russell Nash is a dangerous man.
Now I suggest you stay away from him.
That's exactly what he said.
Please, my friend.
For the revolution.
MacLeod!
Visitor!
Calm down, MacLeod.
If you die, we lose a great warrior against evil.
I'm here to take your place.
Go home and sleep it off.
Come on.
I'm tired of this eternal life.
Death would release me from my pain.
Come on, Pierre.
Go home.
I'm not going anywhere.
It's time, Mr. MacLeod.
When he wakes up, throw him out.
God be with you.
For treason against the King of France.
Connor MacLeod.
Connor!
Connor!
Connor!
Oh, Sarah.
Yes?
Well, it was a very interesting evening last night, but I didn't exactly have time to check the phone book...
Mr. MacLeod.
You wanna come in?
Come in.
I'll fýx you a drink.
Make yourself comfortable.
Thanks.
You've, uh, got quite a collection.
- Hello?
- Mr. MacLeod?
This is Janet at Super Travel.
I'm calling to confýrm your reservation on the Newark-Glasgow flight.
Your ticket is prepaid and waiting at the counter.
- Thanks.
- Bye.

Lot of Connors in the family.

Ah, Papa.
Look, I don't know what was going on last night, but I think it's got something to do with what I'm working on.

What's this?
Looks familiar.
Death to the MacLeods!
My bonny Heather, my fýrst wife, my fýrst love.
I came back here because this is where it all started.
And I need some strength.
God.
Ahh.
The last 400 years... have been good to you, MacLeod.
Oh.
Oops-a-daisy.
Hi.
Leave a message;
I'll call you back.
Uh, hi, it's me, John.
I miss you.
When are you coming home?
Uh, y-you said you were gonna call me, remember?
Well, in case you forgot, it's Marrakesh 1442.
Love you, Daddy.
Bye.
Daddy.
Daddy.
Hey, MacLeod.
I thought you'd fýnd me.
Why did you come?
Nakano.
O bonny Portmore
I am sorry to see
Such a woeful destruction
Of your ornament tree
For it stood on your shore
For many's the long day
Till the long boats from Antrim
Came to float it away
O bonny Portmore
You shine where you stand
And the more I think on you
The more I think long
If I had you now
As I had once before
All the Lords in Old England
Would not purchase Portmore
All the birds in the forest
They bitterly weep
Saying, Where shall we shelter
Where shall we sleep
For the Oak and the Ash
They are all cutten down
And the walls of bonny Portmore
Are all down to the ground
You seem like you belong here.
Maybe I used to.
But that was a long time ago.
You spend a lot of time alone.
I'm used to it.
Nobody is.
You don't let people in, do you?
I can't.
- It hurts.
Love and...
- And see them die?
Like the woman in the painting.
Yes.
I loved her very much.
I know who you are.
You're Connor MacLeod.
Born into the clan MacLeod, in Glen Finnan, on the shores of Loch Shiel.
You were driven from your home in 1536.
- And I cannot die.
- And have wandered the world ever since.
- Mr. MacLeod?
- Yeah?
There's a Jack Donovan on the phone returning your call.
I'll be right back.
- Jack.
- What are you doing in Scotland?
- What do you mean?
- John's on the flight from Marrakesh.
He gets into Newark tomorrow afternoon as planned.
- What are you saying, Jack?
- Is something wrong with your memory?
I've just dropped him at the airport.
Is there a problem?
No problem, Jack.
I'll pick him up.
Bye, Jack.
Thanks.
Passport, please.
You're traveling alone?
Um, yeah, but my dad's picking me up.
Welcome to the United States, Mr. MacLeod.
Thanks.
- Yeah.
- What?
- They got Nash.
- Where?
All right, we'll be right there.
Northwest Airlines.
Flight 489.
Just landed in Newark.
Come on, move.
Let's go!
It's over there.
The green bag.
Grab it.
I know he's here somewhere.
I can feel him.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- Did you see that?
Next.
- Dad!
- John.
- Freeze!
- Let me go!
John!
- Where's the Porsche?
- The Porsche.
Get in the car.
Little punk.
Who...
Who are you?
I'm a friend of your daddy's.
- He's got my son.
- What son, Nash?
There's nothing in your fýle about a son.
You're a fuckin' liar!
Nash, what son?
Please, stop the car!
Please!
Let me outta here!
- "Let me out of here.
Stop the car. "
- Stop!
Please!
Look at the plane!
There's a plane!
No!
Whoo!
I ain't missing' my plane!
Whoa!
Whoa!
You take the wheel!
Watch out!
Give it back!
Ohh!
Mother!
Okay, guys, I'll take it from here.
Okay.
Good luck, Lieutenant.
So, Nash, talk to me.
We've got plenty of time.
Whoo!
- Hey!
Aaah!
- It's a truck!
Stop!
Help!
This is fuckin' bullshit.
Without a confession, we got nothin' on this guy.
So if we can't charge him, he's gonna have to release him.
Pretty stuffy, eh?
Need a little ventilation, eh?
There goes!
Now, fýrst rule of safety:
Keep your eye on the road!
What's that?
It's a wall!
Okay, Nash, you're free to go... for now.
- Oh, yeah.
One more thing.
- What?
One day you'll make a mistake, and when you do, I'll nail ya.
I've heard that before.
Let the fucker go.
Your daddy can't save you now.
MacLeod... or Highlander...
whatever you're going by these days.
- It's your boy.
- Dad!
I hope I wasn't too hard on him.
I'm at the old mission.
Route 1.Jersey City.
Do come.
Dad!
Ah, the importance of teaching young people family values.
Hah?
Smoke.
- Don't touch him.
- Ha-ha!
Little punk.
- Come here, John.
- Go see your father.
Ohh!
Disappearance in the family.
It's funny.
You know, I...
I thought immortals couldn't have children.
But it seems that while I'm the master of illusion, you are turning out to be the master of deception, Highlander.
How did you do it?
How did you convince all those lovely women of yours... that they were the ones that couldn't bear children?
When all the while it was you and your little immortal pecker... that really didn't do the pecking.
Ohh.
I know.
You must've been very disappointed.
All those nice years thinking you were the only one left.
But, you see, the prize was never yours.
And now, it never will be.
Amen.
Nice little speech, Kane, but it's not gonna save your head.
Where's John?
Oh.
Well, come with me.
Come.
Where's Johnny?
Here's Johnny.
Ahh.
Ooh.
MacLeod.
- What are you doing here?
- I followed you.
L...
I just thought I could help.
Aah!
Aw, shit!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Ooh, MacLeod.
You're such a lady-killer.
I can't kill an unarmed man.
Take it.
But then again, life isn't fair, is it?
I'll see you... in hell.
I'll be the judge of that.
There can be only one.
Dad?
Dad?
Oh, John.
Oh, John.
Will ya do somethin'for me, Connor?
In the years to come, will ya light a candle and remember me on my birthday?
Aye, love.
I will.
There's a fresh breeze blowing off the loch.
The glen is snowy and cold.
It's the most glorious sight on Earth.
I've found no place to match it in 400 years.
I'm back now... with a woman I love and a son I've taken as my own.
I'm at peace.
It's fýnally over.
O bonny Portmore
I am sorry to see
Such a woeful destruction
Of your ornament tree
For it stood on your shore
For many's the long day
Till the long boats from Antrim
Came to float it away
O bonny Portmore
You shine where you stand
And the more I think on you
The more I think long
If I had you now
As I had once before
All the Lords in Old England
Would not purchase Portmore
All the birds in the forest
They bitterly weep
Saying, Where shall we shelter
Where shall we sleep
For the Oak and the Ash
They are all cutten down
And the walls of bonny Portmore
Are all down to the ground
O bonny Portmore
You shine where you stand
And the more I think on you
The more I think long
If I had you now
As I had once before
All the Lords of Old England
Would not purchase Portmore
From the dawn of time we came,
Moving silently among you...
Down through the centuries...
Immortals.
I'm Connor MacLeod of the clan MacLeod, the Highlander.
After the death of my friend Ramirez,
And my beloved wife Heather,
I left my home in the highlands of Scotland...
And began to wander the world searching for answers.
Finally, I came to Japan...
To the mountains of Niri and the cave of the sorcerer Nakano.
Great danger lies ahead, Highlander.
From a faraway land comes another,
The most feared and evil among us.
He keeps growing stronger everyday,
Feeding on the power of other immortals.
Soon, there will be none left who can stop him.
If he wins,
The world will suffer eternal damnation.
Who is he?
His name is Kane.
The mountain of Niri, where is it?
What for?
Listen!
Where is the mountain of Niri?
Do you seek the power of the sorcerer Nakano?
Maybe the old man still can't hear me.
- Burn it down!
- Yeah!
- Hyah!
- No!
Oh!
Come on!
Hey!
How do I kill him?
With a heart, soul and steel.
I've heard that before.
I know.
Ramirez.
Like him,
I have lived many lifetimes.
And like him,
My gift to you is my knowledge.
The knowledge does not come easy, Highlander.
Nothing is what it seems, Highlander.
First, you must be aware and respect the power of illusion.
You have already lost.
Fight with your spirit...
And the sword will follow.
Well done, Highlander.
The sword wields the spirit of its master.
It can be the gate to either heaven or hell.
Just strike at my head and you will take all my knowledge.
I will not.
Not even for the power of illusion?
Not even.
- Where to now, Kane?
- There.
Oh, yes.
This is the place.
- Shh.
You have to go now.
- What?
Shh.
Trust me.
You must leave.
Nakano.
You have a long journey ahead of you.
Why do I have to go?
This is not your time, Highlander.
Remember...
They're both mine.
Now, go!
I won't forget you.
Ah, Nakano.
So good to see you again.
The pleasure is always mine!
Actually, the pleasure's all mine!
Where is the Highlander?
Huh?
You age badly, you old goat.
Aah.
I think this is the Highlander.
There can be only one!
Always in the way, old man, huh?
More than you know.
When I tell you to go, just go!
Go after the Highlander!
Now!
So.
Your magic has improved, wizard.
Why don't you give it to me?
I didn't give it you 200 years ago.
- I'm not about to now!
- Yes.
But if I cut off your head, I get your magic anyway.
So... we could do this the easy way...
Or we could do this...
the hard way.
My head doesn't come off that easy.
No?
But it does come off, nonetheless.
You betrayed yourself, old man.
There can be...
Only one.
Yes, only one!
But it will not be you!
Hi, Alex.
Good to see you.
Hi, Takamura.
How are you?
Fine, thank you.
The archaeological commission is waiting.
The owner of the corporation is threatening...
To shut us down so he can continue his foundations.
They can't stop the excavation now.
Japanese government has enormous respect for such a famous archaeologist as yourself,
But this is a delicate situation.
Well, from what you sent me to authenticate, definitely 16th century.
But check the grid points.
Do you realize this spot is less than a mile from the center of Niri?
What are you suggesting?
The cave of the sorcerer Nakano?
Alex-San, Nakano is a legend.
Oh, which reminds me.
- So's Babe Ruth... based on fact.
- Domo Arigato.
Oh, Alex.
The commission.
Highlander's out there somewhere.
And he owes me 400 years.
Find him!
Nothing more!
Just find him.
Where are we?
What's happening?
Nothing really left for you to worry about, my friend.
- There can be only one!
- Kane!
Ahhh.
Dad, is it okay?
Yeah.
I didn't think there could be lightning without clouds.
Let's go.
How can this be happening?
They were all dead and the prize was mine.
So who is out there?
And where is he?
If anything happens to me, I want you to look after John.
What are you talking about?
I have to leave, Jack.
Everything is taken care of.
Does the boy know you're not his real father?
Oh, yeah.
He knew he was adopted before he could spell it.
I hope whatever's taking you is worth what you're leaving.
I hope so too.
But I don't have a choice.
I know he's alive...
and I have to find him.
Going back to New York to the place of the gathering...
Is not what I had in mind.
Once again, my life was about to change.
What are they doing?
I thought we got clearance last night.
You won't believe this, Alex-San.
Someone broke into the dig.
Oh, shit.
So what did they take?
- We don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
I couldn't pass the police line.
They found two bodies.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
So this must be the inner chamber.
But how did they know it was here?
Look at this!
What, 1500s?
Remarkable copy.
- Alex.
- I just want a sample.
- Why?
- I don't think it's a copy.
John.
John.
Hey.
I'm not gonna be away long.
Well, you better call me.
Hey.
You better call me.
You take care of the place.
You're in charge now.
Come here.
I love you, John.
Get out of the road!
Hey, pendejo.
What are ya doin' here?
Stop the car!
Hey, Antonio.
Hey, vamos, carnales.
Yeah, that's a cold thing, my man.
Pretty late for a walk, hey, motherfucker?
Little boy lost his way.
Hey, fuckhead, I'm talkin' to you.
Nice blade.
Gang beating!
Malloy!
Here!
- Clear the way!
Come on, move!
- Severe trauma.
- Internal bleeding, two gunshot wounds, 38 caliber.
- Vital signs?
- Stable.
- Lucky guy.
- Notify the police?
- Of course.
What the fuck are you talking about?
These aren't bullet wounds.
- Impossible.
- Stop wasting my time!
- This guy was shot!
- You can deal with it.
- Doctor!
Malloy!
- Restrain him!
Grab hold of him!
Get me a sedative!
Let me go!
You don't understand!
Let me go!
Take him up to ward seven right away.
- Ward seven?
- You got a problem with that?
This guy's a lunatic.
Well...
It's definitely not a fake.
It doesn't make any sense.
Alex-San, how do you explain this?
- Where'd you find it?
- In the chamber.
It's old, maybe 300, 400 years.
But look at the pattern.
- The weave.
Certainly not Japanese.
- Looks like some sort of tartan.
Scotland?
That's a long way from Japan.
Especially 400 years ago.
Waterloo, my greatest battle.
If only I'd used my left flank before dawn.
Wellington, you swine!
You are better prepared than me.
Me, the great emperor Napoleon.
Keep it down.
Who are you?
Martin.
Remember?
- Your favorite soldier.
- Martin?
- Yes.
- Is it you?
- Yeah.
- My God, what are you doing here?
I had to warn you.
You're in great danger.
I know.
It's not safe here.
Please help me.
Oh, great one.
My mission is not over yet.
What mission?
Wellington.
Remember?
I have to kill him.
Nephew, make him suffer.
- Hey, how do I get out of here?
- Leave it to me.
Soldiers, I'm proud of you!
Finally the time has come and the time is now!
Hip, hip, hooray!
Shut up!
Yeah, man, let's dump this stuff and go.
Highlander!
I am your shadow!
Where is Kane?
Don't worry about Kane.
Worry about me.
You've already lost.
There can be only one.
So what do you got, Vorisek?
We got a body here and we got a head over there.
Now, I suspect foul play.
Maybe you should've taken over for Carson, you're so funny.
Lieutenant, we got a guy in a halloween costume gets his head sliced off.
- It's not your usual humdrum assassination.
- Where's the sword?
- How'd you know about that?
I was saving that as a surprise.
- I remember things.
You, you forget, but I remember.
Hey, Lieutenant, you know, we checked for prints already.
Wasted your time.
You won't find nothin'.
Somebody broke out of the psycho ward, came down and did this hell of a mess.
Russell Nash.
- You see, he's a genius.
- Yeah?
So you know the victim?
I know the killer.
Mr. Nash.
Lieutenant John Stenn, N.Y.P.D.
- What do you want?
- Eight years ago, you got away with it.
But I'm not Detective Bedsoe.
I'm gonna nail you.
That's a promise.
Have a good night, Lieutenant.
Whoop.
Sorry, Charlie.
- Twenty bucks in my hand.
- Twenty in mine.
- All right.
- Yo, yo, the brother.
The brother.
My brother, come on in, come on in.
Tell you what, you find the red card, I'll give you $20 now.
Easy as that.
You do my magic.
Boom.
You're on.
- I never seen that shit before.
- Hey, yo, how'd he do that?
Hey, yo!
Yo, gimme back my money.
My glasses!
Fuck it, man.
You keep the money, all right?
Welcome back, MacLeod.
Get back in the car immediately, please!
My son...
I have with me American archaeologist, Dr. Alex Johnson,
Who's from the New York Museum of Ancient History.
Dr. Johnson, what can you tell us about the discovery,
And why is it so exciting?
Well, the artifacts are clearly exceptional,
But only after a much more detailed analysis...
- Sarah.
- Will we be able to speculate as to the identities...
Do I know you?
No.
No.
Hmm?
I thought not.
So, what are you doing here?
Well, I may be mistaken, but I had the feeling...
That this was the house of Mr. DeFernet.
Well, you're obviously not mistaken.
Ah, Connor MacLeod.
I see you've met my rather spirited niece, Sarah.
- She's come here from England.
- It seems I'm in need of taming.
Pleasant challenge...
I would imagine.
I invited him for the weekend to join us at the card table.
- So you're a gambler, Mr. MacLeod?
- On occasion.
So am I.
On occasion.
Any chance of a preview?
Not at this point, but some of the more unusual objects...
Will be lent to our existing exhibition...
However, is it not possible to be stepping on the site...
Of the legendary lost cave of the great Japanese sorcerer Nakano?
As I've said before, any speculation at this point would be a little premature.
Well, is it not true that supported by your own controversial studies,
That legends can be used to identify archaeological sites?
It is true that we have seen parallels between missing sites before.
What about the inscriptions?
Do they offer clues or is this some cave-Robbing graffiti?
It's probably just some ancient taggers.
Taggers.
Well, Ms. Johnson, so no idea what it means?
I know what it means.
As for the alphabet...
uh, early Russian.
"There can be only one. "
Only one what?
Alex-San, another fax from Tommy.
"A little something to read on the flight home.
I thought this might interest you. "
Well, that's it for me.
I'm off to New York tonight.
Better document that last crate.
The man wants vinyl when he can have the real thing?
I don't think so.
Come on.
Why don't you come here a little bit and make yourself comfortable?
You nice, big boy.
Come on, you little devil.
Silent type, huh?
It fine by me, baby.
But I'm telling you...
no glove...
No love.
What you waiting for, honey?
Come on, baby.
So after three days, this better be good.
Well, it wasn't easy, but I finally determined the cause of death.
All right, now that we've had our little joke, what else you got?
Nothin'.
Besides havin' his head cut off, he's in perfect health.
No broken bones, no cavities, no organ deterioration.
Like a newborn baby.
Find out who he is?
He's nobody.
No prints, no dental, no nothin'.
It's like he never existed.
So what do you really think, Howard?
Mmm.
I think you better not smoke in here, Lieutenant.
What's this guy doin' in New York City?
What's he doin' on the planet?
Thanks, Howard!
MacLeods.
But I checked it.
Same pattern, didn't match up.
Apparently, this alteration in the color...
Denotes a branch of the clan that broke away in, I think, 1536.
Some incident occurred that year...
Involving a Connor MacLeod who was driven from his home,
Accused of wielding powers thought to have been unnatural.
So in defiance, the father altered this insignia to honor the son's lineage,
But there's been no record of this branch ever since.
Except for a piece of cloth.
Which could now place one of them in a Japanese cave a few years later.
Yeah, but what would a Scot be doing there?
What if he was one of these Gaelic mystics?
Nakano's initiates were said to have been great sorcerers, right?
- Yeah.
- None of the legends refer to where they came from.
Interesting theory, but, Alex, no records, no proof.
Once a year, the MacLeods meet at Dunvegan Castle, Isle of Skye.
According to the registrar, this entry was made in 1986,
Some antique dealer claiming to be a direct descendant...
Of this particular branch.
So where's this guy from?
New York.
They faxed me his address.
What?
You're gonna harass some poor guy about his ancestors?
- He's gonna think you're crazy.
- Perhaps.
Then again, at this point,
It may be my only link to Nakano.
Well...
I'm off.
Bye, Tommy.
I'll tell security you're working late.
Thanks.
- What do you call this place?
- Excuse me?
This place, here.
What do you call it?
Uh...
A museum, but we're closed.
Museum.
Ah, no, please.
I'm your biggest fan.
You see, I saw you on television.
I'm a big historian myself really.
Ah, this looks familiar.
Oh, isn't it amazing how the present just can't seem to escape the past?
C
- Can I help you with something?
No, no, no.
I'm just a...
Just doing a little research.
Ooh, look at this cave.
Little small, eh?
And what does your museum call it?
- A model.
- A model.
And you?
Um, um, a vision of a past reality, I suppose.
Oh, reality.
No, not reality.
Reality is so boring.
I much prefer...
Illusion or fantasy,
A little hocus pocus and maybe a little...
Maybe a little bit of...
Hanky-Panky, huh?
Connor MacLeod.
Don't worry, my prissy, I'll find him.
I'm gonna find him.
Burn it down.
I'm outside the Japanese Spiritual Center in Queens.
Hyah!
Ya!
- Good to have you back, Nash.
- Good to see you, Charlie.
Hyah!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Whooo-Oh!
Come on.
Come on.
Hyah!
I wish we could go on like this for a thousand years.
What do you wish?
MacLeod?
That he had better timing.
What do you want, Pierre?
I have bad news.
They need you in Paris.
Why now?
The revolution has started.
You must leave the girl.
Come now, my friend.
If not for you, then do it for her.
You're not coming back, are you?
You have to get back to England.
- It won't be safe here.
- No one is safe now.
Connor.
Take this.
Russell Nash?
- Excuse me?
- Sorry.
Are you Russell Nash?
- What if I am?
- I'm looking for the previous owner of your shop,
A Connor MacLeod.
You wouldn't happen to know where I could find him, would you?
Did you follow me?
Yes.
I haven't seen him in eight years.
Do...
Do you know if he's still in the area?
I wish I could help you, Miss Johnson.
How do you know my name?
Well, you're, uh... discovery in Japan has made you famous.
You're obviously...
Interested in Japan yourself, Mr. Nash.
Strange food.
Good cars.
Tough deals.
Listen, it's getting late.
Good night, Miss Johnson.
Look, Mr. Nash, I don't mean to bother you,
But you're my only link to this Connor MacLeod.
Try the phone book.
There's plenty of MacLeods in New York.
Well, thanks, but I'm only looking for one.
So am I.
Four hundred years...
Is a long time to hate.
Ohh.
And you never wrote.
But hate feeds you.
It focuses the mind.
Keeps you warm.
Gives you hope.
Eh, MacLeod?
Don't worry about the girl.
She's not really my type.
A little too... pale.
Then again, this being the 90s, I, I could make an exception, huh?
After all, I've got so much catching up to do.
This is a Buddhist shrine, Kane,
And we can't fight on holy ground.
Oh, well...
I guess I'll be the judge of that.
Hyah!
Oooh.
Nothing!
There can be only...
One!
After 400 years, patience is a virtue.
Jesus Christ!
I'm goin' in!
Listen!
Whatever you saw, you saw nothing.
You don't know what you're getting yourself into.
Stay away.
Freeze!
Police!
One more thing I think you should know about:
There was a woman.
Worked with us once in a while.
Brenda.
Brenda Wyatt.
- What about her?
- Well, she was fascinated by...
The murders, the swords...
the whole thing.
Lieutenant, it's what, 5:00 in the morning?
They scraped her off a highway in Scotland seven years ago.
She was killed instantly,
But he walked away...
without a scratch.
Sad for him.
So, are you sure you didn't see anything?
- Miss Johnson!
- Sorry.
No.
Russell Nash is a dangerous man.
Now I suggest you stay away from him.
That's exactly what he said.
Please, my friend.
For the revolution.
MacLeod!
Visitor!
Calm down, MacLeod.
If you die,
We lose a great warrior against evil.
I'm here to take your place.
Go home and sleep it off.
Come on.
I'm tired of this eternal life.
Death would release me from my pain.
Come on, Pierre.
Go home.
I'm not going anywhere.
It's time, Mr. MacLeod.
When he wakes up, throw him out.
God be with you.
For treason against the King of France.
Connor MacLeod.
Connor!
Connor!
Connor!
Oh, Sarah.
Yes?
Well, it was a very interesting evening last night,
But I didn't exactly have time to check the phone book...
Mr. MacLeod.
You wanna come in?
Come in.
I'll fix you a drink.
Make yourself comfortable.
Thanks.
You've, uh, got quite a collection.
- Hello?
- Mr. MacLeod?
This is Janet at Super Travel.
I'm calling to confirm your reservation on the Newark-Glasgow flight.
Your ticket is prepaid and waiting at the counter.
- Thanks.
- Bye.
Bye.
Lot of Connors in the family.
Her name was Sarah.
Come on, dear.
Ah, Papa.
Look, I don't know what was going on last night,
But I think it's got something to do with what I'm working on.
We found a piece of tartan in the cave that was traced to...
An undocumented branch of the MacLeods, of which...
You are apparently the only member on record.
That cave was sealed 400 years ago.
Have you ever heard of the legend of the sorcerer Nakano?
Don't you ever think about anything else but business?
Do you have something better to offer?
It seems I'm in need of taming.
Pleasant challenge...
I would imagine.
Well, I'm sure you'll let me know if something comes to mind, huh?
Hm.
What's this?
Looks familiar.
Death to the MacLeods!
My bonny Heather, my first wife, my first love.
I came back here because this is where it all started.
And I need some strength.
God.
Ahh.
The last 400 years...
Have been good to you, MacLeod.
Oh.
Oops-A-Daisy.
Hi.
Leave a message;
I'll call you back.
Uh, hi, it's me, John.
I miss you.
When are you coming home?
Uh, y-You said you were gonna call me, remember?
Well, in case you forgot, it's Marrakesh 1442.
Love you, Daddy.
Bye.
Daddy.
Daddy.
Hey, MacLeod.
I thought you'd find me.
Why did you come?
Nakano.
You seem like you belong here.
Maybe I used to.
But that was a long time ago.
You spend a lot of time alone.
I'm used to it.
Nobody is.
You don't let people in, do you?
I can't.
- It hurts.
Love and...
- And see them die?
Like the woman in the painting.
Yes.
I loved her very much.
I know who you are.
You're Connor MacLeod.
Born into the clan MacLeod, in Glen Finnan,
On the shores of Loch Shiel.
You were driven from your home in 1536.
- And I cannot die.
- And have wandered the world ever since.
- Mr. MacLeod?
- Yeah?
There's a Jack Donovan on the phone returning your call.
I'll be right back.
- Jack.
- What are you doing in Scotland?
- What do you mean?
- John's on the flight from Marrakesh.
He gets into Newark tomorrow afternoon as planned.
- What are you saying, Jack?
- Is something wrong with your memory?
I've just dropped him at the airport.
Is there a problem?
No problem, Jack.
I'll pick him up.
Bye, Jack.
Thanks.
Passport, please.
You're traveling alone?
Um, yeah, but my dad's picking me up.
Welcome to the United States, Mr. MacLeod.
Thanks.
- Yeah.
- What?
- They got Nash.
- Where?
All right, we'll be right there.
Northwest Airlines.
Flight 489.
Just landed in Newark.
Come on, move.
Let's go!
It's over there.
The green bag.
Grab it.
I know he's here somewhere.
I can feel him.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- Did you see that?
Next.
- Dad!
- John.
- Freeze!
- Let me go!
John!
- Where's the Porsche?
- The Porsche.
Get in the car.
Little punk.
Who...
Who are you?
I'm a friend of your daddy's.
- He's got my son.
- What son, Nash?
There's nothing in your file about a son.
You're a a fuckin' liar!
Nash, what son?
Please, stop the car!
Please!
Let me outta here!
- "Let me out of here.
Please, stop the car. "
- Stop!
Please!
Look at the plane!
There's a plane!
No!
Whoo!
I ain't missing' my plane!
Whoa!
Whoa!
You take the wheel!
Watch out!
Give it back!
Ohh!
Mother!
Okay, guys, I'll take it from here.
Okay.
Good luck, Lieutenant.
So, Nash, talk to me.
We've got plenty of time.
Whoo!
- Hey!
Aaah!
- It's a truck!
Stop!
Help!
This is fuckin' bullshit.
Without a confession, we got nothin' on this guy.
So if we can't charge him, he's gonna have to release him.
Pretty stuffy, eh?
Need a little ventilation, eh?
There goes!
Now, first rule of safety:
Keep your eye on the road!
What's that?
It's a wall!
Okay, Nash, you're free to go...
for now.
- Oh, yeah.
One more thing.
- What?
One day you'll make a mistake, and when you do, I'll nail ya.
I've heard that before.
Let the fucker go.
Your daddy can't save you now.
MacLeod... or Highlander...
whatever you're going by these days.
- It's your boy.
- Dad!
I hope I wasn't too hard on him.
I'm at the old mission.
Route 1.
Jersey City.
Do come.
Dad!
Ah, the importance of teaching young people family values.
Hah?
Smoke.
- Don't touch him.
- Ha-Ha!
Little punk.
- Come here, John.
- Go see your father.
Ohh!
Disappearance in the family.
It's funny.
You know, I...
I thought immortals couldn't have children.
But it seems that while I'm the master of illusion,
You are turning out to be the master of deception, Highlander.
How did you do it?
How did you convince all those lovely women of yours...
That they were the ones that couldn't bear children?
When all the while it was you and your little immortal pecker...
That really didn't do the pecking.
Ohh.
I know.
You must've been very disappointed.
All those nice years thinking you were the only one left.
But, you see, the prize was never yours.
And now, it never will be.
Amen.
Nice little speech, Kane, but it's not gonna save your head.
Where's John?
Oh.
Well, come with me.
Come.
Where's Johnny?
Here's Johnny.
Ahh.
Ooh.
MacLeod.
- What are you doing here?
- I followed you.
I...
I just thought I could help.
Aah!
Aw, shit!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Ooh, MacLeod.
You're such a lady-Killer.
I can't kill an unarmed man.
Take it.
But then again, life isn't fair, is it?
I'll see you... in hell.
I'll be the judge of that.
There can be only one.
Dad?
Dad?
Oh, John.
Oh, John.
Will ya do somethin' for me, Connor?
In the years to come, will ya light a candle and remember me on my birthday?
Aye, love.
I will.
There's a fresh breeze blowing off the loch.
The glen is snowy and cold.
It's the most glorious sight on Earth.
I've found no place to match it in 400 years.
I'm back now... with a woman I love and a son I've taken as my own.
I'm at peace.
It's finally over.
From the dawn of time we came, moving silently among you... down through the centuries... immortals.
I'm Connor MacLeod of the clan MacLeod, the Highlander.
After the death of my friend Ramirez,
And my beloved wife Heather,
I left my home in the highlands of Scotland... and began to wander the world searching for answers.
Finally, I came to Japan... to the mountains of Niri and the cave of the sorcerer Nakano.
Great danger lies ahead, Highlander.
From a faraway land comes another, the most feared and evil among us.
He keeps growing stronger everyday, feeding on the power of other immortals.
Soon, there will be none left who can stop him.
If he wins, the world will suffer eternal damnation.
Who is he?
His name is Kane.
The mountain of Niri, where is it?
What for?
Listen!
Where is the mountain of Niri?
Do you seek the power of the sorcerer Nakano?
Maybe the old man still can't hear me.
- Burn it down!
- Yeah!
- Hyah!
- No!
Oh!
Come on!
Hey!
How do I kill him?
With a heart, soul and steel.
I've heard that before.
I know.
Ramirez.
Like him,
I have lived many lifetimes.
And like him, my gift to you is my knowledge.
The knowledge does not come easy, Highlander.
Nothing is what it seems, Highlander.
First, you must be aware and respect the power of illusion.
You have already lost.
Fight with your spirit... and the sword will follow.
Well done, Highlander.
The sword wields the spirit of its master.
It can be the gate to either heaven or hell.
Just strike at my head and you will take all my knowledge.
I will not.
Not even for the power of illusion?
Not even.
- Where to now, Kane?
- There.
Oh, yes.
This is the place.
- Shh.
You have to go now.
- What?
Shh.
Trust me.
You must leave.
Nakano.
You have a long journey ahead of you.
Why do I have to go?
This is not your time, Highlander.
Remember... they're both mine.
Now, go!
I won't forget you.
Ah, Nakano.
So good to see you again.
The pleasure is always mine!
Actually, the pleasure's all mine!
Where is the Highlander?
Huh?
You age badly, you old goat.
Aah.
I think this is the Highlander.
There can be only one!
Always in the way, old man, huh?
More than you know.
When I tell you to go, just go!
Go after the Highlander!
Now!
So.
Your magic has improved, wizard.
Why don't you give it to me?
I didn't give it you 200 years ago.
- I'm not about to now!
- Yes.
But if I cut off your head, I get your magic anyway.
So... we could do this the easy way... or we could do this...
the hard way.
My head doesn't come off that easy.
No?
But it does come off, nonetheless.
You betrayed yourself, old man.
There can be... only one.
Yes, only one!
But it will not be you!
Hi, Alex.
Good to see you.
Hi, Takamura.
How are you?
Fine, thank you.
The archaeological commission is waiting.
The owner of the corporation is threatening... to shut us down so he can continue his foundations.
They can't stop the excavation now.
Japanese government has enormous respect for such a famous archaeologist as yourself, but this is a delicate situation.
Well, from what you sent me to authenticate, definitely 16th century.
But check the grid points.
Do you realize this spot is less than a mile from the center of Niri?
What are you suggesting?
The cave of the sorcerer Nakano?
Alex-san, Nakano is a legend.
Oh, which reminds me.
- So's Babe Ruth... based on fact.
- Domo Arigato.
Oh, Alex.
The commission.
Highlander's out there somewhere.
And he owes me 400 years.
Find him!
Nothing more!
Just find him.
Where are we?
What's happening?
Nothing really left for you to worry about, my friend.
- There can be only one!
- Kane!
Ahhh.
Dad, is it okay?
Yeah.
I didn't think there could be lightning without clouds.
Let's go.
How can this be happening?
They were all dead and the prize was mine.
So who is out there?
And where is he?
If anything happens to me, I want you to look after John.
What are you talking about?
I have to leave, Jack.
Everything is taken care of.
Does the boy know you're not his real father?
Oh, yeah.
He knew he was adopted before he could spell it.
I hope whatever's taking you is worth what you're leaving.
I hope so too.
But I don't have a choice.
I know he's alive...
and I have to find him.
Going back to New York to the place of the gathering... is not what I had in mind.
Once again, my life was about to change.
What are they doing?
I thought we got clearance last night.
You won't believe this, Alex-san.
Someone broke into the dig.
Oh, shit.
So what did they take?
- We don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
I couldn't pass the police line.
They found two bodies.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
So this must be the inner chamber.
But how did they know it was here?
Look at this!
What, 1500s?
Remarkable copy.
- Alex.
- I just want a sample.
- Why?
- I don't think it's a copy.
John.
John.
Hey.
I'm not gonna be away long.
Well, you better call me.
Hey.
You better call me.
You take care of the place.
You're in charge now.
Come here.
I love you, John.
Get out of the road!
Hey, pendejo.
What are ya doin' here?
Stop the car!
Hey, Antonio.
Hey, vamos, carnales.
Yeah, that's a cold thing, my man.
Pretty late for a walk, hey, motherfucker?
Little boy lost his way.
Hey, fuckhead, I'm talkin' to you.
Nice blade.
Gang beating!
Malloy!
Here!
- Clear the way!
Come on, move!
- Severe trauma.
- Internal bleeding, two gunshot wounds, 38 caliber.
- Vital signs?
- Stable.
- Lucky guy.
- Notify the police?
- Of course.
What the fuck are you talking about?
These aren't bullet wounds.
- Impossible.
- Stop wasting my time!
- This guy was shot!
- You can deal with it.
- Doctor!
Malloy!
- Restrain him!
Grab hold of him!
Get me a sedative!
Let me go!
You don't understand!
Let me go!
Take him up to ward seven right away.
- Ward seven?
- You got a problem with that?
This guy's a lunatic.
Well... it's definitely not a fake.
It doesn't make any sense.
Alex-san, how do you explain this?
- Where'd you find it?
- In the chamber.
It's old, maybe 300, 400 years.
But look at the pattern.
- The weave.
Certainly not Japanese.
- Looks like some sort of tartan.
Scotland?
That's a long way from Japan.
Especially 400 years ago.
Waterloo, my greatest battle.
If only I'd used my left flank before dawn.
Wellington, you swine!
You are better prepared than me.
Me, the great emperor Napoleon.
Keep it down.
Who are you?
Martin.
Remember?
- Your favorite soldier.
- Martin?
- Yes.
- Is it you?
- Yeah.
- My God, what are you doing here?
I had to warn you.
You're in great danger.
I know.
It's not safe here.
Please help me.
Oh, great one.
My mission is not over yet.
What mission?
Wellington.
Remember?
I have to kill him.
Nephew, make him suffer.
- Hey, how do I get out of here?
- Leave it to me.
Soldiers, I'm proud of you!
Finally the time has come and the time is now!
Hip, hip, hooray!
Shut up!
Yeah, man, let's dump this stuff and go.
Highlander!
I am your shadow!
Where is Kane?
Don't worry about Kane.
Worry about me.
You've already lost.
There can be only one.
So what do you got, Vorisek?
We got a body here and we got a head over there.
Now, I suspect foul play.
Maybe you should've taken over for Carson, you're so funny.
Lieutenant, we got a guy in a halloween costume gets his head sliced off.
- It's not your usual humdrum assassination.
- Where's the sword?
- How'd you know about that?
I was saving that as a surprise.
- I remember things.
You, you forget, but I remember.
Hey, Lieutenant, you know, we checked for prints already.
Wasted your time.
You won't find nothin'.
Somebody broke out of the psycho ward, came down and did this hell of a mess.
Russell Nash.
- You see, he's a genius.
- Yeah?
So you know the victim?
I know the killer.
Mr. Nash.
Lieutenant John Stenn, N.Y.P.D.
- What do you want?
- Eight years ago, you got away with it.
But I'm not Detective Bedsoe.
I'm gonna nail you.
That's a promise.
Have a good night, Lieutenant.
Whoop.
Sorry, Charlie.
- Twenty bucks in my hand.
- Twenty in mine.
- All right.
- Yo, yo, the brother.
The brother.
My brother, come on in, come on in.
Tell you what, you find the red card, I'll give you $20 now.
Easy as that.
You do my magic.
Boom.
You're on.
- I never seen that shit before.
- Hey, yo, how'd he do that?
Hey, yo!
Yo, gimme back my money.
My glasses!
Fuck it, man.
You keep the money, all right?
Welcome back, MacLeod.
Get back in the car immediately, please!
My son...
I have with me American archaeologist, Dr. Alex Johnson, who's from the New York Museum of Ancient History.
Dr. Johnson, what can you tell us about the discovery, and why is it so exciting?
Well, the artifacts are clearly exceptional, but only after a much more detailed analysis...
- Sarah.
- Will we be able to speculate as to the identities...
Do I know you?
No.
No.
Hmm?
I thought not.
So, what are you doing here?
Well, I may be mistaken, but I had the feeling... that this was the house of Mr. DeFernet.
Well, you're obviously not mistaken.
Ah, Connor MacLeod.
I see you've met my rather spirited niece, Sarah.
- She's come here from England.
- It seems I'm in need of taming.
Pleasant challenge...
I would imagine.
I invited him for the weekend to join us at the card table.
- So you're a gambler, Mr. MacLeod?
- On occasion.
So am I.
On occasion.
Any chance of a preview?
Not at this point, but some of the more unusual objects... will be lent to our existing exhibition...
However, is it not possible to be stepping on the site... of the legendary lost cave of the great Japanese sorcerer Nakano?
As I've said before, any speculation at this point would be a little premature.
Well, is it not true that supported by your own controversial studies, that legends can be used to identify archaeological sites?
It is true that we have seen parallels between missing sites before.
What about the inscriptions?
Do they offer clues or is this some cave-robbing graffiti?
It's probably just some ancient taggers.
Taggers.
Well, Ms. Johnson, so no idea what it means?
I know what it means.
As for the alphabet...
uh, early Russian.
"There can be only one. "
Only one what?
Alex-san, another fax from Tommy.
"A little something to read on the flight home.
I thought this might interest you. "
Well, that's it for me.
I'm off to New York tonight.
Better document that last crate.
The man wants vinyl when he can have the real thing?
I don't think so.
Come on.
Why don't you come here a little bit and make yourself comfortable?
You nice, big boy.
Come on, you little devil.
Silent type, huh?
It fine by me, baby.
But I'm telling you...
no glove... no love.
What you waiting for, honey?
Come on, baby.
So after three days, this better be good.
Well, it wasn't easy, but I finally determined the cause of death.
All right, now that we've had our little joke, what else you got?
Nothin'.
Besides havin' his head cut off, he's in perfect health.
No broken bones, no cavities, no organ deterioration.
Like a newborn baby.
Find out who he is?
He's nobody.
No prints, no dental, no nothin'.
It's like he never existed.
So what do you really think, Howard?
Mmm.
I think you better not smoke in here, Lieutenant.
What's this guy doin' in New York City?
What's he doin' on the planet?
Thanks, Howard!
MacLeods.
But I checked it.
Same pattern, didn't match up.
Apparently, this alteration in the color... denotes a branch of the clan that broke away in, I think, 1536.
Some incident occurred that year... involving a Connor MacLeod who was driven from his home, accused of wielding powers thought to have been unnatural.
So in defiance, the father altered this insignia to honor the son's lineage, but there's been no record of this branch ever since.
Except for a piece of cloth.
Which could now place one of them in a Japanese cave a few years later.
Yeah, but what would a Scot be doing there?
What if he was one of these Gaelic mystics?
Nakano's initiates were said to have been great sorcerers, right?
- Yeah.
- None of the legends refer to where they came from.
Interesting theory, but, Alex, no records, no proof.
Once a year, the MacLeods meet at Dunvegan Castle, Isle of Skye.
According to the registrar, this entry was made in 1986, some antique dealer claiming to be a direct descendant... of this particular branch.
So where's this guy from?
New York.
They faxed me his address.
What?
You're gonna harass some poor guy about his ancestors?
- He's gonna think you're crazy.
- Perhaps.
Then again, at this point, it may be my only link to Nakano.
Well...
I'm off.
Bye, Tommy.
I'll tell security you're working late.
Thanks.
- What do you call this place?
- Excuse me?
This place, here.
What do you call it?
Uh...
A museum, but we're closed.
Museum.
Ah, no, please.
I'm your biggest fan.
You see, I saw you on television.
I'm a big historian myself really.
Ah, this looks familiar.
Oh, isn't it amazing how the present just can't seem to escape the past?
C
- Can I help you with something?
No, no, no.
I'm just a...
Just doing a little research.
Ooh, look at this cave.
Little small, eh?
And what does your museum call it?
- A model.
- A model.
And you?
Um, um, a vision of a past reality, I suppose.
Oh, reality.
No, not reality.
Reality is so boring.
I much prefer... illusion or fantasy, a little hocus pocus and maybe a little...
Maybe a little bit of... hanky-panky, huh?
Connor MacLeod.
Don't worry, my prissy, I'll find him.
I'm gonna find him.
Burn it down.
I'm outside the Japanese Spiritual Center in Queens.
Hyah!
Ya!
- Good to have you back, Nash.
- Good to see you, Charlie.
Hyah!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Whooo-oh!
Come on.
Come on.
Hyah!
I wish we could go on like this for a thousand years.
What do you wish?
MacLeod?
That he had better timing.
What do you want, Pierre?
I have bad news.
They need you in Paris.
Why now?
The revolution has started.
You must leave the girl.
Come now, my friend.
If not for you, then do it for her.
You're not coming back, are you?
You have to get back to England.
- It won't be safe here.
- No one is safe now.
Connor.
Take this.
Russell Nash?
- Excuse me?
- Sorry.
Are you Russell Nash?
- What if I am?
- I'm looking for the previous owner of your shop, a Connor MacLeod.
You wouldn't happen to know where I could find him, would you?
Did you follow me?
Yes.
I haven't seen him in eight years.
Do...
Do you know if he's still in the area?
I wish I could help you, Miss Johnson.
How do you know my name?
Well, you're, uh... discovery in Japan has made you famous.
You're obviously... interested in Japan yourself, Mr. Nash.
Strange food.
Good cars.
Tough deals.
Listen, it's getting late.
Good night, Miss Johnson.
Look, Mr. Nash, I don't mean to bother you, but you're my only link to this Connor MacLeod.
Try the phone book.
There's plenty of MacLeods in New York.
Well, thanks, but I'm only looking for one.
So am I.
Four hundred years... is a long time to hate.
Ohh.
And you never wrote.
But hate feeds you.
It focuses the mind.
Keeps you warm.
Gives you hope.
Eh, MacLeod?
Don't worry about the girl.
She's not really my type.
A little too... pale.
Then again, this being the 90s, I, I could make an exception, huh?
After all, I've got so much catching up to do.
This is a Buddhist shrine, Kane, and we can't fight on holy ground.
Oh, well...
I guess I'll be the judge of that.
Hyah!
Oooh.
Nothing!
There can be only...
One!
After 400 years, patience is a virtue.
Jesus Christ!
I'm goin' in!
Listen!
Whatever you saw, you saw nothing.
You don't know what you're getting yourself into.
Stay away.
Freeze!
Police!
One more thing I think you should know about:
There was a woman.
Worked with us once in a while.
Brenda.
Brenda Wyatt.
- What about her?
- Well, she was fascinated by... the murders, the swords...
the whole thing.
Lieutenant, it's what, 5:00 in the morning?
They scraped her off a highway in Scotland seven years ago.
She was killed instantly, but he walked away...
without a scratch.
Sad for him.
So, are you sure you didn't see anything?
- Miss Johnson!
- Sorry.
No.
Russell Nash is a dangerous man.
Now I suggest you stay away from him.
That's exactly what he said.
Please, my friend.
For the revolution.
MacLeod!
Visitor!
Calm down, MacLeod.
If you die, we lose a great warrior against evil.
I'm here to take your place.
Go home and sleep it off.
Come on.
I'm tired of this eternal life.
Death would release me from my pain.
Come on, Pierre.
Go home.
I'm not going anywhere.
It's time, Mr. MacLeod.
When he wakes up, throw him out.
God be with you.
For treason against the King of France.
Connor MacLeod.
Connor!
Connor!
Connor!
Oh, Sarah.
Yes?
Well, it was a very interesting evening last night, but I didn't exactly have time to check the phone book...
Mr. MacLeod.
You wanna come in?
Come in.
I'll fix you a drink.
Make yourself comfortable.
Thanks.
You've, uh, got quite a collection.
- Hello?
- Mr. MacLeod?
This is Janet at Super Travel.
I'm calling to confirm your reservation on the Newark-Glasgow flight.
Your ticket is prepaid and waiting at the counter.
- Thanks.
- Bye.
Bye.
Lot of Connors in the family.
Her name was Sarah.
Come on, dear.
Ah, Papa.
Look, I don't know what was going on last night, but I think it's got something to do with what I'm working on.
We found a piece of tartan in the cave that was traced to... an undocumented branch of the MacLeods, of which... you are apparently the only member on record.
That cave was sealed 400 years ago.
Have you ever heard of the legend of the sorcerer Nakano?
Don't you ever think about anything else but business?
Do you have something better to offer?
It seems I'm in need of taming.
Pleasant challenge...
I would imagine.
Well, I'm sure you'll let me know if something comes to mind, huh?
Hm.
What's this?
Looks familiar.
Death to the MacLeods!
My bonny Heather, my first wife, my first love.
I came back here because this is where it all started.
And I need some strength.
God.
Ahh.
The last 400 years... have been good to you, MacLeod.
Oh.
Oops-a-daisy.
Hi.
Leave a message;
I'll call you back.
Uh, hi, it's me, John.
I miss you.
When are you coming home?
Uh, y-you said you were gonna call me, remember?
Well, in case you forgot, it's Marrakesh 1442.
Love you, Daddy.
Bye.
Daddy.
Daddy.
Hey, MacLeod.
I thought you'd find me.
Why did you come?
Nakano.
You seem like you belong here.
Maybe I used to.
But that was a long time ago.
You spend a lot of time alone.
I'm used to it.
Nobody is.
You don't let people in, do you?
I can't.
- It hurts.
Love and...
- And see them die?
Like the woman in the painting.
Yes.
I loved her very much.
I know who you are.
You're Connor MacLeod.
Born into the clan MacLeod, in Glen Finnan, on the shores of Loch Shiel.
You were driven from your home in 1536.
- And I cannot die.
- And have wandered the world ever since.
- Mr. MacLeod?
- Yeah?
There's a Jack Donovan on the phone returning your call.
I'll be right back.
- Jack.
- What are you doing in Scotland?
- What do you mean?
- John's on the flight from Marrakesh.
He gets into Newark tomorrow afternoon as planned.
- What are you saying, Jack?
- Is something wrong with your memory?
I've just dropped him at the airport.
Is there a problem?
No problem, Jack.
I'll pick him up.
Bye, Jack.
Thanks.
Passport, please.
You're traveling alone?
Um, yeah, but my dad's picking me up.
Welcome to the United States, Mr. MacLeod.
Thanks.
- Yeah.
- What?
- They got Nash.
- Where?
All right, we'll be right there.
Northwest Airlines.
Flight 489.
Just landed in Newark.
Come on, move.
Let's go!
It's over there.
The green bag.
Grab it.
I know he's here somewhere.
I can feel him.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- Did you see that?
Next.
- Dad!
- John.
- Freeze!
- Let me go!
John!
- Where's the Porsche?
- The Porsche.
Get in the car.
Little punk.
Who...
Who are you?
I'm a friend of your daddy's.
- He's got my son.
- What son, Nash?
There's nothing in your file about a son.
You're a a fuckin' liar!
Nash, what son?
Please, stop the car!
Please!
Let me outta here!
- "Let me out of here.
Please, stop the car. "
- Stop!
Please!
Look at the plane!
There's a plane!
No!
Whoo!
I ain't missing' my plane!
Whoa!
Whoa!
You take the wheel!
Watch out!
Give it back!
Ohh!
Mother!
Okay, guys, I'll take it from here.
Okay.
Good luck, Lieutenant.
So, Nash, talk to me.
We've got plenty of time.
Whoo!
- Hey!
Aaah!
- It's a truck!
Stop!
Help!
This is fuckin' bullshit.
Without a confession, we got nothin' on this guy.
So if we can't charge him, he's gonna have to release him.
Pretty stuffy, eh?
Need a little ventilation, eh?
There goes!
Now, first rule of safety:
Keep your eye on the road!
What's that?
It's a wall!
Okay, Nash, you're free to go...
for now.
- Oh, yeah.
One more thing.
- What?
One day you'll make a mistake, and when you do, I'll nail ya.
I've heard that before.
Let the fucker go.
Your daddy can't save you now.
MacLeod... or Highlander...
whatever you're going by these days.
- It's your boy.
- Dad!
I hope I wasn't too hard on him.
I'm at the old mission.
Route 1.
Jersey City.
Do come.
Dad!
Ah, the importance of teaching young people family values.
Hah?
Smoke.
- Don't touch him.
- Ha-ha!
Little punk.
- Come here, John.
- Go see your father.
Ohh!
Disappearance in the family.
It's funny.
You know, I...
I thought immortals couldn't have children.
But it seems that while I'm the master of illusion, you are turning out to be the master of deception, Highlander.
How did you do it?
How did you convince all those lovely women of yours... that they were the ones that couldn't bear children?
When all the while it was you and your little immortal pecker... that really didn't do the pecking.
Ohh.
I know.
You must've been very disappointed.
All those nice years thinking you were the only one left.
But, you see, the prize was never yours.
And now, it never will be.
Amen.
Nice little speech, Kane, but it's not gonna save your head.
Where's John?
Oh.
Well, come with me.
Come.
Where's Johnny?
Here's Johnny.
Ahh.
Ooh.
MacLeod.
- What are you doing here?
- I followed you.
I...
I just thought I could help.
Aah!
Aw, shit!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Ooh, MacLeod.
You're such a lady-killer.
I can't kill an unarmed man.
Take it.
But then again, life isn't fair, is it?
I'll see you... in hell.
I'll be the judge of that.
There can be only one.
Dad?
Dad?
Oh, John.
Oh, John.
Will ya do somethin' for me, Connor?
In the years to come, will ya light a candle and remember me on my birthday?
Aye, love.
I will.
There's a fresh breeze blowing off the loch.
The glen is snowy and cold.
It's the most glorious sight on Earth.
I've found no place to match it in 400 years.
I'm back now... with a woman I love and a son I've taken as my own.
I'm at peace.
It's finally over.
Hey!
Who's in here?
This is the fourth identical poisoning.
We've kept the victims alive, but we're not sure what kind of poison it is.
Why don't you ask the woman who made it?
Poison Ivy.
She was our first guess, but we ruled her out.
- You mean she's still in Arkham?
- No.
Completed rehabilitation months ago.
Board gave her a clean bill.
And now wealthy bachelors are being struck down by an unknown toxin.
Sounds like Ivy's M.O. To me.
I don't think she's interested in single men anymore.
You haven't heard?
Not only did Pamela Isley clean herself up, she also got married.
Hi.
Come on in.
Thank you, Ms. Isley.
My pleasure, commissioner, though it's Carlyle now.
Mrs. Pamela Lillian Carlyle.
This is my husband, Steven.
Hello, commissioner.
Nice to see you again.
Dr. Carlyle is our liaison between the board at Arkham and the police.
You also teach classes on criminal psychology at Gotham State.
I've read some of your works.
They were very impressive.
Thank you.
But I get the feeling this isn't a social call.
Someone is poisoning and robbing wealthy young men.
As painful as it sounds, all clues point to your wife.
- That's outrageous.
Pamela hasn't...
- Darling, please.
Batman, I don't doubt that I was your first, and probably only, suspect.
Over the years, you and I have had a rather intense relationship.
But that's all in the past, believe me.
I look back on what I was, and I shudder.
Locked away in Arkham with the obsessed and the insane and me just as lost as any of them.
And then I met Steven.
His love and guidance brought me into the light again.
- Mom, Dad, the Batmobile's outside!
- It is, it is.
We saw it.
Cool.
Batman's really here.
Mommy, you didn't tell us you know Batman.
That was a long time ago, sweetie.
These are my boys, Chris and Kelly.
- Hi.
- Can we ride in your car?
Come on, guys.
Let's leave Mom alone for a minute.
Bye, Batman.
I never thought about having kids before.
I can't.
Nature's little tradeoff for my hyper immune system.
And yet when I met Steven's boys, something inside me just melted.
I guess there really does come a time when a woman wants more in her life.
At least this woman does.
Steven doesn't care about my past.
He and the boys accept me for who I am now.
I don't know who has been duplicating my old crimes but I can assure you, gentlemen, Poison Ivy is dead.
Don't tell me the great Dick Grayson is spending the night in for a change?
Hey, we got finals coming up.
But what about those cheerleaders I always see chasing you around?
Can't they help you pass calculus?
- That's not the reason I asked you over.
- Oh, no?
No.
I just thought it would be fun to get together and study and talk and...
And?
Hello?
It's me.
Oh, hi.
I wasn't expecting to hear from you tonight.
I'd better go.
Do you have company?
- Not anymore.
- Sorry.
I need you to check on a teacher there at GSU.
Steven Carlyle.
I was in his class last year.
Nice guy.
- He's not in trouble, is he?
- Possibly.
See what you can find on him.
Family history, places he's worked, anything.
Right.
I'll check back with you later.
Cindy?
I'm so sorry.
It's all my fault.
If only I hadn't left him.
It's all right.
I had just gone back to my room when I heard a loud crash.
I ran down here, and Dick was gone.
- And you saw no one leaving the dorm?
- No.
I don't think Dick is the only victim.
You mean they kidnapped him to get at me.
It fits the pattern.
Wealthy single men, all targets of robberies.
Only, in your case, you have something more valuable to hold for ransom.
My ward.
Keep driving, or your neck gets a new air hole.
What do you want?
I do the talking.
Bring 5 million in cash to the docks tomorrow midnight.
Come alone, or the kid is history.
Nod if you understand.
Smart boy.
I expect there's no other option?
The money's not important.
Getting Dick back is.
Agreed, Master Bruce.
But even so, didn't the kidnapper leave some clue for Batman to follow?
Just my torn shirt.
I'll have to fall back on my instincts.
And right now they're saying Ivy's fairytale lifestyle isn't everything it seems.
Wait for me, guys.
Bye, honey.
Love you.
What's she doing now, sir?
Buying squash.
I've been keeping tabs on her all morning.
She's done nothing more incriminating than return an overdue video.
- Even paid the late fee.
- Could it be Poison Ivy truly has reformed?
I want to believe it.
Why can't I?
The greenhouse checks out too.
Nothing but plants and flowers.
Sir?
Later.
- Can we watch cartoons?
- After your homework.
This is a dead end.
I haven't found anything that...
There are laws against spying on people.
There are laws against poisoning them too.
Look around, Batman.
I've got a nice house, a little garden and a family that loves me.
Why would I jeopardize that?
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
I'm beginning to think you're right.
Batman?
Good luck.
You too, Mrs. Carlyle.
Wayne, kick the case over here.
Let me see the boy.
The money.
Now.
Send out the boy.
You hear me?
I hear you.
Goodbye, Mr. Wayne.
Time to hit the drink.
I guess I should be grateful that thing used a fist on me and not poison.
Right.
But we're still in the dark as to who's behind this.
You don't think it's plant lady?
All she wants is to be left alone with her husband and sons.
- Sons?
- Carlyle's two boys, Chris and Kelly.
I know Chris and Kelly.
I was in Carlyle's class when his ex brought them to visit last year.
I thought Carlyle had custody.
Nope.
And here's another shocker for you.
Chris and Kelly are girls.
No sign of Ivy.
- What's that?
- Insurance.
Plastic?
Just a happy little homemaker, huh?
- Dr. Carlyle?
- Help me.
She's insane.
Has to be stopped.
- You don't know what she's done.
- Mommy.
Mommy.
No.
It isn't possible.
- Mommy.
- Mommy.
I was her doctor in Arkham.
She said she wanted to reform.
I trusted her, let her get too close.
One little kiss, and dear Steven was my slave.
He was useful in signing my release papers and for supplying certain raw materials for my experiments but the marriage was, well, a fake.
And these mutations?
Our children, Batman.
Plant-based life forms enhanced with Steven's DNA.
They're not truly human.
In fact, their life spans are somewhat like certain rare flowers that blossom and die in a few days.
I see.
At first it looks like a child.
Then it resembles Dr. Carlyle.
- And in its final phase...
- In its final phase before it burns itself out the creature becomes my willing enforcer and bodyguard.
Thief and kidnapper is more like it.
It costs money to raise a family.
- You haven't changed a bit.
- Yes, I have.
I meant it when I said I wanted a family that loves me.
I just wanted it on my terms.
Lady, you're nuts.
Well, that's your opinion.
Probably the last one you'll ever have too.
Kids?
That water I fed them contained a super active growth formula.
True, it cuts their life span down to just a few minutes but that's more time than you've got.
This way, doc.
Great.
She gave her little family the formula too.
Stay with Carlyle.
Anyone else want their weeds whacked?
Come on.
My darlings.
Weed killer.
I figured what you were up to involved plants so I pumped your water tanks with herbicide.
What was the tip-off, Batman?
Steven's kids?
You couldn't replicate them as girls, not with Carlyle's DNA.
So you took your chance with boys.
But Ivy could replicate herself.
What?
Guess you weren't the only one with an escape plan, huh, Batman?
Most of the stolen property was still in the lab with Ivy's toxin formulas.
Well, at least we have Ivy's toxins to form an antidote.
I'm just sorry she got away.
Me too, Robin.
But I don't think we'll see her again anytime soon.
Ivy lost everything she had.
Everything she said she ever wanted.
For what it's worth, I believed her when she told me for the first time in her life, she was happy.
[ENGLISH]
The headlines tonight
- Bottomley refreshed after three days on cross...
Branson's clockwork dog crosses Atlantic floor... and sacked chimney sweep pumps boss full of mayonnaise.
Welcome!
On "The Day Today" tonight -
David Owen emerges shattered from Oliver Reed...
I don't think I've ever seen anything quite such... anything so totally wanton and ghastly... .
A mess, terrible and Portillo's wife defends crack habit.
It's cheap, very cheap.
Hello, you.
Prince Charles has volunteered to put himself in prison
In order to highlight the plight of Britain's jails.
The prince made the announcement at some speech or other he was giving today, and said he wanted to set an example.
- Set an example.
The Prince has been preparing for his ordeal the last two months in a practice prison in a Rolls-Royce factory, sharing his cell with an old school friend.
When he starts for real at Brixton next Tuesday, he'll be expected to muck in like any convict detained at his mother's pleasure, adopting the regulation haircut and activity programmes.
The prince's choice - making a brush.
I'm determined, as far as I'm concerned, to try at least, and in that sense it will be my own small contribution towards a vision of Britain.
The American serial killer Chapman Baxter is to be executed tonight in a state prison in Tennessee in the manner of his own choosing.
CBN's Barbara Wintergreen reports.
Tennessee State Penitentiary.
For some, it's Death Row, but for convicted mass murderer Chapman Baxter, it's the last night at Heartbreak Hotel.
Baxter's an Elvis fan and tomorrow he dies like a king.
I always been poor, never done anything with my life, always taken from any community I ever been in.
I figured I just want to die glorious, I just wanted to die like the King, Elvis Presley.
A special death bowl has been installed for this gruesome Presley demise.
(BAXTER) He died on the toilet full of drugs and cheeseburgers, that's the way I'm going to go.
When I go I ain't going on no 'lectric chair, I'm going an an electric toilet.
(WINTERGREEN) Like Presley Baxter will gorge on cheeseburgers and drugs until he reaches 650 pounds.
The historic weight will triggers the current and sees Baxter skip dessert.
Among those watching Baxter get all shook up is Tennessee Presley fan club president Alvin Holler.
Some people might say that this was debasing the memory of the King.
Would you agree with that?
No, ma'am.
The King did that by dying on the john in a big nappy.
A special cheeseburger line in grim Elvabilia has gone on sale to commemorate tomorrow's pan fry.
Maybe after today that IS how people will think of the King.
You could be right there.
Press and protesters conduct a silent vigil outside this Disgraceland.
as inside, Baxter chooses his backing vocals.
I figured "Jailhouse Rock" would be appropriate.
or maybe "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" That always moves me some.
At dawn, all hope of a retrial down the pan, Baxter prepares to return to sender.
In a few moments' time, America will watch the Presley stand-in eat his sit-down meal with a difference.
If he eats too much, he may come out in a hot flush.
So, as Baxter turns as blue as his suede shoes, this is very definitely one Burger King with extra fries to go.
Barbara Wintergreen, CBN, at the Elvecution, Tennessee State Penitentiary.
Tomorrow sees the opening of the London Jam Festival - selling pots of jam, some made by celebrities, to raise money for the homeless.
With me is one of the organiser, Janet Breen.
Thanks for joining us.
- Janet, good to see you.
This must have taken a heck of a lot of organising.
- Yes it has, actually,
To get all the celebrities to contribute their jam has really been quite an operation.
- How much of your time did you put into it?
- Oh, I would say at least six months.
Six months?
!
To raise money for a jam festival?
- Isn't that rather stupid?
- No, I don't think so.
It's all in a good cause.
- A good cause, yeah, but how much are you going to raise?
- We hope to raise at least £1,500.
£1,5oo?
!
That's a pathetic amount of money!
You could raise more money auctioning dogs!
Well, I don't think so.
I, I, I think it's all in a good cause and very worthwhile-
You persuaded these celebrities to waste their time donating to it?
- Yes.
- Well, who?
Er, Glenys Kinnock we've got, and Sebastian Coe-
I hate Sebastian Coe!
Well, I feel he's made a very worthwhile contribution...
- What, To the paltry sum of £1,500?
- Yes!
- Is that worth six months of your time?
- Well I think it is
I don't think it is at all!
I think the only reason you've done it is to make yourself look important
How dare you come on this programme and say "Hey look at me, I'm raising £1,500 for the homeless."
You could make more money by sitting outside a tube station with your hat on the ground, even if you were twice as ugly as you are, which is very ugly indeed!
(GENTLY) Has this been upsetting for you?
Have you anything else to say in your defence?
Janet Breen, thank you.
Ultra news!
Now comments from you, the public, in "Speak Your Brains"
- The law.
- Tightening up the law.
Is it required today?
- I think so, yes.
- In what areas?
Certainly we have to do something about drug peddling.
If they ran into the newly tightened-up law, would it smack them up sharp, or catch them gradually?
- Smack them up sharp.
- Sort of jerk their head back?
Certainly.
Yeah.
Lets see if we can nail this down In terms of this elastic band here.
(TWANGS)
Would you like to see the law tightened up to this tightness tightness number one...
Tightness number two, Or tightness number three?
- Tightness number three.
- Tightness number three, like this?
I think we've really got to hammer these guys.
So that tightness being an average Post Office band extended over about eight inches?
Perhaps...
Yes, I think so.
Sport now with Alan Partridge.
Alan, you're a keen fan of the law, aren't you?
I certainly am.
I support the law fully.
Not too keen on those that break it, though.
- How do you support it, then?
- Just generally... support it.
What?
Just turn up on Saturday afternoon and wave at it from the touchlines?
What?
This is "Sports Desk".
I'm Alan Partridge.
It's a special desk of sport now, as we look back on some of the sporting highlights of the last sporting season.
So lie down, relax, and let the sports commence.
If it's cycling championships you're after, you can't say fairer than the Tour de France.
(ALAN, COMMENTATING) Dave Bradaur there in the lead, swaying from side to side in his own inimitable bike-riding way.
Klaus Binthere on the inside, pumping away with those gristle-like muscley legs inside those tight Lycra shorts, which have become his trademark...
And I don't know what this man is playing at!
No way!
Surely the judges must come down like a ton of bricks on that.
Carrying bikes on top of a car is not a sportsmanlike way to run this race.
You join me in the helicopter, as we look down on these cyclists that look somehow like cattle in a mad way, but cattle on bikes.
And there's Sven Gunsoon, followed by his great friend and team-mate Klaus Bin...
And the man with the bikes on his car is...
Yes!
He's disqualified as I said, and Klaus Binthere wins.
Riding none-handed!
No need for that.
It was a belter of a season for athletics.
1500 metres there.
Cram...
Not a lot happening...
Quite unremarkable, really...
Oh good, Someone's fallen!
It's Peter Elliot!
Yes!
He's down.
Peter Elliot.
No relation to the late Denholm...
Come on, Petel Back on your feet.
You can catch up with them!
No, he can't be bothered.
It was upsets all the way in the dive championships.
Greg Louganis.
Down, double back-twister, bangs his head and in.
Textbook.
Lovely.
Let's see it again.
He boings down, up in the air, double back-twister, comes down, bangs his head on the board and in.
Lovely!
The judges surely will give him high marks for that.
But for my money, the best punches were being pulled this season were in the boxing ring.
...as he's affectionately known to me.
Thank goodness, actually they're wearing gloves, because I've witnessed bare-knuckle boxing in a barn in Somerset about three years ago, and it was a sorry sight to see men goading them on in such a barbaric fashion.
And I'm rather ashamed to say I was party to that goading.
Two men fighting as I saw in the barn that night, naked as the day they were born, fighting the way God intended.
Wrestling at points.
I don't know if you've seen "Women in Love", the marvellous scene by the fire.
It kind of resembled that.
I'm Alan Partridge.
That was my sporting season.
Why not join me for another one?
Join me.
Thanks, Alan.
Time now for our resident humorist Brant,
The physical cartoonist from the "Daily Telegraph", to cast a wry eye at the week's events.
It certainly has been some week, hasn't it, Alan?
- (DISTANT) Yes.
- And so with that in mind,
Mr Brant, put us in the picture.
Thanks Chris.
Well, this week,
John Major's had to walk a bit of a political tightrope.
(NASAL WHINING)
Sylvester Stuart has today's weather.
Starting in the south-east... where it'll be misty day tomorrow with a droplet density of about 50,000 per spherical inch.
That's rather as if the mist were hugging the ground like an over-affectionate and rather damp dog.
Over to East Anglia and the Midlands...
It'll be a warm day tomorrow, about 20, that's the sort of warmth you might feel on a January morning walking into a heated drawing room after chopping wood.
And, finally, into the north of England and Scotland...
A strong and highly long-lasting day tomorrow, with hail aimed down vertically from above, and there'll be a 30% chance.
The summary, then - breezes.
And that's all the weather.
The law.
We're looking at the letter of the law.
Any problems?
Um, well, I've just been worried about what I've been watching on TV recently about all these fit-ups.
- What about a poster campaign to promote the letter of the law?
- Yeah, I think that'd be a good idea.
- TV campaign?
- Yeah, possibly.
Yeah.
- And how quickly would you like to see this sort of action taken?
- Immediately, yes.
Here we are in the immediately future, looking at a poster on the wall of the letter of the law.
Red on blue - what letter is it?
What single letter, the letter of the law?
- Agh.
- Mmm?
- Agh.
What letter is it?
- "A"...
- No, no, what letter is it?
- Erm...
- What letter is it?
The letter of the law.
- "J".
- "J".
In red, on blue?
- Yeah.
"Enviromation" from me, Rosie May.
Britain is soon to have its first portable cemetery.
The cemetery, which opens to the size of a football pitch and features real soil, holds up to a thousand corpses.
The portable cemetery saves waste.
Scientists in Alaska have found a gap between the horizon and the earth.
The gap, which is nine miles across, is believed to have been caused by recent storms which tore the horizon from its moorings.
A team of civil engineers has now set off to lash the horizon back down with steel.
I'm Rosie May, and this is my planet.
Take a look at this.
This is St Barley's church in Coventry.
That sequence will be featured in a full report on the Church of England which is coming up now.
If you mention the Church of England to most people, they will immediately think of the sacraments and the holy blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.
But to many within the Church, there is another ritual - the ritual of the bullying ritual.
Ex-curate Peter Litterton was intimidated by his very first vicar.
I went to the bathroom to wash after dinner, and I found my flannel in the toilet.
Another time, I went into the bathroom and all the bristles, bar one, had been cut off my toothbrush.
Another time, he put bleach in my shaving cream,
- and Mrs Cape stifled a giggle.
- I see.
This is St Barley's church in Coventry.
Barley's vicar Bobby Sky is a former bully himself, but has now decided to speak out.
If a young deacon was being inordinated, then during the inordination ceremony, we would hum during his sermon.
So we would be going, "Mmmmmmm..."
He'd be trying to speak, not knowing who was humming.
- How many of you were humming?
- About 200 of us, 200 vicars all going, "Mmmmmm..."
But while some are brave enough to speak out, others are still quietly being beaten up.
Here in the vestry of St Champs in Coventry, we've secretly rigged up one of our cameras to record some bad ecclesiastical hurting.
I'm sorry, Bishop, I'll do it again.
"I'm sorry Bishop, I'll do it again." Why are you always being such an arse, hmm?
- I don't know, Bishop.
- "I don't know, Bishop, I don't know, Bishop."
- Fold it properlyl
- Yes, Bishop.
(BISHOP LAUGHS)
Yes, I was collecting up the hymn books.
Books very...
Well, these exact books, and I was stacking them...
like so.
- Yes.
- I'd stacked up to my chin, so I was really at full stretch with about 30 hymn books, and he said, " Come on, Peter.
You can fit another one in there!
."
I said "No, I can't, I really can't," and he pushed one in ..
"You can fit another one in." I said, "I can't," and he pulled my hair right back, so my head was like this
I thought I was going to choke.
Then he ran along this pew like that and threw the books and yelled "Pick them up!" "Pick them up!"
You do look a rather foolish boy, Paul.
Clean it up.
We'll be back later.
(GIGGLES)
The bullying has got to stop.
Stop the bullying.
Start taking care of your flock.
Pick on someone your own size.
God's bigger than all of us.
And since we've recorded that report, everyone featured in it has lost their hair.
"The Day Today"
- Slamming the wasps from the pure apple of truth.
The Home Secretary's new measures for dealing with neighbourhood noise have been introduced this week by Broxbourne police, and it looks like they're working.
Noisy people have been a problem in Broxbourne for years.
But now if police receive more than five complaints against a single household, they just turn up and release a tiger through the front door.
So far, they say the Home Secretary's new measures have been 100% successful.
(SCREAMING)
This weekend, BBC2 celebrates changing attitudes in the last 35 years of television in "Attitudes Night".
Well Here we are at the hanging.
It's a very sombre atmosphere.
The condemned man has just arrived with the executioner, Mr Albert Marsh, who's highly respected...
The evening begins with a chance to savour again Great Britain's last televised hanging.
He's using a nylon-hemp mix rope tonight for the first time ever
That's what he wanted, that's what he's got.
It's to guarantee extra strength...
What can I do you for?
The '60s saw television breaking taboos again and again, with "Frampton Row" the first popular weekly serial to use swear words.
I'm not made o' money, especially since Eddie Copfield and his bloomin' lids.
- Oh, aye.
- Go on then.
I'll have the "Express".
- Here y'are, you big hairy cock.
- Ta.
- Ta-ra, Stan.
- Ta-ra, you shitter.
These days, it's very fashionable among young people to do what I'm doing now.
I'm being fellated by a young girl known as a "groupie".
It's an interesting feeling and certainly quite relaxing.
Well, it's half an hour later.
My initial reaction was one of intense joy, but that's now been replaced by a vague feeling of inadequacy and gloom.
It's not an experience which I can see catching on, but neither is it one which I regret.
But while some programmes broke taboos, others, like "Them Next Door", would in time become taboo themselves.
[WOMAN:
It's him from next door again.]
- What's he want now, eh?
- Ah, Mr Eddie.
Ah, Mr Eddie.
I was wondering if I could be borrowing a cup of sugar for my lunch.
- What did he say?
- He said he wants you to give him a punch.
Ow!
No!
You are misunderstanding me.
I am asking for sugar.
That is why I am here.
- I can't understand a bleedin' word he's saying!
- He says he wants you to give him a thick ear.
- Oh, right!
- Ooh!
No!
No!
The same went for Channel 4's "Kiddystare", the show which featured naked two-year-olds romping for the pleasure of adults.
I must say, it's looking in excellent condition.
and yes, yes!
The lights have gone out.
It's a good clean drop!
There's the hanging.
Well done, well done.
They'll be pleased with that.
And to play us out, we have Johnny Stoppard.
- Johnny, what are you going to play for us tonight?
- "Fancy Lady".
"Fancy Lady".
Well, fancy that.
This is Condublasney Piper bidding you goodnight.
Goodnight.
(EASY-LISTENING TUNE)
So join us for the start of the evening with the hanging.
That's "Attitudes Night", this Friday on BBC2.
(CHRIS) Coming up - more cathedral dumping in Leicester...
There was two of 'em, two bishops.
They come along and... just dumped it here and legged it off down the road.
...and Manchester police powerless against new weapon menace.
Well, basically, one of these and one of these have a range of 50 feet and can bring down a helicopter.
Time now for business with Collately Sisters.
- Thanks, Chris.
- Take her off the monitor, I don't want to see her face.
No let-up today for British manufacturers.
There were large profit slumps for Securivadge and United Haha.
Down 6.4, Joanny Collins perhaps units on a lower third rung.
There was better news for Edge-Ledge-Wedge-Barge, who mustered 2.41 up 88 very slightly but Oxymacgee flew back a ninth despite a creeping bid from Connected Breathdumps at four.
On the currency markets, how did the pound fare?
A quick glance at the currency cat.
Not too well I'm afraid, there's a disconcerting 47 degree slope against the dollar, yen and Deutschmark.
And if you project, in four months, the pound leg is effectively amputated, leading to a rogue leg with no hip constituency at all.
Overall then for tomorrow's markets - good evening.
Slightly fractuous in the nines and sevens.
Chris.
Alternative medicine has been growing steadily in popularity for the last seven and a half years.
The latest fad is sending thousands of patients scurrying to a medieval hospital in Dartmouth.
Iggy Pop Barker reports.
(CHANTS)
Bile chanting.
You won't have received this kind of treatment before, unless you're 500 years old.
The Sancter's hospital in Dartmouth specialises in medieval healthcare and offers a range of historic remedies at 21st-century prices.
Right.
There.
This should really get rid of the melancholy here.
Sore a bit?
Physical complaints, like the hardened lump on this woman's foot, are treated as symptoms of spiritual disorder.
I'm going to make an incision here, make the incision all the way round here and the other side, and then cut through, and then remove this...
- this foot...
- Right.
...remove that and take it away and bury it with some... gooseberries...
This woman is a witch and is being talked through the drowning procedure.
- What we'll be doing is pushing you in this pool...
- I see.
If you sink to the bottom, you're clear.
If you float to the top, obviously we're gonna have to attach some weights to you and... drown you.
- Do you want me to walk down the stairs?
- Walk down.
I'll give you a bit of a shove.
(CHANTS)
Dr Philip Yohansen is Europe's leading practitioner of bile chanting.
He was one of four doctors and ten patients killed in this morning's blaze.
Firemen say the chance of finding anyone else alive is minimal.
Real events shot by chance on amateur cameras are increasingly putting professional news crews out of business.
Remedy Malahide reports.
A common studio accident - a man being electrocuted in the face by a loose cable.
But what made the accident uncommon was that it was caught on one of these a home camcorder.
Hello.
I'm Remedy Malahide.
And tonight I'll be showing you just a couple of the many thousands of unattractive events poured onto a lens by you the public in..."Genutainment".
First, these remarkable scenes of an audacious bank robbery were captured by Miss Susan Briers, who owns the security cameras at the Norwood branch of NatWest.
The real capturing happened soon after.
Our reality eyefest continues courtesy of a St John's Ambulance unit, who filmed this disturbing spectacle of a distressed caterer who had her finger trapped under the page of a book.
Photo-factuality now, and Mrs Mandy Hell captured these snaps while out walking her brother on Wandsworth Common.
The unnamed woman had been pierced by a shaft of frozen urine which had fallen from the toilet facility of an overhead plane.
Finally, Mr Peter Dexy of Lancaster sent us amusing footage of a baseball attack outside his home.
If you listen carefully you can hear that Mr Dexy's living room cuckoo clock happened to strike in time to each smash of the bat.
But on now to our main visual splash, real-life tales of danger and rescue, which thanks to this little child - it's a camcorder - we can actually show you each week on "It's Your Blood".
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
Every week on "It's Your Blood", we feature an actual bad accident and show how you can avoid a similar fate.
This week - "Chopper of Doom".
Helicopters - machines with blades for cutting air.
Air that's soft and easy to slice, like human beings.
If a helicopter hits the ground at 100mph, it can be rebuilt.
For a man made of crushable bone and ligaments that tear, it's not quite so easy.
In recreating the horrific events of 12th December 1992, we've persuaded the original victims to face that ordeal again.
We also use amateur video footage of the nightmare.
All bodily fluids shown are the ones which actually emerged at the time.
For this reason and many others, You may find the following sequence produces a powerful sensation in your brain and body.
Farmer Chester Johnson uses a chopper for crop surveillance and he flies it himself.
It's ten o'clock on the birthday of his sheepdog Lindsey and Chester has planned him a treat.
(CHESTER) It was a ride in the helicopter.
I knew he'd like it, so I decided to video it for him as a memento.
What he didn't know was that he and Lindsey were about to make a flight neither of them would ever forget, even if their brains were erased with mind rubbers.
At first, everything was normal.
They were up and enjoying the ride.
(LINDSAY) It was smooth and exhilarating, like an aerial motorbike.
Then Chester decided to look at his watch - a watch we later found to have a dangerous design.
The aircraft was now perilously out of control, and, to make matters worse, it was heading straight towards a field of children looking for worms.
By sheer luck, a member of the public, Mrs Maureen Tucker, had noticed the helicopter and started shooting these valuable pictures with her own camera.
After ten minutes, she called for help.
Hello. control tower.
Oh, no. it's one of our helicopters out of control.
I wonder who that can be.
It could be Chester Johnson, and he's got a dog on board.
We'd better call a shepherd then.
The steel vulture of Beelzebub was now just seconds away from the children's soft heads.
(WHISTLES AND CALLS OUT)
Tell him to move the stick just slightly to the left.
With me.
With me.
Steady.
Come by. (WHISTLES)
Come by.
By sheer brilliance, the shepherd/dog team also managed to avoid an old woman up a stick in a nearby field.
While the heroes celebrated, the shepherd's unattended flock caused a pileup on the M5 in which 430 people were injured.
Mercifully, the ordeal forged such firm bonds between the victims that it led in many cases to marriage.
If this happened to you, would you know what to do?
Your chances would be improved considerably if you made sure someone on the ground had one of these.
(WHISTLES)
It's a pocket shepherd.
It costs just £59,
A small price to pay for the gift of a functioning body that works properly.
News jiffy!
Just time to have a quick look at tomorrow's headlines.
"Aristocrat's dung saves village from flood" - that in the "Mail".
"Today" - "Drowned Italian wins Eurovision."
The "Express" go with "Lord Mayor's pirouette in fire chief wife decapitation."
Grisly but gripping.
The "Sun" - "Robin Cock."
The "Daily Star" - "Feel my nose and put my specs there roars drunken Major."
That's "The Day Today" on the day that Boris Yeltsin told the world how he milked Mrs Thatcher.
...out of her flabby breasts...
- Goodnight.
The headlines tonight - Portillo's teeth removed to boost pound... exploded cardinal preaches sermon from fish tank... and where now for man raised by puffins?
Yes!
On "The Day Today" tonight - woman describes her parrot's kidnap hell...
She told me that a very heavy officer sat on her back, others sat on her legs, she was then handcuffed and broad Sellotape taped round her ankles so she couldn't walk.
...and new Welsh minister in incomprehensible energy outburst.
The main benefit of our emulsion is because it is competitive.
It permits the production of electricity cheaper, competitive, and hence enhance the competitiveness of British industry.
Good evening.
The Junior Minister for Health Mr Douglas Wemby has resigned today following revelations of irregular accounting and racist dances at his home constituency of Tray.
Reporting from Westminster, Hellwyn Ballard reports.
Mr Wemby's resignation could spell trouble for John Major's government, trouble it could well do without.
I'm joined now by our political correspondent Collin Haye.
Collin, a bad day for the government?
What an aging patient called Mr Major's government needed today was a shot in the arm.
What it actually received was a bullet in the throat.
I'm joined now by Tory Chairman for Resignation Issues, Mr Austen Straker.
- Mr Straker
- A bad day for the government?
- The media always overblows these things, Collin
Mr Wemby's acted entirely with honour.
Minister, thank you.
Hellwyn.
- Collin.
Chris.
- Hellwyn.
- Chris.
- Hellwyn.
Mr Wemby's week of hell ended at 11.30 this morning when his resignation was accepted by the Prime Minister.
He then walked out of his office for the last time and left Westminster by car... (ENGINE STARTS) ...to meet family and constituents at his house in Gloucestershire where he hopes to spend more time cultivating his hobbies.
He is a keen cook and is also fond of collecting stamps.
Sylvester Stuart has today's weather.
Starting in the south-east -
Devon and Cornwall should have heavy, prolonged showers, a bit like jagged metal piercing old flesh.
The Midlands now. it'll be warm at first, but turning cocky later, at around 12, and there should be some cloud around in the shape of a whore.
In Scotland now, thunderstorms in the evening but the sun should come through later, so it'll be a bit like being woken up in the night by strange men shining powerful torches in your eyes.
In summary, then - dispassionate.
And that's all the weather.
Alan Partridge is at Marple for today's horse races.
I wonder what he's doing at the moment?
- Alan?
- Hi, Chris.
I'm Alan Partridge.
Horses, love 'em or hate 'em, from Mr Ed to Silver, that's the Lone Ranger's horse, they're all here mingling with officials.
Don't do that, please.
It's the 6.30 Queen Henry Stakes, which is generally regarded as the litmus test for Derby form.
Jockey folklore says that if you cock up the Queen Henry, you might as well ride the Derby on a cow...
Which of course would be a complete waste of time.
Let's have a look at the betting, the going today of course moist to tricky...
Diabetic Charlie 3-1 favourite, Two Headed Sex Beast 4-1, and at 20-1 Mrs Boothroyd's Holiday Dancer.
All the rest, 50-1 bar.
That's all for now.
Join us again later for the race.
Back to you, Chris in the studio.
- Alan, have you got a tip for us?
- I was, I did have a tip, but...
I was going to tip New Year's Lad, but his horsebox was hit by a Volvo on the M3.
Terrible mess.
Apparently, he's... he's dead.
So... bad luck there.
Back to you, Chris.
Stop it!
That's an amazing coincidence alan, because last week, Collately Sisters, you were involved in a car crash in which you were the only survivor.
- Only because you landed in somebody's stomach.
- It was a rather cowy night for the pound.
It stood at 3.79 against the German bordello, that's up .5 against the Portuguese starling and down 100 against the bitch.
Earlier, there was confusion in the markets when France and Spain swapped their currencies, and trading remained succulent for the rest of the day.
Thanks, Chris.
Here at home from tomorrow, the new Bank of England £5 note comes into circulation.
The notes, which feature the head of Iggy Pop, can only be used once.
Thanks, Collately.
Coming up
- Bosnian old woman... controversy over new police shirts...
It's blatantly too small.
I mean...
That wouldn't fit my daughter.
...and your opinions in "Speak Your Brains".
- Firing public servants.
Do you approve?
- I agree.
- In all circumstances?
- Yes.
Yes.
- So once they've made a mistake...
- No, give them one chance.
- and then fire them.
Heavily?
- Heavily, yes.
- And who would you fire them at?
- Their governors.
- So they've made a mistake, you'd line them up and fire them at their governors.
- Definitely.
Yeah.
(ALAN) Hello again, The 6.30 delayed due to a collapsed paddock.
They're sorting that out.
Men and women here wandering around like ants on an anthill.
Good to see Platitude Queen, a renowned...
horse, well known for its sense of humour.
Look at that wiggle.
Marvellousl
Don't know what that is...
Two to look out for - Number 1, Zeinab Badawi's Twenty Hotels and Number 3, Two Headed Sex Beast.
Great to see the deaf catered for by these real characters in anoraks.
Couple of youngsters fooling around.
Let's hope that tomfoolery doesn't escalate into blind, ugly violence,
Let's face it, none of us want to see that.
Two fat ladies - 88!
Old bingo expression there.
Although, these ladies, I'm very sure, aren't the kind of ladies who you'd find at the bingo hall.
They're altogether a better class of fat lady.
Look at that lovely girl there, chomping on a sandwich.
Ah...
Not sure what that is.
(LAUGHS) Hope it's not a dead horse!
They won't fit it in the back of a Volvo 340.
Actually, I hope it isn't a dead horse.
Sorry.
"The Day Today"
- Bagpiping fact into news!
The American actor Marlon Brando has been sold today in an auction at Sotheby's.
Brando, who starred in films like "Apocalypse Now" and "Superman", was part of a sale of international works of art which attracted interest from all over the world.
He was sold in the large wooden chair. he has occupied for the last three years to the Vatican at just under the expected price of two and a quarter million dollars.
It's believed he will be installed in St Peter's later next month.
Dentists.
Time was when dental care... was free.
But now costs are forcing people with sick mouths onto the streets.
Last night, I went with a team to there.
Soaring costs have forced dentists to use telephone boxes as reception areas and the backstreets as their chair.
It's daylight here, and the streets look quite normal, but when night draws in, like a great dark thing, this whole area becomes the stalking ground for scores of dentists.
Up to 150 practitioners can operate under this bridge in any one night.
We saw seven of them, all after one mouth.
(MAN) My wisdom at the back... (DENTIST) Turn round.
Just pretend you're yawning and open your mouth.
You need that out.
Probably molar needs doing as well.
Hi, do you need any dental work doing?
Any fillings, hygiene, root canals?
25 quid.
- 20.
- Done.
For the past three years, Hambel has worked alone without equipment or basic surfaces.
I used to do a wet polish with my tongue, and...
I used to blow on their faces to keep them cool, because there was no anaesthetic.
Without anaesthetic, it must have been hard to stop people screaming.
- How did you do that?
- I use to hold their throats with my hand.
- Can you show me?
- What?
On you?
I used to press their windpipe like that-
(GROANS)
Night-time, with the police's undercover social unit.
Kids play with one of these, they get big ideas.
They see a swab, think 'Oh that's pretty cool',
They all want to be Clint Eastwood.
Here we go.
Our old friend Mr Drill.
- That doesn't look like a dental drill.
- It's not.
There's two drills here, they're both masonry drills.
- Can you be sure that was used for dental treatment?
- There's traces of enamel here.
Oi!
A backstreet dentist and his client.
We chased and filmed at the same time.
He's gone that way!
The dentist managed to escape on a nearby yacht, but the dentee was less fortunate.
- (OFFICER) Look at that...
- Can I ask you how you feel?
(MUMBLES) Slightly disorientated, obviously.
(OFFICER) OK, what's wrong with the NHS?
I had to wait three weeks for an appointment!
He's made a pig's ear of your face.
I've used an illegal dentist.
It's hardly a criminal offence...
- It IS a criminal offence.
- It's not.
- It is.
- Is it?
The next night, our dentist was back at work.
Proof if proof be need be but it's going to take more than a big syringe to cure Britain's mouth.
"The Day Today" - aware that while the world looks round, it is, in fact, a cube.
And from this, we know that fact times importance equals news!
Coming up - controversy over new police shirts...
Yes, obviously, we're ready to comply with whatever changes are made if they're for the better, but... this clearly is not going to work.
But first Alan Partridge for the delayed 6.30 at Marple.
Alan, either you've just had a fight with a fire engine or it's raining its arse off out there!
Hi Chris, no racing as yet, one or two problems with the weather.
It's really quite wet here.
Really is quite wet.
It's horrible.
Really awful.
Back to you in the studio.
Your complaints.
- Hello, peasant.
- How do you do?
Would you care to read loud this complaint which you've just written.
- I shall indeed.
- Grasp the candle.
- Sorry?
- And bang on.
And bang on.
I would like to complain about entirely slack monitoring of the shape of broadcasters' mouths.
As a recruitment officer, I know it is a simple matter when appointing staff to filter out those with unusual or disgusting mouths at the interview stage.
Yet our screens are plagued with the likes of Gavin Esler, whose mouth is not only so ill-governed it looks like it is trying to escape from his face, but is grotesquely lopsided.
A balanced view from that?
In a chimp's cock.
Surely the time has come for the BBC to face up to this demoralising assault and sack anyone... whose mouth does not conform to a reasonable standard.
Perhaps mine.
Point at mouth.
Regular, neat, and I've had the stretch marks dealt with.
Do it or I'll ram you up your own...
fudge tunnels.
Thank you.
You ask anyone in the street what they think of Britain's public buildings and they'll probably look at you and say, "What a load of old rubbish."
That's why "The Day Today" has commissioned a special fly-on-the-wall documentary series about every single one of them, starting this week with St Lamb's pool in Acton.
Hi.
Can we have two, please?
One adult and one child.
- How much is that?
- 85.
85?
Thanks.
No, it's not for the phones. it's just for the pool.
Just two for the pool.
Well...
I haven't got the exact money.
It's only...
- Just... keep the change, it doesn't matter.
- No, I can't keep the change.
Well...
I haven't got the exact money.
It's only a pound.
I can't.
I don't have the authority to just, you know, give you 25 pence.
- I'd have too much in the till.
- Just give me two tickets.
I'll keep the pound, but I can't let you in.
Line up along here, please... (ALL SHOUT)
No duck...
Michael!
Put it out.
No ducking!
Stephanie!
Stephanie!
Leave her hair alone!
I've tal...
Right!
All down this end!
All down...
Right, free swim!
Free swim!
- (FRENCH ACCENT) Er...
One swimming...
- Swi?
- Er...
Swimming...
- Sorry, I don't know...
What do you want?
(SPEAKS FRENCH)
What?
Swimming.
I, er...
I go... (SPEAKS FRENCH)
You go what?
No!
No!
No!
No, not the floats!
No!
No, they're not for us!
Not the fl!
No!
Put them back!
Put them all back!
Excuse me, I wonder if you could help me.
I've just been for a swim and I just found out I've lost my locker key the ring thing.
Do you have a spare I could use?
- No, we don't give out spares.
- It's 207, the locker number.
Well, it doesn't matter what number is, you'd better look for it.
- Haven't you got a master?
- I can't give you a master key.
but it'll be in the bottom of the pool.
Go and look for it.
OK.
(MUTTERS)
Look, I'm in a bit of a hurry, I've got to get back to the office, so if you could just give me a master key...
I haven't got the authority to give you a master key.
We need a £10 deposit.
- Look, I give you a £10 deposit, but my money is in the locker with my clothes!
- I'm sorry, I can't help you.
- Give me a key!
- I don't have the authority...
- GIVE ME A KEY!
- You'd better get off to your office.
(CHILDREN LAUGH AND SHOUT)
"The Day Today" - Game warden to the events rhino.
Coming up later we'll be microtometercandyhell. but first a look at programmes later tonight on BBC2.
And at ten past ten, it's "Question Time", live from Wembley Stadium.
Let's hear from the questioner...
That's "Question Time" tonight at ten past ten.
On the panel, Virginia Bottomley, Tony Banks, Sir William Rees-Mogg and Nik Kershaw.
And then at 11:15, it's "The Day Today" special, this week "Camfam".
The Hall family of Lincoln have agreed to have cameras implanted into their faces to give us a unique view of British family life.
Oscar!
Oscar!
What is the golden rule?
Hello.
What is the golden rule?
Yes, you do know what the golden rule is.
The golden rule is "don't touch Daddy's car." Turn it off.
- Mum said I could.
- What do you mean mum said you could?
Mumy said you could play in the car?
- Roy!
Roy!
- Did you tell him he could touch the car?
- No, I didn't.
What are you doing.
Touching the car?
- She didn't.
You little liar!
You little liar!
- Roy, Roy!
Just calm down!
- I am calm!
Don't you...
- Get out the car!
- Roy, stop it!
Roy!
Christ!
After that, a "Day Today" information special from Conor Hammil.
Hey you!
Look at me!
I'm driving my sports car.
Going at 50, 60, 70!
The wind's in my hair... 80!
Oh look.
There is a bend.
Who cares?
90!
Get out of my way, you squares!
I'm doing 100 'cause it's cool.
It's cool to drive fast.
Of course it's cool.
Just one question...
Is this cool?
Is this cool?
Is this cool?
Is this cool?
Is this cool?
Is that cool?
All these people, are they cool?
Is this cool?
This guy...
Cool, is he?
This guy, is he cool?
This woman, is she cool?
So, what about me?
Do I look cool?
Well, do I?
Do I look cool?
Do I really look cool?
Do I?
Do I?
Do I?

Yes or no?

Coming up - 500 more uncles laid off in Derbyshire...
My nieces and nephews just called me into the lounge this morning and said, "Sorry, but we have to let you go."
...and controversy over new police shirts.
We've been issued with these new shirts, and I and many of my fellow officers believe they're just too small.
A week of foul-tempered debate in Europe ended this afternoon as finance ministers agreed new quota rates for trade with the United States.
In Brussels is our economics correspondent, Peter O'Hanraha-hanrahan.
Peter, what is the new rate?
It's 30% Chris.
Agreement was a long time coming, but in the end the decision was unanimous.
What was the Germans' reaction, because they've been holding out for 40 percent, haven't they?
That's right.
When I spoke to Finance Minister Reinhardt earlier today, he said he didn't like the deal, but he'd go along with it.
Really?
You spoke to him youself, you managed to pin him down?
He's a pretty tricky man, isn't he?
- That's right.
- Where did you get hold of him?
- He was in the hotel.
and you conducted a conversation with him about the quota rates?
That's right.
He said he didn't like it, but he had to go along with it.
What language did you conduct this conversation in, Peter?
German.
- You spoke to him about the technicalities of the deal in German?
- Yes.
- So, what's German for "30 per cent"?
- Trenter per center.
- Dreißig Prozent?
- Yes.
And what about that quote you attributed to him, "I don't like it but I'll have to go along with it"?
- That's what he said.
- How did he say it?
- "I don't like it, but I'll have to go along with it"
- In German, how did he say it?
"Ich nichten lichten..."
Presumably you mean... (SPEAKS GERMAN)
- Yes.
- No, you don't, Peter, because that means "Get me a taxi, I'm late for my plane!"
Now, i'm going to ask you a question.
Did you speak to the German finance minister about the new deal this afternoon?
- No.
- And what was his reaction?
- I don't know.
- Peter, thank you.
"Enviromation", from me, Rosy May.
The vast arm protruding from the South Pole is continuing to grow.
All fingers on the hand have now fully emerged, along with sections of the wrist.
An international conference will be held in the spring to discuss the arm, now over a mile in height.
Another pasta slick has washed up in Devon, threatening seagulls, terns and starfish.
These birds were among over 1,000 found drenched in linguini on a beach near Exmouth today.
Several basking sharks are also believed to have become clogged up.
I'm Rosy May and I'm sitting on your sphere.
Back to today's races.
Alan Partridge is at the, erm...
It's his bed, let him lie in it.
I'm Alan Partridge.
You're at Marple with me.
Just a quick look at the betting.
The 6.30 has a 50-minute delay due to a fist fight near the paddocks between two officials, one of them now hospitalised, but...
I'm pleased to say I have with me the winner of the last race.
Come here!
Mickey Doolan.
Hello.
How are you?
- I'm very well.
- Are you now?
How do you feel about that race there?
You won the race, the last race.
How do you feel about that?
Well, I'm very pleased to have won the race.
It was a hard race, but I won it by a nose at the end so-
And your mum and dad must be pleased.
But how do they think about you doing this?
Shouldn't you be at school?
Don't they think you must be missing out on schoolwork?
- Well, I think I'm a little bit old for that now.
I'm 33 years of age now
- What?
!
- That's right.
I'm 33.
- You're 33?
!
- That's right.
- But I thought you...
You look about 14!
I'll take that as a compliment, you know?
- Are you really 33 years old?
- 33.
That's right.
My God!
Well...
All the others, are they like?
Are they sort of?
- They're not children?
- Well, age varies from about 18 to 42.
- But you're so small!
- Well, that's the idea, you know
I mean if I was any bigger, if I was your size, I wouldn't have won a race today.
That's why you never see people like Brian Blessed riding horses, no it makes sense.
Right.
Well, thanks very much, Mickey Doolan.
Mickey Doolan here at Marple.
Raining!

The work of he's a singer Bob Dylan is to be reappraised following the discovery of a film which shows several of his songs, including the classic "Subterranean Homesick Blues", being sung as long ago as 1947 by the singer-songwriter George Formby.
# Oh, look out, kid, you're gonna get hit
# By losers, cheaters, six-time users hang around the theatres
# Girl by the whirlpool's lookin' for a new fool
# Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters
# Ha-hey!

Dylan, who is in hospital after eating rotten wool, has so far been unavailable for comment.
Hellol lan Curtis here!
I watch "Rok TV" every day.
That's the news where it's gone.

Hi!
I'm Sinéad O'Connor and I watch "Rok TV".
American rapping now and this American rapper Fur Q is in trouble over his song "Uzi Lover".
During the stage version of the song in the live show, he kills five people on the stage during the stage show, live, as it's performed.
# Cop!
Bitch!
Cop, bitch, mother!"
# Uzi lover
# She's an Uzi lover... #
I set them on fire with petroleum, and then after about half a minute, um... put a gun in each one's face and pull the trigger.
The whole controversy is preposterous.
These killings are obviously ironic.
# Uzi like a metal dick in my hand
# Magazine like a big testicle gland
# Bitch wanna try it, I said, "Keep her quiet"
# Shove it up her mother... ass and fry it... #
You gotta kill people to have respect for people.
Uh...
# Uh-huh!
I did the bitch in, as she lay twitchin'
- # I knew that she's a...
- # She's an Uzi lover... #
You've got to kill some people, anyway.
You can't kill everybody... uh... 'cause you wouldn't have anybody left to respect if you did.
# He was grateful I shot his pate full
# Mother... pig was an Uzi lover... #
When he goes to England later this month,
One of the people Fur Q will be doing the killing to is Radio 1 disk jockey Mark Goodier.
# Cop f... bitch f... cop f... mother...
bitch f... cop bitch f... cop mother...
# Uh-huh-huh-huh... #
And just time for a quick look at tomorrow's headlines
"Arafat ablaze in kerosene oyster hell" that's in the "Telegraph".
"Today" go with "Peter Collins is not a man."
"The Catholic Herald", " Eating turkey at Christmas is like nailing an egg to the cross says bishop."
And "The New Zealand Prendergast" - "Russia elects cobweb."
That's it, that's The Day Today on the day The Day Today asked the question
"Are these the real Birmingham bombers?"
Goodnight.
The heads tonight - teenage boy roasts himself in sacrifice to Chris Kelly...
Heseltine fading fast... and headmaster suspended for using big -faced child as satellite dish.
This is the news!
This is the news!
Coming up - "Why can't I be king?" pleads Patten...
What is unreasonable about that proposal?
...and mad lord says it's not too late for Freddie Mercury.
I'd recommend she went to her local Benefits Agency office, sought advice there, and I'm sure she'd find, as likely as not, that by getting hold of family credit, she might find herself considerably better off...
News!
London Transport say they may have to close the underground system due to an infestation of horses.
A report described conditions in the equine plague as "like an abattoir in a power cut".
Ted Maul reports.
For years, the system of tunnels and shafts have harboured a small population of wild horses without bothering the commuters.
The only pest control necessary was performed by teams of "fluffers", who to this day still remove clots of hair from the tracks.
See the hair?
Then in 1970 came the "crackers", special staff who had to patrol the darkened tunnels every day and kill the horses with hammers.
Now, say officials, the horses have become a menace.
(PA) Due to a large pile of horses blocking the track at Marble Arch, all services have been cancelled.
(TED) Many drivers are heavily traumatised.
Only one today could describe the conditions.
Loads of horses.
At least 30, I'd say.
As the train approaches, they start running away from the train... stampede in the opposite direction, like.
And what the drivers say they fear most of all is a head-on collision with a blind tube mare!
Well, it's instant death.
It comes straight through the window, crushes you to death.
Personally, I think the management should round them up.
Get rid of them.
And in a statement issued just ten minutes ago, the Home Secretary announced that he personally will be going into the tunnels this weekend, armed with a special gun.
"The Day Today" - news from telly to belly!
Now from The Day Today travel tower a mile above the centre of Britain, here's Valerie Sinatra.
- Valerie, how's it all looking?
Nice?
- Well, a bucketload of mixed blessings for you down on the ground, Chris.
Let's take a look first of all at the M18 - that's starting to clear now after that quiet stretch of the A49 was brought down from Stirling earlier on so that's very good news.
The M11 in the other hand is still very busy indeed.
It's nose-to-tail coaches, cars, pedestrians, and if you take a close look, you might just be able to make out a piece of pie down there on the road, that's not going to be helping anyone at all.
You have heard earlier on the news about the motorway pile-up this afternoon.
The M6, M58, M61 and the M56 all collided, so safer to avoid that altogether.
Good news, however, on the A12.
those earlier congestions have now all cleared, so you should have no problems at all if you want to go there and bathe a child.
Finally, a warning to speeding motorists.
police marksmen have now been stationed on all major roads in and out of London.
that means anybody caught speeding can be shot in the chin, so best to avoid that too.
- Back to you, Chris.
- Thanks Valerie. that was great.
- Thanks a lot, take care.
- You take care too, right?
See you tomorrow?
- I will.
I hope so.
- OK, thanks.
- Ciao, Chris.
Bye!
- Bye-bye.
The BBC has confirmed that it's ditching "The Nine O'Clock News"
in favour of a new soap opera, "The Bureau".
It's set in a 24-hour bureau de change, it started just 12 seconds ago on BBC1 so let's dip into it and see what all the fuss is about.
(THEME MUSIC)
- Hi, Alex.
- Oh, hi, Maria.
Didn't see you there.
I just popped in to see how you were.
- I don't want to talk to you now, We'll discuss it later!
- Well, that suits me just fine.
Nice colour you've got on your hair, Ange what is it, chilli hot pepper?
No, just a bit of henna.
- You got a problem?
- No.
You bloody cow!
(ALL SQUEAL AND SHOUT)
Oi!
What's goin' on 'ere?
This is supposed to be a high-class bureau de change, not some two-bit Punch and Judy show on the seafront at Margate!
It's all right, Mr Hennety, it's okay now.
It's just a little misun-
- Shut it!
- Why?
- Because.
- Because I'm gay?
Is that it?
Go on, say it.
You're on borrowed time, sunshine.
And as for you... you can pack your bags.
You're out!
- Alan.
Sport.
- Thanks, Chris.
- Thanks, Chris.
Well, there was a very amusing incident on the golf course-
- Sorry, Alan.
I'm going to have to interrupt you there We've just had news of a dramatic incident.
The Queen and John Major have had a fight.
It's believed to have happened during the prime minister's weekly meeting at Buckingham Palace.
On the big screen now is our correspondent Jennifer Gompertz.
The prime minister's weekly meeting normally lasts an hour.
But today, he was seen to leave hurriedly after just 17 minutes.
It's clear that a strong disagreement took place a disagreement that may have involved physical violence.
Some palace staff said they heard loud swearing voices, and the sound of bodies falling against furniture.
One said he saw Mr Major emerge with a red mark across his face and bleeding legs
Seconds after prime minister's departure, the Queen's doctor arrived at speed and ran inside.
Neither the Palace nor Downing Street have issued an official statement so far.
And a few moments ago, we received this amateur video footage, which seems to show that the Queen and John Major were involved in some kind of drubbing incident.
As a result of that broadcast, the crisis has deepened dramatically!
I'm joined by our crisis correspondent Spartacus Mills.
- Spartacus, this is huge history happening isn't it?
- It's bigger than that.
It's large.
I mean if you've got a history book at home, take it out, throw it in the bin - it's worthless.
The history books now, well, have to be rewritten.
- What will they say?
- They'll quite simply say "John Major punched the Queen." Everything else will be a footnote.
- We're pushed for time can you sum it up in a word?
- No.
- A sound?
- Whaaaaoo!
- Spartacus, Thank you.
- Alan.
Sport.
- Thanks, Chris.
Well, as I said, it really was ...
Shut it, Alan.
I want you to stop.
All programmes have now been suspended on all channels to allow the broadcast of this film, held in reserve for times of crisis.
(NARRATOR) Britain is a nation built on the very scowling face of adversity, its dauntless spirit unbowed by any crisis.
This is Britain at its best.
(ORCHESTRAL VERSION OF "I VOW TO THEE, MY COUNTRY")
This is Britain, and in this glittering sea, this perfect fusion of man and mineral, we know that conflict will always perish in the brotherhood of flags.
This is Britain, and everything's all right.
Everything's all right.
It's OK.
It's fine.
During that film, we've been watching Number 10
There isn't much going on at the moment, but both sides have now agreed a solution to the crisis, which will involving the Queen processing to Number 10.
and returning several punches to Mr Major's face.
That won't happen for a while now, so let's take the business with Collately Sisters.
How many number 10s are there in your report?
Thanks, Chris.
There was a big smell of fear in the City today when leisure conglomerate Bottington Fiasco fell 10%
- There's one!
...leaving the cup open for a hammer bid from Silica Fistfruit at 12.
There were no dollars today.
I'm Collately Sisters.
Onto the money markets a quick look at the currency kidney there's a lot of pressure there on the Bundesvessel, leading to a slight inflamation in the exchange tract causing a negative flow of waste pounds across all international membranes.
In summary, then - seven's a bit younger.
Chris.
Later tonight on BBC2, another probing interview in "The Dentist's Chair".
This week's guest is Richard Branson.
You know, you're in the public eye quite a lot, but at home what are you?
A private person, or do you prefer being a public person?
(MUMBLES)
Yeah?
Well, Richard Branson, thanks very much for coming in the dentist's chair.
Now I'll just clean you up.
- And then at half past eight...
- John Fashanu...
John Fashanu...
John Fashanu...
John Fashanu...
John Fashanu...
John Fashanu...
That's John Fasharnoo tonight on BBC2.
Coming up - the Queen marches on Downing Street.
There she is in a cart... and whatever next in "The Bureau", the soap opera that's got them all in a lather.
My God!
Ange!
- Pills!
Call an ambulance!
- Don't bother.
She's dead!
There's a note.
It's for you.
"It's Hennety's fault."
Look, I never thought I'd say this, but... pull down the blinds!
I'm closing the bureau... for an hour.
A large build-up of air traffic over London has tonight jammed solid in the sky.
Thousands of aircraft have ground to a halt in mid-air and may soon start falling like massive buses.
The air jam started around two o'clock this afternoon, bringing chaos to Heathrow and Gatwick, both airports, today.
In an air jam, there's a 3-D gridlock in the air and no way out.
The planes just slow down and stop.
It's been known for years that airjam could happen, but no emergency measures were ever made.
The last-minute efforts of Transport Secretary John MacGregor this afternoon did little to help.
Is he always breaking things?
The irony is that while these people lie around like the dead, those in the air will actually die and end up like the ratatouille which these people ate at the canteens which are responding to strong demand at the moment here.
Time now for our resident humorist Brant, the physical cartoonist from the Daily Telegraph to roast the hell out of everybody with his pomposity pistol.
Mr Brant, do something that'll make them, , and I mean any politician watching this, feel really ashamed.
Thanks, Chris.
This week, Bill Clinton has shown that, like Icarus, he can't stand the political heat.
Oh!
Whoa!
America now, and this report.
Milwaukee State Penitentiary.
and on Death Row, it's wedding bells, not execution yells, as condemned strangler Chapman Baxter prepares to tie the knot with female felon Charlene Gray.
- (MUFFLED) I love you.
- I can't hear you.
Baxter goes to the electric chair tomorrow, but not before he weds Charlene, a convicted arsonist who set his heart on fire.
I ain't never loved nobody, nobody never loved me.
When I met Charlene, it was like a bolt from the blue
We just fell in love, and I figured well why the hell not, why shouldn't I get married just like a real regular person?
We ain't gonna go to no altar.
We're just gonna get on this double 'lectric chair.
When I put the ring on Charlene's finger, that connects the circuit, and when we kiss, that completes the circuit, and then you know what's gonna happen.
Meanwhile, Baxter's fried-to-be is making the last minute preparations for her impending ending.
- Did you ever kill anyone?
- Only my dog.
The preparations for the connubial killing will start at 11am, when Charlene Gray will walks down the aisle and straight into a sit-down reception.
There's even a wedding cake for this wedding wake, but for presiding minister Alvin Holler, it's the bride, not the cake, who'll end up with the most tears.
I thought, "Why she want to do a goddamn thing like that for?"
Did you try to counsel the bride?
Yes, ma'am.
She sure pretty.
- But not for long.
- No, ma'am.
She gonna die like a dawg.
It's the morning of the nuptocution, and everything's ready to give these newly-deads a sizzling send-off.
(ORGAN MUSIC)
Place the ring on her finger.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Clear the area!
So as Chapman Baxter leaves his bride jolted at the altar, looks like this is one wedding where we all get to toast the happy couple.
Barbara Wintergreen, CBN news, Milwaukee State Penitentiary.
Time now for the weather with Sylvester Stuart.
Starting in the south-east where it should be dull and drizzly in the morning, a bit like waking up next to a corpse.
In Wales, it should start of nice but bits of unpleasant old weather should drift back in the afternoon and the rain will bitch down.
Things should improve in the north-east and the south-west, which will collide towards mid-afternoon, and there'll be loud thunderstorms later in the evening, about the volume of a Thin Lizzy concert.
In summary, then - aah!
And that's all the weather.
Wise words from Sylvester Stuart.
Time now for sport with Alan Partridge Alan, you're a bit of a word man, aren't you?
Um, I certainly am.
I like words...
where would we be without them?
They help you when you're having a chat.
- Do you feel them as they come out?
- Yep, certainly do.
What do they feel LIKE, then?
Euurgh... dunno Something like that.
- Do long words feel different from short ones?
- Yeah...yeah
What about significant words?
what do they feel like?
Alan!
- Alan?
- What?
What do significant words feel like as they came out...
Well...
Er...
- Do they feel different?
- Yes.
- I'm Alan Partridge...
- "Buttress" is a significant word, isn't it?
Yeah.
This is "Sports Desk".
Football.
The Liverpool versus Tanners match ended last night with defeat for the Tanners.
I visited their dressing room.
The atmosphere here hangs heavy, like a big smell - the smell of men together, the smell of cats' musk.
- Bob Mariner, you missed the penalty.
Why?
- Yeah, Alan, it was a bad one.
- It took the top of my boot, it was all over in an instant.
- You looked really stupid.
Yeah.
It wasn't a good performance.
I'm going to take a shower now, all right?
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much, Thank you.
Er, are you going to wash away the stain of defeat?
Um, yeah...
Get clean now, and look on the start again in the rest of the season.
But when you go home with your....
when you go home with your..
you get into bed with your wife tonight, you're going to sleep with her, she sees the stain on your body and says, "Bob, remove the stain."
- Will you remove it?
- I'm not married, Alan.
- No, but you've got a girlfriend.
- Yeah.
- (JEERING)
- Yes!
Shut up.
On to show jumping, and I managed to catch up with the Australian dazzler Katrina Parfitt after this morning's big horse event.
Katrina, quick word.
Let me say you look fantastic on a horse.
Thank you very much
You're like the Lone Ranger on Tonto.
- How do you feel?
- Well I feel disappointed
I didn't quite make it this time, but, you know, that's the way it goes.
I was personally gutted because I love those little touches you had the way you turned, smiled at the judge, a little wave, a little wink...
Well, it doesn't go on looks and smiles, it goes on a lot of skill and discipline.
I'm sure it does, let me tell you, but if I'd been a judge, I'd have been a complete mess.
What about the horse?
How's that handling?
Well, today Sir Danzig wasn't doing too well.
He shied away from the water jump and that's when I really began to lose it.
Well, let me tell you if you have any more problems with him, you can ride me round the paddock.
- Thank you.
Anyway, I think that next year, I'll have better luck.
When... when... when you...
How do you ride a horse?
- How do I ride ...?
- How do you ride a horse?
I've been riding since the age of about five.
I don't think it's anything you can learn, I think it's something that's in the blood.
Sir Danzig...
He's my horse.
And I'll be back next year, and I shall win on him.
- You tell 'em.
- Thank you.
Thank you... very much.
Thank you.
Katrina Parfitt.
A lady.
A fact, alone and tumbling through infospace.
Without help, it could vanish for ever.
Because only this can make it a news.
Here with comments on some of the stuff we've just seen, our resident reactor Jacques 'Jacques' Liverot, who's been commenting on everything since the start of the programme.
Just sort of gets on with it as we go along.
Let's dip into him now.
(FRENCH ACCENT) If we could see politics, what would it look like?
A cube... but with all its corners on the inside.
Back now to the constitutional crisis.
The Queen processes to Downing Street today to punch John Major back in the face.
Huge crowds are gathering there already.
Our reporter down among it all, Jonathan Sizz.
Thank you very much.
It really is a magnificent potato of a day here today.
This is of course the route Princess Anne will be taking. she is the Queen's second
The Queen herself will be going down the Mall, through Admiralty Arch, around Trafalgar Square, and then on down Whitehall itself to Number 10.
I've been meeting some of the people here who've been getting terribly excited over the last 24 hours.
- It was nice to see the Queen bouncing back today, wasn't it?
- Indeed it was.
- A good quality bounce?
- Most certainly.
And do you think the Prime Minister's going to lose today?
I...
I couldn't honestly say.
It's going to be a close one, isn't it, but is it quite right that the Queen should end up on top?
Yes, certainly.
If you were right there able to administer on-the-spot justice to somebody who had punched the monarch in the face what would you do to them, if you were right there standing next to them bang and so on?
Well, I would immediately smother the person, whoever it was, if anybody attempted to assault the sovereign.
If you'd been there on that day, you'd have smothered the man, Major?
- Certainly, Yes.
- With your own clothing?
- Yes.
- Or anything else that came to hand, cloths...
- Yes.
- Blankets?
- Yes.
- Even a handkerchief?
Yes.
- And what would you have said to him as you smothered him?
- I wouldn't have said anything at all.
- No words, just physical action.
- Physical action.
That's all.
- Flatten the bugger.
- That's right.
And whilst that was going on, the Queen took a secret tunnel straight into Number 10 and may already be inside.
This afternoon, opposition MPs turned up to weaken the prime minister.
That was part of the deal, too.
and throughout the day he received a stream of colleagues to use as sparring partners and tactical pain advisors, including Kenneth Clarke, Michael Howard,
Christopher Biggins and Michael Heseltine.
Mr Major then received strength from supporters and well-wishers, including pop star George Michael.
Our cameras have been rolling all the time.
I'm told if we turn the sound up, it is possible to hear her majesty's arrival and the solemn punching up.
(DISTANT FANFARE)
(FAINT THUMPING)
And to commemorate the end of the crisis, the Post Office has released a special stamp featuring the Queen and John Major kissing.
If democracy is a bra, then the monarchy are breasts.
And we cannot imagine a society without breasts.
Et là.
It's difficult not to feel humbled or even ashamed after that.
Soul reversal.
We're looking today at soul reversal.
Is that a good or bad thing?
- A good thing.
- Would you like to see it happening more often?
Yes, I think so.
Yeah.
If youuuu...
Is it the sort of thing you can feel or does it happen slowly?
Slowly.
Slowly.
Definitely slowly.
- Can you feel it beginning to happen or not?
- Yes.
And what's the sensation like as you experience soul reversal yourself?
Not very nice.
Would you like to see it in soul reversal more in crowded areas like football matches or quiet areas like churches, churches, churches?
- No, football matches.
- Bit of soul reversal on football matches?
On the players as well?
Yes, certainly for the players.
By what sort of degree would you like to see the souls reversed?
How much?
- Er... all the way, I think.
- Well, let's look at it like this.
Could you hold the microphone for me for a second and I'll just show you.
If we...
Taking a standard soul like that and something to reverse it on like this... with 90, 180, 270 or 360...
How much would you like to see it reversed by?
- Half.
- Like this?
So you'd like to see that.. that's the ideal soul reversal for a football match?
Definitely, yeah.
"The Day Today"
- Approaches the buffet with an extremely broad plate.
And more from "The Day Today's" special germ-in-the-pipe documentary on St Lamb's swimming pool in Acton.
(MONOTONE VOICE) I'm the pool supervisor, the night supervisor.
I basically watch the monitors at night to see if anything occurs.
There was one incident - I remember it quite clearly.
I was filling in a puzzle and I heard the noise.
There was a commotion up in the rafters.
and somehow - it's never known to this day - a pigeon had got in and was flapping about in the rafters.
We called a bird specialist.
They removed it in the morning.
I'm really sorry this has occurred.
If you'd like to talk to Vicky afterwards, we'd welcome you having a few free swims in the pool at our expense, because it's very unfortunate, so please do talk to Vicky...
I think this violates the health and something...
You'll get an early bird swim, all right?
- (QUACKS)
- Just shut it, right?
Just cut it out now!
I'm never tempted to use the pool myself at night, um... although, some time ago, I used to go down and take showers, and on one occasion, I went down to the pool and found a woman's swimming costume,
which I put on and paraded around, singing a song, a Joan Baez protest song.
This is procedural inaccuracy. what are we supposed to do when there's a roach in the pool?
- What are we supposed to shout?
- Say "Mr Linus is in the pool".
What did you shout?
"Oh, my God!
there's a cockroach!"
- Yeah, well it took me by surprise.
- This is indicative of what's been going on all along.
- Yeah, you two, just shut up, it's not funny.
- It's not funny actually.
This pool's been open nearly 40 years, and, in all that time, I only slipped up once, to my mind.
I was engaged in a particularly tricky word puzzle, and 40 people broke in and were in the pool... playing around, sort of ducking, bombing and doing all manner of prohibited activities, and eventually someone was killed.
(INTERVIEWER) Given that your sole responsibility is to maintain the security of the pool, isn't that an indictment against yourself?
Well, I would say this -
I've been working here for 18 years.
In 1975 no one died.
In 1976, no one died.
In 1977, no one died.
In 1978, no one died.
In 1979, no one died.
In 198o, someone died.
In 1981, no one died.
In 1982, there was the incident with a pigeon.
In 1983, no one died.
In 1984, no one died.
In 1985, no one died.
In 1986...
I mean, I could go on.
- No.
- Right.
Ultra news!
Just time for a quick look at tomorrow's headlines.
"Today" - "You could blow notes across the holes in his head says Sinatra doc."
The "Herald Tribune" go with "Boiled dog could do maths claims experimenter."
"The European" - "Elastic song strangles Hucknall."
"The Daily Telegraph" and other broadsheets features tabs down the side for ease of turning the pages.
And "The Independent" go with "Portillo's face felt like guts says girl."
That's it. just to let you know that Police are still looking for the actor Burt Reynolds after he stole a dodgem and drove it out of a fairground in Islington.
The 59-year-old american eluded capture after a low-speed car chase and was last seen heading north on the M11 near Saffron Walden.
That's it.
Goodnight.
The headlines tonight
- NATO annulled after delegate swallows treaty...
"I'm so sorry, " yells exploding cleaner... and bearded cleric in oily chin insertion.
Those are the headlines.
God, I wish they weren 't.
Top gits tonight - news presenter sacked in attempt to sell house to David Owen... 75,000, would that be enough, do you think?
..and spiders will never speak, insists ambassador.
I don't think so myself, I should be very surprised if they did it in public, and I should be equally surprised if they did it in private.
There's growing evidence this evening that suspects held in police cells are being eaten by police.
This report from Ted Maul has that story.
Four men vanish overnight from a Reading police cell.
The next detainee complains of a drain blocked with cake blood, and pieces of fat on his floor.
A drunk man in Chatham is banged up for the night and has his arm punched full of holes.
He says the police tried to fill his arm with garlic.
Just part of an increasingly muscular body of evidence that, say activists, proves suspect-eating is on the increase, and that the increase is getting rapid.
The best evidence of all is this - a 'Bow Street Bastard' - a special truncheon, used for beating suspects, which tears out cubes of flesh small enough to fry.
Activist Harkon Peddy says this is just one piece of evidence of suspect eating from a huge list in his head.
-.. and it's nonsense.
Unexplained disappearances from police cells have doubled in the last year.
Records show suspects are regularly weighed and smeared in oil.
But police say this is just standard practice for young offenders.
Campaigners are calling for immediate action.
Without it, they say, thousands of suspects across the country could be eaten tonight by panicking policemen.
It's Just been announ... yeah.
Thanks.
It's Just been announced there's to be a special enquiry into government's handling of the Froom shipping deal, which flew to pieces last month amid accusations of gross ministerial misconduct.
Our economics correspondent, Peter O'Hanraha-hanrahan is with the Minister for Ships, Michael Crane.
He's Just prised him out of an emergency meeting.
- I'm with the Minister for Ships, Michael Crane MP who's just left an emergency meeting.
- (CHRIS) Everything I Just said comes spewing back out of your stupid face...
Mr Crane, choppy waters for the government?
Not at all, Peter.
This procedure was entirely proper, and I think that the enquiry will prove that the government's handling of this affair was entirely proper.
- So the government's ship back on course?
- Absolutely.
- Back to you, Chris.
- Peter, what the hell was that?
This man's made a big-scale cock-up here and you've let him get away with it!
Now let me speak to him.
Put your earpiece next to his head and stand still.
Now minister, there's reason to believe you lied to the House.
How do you answer that?
Well, that is a very serious and unfounded allegation, and I will be making a statement to the House based on the preliminary enquiry next week.
- A week is a long time in politics.
- Rab Butler.
Shut up, Peter.
Now minister, did you or did you not lie to the House?
- I will make a full statement to the House next week.
- It's a simple question.
Yes or no?
Did you or did you not lie?
- I, um...
- As the Minister for Ships sprawls on a pin, it's back to you, Chris.
No it isn't, Peter!
He's about to answer the question!
He's about to admit to lying to the House!
You've let him get away again!
Where's he gone?
- Over there.
- Well, get him back!
- He's in a cab.
- Peter!
You've lost the news!
- What are you going to say?
- Sorry.
Look like you mean it!
Look down to the ground and say sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- Peter!
next time you cross the road, don't bother looking.
Sorry!
Travel now from Valerie Sinatra in her pod a mile above the centre of Great Britain.
Valerie, talk me some road.
Well, you're gagging for it, Chris, so here goes.
The M4 between Reading and London is solid.
That's due to a lorry driver having shed his skin, across three lanes, so watch out for oily patches there.
The M40 southbound is still slow due to that earlier large accident.
Police reckon they should have finished bagging and labelling everything by about midnight.
Meanwhile, mobile vehicle crushers are in operation in Cardiff on red-line routes.
So, if you're illegally parked there, they'll crush your car to the size of a satsuma and simply hand it back to you.
- I love satsumas.
- So do I Chris, but I wouldn't like to drive one.
I bet if you did, you'd do it really well.
Finally, a look the capital, which is London.
Worse than ever tonight, I'm afraid.
lots of cars on Oxford Street being slowed down by their own lights.
So I'm afraid your fast, speedy sports car has no use to you at all tonight, Chris.
Thanks very much indeed Valerie and I'm sure Alan would agree she's certainly one for a fast car.
She certainly is.
I prefer something a little bit more comfortable myself.
Ah well, with me, Alan, it's comfort and speed every time.
A fast car's a safe car.
Of course, In the States, we drive a whole lot slower than you guys.
- Actually, I think statistically, slower cars are a lot more dangerous.
- Yeah, but you can't be saying we should get rid of the speed limits.
(EVERYONE ARGUES)
- Now the sport with Alan Partridge.
- Thanks, Chris.
and it's a special desk of sport this week as we look forward to all the sporting action that will take place in this year's 1994 World Cup finals in America in "Alan Partridge's World Cup Countdown to '94".
Goal!
Yes...
Yes...
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes...
Yeeeeess!
That was a goal.
Goal!
Striker!
Eat that!
And another!
Bing-bang!
Stick it in!
Thank you and goodnight!
Twat!
That was liquid football!
Er...
Shit!
Did you see that?
He must have a foot like a traction engine!
Goal!
Well, it's going to be three weeks of non-stop action, and to help us along, and add a little bit of colour and fun to the proceedings,
I've got with me a soccermeter.
What's that, Alan?
Well, I'll tell you. it's very simple.
It's to explain the group system.
Now, first of all, all these long arms here, these long signposts, are the venues where the matches are being played.
Dallas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and so on.
If you look at me from above, you can see that...this is the group system.
The...
It's 14 groups - A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M...
N - and there are four rounds, the red round, yellow round, blue round and red round again.
That's my colour coding, not FIFA's.
you won't find that with FIFA.
Just with me.
So, that's the basis of it, and as you can see they get progressively le...fewer - towards the centre, the ultimate goal being the World Cup.
All right.
Let's take an example.
OK, round one
- Ow!
- is Pasadena.
It takes place between Chile and Paraguay, something like that.
And then through to round two.
Which is...
Let's say San Francisco...
Not got much time...
San Francisco goes through to Orlando.
So let's take it round to Orlando there...
Just move those out the way...
Where's San Francisco?
Where's...?
San Francisco, where is it?
There it is.
Right.
San Francisco played Orlando, and then we're through to round three, Los Angeles.
It's not... (CHUCKLES) It's not written on that side.
It should be, but it's bloomin' not.
And then whoever wins.... the-then we're through to the final of the World Cup.
Who's that going to be?
Goal!
The proof is in the pudding, and the pudding, in this case... is a football.
Boof!
Eat my goal!
The goalie has got football pie all over his shirt!
I 'm Alan Partridge.
That will be my World Cup '94.
You can come, too.
Join me!
- Thanks, Alan.
More sport from you later?
- Absolutely Chris, with a bit of luck we'll have Sandy Lyle on the line-
America now.
If you have a baby in the States, you may well be in for a bit of a surprise when they 'yank' it out, hoho
Barbara Wintergreen reports.
San Spirito, California, where Americans keen to brood but too busy to breed pay for a prosthetic pregnancy.
This is a Natus, a plastic disk implanted inside the womb, which expands to gives the sensation of labour without being sentenced to children.
There she is.
Can you see her at the top?
- There she is.
Say hello.
- Hi, honey!
Oh!
The cervical substitute is the formica brainchild of doctors Bill McVitie and Mortimer Marcus.
- Isn't that extraordinary?
Starts up like that and ends up like that.
- (BARBARA) Within the woman's body?
- Absolutely.
- Comes out just like this.
Whoo!
At this fallopian factory, people come for a credit-card conception.
The price includes labour and delivery, and there's a hefty surcharge on the discharge.
Among the thousands of proxy parents forking out for this flexible foetus are Anton and Lally Sampson.
We've really worked hard.
We've given him his own room.
He's got his Bon Jovi posters, you know, Sharon Stone, the Red Sox...
But divorcing Americans are causing courtroom chaos in custody battles for their beloved disk.
And outside the Natus Institute, Women 's League protester Thea Peachman
leads a womb vigil against synthetic siring.
I believe you've been smashing Nati, is that true?
Yeah, we have Nati smashing by the side of the road to try and de-encouragize the women who come here thinking that they want that thing in their womb when they don't, do not.
They can spend their money, but they should just remember that they are women and they have a right to live and breathe!
That's the beauty of the whole natus thing.
If a woman wants the pain, if she wants to scream, if she wants to bleed, she can.
If, however, she just wants it to pop out like...
- A bar of soap?
- well yeah like a bar of soap, then she can have that option, too.
So, it looks like this is one reproduction line where plastic and placenta go hand in hand.

"The Day Today" - because fact into doubt won't go.
And we've just heard- that areas in three of Britain's biggest cities are being evacuated due to suspect dogs.
Police believes this could be the start of a mainland campaign of dog bombs threatened by the IRA last month.
This report from Eugene Fraxby who's got the story with him reports.
Oxford Street in London, with three policemen and a knotted tape barrier.
A stray dog was spotted here an hour ago and everybody ran out.
Police then isolated the area containing the dog and told the public to clear off.
Later, they located it and conducted a controlled explosion.
But as the remains were being taken for laboratory tests, a second dog ran out from the crowd.
- It could have been a bomb. the police had no choice.
It was over in seconds - a dog and three people dead from guns.
Being old, they would have died soon, anyway, but the dog, which contained no explosive at all, was shot to ribbons in its prime.
By six o'clock this evening, a monument had been built, marking the end, perhaps, of the relationship between man and dog, which today went from this...
..to this.
The only way police can neutralise bomb dogs is to spray them with a resin coating which hardens instantly to contain any explosion.
The inside of the bomb-dog is obviously destroyed, but the outside stays the same shape.
However, if the underside is not covered, a highly directional blast launches the animal vertically to a height of over 1,000 ft.
Coming up - new explosive suss laws mean any domestic dog is now a potential hazard... ..and an eyewitness who was caught up in more bomb dog chaos.
..one policeman I saw went... (SLOW MOTION) Noooooo!
Moooooove!
and one guy, I don't know whether he was involved or not, was running away...
Foom!
Foom!
Foom!
Uuuurgh!
and then he caught him one more time between the eyes.
It was horrible.
Foom!
Um...
That was as much as I saw, really.
Seven more dogs have gone off in the last ten minutes.
Eugene Fraxby.
The four hounds exploded in central London without warning all within yards of government buildings.
The prime minister put on a brave face, but for many, like Tory whip Peter Goodwright, the time for calm words is over.
..an absolute (EXPLOSION) disgrace.
These inhuman shit-for-souls (EXPLOSION) have no place here.
In my considered opinion, they are (EXPLOSION)!
Journalist David Mellor added little of interest... ..insolent contempt for public opinion...
For Junior Health Secretary Paul Mann, words alone could not express his anger.
Police are on the alert again this evening and have cordoned off a man in Piccadilly.
It's believed he may have eaten a suspect dog last night and could now go off himself.
Sinn Féin have so far denied they are backing the campaign.
Earlier today I spoke to their deputy leader, Rory O'Connor, who under broadcasting restrictions must inhale helium to subtract credibility from his statements.
So, what's your initial statement?
(SQUEAKILY) These incidents are inevitable, given the position of the British government.
You do support this campaign, then?
- The IRA have been forced into this position.
- So, you do support this campaign of violence?
The IR...
- Sinn Féin is a legitimate political party.
- Which supports terrorist action.
Your tone is antagonistic and you're making me very angry!
Since we conducted that interview, all sides in the conflict have had a meeting and have sorted everything out

Guy!
Quick!
Get him into the bureau de change!
(GASPS)
- What happened?
Who did this to you?
- I dunno.
I didn't see.
- I'll get them.
I'll get these evil-doers!
- No, Alex.
Violence solves nothing.
Why did they do this to me?
Just because I'm gay.
I'm gay.
I'm gay.
- What?
!
- It's Guy, Mr Hennety.
He's been attacked
- Yeah, I know.
What did you say?
- I said I'm gay.
- You're fired.
- What?
I'm warning you, Jack Hennety.
If Guy goes, we all go.
- Yeah?
- (ALL) Yeah.
Go on, then, walk!
The lot of you, walk!
I've got People are queuing up to work in this bureau de change.
Right.
Right.
I'm going.
Me, too.
And I don't even work here.
Yeah, go on.
You go, an' all.
Just you remember what you said!
Maria!
Maria!
I would see myself as an individual human being... needing salvation... receiving it through the work of Jesus Christ.
Do you find "The Day Today" comes into this at all?
Well, how can it not?
It is day-to-day.
- Every day "The Day Today"?
- Every day.
Day Today.
- For you?
- Yes.
And with a bit of luck, for all these people?
That's what one prays for. what one would like to see.
You would like to see The Day Today for all these people today?
- Er...
- If your prayer was answered?
They should each enter into an experience of personal salvation.
- Which would include "The Day Today"?
- Well, how could it not?
I don't know what kind of salvation you could be talking about that wouldn't include the day-to-day.

- Hello, I'm Graham!
- And I'm Crispin!
And today we're going to tell you how to deal with a relative who's just died in your house.
- Oh, look.
Dad's dead.
- Bugger!
- Hello, Dad!
Are you dead?
- Right then.
What you'll need is some vinegar, an oven glove, two ping-pong balls, Frish...
- Books...
- Some butcher's grass...
Superglue, some bungee, a salad spinner and a chisel.
# One chilly chisel and a packet of Frish, please!
#
- First, embalming.
- A cup of vinegar...
- Shoe polish on the wrists...
- And inject the corpse thoroughly with Frish.
- Now he's ready for the coffin!
- But don't forget...wash your hands!
# It's the end ofyour dad as you... #
Now he's unburied...
Now he's not!
Lever up a nearby paving stone...
- Scratch on the name...
- # Write the name on the stone
# So people can see what's in the ground #
..and make way for the priest!
- Now everything's okay, stick your chisel into your salad spinner...
- Plunge it into the mound...
Flowers!
(BOTH) Sorted!
Unless, of course, you're a Muslim.
Muslim!

# Yeah!

Now with the rest of the day's news, Chris.
Thanks.
It's eight o'clock, this is "The Day Today".
The main stories so far - The Libyan leader, Colonel Gadaffi, has plunged southern Europe into crisis by kidnapping Crete and towing it to a secret location off the Libyan coast.
Crowds in Tripoli welcomed the news, a delighted Gaddafi waving like a girl.
Libyan tugs stole Crete at two o'clock this morning.
At first, the natives, aided by strong winds, were able to haul it halfway back.
But then they lost grip.
The island was towed to the North African coast and hidden under water
The Lincolnshire village of Vladny is tonight recovering from a gravity quake during which the Earth's pull was reversed for seven minutes, sending everything not secured onto the ground over a mile into the air.
The quake struck at 4:30 this afternoon.
These pictures were taken by Paul Cork, who had his Polaroid with him when he fell up into the roof of a shed.
This man survived by clinging onto a boot scraper.
Others were not so lucky.
I was playing football with my cousin, in the garden there and he Jumped up to catch the ball and Just kept going.
His cousin later rained back onto the ground along with 4,000 other villagers.
The American space shuttle Endeavor 4 sets off tonight on its special stunt mission.
Once in orbit, it will hurtle towards a NASA space ramp fly off the end and leap over a line of 12 other shuttles
It will then return to Earth tomorrow afternoon at half past three!

A brilliant man, and a surprisingly nice one, too.
It's easy to tell if somebody's dead, but how can you tell if you're dead?
Some people have lived to tell the tale... in a short film we've made.
Hi, Aiden.
You allright.
Lucy Turner-Warwick is a boxing trainer in High Wycombe.
She had a near-death experience when in a coma induced by a pupil.
(LUCY) I learnt later that I had actually died.
My heart had stopped for, I don't know, a few seconds.
I could see a tunnel and, at the end of that tunnel, a very very bright light.
I was aware of a figure standing at the end, where the light was
She led me into an open-plan office, and at the back there was a little separate office
She beckoned me towards it.
and on the door said "God".
And there was a man, a very nice, friendly man, in a suit, with grey hair.
I sat down, and we chatted for a bit.
He was very Jokey and Jolly, and I remember he had a little sign behind his head -
That said, you know, it was one of those "You don't have to be mad to work here, but it helps" or something and I thought, well, he's obviously got a sense of humour.
Anyway we talked, and then he pointed to another man in a suit, with a beard, and said, "That's my son"
and I looked back at God and he laughed and said "it's a family firm".
It was very, very friendly, but ... very boring.
I'm afraid all of these people who talk about out of body experiences are basically congenital liars.
Chanticlier Guardsley is Professor of Psychosociology at University College, London.
He is a sceptic.
We have a whole catalogue of examples of hospitals actually manufacturing out-of-body experiences, whereby they attach patients to wires and actually lift them up towards the ceiling, therefore creating in the patient a feeling of literally lifting out of their bodies.
(REPORTER) In laboratory experiments, scientists artificially created near-death experiences in mice.
They fired hungry mice against a wall with a specially calibrated gun.
Food was placed on a shelf above the comatose mice.
If they had a soul, it would leave the mouse's body, float upwards and eat.
The results showed that afterwards, the mice felt as if they had just eaten.
More proof was provided by the out-of-body experience of Leslie Sourfrat.
(Sourfrat) I could actually see myself coming out of my mouth as vomit but it wasn't just as vomit, it was as vomit in a dress.
And then I woke up and I was a woman.
I went into my experience as a man, but left it as a woman.
Something definitely happened, but...
I don't know what.
So how do you explain the case of Keith Philips, who returned from his out-of-body experience as a woman?
He didn't.
But we filmed it this afternoon, There's an awful lot of evidence to show what happened.
No, there isn't.
- Do you believe in God?
- Oh, yes.
And I liked him.
I like him...
I love him... but I don't...want to go and...
I don't want to go and work for him.
Not yet.

No time for anything but the weather, a lot of snow around.
Pretty grim out there, isn't it, Sylvester?
Yes Chris, most of Britain will be waking up tomorrow to a carpet of white dung.
Thanks, mate.
And that's it.
No time left for the headlines.
That's "The Day Today".
9 o'clock BBC2 tomorrow night we'll start again.
Until then, thanks very much for watching.
It Just remains for me to wish you a very good night.
Join us again tomorrow night for a full resume of the day's events, the sport, the business, the weather and the very latest changes in the world of politics.
Same time, 9 o'clock, tomorrow evening on BBC2.
That's "The Day Today", keeping you abreast of the very latest changes in local, national and international news we're prepared to break the flow of the programme if necessary to accomodate newly breaking events often live-packaged by field reporters on the hoof, those who know that news is paramount
and only the most recently-hatched news egg has any currency at all...
That's "The Day Today"...
..football matches...
The headlines tonight.
Euro MPs' new headsets play the sound of screaming women
Bryan Ferry bath mat poisonous say lab... and bouncing elephantiasis woman destroys central Portsmouth.
Those are the headlines.
Happy now?
Hello, sir!
On "The Day Today" tonight - MP in heartless outburst after bomb goes off in Hurd's bath...
One bomb's gone off in the Foreign Secretary's hand, but all he does is say 'Well I didn't need that hand anyway'.
and a warm handshake from Michael Heseltine to the children he is about to release into the woods and shoot.
How do you do?
Nice to say hello to you.
The Bank of England is in chaos following the discovery that the pound has been stolen.
As the news broke, trading rooms were plunged into chaos, even seasoned campaigners known for grace under pressure reduced to squawking the day's panicked cry
- What's happening?
..."What's happening?"
The pound was stolen at 1:30 this afternoon by thieves dressed as cleaners.
They drove a white Montego.
Helicopter police gave chase, but, despite the shunt, the men escaped, making good with their legs across open ground.
As City markets crashed and flew off, the government tried to stabilise the economy with an emergency currency based on the Queen's eggs, several thousand of which were removed from her ovaries in 1953 and held in reserve.
This meant anyone mad enough to seize on the panic selling of dead pounds could become a dollar millionaire in less than an hour.
- How much money have you personally made today?
- About ten million.
Throughout the day, bank officials have refused to confirm the rumours that the pound was only vulnerable at all because they removed it to play with at lunchtime and forgot to put it back.
Later tonight we'll be asking Malcolm Rifkind for his view and asking him why he likes pulling the legs off live dogs and shooting foreign policemen.
"The Day Today" - hommy sidey news.
I'm Alan Partridge.
Hello.
Rally driving.
The championships start tonight, but here's what I got up to this morning.
Hi.
You join me with Susie Herper, one of this Britain's top LADY rally drivers.
Susie, you're going to be subjecting me to some atrocious punishment.
What's that?
Well, I'm going to take you round the course that I won the rally on recently.
Fantastic.
And, er... the stickers - what are the stickers for?
- Advertising.
- It's as simple as that?
It really is that simple.
Um... before we go round the course, let's just explain this is a modern camera that'll be watching all my facial movements
It's the size of a slim panatella cigar.
Um, one more thing - it's a great model, it goes like a bomb... and the car's not bad, either!
Let's go burn some rubber.
Well, you seem quite, er...
Whoa-ho!
Whey-hey!
Hey!
Spunky lady!
- Hence the bumpiness!
- Yeah!
You certainly know how to handle this bitch!
You keep her in line!
I like it.
It's good.
- You've gotta show the car who's in control.
- You take it by the scruff of the neck and you let it know who's the queen.
The car's the bitch, you're the queen, and I like it!
Whoa!
Yeah.
You know what, I just have to brake here.
This is pretty steep stuff.
Easy!
Easy!
Whoa!
Watch out for that!
What?
Don't be stupid!
Watch out for that!
Careful!
Well, whilst driving like she was may be big and clever on the rally track, it certainly isn't on a housing estate.
Remember - lives matter.
Chris.
It's been revealed that Junior Treasury Minister Michael Portillo, carries a sawn-off shotgun to constituency meetings, corners children in parks and chews their cheeks, and has frequent sexual intercourse with stray animals, claiming, "As long as it's got a backbone, I'll do it."
That story we reported last week, and have since discovered it to be untrue.
Paul Boetang.
Do you feel that young people are taking the right cues from their culture?
I think young people make a contribution and indeed form the culture in which they live and in which we all live.
How do you feel about some of the more...
dangerous elements of their cultural mêlée?
I don't know what you mean by their more dangerous elements.
We're talking bang!
I'm talking guns I'm talking people like Uzi MC the Blood Rap movement, Herman the Tosser... how do you feel when young people are presented with the sort of stuff that they're churning out?
- I think it's rather sad, and...
- What, if somebody listens to Herman the Tosser?
...and I think there are very many young people who are turned off by that violence, by that sexism, by that racism and by that homophobia.
Are you levelling all those accusations at Herman the Tosser?
No, I'm not.
Herman the Tosser is not someone who's invaded my own particular consciousness, clearly although, although clearly he has invaded yours and it is a concern.
- It sounds to me...
- It sounds to me, too.
It sounds to me rather an unpleasant name, but he may be a delightful person.
"The Day Today" - the last scintilla of doubt just rode out of town.
The American serial killer Chapman Baxter is to be executed today by the dead body of his last victim.
Barbara Wintergreen reports.
Florida State Penitentiary, and killer Chapman Baxter has dug deep into his past for tomorrow's execution ceremony.
The best kind of justice would be if my last victim, Colin Akavito, could be dug up and he could kill me.
In Oregon's Manimatronics Center, Dr Travis Daveley has been fleshing out Chapman's unusual carcass request.
We'll do the arm movements once more.
Coffin boffin Travis has undertaken to manimatrize Colin Akavito, the man who Baxter blasted in the past.
He's even helping him to speak from the grave.
There's three simple voices.
First is a kind of generic voice.
Justice.
- The second one is Martin Sheen.
- (DRAWLS) Justice.
And the third is my favourite
- Louis Armstrong.
(CROAKS) Justice.
All the America is electrified by this Vigilante victim
He's appeared in a cadavalcade of front covers and chat shows, and has squeezed new life into fruit juice ads.
(VOICEOVER)... zangiest fruit juice you've ever tasted, there ain't no... (LOUIS ARMSTRONG CROAKS) Justice.
Live wire Akavito is dating supermodel Kendal Ball, who's seems stuck on the stiff.
Colin's kind of cute.
He's strong and silent and, um... doesn't bullshit me like other guys.
Do you get to spend a lot of time alone together?
Well no, 'cause Travis is always with us, but I kind of like it that way.
I've got this little dream whereby there's a whole village of reanimated corpses, and if you like, a kind of control tower at the centre of that village with a bank of monitors, and I control all the corpses.
Why use corpses?
Why not normal people?
Why don't you just leave things the way they are?
Because...
Normal people...
Because I wouldn't have my tower.
I want a tower.
The day of justice, and Baxter gets to renew his acquaintance with the body of evidence.
In whose voice do you wish justice to be done?
- Martin Sheen.
- Thank you very much.
You may proceed.
Colin needs a few moments to decompose himself before delivering a stiff charge to Baxter.
(MARTIN SHEEN DRAWLS) Justice.
(AGONISED SCREAM)
So, as Chapman Baxter came here to bury his past, looks like his past has come to bury him.
This is Barbara Wintergreen, CBN News, at the corpsecution, Florida State Penitentiary.
BBC mandarins are bleating again.
This time because their new soap "The Bureau" has just plummeted out of the ratings.
A BBC spokesman said "Don't read too much into the fact that we're sending them out on tour to the regions on the back of a truck it's not to drum up support, it's standard policy for all programmes".
Let's have a look. shall we?
(THEME MUSIC)
- Maria?
- Yeah?
- You know I'm gay?
- Yeah.
Well... do you think it's possible for a gay man to love a woman?
Of course it is, Guy.
There's no rules to love.
You've got to follow your heart.
- Maria?
- Yeah?
- I love you.
- Watch out!
Hennety!
Oi!
I'm trying to run a high-class bureau de change, not some two-bit nipple peep show in Rio de Janeiro.
Ange!
Where you've been all day?
We've been worried about you!
It's not "Ange" any more, actually.
It's "Mrs Hennety" to you.
A cat miaows.
A horse neighs.
A lion roars.
A bird sings.
A snake hisses.
A human... barks.
- Time now for business with Collately Sisters.
- Thanks, Chris.
You do it!
Get it now!
No, you get it!
It's over there!
Arguments like that broke out on the international markets today when economic talks collapsed, and Spain withdrew from the world and began trading with itself.
The peseta burst open at four.
The pound was barely audible this morning, It rotted by 3.9 points against the dollar, and there was further bad news for coat developers Watney Heckbulb, nrrrrrrrrrr, who were ordered to cease trading because of bad burping.
Chris.
Chris.
On now to the money markets, and a quick look at the international finance arse.
And there you can see that the US and Japanese cheeks started off with a gap of 2.4 but increased trading forced the two together to form a unified arse at around lunchtime which held for the rest of the day.
In summary, then - oh, no.
Chris.
For a second night running, London's police are out in force, clamping the homeless.
The new measures have been in operation since Monday and already are proving successful.
The clamps are bolted onto any homeless person found asleep or motionless after 9pm at night.
This is the time when London's street people start accumulating in doorways, many of them drunk and pissed up on booze.
The clamps ensure than any homeless who has caused a blockage is forced to stay put when they wake up
They've probably been sick, too.
They are then prosecuted and punished.
And reaction to the new measures has been strong - so far we've spoken to Kim Wilde.
Does it make you feel bad when they clamp homeless people on the Strand?
- When they clamp them?
- Yeah.
Businesses on the Strand getting in people to clamp them so they can't move away, and they're persecuted and then they're fined for being in the way.
- I didn't know that.
That's awful.
- Would you call for clamps to be illegalised
Certainly on human beings.
It's obscene.
"Enviromation", from me, Rosy May.
A revolution in household heating is sweeping across America - frozen fire.
Normal fire is solidified in special cold furnaces and packaged for home freezer storage.
It can then be defrosted at a later date and poured onto logs.
Frozen fire saves heat.
The echo from the nuclear bomb which destroyed Hiroshima is set to devastate the city again.
Half of the original blast has ricocheted off Jupiter and will strike Japan in 2041.
It's not yet known whether the city will be evacuated.

Today is the anniversary of 1944.
People did different things then, and lived different lives.
This "Day Today" reminiscipackage features contemporary memories and footage from a time when a five-speed, three-litre Ford Capri was the stuff of a madman's dreams.
What was the food situation like in those days?
Oh, it was dreadful.
Of course it was dreadful.
Sometimes we even had to eat bits of the house.
Bricks, and...
The mortar was tastier than the actual bricks because after all, it had been mixed up once, so you could mix it up again.
You used to try to get it off other people's houses, of course, first and houses that had been bombed and broken down, but sometimes you had to eat your own house, and it was better to find yourself without a house than without food.
Electricity was very, very expensive, but you had to have a light of some kind, so we had the...
I don't know, We thought it was quite a good idea... you see babies have such a lot of energy. they're always on the go.
so we used to connect the house to a baby, and that used to keep the lights going.
I don't remember much about 1945, because that was the year... that was my hibernation year.
- Can I have your name?
- You'd go and get your ticket, and find out when you had to hibernate and then you'd be given just a few weeks to get yourself organised.
You know, You knew you had to keep going.
You got into a box and curled up and you went to sleep.
It was our bit of the war effort really, to keep ourselves out of the way.
During the war, everybody was called up to be in the War Cabinet.
And I was called up to be the foreign secretary for a month.
So I was in meetings and having to express opinions and I had to travel abroad.
I went over to France and I met the French foreign minister and he was really quite impressed, because my French really was ...
was rather good.
So we had conversations with me understanding everything he said and answering him, but whether I answered him properly, I don't know.
This is "The Day Today".
Still to come - controversy over new Treasury appointment...
I'm sick to death of this.
It's all I ever get Treasury, Treasury, Treasury.
It's all I ever hear.
I'm sick of it.
I've had enough.
Just all of you, (BEEP) off!
...and new anti-shoplifting measures for a BQ store in Bracknell.
If I catch anybody stealing anything from the shop, then ...
I shoot 'em through the mouth with this.
The number of MPs in Westminster suffering from Slemmel's disease has risen to 22.
Slemmel's disease is caused by a brain virus that affects the victim's ability to read.
They can see words, but have no idea what they mean.
Baroness Trumpington was the first to show signs two weeks ago
She may have caught it from a badger.
Then John MacGregor.
The virus is highly infectious and lives in peppermints.
This was the moment Peter Lilley realised he too was in trouble.
Slemmel's also affects leg-eye coordination, causing victims to walk straight past places they intend to stop.
So, could you...
Hey!
By last Friday, William Waldegrave had little control over his body
- Mr Waldegrave!
- Teddy Taylor followed.
Mr Tay...
Oi!
- And Jimmy Knapp severely.
- Mr Knapp!
Most seriously of all, on Monday John Patten showed unmistakeable signs, failing to recognise familiar surroundings and objects...
Ah!
...clearly having no understanding of the day's briefs.
The second document proved equally mysterious, and the third he couldn't even be bothered to try
The disease shows no sign of stopping.
This morning, Malcolm Rifkind appeared lost when he was just 20 yards from his office.
Doctors say the only treatments they can offer so far are rubbish.

Today's historic trade agreement between Australia and Hong Kong marks a new season of hope for the future of world trade.
The two countries have been at each others' throats for years, but now the hatchet's been buried by a treaty which allows unrestricted trading between all parties at all levels.
I'm joined now by Martin Craste, the British minister with special Responsibility for the Commonwealth, and Gavin Hawtrey, the Australian Foreign Secretary, in Canberra.
Gentlemen, this is pretty historic stuff.
well done.
A future of unbridled harmony then?
Australia?
Yes, I think that Martin Craste and I can be pretty satisfied.
It's a good day.
And if, as in the past, Australia exceed their agreement, what will you do about it?
This is a very satisfactory treaty.
which I am sure will work well
Naturally, if the limits were exceeded, this would be met with a firm line.
but I can't see this being necessary.
Mr Hawtrey, he's knocking a firm line in your direction.
What are you going to do about that?
- Well, in that case we'd just reimpose sanctions as we did last year-
- Sanctions!
Hang on a second.
They've only just swallowed their sanctions, and now they're burping them back up in your face!
I think sanctions is rather premature talk.
Certainly if sanctions were imposed we should have to retaliate with appropriate measures.
But I can't-
I think "appropriate measures" is a euphemism, Mr Hawtrey.
you know what it means,
- What are you going to do about that?
- Well, I'd just have to go back to Cabinet.
- And ask them about what?
- I dunno, maybe it's a matter for the military-
- The military!
- I think military measures is totally inappropriate reaction.
- And I think this is way way over the top.
- Sounds like you're being inappropriate!
Are you?
Of course I'm not being inappropriate Martin Craste knows that full well.
This is the sort of misunderstanding that I thought we'd laid to rest during our negotiating period!
Misunderstanding it certainly is.
it's certainly not a treaty, is it?
You're both at each others' throats, you're backing yourselves up with arms
What are you going to do about it?
Mr Hawtrey, let me give you a hint - "Bang!"
- What are you asking me to say?
- You know damn well what I'm asking you to say!
You're putting yourself in a situation of armed conflict.
What are you plunging yourself into?
- You'd like me to say it?
- I want you to say it, yes!
- You want the word?
- The word!
- I will not flinch...
- You will not flinch from?
- War.
- War!
Gentlemen, I'll put you on hold.
if fighting did break out it would probably occur in Eastmanstown in the Upper Cataracts on the Australio-Hong Kong border.
Our reporter Donald Bethl'hem is there now Donald, what's the atmosphere like?
Tension here is very high, Chris.
The stretched twig of peace is at melting point.
People here are literally bursting with war.
This is very much a country that's going to blow up in its face.
Well gentlemen, it seems we have little option now but to declare war immediately!
this is quite impossible, I couldn't take such a decision without, referring to my superior ,Chris Patten, and he's in Hong Kong!
Good, because he's on the line now via satellite.
Mr Patten, what do you think of the idea of a war now?
I'll take that as a yes.
- Very well.
It's war.
- War it is.
That's it, Chris.
It's war!
War has broken out!
This is a war!
That's it!
Yes.
It's war!
From now on, The Day Today will be providing the most immediate coverage of any war ever fought.
- On the front line and in your face, Donald Bethl'hem.
- Standing by, Douglas Hurd.
The Day Today smart bombs have nose-mounted cameras.
This is smart bomb Steven.
and that is Suzanna Gekkaloys.
- I'll be reporting from inside the fight!
- Like some crazy Trojan!
And keeping an eye on everything, that's going on out there at The Day Today news pipe, Douglas Trox
- Chris!
- But first, the weather from Sylvester Stuart.
And now the weather, starting in the south-east, where the sun should plop through after a dull start, a bit like having your hand sewn back on after a farming accident.
Let's revolve the weather collar now 70 degrees to the Midlands, where I was first bereaved.
And there'll be a large cack of heavy cloud, covering the area but it should stay dry enough for you to dance outside until our lord Beelzebub calls upon us.
Now, if we rotate the throat circle back to the West Country... and you can see there'll be several gits of bad weather across most of the sky.
Some rain, but no more severe than soft porn
In summary, then - and that's all the weather.
Back to the war, and on the front line at Eastmanstown, our reporter Donald Bethl'hem.
Donald, what's the latest?
As I swilled the last traces of toothpaste from my mouth this morning a soldier's head flew past the window shouting the word "victory".
Seems to be a lot of action behind you there Have you seen any fighting yourself?
Today I saw the body of an old woman on the ground - she was lying in a pool of her own tomatoes
Thank you, Donald.
Earlier today, I've been down among the fighting myself.
This is my report.
There's something about the way these people move that tells you they are a nation at war.
Look into their eyes, and you can read the words,
"I have a reservation at the restaurant of death."
It's a messy bistro, with a bad name for soiling its customers' clothes.
We've seen only one napkin in four days.
People here are confused, spending most of their time running about like idiots.
Earlier today, we met a family, who thanks to this war, now have no home.
A war which they feel anyway has nothing to do with them.
(TRANSLATOR) This is not our war.
We are being forced to swallow the rotten egg of an angry political goose.
(CHRIS) That boy is now a war orphan.
One more victim of what they call here the "desert confetti".
I have a child about his age myself.
When I phoned him ten minutes ago, I told him to move out of the house to make room for his new brother.
Back live now, progress on The Day Today smart bomb
- Jonathan!
Get rid of Hurd!
Thanks!
Well, as you can see Chris, there's the missile, cruising at 2000 per second trying to locate the target the soldier it's aimed at
There's the soldier. it goes in through the mouth down through the oesophagus into the stomach, there's the explosion.
Absolutely bang!
That's The Day Today bringing you another tear on the face of the world's mother!
Alan!
Sport!
Thanks, Chris.
And now some late-night soccer results.
I'm Alan Partridge.
This is division two.
Richmond Arithmetic versus Nottingham Marjorie, match postponed due to bent pitch.
Goodnight.
Suzanna Gekkaloys has broken through to the front line.
This is her contribution to history.
This is the very heart of the conflict.
The men here have been fighting non-stop for three days.
We drove in at night, straight into the middle of a rocket battle.
The air now is thick with what they call here the "electric cornflakes".
We're under strict instructions not to leave the vehicle but to drive on through.
With no cover, we ran across open space to a nearby house.
We found an injured man.
We did our best.
There are always casualties in war.
There was a family sheltering in the back room.
We had no tongue in common, but through the universal language of mutual need I knew she was saying,
"Come, set your equipment up in our refuge The world must see this mess."
These brave people are now sleeping, but they know that tomorrow our aerials and transmitters could make this house a prime target.
Chris.
Back to the war now, and in the noise and heat of what they call here the "flying scissorbeans", there is no optimism - or at least wasn't until just two minutes ago when we received these pictures of a miracle from the front line
less than a mile from where I'm standing.
This was the scented rose in the bumgut of Satan.
For here at 7:13 precisely, the fighting stopped.
Soldiers, who moments earlier had been shooting each others' teeth out, put down their guns and joined in peaceful commune.
Some played games or, like these men, planned a musical.
The reason for this calm lay inside a shed.
for here, the massed forces of two world powers were unified by nothing more than the distress of a cat stuck on a high shelf.
No one knows how it got there, but these brave fighting men, moved by the simplicity of the animal's plight decided to forget their differences and try to get it down.
But even as the men celebrated, their heads were blown clean off... for somebody - nobody knows who - had filled the cat with nitro-glycerine.
"The Day Today" - news from telly to belly!
Just time for a quick look at tomorrow's headlines
"Plastic surgeon arrested with stash of stolen mouths." That's in the " Express".
"The Hull Aphrodite" - "Police chief crushes lizard with whistle." there he is looking wretched
The "Daily Mail" - "Child made of paint wins by-election."
The Murdoch papers tomorrow. " Crazed wolves in store a bad mistake admit Mothercare".
and there's the same story in the "Sun".
and the "Daily Mirror" have a special pull-out note for the milkman.
They'll doing three, two and four later in the week.
That's it, That's "The Day Today" on the day a man on this programme told how he was menaced by Hugh Sculley.
He just came in and went... then went out.
That's it.
Goodnight.

Coming up as stories in the programme peace talks collapse as Serbs strap 400 monkeys to the back of Owen's Volvo...
That does make it harder to reverse.
...and, "Leave us alone," say men from Saturn.
We want to go about our daily routines as far as is at all possible.
Buckingham Palace has announced that over 40 members of royal staff have been destroyed to save money.
The 43 workers learned of their fate after church on Sunday.
They met the Queen and were told they would be slaughtered with scythes.
That evening, they were herded into a Sandringham attic and culled in less than 10 minutes
It's not known who conducted the killings, but Princess Margaret is believed to have been involved.
She was overheard yesterday saying...
Conditions on board the train stuck on the line for two days in Hampshire have deteriorated dramatically.
There are fears now for the lives and sanity of those on board.
Ted Maul has that story reporting.
At first the concern was for the commuters stuck on a train because a signal got jammed by a dead bird.
But when farmer Peter Yates took them sandwiches this afternoon, the situation changed dramatically.
Two commuters jumped him like raptors and threw him aboard.
20 minutes later, he managed to get off the train and tried to escape but was lassoed by a man with a rope and pulped
Just over an hour after that, a naked Mr Yates appeared briefly for the last time, trying to haul himself out of a window, but it was a naff effort.
Most ominously, this evening, the commuters were seen struggling with a sack containing an object that was obviously as heavy as a human body and then throwing some kind of weird ritual.
Many here fear the worst, that Mr Yates has been killed and sacrificed by a group of ordinary men and women who less than two days ago were content to sit opposite each other in silence, yet today beat their chests and yell like savages.
Moments ago, we intercepted the sound of the guard trying to radio for help.
Get these people...
I There's a woman...
I (BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM)
Time now for sport with Alan Partridge.
Alan, I've got to say that that soccer commentary was brilliant last night.
- Thank you.
- It really was.
I mean, I'm not very interested in soccer but I was totally absorbed and entertained by the whole thing.
Great!
Take a bit of extra time if you want.
Do as much as you like on this, I'll be enjoying this too.
Tonight, we're going to look at self-defence...
Brilliant!
Now, self defence is no longer the preserve of hard men like Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin
More and more these days we all need to know how to get a bit handy.
Anyone who's been on public transport late at night will know that there are a lot of disturbed individuals out there.
One minute they could be babbling incoherently, the next they could be going for your person
What do you do?
Well, this week is national self defence week, so who better to tell us than one of Britain's best-loved judo fighting people,
Commonwealth silver medallist Adam Neils.
- Adam.
- Hi.
Now, self defence is not about simply punching someone repeatedly in the face until they're unconscious, is it?
No, it's exactly what it says - defending yourself.
Self-defence with the minimum of force.
- Weaponry?
- No, just your body.
That's all...
- Snooker ball in a sock?
- No, no.
- We teach people how to deal with that, but...
- What do you call those things, the two sticks with the chain between them?
- Nunchuka.
- Yeah, I like those.
Now, can we actually see some of the basics?
Can you talk me through
Right.
OK, Tanya?
Right, well, we teach people to deal with anything from a sort of general invasion of body space through to a specific attack...
So, if I was to go like this...
Hey!
No!
Ooh!
- (CHOKING) Tell her to s...
I can't breathe!
- She's now taken control away from you...
- I cannot breathe!
- Sorry.
She's wrested control away from you and has overcome you.
The aggression has been turned against you.
- (CROAKS) What happened if someone attacked you from behind?
- Right...if you were to attack me from behind-
- No!
- Right.
I throw you, I could throw you,
I could use an elbow block against you or I could shock you, immobilise you by just twisting the skin-
Get off!
Chris!
The American car company General Motors have today announced a cut in their workforce at their plant in Detroit.
Our economics correspondent, Peter O'Hanraha-hanrahan, is there at the moment.
- Peter, what's going on?
- Chris, it's a mass redundancy measure it's the biggest layoff in American industrial history 35,000 jobs in one fell swoop.
Gone!
- 35,000?
- Yes.
Peter, there's only 25,000 people at the plant!
That's right, Chris.
Mass redundancy on an unprecedented scale.
Would you mind telling me how the plant can function on minus 10,000 workers?
- I don't know.
You tell me.
- I'll tell you what, Peter.
You mean 35 hundred workers have been sacked.
No, 35 thousand.
It's all here.
Let me see what you've got down there.
- It's 35 hundred.
You're right.
I made a mistake.
- Peter, I want to see it.
I don't want to hear anything more out of your mouth, I don't believe it.
- Now show me your notes.
- No.
- Yes!
- It's 35 hundred.
Show me, I don't believe what you're saying.
I just want to see the numbers.
Now hold them up.
Hold them up and keep them up!
And rotate them 180 degrees in my favour!
Do it!
- Peter, What's that?
- I don't have a monitor, Chris.
I can't see what you are doing
You know what I'm talking about.
It's just above your right eye.
Yes.
A cobweb.
And how's a cobweb going to dig you out of your numerical mess?
I don't know.
Peter, You're lying in a news grave.
Do you know what's written on your headstone?
News.
Peter, thank you.
Peter O'Hanraha-hanrahan live in Detroit.
What... is a gay?
Now back to the stuck train.
One of the commuters, now no more than a bunch of wild savages, has given himself up.
Here's Ted Maul.
All afternoon, aggressive volleys of rubbish thwarted attempts to get the train moving again.
Barricaded into his engine, the driver has constantly to defend himself with tools.
Then, in a rare lull - perhaps the commuters were sleeping or praying to some new god - one of them left the train.
Gerard Hawt, a civil aviation engineer, had broken free from the train of hell, but it had left its mark.
The man was in no state to give an interview, but it was possible to extract the following information
The commuters are split into two factions, one led by a woman believed to be an insurance broker from Staines they wear blue ink on their heads - and a smaller group who worship fire.
They rallied round a grease-monkey from Acton.
With the signal here still jammed by the dead bird, there's only one hope now - that a police marksman can shoot it out, giving the driver a slim chance of making it to Liverpool Street before he's torn to pieces.
Time for travel now from Valerie Sinatra in the travel pod a mile above the centre of Great Britain.
Valerie, tell me about everything!
- I don't know about everything Chris
- I could teach you.
I do know that it's best to avoid this evening the A1(M) south of Newcastle.
There's a crash that's been going on for several weeks and so far it's involved 9000 vehicles so that's really deathsville.
Good news, however, for travellers on the M25.
Workers have finished cobbling that, so that's great.
The M6, however, in Liverpool is still at a standstill.
That's due to the mad cow hanging from a bridge.
The M50 is clogged again- that's not my fault - and the M11 is slow between junctions 5 and 6 due to some police escorting some birds to the coast
- That's about it, really.
- I don't know, It's like a Robertson's factory down there.
- Sorry?
- All the jam.
That's right!
Golly!
Gay desk now, from Colin Poppshed.
Thanks, Chris.
Quick roundup of today's gayness, now starting with the roads.
The M70 the A3, the B664 and the A48(M), they're all gay as from midnight tonight.
The gay elements are potassium, zinc, hydrogen, copper and argon.
Quick look at the world's walls, the Wailing Wall is gay, Hadrian's Wall is very gay, the Great Wall of China's not gay and the Old London Wall's also stopped being gay.
Gay cars next, they're the same as last night
All Volkswagens registered between 1982 and 1985 they stay gay for another fortnight.
And finally, the gay seas are the Caspian and the Mediterranean, so see you there.
- Chris.
- Thanks, Colin.
He's not gay, by the way.
We wouldn't employ a homosexual.
Offices.
We all know what they're like.
"Can I borrow a stapler, please?"
But many are undergoing radical restructuring through the work of Lester Beck of Events International.
His latest project was on the offices and people of Clubrox Pharmaceuticals in Windsor.
Yeah, we can ... as much as you want, Harry... (REPORTER) Anthony Ponn is Clubrox's office manager.
He and his sale staff are about to become part of a unique experiment in management training.
An experiment they shall never forget, and from which one of them will never physically recover.
(AMERICAN ACCENT) So what we must do is construct a raft, and onto the raft we will put ourselves...
Lester Beck is the author of a radical management system known as "disassemblage".
The disassemblage procedure relies on dismantling each employee's emotional make-up, and then reassembling it in a different order.
What are we?
Are we human?
Are we fully human or are we not human?
What does it mean to be not human?
We need to be human.
Hmm?
So, let's get it into the present, huh?
Let's kick some ass into life!
The team convene at 6am of the first day and are immediately disassembled.
You know that you often say "er" instead of speaking?
Did you know that?
- No.
- Has everyone else noticed this about Anthony?
- (ALL) Yes.
- Every time you say "er", we're going to remind you that you are saying "er" by going "er" as well.
OK?
Don't take it personally.
- Er, I...
- (ALL) Er!
- I'm the, er...
- Er!
- I'm the office manager, er...
- Er!
- I'm responsible for the, er...
- Er!
The...
I'm the office manager.
I'm re...
Er...
- Er!
- All right!
Stop it!
Stop it!
(LESTER) Good.
I want you to give Christine a gift, and the gift you're gonna give Christine is the gift of the truth of who she is to you.
John.
You dress like an old lady and you've got a stupid face.
Good.
Hit Christine.
- Christine, say thank you.
- Thank you.
Good.
Lisa.
You're hairy and you're lonely and you...
- Just two will do Lisa.
- You're hairy and you're lonely.
Hit Christine.
Good.
Anthony.
You've got no sense of humour and you're always there.
Christine, hit Anthony.
- Ow!
- Good.
Beck takes the team out into the field to test purchasing techniques.
OK, what we're going to do we're going to buy a newspaper,
OK, and this is where we're going to get what we want.
John.
Hello, my name's John.
I'd like a "Today" newspaper, please.
25?
Got the right change.
Thank you very much.
Good, John!
Anthony!
- Can I just ask?
- Buy a paper, Anthony!
- One thing, though...
- Buy a paper!
I don't know, because I've already bought one, you see, and I don't know if I should buy the same one or, er-
- That's not important for the exercise!
- (ALL) Er!
- Can I have, er?
- Er!
- Please stop it!
- Er!
Buy a paper!
Buy some candy!
I don't care!
I don't know!
I've got the "Mirror"!
I've got it!
I've got the "Mirror"!
Coming up
- Clinton welcomed home after machine-gunning 400 buffalo... and the seige on the stuck train has ended.
A police marksman shot the dead bird out of the signal at 7 o'clock this evening and the train, which had been stuck on the line for 57 hours, full of commuters going berzerk, pulled off in a cloud of burnt diesel.
By the time they arrived in London, most of the commuters had put their clothes back on and wiped off the blood.
More cuts in the NHS have been announced today.
Here with a resumé of its 30-year decline, Pheeona Haahlahm.
Few people would deny that were it one of its own patients, the NHS would be on the critical list.
What was once the healthy bouncing boy-child of Ernest Bevin is now barely more than a disease-wracked breathless corpse, but why?
In 1979, funding for the NHS stood at over 10 billion pounds.
But by the late '80s, government cuts left the service with 37% less cash.
So that's only 3% in real terms.
So what, in the end, will happen to this?
- Chris.
- Thank you, Pheeona.
I'm joined by the Junior Minister of Health, in our one- to-one discussion area, Matthew Krean.
Now, Mr Krean, you've taken the money out of the NHS, you're the man responsible here, what do you say?
I want, I want to say...
I want to discuss this report.
- Well, let's not discuss this report, let's discuss the figures
- No, we have to discuss the report, because this report is a tissue of lies!
- It is...
- Hang on a second, let's just stick to the figures, shall we?
- You're destroying the lives of patients, what do you say about that?
- No, I want to stick to this report!
- This report is a tissue of lies, it's completely jaundiced-
- What are you saying?
Lies?
Absolute lies!
It's nonsense from beginning to end!
Lies.
- How dare you say this!
- I want it to ...
I think this report is a perfect example of tabloid television-
I'm not prepared to listen to this.
I'm not having anymore of this I didn't come here for this.
I don't want to come back again.
(CHRIS CONTINUES MUTTERING)
(CHRIS) I'm off.
And I'm never coming back.
"The Day Today" - bagpiping fact into newsl
"Enviromation", from me, Rosy May.
The war raging between two nations of crabs in the Bay of Biscay has claimed more human lives.
Last night, a Portuguese trawler was dragged underwater by the turbulence of a massive battle between over 400 million crabs fighting for territory on the ocean floor.
Blinking.
In England, over 700 million hours a year are spent blinking.
That's why a Leeds firm has built a special light which switches itself off for the duration of each blink
The device is also triggered by other activities which don't require light such as sleeping and grieving.
I'm Rosy May and the world is at my teat.
Staying now with the world, but it's the human world this time which is around... the animal world and sometimes on top of it, making politics and events, rather than environment stuff, with "The Day Today" international news round-up.
Moscow.
Hello, Chris.
Here in Moscow, it's Russia's chronic nuclear waste problem that's dominating the news live this hour.
The latest plan is to hand out small parcels of plutonium waste to schoolchildren.
Nuclear experts visit schools and the children are taught songs celebrating the efficiency of atomic power.
(SINGS)
At the end od the day, the children queue up for their plutonium, which comes in a bag, bearing the instruction "Take this home and deal with it".
(CHRIS) Tokyol
Thanking you, live from Tokyo, where it's 3:30 in the morning.
That's minus 7 in new Japanese time.
In just seven hours, the first of 30 full-size duplicate Japans will be switched on, and all clocks will be reset to 00000.
The new Japans have been three years in construction, involving perfect replication of cities and people and children.
The raft of new countries, which extends over 5,000 miles into the Pacific, has been hidden until now, but was spotted yesterday from an aeroplane.
Japan has so far refused to comment.
(CHRIS) Romel
Live, thanks, from Rome, where the two French boys who hacked into the Vatican computers and changed Catholic doctrine are still being held by cardinals in Assisi.
In a sensational development today, a video showing Stefan and Jed Mandrot, bruised but alive, was broadcast on Italian television with Vatican approval.
(SPEAKS FRENCH)
The boys were snatched from the street two days ago and held in a turret after admitting they had tapped into the new Vatican theology bank, a computer which contains the full doctrine and law of the Catholic church
The Vatican realised the computer had been tampered with when they discovered Jesus had died of food poisoning in aged 19 and Lou Reed had been canonised as a saint.
And that's the way the world is today from Rome.
- From Tokyo.
- And from Moscow.
(ALL) Goodbye.
Chris.
Wrong, all of you!
Because Collately Sisters is doing the business, not me.
Thanks, Chris.
And there was a big whoop of dismay in the city today, Chris, when Troublefinch Duskyholdings chopped off an eighth at 2.44 after a disappointing gutter surge tomorrow.
Chris.
The Central Numerical Council issued the new seven today.
It'll be three kilos heavier than the old seven, and made of glass.
Chris.
Collately Sisters.
Spackhandy Choptubes up 2.4, but let's see how the pound did today with a quick look at the Currency Susan.
And as you can see it started off today quite healthily as a medium Susan, while the yen surged to a quite attractive, popular Susan, by close of trading with the mark resting on a plain, dumpy Susan with bad ears.
Chris.
Summary.
Business.
Chris.
Your complaints.
This is my complaint, right.
TV is the most unkinnin', unhappenin', unsucceeded piece o' sheet in the 'hood now.
You gotta get it, totally discount ya.
More in the area, see?
I'm talkin' more ragga, more boggle, more death metal and Belgian house.
You hear me?
Let's get TV bangin', mud the far cuss.
When I drive my car, I am not driving,
I am participating in a conspiracy called traffic.
I will walk.
Time now for the weather with Sylvester Stuart on the weather pinball.
Starting tonight in the southwest, where it should rain in drops the size of a wrestler.
But fortunately, most of the rain there not quite reaching the ground.
On now to Scotland and the north of England quite warm, about the temperature of a cow.
However, a very stupid area of low pressure, moving from the Midlands, will bring some heavy breezes later on, a bit like the first rush of euphoria induced by a large dose of heroin
On to the north-east, there'll be some heavy thunder there, about as loud as a woman.
The summary, then...
Cool-showers-wet, cool-showers-wet, cool-showers-wet...
- Time now for Alan Partridge - got some sport for us?
- Certainly have.
Great.
And just some late-night soccer results.
Here they are f... for division two.
Goodnight.
Your complaints.
This...this is my complaint, right?
TV is the most unkinking, unhappening unsussed piece o' sheet in the 'hood right now.
- Look at the lens.
- Oh, sorry.
You gotta get it.
Totally discount ya.
More in the area, see?
I'm talking more ragga, more boogle,
- more death... mental and...
- Death metal.
...death metal and Belgian house.
You hear me?
Let's get TV banging, mud far... mud the far cuss.
- And look at the camera again and nod your head as you say that.
- Mud the far cuss.
And say that again once more into the camera for the last bit
- Mud the far cuss.
- Thank you sir
Back now to The Day Today documentary on the efforts of Lester Beck to revamp the people and offices of Clubrox Chemicals in Windsor.
OK.
Let's make...
Day three, and Lester Beck places a powerful new variable in the office environment.
If we released a live pig into the office, how would you be able to cope?
Lisa?
What?
The pig that's... our anger?
No pig, a real pig.
What would happen?
Would you be able to cope?
Let's see.
OK.
Please release the pig!
- Release the pig, please!
- (LISA) Oh, no!
Is a pig!
OK, this is Snorkle.
Say hello to Snorkle the pig.
- Get involved with the pig!
- Who allowed this?
!
It's standard practice at Events International to intertextualise... (ANTHONY) This is my office!
- Get a knife!
- Shh!
- Get a knife!
Let's kill it!
- (ANTHONY) Stop it!
- Get a knife or something...
- This is my office!
Shh!
Anthony, wi?
And you.
- Stop shouting!
- It might have a baby!
- It will if you keep shouting.
- Listen to Christine, she's speaking sense here-
And you stop shouting. ple... and Please
Can we just?
Just let's put some paper down and keep it happy.
Come on!
Come on, pig!
(PHONE RINGS)
See, the pig doesn't care about you, but you care about the pig.
This is your problem.
Hello?
Um...
Um...
We're a bit... tied up at the moment.
C-Can it wait?
- (LESTER) Tell them about the pig.
- Well, we've got, er...
We've got, er...
- (ALL) Er!
- I'm sorry.
We've got a pig in the office.
A pig.
Yes, it is a real one.
Please continue that conversation...
Meanwhile, in training sessions, one employee, John Histons, questions Beck's techniques.
Let me ask you a question, when you go to the toilet, do you have an Armitage Shanks interface defecation scenario, or do you just have a shit?
Mommy's gone, and you want to cry like a baby.
You...
That's good, John.
Help him on to the carpet.
- Down you come.
- And John?
John?
I want you to Imagine that the carpet is your mother.
Beat up on your mom who left you!
Go on!
Get it out, John.
Go on!
- Go on!
Hit it!
Hit it John!
- Don't cheat on yourself.
- Imagine it's your mother!
Go on!
- It's your mother
- (JOHN) Why did you go?
- Kick it!
Go on!
Kick it!
She left you John.
She didn't understand that you were suffering.
and it's taken you 25 years to get over it but you're doing it now, John.
- That's good.
Beat up on the carpet!
- (LISA) Go on, John.
Don't give up!
- She's taken all the best years of my life...
- Christine, Christine, don't get too excited.
OK, let's look at next week, please...
Three months later, the office at Clubrox has been rationalised.
...tell him to ring back in five, please..
- em.. and the Egham account....
- I'll do it on the same day.
Lisa, now. the dry-calling in the Windsor area was very weak last week.
If you could really push it next week, that would be excellent.
- Yes, I can.
- Brilliant.
That's all.
For John Histons, the training course was his last memory of the company.
He left shortly after it to follow a new direction.
Well, a lot people very surprised when ended up in a butcher's, but... the office, well, it wasn't really me, you know?
But here I know... exactly what to do.
I like meat.
I like working with meat.
I'm happy with it.
In a way, I respect it more than people.
(INTERVIEWER) If you saw Lester Beck, how would you react?
Er...
I'd probably stab him with this knife.
"The Day Today" - news feltch!
And just time for a quick look at tomorrow's, er...
"The Independent" - " Bank of England recovers from swollen chairman unusualness."
The "Telegraph" go with, "Simon Rattle lost in cress."
The " Daily Mail" pretty keen on " Lassoed bat wins Booker." they devote four pages to that.
The "Daily Mirror" rather upset, "Fleetwood Mac buried in dog avalanche."
And "Today" ride with "Old woman killed by little glass planet."
that's a story there by Andrew Penman Due to a printing error tomorrow's "Guardian" is full of water.
That's it.
That's "The Day Today" on the day the world learned that Cliff Richard is pregnant.
Goodnight.
Stephanie.
That doesn't fit.
Helen.
Too mythological.
Daisy.
Daisies are yellow.
Does this look like a yellow car to you?
When you choose a name, it's got to be who you are.
It's got to represent the nature of the thing you're naming.
Don't you know that?
All right.
Big red boat car.
A little creativity would help here.
What difference does a name make?
"A rose by any other name would smell just as sweet," right?
Yeah, but the problem is, most people... think more about the name than the rose.
There's a rose in that man... but right now, something just plain stinks.

Oh, it's a... it's a disaster.
It's an utter disaster.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, Barbara, it's not your fault.
She just seemed so steady and reliable.
Let me see your phone book, quick.
Her references were impeccable, Barbara.
She did all those biggest parties last year, you know?
Polo club Christmas party, the big charity bazaar.
All of those.
Just seemed so nice, too.
Not at all the sort of person who'd just run off and leave you in the lurch while she goes somewhere and has appendicitis.
And I guess it's a new world, isn't it?
Here it is.
It's the Metropolitan.
I'm calling the Metropolitan.
I'm going to find out who did their... opening gala last month.
I don't think there's enough time.
(doorbell rings) Oh, I'll get that.
When are you going to get a butler?
Hello.
Well, why don't you just check your-your party-giving record-keeping office?
Well, never mind, never mind.
You have been very kind.
Thank you.
Though not very helpful.
Amelia, this is Monica.
Monica has been sent to replace our party coordinator.
Oh, marvelous.
Now you see, Barbara?
What did I tell you?
Never panic.
What is going to be will be... even if it never comes to pass.
That's what I always say.
Hello.
I'm Amelia
Beauthorpe Archibold.
Hello, Mrs. Archibold.
How are you?
(laughing)
Uh, has my daughter-in-law explained our situation?
Oh, yes.
I understand that you're hosting a very large function here.
Oh, functions, my dear, are held in church basements.
This is an event.
The Founders Club banquet is the highlight of the social season.
I had thought about having it back in here, or maybe out in there.
Um, I don't know.
The appendix lady was supposed to have decided that.
This year, my son,
Dr. Harrison Trowbridge Archibold IV, is the guest of honor... as well as the host-- a quaint but expensive custom.
To be a member, you have to donate something to the city:
um, a school, a library.
Uh, Harrison is donating a new children's wing to the hospital.
Oh, you must be very proud of him.
Always have been.
He is the jewel in my crown.
So, the, um, banquet is in...
Oh, it's in about two weeks.
Uh, I'm afraid I really don't know all the arrangements that have been made.
I've been awfully busy recently.
They're trying to have a baby.
The mama does test tubes, shots every day.
This conception is quite a business.
Amelia.
Well, Barbara, we're all girls here.
Monica, do you have any children?
No, no, I don't.
My late husband,
Harrison Trowbridge Archibold III, always said a man who dies without children is deader than a mackerel.
Or something like that.
Well, now, I thought about having a little cappuccino bar over here.
I had a cappuccino once.
And, uh, I had some thoughts about, uh, centerpieces-- something elegant and simple, maybe even kinetic.
Kinetic?
Yes, you know, little moving works of art right there in the middle of the table.
Barbara, you've got a half an hour.
You take a temp...?
Hello, Mother.
Harrison, uh, this is Monica.
Monica's going to help us with the Founders banquet.
Ah, well, good.
Have fun.
If you would excuse us, please.
Oh, certainly.
Take as long as you need.
Um... about those centerpieces.
It'll be done by this afternoon.
Thanks, Matt.
Hi.
MONICA:
Hello.
I hope you don't mind me dropping by.
They told me at the hospital I'd find you here.
I need some checks signed.
Oh.
No problem.
How's the banquet coming?
Oh, it's going great.
I thought I'd see for myself what the founder has founded.
It's going to be much bigger than I thought.
Yes, well, it is quite a fitting tribute to the family, isn't it?
Not to mention the children.
That too.
Beauthorpe Archibold Pavilion is going to be the most advanced children's emergency medical center in the entire country.
They'll have the best equipment, best research, best pediatric surgeons and diagnosticians in the world.
Starting with yourself?
Well...
My father used to bring me to this lot on Saturdays and pitch balls to me, and we used to... sit under that tree and talk, and I can always remember him saying,
"Those to whom much is given, much is expected,"
which is why I became a doctor, I think.
Despite the family money, or maybe because of it, he always wanted to give back something in return.
And so do you?
With privilege comes responsibility.
I'm an Archibold and a Beauthorpe, so that's twice the responsibility right there.
Um, see if I'm still making these monthly donations to this Child Watch thing... and, uh, you can renew my subscription toPediatric Journal.
(knocking)
Come in.
Barb.
Honey, I was just finishing up here.
I was on my way home.
Wh-What are you doing here?
I...
We're not, um...
Those shots didn't work.
I'm not pregnant... again.
It's okay.
There's always next month.
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh- shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.
We'll-we'll try again.
Oh, what's the use?
What's the use?
Barbara, Barbara...
listen to me.
It's just a matter of commitment and follow-through.
I don't think I can follow through anymore.
Honey, there's no one
I would rather follow through with than you.
(sighs) Hmm?
Barbara...
you're tired, honey.
You've been killing yourself with this Founders banquet.
It's going to be over in a couple of days.
You're going to feel better, okay?
Hmm?
Hmm?
Hmm?
And there's this darling little Thai restaurant over on Gaylord Street.
They fold their napkins in the shape of little white gardenias.
I just think it'd be perfectly lovely for my guests:
to have the napkins in the shape of little white gardenias.
Could you check that out, please?
And remember, nothing but the best.
Now, uh, what time are the caterers coming on Monday?
3:00.
Oh, don't you think that's a little late?
Well, uh...
Would you please call them and have them come at noon?
I-I'd be happy to.
Now, now, don't forget to turn the other cheek.
I'm running out of cheeks, Tess.
You know, I've been here two weeks, and all I've had to do is to order the perfect chairs, the perfect flowers, the perfect napkins.
Patience is a virtue.
Virtue is a grace.
Put them all together, and they make a happy face.
Tess, what am I doing here?
The Founders banquet is in two days.
Once it's over, then what?
I think that's what everybody in this house is asking themselves.
The people in this place have nothing to look forward to except the next big party or the next disappointment.
Maybe something less than their idea of perfect is exactly what this house needs.
I just had the most marvelous idea.
Now I wonder where she keeps that thing.
Oh.
You know, when I lived here, everything was in its logical place, very organized.
That is a Beauthorpe trait.
Mrs. Archibold, now that the party is so close,
I was wondering if I might take on an assistant.
No, you don't.
No way.
A-A-An assistant?
Mm-hmm, just for a couple of days.
Do you think it's necessary?
No, it is not necessary.
Yes, utterly, absolutely.
Well, um... whatever you want to do, Monica.
Oh, oh, here it is.
The sterling cake server from Harrison and Barbara's wedding.
(gasps)
Oh!
Oh!
This is Tess, my assistant.
Oh.
Uh, uh, Amelia Beauthorpe A-A-Archibold.
Beauthorpe, Beauthorpe.
Would that be the Beauthorpes of Charleston?
Yes.
Yes, yes, indeed.
Oh...
Carry on.
Hello.
May I help you?
Hi.
Is Archibold here?
Well, Mrs. Archibold is here.
Would you like to see her?
Yes, please.
Tell her that Manny Galinda is here.
It's very important.
Manny?
Yes.
Is that the doctor?
Mm-hmm.
Yes, it is.
Who's this?
Manny.
He's looking for you.
You Dr. Archibold?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Hi.
Manny.
Manny Galinda.
Manny.
Yes.
Manny Galinda.
Are you the paperboy or something?
Manny Galinda?
Who is this young man, Harrison?
Emanuel Galinda from Ecuador?
Si!
I come to visit my friend Archibold who send me $25 a month.
He's the boy we sponsor from Child Watch.
Si.
Long trip.
Can we get something to eat now?
Damn it.
The Child Watch offices are closed till Monday.
This is just absolutely amazing.
Do you all realize how far this child has had to travel?
Lenore Watkins and her daughter Jane, the debutante with the lazy eye, went to Buenos Aires last year.
She said it was a nightmare.
Mother, please.
We have some decisions to make.
Well, he can't just stay here.
Well, why not?
HARRISON:
Barbara, he's an illegal alien.
He's a child and he's just traveled thousands of miles to see you.
This is your fault.
You signed us up for this damn program.
He's thirsty.
Can you get him some milk?
Tell me something.
Um, how'd you get across the border?
Oh, I-I travel in car trunk.
I had blanket on me.
Very scary.
Lots of stops.
But whenever I got sad,
I just thought how happy I'd be to see Dr. Archibold.
Manny?
Does your mother know that you're here?
My mother's dead.
But it's okay.
It's better for me here.
Well, do you have any other family?
Anyone who will miss you?
No, I all alone.
Harrison, we have a responsibility to this child, even if it's just for a couple of days.
I still think we should call the police.
MONICA:
Dr. Archibold, please.
Can't you think this thing through?
I mean, if you call in the police, they'll be forced to bring in the authorities, and it seems such a shame to deport this wee boy just because he wanted to meet his benefactor.
Now, Harrison, I absolutely agree.
I don't even know this kid from Adam.
Well, I say he can stay.
At least until we can work things out.
Manny?
Oh, Harrison.
Now look at that.
The poor thing's just utterly exhausted.
He can stay until Monday.
I don't want you to think I approve of this.
Mann...?
Manny?
Barbara, he's gone!
(cooing)
(dove cooing, wings flapping)
Wow.
Whoa...!
(creaking)
Well, now what should we do?
Well, I just think we should consider ourselves extremely fortunate and let the whole thing go.
But he's a child.
Something bad could happen to him.
Barbara, he traveled the whole way from Ecuador by himself, in the trunk of a car.
(door opening)
I don't think we have to worry about him.
Now look, I want you to hear the top of my speech here.
"I come from a long line of men who value honesty..." (door closing)
Yoo-hoo!
Look who I ran into on the front doorstep.
"Decency and hard work.
A Beauthorpe family motto."
Harrison...
I'm really worried.
He's going to be fine, honey.
Listen.
"I grew up hearing..." Hola.
Oh, Manny.
Oh, thank goodness.
We thought you'd-you'd found another home to go to.
Great place you got here, Doc.
Oh, I'm glad you like it, Manny.
Well...
I have to get going.
Winthrop's always very punctual, and I have a 9:00 tee time.
I'll be home in time for supper.
Well, why don't you take the boy with you?
I'm, uh, I'm sure he'd love to see a golf course.
Sorry, but no room on the cart.
Harrison?
I would love to take him, darling, but the club has a very strict dress code.
I just happened to pick up some clothes this morning that might be very appropriate.
I love golf!
See?
He loves golf.
♪ I got a car... ♪
(screaming)
Slow down, Manny!
Watch the trees!
Manny!
Manny, no!
Manny... pull over there, please, and stop the cart.
♪ They gave me the keys... ♪
No, no, no!
Sandtrap!
(screaming)
Uh-oh.
HARRISON:
Oh, Manny!
Sorry.
I want you to sit right over there, and I don't want you to touch anything.
And don't speak to anybody.
It's going to take 'em weeks to drudge that lake, find Winthrop's $1,500 five-iron.
Sorry, Doc, it slip out of my hand.
I don't want to hear about it.
What's the matter?
You don't like kids?
Of course I like children... but there's a place for everything, Manny.
Do you want to have kids?
Yes.
It's okay if you want to practice with me.
Then I could be part of your club.
I'm sorry, son, but, uh... they don't allow children as members here.
Oh, not here.
The Super Warriors Club.
How'd you find out about that?
I saw it at the end of the slide.
Uh-huh.
You know, the, uh... the house that I live in, Manny, it was, uh... the house that I grew up in.
That club house used to be my secret place when I was 12.
My, uh...
My dad helped me build that.
He thought it'd help me make friends.
So, I can join it.
Then I can be your friend.
But the club disbanded a long time ago, Manny, and I-I-I grew up.
Oh.
And besides, there-there was only one member of that club, you know.
Not much of a club-- just one member.
So now you pay, and they have to let you in.
Yes, it's 555-3736.
I-I would appreciate it.
Thank you.
Oh, look at this.
Let me see here.
Oh, Monica.
Mm-mm!
Exquisite.
Absolutely stunning.
Thank you very much, Monica, thank you.
Oh, honey, I thought you-you took the day off.
No, honey, it's absolutely crazy around here, so I'm just going to go to the office for a couple hours.
I want to finish my speech, and then I'll come back in time to change, all right?
Honey, I bet Manny would love to see your office.
Barbara, I have to finish my speech.
Please, do it for me and the Founders banquet.
What is he going to do in my office all day except maybe destroy it?
Please?
All right, fine.
Hold up, hold up, pal.
You're coming with me.
Play with tongue depressors all day while I finish my speech.
(glass shattering)
Oh, please, not my stupid punchbowl.
MAN:
A dustpan?
Aw, Tess, those are lovely.
Not according to Miss Beauthorpe Archibold.
She says they're too pedestrian.
(phone ringing)
Hello?
Uh, no, I'm afraid she's not available at the moment.
Can I take a message?
You're calling from where?
Child Watch?
Well, are you sure?
Okay, thank you.
Manny Galinda is in Ecuador with his father, six brothers and sisters.
Then who is this little boy?
They don't seem to know who he is.
Things are starting to get interesting, huh?
I'm going to finish writing my speech, so you-you just sit down over there.
Occupy yourself with something.
Huh, this... is funny.
You look a lot smaller in this picture than you do in person.
Oh... that old picture.
I grow a lot.
Uh-huh.
When did you get this?
I mean, uh... what's this?
That's the model for the, uh, new children's pavilion.
They're building it over there.
So, here, new building.
We in old building?
Yeah, yeah.
This is, uh...
that's the old building, and they're going to tear down this old building when the new one's built, and, uh... this place is actually a disaster.
I think I go to bathroom.
Uh, don't you want to know where it is?
Uh, yeah.
Where bathroom?
Out the door, down the hall, first door on the right.
Thank you.
(phone ringing)
(buzzer blaring)
(buzzer blaring)
Dear God...
I know I should be patient, but they're going to tear this hospital down pretty soon, and...
I won't have a place to live... so you got to make this happen.
You got to make them want me.
Please, God, you have to make them want me.
Thank you.Gracias, Dios.
Archibold commitment to public...
Oh.
The, uh, Beauthorpe ideals of excellence and family honor...
So, excellence and family honor...
What's this?
That's a heart.
It's not shaped like a heart.
It's shaped like a heart.
It's just not shaped like a valentine.
Ideals of excellence and family honor...
No, no.
Ah.
Hey.
Whoa.
That's your heart, Manny.
It goes by itself?
I don't even think about it.
Yeah, that-that's right.
It's-it's, um... it's called an involuntary muscle.
You don't have to tell it when to go.
What tells it to stop?
Um...
I don't know.
I guess God.
God told my mom's heart to stop when I was a kid?
Well, sometimes hearts just get tired, Manny.
My heart gets tired every time I think of my mom.
Let me take a...
a listen to this heart, okay?
Manny, this is one of the best hearts
I've heard in a long time.
You're going to be just fine, hmm?
And if it's not in there, Howie, do whatever you have to do.
Okay, sure.
Oh, Lord, have mercy.
Help me.
Did you work out the centerpieces?
Oh.
Well, that's close.
Close?
Well, yes.
They're, uh... they're just not...
kinetic enough, busy.
You do know what I mean, don't you?
Look at it again.
Fish?
I didn't see those fish before.
Oh, I love that.
That's fabulous.
There you go.
(sighs):
Now I look like I belong here.
It takes more than a suit to belong somewhere...
Luis.
I know who you are.
You're not going to tell, are you?
No, you're going to.
I can't.
They'll make me leave.
Then where will I go?
I have to find a family for me.
But if you have to lie for it, Luis, it will never really be yours.
Let me tell you a secret.
I'm an angel.
I am... really.
Oh... don't be afraid.
God loves you, Luis... and He has heard your prayer.
You know, the one that you say at night before you ask Him to give your mother a kiss?
Dios.
He listens to me.
Now you have to do your part.
You must tell the Archibolds the truth.
God will take care of you.
I promise He will.
Uh, can you take one for me, Monica.
Sure.
Smile.
Hey...
There you go.
Thank you.
Dr. Ed, there's something I have to tell you.
Um, I like you very much.
Well, we like you, too, Manny.
Well, I-I hope you still like me... even when I'm not Manny.
What are you talking about?
Well... um... my name is Luis Peron.
(sighing):
I'm not from Ecuador.
I lied.
I'm sorry.
I just thought that you would maybe...
Maybe what?
Maybe be my family.
I don't believe this.
What is this, some kind of con game?
It's very impressive, Manny... or whatever your name is.
You really put one over on me.
I'm sorry.
Good, you should be.
You tell that to the police.
Because you and whoever put you up to this, have a lot of explaining to do.
Oh, Harrison, wait.
The boy hasn't hurt anyone.
And if you call the police, it's going to ruin the party.
She's right.
The last thing we need is scandal right before this banquet.
You better wait until later.
Who knows what that boy could steal by then.
If he was going to steal from us, he'd have done it, and be gone by now.
Let's wait till the night is over.
There's nothing that the boy wants except you.
You stay in your room till this is over;
then we'll deal with this.
Well, it's all up to Harrison now.
What do you think he's going to do?
I think if his heart has to battle against his family crest,
I'm afraid his family crest will win.
Snobs aren't born.
They're created.
I think it's time to put this family crest out of business.
I can't help but wonder if that's how it is with Manny.
Looking out at everybody living a life that you can't be a part of.
It's enough to make you do something desperate to have some of it for yourself, you know what I mean?
I know.
So when are you going to tell the truth?
What?
The truth.
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, I'm sure you do.
I know all about the Beauthorpes of Charleston.
All your life you've wanted to be a part of something as much as that little boy upstairs.
Well, this is your chance.
You can have the real thing.
If there was ever a time that you needed to open your mouth, it's now, Miss Lady.
Well, what would you rather be:
a Beauthorpe... or a mother?
There's something I want to tell you.
This may not be the best time, but I do want you to know, before you make any decisions concerning Manny.
His name is not Manny.
But does that really matter?
He's still a little boy without a family.
What are you suggesting?
Well, I'm just saying that maybe families are what you make them.
Well, that sounds a little revolutionary coming from a Beauthorpe.
I never thought I'd be saying this.
You see...
I'm not a Beauthorpe.
What?
Beauthorpe is a little shrimp port down on the Gulf.
I don't actually come from any family to speak of.
You're not a...?
I'm not a...?
I was 18, Harrison, and I was working as a waitress down in Charleston, and... oh, I was aching to get out of there.
So I saved up my money and I bought myself a fancy ball gown and a ticket up North.
Well, I crashed a lot of parties.
Then I finally met Harrison Archibold.
I told him my story about the Beauthorpes, the lost family fortune.
He fell in love with me.
Then I got my dream.
And the lie that came with it.
What is your name?
Amy Klump.
I'm a Clump?
With a "K."
I'm half Klump, half Archibold.
That's something else we need to talk about.
(gulps)
Do you remember when you were a little boy, remember that nice man out at the country club?
He used to give you rides on his big lawn mower?
Mr. Rojas, the gardener?
Director of Landscape Operations.
Well, he was he was very kind to me... during a period of difficulty with my marriage.
Oh, my God.
I'm the son of an Argentinean gardener?
A fine man.
Not an ounce of pretense about him, and a brilliant musician.
I'm not a Beauthorpe Archibold?
Did Dad, did Dad know about this?
I think he suspected.
Of course he never said anything.
Well, aside from the occasional reference to your, um... exotic coloration.
I don't believe this.
Harrison!
Oh, please, don't be angry with me.
Now, I know
I've made some terrible mistakes in my life.
I know that, but they were my mistakes, not yours.
I only told you this because I want to help.
Help?
Are you crazy?
You have just ruined my life.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sure I don't have to introduce the host of today's festivities.
A renowned physician and a generous benefactor,
Harrison Trowbridge Archibold IV.
Good afternoon.
I stand today as a new member of the Founders Club, proud and honored to carry on its worthy traditions.
I come from a long line... of Archibolds and Beauthorpes.
I grew up hearing the family tales of my mother's father,
Colonel Alden Kittering Beauthorpe, and his tremendous generosity.
The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, that this donation is not about the Archibolds or the Beauthorpes.
It's about my giving something back to the community.
Originally the new wing of the hospital was to have been called
"The Beauthorpe Archibold Children's Pavilion."
But this facility has absolutely nothing to do with the past.
It has to do with the future.
And for that reason, it is my desire to simply call this facility
"The Children's Pavilion,"
because that is who it will truly benefit.
Thank you.
Harrison, I have a message for you.
Monica.
Uh, why don't you just leave it by the phone,
I'll return it later.
No, I have a message from God.
From God?
Uh, why don't you just let me call you a taxi?
(gasps)
Don't be afraid.
I'm an angel.
What does, what does he have to say?
God?
Well, he says, "Big deal."
So your name isn't Harrison Trowbridge Archibold IV.
Big deal.
God loves you and he knows who you are no matter what your name is.
I've been living my life as a lie.
Why?
Would you have done anything different if your name had been Rojas?
Would you have been any less of a person?
Would you have loved Barbara less?
Harrison, who you are is not your name or your family.
Who you are is more essential than that.
It comes from God.
And what you make of yourself, that is what you give back to God.
Maybe God knows who I am, but...
I have something for you.
This is a family.
Not people who share a name or a lineage or a background.
But people who belong together because they love each other.
Oh, Harrison, don't let that slip away.
Manny?
I didn't tell you you could come in.
Sorry.
Can I come in?
Yeah.
You live here?
Mm-hmm.
How come you live in a hospital?
Well, it was the last place I ever saw my mom.
She was pretty sick.
We came here.
We waited and waited.
I mean, I tried to help her, but...
Her heart stopped.
Then they told me to wait in the room.
Then I heard them calling the police.
I knew they were going to take me away.
The only thing I ever had was my mama.
It was cold outside so I just ran down the stairs.
This is where I ended up.
How is it here?
Not bad.
If that's so, how come you pretended to be Manny?
I wanted to be a doctor.
I mean, at night I'd go into doctor's offices, learn.
I like your office the best.
It's the biggest.
The leather's real.
One day I found a letter from Manny.
I thought if you liked me, I could be a doctor.
I also needed a family.
But I guess it was a dumb idea.
Wanting a family is a great idea.
I know a lot of people would give anything for that.
How...
How would you like to be in mine?
I've never really liked that picture of the Colonel.
Oh, that's too bad.
Because I got such a good deal on him at that garage sale.
Oh.
Honey, thank you for calling.
Mom.
Oh, I was so worried about you, Manny.
Luis.
I'm okay now.
Yeah, we both had a lot of thinking to do.
Yeah, we did a lot of thinking.
Well, you want to know what I think?
I think...
I don't care what your name is.
I love you.
What do you think about that?
Well, I think that we should call a lawyer in the morning, and figure out a way to make a family.
(chuckles)
The First.
Huh?
Yeah.
Now we have to learn the secret handshake, okay?
If you were the only member, who else did you do the secret handshake with?
Well, I've been waiting a long time for this.
So here we go.
Ready?
One, two, two, three.
three.
Ah!
Ah!
Good.
All right, ready?
Yeah!
Good.
Good.
Now, of course, we have the clubhouse song.
Oh, boy.
Okay, ready?
Now, follow me.
BOTH:
♪ Stars of the summer night ♪
♪ Far down yon azure gleam... ♪
Tess, I've been thinking and I have the perfect name for the car.
Well, lay it on me.
The car.
"The car..."
I like that.
It's real and honest.
The car.
Sold.
(chuckles)
(both laugh)
In the Milky Way galaxy, circling the star called the sun is a small planet inhabited by intelligent life.
Earthlings have always been curious creatures.
Even as we discovered our own world, we dreamed of exploring others.
Perhaps other beings inhabit planets around distant stars.
If they are sending signals we could detect them with this powerful radio telescope and maybe send a signal back across the cosmos.
But might we ourselves leave our home on Earth to explore new worlds?
We have already taken the first small steps outside our planet.
We designed this shuttlecraft to carry people and cargo up into orbit.
Here, far above the Earth's atmosphere we're learning how to live and work in space.
You 've got go to maneuver the orbiter.
It's doing a nose sweep, going towards the starboard side.
The exterior shows just a little of the expected wear and tear of many trips back and forth.
The shuttle is equipped with a robotic arm to move large payloads ferried up from Earth.
It has lifted from the cargo bay a spacecraft which carries a German telescope named ORFEUS and a remotely operated lMAX camera.
Through its lens, we are seeing as never before the exterior of the shuttle as it orbits the Earth.
Now the ORFEUS telescope has been released into orbit.
We are riding with it, floating free in space.
Beneath us the shuttle pulls away, its cargo bay empty.
ORFEUS will spend several days observing the hottest and coldest gases in our galaxy.
Then the shuttle will take it back to Earth.
Over three decades, we've learned how to travel back and forth to space and live in low Earth orbit.
Now that we have taken these first steps, are we ready to cross the great black void to explore our solar system?
The journey will be hundreds of times farther than any we have undertaken.
First, we need to understand how we adapt to weightlessness.
Connected by tunnel to the crew cabin, a laboratory known as SPACELAB is carried in the cargo bay on certain flights.
Inside it, scientists are performing experiments developed by 13 different countries.
Two medical doctors, Norm Thagard and Roberta Bondar, a Canadian, study how our sensory systems behave when introduced to microgravity.
More than half the astronauts have space motion sickness at first.
German payload specialist Ulf Merbold is conducting an experiment to find out more about how it happens.
The subject sees one thing, but he feels another.
His brain is confused by these conflicting messages and he becomes disoriented.
Is the spacecraft rotating or are we?
While Roberta spins, a tiny camera inside her helmet is recording the movements of her eye as it reacts to the motion.
Data are collected at mid-flight, then again near its end.
When results are compared it's clear that the more time people spend in space the more they rely on the visual sense alone for orientation.
But these results tell us only about how we adapt in the short-term.
To find out how we're affected by longer stays people must live continuously in a space station.
There we could learn how to maintain a closed life-support system for months or years at a time.
Recycling is a must.
Future astronauts will be accomplished gardeners.
They will tend small farms in space like this hydroponic garden at the Kennedy Space Center that uses recycled water and oxygen to grow food.
The plants must be kept free of contamination.
Halfway to another planet, a crop failure would be a disaster.
Keeping fit is another challenge.
With no body weight to support, our muscles get weaker.
Bones become brittle.
The longer we stay, the worse the problems become.
People traveling to other planets will spend years in a very confined space.
What kinds of emotional stress will we face?
Will we get homesick, so far from everything we know isolated from family and friends and the familiar comforts of home?
Our first journeys to another world were to our nearby moon.
But those roundtrips took barely a week.
Today on the MIR station Russian cosmonauts live in space for many months.
From time to time, new crews arrive from Earth in the Soyuz craft.
Now, after almost a year in orbit the cosmonauts will return home in Soyuz.
Even though they've spent up to six hours exercising each day when re-exposed to Earth's gravity, they're temporarily unable to stand.
Imagine arriving on an alien planet in this condition.
But what if we could produce an artificial gravity as we travel to our destination?
In 1968, Stanley Kubrick's classic film 2001, A Space Odyssey featured spaceship designs which would allow us to do this.
As the ship spins around, anyone inside feels an outward or centrifugal force that acts like gravity.
In another design, parts of the ship spin around a stationary hub.
But the rotation of a small spacecraft could make occupants disoriented or sick.
We could avoid this if we built a spacecraft large enough and with a slower spin.
But it would have to be about as long as the Golden Gate Bridge.
How could we build such a large ship in space?
To get to Mars, for instance, we might design a spacecraft with two modules.
One attached to each end of a very long cable, or tether.
Once underway, the tether would be extended to separate the two modules.
The whole assembly, rotating about once per minute could provide the synthetic gravity needed.
But until recently, tethers were merely an elegant idea.
The concept would have to be tested.
So an experiment was flown on the space shuttle.
An Italian satellite was deployed on a very long tether.
The crew was then to retrieve it.
At first, the tether behaved exactly as predicted.
But then the reel jammed and the tether went slack.
By firing jets on both the orbiter and the satellite the crew learned that they could tighten it once again showing that we can control tethers in space.
Unexpected snags are bound to arise.
But we learn from them and keep moving forward.
To build more reliable spacecraft, we need light but tough materials.
To test them, in 1984 we launched a satellite with dozens of materials attached to its surface exposing them to the wear and tear of space.
We left it in orbit for 6 years, long enough for an interplanetary trip.
The shuttle retrieved it and took it back to Earth.
We found a wealth of information embedded in these panels.
As the microscopes reveal the vacuum of space is anything but empty.
A continuous bombardment of micrometeorites pitted the surfaces with craters.
But the most serious hazard in space is radiation.
The shuttle is suspended over the Earth's horizon.
We see only the lights of its cargo bay in the darkness.
But we can't see the harmful cosmic radiation that is everywhere here.
High-energy-charged particles stream out from the sun and other stars.
On Earth, we're protected by the atmosphere and the surrounding magnetic field.
In space, the radiation can penetrate the walls of our craft.
A Japanese x-ray satellite reveals vast clouds of radiation erupting from the sun.
On interplanetary trips we'll retreat to heavily shielded onboard shelters when solar storms are sighted.
Most planets are too hostile for people to visit.
But that doesn't stop us from exploring them.
Where humans cannot safely go we send remotely-controlled robot explorers.
Commanding them from Earth we use their electronic eyes and sensors to explore alien landscape.
In 1989, the Galileo spacecraft began a five-year journey to Jupiter the largest planet in our solar system.
Galileo dissolves out into nothingness as it goes into the darkness of space.
And that's the last we saw of it.
Early images of Jupiter were sent back to Earth in 1979 by two robot probes named Voyager.
This was our first opportunity to marvel at its Great Red Spot three times the size of Earth.
Life's molecular building blocks may be swirling within Jupiter's turbulent atmosphere.
If Galileo 's probe confirms this we should gain new insights into the origins of life.
Though it is our nearest planetary neighbor, Venus was always a mystery.
Thick cloud layers blocked our view of its surface.
Then we sent a spacecraft named Magellan to orbit the planet.
Its radar eyes could see through the clouds.
Magellan collected so much data that we can now explore the surface as if we were actually there.
We begin 60,000 feet up.
To help scientists recognize its features a computer exaggerated the height of the terrain ten times.
Perhaps these pancake domes were caused by lava pushing through weak spots in the surface.
These craters, some the size of Connecticut were made by collisions with comets and asteroids.
On Earth, ancient craters like these have been eroded by wind and water.
But there is little wind and no water here.
Venus swelters beneath a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide which acts like a greenhouse:
It allows sunlight to filter in, but then traps the heat inside.
The surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead.
In the distance, the great Gula Mons volcano.
We are now soaring more than 250,000 feet above the surface.
The long, smooth strips that now and then cross our path are small portions of the surface that Magellan 's radar did not scan.
Magellan has shown us the fantastic surface of an alien planet where no human could ever hope to land.
But there is another world in our solar system that people can visit.
Future generations of explorers will walk upon Mars.
To prepare the way for them, we could send a robot like this to scout a landing site.
We might dispatch a whole flock of these helpers to explore the terrain.
Unlike us, they are almost immune to radiation and need no air or water.
And they never get homesick.
Robots, like this Russian Mars rover being tested in Death Valley, California have been programmed for difficult tasks like negotiating rugged terrain.
More elaborate versions could help us construct a Mars base.
But operating them will be a challenge.
At the speed of light, a single command takes up to 20 minutes to travel from Earth to Mars.
If there is or has been life somewhere else in the solar system Mars is a good place to look for traces.
A great rift valley splits open the Martian plain.
It is as long as the entire United States.
We are now descending from 40,000 feet into a part of the valley known as Candor Chasma.
It is five times deeper than the Earth's Grand Canyon.
The height of the terrain has not been exaggerated.
This is how it really looks.
Life as we know it must have liquid water to develop.
Water may have flowed through these canyons long ago.
Perhaps it nourished life.
Fossil life forms may lie exposed on the floor of these canyons.
If we find any, it would be our first proof that life has existed beyond Earth.
It would mean that life probably is abundant in our galaxy and awaiting discovery in the universe beyond.
Today, Mars is a frozen world.
The average temperature here is lower than at the South Pole.
But long ago, when water may have flowed here it must have been warmer.
We don't know why Mars turned so cold but perhaps it could be made to change once again.
Could future generations somehow transform Mars into an Earth-like world where people could live?
To do it, we might imagine somehow raising the temperature to build up the atmosphere and melt the ice caps.
This would create lakes and rivers.
Then we could introduce plants to fill the air with oxygen.
Animals and people could now breathe the air.
A new world might be ready for us to colonize.
What would life be like on Mars?
Perhaps we could build farms and cities.
Or perhaps we will leave Mars as we found it.
Those decisions will be made by our descendants.
If terraforming is possible, it would take thousands of years.
By then, we may have left our solar system to explore the stars beyond.
Though it would take 100,000 years to reach them with present technology future generations may travel faster.
For the present, we must use telescopes to explore the stars.
Now, we are about to launch into space an instrument that will allow us to look far into the universe and back in time, almost to its birth.
This is the Hubble Space Telescope.
Once in orbit above the shimmer of the atmosphere it will see 10 times farther than telescopes on the ground.
Astronauts Kathy Sullivan, Loren Shriver and Bruce McCandless have come here to the Lockheed Vehicle Assembly facility for a final inspection.
Loved ones gather for the launch at the Kennedy Space Center.
Among them is Dr. Lyman Spitzer who first proposed the idea for a space telescope in 1946.
This is a tremendous milestone today for me.
Very exciting, very exciting.
I suggested a telescope of this nature would be very helpful to astronomy.
The idea finally took hold among astronomers and then among other people.
Finally, even in Congress.
Off it goes.
T-minus 10, go for main engine start.
We are go for main engine start.
Five, four, three, two, one....
And liftoff of the space shuttle Discovery.
Once Hubble is deployed astronomers will be able to direct its eye to any region of the universe they wish to observe.
While pilot Charlie Bolden, at left, maintains the shuttle's position astronomer Steve Hawley prepares for the deployment.
Discovery, go for Hubble release.
Hawley releases the telescope.
Then very slowly and carefully retracts the arm.
The sky and sea of Earth, reflected in its door the Hubble Space T elescope the creation of 10,000 people, is launched at last.
It will remain here for many years, sending images back to Earth.
Shuttle crews will visit Hubble on regular service calls to replace and upgrade its parts.
Yeah, it looks good.
I don't see any motion at all in there.
Hubble is open for business.
I wish you guys had been here.
You'll never believe it.
Superb is an understatement.
The telescope would reveal objects in detail never before seen.
But there was a problem.
A flaw was found in the shape of the telescope's primary mirror.
A repair would be necessary.
As part of the regular service another crew would make the repairs three years later.
First, the crew would have to recapture the telescope.
Houston, Endeavour, the right solar array, as we can see one side of it is bent way over.
Clearly we have a dynamic situation.
There's a problem with one of the solar panels that provide power to the telescope.
Looks like the outer bi-stem has a kink in it and is twisted 90-plus degrees clockwise there at the kink.
Once the telescope is secured in the cargo bay the astronauts will move outside for a close inspection.
So begins the most ambitious and difficult service mission ever attempted.
Story Musgrave and astronomer Jeff Hoffman are both veteran spacewalkers.
They'll depressurize here in the airlock then go to work.
The crew planned to replace the solar panels as part of the regular service.
But now, the twisted panel cannot be safely stowed in the cargo bay.
They have no choice but to throw it overboard.
Mission Specialist Kathy Thornton will do it.
A large object floating in space can pose a hazard to other spacecrafts.
So bursts from the jets are fired directly at the panel to make it spin.
Motion will speed its descent to the atmosphere where it will burn up.
Now, work on the telescope can resume.
Okay, coming straight on up.
Looking good.
I'm gonna let go.
Okay, take me away.
Come right on up easy, just like that.
Bring the forward up a little.
It's difficult to maneuver bodies and equipment unassisted.
The repair of the telescope would be impossible without the shuttle's arm.
It is controlled by Swiss astronaut, Claude Nicollier while Ken Bowersox, the pilot, acts as lookout.
The wide-field planetary camera will tell us about the size of the universe and how rapidly it is expanding.
The crew lifts it up with great care.
The tiniest bump could damage its delicate parts.
The astronaut teams alternate each day spending up to six hours in the cold vacuum outside.
All their tools must be tethered to keep them from floating into space.
After five days of intensive work and dazzling accomplishments the astronauts will install the corrective optics package.
It's a kind of contact lens designed to bring Hubble's giant eye into focus.
If it succeeds we will be able to look back to the edge of time.
The service and repair are now complete.
The mission drew upon skills we've learned throughout three decades of work in space.
Whether repairing a telescope, assembling a space station or building a base on a far planet we must rely upon the teamwork of humans and machines if we are to succeed in this new environment away from Earth.
You 've got a go for release.
The Cape of Good Hope beneath it the space telescope is now poised to begin a new era of exploration.
One astonishing discovery is a first look at an enormous and very unstable star we call Eta Carinae.
Four-million times more luminous than our sun its last outburst was seen in 1841.
Now Hubble reveals that it has blown two massive clouds into space.
The clouds contain the heavy elements essential for the creation of life.
In the heart of the Orion Nebula Hubble reveals a stellar nursery.
Gas and dust are condensing here to create new stars.
And even more astounding new planets are being born.
Never before seen, the dark material appears to be a new solar system forming around a young sun.
Hubble has now provided evidence that planets are common in the universe.
Life may be widespread among them.
Perhaps we will hear a signal.
Our curiosity and our need to progress to explore our solar system our galaxy, and the universe beyond.
The distances are vast, the voyage hazardous the destination daunting.
Still, we choose to explore.
What we discover...
is a small planet inhabited by intelligent life.
Earthlings have always been curious creatures.
Even as we discovered our own world, we dreamed of exploring others.
Perhaps other beings inhabit planets around distant stars.
If they are sending signals we could detect them with this powerful radio telescope and maybe send a signal back across the cosmos.
But might we ourselves leave our home on Earth to explore new worlds?
We have already taken the first small steps outside our planet.
We designed this shuttlecraft to carry people and cargo up into orbit.
Here, far above the Earth's atmosphere we're learning how to live and work in space.
You 've got go to maneuver the orbiter.
It's doing a nose sweep, going towards the starboard side.
The exterior shows just a little of the expected wear and tear of many trips back and forth.
The shuttle is equipped with a robotic arm to move large payloads ferried up from Earth.
It has lifted from the cargo bay a spacecraft which carries a German telescope named ORFEUS and a remotely operated lMAX camera.
Through its lens, we are seeing as never before the exterior of the shuttle as it orbits the Earth.
Now the ORFEUS telescope has been released into orbit.
We are riding with it, floating free in space.
Beneath us the shuttle pulls away, its cargo bay empty.
ORFEUS will spend several days observing the hottest and coldest gases in our galaxy.
Then the shuttle will take it back to Earth.
Over three decades, we've learned how to travel back and forth to space and live in low Earth orbit.
Now that we have taken these first steps, are we ready to cross the great black void to explore our solar system?
The journey will be hundreds of times farther than any we have undertaken.
First, we need to understand how we adapt to weightlessness.
Connected by tunnel to the crew cabin, a laboratory known as SPACELAB is carried in the cargo bay on certain flights.
Inside it, scientists are performing experiments developed by 13 different countries.
Two medical doctors, Norm Thagard and Roberta Bondar, a Canadian, study how our sensory systems behave when introduced to microgravity.
More than half the astronauts have space motion sickness at first.
German payload specialist Ulf Merbold is conducting an experiment to find out more about how it happens.
The subject sees one thing, but he feels another.
His brain is confused by these conflicting messages and he becomes disoriented.
Is the spacecraft rotating or are we?
While Roberta spins, a tiny camera inside her helmet is recording the movements of her eye as it reacts to the motion.
Data are collected at mid-flight, then again near its end.
When results are compared it's clear that the more time people spend in space the more they rely on the visual sense alone for orientation.
But these results tell us only about how we adapt in the short-term.
To find out how we're affected by longer stays people must live continuously in a space station.
There we could learn how to maintain a closed life-support system for months or years at a time.
Recycling is a must.
Future astronauts will be accomplished gardeners.
They will tend small farms in space like this hydroponic garden at the Kennedy Space Center that uses recycled water and oxygen to grow food.
The plants must be kept free of contamination.
Halfway to another planet, a crop failure would be a disaster.
Keeping fit is another challenge.
With no body weight to support, our muscles get weaker.
Bones become brittle.
The longer we stay, the worse the problems become.
People traveling to other planets will spend years in a very confined space.
What kinds of emotional stress will we face?
Will we get homesick, so far from everything we know isolated from family and friends and the familiar comforts of home?
Our first journeys to another world were to our nearby moon.
But those roundtrips took barely a week.
Today on the MIR station Russian cosmonauts live in space for many months.
From time to time, new crews arrive from Earth in the Soyuz craft.
Now, after almost a year in orbit the cosmonauts will return home in Soyuz.
Even though they've spent up to six hours exercising each day when re-exposed to Earth's gravity, they're temporarily unable to stand.
Imagine arriving on an alien planet in this condition.
But what if we could produce an artificial gravity as we travel to our destination?
In 1968, Stanley Kubrick's classic film 2001, A Space Odyssey featured spaceship designs which would allow us to do this.
As the ship spins around, anyone inside feels an outward or centrifugal force that acts like gravity.
In another design, parts of the ship spin around a stationary hub.
But the rotation of a small spacecraft could make occupants disoriented or sick.
We could avoid this if we built a spacecraft large enough and with a slower spin.
But it would have to be about as long as the Golden Gate Bridge.
How could we build such a large ship in space?
To get to Mars, for instance, we might design a spacecraft with two modules.
One attached to each end of a very long cable, or tether.
Once underway, the tether would be extended to separate the two modules.
The whole assembly, rotating about once per minute could provide the synthetic gravity needed.
But until recently, tethers were merely an elegant idea.
The concept would have to be tested.
So an experiment was flown on the space shuttle.
An Italian satellite was deployed on a very long tether.
The crew was then to retrieve it.
At first, the tether behaved exactly as predicted.
But then the reel jammed and the tether went slack.
By firing jets on both the orbiter and the satellite the crew learned that they could tighten it once again showing that we can control tethers in space.
Unexpected snags are bound to arise.
But we learn from them and keep moving forward.
To build more reliable spacecraft, we need light but tough materials.
To test them, in 1984 we launched a satellite with dozens of materials attached to its surface exposing them to the wear and tear of space.
We left it in orbit for 6 years, long enough for an interplanetary trip.
The shuttle retrieved it and took it back to Earth.
We found a wealth of information embedded in these panels.
As the microscopes reveal the vacuum of space is anything but empty.
A continuous bombardment of micrometeorites pitted the surfaces with craters.
But the most serious hazard in space is radiation.
The shuttle is suspended over the Earth's horizon.
We see only the lights of its cargo bay in the darkness.
But we can't see the harmful cosmic radiation that is everywhere here.
High-energy-charged particles stream out from the sun and other stars.
On Earth, we're protected by the atmosphere and the surrounding magnetic field.
In space, the radiation can penetrate the walls of our craft.
A Japanese x-ray satellite reveals vast clouds of radiation erupting from the sun.
On interplanetary trips we'll retreat to heavily shielded onboard shelters when solar storms are sighted.
Most planets are too hostile for people to visit.
But that doesn't stop us from exploring them.
Where humans cannot safely go we send remotely-controlled robot explorers.
Commanding them from Earth we use their electronic eyes and sensors to explore alien landscape.
In 1989, the Galileo spacecraft began a five-year journey to Jupiter the largest planet in our solar system.
Galileo dissolves out into nothingness as it goes into the darkness of space.
And that's the last we saw of it.
Early images of Jupiter were sent back to Earth in 1979 by two robot probes named Voyager.
This was our first opportunity to marvel at its Great Red Spot three times the size of Earth.
Life's molecular building blocks may be swirling within Jupiter's turbulent atmosphere.
If Galileo 's probe confirms this we should gain new insights into the origins of life.
Though it is our nearest planetary neighbor, Venus was always a mystery.
Thick cloud layers blocked our view of its surface.
Then we sent a spacecraft named Magellan to orbit the planet.
Its radar eyes could see through the clouds.
Magellan collected so much data that we can now explore the surface as if we were actually there.
We begin 60,000 feet up.
To help scientists recognize its features a computer exaggerated the height of the terrain ten times.
Perhaps these pancake domes were caused by lava pushing through weak spots in the surface.
These craters, some the size of Connecticut were made by collisions with comets and asteroids.
On Earth, ancient craters like these have been eroded by wind and water.
But there is little wind and no water here.
Venus swelters beneath a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide which acts like a greenhouse:
It allows sunlight to filter in, but then traps the heat inside.
The surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead.
In the distance, the great Gula Mons volcano.
We are now soaring more than 250,000 feet above the surface.
The long, smooth strips that now and then cross our path are small portions of the surface that Magellan 's radar did not scan.
Magellan has shown us the fantastic surface of an alien planet where no human could ever hope to land.
But there is another world in our solar system that people can visit.
Future generations of explorers will walk upon Mars.
To prepare the way for them, we could send a robot like this to scout a landing site.
We might dispatch a whole flock of these helpers to explore the terrain.
Unlike us, they are almost immune to radiation and need no air or water.
And they never get homesick.
Robots, like this Russian Mars rover being tested in Death Valley, California have been programmed for difficult tasks like negotiating rugged terrain.
More elaborate versions could help us construct a Mars base.
But operating them will be a challenge.
At the speed of light, a single command takes up to 20 minutes to travel from Earth to Mars.
If there is or has been life somewhere else in the solar system Mars is a good place to look for traces.
A great rift valley splits open the Martian plain.
It is as long as the entire United States.
We are now descending from 40,000 feet into a part of the valley known as Candor Chasma.
It is five times deeper than the Earth's Grand Canyon.
The height of the terrain has not been exaggerated.
This is how it really looks.
Life as we know it must have liquid water to develop.
Water may have flowed through these canyons long ago.
Perhaps it nourished life.
Fossil life forms may lie exposed on the floor of these canyons.
If we find any, it would be our first proof that life has existed beyond Earth.
It would mean that life probably is abundant in our galaxy and awaiting discovery in the universe beyond.
Today, Mars is a frozen world.
The average temperature here is lower than at the South Pole.
But long ago, when water may have flowed here it must have been warmer.
We don't know why Mars turned so cold but perhaps it could be made to change once again.
Could future generations somehow transform Mars into an Earth-like world where people could live?
To do it, we might imagine somehow raising the temperature to build up the atmosphere and melt the ice caps.
This would create lakes and rivers.
Then we could introduce plants to fill the air with oxygen.
Animals and people could now breathe the air.
A new world might be ready for us to colonize.
What would life be like on Mars?
Perhaps we could build farms and cities.
Or perhaps we will leave Mars as we found it.
Those decisions will be made by our descendants.
If terraforming is possible, it would take thousands of years.
By then, we may have left our solar system to explore the stars beyond.
Though it would take 100,000 years to reach them with present technology future generations may travel faster.
For the present, we must use telescopes to explore the stars.
Now, we are about to launch into space an instrument that will allow us to look far into the universe and back in time, almost to its birth.
This is the Hubble Space Telescope.
Once in orbit above the shimmer of the atmosphere it will see 10 times farther than telescopes on the ground.
Astronauts Kathy Sullivan, Loren Shriver and Bruce McCandless have come here to the Lockheed Vehicle Assembly facility for a final inspection.
Loved ones gather for the launch at the Kennedy Space Center.
Among them is Dr. Lyman Spitzer who first proposed the idea for a space telescope in 1946.
This is a tremendous milestone today for me.
Very exciting, very exciting.
I suggested a telescope of this nature would be very helpful to astronomy.
The idea finally took hold among astronomers and then among other people.
Finally, even in Congress.
Off it goes.
T-minus 10, go for main engine start.
We are go for main engine start.
Five, four, three, two, one....
And liftoff of the space shuttle Discovery.
Once Hubble is deployed astronomers will be able to direct its eye to any region of the universe they wish to observe.
While pilot Charlie Bolden, at left, maintains the shuttle's position astronomer Steve Hawley prepares for the deployment.
Discovery, go for Hubble release.
Hawley releases the telescope.
Then very slowly and carefully retracts the arm.
The sky and sea of Earth, reflected in its door the Hubble Space T elescope the creation of 10,000 people, is launched at last.
It will remain here for many years, sending images back to Earth.
Shuttle crews will visit Hubble on regular service calls to replace and upgrade its parts.
Yeah, it looks good.
I don't see any motion at all in there.
Hubble is open for business.
I wish you guys had been here.
You'll never believe it.
Superb is an understatement.
The telescope would reveal objects in detail never before seen.
But there was a problem.
A flaw was found in the shape of the telescope's primary mirror.
A repair would be necessary.
As part of the regular service another crew would make the repairs three years later.
First, the crew would have to recapture the telescope.
Houston, Endeavour, the right solar array, as we can see one side of it is bent way over.
Clearly we have a dynamic situation.
There's a problem with one of the solar panels that provide power to the telescope.
Looks like the outer bi-stem has a kink in it and is twisted 90-plus degrees clockwise there at the kink.
Once the telescope is secured in the cargo bay the astronauts will move outside for a close inspection.
So begins the most ambitious and difficult service mission ever attempted.
Story Musgrave and astronomer Jeff Hoffman are both veteran spacewalkers.
They'll depressurize here in the airlock then go to work.
The crew planned to replace the solar panels as part of the regular service.
But now, the twisted panel cannot be safely stowed in the cargo bay.
They have no choice but to throw it overboard.
Mission Specialist Kathy Thornton will do it.
A large object floating in space can pose a hazard to other spacecrafts.
So bursts from the jets are fired directly at the panel to make it spin.
Motion will speed its descent to the atmosphere where it will burn up.
Now, work on the telescope can resume.
Okay, coming straight on up.
Looking good.
I'm gonna let go.
Okay, take me away.
Come right on up easy, just like that.
Bring the forward up a little.
It's difficult to maneuver bodies and equipment unassisted.
The repair of the telescope would be impossible without the shuttle's arm.
It is controlled by Swiss astronaut, Claude Nicollier while Ken Bowersox, the pilot, acts as lookout.
The wide-field planetary camera will tell us about the size of the universe and how rapidly it is expanding.
The crew lifts it up with great care.
The tiniest bump could damage its delicate parts.
The astronaut teams alternate each day spending up to six hours in the cold vacuum outside.
All their tools must be tethered to keep them from floating into space.
After five days of intensive work and dazzling accomplishments the astronauts will install the corrective optics package.
It's a kind of contact lens designed to bring Hubble's giant eye into focus.
If it succeeds we will be able to look back to the edge of time.
The service and repair are now complete.
The mission drew upon skills we've learned throughout three decades of work in space.
Whether repairing a telescope, assembling a space station or building a base on a far planet we must rely upon the teamwork of humans and machines if we are to succeed in this new environment away from Earth.
You 've got a go for release.
The Cape of Good Hope beneath it the space telescope is now poised to begin a new era of exploration.
One astonishing discovery is a first look at an enormous and very unstable star we call Eta Carinae.
Four-million times more luminous than our sun its last outburst was seen in 1841.
Now Hubble reveals that it has blown two massive clouds into space.
The clouds contain the heavy elements essential for the creation of life.
In the heart of the Orion Nebula Hubble reveals a stellar nursery.
Gas and dust are condensing here to create new stars.
And even more astounding new planets are being born.
Never before seen, the dark material appears to be a new solar system forming around a young sun.
Hubble has now provided evidence that planets are common in the universe.
Life may be widespread among them.
Perhaps we will hear a signal.
Our curiosity and our need to progress to explore our solar system our galaxy, and the universe beyond.
The distances are vast, the voyage hazardous the destination daunting.
Still, we choose to explore.
What we discover...
In the Milky Way galaxy, circling a star called the Sun ... is a small planet inhabited by intelligent life.
Earthlings have always been curious creatures.
Even as we discovered our own world, we dreamed of exploring others.
Perhaps other beings inhabit planets around distant stars.
If they are sending signals ... we could detect them with this powerful radio telescope ... and maybe send a signal back across the cosmos.
But might we ourselves leave our home on Earth ... to explore new worlds?
We have already taken the first small steps outside our planet.
We designed this shuttlecraft to carry people and cargo up into orbit.
Here, far above the Earth's atmosphere ... we're learning how to live and work in space.
You've got a go to maneuver the orbiter.
It's doing nose sweep, going towards the starboard side.
The exterior shows just a little of the expected wear and tear ... of many trips back and forth.
The shuttle is equipped with a robotic arm ... to move large payloads ferried up from Earth.
Houston, do we have a go for maneuver?
It has lifted from the cargo bay ... a spacecraft which carries a German telescope named ORFEUS ... and a remotely operated IMAX camera.
Through its lens, we are seeing as never before ... the exterior of the shuttle as it orbits the Earth.
Discovery, Houston.
You have a go for release.
Copy that.
Now the ORFEUS telescope has been released into orbit.
We are riding with it, floating free in space.
Beneath us the shuttle pulls away, its cargo bay empty.
ORFEUS will spend several days ... observing the hottest and coldest gases in our galaxy.
Then the shuttle will take it back to Earth.
Over three decades, we've learned how to travel back and forth to space ... and live in low Earth orbit.
Now that we have taken these first steps, are we ready ... to cross the great black void to explore the other worlds in our solar system?
The journey will be hundreds of times farther than any we have ever undertaken.
First, we need to understand how we adapt to weightlessness.
The nine hours of work scheduled for the blue shift ... one and a half hour for green.
Connected by tunnel to the crew cabin, a laboratory known as Spacelab ... is carried in the cargo bay on certain flights.
Inside it, scientists are performing experiments ... developed by 13 different countries.
Two medical doctors, Norm Thagard and Roberta Bondar, a Canadian ... are studying how our sensory systems behave ... when introduced to microgravity.
More than half the astronauts experience space motion sickness ... the first day or two.
We're getting one last calibration, Dave.
German payload specialist Ulf Merbold is conducting an experiment ... to find out more about how it happens.
I've got vection.
The subject sees one thing, but he feels another.
His brain is confused by these conflicting messages ... and he becomes disoriented.
Is the spacecraft rotating ... or are we?
While Roberta spins, a tiny camera inside her helmet ... is recording the movements of her eye as it reacts to the motion.

When the results are compared ... it becomes clear that the more time people spend in space ... the more they rely on the visual sense alone for orientation.
But these results tell us only about how we adapt in the short term.
Spores three goes to centrifuge 204.
Make sure it says spore 31G.
Spores ― Which one?
To find out how we're affected by longer stays ... people must live continuously in a space station.
There, we could learn how to maintain a closed life-support system ... for months or years at a time.
One more.
Interesting.
Recycling is a must.
Future astronauts will be accomplished gardeners.
They will tend small farms in space ... like this hydroponic garden at the Kennedy Space Center ... that uses recycled water and oxygen to grow food.
The plants must be kept free of contamination.
Halfway to another planet, a crop failure would be a disaster.
A hundred and eighty reps left.
Keeping fit is another challenge.
With no body weight to support, our muscles get weaker.
Bones become brittle.
The longer we stay, the worse the problems become.
Hey, Bobby!
Come on up here.
We're going by Canada.
People traveling to other planets ... will spend years living in a very confined space.
What kinds of emotional stress will we face?
Will we get homesick, so far from everything we know ... isolated from family and friends and the familiar comforts of home?
There she is, John.
Don't run into our home.
Our first journeys to another world were to our nearby Moon.
Tranquility Base, Houston.
You are cleared for takeoff.
But those round trips took barely a week.
Today, on the Mir station ...
Russian cosmonauts live in space for many months.
From time to time, new crews arrive from Earth in the Soyuz craft.
Now, after almost a year in orbit ... the cosmonauts will return home in Soyuz.
And even though they've spent up to six hours exercising each day ... when re-exposed to Earth's gravity, they are temporarily unable to stand up.

But until recently, tethers were merely an elegant idea.
The concept would have to be tested.
So far we have good satellite stability.
So an experiment was flown on the space shuttle.
An Italian satellite was deployed on a very long tether.
The crew was then to retrieve it.
Let's do it like we simmed it.
You're gonna keep the tether under control, right?
Okay.
At first, the tether behaved exactly as predicted.
- You don't want to yank on the satellite. │
- You've got good tension.
And the Rdot is just oscillating a little bit, but it's based at zero.
- Slack tether.
- Wait a minute.
But then the reel jammed and the tether went slack.
Houston, we have slack tether.
Ldot has stopped.
By firing jets on both the orbiter and the satellite ... the crew learned that they could tighten it once again ... showing that we can control tethers in space.
Tether's under control.
Unexpected snags are bound to arise.
But we learn from them and keep moving forward.
To build more reliable spacecraft, we need light but tough materials.
To test them, in 1984 we launched a satellite ... with dozens of materials attached to its surface ... exposing them to the wear and tear of space.
Columbia, Houston.
We have a tally-ho on LDEF.
We left it in orbit for six years, long enough for an interplanetary trip.
Ready to go get it?
Then the shuttle retrieved it and took it back to Earth.
We found a wealth of information embedded in these panels.
Splatters.
As the microscopes reveal ... the vacuum of space is anything but empty.
This pattern, I don't know what this is.
A continuous bombardment of micrometeorites ... pitted the surfaces with craters.
But the most serious hazard in space is radiation.

Most of the planets are too hostile for people to visit.
But that doesn't stop us from exploring them.
Okay, understand.
We have a go for deploy, so we're starting out.
Five, four, three ... two, one, mark.
- Do we have motion?
- I see motion.
It's stable?
It's clear of the ASE.
Where humans cannot safely go ... we send remotely controlled robot explorers.
Commanding them from Earth ... we use their electronic eyes and sensors to explore the alien landscape.

And down.
Astronauts Kathy Sullivan, Loren Shriver and Bruce McCandless ... have come here to the Lockheed Vehicle Assembly facility ... for a final inspection.
That's the socket in the MLI that you put the pre-load tool in ... once you've got the door open ... and just crank it over center so it'll stay open.
Hello, hello, hello.
Howdy.
Morning.
Family and friends gather for the launch at the Kennedy Space Center.
Among them is Dr. Lyman Spitzer ... who first proposed the idea for a space telescope in 1946.
This is a tremendous milestone today for me.
Very exciting, very exciting.
I suggested a telescope of this general nature would be very helpful to astronomy.

And off it goes.
T-minus 10, go for main engine start.
We are go for main engine start.
Five, four, three, two, one ....
And lift-off of the space shuttle Discovery.
Once Hubble is deployed ... astronomers on the ground will be able to direct its eye ... to any region of the universe they wish to observe.
- Give you a payload ID of one.
- Discovery, we'd like you to go free drift.
While pilot Charlie Bolden, on the left, maintains the shuttle's precise position ... astronomer Steve Hawley prepares to perform the deployment.
Discovery, go for Hubble release.
Hawley releases the telescope.
Then, very slowly and carefully ... retracts the arm.
The sky and sea of Earth, reflected in its door ... the Hubble Space Telescope ... the creation of 10,000 people, is launched at last.
It will remain here for many years, sending images back to Earth.
Shuttle crews will visit Hubble on regular service calls ... to replace and upgrade its parts.
Yeah, it looks good.
I don't see any motion at all in there.
Hubble is open for business.
I wish you guys had been here to see it, because you'll never believe it.
Well, superb is an understatement.
Residuals were at .02 and .01.
The telescope would reveal objects in detail ... never before seen.
But there was a problem:
A flaw was found in the shape of the telescope's primary mirror.
A repair would be necessary.

Once the telescope is secured in the cargo bay ... the astronauts will move outside for a closer inspection.
So begins the most ambitious and difficult service mission ... ever attempted.
Payload commander Story Musgrave and astronomer Jeff Hoffman ... are both veteran spacewalkers.
Story is not built like the rest of us.
Most of us just float under the hut, and Story has to screw himself in.
If you're a person that gets claustrophobia, this is not the business you wanna get into.
They'll depressurize here in the airlock ... then go to work.
It had been planned that the crew replace the solar panels ... as part of the regular service.
But now, the twisted panel cannot be safely stowed in the cargo bay.
They have no choice but to throw it overboard.
Mission Specialist Kathy Thornton will do it.
- Okay, they say you've got a go for release. │
- Okay, no hands.
Such a large object floating in space can pose a hazard to other spacecraft.
So bursts from the shuttle jets are fired ... directly at the solar panel to make it spin.
The motion will speed up its descent to the Earth's atmosphere ... where it will burn up.
There it goes.
Almost like a bird.
Look at it.
It's quite a sight.
Now, work on the telescope can resume.
Okay, coming straight on up.
Looking real good.
I'm gonna let go.
Okay, take me away.
Just come right up easy, just like you're doing.
Bring the forward up a little more.
It's difficult to maneuver bodies and equipment unassisted.
The repair of the telescope would be almost impossible ... without the help of the shuttle's arm.
It is controlled from inside by Swiss astronaut Claude Nicollier ... while Ken Bowersox, the pilot, acts as lookout.
Just keep coming up, Claude.
- Stop.
Stop.
- Brake's on.
I'm not even pulling it, I'm just coaxing it with my fingertips.
The new wide-field planetary camera will tell us more about the size ... of the universe and how rapidly it is expanding.
Here we go.
The crew lifts it up with great care.
The tiniest bump could damage its delicate parts.
The astronaut teams alternate each day ... spending up to six hours in the cold vacuum outside.
Okay, I'm gonna slip over.
You've got another foot to keep coming up.
Keep coming up.
Coming up.
Coming up.
All of their tools must be tethered to the workstation ... to keep them from floating off into space.
Endeavour, Houston for Story.
You've got a go to open the doors.
Okay.
Swing it.
After five days of intensive work and many dazzling accomplishments ... the astronauts are now ready to install the critical corrective-optics package.
It's a kind of contact lens ... designed to bring Hubble's giant eye into focus.
Pitch up a little.
If it succeeds ... we will be able to look back to the edge of time.
Good work, guys.
The service and repair are now complete.
The mission drew upon every skill we have learned ... throughout three decades of work in space.
Whether repairing a telescope, assembling a space station ... or building a base on a distant planet ... we must rely upon the teamwork of humans and machines ... if we are to succeed in this challenging new environment away from Earth.
Endeavour, you've got a go for release.
The Cape of Good Hope beneath it ... the space telescope is now poised to begin a new era of exploration.
One of the astonishing discoveries ... is a first close look at an enormous and very unstable star ... we call Eta Carinae.
Four million times more luminous than our Sun ... its last outburst was seen in 1841.
And now Hubble reveals that it has blown two massive clouds into space.
The clouds contain the heavy elements essential for the creation of life.
Now, in the heart of the Orion Nebula ...
Hubble reveals a stellar nursery.
Gas and dust are condensing here to create new stars.
And even more astounding ... new planets are being born.
Never before seen, the dark material appears to be a new solar system ... forming around a young sun.
Hubble has now provided evidence that planets are common in the universe.
Life may be widespread among them.
Perhaps we will hear a signal.
Our curiosity and our need to progress ... compel us to move outward ... to explore the worlds of our solar system ... our galaxy, and the universe beyond.
The distances are vast, the voyage hazardous ... the destination daunting.
Still, we choose to explore.
What we discover ... will shape our destiny in space.
- What's it guzzle?
- About twenty litres.
Roughly.
Cheap to run.
Good car.
Does it run on gas or diesel?
Depends on what you teach it to use.
Not bad, eh?
I can give you a good price.
What's your offer?
We haven't got much.
How much?
Eight.
- Eight what?
- Thousand.
Eight thousand crowns?
Let's look there, then.
Take a good look at this one.
It's a Pontiac.
This is what the one over there could look like.
When you put it together.
Eight thousand crowns.
A '93 model, ABS, air conditioning.
- Where's the engine?
- In the shed.
But it's registered and has number plates.
But we want to drive it tomorrow.
Well guys, you should have put more away.
Sorry.
We've fucked!
Is there anything here that we could drive away?
This Kadet's not too bad.
They can all run.
Back there we've engines, wheels... no problem.
Just needs a simple fix-up.
- But we want to hit the road now.
- Let's take a look over there.
- But none of them are registered.
- Let me worry about the papers.
Plates too.
I like you guys, you go far.
I'm going to give you choice.
French plates.
Just say "Bonjour ".
Works a treat to the cops if they stop you...
They're stupid.
They'll let you go.
German doesn't work anymore.
"Guten Tag " they know...
- So, French plates are better.
- I won't be driving it...
Doesn't matter who's driving.
It's just a better cover.
- So how much?
- How much d'you have?
- Eight thousand.
- Eight?
You're kidding me.
I should chuck this in and do charity work.
So it's a deal?
THE RIDE
/We'll find a place
/where the smoking's good.
/Where the hot sun
/doesn't sting the drinks.
/Where the wind spreads /bits of bird shit
/all around us and says
/We've got to try /what tastes the best
/and calmly wait /till someone comes.
/Someone who knows /that we're sitting here,
/and who will say "hi, boys".
/I've got one long arm.
/One long arm for you.
/Come sit with us
/we'll listen to you.
/We'll think on what
/we've got to do.
/Give us your hand
/and you'll relax...
/on that spot /where one feels blue.
Bonjourrr...
The main roads are for cops and criminals.
The side roads are for us.
Haven't we been here before?
The Prague Health Dept.
issued a warning about the poor quality of water in swimming pools.
This is due to people peeing in the water.
And, quote: "Everyone's peeing ", say City health officials.
It says that a shrew is around one and a half times the length of a credit card.
That's a progress.
We used to use match boxes to compare the scale of things.
God for instance.
Let's check this scale.
- So what's the verdict?
- God is great!
Let's plug ourselves into the world.
A Roumanian girl would be ideal.
- What for?
- We could share her both.
- They're good, eh?
- No, but if she didn't like it, she couldn't complain, nobody would understand her.
And we could say that we thought she wanted to, right?
Or a Hungarian.
For sure.
- Aren't they all ugly?
- We can't be too choosy.
Or we can pick up a real beauty, have her in the woods...
But then we'd have to bury her.
We got a shovel.
A tropical heat wave has paralyzed traffic in the capital.
Traffic on most major routes is gridlocked and not moving.
Seems as if it never will.
Good afternoon.
- C'mon.
We'll give you a ride.
- Oh no, boys, it's not worth it.
- I live here in this village.
- C'mon.
Here.
But it's really not worth it.
- Your rake...
- See, with my rake.
Such a nice car.
I'll only scratch it up.
You'll sit up front...
- Here we go.
- Where are coming from?
Oh, the fields.
Working, you know.
Raking hay.
- You still rake hay?
- Sure.
- And where do you come from?
- We're from Prague.
I hope you find some nice ladies and enjoy your holiday.
- Stop right here, by this lady.
- Here?
I told you, it's not worth it...
Now can I have my rake.
Thank you.
Where were you...
... that you needed a lift.
They were just nice boys...
from Prague.
Even then we only gave her a short lift.
It was still a good deed!
If we hadn't taken her, we'd be three miles further.
But it's not true.
It's impossible.
So we're actually three miles behind, you see...
So, whatever happens from now on wasn't meant to be.
A magic moment.
What's up?
Where you going?
The reward for our good deed.
Hi.
Want a ride?
What are you doing here?
C'mon.
Get in.
You'll die here.
Ants will eat you alive.
- What were you doing there?
- Nothing.
So what were you leaving behind?
Panties.
Where to?
Doesn't matter.
I'll get off somewhere.
- We can take you home...
- No.
Did something happen to you?
I'd like a drink.
Can be arranged.
What's he doing?
Arshole.
- Do you speak English?
- Czech.
You didn't see a redhead somewhere around here?
- No.
- No, we haven't.
What do you want to drink, then?
Gin.
No ice.
And tonic.
- There's no gin.
- Doesn't matter.
What?
She says it doesn't matter.
What?
- It doesn't matter.
- Fernet, then.
- So what does she want?
- Fernet.
What's this place called?
Where are you going?
South.
The sea?
The car hasn't any papers, so it can't cross the border.
So what do you do when you get to the border?
We'll go either east or west.
- Going through Pelhrimov?
- No.
But we can take you there if you want.
What I really want is a drink.
Who was that in the car?
A guy.
Did he do something to you?
No.
What did she say?
Nothing.
I think she's a bit wacky.
Well then work on her.
She could...
Did you notice that she hasn't put those panties on yet?
That means that under that skirt, she's actually, you know...
I guess so.
And probably doesn't even know it.
You think she's, like, nuts or something?
I don't know.
Well, no point in us fighting over her.
Look, she's put them back.
So she's not totally nuts.
So we won't get to see her little pussy after all.
Hey look.
A mirage.
That's where I'd like to go.
Just disappear.
It's the heat.
We say the air is sweating.
- Have you got any money?
- Money?
Why do you want to know?
Do you?
I don't have any.
So you'll have to look after me now.
Aha...?
That's why I'd like to know if you have any money.
Why?
Do you want it or what?
- No...
- So I don't get it.
Well, if I want something...
And do you want anything?
I'd like an ice-cream.
A Magnum.
D'you want to sit up front?
C'mon.
So will you tell me your name?
Why?
Does it matter?
I'll be getting off soon anyway.
Where are you getting out?
In Nepomuk?
So why don't you come with us to Susice at least, eh?
- What do you think you're doing?
- I should be asking you that.
Our contract states that this fridge is property of Algida.
You can't put other stuff in here.
Pragolaktos, Scholler.
I'm surprised you don't keep chicken and spinach in here too.
So it's Annie?
I'm Radek.
Hi.
- Cute little knuckles.
- Don't say that.
Why not?
I want to...
It's just talk.
Isn't it?
I don't have another freezer.
Freezers should be provided by those companies that supply you.
I am hereby disconnecting and sealing ours.
So what should I say to make you stay with us?
Am I going anywhere?
- Well, no.
Not yet you aren't.
- So don't say anything yet.
Do I annoy you?
No.
It's just...
I don't want to talk now.
Will you require a receipt for these samples?
That way I could record how much of the other stuff there was.
- Well then don't bother.
- Alright then.
One more Magnum.
See you.
- It's freezing me!
- So put it on the floor.
No!
It's mine.
Mine!
Oh, shit!
/Come here, little mouse, /come to me!
/No I won't, little cat, /you'd eat me.
/Yes you will, yes you will, /you know it, too.
/Dog!
Kill the cat!
/Kill the cat!
/I want to look, /want to look at it.
/I want to look as it /squeals under your paws.
/And if it survives, /if it survives... /...
I'll tie you up, and let /the cat scratch out your eyes.
/And then I'll wrap myself up /in barbed wire and plug it... /... into a socket and /release the devil.
I get the feeling he really wants to see you again.
Poor guy.
He must be really mad.
Why are you running away from him?
I don't like him anymore.
I don't want him.
So why are you going with him, then?
He does whatever he wants...
... with me.
So we'll teach him a lesson, right?
Do you have a gun?
No, we don't.
Unless there's one in the trunk.
Does he have one?
No.
But he might have got one.
That would be just like him:
he's really aggressive.
He once kicked the shit out of a guy just because he was talking to me.
Beat him to a pulp.
Is he really such a tough guy?
Are you that afraid of him?
I messed up my dress.
Totally.
That can be washed.
I don't have anything to change into.
It's all in his car.
- So what do you think?
- Why do you ask?
You want her.
Well, if you want to know, I am not having fun.
Since we picked her up we've hardly spoken to each other.
We're wasting our time running away from some arshole.
- At least something's happening.
- She's only got that one dress.
And I bet she's used to a lot of money.
I bet she'd expect a hotel.
You think she's going to stay with us overnight?
She'll smoke all of our grass and then we'll never get rid of her.
- That wouldn't bother me at all.
- I don't mind either.
But for God's sake, go screw her.
Just look at you.
- Now?
In broad daylight?
No.
- I'll swimm the other way.
Hey, come on... don't.
- I'll turn around if you're shy.
- I'm not shy.
If I were a guy, I couldn't bear it.
What?
The way it shrinks like that in the water.
It must be awfully humiliating?
It's normal.
Happens to everyone.
- Let's go for a walk somewhere.
- Where's the other guy?
Over there, on the other side.
He wants to be alone.
So, what's the story with the panties?
Well, I was being a bit naughty.
Can you believe I had to take them off and throw them away just because someone else gave them to me.
- Would that upset you too?
- Who'd you get them from?
- I don't know.
My Mum, I guess.
- Oh, from your Mum!
Don't.
Not here.
Why not?
- I can't make love.
- Why can't you?
Because I'm not turned on.
So tell me what to do to turn you on.
But I don't want to be turned on.
Well.
That's different.
Maybe we'll make love.
But not here and not now.
We're free-wheeling.
- Can I take the keys out?
- No!
The steering wheel would lock.
And that curve would finish us.
Why do we have to follow the road all the time?
Such a nice hill...
Why can't we just go straight?
We can do anything we want.
We can go straight.
OK.
We're going straight.
Take off your glasses.
Well, kids: it's been great.
Good bye.
Bye.
Ciao.
Too bad we didn't get to know each other better.
- But I'm afraid.
- Too late.
It's locked now.
Hang on.
We going to die?
Mummy!
I think I bit my tongue.
Oh, blood.
When I look up at the sky,
I see these two little bubbles or more like spots.
Where?
Only I can see them.
They're in my eye somewhere.
And they just go sailing through the sky...
When I don't look at them, they go where I'm looking.
But when I try to look at them, then they go off somewhere on their own.
So I pretend not to look at them, and then they come back to me.
And so I keep chasing them through the sky.
With me, it's a little line.
I haven't seen it for a long time, but it's still there.
Is there a moral in all this?
Don't know.
It's actually the first video game in the world.
Can you hear that?
- In the air.
Not on the ground.
- I know.
Smells nice, like those air fresheners in washrooms.
I don't smell anything.
I can't smell anything.
They're in a hurry, eh?
A cable car.
Take it down.
Hey Ferda!
Get Mary.
Wait, I'll get Mary.
I'm coming!
I've brought the broomsticks!
We're going to clean it up here.
Get Betty;
Betty will help you.
I'm the only female around.
And what are you going to do if we all jump you?
You don't have what it takes.
Careful I don't bite you.
Mary.
I'll behave myself.
So don't make me do it with everyone.
We'll see about that.
Said Ferda.
Where is she?
Over there.
- Where's she going?
- I don't know.
- She's leaving!
- No she's not.
- She is!
She's leaving us here.
- So let her go.
But she's got my t-shirt.
Wait, my t-shirt.
Hey mister!
Don't take her!
Why did she do that?
She had a great time with us.
What a bitch!
- So you didn't get any?
- Of course not.
- She left her dress here.
- She doesn't care.
And we're up shit creek.
Guess what?
It's cracked.
Great.
So we're not fucking going anywhere, are we?
- Nope.
Not likely.
- Fuck...
- Hey Radek, you got a fetish?
- Bull.
It's been washed.
Look, a tractor!
It's a work of art.
It's actually quite beautiful.
It's even signed.
Armabeton.
Do you think the pyramids are higher?
These have got to be higher.
Let's compare it to our matchbox.
Where's the steam?
Don't they work?
A work of art isn't supposed to work.
It provokes an emotional response.
They're telling us: "Save, energy, or we'll turn on."
/An actress at the Comedie /told me
/she'd take me away /to Nowhereland.
/To Nowhereland...
Shit!
It stinks.
I'm going to dry my dress.
/The clouds fly /low above the ground.
/Fly fast, my head is spinning.
T/he clouds fly /low above the ground... /For the last time /I envy the clouds... /... the way that they can see /the world.
/The clouds fly /low above the ground... /One day she'll take me away...
/far away...
No one's in control!
What would you do, what would you do if you had only one year to live?
Depends on what you mean.
Well, would you drop everything and just live it up...
Or would you try to leave something behind?
What's the point of leaving something behind?
One should leave something behind.
Kids, at least.
So Frank, you can die in peace.
- You're a dad?
- Yeah.
- You're married?
- Yeah.
- And it's enough for you?
- Totally.
But in any event, I don't want to die.
- And are you married?
- No way.
So you can do what you like...
- You could say that.
- So what do you do?
I've a girlfriend...
That's enough for you?
- Two hundred.
- Each?
- Per room.
- I'm sleeping in the car.
That's five Jim Beam's.
Hope she's worth it.
At least she didn't steal anything.
Where did she go?
No money; nothing; at night.
She won't get lost.
She's gone.
I think she's really gone.
I should have gone with her to the shower.
It was an invitation.
I should've gone up with her.
If only I didn't have that drink, it would've been okay.
- I think it's fate or something.
- What?
That this particular girl was on the road...
Jesus, if she's your fate, then God help you.
What do I know?
- You really didn't like her?
- No.
Pretty girl.
Just forget her.
Such a cute smile.
Nice red hair.
She had that cute peachfuzz all over her...
Get some sleep.
All because of one drink...
One drink less, and she'd still be here.
No need to wash.
No.
Then night.
- I brought breakfast.
- Hey, hi.
- What's this cat doing here?
- Sleeping.
Look what I did.
Here.
- God, what happened?
- A wire with little thorns...
- It's called barbed wire.
- Where were you?
- Somewhere.
- All night?
And the wire was rusty.
So now I've got blood poisoning, right?
No you haven't.
You've been vaccinated.
"We're " vaccinated against tooth, mouth, shedding and worms.
We've a dog.
A German Shepherd.
He's really neurotic.
We always have to pay attention to him, otherwise he bites.
Once I was playing with Johnny.
- The dog?
- No, the guy.
The one who's chasing us?
And I had him tied to the bed by his hands and feet.
And we were playing around.
And when it grew hard, I brought in the dog.
When the dog came up to him he wanted to be petted.
He couldn't move or even shout because that'd upset the dog.
He just lay there.
He couldn't do anything.
And I stood behind the door and watched him sweat in fear.
"Throwing rocks into the river and on the slopes is forbidden."
"Irresponsible behaviour can lead to serious injury to persons..."
"... in the afore-mentioned areas." The International City Council.
Why don't you have the dog put down?
- But we love him.
He's ours.
- So how did it turn out?
- Did he bite it off?
- No.
He just sniffed it.
I sure wouldn't let you tie me up.
But we haven't known each other long enough.
Would they shoot at us if he isn't armed?
It's true they only shoot ones who're armed?
- How do you know he isn't?
- I didn't see a gun.
Smile.
It's the cops.
They're coming back.
BANK
- OK?
- Not bad.
When I do something I shouldn't,
I feel like everyone's watching me.
That's because they are.
We should get out of here.
I need to pee.
- Are you scared?
- You don't want to?
Not at the moment.
What's taking him so long?
Where are you heading?
- Where do you want to go?
- To Hell.
Hell?
Marie, some Hell...?
- Don't they mean Devil's Rocks?
- Oh yeah.
Go down here...
No, go right here, right, left, turn after half a mile...
Let's go!
- Got it?
- Got it.
-How much?
- I took a thousand.
- Great.
Guys, I've got to pee.
- Shouldn't they be chasing us?
- We're safe now...
- Only a thousand crowns?
- It was only a village bank.
Can I drive now?
Do you know how?
I can't do the pedals.
But I can do the steering wheel.
Let's do it together.
I can only work the gears.
- So you don't need me anymore.
- You're going to do the pedals.
/A farmer in the field
/was looking for his cow... /For him villages or towns,
/didn't matter now,
/nothing but that cow, /hiding in the grass... /as high as the ocean's deep.
/Black water, blind fish, /poisonous sea beasts,
/in the farmer's head came /the snap of the thread.
/His spool's not turning,
/and there's no conductor /to say... /... while stroking his hair:
/You're with me on my train /in my care.
I am driving!
Don't go home, the contest hasn't finished...
I'd like to thank to the volunteer Fire Department.
Go away, kids!
Get lost!
So what's the story?
You left him, or he threw you out?
No.
We had a fight.
And how long have you been together?
About four years.
But we've argued a lot, so we haven't been together the whole time.
It's really more like two years.
And why do you fight?
Don't know.
Spice up our lives I guess.
And what do you do when you're not fighting?
We go away somewhere and fight there too.
- Want a smoke?
- I can't.
I'm working.
With the sun shining through your ears, you look like an alien.
My little girlfriend...
For the monks who built this place it was like taming the Wild West.
There was nothing here.
Only forests... and more forests.
Bears.
Wolves.
- And huge ants.
- How huge?
Like this.
The monks came with their saws.
And chopped down the trees.
They pulled out the stumps and started hauling boulders.
But first, they killed the huge ants.
I always thought of monks as impotent cripples.
They were regular guys.
Musclemen.
And they did this all by themselves?
Yup.
They built, painted, wrote, and prayed to God.
And there weren't any women?
Women weren't allowed here.
For seven-hundred years.
Do you smell it?
It's in all monasteries.
It's the spirit of the place.
It smells like this in the confessional booth.
I read somewhere that when men live without women, they begin to give off a funny smell.
What d'you call it?
- What are you trying to say?
- Something like ingraining?
Absorbtion?
Yeah.
Absorbtion.
Semen absorbtion.
For seven hundred years, it's been evaporating here.
I want you to do it to me here.
Wimp.
/I'm dying,
/my strength's leaving me,
/I forgive what I should,
/and then I leave my body...
/... while I turn into dust.
/I'm dying and my only wish...
/... is that /you will dream of me.
It musn't smell of cow shit.
And I need my own room.
And I need a stove.
That little cottage looks nice.
Or that tiny little one.
This is a nice little cottage.
I'm scared.
That's that guy...
The one they set fire to.
- That's Palach, right?
- That's Hus.
That's the Red Fox.
Sigmund.
And he's saying, hey, buddy, you there, Mister Jan Hus.
Hey, that's Dusek.
From my school.
A guitar.
It's for me.
Look at all the little records.
Matuska, Sodoma...
- Neckar...
Korn!
- Kids, remember Korn?
- You know how to turn it on?
- It still works?
A record.
Look.
His picture's on it.
Winnetou laughs from the window and Shatterhand is kissing Rybana's breasts.
Inchuchuna in the yard started up his motorcar.
Motorcar is bust.
Inchuchuna's dust.
Blow it out!
An old newspaper from the communist times.
In Sri Lanka due to conflicts between the majority Singhalese, and the minority Tamils, May Day has been outlawed.
Simple solution.
The National Congress of Pathologists:
The official program has been enlivened with a social event:
An evening organ pipe concert...
Hang glider pilots participated in the parade.
Driver Hlasek delivered the cargo straight to the Tymakov facility.
There the grain will remain over the weekend.
Then it will be transported to the Processing Centre in Prestice.
- I don't get it.
- What are you reading?
What is it?
It's a speech by Comrade Husak.
Every paragraph here starts with Comrades this and Comrades that.
The Robin Hood of the desert...
Saddam Hussein is distributing Kuwaiti land...
That was that war in the Gulf?
That was January fifteenth, Ninety-One.
Two days before the war,
I lost my virginity with Johnny.
You were under age, weren't you?
- I was fourteen.
- So now he is paying for it.
See how happy this piece looks.
While all you guys do is argue.
I had my first hysterical fit of laughter playing this game.
I was six.
What's that?
It's called a phone.
An invention over a hundred years old.
Why is it ringing?
Did you know that the Americans won the WWII because they knew how to use the telephone?
Loser gets us something to drink.
And some food.
- Five.
- That's silly.
Two.
Ha!
One.
That's stupid.
But you're going to have to go anyway.
Radek can't drive.
How come she's doesn't have anything there?
I wonder what they look like now.
How old they must be.
Maybe fifty.
Or sixty.
What would you have done, if you had stayed here with Frank?
He's a man.
What do you mean by that?
He'd take what he wants.
So you'd sleep with him?
Anne, would you?
I want to talk about something else.
Yeah, but this interests me, so tell me.
You want to know?
You really want to know?
Yes I do.
And can you handle it?
Can you take it?
Maybe we already have.
When did you have the time to?
I was always with you.
Promise me that you won't say anything.
I would feel ashamed and you would look silly.
Maybe in Susice.
You slept like a baby all night.
- Frank wouldn't do it to me.
- Yes he would.
What are you going to do?
What?
- I don't know.
- Are you a man, or what?
Go away, will you?
Get lost.
I'm bored.
When did he call?
It's always the same thing.
I don't know.
Somewhere in Sumava.
In Loucky.
Yeah.
Whatever he says.
I don't care.
Hi Anne.
What is it?
I don't want to!
It hurts!
You bastard.
I'm going to scream.
C'mon does it really hurt that much?
I don't want to cause you pain.
But it has to be done.
Don't.
I won't scream anymore.
- You have to be brave.
- I couldn't stand it.
- It won't last long.
- My hands hurt.
I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
Don't leave me here.
Untie me you bastard!
What's that?
What's that for?
What are you going to do with that?
Radek!
Radek, talk to me.
For God's sake, what are you doing with that?
That's petrol.
I love you.
Don't scream.
But there are candles everywhere.
I know.
I made all that up, about Frank.
Everything.
You know, I actually believed you for a while.
So why are you doing this?
- Because I love you.
- I love you too.
But we're just not getting it together, are we?
It would always be like that.
We want it at different times.
Now we can make love.
Then it will all be over.
I haven't even said good-bye to my Mum yet.
She has no idea where I am.
I've got beer and sausages.
When you're thru, I'll be outside.
I can't do this.
Do it.
Untie my legs and do it.
I want it.
I really really want it.
I can't do this.
One chicken, seventy five.
- Do you have any soups?
- We do, we do.
Packed soups, ghoulash, beef, leek.
I'll show you...
French, pea, beef...
- We should go after them.
- I don't think so.
I don't have her address or telephone number.
If she wanted you to have it, she'd have given it to you.
Sometimes girls forget to...
No they don't.
You know, I wonder if she called him before or after she was with you.
Why?
Well if she called after, then that doesn't say much about you.
Alright.
I'll tell you.
I never slept with her.
You're an idiot.
I really didn't.
We're free-wheeling.
Tailor, Sailor, Soldier, Daddy.
- Don't call me daddy.
- We are facing a major decision:
East or west.
Because we're through with the south.
Shit, the cops.
Keep cool, it's just an accident.
Oh God.

Lassie, come home!
All right, folks, it's moving day.
- I told you not to watch this crap.
- I like "Lassie".
Jennifer!
You'll thank me when you're older.
Jennifer!
Breakfast, honey.
You better hurry.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'm fine!
Matt!
2.30!
We're going!
Steve, did you load that brown suitcase?
It's under four suitcases.
- I put Jennifer's books in it for the trip.
- Why would you do that?
I'm sorry.
Honey...
- Last minute jitters.
- Me, too.
- Does this move make sense?
- Yes.
We're going to be living in the house where Anne grew up.
I can handle that I think.
Jennifer, how many kids are there in the world?
- I don't know.
- Billions, OK?
- A quarter of those are kids, right?
- Yeah.
Well, that means 250 million kids at about three presents a kid.
That means 750 million presents, in one night, with one guy and eight reindeer.
- Dad!
- What's going on?
- Nothing...
The guy is a hoax.
- Mom!
Her name is Laura.
We've got a long drive ahead of us, girl.
Matt, what do you say we stop and get something to eat?
Hey, Matt!
- Matt!
- Look out!
What a mess!
I got it, here we go.
All right, people, back in your cars.
All right, load up.
Looks like we're moving.
Hey, Matt, look!
It's Lassie!
Jennifer, there's no such thing.
First Santa Claus, now...
- Holy cow!
- See, I told you.
It is Lassie!
- Jennifer...
- It's Lassie, Dad.
- Jennifer, don't touch a strange dog.
- It's hurt.
- Jen, he'll be fine.
Come on.
- It's a she!
- Come on!
- We can't just leave her here.
- Steve...
- Honey, please!
She's all alone.
Matt, hop in.
Lumber's half-price, so the cost is low, and there's no hassle for permits.
- Can I play the jukebox?
I got money.
- No Paula Abdul or Janet Jackson.
- You're not going to eat that?
- I'm not hungry.
Then why did you order it?
- Look, it's Lassie, she's back!
- Jennifer, it's not Lassie.
- How do you know?
- Lassie doesn't exist.
Whatever doesn't exist just followed us here.
- Can we keep her?
- Of course not.
Why?
It probably belongs to somebody, and we're full enough as it is.
- There she is.
- How did you find us?
- Jen, be careful.
- See, she loves us.
She wants to be with us.
Sweetie, she doesn't really love us, she just wants food.
- Kids are supposed to have dogs.
- Jennifer!
- It helps us grow up right.
- I think she's sweet.
- Honey, you too?
- It's weird enough as it is.
- Why not add a dog?
- Honey, come on!
- Why not?
- Please, Dad!
This is ridiculous.
Where would we put it?
How about the back seat?
Come on, let's take her.
Please, Dad!
- All right, the back seat.
- Yes!
Hey, Matt!
Hey, cut it out!
Cut it out!
Get away from me.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Move over.
- This dog stinks.
- Look who's talking!
I don't have fur!
Come here, Lassie.
Well, this is it.
- Franklin Falls.
- 148?
It's the country, pal.
There's room out here.
148?
There's more people than that in a supermarket.
- Matt!
- There's more people on a subway.
- You've never been on a subway.
- I know what they hold.
You took us to nowhere.
That's where we've moved to.
- Soon you'll like it here.
- I'll take the bus back to Baltimore.
- There's my grandkids!
- Grandpa!
- Hello, princess.
- I missed you, Grandpa.
I missed you, too, honey.
And how's my big fellow?
- Is that an earring you're wearing?
- Yeah.
- Hi, Len.
- Hello, Steve.
Len, I'd like you to meet my wife, Laura.
- I'm glad to meet you, ma'am.
- It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
I can't tell you how good it is to have these two youngsters back with me.
- What do we have here?
- That's our new dog.
Just a stray we picked up on the side of the road.
Just a stray?
This is a beautiful dog.
- It's a fine pedigree, I bet you.
- See!
I guess you would like to see the house before it gets dark.
- I'll get the truck so you can follow me.
- That's all right, I remember the way.
Thank you.
There you are.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- See you then.
- Bye-bye, Grandpa.
- Good to see you, Matt.
- Bye, Grandpa.
Matt, all aboard.
All right, come on.
Wow, is that our farm?
It's beautiful!
No, sweetie, we're up the road.
Wouldn't you know, it's starting to rain.
No way, this is it?
Don't worry, it'll be better inside.
Wait, let me turn on the light.
Great.
Doesn't work.
Here you go, sweetie.
Be careful, Matt.
There's a note.
What?
It's from Len.
"The electricity went down in a storm, should be back in a couple of weeks."
"Sorry for the mess.
I tidied up the best I could.
Len."
- So there's no TV?
- No, Matt, there's no TV.
That's means there's no MTV.
Oh, great, really great.
- Why don't we just kill ourselves?
- Matt...
Take my hand, sweetie.
Watch your step there.
Let's take a look upstairs.
This bed seems OK.
We'll use sleeping bags until we get the sheets unpacked.
- Why bother?
- You and I are going to unload the car.
- Hey, don't forget this.
- Great!
No pavement!
What'll I do with this?
What kind of kid would want to live here?
It wasn't so bad for your mother!
- Could this be my room, Laura?
- I don't think anyone will fight you for it.
Yes!
Which room do you want, Matt?
Still raining.
- About what I said outside...
- Forget it, it was nothing.
No?
You know after your mother died, I made a point not to talk about her in front of you, because I could see how much it upset you.
I don't know if that was the right thing to do.
I know we can't bring her back, but that doesn't mean we need to forget her.
Goodnight, son.
- Dad, are you going to tuck me in?
- I'll be right there.
- You, too, Laura.
- OK, sweetheart.
I'm coming up.
Well, everybody wants a dog, I let the dog out.
That's all right.
Come on.
Oh, my...
Cool!
- Pots and pans.
- OK, that's a start.
All right, I'm off.
- When I'm back, we'll go to the store.
- Have a good meeting.
- You've got breakfast?
- Five boxes of Pop-Tarts.
- We don't have a toaster.
- Get out of here.
I'll call you later and let you know how it goes.
- We don't have a phone.
- Honey, it's going to be fine.
I know.
- See you later.
- OK.
Jennifer and I are going for a walk, do you want to come?
It's not like the city, you know.
We'll both be short on friends here.
What do you want?
Hey, come on, cut it out.
Look, I said cut it out!
Hey!
Hey!
Come back here!
Come on, give me those!
Drop those!
Drop those right now!
I'm going to kill you!
Give me my headphones!
Wait a minute!
Stay!
Stay!
Heel!
Give me those!
If you don't drop those...
Whoa!
How did you find this place?
Man, they got a rope here and everything.
Cool.
Looks cold!
That was awesome!
That was totally awesome!
I'm not kidding!
- Anything with that?
- No, I'm fine.
Thank you.
Mr Jarman, since our last conversation, I've worked out 3 preliminary options, depending on how much of the structure will remain.
- Based on your budget...
- That's what we need to talk about.
What?
Hi, Steve, how did it go?
- They don't want it.
- What?
- The new house, remodelling, nothing.
- Why?
He says he was running high credit at the bank, way too high.
The man just lost half his flock, and insurance isn't going to pay for it.
Len, I pulled my kids out of school.
This was going to cover me for 6-9 months.
It's a lousy break.
It's a damn lousy break, but you got you one job, you'll get another.
- That or some other type of work.
- What other work?
In the store, I hear about things.
There's always folks needing help fixing this or that.
You mean, being a handyman?
Len, I'm a builder, I'm a contractor.
Stop!
Don't shoot!
Hey, mister, that's my dog!
Don't worry.
I think I know the difference between a coyote and a collie.
Now, boys are another thing.
I don't often see one I don't know on my land.
- Aren't lost, are you?
- No, I know my way.
- I'm staying down at the Collins farm.
- Collins?
I bet you had to dust the cobwebs out of that place.
- Yeah, you're not kidding.
- Well, have a nice visit.
Thanks, but we're not visiting, we're going to live there.
Live there?
Well, now that's good news.
I got two boys just about your age.
I'll send them around.
You tell your daddy Sam Garland says welcome.
Went out hunting coyotes today...
Josh, pass this down to your mother.
I ran into a youngster who said they was moving on to the Collins place.
That's all right.
As long as they don't mess around with our flock.
- Right, boys?
- They won't, sir.
- Me and Jim will take care of that.
- That's what I like to hear.
Sam, you mustn't encourage the boys to do anything malicious...
Now, Mildred, who said anything about malicious?
I just want my boys to keep an eye on things.
We need that pasture.
- You know what I mean, right, Jim?
- Yes, sir.
- Josh, you know what I'm talking about?
- Yes, sir.
Mildred, you're a wonderful cook.
- I don't understand.
- What don't you understand?
They've gone under.
- And you want to stay anyway?
- Where are we going to go, Laura?
- Home.
- There's no such thing any more.
- I could get my job back at the bank.
- I could get other work here.
- Doing what?
- I'll find something.
Honey, look...
I don't want the kids to grow up in the city.
I'd like them to see the sky, hear the birds, not that noise.
I'd like them to walk home at night and not worry what's behind them.
- Am I really wrong to feel that way?
- No, of course not.
- Don't worry.
They'll think you're cool.
- Really?
Yeah.
Class, we have a brand new student in grade 8 that's just moved to the area.
Matt Turner doesn't know anyone here, so I want us all to make him welcome.
And now April will give us a grade 9 presentation of her 4-H Club project.
Jim, Josh, stop that.
This is Charlotte, a 6-month-old Toggenburg goat, who I helped birth and then disbudded at one week.
Toggenburgs are the oldest registered breed of any animal in the world.
They're light brown with white accents and are excellent milk producers.
Thank you, April.
That was a very imaginative demonstration.
I'd like to encourage the rest of you to accompany their science projects with practical demonstrations like the one April presented.
Now, if you turn in your books to chapter 17...
How are you doing, girl?
Can you believe that?
Show-and-tell with a goat?
I can't believe I live here!
You know what would happen at my old school if I put a goat on a desk?
Hey, wait up!
I'm not a dog, you know.
Are you sure this is the right way back?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Probably through those trees.
Come on, this isn't funny.
Is this the only trick you know?
Give me back my bag!
Come on, wait up, will you!
I told you, it's not funny!
Give me my bag.
You like making me chase you, don't you?
Hey, come on, quit it.
There it is.
It doesn't look like such a dump from up here.
"AC"...
That's my mom!
AC, that's my mom, Anne Collins.
How did you know?
Once we get the weeds out, we could have flowers, some geraniums...
And over here would be a great place for a vegetable garden.
- A garden?
- Yeah.
- What do you know about gardening?
- Not a thing.
Hi, Steve...
Laura.
I told you I'd hear about some work, and I have.
At the Walker ranch they're repairing all the outbuildings and the fences.
They'll furnish all the tools, you won't have to bring a thing.
- Repairing fences...
- Well, that's all there is for now.
No, I understand.
Well, at least I'll be outside.
- Your apple pie is great, Laura.
- In celebration of good old electricity.
- What is this thing?
- It looks like an old record player.
Are these old CDs?
No, sweetie, these are 45s.
Let's see if this thing works.
- Did you try plugging it in?
- Yeah.
"Proud Mary"..."Jimmy Mack"...
I used to listen to these when I was a kid.
Those records were your mom's.
She used to play them all day long.
Just like Matt with his head attachment.
I know this one.
Mom used to sing it to us.
Remember, Matt?
There are places I remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all...
What, you can't find it?
What is it?
I'm coming.
What is it, girl?
What are you looking at, girl?
It's my mom's diary.
Thanks, Lassie.
"April 23..."
"Today I got up early and rode Lucky through the high pasture,"
"all the way to the mountain pool."
It was too cold to swim, so we sat there for a while,
I forgot about the time and was almost late for school.
On Saturday, Dad let me help him split wood and showed me how to mend the goat pen and put up the new wire in the chicken coop.
Mom said, "What are you teaching her to use axe and hammer for?"
Daddy said, "So she can take the place over some day, if she wants to. "
"Maybe raise her own kids here. "
I didn't tell Mom then, but that's just what I want, have a real sheep farm some day, right here.
After all, we've got some of the best grazing land around.
Of course I'll need to get a sheepdog, I already know what kind, a collie.
I think I'll name it Lass...
Sing me the one about the mockingbird.
Oh, I think I know that one.
Hush, little baby, don't say a word
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
And if that mockingbird don't sing
Daddy's gonna buy you a diamond ring
And if that diamond ring don't shine
Daddy's gonna buy you...
something nice.
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you, too.
Lassie, believe me, you don't want to go out in that storm.
Lassie?
No, Lassie!
Good girl!
Quiet, girl.
Don't wake them up.
Come on, girl.
You're a pretty brave dog.
What happened?
- Nothing, Jen.
Go back to bed.
- She's hurt.
She's fine.
Help me dry her off.
Hey, I told you to be quiet.
Hey, I thought I told you to be quiet, too.
What did you think of the flip, Lassie?
Not bad, huh?
Are you kidding?
That was great.
Where did you learn how to do that?
- That's no big deal.
- Yeah?
You can't do it.
- How do you know, dung head?
- Because I know you're a spaz.
You're Matt, right?
"Let's all make Matt real welcome, because he doesn't know anybody here."
- Knock it off, Jim.
- What?
I'm April Porter.
This is Jim and Josh Garland.
- You're from the Collins farm, right?
- Yeah.
- What a hole!
- We like it OK.
- Can you do a back flip?
- Sure.
- Let's see.
- Yeah, maybe some other time.
- Come on, do it!
- He can't do it.
- I can do it, I just don't want to.
- Yeah, right.
He just doesn't want to.
Our dad is the biggest sheep farmer in the whole state.
My folks are going away this weekend.
Why not come over Saturday night?
- We're going to rent some cool videos.
- I don't think so, Josh.
My parents already have other plans.
Wait till you see our place.
Now this is a real farm.
Stay here, Lassie.
I'll only be a minute.
Come on in.
Make yourself at home.
You have a swimming pool in your living room.
- You like guns?
- Yeah, I guess.
Look at that.
Bolt-Action.22. It's mine.
You get all this from raising sheep?
Sure do.
"Warm, durable American wool."
- We know the motto, Jim.
- Well, he doesn't.
I'm coming, girl.
Lassie?
Where did you go?
Lassie!
There she is.
Bringing in a stray.
As good as any sheepdog.
Good girl, Lassie.
Hey, Matt...
Ever seen so many lamb chops on a hoof?
- Josh!
- April's so sensitive.
They're not pets, April.
Just wool and good eating.
I've got to go.
Bye.
- Well, I'll see you guys around.
- Yeah.
See you.
Come on, Lass!
Come on, girl.
Big city guy's going to run off with your girlfriend.
Shut up, lame-brain!
You stretch the wire, you pound in the staple and you go on to the next post.
Stretch the wire, pound in the staple, go on to the next post...
Oh, my God!
I have a question:
what does 4-H mean?
It stems from...
"Head, Heart, Hands and Health."
"Head, Heart, Hands..."
- Well, see you.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
"Twenty-five years of my life and still..."
"...
I'm trying to get up that great big hill of..."
"...hope!"
That was good.
Hey, where are you going?
Wait up!
Coyotes.
It'll be all right.
It'll be fine.
It's just sleeping.
Lassie, I don't know what to do.
I'm not a vet.
Just forget about it.
All right...
Come on, Lass...
Here.
Is April here?
It's OK, Dad.
Hi...
I was wondering if you'd come over to my house for a little while?
The thing is, I need some help.
It's in here.
- Will it be OK?
- I don't know.
Sometimes they can make it without a mother, sometimes they can't.
It just depends on the sheep.
Keep a blanket over it tonight, because it'll probably get pretty cold in here.
I'll bring you some extra formula tomorrow.
Yeah, you like that, don't you?
Yeah, you do.
I don't think it's hurt.
It just looks really hungry.
- You are from Baltimore, right?
- Yeah.
I've been there once.
It was cool.
- Thanks for coming over.
- Sure.
- I better get going home.
- Yeah.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Right.
- Matt, guess what!
- Not now, Jen.
- But guess what!
- What?
We're going home!
- Moving back?
- It's not definite, I'll know in a few days.
- What are you talking about?
- Your dad got a call about a good job.
In Baltimore.
They've been trying to reach him for a week.
That place I interviewed a month ago.
At the time, they didn't have anything.
- You don't have to take it, do you?
- No, but I need a hell of a reason not to.
- What about the job you have here?
- Mending fences at 5 dollars an hour?
Hey, what's going on?
- I thought you'd want to move back?
- Yeah, sure.
Why not?
Look, it doesn't matter to me either way.
I didn't tell Mom then, but that's just what I want to do, have a real sheep farm some day, right here.
- What do you mean, how do they do it?
- You saw their ranch.
- They make a fortune.
How?
- Well, they raise a lot of sheep.
- And that's it?
- Well, yeah...
- And they've got the best pasture.
- That's what I'm trying to say!
- Now, where is this pasture-land?
- I don't know.
Down around Greenly's, the whole high meadow.
Why?
- Well, that's their flock, right?
- Yeah.
- And this is their pasture-land, right?
- Right.
So what's that fence?
I come by every day, and there's no other fence between here and our farm.
I've seen their sheep grazing all over here, all the way up to the creek.
- All right, let's say that this is our land.
- I don't know.
Let's just say.
Somebody has put that fence here for something.
You know, raising sheep is not as easy as it looks.
- You need pens and sheepdogs...
- I've got the dog!
Lassie, go!
Round them up!
Bring them here, girl!
Good girl!
This is our boundary, right?
Our farmhouse is right here.
- I can read a plat map.
- All right, sorry.
- This is the Garlands' ranch.
- Yeah, I've seen it.
And whose land are they using?
Ours.
They've got sheep all over that pasture.
- It's the best grazing land in the area.
- If it's done right, you can make money.
300 ewes and 20 rams, by the end of next year you have 450 sheep.
- What's going on?
- Your brother just lost his mind.
You should see the Garlands' ranch...
I'm a contractor.
I don't know the first thing about farming, neither do you.
- Grandpa does.
- I'm no expert, but I know the basics.
With the animals and the construction, that's doing labour ourselves, we could probably get started for 30-35,000.
I'm sorry, Matt.
I'd be lucky to cover half of that.
If you'd be willing, I'd be glad to put up the other half.
That's very generous of you, but we couldn't ask you to do that.
Nothing generous about it.
The fact is, I'm kind of thinking about myself.
I'd sure like to have these grandkids around me.
You want to stay here?
Yeah.
Yeah, I really do.
What do you think we should do?
I wish I knew.
Come on...
- Let me try.
- OK, just don't tilt the bottle too much.
- Come on, you're drowning the thing.
- I am not.
That's enough.
That's done.
Don't worry, I've got another one.
There you go.
Well, I hope you're not driving.
Me, too.
That's the whole flock.
I brought them down from the high pasture on Friday.
So, how many is that?
That's 380 ewes and 34 rams.
380 and 34, that's just about right for the land we got.
How much?
Like I said on the phone, I don't know about this.
Sam Garland said he might be interested in the whole flock.
So are we.
What's he offering?
We talked about 57 a head for the ewes.
We'd like to offer you 60 dollars a head, Pete.
Well, 60 is fair.
- I'd say so.
- More than fair.
- But Garland was here first.
- I don't understand the problem.
We'd like the whole flock, we're offering 3 dollars more.
It's all right, Mr Jarman.
We respect your position.
I'm sure you and Sam Garland go way back, and he'd do the same for you.
I hope we didn't take up too much of your time.
Come on.
I'm sorry we couldn't work something out, Pete.
Honey!
Honey, what are you doing?
Don't worry.
He's pressuring himself more than we ever will.
Hey, hold up a minute.
The flock is yours if you can pay today.
Long ago, when the line between Good and Evil was clearly drawn twin brothers faced each other in battle.
Good was triumphant, and the Knight buried his brother.
Now, a thousand years later, the struggle continuous.
THE WANDERER
Episode 6 "CLARE"
I married Clare?
A wedding invitation.
Emilio and...
Clare.
It's sort out to Spain, isn't it?
...I want report from the section every five minutes...
Please, don't be afraid by what am I about to tell you, but...
Your daughter is alive.
I don't know much, but...
I know she's alive.
She's not hurt.
But she's not free.
She's in a... cave or a tunnel.
And how do you combine all this information?
I just know.
She's not in the open...
She's in a kind of enclosed space.
Enclosed space...?
I've got just the one for you.
Tell me what have we got here?
I've never seen anything like it.
No protest, no demand or phone calls.
He said he'd missed the wedding.
That's it.
Not another word.
Here's betting, the bride looks brilliant.
He won't make it here in time.
What do I tell you?
Brilliant.
- Oh please!
- Temper...
I hate the dress.
She mustn't marry.
Oh, now he says...?
I'm waiting years to have a found.
- You could have told me.
- "Yes of course" problems?
- I'd have killed her!
- Of course.
Now I want full gesture in special effects when he finds her again.
Far more in the romantic tradition if she's free and non of cached.
You could have stopped this earlier.
What fun is there in that?
Let's see how well she still loves who she wants love.
- They found the girl, captain.
- Alive?
- Alive.
She was in the catacombs.
- So he was right.
Think is how was he right.
Unless he was there.
- Where's the girl now?
- They're bringing her here.
I want the girl to see him.
I want to see if she recognises him and if he makes her afraid.
He makes me uneasy, I'll tell you that.
Bye-bye.
...bless our Lord this ring that Emilio puts the hand of Clare and spreading over them, declaim to us of your goods.
- I can't go on!
- What do you mean, you can't go on?
I'm sorry, father.
I can't go on.
- Clare, you're out of your mind!
- It would be wrong.
I'm...
I'm truly sorry.
Maria, you've seen me before, right?
Now I want you to tell me, if you've ever seen this man before.
He can't see you.
He can't hear you.
He's not going to hurt you.
Just tell me, if you've ever seen him before.
You're sure?
- Maybe you could help me?
- Senor?
I'm trying to identify this region.
I want to defend if that was familiar.
Is it somewhere near here?
Thing is of no idea.
I'm...
blundering around in the dark.
There's no someone to recognise.
Perhaps, if I show it to some of my colleges...
- Would you?
- Sure.
What a place...!
Beatrice, what are you doing?
I'm pig sick of being a woman!
It's so complicated being female.
You should have known any good old temper metal once we found Clare.
Give him time.
He could have loved me.
How long given to you under staying this prevent form?
- Perhaps forever.
- Silly woman.
And how do you knock neglecting your duties?
Everything is under control.
I'm sorry, sir.
But it's not familiar to anyone here.
- Well, thanks anyway.
To be a mess kind.
- You are welcome.
Clare!
She is alive again.
How could she be alive again?
You are.
Thing is hasn't happened.
Or is it yet to come.
- Did he see it, Beatrice?
- He saw it.
In your present form, Beatrice dear...
I do wish you wouldn't do that.
Force of habit.
Why bet off?
They had him in for questioning.
He found some lost child.
Now let him go.
I know all that.
Just what the planet needs...
another child.
Your twin becomes more and more predictable.
Doing good everywhere he goes.
Always had steel rod up his spine...
inclined a primness around the sphincter.
But us ... more fun, don't we?
Oh yes!
- What's the weather forecast?
- Warm and dry, senor.
As usual.
- No storms?
- Not at all.
A very good forecast.
- Gracias!
- Nada.
Now for the fun part.
Let's do something nasty that my twin could get the blame fool.
- Is that the kid?
- That's her.
Child playing with dog.
Get her right here.
Doesn't it, it's called noisy ache.
- Can you do it?
- Of course I can do it.
I'd love this one.
The little twerp new, your twin was sending her messages.
Nice one, stone!
Come on, Jame!
That's it.
Very good!
Very good...
It will all pass.
Hopefully.
- What now?
- I'm not going into a dive like that.
Forget the kid, Beatrice.
We have more important business in there.
What a fatten place.
What business?
They have been a number of unpleasant murders in this aria light.
I'm not surprised.
And a slime balls responsible are regular customers in there.
And you want me to go in there...
dressed like this?
I just wish to make you see the charming habits of these gentlemen.
I wish to provide them with their next victim.
Which could be me, if I go in there.
You'll be pleased to know that I've already selected their next victim.
The Lady Clare.
But you could call her Beatrice.
Do we know you?
No, but we know you and the type of things you love to do.
Relax.
We're not here to judge.
My credentials are impeccably little.
You like to hurt people, don't you?
- We don't have to listen to this.
- Yes you do!
We don't know what you're talking about.
Don't be shy.
We all have our little... interests.
Lovely Beatrice here for instance likes nothing more than the powerful attentions of the strong men.
Who the hell are you?
Santa Clauses.
Come to point you to that tastiest... gift.
What are they looking at?
Guess...
They said it's not gonna storm.
Help!
This is the place.
Get it after!
Aright.
Let's see...
Get back!
Come on!
- Come on, baby!
- No!
- No!
- Yes!
Yes!
After them!
Shit!
Go!
Come on!
Come on!
Get in the truck!
Come on!
I don't know where you came from, but thank God you did!
Clare!
You didn't come from anywhere, did you?
You knew!
Come on!
Come on!
- Are they going?
- Shh!
Have they gone?
We'll give 'em a minute.
My bag!
I need my bag!
Forget.
I'll get it.
Hey!
He looks like the other guy.
Of course he does.
They're twins!
Is that why we can't kill him?
I wish we could kill him!
And after him, we can do what we like with her!
Oh shit!
- They're gonna get away!
- Do it!
They can't get far!
They're still tied!
Hey, let me try that tier.
- Did you brake his leg?
- Doubt it.
I couldn't be that lucky.
- So they still could be two of them.
- Could be!
Who are they?
Entertainment my brother's arranged.
That's all the hallmarks of his sense of humour.
I don't think it's funny.
I've bet, he does.
Zachary?
How do I know his name?
Keep still!
- Who are you?
- Just stop squirming like a nail.
Hey.
Hold on.
There.
There.
Now.
Untie me!
And keep low!
I am low.
Believe me.
I'm lower far than ever.
They're gonna kill us!
Oh, I can't get this node!
Forget it!
Forget it!
We're gonna get outta here!
Here.
Try this node again.
That's it!
You, take the truck.
You take it on the road.
And you wait there.
In case they go at that way.
So far.
This has been a love wasting night.
Go!
Are they leaving?
No, I don't think so.
There must be some other way outta here.
Except we don't know where we are.
We could be stumbling around all night.
So what should we do?
- Wait till daylight and get some sleep.
- Sleep?
It's our only advantage.
It's our only advantage.
They'll be up all night.
Waiting to see if we try something.
In the morning they'll be tired that sharp.
Let's find ourselves a nest.
- That's no way I'm gonna be able to sleep.
- You'll be surprised.
Progressing nicely!
They're out there somewhere.
Our lovers rejoined.
Do you mind.
I've just eaten.
Together again in conditions of great peril...
In such an incubator how can they not rediscover the hots for each other?
I mean I'm just such a little Cupid.
What are you doing?
I was his wife.
I'm sending him my love.
- What is it?
- It's alright.
It's nothing immediate.
I saw this face in the midst of Great Cathedral.
And I turned my back on my wedding and I walked out because of this face.
Your face!
Why did I do that?
Try and get some rest.
How can I sleep?
Let me try and help.
Clare!
You will always be with me.
You've opened veins in me I never knew I had.
You'd better better return and make an honest woman of me.
Depend on it.
God keep you, Knight.
Do you think next time we might bring some staff?
Judging by the look of this, I'd say that's an excellent idea.
Get it eaten.
When was the last time I burned anything?
London, wasn't it?
1666.
I didn't mean it to spread so far.
Why haven't we got any staff here anyway?
I can't have people everywhere, Beatrice.
Sometimes I have to take advantage of what's available locally.
Well, I wish you'd recruited help for the kitchen and left that deadly stuff to me.
Set of using those two redneck crabs.
It's capable as you are, Beatrice.
I can't trust you with Clare.
- So you take two oafs of the street?
- It's called improvisation.
They served my purposes very well, those two ground boys.
Your purposes?
I thought they were our purposes.
What else do you hide from me?
Stay outta my head, Beatrice!
- Did you get the dog?
- I've got him!
But he looks mean.
Open the door!
Brutus will let us know if they come back for the car.
Okay.
Let's go and find them!
Now what?
The car.
I've got weapons there.
But first I have to leave them a note.
You're writing them a note?
We have to give them the opportunity to surrender.
They'll be handed to the police.
But at least they'll stay alive.
They're never going to surrender to us.
I have to give them the opportunity.
I don't wanna have to kill them.
With that thing?
That's the best thing we've got?
I made this.
I bet you glad that I came.
I've got to see lady.
And you always were from what I remember.
Please!
No more history lesson.
Not now.
I can't take it.
So what's next?
- Give me a glove.
- What for?
We need to gain some time.
I want them to stop.
And I want them to stop right here.
Come on!
- Let's go!
- How are they gonna see that?
Come on!
I want them dead.
Piece by piece.
He want a girl alive.
Stop waving that thing about.
They are no armed.
You are not going to mediate.
It can't work!
No-one could logically expect you to hit a barn door with that thing.
Forget logic!
Since when did logic have anything to do with this.
If we surrender...
he'd take us to the police and we can stay alive.
Can you believe this?
You hear that?
Pull it out!
Pull it out!
Jesus!
Did you see that?
- Not bad.
- Come on!
That's a boy.
Come on!
Come on!
Calm down!
Come on, stone!
Where are you when I need you?
I'm gonna need a bit of help of you.
I need to turn this fella here into a pussycat.
Come on!
Come on!
That's a good boy.
Calm down!
Calm down!
Come on!
Come on!
Yeah.
That's right.
Good.
That's it.
That's it.
Good boy!
That's it.
We're not gonna hurt you.
That's it, fella!
Good fella.
Thank you, stone!
Okay.
A love pussycat.
A sword?
- I supposed I should have known.
- Yes, you should have known.
The one I feel comfortable with.
The sword I was raised on.
It's alright.
- Come on!
- Lay down your weapons!
You'll be taken into custody, but you'll stay alive.
This is not a decision you should rush.
Think about it.
Listen...
I'm going to have to kill him.
Alright.
Alright.
But make sure it hurts.
That's far enough.
Stop!
Or I'm going to blow you away!
You'll have to do better than that.
Your life is still available.
Keep out of this now and you'll stay alive.
Right.
You're right.
I'm out of here.
Adam!
Drop it or else she's dead!
I'm warning you!
They made themselves worthless, believe me.
I do!
It's beautiful here.
This place is so stick in romance, don't you think?
And it served its purpose.
Our lovers are into soluble joint again.
- He's saying goodbye.
- Of course he's saying goodbye.
He doesn't wanna put her in danger, does he?
Still I don't think she'll be easily parted from you.
Why do you need them together?
Because Clare holds the key although she doesn't know, and she knows things that will lead him to my grave.
Will you stop sulking, Beatrice?
Let them have their moment in the sun.
Because very soon it'll be growing very dark.
The police are down there.
You'd be safe now.
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you are not.
They'd use you against me.
You'd be their greatest weapon.
- You'd be in appalling danger.
- I don't care.
I do!
I don't wanna loose you again.
I wanna keep you alive.
I have to see my parents.
They'll be frantic until they know I'm safe.
But then I'm coming after you.
I won't let you go.
- That's exactly what they want.
- It's what you want.
Goodbye, Lady Clare.
My lord.
I'll find you.
I won't let you go.

Hey, look!
It's the President!
And the Pope!
Yee-aah!
Yah!

Oh, my God!
Look!
It's disgruntled postal workers!

Wait a minute!
Give me my baby back!
Aah!
Aah!
- Frank!
Are you all right?
- I'm soaking wet.
- I'll get the talcum powder.
- No, I had a nightmare.
There was crime all around me.
I couldn't stop it.
- It was just a dream.
- You're right.
All I need is a good rest.
In the morning everything'll be fine.
(DOGS WHINE)
How's my little boy?
Getting along okay, sweetie?
As well as a heterosexual can in prison.
I don't know how much longer I can take it.
- How's Tanya?
- Tanya's the same.
Milky, creamy skin, pouting red lips, firm buttocks, ample breasts, ears you want to stick your tongue into.
Ma!
I'll get guy cramps!
Sorry.
Rocco, there's somebody here to see you.
Papshmir.
My people are very upset.
They're always upset.
They're Arab terrorists.
Ma, please.
You're supposed to be the best terrorist bomber in the world.
Stations, stores, government buildings...
The devastation in Florida.
- That was Hurricane Andrew.
- That's what they told the public.
We wanted to embarrass the United States, and you made the police look like international heroes.
A first-class job costs 5 million.
If you want to step up to the price,
I got a target that'll make City Hall look like chicken feed.
That's a big target, but why should I think anything would be different?
$5 million buys me.
- I'm breaking out of here.
- All right, but fail this time and my people won't be so forgiving.
Fail?
Show me one man who can stop me.
I used to be a renegade
I used to fool around
But I couldn't take the punishment
I had to settle down
Now I'm playing it real straight
And yes, I cut my hair...
PA:
Attention shoppers.
Be sure to check out our special on aisle 7.
It's hip to be square...

That's aisle 7.
Hey!
Give it to me!
LADY:
My purse!
Somebody help me!
THIEF:
I want the purse, lady.
LADY:
Help me!
He's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny
Hear!
Hear!
Well, we shot a lot of people together.
It's been great.
But today I retire, so if I do any shooting now, it'll have to be within the confines of my own home.
Hopefully, an intruder and not an in-law, like at my bachelor party.
Well, Ed.
- I officially give you my gun.
- Aw...
And my badge.
(WHIMPERS)
And...
Jane and I would like to keep the handcuffs as a souvenir.
- Oh, gee...
- Cheer up, Ed.
This is not goodbye.
It's just I won't ever see you again.
Oh, Frank.
LADY:
My purse!
Somebody help me!
THIEF:
Out of the way.
Lieutenant Drebin!
Frank!
Didn't you see that?
What?
Oh, yes.
Kitty litter.
Two bags for a dollar.
Great.
Order.
The jury will disregard that statement.
Continue, Counsellor.
Alimony had been set by the court.
Right, Mr Clayton?
Yes, but...
But not once have you paid alimony to my client, repeatedly defying a court order.
I lost her address.
She moved twice, I couldn't keep up.
Don't lie to me.
You're under oath.
Do you know the penalty for perjury?
(BABIES CRYING)
I'll ask that again.
Objection!
Your Honour, I... ow, ow.
Jeez!
- Counsel is leading the witness.
- Sustained.
(GAVEL POUNDS)
Sweetie, Mommy said no pounding when she's in session.
Please read the prosecution's last statement.
"Don't lie to me.
You're under oath. "
- (BURP)
- There.
"Do you know the penalty for perjury?"
That's all I have, Your Honour.
You may continue, Ms Spencer-Drebin.
Er... prosecution rests.
Defence, Ms Davis-Jacob-Steiner-Laszlo?
No further questions, Your Honour.
Court will recess until after the morning feed.
(SQUEAK)
We're gonna win this.
I can feel it.
Yes.
Of course.
I married the wrong man.
I never thought that was possible.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, nothing.
Louise, there's no such thing as the wrong man.
You just have to work at it.
Now, let's see.
Mr and Mrs Drebin, right?
Now, you two have been married for six months?
Yes.
We really appreciate you seeing us, Doctor.
You were recommended by our last therapist.
Yes, I was sorry to hear about his suicide.
You know, I feel it's important to get off on the right foot and not get caught up in blame.
Now, which one of you is impotent?
- That would be him.
- Yes, of course.
- Why don't you ask who's frigid?
- That would be him, also.
- How do you know?
You're never home.
- He resents that I work.
He has no idea what a woman wants.
You're so insensitive.
- Is this the toilet seat thing?
- It's babies, Frank.
I want to have a baby.
Whenever we make love, you get a headache.
I'm not a piece of meat, Jane.
I'm trying.
I've got ointments, lotions, creams, books, things that vibrate.
- Frank!
- Maybe it's your fault.
Have you tried sexy lingerie?
Some lacy underwear, a black teddy?
I've worn them all.
They don't work.
Oh.
Why don't you want a child?
Didn't I try to adopt that 18-year-old Korean girl?
Jane, Frank, here's what I suggest.
Make tonight a special night.
Dinner, wine, romantic music.
Put on the 24-hour Johnny Mathis station.
Just be Jane and Frank, lovers.
We haven't had a night like that in a long time.
- Not together.
- Frank?
Jane...
Having a baby is a big responsibility.
It's like being in charge of sanitation at a Haitian jail.
I'm just frightened.
Frank, let's make tonight something special.
Oh, honey, it's just that I love you so much.
My little lover sparrow.
My puppy-wuppy wover.
My little love biscuit.
My little shnooky-wookums.
My little lady cheesy puppy.
Mr and Mrs Drebin, please.
I'm diabetic.
I think you should go now.
I never thought we'd end this way.
How did you think we'd end?
I don't know.
Some other way.
Oh, Jason.
(CRYING)
(DOORBELL)
Ed!
Nordberg!
It's been a long time.
Hiya, Frank!
You look terrific!
Thank you.
The little woman got me a Thighmaster.
Where are my manners?
Come on in.
How charming!
Sit, sit.
Excuse the mess.
It's my ironing day.
I just frosted some cupcakes.
- Would you care for one?
- Oh, not just now.
Frank, we have a problem with a terrorist threat.
- Police Squad is certain...
- I'd love a cupcake.
- That coffee smells great.
- I grind my own beans.
Frank, the reason we're here is that we need your help.
It's great!
I hoped you'd like them.
Made them from scratch.
I'll just get off my feet.
We may have a lead on a suspect in the City Hall bombing attempt.
These were taken by a news photographer.
- This girl was the diversion.
- We had them enlarged.
They look familiar.
No, the pin, she's a nurse.
Can I keep this one?
We traced her to the Karlson Clinic on Myrtlewood.
- She's Tanya Peters.
- Tanya Peters?
- You know her?
- Don't you remember in the 1970s?
The big disco shoot-out.
(STAYIN'ALIVE PLAYING)
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
The music loud, the women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
But it's all right, I'm OK
You may look the other way
We can try to understand...
Ed, what's happening, my man?
Frank, we missed you last night at the fondue party.
I went to see the Village People.
They're a stone soul gas, man.
- I can dig it.
- What have we got here?
One dead disco dancer.
Bummer.
What a mindbender, huh?
We think it was a love triangle.
This is the suspect's girlfriend, Tanya Peters.
Cigarette?
Yes, I know.
Well, we'll need a statement from you down at the station.
Nordberg!
Coming, Lieutenant!
I do remember.
You were one of the first test cases for minoxidil, weren't you?
- What?
- I'm glad I could help.
Now, I've got some lamb to put in the oven.
We need a favour.
It's not that big a roast, Nordberg.
No, not that, Frank.
We need you to go undercover at the clinic.
Whoa!
I've given up police work, Ed.
You're whistling up the wrong neck of the woods.
- We're in a bind, Frank.
- What about Hedges and O'Malley?
They're in Hawaii.
Together.
Well, I can't.
Jane and I have a special evening planned.
You'll be home in time to make dinner.
I'd have to make pork chops.
Frank, think of all the crime out there.
Nobody is safe.
You'd be protecting Jane.
You'd be protecting all the Janes of the world.
And you haven't shot anybody in months.
That's true.
Funny how you miss the little things.
Might be good to feel that cold, hard steel pressed against my thigh once again.
The thrill of the chase, to be a man.
After folding the laundry, I went to the Karlson Clinic.
It's always important to have a disguise and this operation was no different.
I had no idea if Tanya would recognise me, so I slipped on a fake pair of glasses and combed my hair differently.
The plan was to get in, get information about Tanya's link with the bombing, and get out as quickly as possible.
I figured faking an old football injury would do the trick.
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see a doctor, please.
Sign in here, please.
- Do you have an appointment, Mr...
- Er, Smith.
No, I don't.
Take a number.
Six.
- What?
- Is six taken?
Does it have to be between 1 and 10?
You'll be called.
Thank you.
Mr Smith?
We've had a cancellation.
We can take you now.
Good morning, Mr Smith.
This way.
I really appreciate your seeing me like this.
I'm sure it won't take too long.
When did you notice the problem?
Uh, in the back yard with my uncle.
In the back yard with your uncle?
Yes.
When he comes over to visit, we like to go in the back yard, throw it around for a while.
What did you and your uncle find out?
I can't keep up with him.
Mine hurt, especially on the long ones.
I can't seem to straighten it out.
It has no feeling.
It's kind of numb.
I may have yanked it too much.
- If you would.
- For what?
- A sperm count.
- In here?
It's not exactly the back yard, but it'll do.
Well...

Follow me, and we'll do the necessary paperwork.
Sign these at the bottom and leave them with the nurse.
- This way, please.
- What?
- Number 17.
- Oh, no.
- A problem?
- No, no.
- This is 17.
- Have we met before?
If you'll excuse me, I'm next.
Ooh!
Aah!
Agh!
Eurgh!
- Sir?
- Aah!
Mr Smith, how are we doing?
(SHEEP BLEATS)
I've been busy.
- Do you want a videotape to help?
- Do you have Dances With Wolves?
Rocketeer?
Lady And The Tramp?
An adult movie.
Hmm...
Ooh!
Aah!
Yeow!
The tape was very entertaining.
Follow me.
Do you have Spartacus?

- What are you doing?
- Just freshening up.
You should look your best even though you're by yourself.
Are you sure we've never met?
Here's my cup.
Back to work.
- Knocking.
- Mr Smith?
- Are you okay in there?
- I could use a little help.
PA:
Dr Rosenblatt, foreplay in room 7, please.

(ROMANTIC MUSIC)
Honey, I've been waiting all day.
I'm wearing the nightgown you bought me for our honeymoon.
Tonight's going to be special.
I'm going to make love to you for hours and hours.
Wouldn't Mr Happy like that?
- Hours?
- Like our first time together.
Jane, why don't I soak in the tub for a couple of days?
Possibly a week.
You're so cute.
Let me go get the oysters and clams.
Walk my way
And a thousand violins
Begin to play
Or it might be the sound
Of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty
The moment you're near
You can say
That you're leading me on...
Here.
I'll shave your back like last time.
Jane, I really don't think we should.
I...
Frank!
What's this?
I fell on a rake.
You're lying.
Now I know why Ed's been calling.
- You're back on a case, aren't you?
- No, I swear.
It's another woman!
In your wildest dreams!
It's bad enough not having a baby, but I warned you about Police Squad, you white Anglo male!
Jane!
Ah!
Jane!
It was nothing, Jane.
I was doing Ed a small favour!
Some retirement.
I'm leaving, Frank.
I never thought you'd go back on your word.
- Aren't you being hasty?
- I don't think so.
- (DOORBELL)
- That's my cab.
I'll be at Louise's.
Oh, Frank, how could you?
We need time apart to think about us.
I'm not going to think.
Why start now?
I love you.
Look, baby, I am what I am and I do what I do.
A few guys make shoelaces, some lay sod, some make a living neutering animals.
- I'm a cop.
- Pretty speech, Frank.
But my mind is made up.
I'm leaving.
All right.
Then take this with you.
You know how my lips feel about things.
(DOORBELL)
Goodbye, Frank.
RADIO:
You're listening to KSAD, all-depressing, all the time.
Here's a dedication to Frank from Jane, who just called from a taxi.
"Frank, you lying weaseI-weenie.
"First you shoot blanks, now you're letting all the heat out... "
He said he'd never go back to police work.
Once a cop, always a cop.
- He's married to his work.
- You'll always come in second.
There was an article in Cosmo, "Why all men are pigs".
"Frank" is just another word for loser.
I never want to see him again.
I want to get as far away as possible.
We'll go to my friend's cabin by the smelting plant.
The fresh air will do you good.
Go easy.
That's your second bottle of Chanel.
You're witnessing the beginning of a new Jane Spencer-Drebin.
No more little miss perky, devoting her life to one man.
I'm out for the new me.
Let's burn rubber.
- Didn't forget anything, did you?
- I hope not.
Just calm down, ma'am.
How many bodies did you find in your pool?
Sir, killing a gang member's only an $18 fine.
Just mail it in.
Frank!
Glad you could make it!
- Welcome, buddy.
- Nordberg.
Did you find Tanya's address, Frank?
I wrote it on a hanky, and I can't remember what I did with it.
- I'm getting a bit rusty.
- It could happen to anybody.
I brought you some of Frank's never-fail fudge!
You go on about your business.
I'll stay out of your hair.
It'll be...
Frank, let me take that.
We've got a surprise for you.
It's in honour of your 30 years on the force.
Nordberg.
Oh, boy.
This is really great.
Thank you, guys.
We thought it might cheer you up.
We heard about you and Jane.
Jane, Jane.
That name will always remind me of her.
Frank, I feel really bad about all of this.
If there's anything you need.
Dr Kevorkian's home phone number?
Nordberg, put it together.
- Frank, you know we're here for you.
- Thanks, Ed.
Well, look who's here.
Hi, Frank.
Nice to see you.
- I've got that data on the bomb.
- What did you find out?
The explosive is a very fine powder.
- It tastes like...
- That's fertiliser.
Another case.
This is what I'm talking about.
We detected a high quantity of nitroglycerine.
- Can you tell us where it came from?
- I'd be glad to.
Billions of years ago, the Earth was a molten mass...
Ted, I'm talking about the powder.
We don't know about that.
Let me take that urine specimen.
We found a list of the bomber's plans at the scene.
On a hunch, we analysed the paper.
- And you got something?
- Yes.
The paper's from Statesville Prison.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
We analysed the wood fibres and found them to be from the rare Canary Island pine, which grows only in Oregon.
Contacting paper mills in that area led us to a distribution centre in Tacoma.
Unfortunately, the trail ended there.
- How'd you trace it to the prison?
- Right here on the letterhead.
After comparing handwriting of every known bomber serving a stretch in Statesville, we came up with a suspect.
Rocco Dillon.
He's masterminding the bombings from inside the prison.
There's only one way to find out where Rocco will strike next.
We have to send someone in there.
- I'll do it.
- I wouldn't feel right about that.
If Rocco thinks you're a cop, you might end up dead.
"You might end up dead" is my middle name.
What about Jane?
I don't know her middle name.
I need the action.
I'm going inside the big house.
Frank, Ed.
I think you might want to see this.
We're testing out a prototype for an anti-carjacking device.
We'll see how it works.
Get out!
Don't make me...
Argh!
We call it the Denver jockstrap.
After being retired for six months, I was finally back in action.
Faster than saying "spread 'em", I was in Statesville Prison.
I was surrounded by pimps, rapists and murderers.
It was like being in the stands at an LA Raiders game.
It was going to take all my police experience just to stay alive here.
(BELL)
After a long and generous cavity search,
I reached my destination, Maximum Security, home of some of the most violent sociopaths in the country.
And the worst of them all, Rocco Dillon.
GUARD:
All right, in here.
Ain't no prison yet could hold me.
Attica!
Attica!
Power to the brothers!
Kill whitey!
Kill whitey!
PRISONER:
Knock it off!
You're chirping loud for a new canary.
Keep flashing the big eyes and I'll rotate your jaw.
Hey!
You know who you talking to?
The man is Rocco Dillon.
- Where's your prison number?
- It's unlisted.
Just call me Nick "The Slasher" McGirk.
Look, I'm the muscle in this pen.
Just stay out of my way.
You just watch your step, McGirk.
Take it from me, this place changes a man.
Yeah?
How?
I used to be white.
I was the drummer for the Osmonds.
Screw with me, he'll make you feel pain like never before.
I know.
I remember the Osmonds.
(BELL)
- Better hit the rack, McGirk.
- In a minute.
First I'm gonna make a list of who I'm gonna kill in the next few days.
GUARD:
Lights out.
Lockdown in two minutes.
My dearest snooky wookums dumpling buns,
I miss you so much.
I haven't hurt this bad since the last time I was dumped.
I remember it well.
Her name was Gabriella.
We were supposed to be married, but on the day of our wedding, she never showed up.
I was heartbroken.
I figured she had fallen for another man, someone who could do to her what I never could.
I thought my life was over until that one glorious day.
That was the day you became my wife.
Our friends gathered to celebrate our love.
It seems like only yesterday.
We were all so overjoyed.
I remember wishing we could take everyone with us.
That was the happiest day of my life.
I remember the plans we made.
Things were going to be so perfect.
We got that housekeeper you always wanted.
Hi, Mr D. Hi, Mrs D.
And I knew that eventually our dream would come true.
One day we'd have our own Frank Drebin Jr.
ROCCO:
Shut up.
I'm trying to get some sleep.
Nah, it's no use.
She'll never come back.
(GROWLS LIKE A LION)
You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will, but what a thrill
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
I laughed at love cos I thought it was funny
You came along and moved me, honey
I changed my mind, this love is fine
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
Bend over and pick it up for me, would you, lover?
No problem.
Rocco could tell from my escapade in the shower that I was well-endowed with courage.
Now I had to get on the inside.
Like a blind man at an orgy, I was going to have to feel things out.
(WHISPERS) Tyrone, I got the escape plans right here.
Just you and me.
- Burnett wants in.
- Burnett's one of the guards!
I know, but he's unhappy here.
All right, all right.
Whatever.
Got it all worked out right here.
What's this?
Another letter from your mommy?
- That's private!
- Let's see what we have.
- Give the man back his letter.
- Buzz off, butter cheeks.
What's so special about a little letter?
Wait a minute.
An escape plan!
This is your ticket to another 20 years, Dillon.
If the warden gets one look at this...
Hey!
You call this slop?
Real slop has got chunks in it!
This is more like gruel!
And this Chateau le Blanc '68 is supposed to be served slightly chilled!
This is room temperature!
What do you think we are, animals?
ALL:
No!
What are we?
Homo sapiens?
You're right!
We are men!
We are men!
ALL:
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
Left hand blue.
Whose hand is that?
Come on, son.
You can do it.
Eat some beans!
(CLANG)
You saved my bacon, McGirk.
I'd be in solitary if you hadn't done that.
I've been watching you.
You handle yourself good.
- "Really well".
- Whatever.
I got something big on the outside.
I could use you in my gang.
- Dental plan?
- Full coverage.
- What's the caper?
- First we bust out.
Thanks to you, we still have our escape plan.
Let's have it.
- It's a good plan.
- I've had better.
Listen, I've got a fool-proof plan.
They got Tyrone.
Can't...
Can't we all just get along?
Now that Tyrone was in solitary, it was just me and Rocco.
He had to trust me.
'Shh!
Hold on.
(WHISPERING) Okay.
I convinced Rocco to dig a tunnel.
It was that or go out in a laundry truck.
The thought of lying nose down in skid marks didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.
Disposing of the dirt was a problem I solved early in the construction.
Apart from some chafing, we made good progress.
We kept digging.
Dummies gave the impression we were still in our cell.
GUARD:
Lights out.
There was more dirt than I thought.
Disposing of it was becoming tricky.
Safe!

Ninety-eight bottles of beer on the wall...
Where are you going?
- Are you thinking of Frank again?
- They're playing our song.
I understand.
Take your time.
- Hello there.
- Excuse me.
I'm hauling a load of rice cakes to Big D. Coming with me?
No.
- How about a kiss?
- No.
When a woman says no, she means yes.
- How about that kiss?
- Yes.
No?
I know your type.
Come on, baby.
We're two of a kind.
Oh, my God!
You killed him!
It was an accident.
Call the police.
Come to your senses.
You killed a man.
You're a hero to every woman.
We have to call Frank.
He'll protect us.
Frank is a man.
He'll see you locked away forever.
Jane, I want to join you, to help you kill as many men as possible.
Yipes!
Louise, do what you have to do.
I'm calling Frank.
TRUCKER:
Oh, boy, did that hurt.
Be home, Frank.
Answer the phone.
- (TELEPHONE PICKS UP)
- Frank!
ANSWERPHONE:
Hi, this is Frank.
And Jane.
BOTH:
We're the Drebins.
We're not home right now so leave a message!
FRANK:
Which button is it?
JANE:
Not that one!
(DIAL TONE)
"Tanya"?
It was another woman.
Frank wasn't lying.
"Honeymoon Bay Road. " I bet they're alone there now!
Frank!
Cell inspection.
There's been a rumour of a possible breakout.
If we suspect anyone of attempting to escape, they will be punished severely.
Once word of the escape was out, we headed for the tunnel.
The last few feet were dug on the run.
Another 47 yards would take us beyond the prison walls.
May he rest in peace, in the arms of our...
Jesus Christ!
ALL:
Amen.
FRANK:
Rocco had arranged for a car to meet us.
After making a slight adjustment we arrived at the rendezvous point, a Los Angeles city high school.
Hey, that was close.
Hey, Rocco, who's the old hag?
She take one in the face?
She's my mother.
Mrs Dillon.
Your son is a ruthless, sadistic, cold-blooded animal.
- You must be proud of him.
- I am.
I want you to meet a real square egg, Nick "The Slasher" McGirk.
There's fresh clothes in the back.
Rocco's mom was quiet.
I felt she didn't care for me coming along.
Like a midget at a urinal, I was going to have to stay on my toes.
Hey!
Stop!
Oh, Frank.
It wasn't my fault.
That cow shouldn't have been in the road.
Hurry up.
You're letting the flies in.
- What do you think?
- Great setup.
No phone, miles from the nearest town, Playboy channel.
Perfect.
Nice digs.
But I'm here for the action.
What is it?
Bank, armoured car, payroll?
You're getting a little bit too nosy, McGirk.
Relax, Ma.
- She's itching to use her new gun.
- I know the feeling.
It was Tanya.
That bathing suit was never happier.
I had only a second to admire the view.
I had to watch out.
If she made me as a cop, I'd be tonight's meat loaf.
Come here, sexy.
You're all woman.
I could tell by looking at you.
Hey, she's referring to me.
I was talking about your mother.
MOTHER:
That's no way to be walking around.
Get some clothes on.
And what are you doing in my bathing suit?
Hey, who's the stud?
Meet the newest member of our gang.
Slasher McGirk, meet Tanya Peters.
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
I smelled cop on him the minute I saw him.
I get it all the time.
It's the underwear ads.
- Are you saying you're not a cop?
- Well, yeah.
- That's good enough for me.
- Me, too.
All right.
I'm glad that's all cleared up.
Ma, why not kiss and make up?
Well, all right.
Now that's more like it.
Uh!
Ow.
FRANK:
I had to get a message to Police Squad.
This was more than I could handle.
No phone, miles from civilisation, my prospects look bleaker than a gerbil's in a bathhouse.
Who's down there?
Slasher.
Have you seen my pigeon?
- Pigeon?
What pigeon?
- What are you doing?
I'm just contemplating my next move.
Your bishop is exposed.
It's these pants.
I usually wear a fuller cut.
You're all man.
I like that in my men.
You're coming on to me big-time, sister, but we got a problem.
- You're Jewish?
- No.
You're Rocco's girl.
In my book, that chapter's called "Look, But Don't Touch".
I could have two lovers.
Kinky.
But I like my sex the way I play basketball, one-on-one, with as little dribbling as possible.
Oh, you're tense, Slasher.
Well, I could relax more if I knew about tomorrow.
You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
All I know is it's downtown and big.
That's the way I like it.
- What else?
- Just this.
What are you doing?
Thank you for the advice.
I'll try that recipe, Miss Peters.
How could you?
Just shove your tongue in as far as you can.
Oh!
Quiet.
You don't know me here.
That's a goodbye kiss, sister.
What's all this?
Who's the skirt?
Just some dizzy dame.
Probably broke down.
I'll take her to the bus depot.
Hey, she's married.
What if her husband comes looking?
- He must be a great guy.
- He breaks promises.
Look at you, traipsing all over, just to spite him.
- He left me.
- You left him.
- You should talk.
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you!
- Listen to you!
Jeez, you two, knock it off!
- You'd think you're married!
- What'll we do with her?
One thing's for sure.
There's no room for her here.
- I say we bump her off.
- Let's plug her here.
I've been on a job where I'd have given my eye teeth for a hostage.
We know women make the best hostages.
They're small, easy to move, eat less, smell nice.
Yeah, we got us an insurance policy.
Good thinking, kid.
Now, let's get some shuteye.
We got a big day ahead of us.
All right, it's rigged.
Watch the tower, Slasher.
This is what'll happen tonight.
Hey, aren't we far away?
Oh!
ROCCO:
All right, pay attention.
On that tower's a device that's gonna net us 5 million bucks.
We're gonna detonate it this evening at an event that the whole world will be watching.
- Your crowning achievement.
- It's for both of us, Ma.
All set!
Set!
Very impressive.
Heh-heh-heh-heh.
Cool.
Heh-heh-heh-heh.
Cool.
America will be brought to its knees by this terrorist act.
This will be more embarrassing to the US than Tonya Harding.

It'll be a tragedy.

The bomb's in the envelope.

And the winner is...
Argh!
Mary Lou Retton for Fatal Affair.
Yes!
Yes!

Henderson, see about this phone.
I think it's broke.
RADIO:
And now, today's lucky lotto numbers.
Get your tickets ready, 12, 22, 18, and 9.
And for his tale of genetics gone haywire in a retirement community,
Steven Spielberg, Geriatric Park.
(COUGHS)
The winner is...
RaqueI, just a second.
I just had a thought.
Christ!
This show is being seen all over the world.
If we could send good thoughts, transmit them through these cameras, to the leader of China.
Wing Wa Woo Tong, so that they might finally be nice.
Thank you.
And the winner is...
RaqueI, so many go to bed hungry in this nation.
Yet, cat food's full of tuna.
I can't help thinking each time I go to the zoo and see those porpoises crammed into tiny tanks, what a waste that is.
Butcher half of them now.
Hundreds of pounds of dolphin meat that could be fed to cats, freeing up that tuna for our nation's hungry.
- And the winner is...
- So many are cold, shivering in the night.
I say take those cats and skin them.
Use their fur to keep hundreds warm.
Jesus, Phil!
And the winner is...
Give me that!
Ohh!
- Not one move.
- That barrel's cold.
It's room temperature.
It's okay.
It's not the bomb.
Jane?
Jane?
(POPPING)
Jane?
- Silver hair.
- About 6'2".
Looked like Phil Donahue.
- That's the guy!
- Get him!
PA:
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome internationally renowned singing star, Pia Zadora.
You're walkin' along the street
Or you're at a party...
There he is!
Stop him.
Excuse me.
Isn't that snot on your shoe?
MAN:
I'll stay here.
You check the wings.
.. that this could be the start of somethin' big...
Oh, no!
Not him again?
Please, God.
Who knows what's written in that magic book?
But when a lover you discover
At the gate, my friend
Invite him in without a second look
You're watchin' the sun come up
Or counting' your...
Grab him!
I'm Ed Hocken.
This is Officer Nordberg.
- We're here to prevent a disaster.
- You're too late.
You're watchin' the sun...
Frank!
Or counting' your money
Or else in a dim cafe
You're ordering' wine
Then suddenly there he is
You want to be where he is...
Come on, Nordberg.
We've got to get Frank.
.. the start of somethin'
This could be the heart of somethin'
This could be the start of somethin'
Big
Ohh!
Jane!
Jane!
I knew I'd bump into you.
I want answers, cherry cakes.
- I love you.
- Wrong answer.
I dropped out of the sap of the month club.
Listen, you've got one last chance.
And I don't mean a major league baseball Steve Howe last chance.
- Where is Jane?
- I don't know.
- Where's the bomb?
- In the Best Picture envelope.
Mr Drebin, I want to go straight.
I'm tired of the lies.
Kiss me.
Please kiss me.
I've never kissed lips so innocent, so pure.
He looked like Phil Donahue, white hair...
- That's the guy!
- I'll get him.
PA:
Ladies and gentlemen, to present the Best Picture award, two most distinguished actors,
Olympia Dukakis and James Earl Jones.
Lord, what's that?
Looks like Phil Donahue throwing up in a tuba.
I don't think we should have Phil Donahue back next year.
Thank you.
Good evening.
It's a privilege for us to present the final award...
We've been worried about you.
Where's Rocco?
Where's Tanya?
- Sit down.
Take it easy.
- Thank God you're all right.
Indecent Instincts and Sawdust And Mildew.
Every one of these movies was a box office hit, except for one.
- What's that?
- The Best Picture award.
My money's on Sawdust And Mildew.
Olympia, would you do the honours?
Oh, my God!
That's the one!
The award for this year's Best Picture goes to...
Wait!
Oh!
Sorry about this.
Loved you in Coneheads.
You, too.
Let me open this.
(BEEPING)
It's the bomb!
Freeze and nobody gets hurt!
Well, from now on.
Back in your seats, you little weasels!
This programme's been interrupted.
Don't panic.
Stay with it.
Camera 2, move in on the old lady.
Better move back.
- Don't move!
- MA:
Now, pay attention!
I don't want to kill nobody unless I have to.
Drop your guns and kick them over here.
That bomb belongs to me.
Hand it over, Drebin.
You want to kill him, Ma?
Blink and I start shooting.
FRANK:
Give me that gun!
- Oh, my God!
- I'm not falling for that, sister.
I'm not well!
Get this stupid thing off me!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Ohh!
- Ma!
- She's a goner, Rocco.
Dead.
Then that's it.
I'm coming with you, Ma!
Pull out the bomb or I'll shoot the dame.
All right.
I'll do what you say.
- Frank!
- Don't harm her.
You pull out the bomb and you'll kill me anyway.
- Yeah.
No dice!
- Then I'll plug her.
- Shoot her, I'll empty the envelope.
- Frank, think about it.
It's all right.
You'll be dead.
Then you'll kill everyone here.
Yeah.
I'll shoot if you don't do as I say.
Jane?
I'd be safe, so would everyone else.
- But you'd be dead.
- This is complicated, Rocco.
Logically, you're psychotic, so you have the envelope, I'll have the gun.
- Frank!
- I know what I'm doing.
All right!
Here's your Best Picture!
In front of the world, this place is going up.
Well, if I'm going out, I'm going out happy.
Wait.
Before we're all blown up, can I get my underwear out of my crack?
- I got to go comfortable.
- Okay, but that's it.
- Give it up, Rocco.
You're history.
- Look, George Hamilton!
Come and get me, Drebin!
Throw me a gun!
Get rid of the bomb!
Hold on, sweetheart.
Frank, help!
- Frank.
- I know what I'm doing.
JANE:
I hate heights!
Ohh!
Oh, no!
Move it, sister!
Screw the commercials!
All right, copper, you killed my ma!
I'm taking the dame away from you.
You hear me, copper?
One push and Mrs Drebin is linoleum.
Get a camera up there.
This could be my best work.
Any last words before I throw you off?
- Yes.
Don't do it.
- Anything else?
Frank, I love you.
I want the world to know you're the perfect man.
Frank, I hope you can hear me.
They said I couldn't do drama.
I was wrong.
Taking you away from Police Squad was a mistake.
I know now that's why you couldn't perform decent sex.
I realise that now, and other things.
Everything's under control.
Nobody move!
Any vibration may set this thing off.
Frank, I've learned my lesson.
And though it may be too late for me,
I want all you ladies to remember something.
Don't ever take your men for granted, because good men don't just fall out of the sky.
Aah!
He's caught up in the cable!
Do something!
I'm coming, Ma!
Rocco?
Papshmir?
Jane...
- I never want us to be apart again.
- Oh, Frank!
You like me.
You really like me!
- Frank, slow down!
- Hurry up!
Relax.
There's time.
- You got the camcorder?
- Here.
Which room?
Delivery room.
This must be it.
Jane, I'm here.
Frank is here.
Push!
Here it comes now.
Breathe, honey.
Breathe, Jane.
One more push.
That's it.
Congratulations, Dad.
It's a boy!
Nordberg!
You come back here!
- Frank, it's a boy.
- I know!
You're walkin' along the street
Or you're at a party
Or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig
You're lookin' in someone's eyes
You suddenly realise
That this could be the start of somethin' big
There's no controlling' the unrolling' of your fate, my friend
Who knows what's written in that magic book?
But when a lover you discover
At the gate, my friend
Invite him in without a second look
You're watchin' the sun come up
Or counting' your money
Or else in a dim cafe
You're ordering' wine
Then suddenly, there he is
You want to be where he is
And this must be the start of somethin'
This could be the heart of somethin'
This could be the start of somethin' big
You're watchin' the sun come up
Or counting' your money
Or else in a dim cafe
You're ordering' wine
Then suddenly there he is
You want to be where he is
And this could be the start of somethin'
This could be the heart of somethin'
This could be the start of somethin'
Big
(Clock chiming)
(Baby crying)
(Woman) Hey, look!
It's the President!
And the Pope!
Yee-aah!
Yah!
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la!
(Man) Oh, my God!
Look!
It's disgruntled postal workers!
(Click)
Wait a minute!
Give me my baby back!
Aah!
Aah!
- Frank!
Frank, are you all right?
- I'm soaking wet.
- I'll get the talcum powder.
- No, I had a nightmare.
There was crime all around me.
I couldn't stop it.
- it was a dream.
- You're right.
All I need is a good rest.
in the morning everything'll be fine.
(Dogs whine)
How's my little boy?
Getting along OK, sweetie?
As well as a heterosexual can in prison.
I don't know how much longer I can take it.
- How's Tanya?
- Tanya's the same.
Milky, creamy skin, pouting red lips, firm buttocks, ample breasts, ears you want to stick your tongue into.
Ma!
I'll get guy cramps!
Sorry.
Rocco, there's somebody here to see you.
Papshmir.
My people are very upset.
They're always upset.
They're Arab terrorists.
Ma, please.
You're supposed to be the best terrorist bomber in the world.
Stations, stores, government buildings...
The devastation in Florida.
- That was Hurricane Andrew.
- That's what they told the public.
We wanted to embarrass the United States, and you made the police look like international heroes.
A first-class job costs five million.
If you want to step up to the price, I got a target that'll make City Hall look like chicken feed.
That's a big target, but why should I think anything would be different?
Cos $5 million buys me.
I'm breaking out of here.
All right, but fail this time and my people won't be so forgiving.
Fail?
Show me one man who can stop me.
# l used to be a renegade # l used to fool around

# He's a jolly good fellow

Hear!
Well...
We shot a lot of people together.
It's been great.
But today I retire, so if I do any shooting now, it'll have to be within the confines of my own home.
Hopefully, an intruder and not an in-law, like at my bachelor party.
Well, Ed.
- l officially give you my gun.
- Aw...
- And...my badge.
- (Whimpers)
- And, uh...
Jane and I would like to keep the handcuffs as a souvenir.
- Oh, gee...
- Cheer up, Ed.
This is not goodbye.
It's just I won't ever see you again.
Oh, Frank.
(Lady) My purse!
Somebody help me!
(Thief) Out of the way.
Lieutenant Drebin!
Frank!
- Didn't you see that?
- What?
Oh, yes.
Kitty litter.
Two bags for a dollar.
Great.
'Order.
The jury will disregard that statement.
Continue, Counsellor.'
Alimony had been set by the court.
Right, Mr Clayton?
Yes, but...
But not once have you paid alimony to my client, repeatedly defying a court order.
I lost her address.
She moved twice, I couldn't keep up.
Don't lie to me.
You're under oath.
Do you know the penalty for perjury?
(Babies crying)
I'll ask that again.
Objection!
Your Honour, I...ow, ow.
Jeez!
- Counsel is leading the witness.
- Sustained.
(Gavel pounds)
Sweetie, mommy said no pounding when she's in session.
Please read the prosecution's last statement.
"Don't lie to me.
You're under oath."
- (Burp)
- There.
"Do you know the penalty for perjury?"
That's all I have, Your Honour.
You may continue, Ms Spencer-Drebin.
Er...prosecution rests.
Defence, Ms Davis-Jacob-Steiner-Laszlo?
No further questions, Your Honour.
Court will recess until after the morning feed.
(Squeak)
We're gonna win this. I can feel it.
Yes.
Of course.
I married the wrong man.
I never thought that was possible.
- l beg your pardon?
- Oh, nothing.
Louise, there's no such thing as the wrong man.
You just have to work at it.
Now, let's see.
Mr and Mrs Drebin, right?
Now, you two have been married... for six months?
Yes.
We really appreciate you seeing us, Doctor.
You were recommended by our last therapist.
Yes, I was sorry to hear about his suicide.
You know, I feel it's important to get off on the right foot and not get caught up in blame.
Now, which one of you is impotent?
- That would be him.
- Yes, of course.
- Why don't you ask who's frigid?
- That would be him, also.
- How do you know?
You're never home.
- He resents that I work.
He has no idea what a woman wants.
You're so insensitive.
- is this the toilet seat thing?
- It's babies, Frank.
I want to have a baby.
Whenever we make love, you get a headache.
I'm not a piece of meat, Jane.
I'm trying.
I've got ointments, lotions, creams, books, things that vibrate.
- Frank!
- Maybe it's your fault.
Have you tried sexy lingerie?
Some lacy underwear, a black teddy?
I've worn them all.
They don't work.
Oh.
Why don't you want a child?
Didn't I try to adopt that 18-year-old Korean girl?
Jane, Frank, here's what I suggest.
Make tonight a special night.
Dinner, wine, romantic music.
Put on the 24-hour Johnny Mathis station.
Just be Jane and Frank, lovers.
We haven't had a night like that in... in a long time.
- Not together.
- Frank?
Jane...
Having a baby is a big responsibility.
It's like being in charge of sanitation at a Haitian jail.
I'm just frightened.
Frank, let's make tonight something special.
Oh, honey, it's just that I love you so much.
My little lover sparrow.
My...puppy-wuppy wover.
My little love biscuit.
My little shnooky-wookums.
My little lady cheesy puppy.
Mr and Mrs Drebin, please.
I'm diabetic. I think you should go now.
'l never thought we'd end this way.'
'How did you think we'd end?
' 'l don't know.
'Some other way.'
'Oh, Jason.'
(Crying)
(Doorbell)
Ed!
Nordberg!
It's been a long time.
Hiya, Frank!
You look terrific!
Thank you.
The little woman got me a Thighmaster.
Where are my manners?
Come on in.
How charming!
Sit, sit.
Excuse the mess.
It's my ironing day.
I just frosted some cupcakes.
- Would you care for one?
- Oh, not just now.
Frank, we have a problem with a terrorist threat.
- Police Squad is certain...
- I'd love a cupcake.
- That coffee smells great.
- l grind my own beans.
Frank, the reason we're here is that we need your help.
It's great!
I hoped you'd like them.
Made them from scratch.
I'll just get off my feet.
We may have a lead on a suspect in the City Hall bombing attempt.
These were taken by a news photographer.
- This girl was the diversion.
- We had them enlarged.
- They look familiar.
- No, the pin, she's a nurse.
Can I keep this one?
We traced her to the Karlson Clinic on Myrtlewood.
- She's Tanya Peters.
- Tanya Peters?
- You know her?
- Don't you remember in the 1970s?
The big disco shoot-out.
(# The Bee Gees: "Stayin' Alive")
# Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
# I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
# The music loud, the women warm
# I've been kicked around since I was born
# But it's all right, I'm OK
# You may look the other way
# We can try to understand... #
Ed, what's happenin', my man?
Frank, we missed you last night at the fondue party.
I went to see the Village People.
They're a stone soul gas, man.
- l can dig it.
- What have we got here?
One dead disco dancer.
Bummer.
What a mindbender, huh?
We think it was a love triangle.
This is the suspect's girlfriend, Tanya Peters.
Cigarette?
Yes, I know.
Well...we'll need a statement from you down at the station.
Nordberg!
Coming, Lieutenant!
# Somebody help me
# I'm stayin' alive... # l do remember.
You were one of the first test cases for monoxodyl, weren't you?
- What?
- I'm glad I could help.
Now, I've got some lamb to put in the oven.
We need a favour.
It's not that big a roast, Nordberg.
No, not that, Frank.
We need you to go undercover at the clinic.
Whoa!
I've given up police work, Ed.
You're whistling up the wrong neck of the woods.
- We're in a bind, Frank.
- What about Hedges and O'Malley?
They're in Hawaii.
Together.
Well, I can't.
Jane and I have a special evening planned.
You'll be home in time to make dinner.
I'd have to make pork chops.
Frank, think of all the crime out there.
Nobody is safe.
You'd be protecting Jane.
You'd be protecting all the Janes of the world.
And you haven't shot anybody in months.
That's true.
Funny how you miss the little things.
Might be good to feel that cold, hard steel pressed against my thigh once again.
The thrill of the chase, to be a man.
'After folding the laundry, I went to the Karlson Clinic.
'It's always important to have a disguise.
'and this operation was no different.
'l had no idea if Tanya would recognise me, 'so I slipped on a fake pair of glasses 'and combed my hair differently.
'The plan was to get in, 'get information about Tanya's link with the bombing, 'and get out as quickly as possible.
'l figured faking an old football injury would do the trick.'
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see a doctor, please.
Sign in here, please.
- Do you have an appointment, Mr...?
- Er, Smith.
No, I don't.
Take a number.
Six.
- What?
- is six taken?
Does it have to be between 1 and 10?
You'll be called.
Thank you.
Mr Smith?
We've had a cancellation.
We can take you now.
Good morning, Mr Smith.
This way.
I really appreciate your seeing me like this.
I'm sure it won't take too long.
When did you notice the problem?
Uh, in the back yard with my uncle.
in the back yard with your uncle?
Yes.
When he comes over to visit, we like to go in the back yard, throw it around for a while.
What did you and your uncle find out?
I can't keep up with him.
Mine hurt, especially on the long ones.
I can't seem to straighten it out.
it has no feeling.
It's kind of numb.
I may have yanked it too much.
- lf you would.
- For what?
- A sperm count.
- in here?
It's not exactly the back yard, but it'll do.
Well.
(Wip)
(Shouting and yelping)
(Glass breaking)
(Wip)
Follow me, and we'll do the necessary paperwork.
Sign these at the bottom and leave them with the nurse.
- This way, please.
- What?
- Number 1 7.
- Oh, no.
- A problem?
- No, no.
- This is 1 7.
- Have we met before?
If you'll excuse me, I'm next.
Ooh!
Aah!
Agh!
Eurgh!
- Sir?
- Aah!
Mr Smith, how are we doing?
(Sheep bleats)
I've been busy.
- Do you want a videotape to help?
- Do you have "Dances With Wolves"?
"Rocketeer"? "Lady And The Tramp"?
An adult movie.
Hmm...
Ooh!
Aah!
Yeow!
The tape was very entertaining.
Follow me.
Do you have "Spartacus"?
(PA) 'Maintenance.
Cleanup, room 7.
'Maintenance.
Cleanup, room 7.
Stat.'
- What are you doing?
- Just freshening up.
You should look your best even though you're by yourself.
Are you sure we've never met?
Oh, here's my cup.
Back to work.
- (Knocking)
- Mr Smith?
- Are you OK in there?
- l could use a little help.
(PA) 'Dr Rosenblatt, foreplay in room 7, please.
'Dr Rosenblatt.'
(Romantic music)
Honey...
I've been waiting all day.
I'm wearing the nightgown you bought me for our honeymoon.
Tonight's going to be special.
I'm going to make love to you for hours and hours.
Wouldn't Mr Happy like that?
- Hours?
- Like our first time together.
Jane, why don't I soak in the tub for a couple of days?
Possibly a week.
You're so cute.
Let me go get the oysters and clams.
# Walk my way
# And a thousand violins
# Begin to play
# Or it might be the sound
# Of your hello
# That music I hear # l get misty
# The moment you're near
# You can say
# That you're leading me on... #
Here.
I'll shave your back like last time.
Jane, I really don't think we should. I...
Frank!
What's this?
I...fell on a rake.
You're lying.
Now I know why Ed's been calling.
- You're back on a case, aren't you?
- No, I swear.
It's another woman!
in your wildest dreams!
It's bad enough not having a baby, but I warned you about Police Squad, you white Anglo male!
Jane!
Ah!
Jane!
it was nothing, Jane.
I was doing Ed a small favour!
Some retirement.
I'm leaving, Frank.
I never thought you'd go back on your word.
- Aren't you being hasty?
- l don't think so.
- (Doorbell)
- That's my cab.
I'll be at Louise's.
Oh, Frank, how could you?
We need time apart to think about us.
I'm not going to think.
Why start now?
I love you.
Look, baby, I am what I am, and I do what I do.
A few guys make shoelaces, some lay sod, some make a living neutering animals.
- I'm a cop.
- Pretty speech, Frank.
But my mind is made up.
I'm leaving.
All right.
Then take this with you.
You know how my lips feel about things.
(Doorbell)
Goodbye, Frank.
(Radio) 'You're listening to K-SAD, all-depressing, all the time.
'Here's a dedication to Frank from Jane, 'who just called from a taxi.
"'Frank, you lying weasel-weenie.
"'First you shoot blanks, now you're letting all the heat out..."'
He said he'd never go back to police work.
Once a cop, always a cop.
- He's married to his work.
- You'll always come in second.
There was an article in Cosmo - "Why all men are pigs".
"Frank" is just another word for loser.
I never want to see him again.
I want to get as far away as possible.
We'll go to my friend's cabin by the smelting plant.
The fresh air will do you good.
Go easy.
That's your second bottle of Chanel.
You're witnessing the beginning of a new Jane Spencer-Drebin.
No more little miss perky, devoting her life to one man.
I'm out for the new me.
Let's burn rubber.
- Didn't forget anything, did you?
- l hope not.
Just calm down, ma'am.
How many bodies did you find in your pool?
Sir, killing a gang member's only an $18 fine.
Just mail it in.
Frank!
Glad you could make it!
- Welcome, buddy.
- Nordberg.
Did you find Tanya's address, Frank?
I wrote it on a hanky, and I can't remember what I did with it.
- I'm getting a bit rusty.
- it could happen to anybody.
I brought you some of Frank's never-fail fudge!
You go on about your business.
I'll stay out of your hair.
it'll be...
Frank, let me take that.
We've got a surprise for you.
It's in honor of your thirty years on the force.
Nordberg.
Oh, boy.
This is really great.
Thank you, guys.
We thought it might cheer you up.
We heard about you and Jane.
Jane, Jane.
That name will always remind me of her.
Frank, I feel really bad about all of this.
If there's anything you need.
Dr Kevorkian's home phone number?
Nordberg, put it together.
- Frank, you know we're here for you.
- Thanks, Ed.
- Well, look who's here.
- Hi, Frank.
Nice to see you.
- I've got that data on the bomb.
- What did you find out?
The explosive is a very fine powder.
- it tastes like...
- That's fertilizer.
Another case.
This is what I'm talking about.
We detected a high quantity of nitroglycerine.
- Can you tell us where it came from?
- I'd be glad to.
Billions of years ago, the Earth was a molten mass...
Ted, I'm talking about the powder.
We don't know about that.
Let me take that urine specimen.
We found a list of the bomber's plans at the scene.
On a hunch, we analyzed the paper.
- And you got something?
- Yes.
The paper's from Statesville Prison.
Are you sure?
We analyzed the wood fibres and found them to be from the rare Canary island pine, which grows only in Oregon.
Contacting paper mills in that area led us to a distribution centre in Tacoma.
Unfortunately, the trail ended there.
- How'd you trace it to the prison?
- Right here on the letterhead.
After comparing handwriting of every known bomber serving a stretch in Statesville, we came up with a suspect - Rocco Dillon.
He's masterminding the bombings from inside the prison.
There's only one way to find out where Rocco will strike next.
We have to send someone in there.
- I'll do it.
- l wouldn't feel right about that.
If Rocco thinks you're a cop, you might end up dead.
"You might end up dead" is my middle name.
What about Jane?
I don't know her middle name.
I need the action.
I'm going inside the big house.
Frank, Ed.
I think you might want to see this.
We're testing out a prototype for an anti-carjacking device.
We'll see how it works.
- NO!
- Get out!
Don't make me...
Argh!
We call it the Denver jockstrap.
'After being retired for six months, I was finally back in action.
'Faster than saying "spread 'em", I was in Statesville Prison.
'l was surrounded by pimps, rapists and murderers.
'it was like being in the stands at an LA Raiders game.
'it was going to take all my police experience just to stay alive here.'
(Bell)
'After a long and generous cavity search, 'l reached my destination, Maximum Security - 'home of some of the most violent sociopaths in the country.
'And the worst of them all, Rocco Dillon.'
(Guard) All right, in here.
Ain't no prison yet could hold me.
Attica!
Attica!
Power to the brothers!
Kill whitey!
Kill whitey!
(Prisoner) Knock it off!
You're chirping loud for a new canary.
Keep flashing the big eyes, and I'll rotate your jaw.
Hey!
You know who you talking to?
The man is Rocco Dillon.
- Where's your prison number?
- It's unlisted.
Just call me Nick "The Slasher" McGirk.
Look, I'm the muscle in this pen.
Just stay out of my way.
You just watch your step, McGirk.
Take it from me, this place changes a man.
Yeah?
How?
I used to be white.
I was the drummer for the Osmonds.
Screw with me, he'll make you feel pain like never before.
I know. I remember the Osmonds.
(Bell)
- Better hit the rack, McGirk.
- in a minute.
First I'm gonna make a list of who I'm gonna kill in the next few days.
(Guard) Lights out.
Lockdown in two minutes.
'My dearest snooky wookums dumpling buns, 'l miss you so much.
'l haven't hurt this bad since the last time I was dumped.
'l remember it well.
Her name was Gabriella.
'We were supposed to be married, 'but on the day of our wedding, she never showed up.
'l was heartbroken. I figured she had fallen for another man, 'someone who could do to her what I never could.
'l thought my life was over until that one glorious day.
'That was the day you became my wife.
'Our friends gathered to celebrate our love.
'it seems like only yesterday.
'We were all so overjoyed.
'l remember wishing we could take everyone with us.
'That was the happiest day of my life.
'l remember the plans we made.
Things were going to be so perfect.
'We got that housekeeper you always wanted.'
Hi, Mr D. Hi, Mrs D.
'And I knew that eventually our dream would come true.
'One day we'd have our own Frank Drebin Jr.'
(Rocco) Shut up.
I'm trying to get some sleep.
'Nah, it's no use.
She'll never come back.'
(Growls like a lion)
# You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
# Too much love drives a man insane
# You broke my will, but what a thrill
# Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
# l laughed at love cos l thought it was funny
# You came along and moved me, honey # l changed my mind, this love is fine
# Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
#
Bend over and pick it up for me, would you, lover?
No problem.
'Rocco could tell from my escapade in the shower 'that I was well-endowed with courage.
'Now I had to get on the inside.
'Like a blind man at an orgy, I was going to have to feel things out.'
(Whispers) Tyrone, I got the escape plans right here.
Just you and me.
- Burnett wants in.
- Burnett's one of the guards!
I know, but he's unhappy here.
All right, all right.
Whatever.
Got it all worked out right here.
What's this?
Another letter from your mommy?
- That's private!
- Let's see what we have.
- Give the man back his letter.
- Buzz off, butter cheeks.
What's so special about a little letter?
Wait a minute...
An escape plan!
This is your ticket to another twenty years, Dillon.
If the warden gets one look at this...
Hey!
You call this slop?
Real slop has got chunks in it!
This is more like gruel!
And this Chateau le Blanc '68 is supposed to be served slightly chilled!
This is room temperature!
What do you think we are, animals?
(All) No!
What are we?
Homo sapiens?
You're right!
We are men!
We are men!
(All) We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
Left hand blue.
Whose hand is that?
Come on, son.
You can do it.
Eat some beans!
(Clang)
You saved my bacon, McGirk.
I'd be in solitary if you hadn't done that.
I've been watching you.
You handle yourself good.
- "Really well".
- Whatever.
I got something big on the outside.
I could use you in my gang.
- Dental plan?
- Full coverage.
- What's the caper?
- First we bust out.
Thanks to you, we still have our escape plan.
Let's have it.
- It's a good plan.
- I've had better.
Listen, I've got a foolproof plan.
They got Tyrone.
Can't...
Can't we all just get along?
'Now that Tyrone was in solitary, it was just me and Rocco.
'He had to trust me...
'Shh!
Hold on.
(Whispering) 'OK.
'l convinced Rocco to dig a tunnel.
'it was that or go out in a laundry truck.
'The thought of lying nose down in skidmarks 'didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.
'Disposing of the dirt was a problem I solved 'early in the construction.
'Apart from some chafing, we made good progress.
'We kept digging.
'Dummies gave the impression we were still in our cell.'
(Guard) Lights out.
'There was more dirt than I thought.
Disposing of it was becoming tricky.'
Safe!

Where are you going?
- Are you thinking of Frank again?
- They're playing our song.
I understand.
Take your time.
- Hello there.
- Excuse me.
I'm hauling a load of rice cakes to Big D. Coming with me?
No.
- How about a kiss?
- No.
When a woman says no, she means yes.
- How about that kiss?
- Yes.
No?
I know your type.
Come on, baby.
We're two of a kind.
Oh, my God!
You killed him!
it was an accident.
Call the police.
Come to your senses.
You killed a man.
You're a hero to every woman.
We have to call Frank.
He'll protect us.
Frank is a man.
He'll see you locked away forever.
Jane, I want to join you, to help you kill as many men as possible.
Yipes!
Louise, do what you have to do.
I'm calling Frank.
(Trucker) Oh, boy, did that hurt.
Be home, Frank.
Answer the phone.
- (Telephone picks up)
- Frank!
(Answer phone) 'Hi, this is Frank and Jane.
(Both) 'We're the Drebins.
We're not home right now so leave a message!
(Frank) 'Which button is it?
' (Jane) 'Not that one!
'
(Dial tone)
Tanya?
it WAS another woman.
Frank wasn't lying.
Honeymoon Bay Road.
I bet they're alone there now!
Frank!
Cell inspection.
There's been a rumour of a possible breakout.
If we suspect anyone of attempting to escape, they will be punished severely.
'Once word of the escape was out, we headed for the tunnel.
'The last few feet were dug on the run.
'Another forty-seven yards would take us beyond the prison walls.'
May he rest in peace, in the arms of our...
Jesus Christ!
(All) Amen.
(Frank) 'Rocco had arranged for a car to meet us.
'After making a slight adjustment 'we arrived at the rendezvous point - a Los Angeles city high school.
Hey, that was close.
Hey, Rocco, who's the old hag?
She take one in the face?
She's my mother.
Mrs Dillon.
Your son is a ruthless, sadistic, cold-blooded animal.
- You must be proud of him.
- l am.
I want you to meet a real square egg,
Nick "The Slasher" McGirk.
There's fresh clothes in the back.
'Rocco's mom was quiet. I felt she didn't care for me coming along.
'Like a midget at a urinal, 'l was going to have to stay on my toes.'
Hey!
Stop!
Oh, Frank.
it wasn't my fault.
That cow shouldn't have been in the road.
Hurry up.
You're letting the flies in.
- What do you think?
- Great setup.
No phone, miles from the nearest town, Playboy channel - perfect.
Nice digs.
But I'm here for the action.
What is it?
Bank, armored car, payroll?
You're getting a little bit too nosy, McGirk.
Relax, Ma.
- She's itching to use her new gun.
- l know the feeling.
'it was Tanya.
That bathing suit was never happier.
'l had only a second to admire the view. I had to watch out.
'lf she made me as a cop, I'd be tonight's meat loaf.'
Come here, sexy.
You're all woman.
I could tell by looking at you.
Hey, she's referring to me.
I was talking about your mother.
(Mother) That's no way to be walking around.
Get some clothes on.
And what are you doing in my bathing suit?
Hey, who's the stud?
Meet the newest member of our gang.
Slasher McGirk, meet Tanya Peters.
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
I smelled cop on him the minute I saw him.
I get it all the time.
It's the underwear ads.
- Are you saying you're not a cop?
- Well, yeah.
- That's good enough for me.
- Me, too.
All right.
I'm glad that's all cleared up.
Ma, why not kiss and make up?
Well, all right.
Now that's more like it.
Uh!
Ow.
(Frank) 'l had to get a message to Police Squad.
'This was more than I could handle.
'No phone, miles from civilization, 'my prospects look bleaker than a gerbil's in a bat house.'
Who's down there?
Slasher...
Have you seen my pigeon?
- Pigeon?
What pigeon?
- What are you doing?
I'm...just contemplating my next move.
Your bishop is exposed.
It's these pants.
I usually wear a fuller cut.
You're all man.
I like that in my men.
You're coming on to me big-time, sister, but we got a problem.
- You're Jewish?
- No.
You're Rocco's girl.
in my book, that chapter's called, "Look, but don't touch."
I could have two lovers.
Kinky.
But I like my sex the way I play basketball - one-on-one and with as little dribbling as possible.
Oh, you're tense, Slasher.
Well, I could relax more if I knew about tomorrow.
You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
All I know is it's downtown and...big.
That's the way I like it.
- What else?
- Just this.
What are you doing?
Thank you for the advice.
I'll try that recipe, Miss Peters.
- How could you?
- Shove your tongue down his throat.
Oh!
Quiet.
You don't know me here.
That's a goodbye kiss, sister.
What's all this?
Who's the skirt?
Just some dizzy dame.
Probably broke down.
I'll take her to the bus depot.
Hey, she's married.
What if her husband comes looking?
- He must be a great guy.
- He breaks promises.
Look at you, traipsing all over, just to spite him.
- He left me.
- You left him.
- You should talk.
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you!
- Listen to you!
Jeez, you two, knock it off!
- You'd think you're married!
- What'll we do with her?
One thing's for sure.
There's no room for her here.
- l say we bump her off.
- Let's plug her here.
I've been on a job where I'd have given my eye teeth for a hostage.
We know women make the best hostages.
They're small, easy to move, eat less, smell nice.
Yeah, we got us an insurance policy.
Good thinking, kid.
Now, let's get some shuteye.
We got a big day ahead of us.
All right, it's rigged.
Watch the tower, Slasher.
This is what'll happen tonight.
Hey, aren't we far away?
Oh!
(Rocco) All right, pay attention.
On that tower's a device that's gonna net us five million bucks.
We're gonna detonate it this evening at an event that the whole world will be watching.
- Your crowning achievement.
- It's for both of us, Ma.
All set!
Set!
Very impressive.
Heh-heh-heh-heh.
Cool.
Heh-heh-heh-heh.
Cool.
America will be brought to its knees by this terrorist act.
This will be more embarrassing to the US than Tonya Harding.
We're almost there. I don't wanna miss this.
Regards to Mrs Khadafi.
Tell her thanks for the cookies.

I'll meet you and Ma round back in ten minutes.
Got the passes?
If we pull this off, it's five million big ones.
Not bad!
- What's going to happen to me?
- l have an idea.
Right, Slasher.
You know what to do.
Check the tyres and fluid levels.
No, you muffin head, the dame.
We hit trouble, she's a bullet shield.

That's Frank at the Academy Awards.

- Nordberg!
That's where Rocco is going to strike next.
He's planning to blow up the Academy Awards.
- We've got to go.
- We're not invited.
We're cops.
It's for you.
Nordberg, Police Squad.
Hello?
Hello?

I think it's broke.

Raquel, just a second.
I just had a thought.

If we could send good thoughts, transmit them through these cameras, to the leader of China...
Wing Wa Woo Tong... so that they might finally...be nice.
Thank you.
And the winner is...
Raquel, so many go to bed hungry in this nation.
Yet, cat food's full of tuna.
I can't help thinking each time I go to the zoo and see those porpoises crammed into tiny tanks, what a waste that is.
Butcher half of them now.
Hundreds of pounds of dolphin meat that could be fed to cats, freeing up that tuna for our nation's hungry.
- And the winner is...
- So many are...cold, shivering in the night.
I say take those cats and skin them.
Use their fur to keep hundreds warm.
Jesus, Phil!
And the winner is...
Give me that!
Ohh!
- Not one move.

It's room temperature.
It's OK.

Jane!
I knew I'd bump into you.
I want answers, cherry cakes.
- l love you.
- Wrong answer.
I dropped out of the sap of the month club.
Listen, you've got one last chance.
And I don't mean a major league baseball, Steve Howe last chance.
- Where is Jane?
- l don't know.
- Where's the bomb?
- in the Best Picture envelope.
Oh, Mr Drebin, I want to go straight.
I'm tired of the lies.
Oh, kiss me.
Please kiss me.
I've never kissed lips so innocent,
So pure.
He looked like Phil Donahue, white hair...
- That's the guy!
- I'll get him.
(PA) 'Ladies and gentlemen, to present the best picture award, 'two distinguished actors, Olympia Dukakis and James Earl Jones.'
Lord, what's that?

I don't think we should have Phil Donahue back next year.
Thank you.
Good evening.
It's a privilege for us to present the final award...
We've been worried about you.
Where's Rocco?
Where's Tanya?
- Sit down.
Take it easy.
- Thank God you're all right.
"indecent instincts" and "Sawdust And Mildew".
Every one of these movies was a box office hit, except for one.
- What's that?
- The best picture award.
My money's on "Sawdust And Mildew".
Olympia, would you do the honors?
Oh, my God!
That's the one!
The award for this year's best picture goes to...
Wait!
Oh!
Sorry about this.
Loved you in "Cone heads".
You, too.
Let me open this.
(Beeping)
It's the bomb!
Freeze and nobody gets hurt!
Well...from now on.
Back in your seats, you little weasels!
This program's been interrupted.
Don't panic.
Stay with it.
Camera 2, move in on the old lady.
Better move back.
- Don't move!
- (Ma) Now, pay attention!
I don't want to kill nobody unless I have to.
Drop your guns and kick 'em over here.
That bomb belongs to me.
Hand it over, Drebin.
You want to kill him, Ma?
Blink and I start shooting.
(Frank) Give me that gun!
- Oh, my God!
- I'm not falling for that, sister.
I'm not well!
Get this stupid thing off me!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Ohh!
- Ma!
- She's a goner, Rocco.
Dead.
Then that's it.
I'm coming with you, Ma!
Pull out the bomb or I'll shoot the dame.
All right.
I'll do what you say.
- Frank!
- Don't harm her.
You pull out the bomb and you'll kill me anyway.
- Yeah.
No dice!
- Then I'll plug her.
- Shoot her, I'll empty the envelope.
- Frank, think about it.
It's all right.
You'll be dead.
Then you'll kill everyone here.
Yeah.
I'll shoot if you don't do as I say.
Jane?
I'd be safe, so would everyone else.
- But you'd be dead.
- This is complicated, Rocco.
Logically, you're psychotic, so you have the envelope, I'll have the gun.
- Frank?
!
- l know what I'm doing.
All right!
Here's your best picture!
in front of the world, this place is going up.
Well, if I'm going out, I'm going out happy.
Before we're all blown to bits, can I get my underwear out of my crack?
- l got to go comfortable.
- OK, but that's it.
- Give it up, Rocco.
You're history.
- Look, George Hamilton!
Come and get me, Drebin!
Throw me a gun!
Get rid of the bomb!
Hold on, sweetheart.
Frank, help!
- Frank.
- l know what I'm doing.
(Jane) I hate heights!
Ohh!
Oh, no!
Move it, sister!
Screw the commercials!
All right, copper, you killed my ma!
I'm taking the dame away from you.
You hear me, copper?
One push and Mrs Drebin is linoleum.
Get a camera up there.
This could be my best work.
Any last words before I throw you off?
- Yes.
Don't do it.
- Anything else?
Frank, I love you.
I want the world to know you're the perfect man.
Frank, I hope you can hear me.
They said I couldn't do drama.
I was wrong.
Taking you away from Police Squad was a mistake.
I know now that's why you couldn't perform decent sex.
I realize that now, and other things.
Everything's under control.
Nobody move!
Any vibration may set this thing off.
Frank, I've learned my lesson.
And though it may be too late for me, I want all you ladies to remember something.
Don't ever take your men for granted, because good men don't just fall out of the sky.
Aah!
He's caught up in the cable!
Do something!
I'm coming, Ma!
Rocco?
Papshmir?
Jane...
- l never want us to be apart again.
- Oh, Frank!
You like me.
You really like me!
- Frank, slow down!
- Hurry up!
Relax.
There's time.
- You got the camcorder?
- Here.
Which room?
Delivery room.
This must be it.
Jane, I'm here.
Frank is here.
Push!
Here it comes now.
Breathe, honey.
Breathe, Jane.
One more push.
That's it.
Congratulations, Dad.
It's a boy!
Nordberg!
You come back here!
- Frank, it's a boy.
- l know!

Hey, look!
It's the President!
And the Pope!
Oh, my God!
Look!
It's disgruntled postal workers!
Wait a minute!
Give me my baby back!
- Frank!
Are you all right?
- I'm soaking wet.
- I'll get the talcum powder.
- No, I had a nightmare.
There was crime all around me.
I couldn't stop it.
- It was a dream.
- You're right.
All I need is a good rest.
In the morning everything'll be fine.
How's my little boy?
Getting along OK, sweetie?
As well as a heterosexual can in prison.
I don't know how much longer I can take it.
- How's Tanya?
- Tanya's the same.
Milky, creamy skin, pouting red lips, firm buttocks, ample breasts, ears you want to stick your tongue into.
Ma!
I'll get guy cramps!
Sorry.
Rocco, there's somebody here to see you.
Papshmir.
My people are very upset.
They're always upset.
They're Arab terrorists.
Ma, please.
You're supposed to be the best terrorist bomber in the world.
Stations, stores, government buildings...
The devastation in Florida.
- That was Hurricane Andrew.
- That's what they told the public.
We wanted to embarrass the United States, and you made the police look like international heroes.
A first-class job costs five million.
If you want to step up to the price,
I got a target that'll make City Hall look like chicken feed.
That's a big target, but why should I think anything would be different?
$5 million buys me.
- I'm breaking out of here.
- All right, but fail this time and my people won't be so forgiving.
Fail?
Show me one man who can stop me.
Attention shoppers.
Be sure to check out our special on aisle 7.
That's aisle 7.
Give it to me!
My purse!
Somebody help me!
- I want the purse, lady.
- Help me!
Well...
We shot a lot of people together.
It's been great.
But today I retire, so if I do any shooting now, it'll have to be within the confines of my own home.
Hopefully, an intruder and not an in-law, like at my bachelor party.
Well, Ed.
I officially give you my gun.
And my...badge.
And, uh...
Jane and I would like to keep the handcuffs as a souvenir.
Cheer up, Ed.
This is not goodbye.
It's just I won't ever see you again.
My purse!
Somebody help me!
Out of the way.
Lieutenant Drebin!
Frank!
- Didn't you see that?
- What?
Oh, yes.
Kitty litter.
Two bags for a dollar.
Great.
Order.
The jury will disregard that statement.
Continue, Counsellor.
Alimony had been set by the court.
Right, Mr Clayton?
Yes, but...
But not once have you paid alimony to my client, repeatedly defying a court order.
I lost her address.
She moved twice, I couldn't keep up.
Don't lie to me.
You're under oath.
Do you know the penalty for perjury?
I'll ask that again.
Objection!
Your Honour, I...
- Counsel is leading the witness.
- Sustained.
Sweetie, mommy said no pounding when she's in session.
Please read the prosecution's last statement.
"Don't lie to me.
You're under oath."
There.
"Do you know the penalty for perjury?"
That's all I have, Your Honour.
You may continue, Ms Spencer-Drebin.
Er...prosecution rests.
Defence, Ms Davis-Jacob-Steiner-Laszlo?
No further questions, Your Honour.
Court will recess until after the morning feed.
We're gonna win this.
I can feel it.
Yes.
Of course.
I married the wrong man.
I never thought that was possible.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, nothing.
Louise, there's no such thing as the wrong man.
You just have to work at it.
Mr and Mrs Drebin, right?
Now, you two have been married... for six months?
Yes.
We really appreciate you seeing us, Doctor.
You were recommended by our last therapist.
Yes, I was sorry to hear about his suicide.
You know, I feel it's important to get off on the right foot and not get caught up in blame.
Now, which one of you is impotent?
- That would be him.
- Yes, of course.
- Why don't you ask who's frigid?
- That would be him, also.
- How do you know?
You're never home.
- He resents that I work.
He has no idea what a woman wants.
You're so insensitive.
- Is this the toilet seat thing?
- It's babies, Frank.
I want to have a baby.
Whenever we make love, you get a headache.
I'm not a piece of meat, Jane.
I'm trying.
I've got ointments, lotions, creams, books, things that vibrate.
Maybe it's your fault.
Have you tried sexy lingerie?
Some lacy underwear, a black teddy?
I've worn them all.
They don't work.
Why don't you want a child?
Didn't I try to adopt that 18-year-old Korean girl?
Jane, Frank, here's what I suggest.
Make tonight a special night.
Dinner, wine, romantic music.
Put on the 24-hour Johnny Mathis station.
Just be Jane and Frank, lovers.
We haven't had a night like that in... in a long time.
Not together.
Having a baby is a big responsibility.
It's like being in charge of sanitation at a Haitian jail.
I'm just frightened.
Frank, let's make tonight something special.
Oh, honey, it's just that I love you so much.
My little lover sparrow.
My...puppy-wuppy wover.
My little love biscuit.
My little shnooky-wookums.
My little lady cheesy puppy.
Mr and Mrs Drebin, please.
I'm diabetic.
I think you should go now.
I never thought we'd end this way.
How did you think we'd end?
I don't know.
Some other way.
Oh, Jason.
Ed!
Nordberg!
It's been a long time.
Hiya, Frank!
You look terrific!
Thank you.
The little woman got me a Thighmaster.
Where are my manners?
Come on in.
How charming!
Sit, sit.
Excuse the mess.
It's my ironing day.
I just frosted some cupcakes.
- Would you care for one?
- Oh, not just now.
Frank, we have a problem with a terrorist threat.
- Police Squad is certain...
- I'd love a cupcake.
- That coffee smells great.
- I grind my own beans.
Frank, the reason we're here is that we need your help.
It's great!
I hoped you'd like them.
Made them from scratch.
I'll just get off my feet.
We may have a lead on a suspect in the City Hall bombing attempt.
These were taken by a news photographer.
- This girl was the diversion.
- We had them enlarged.
- They look familiar.
- No, the pin, she's a nurse.
Can I keep this one?
We traced her to the Karlson Clinic on Myrtlewood.
- She's Tanya Peters.
- Tanya Peters?
- You know her?
- Don't you remember in the 1970s?
The big disco shoot-out.
Ed, what's happenin', my man?
Frank, we missed you last night at the fondue party.
I went to see the Village People.
They're a stone soul gas, man.
- I can dig it.
- What have we got here?
One dead disco dancer.
Bummer.
What a mindbender, huh?
We think it was a love triangle.
This is the suspect's girlfriend, Tanya Peters.
Cigarette?
Yes, I know.
Well...we'll need a statement from you down at the station.
Coming, Lieutenant!
I do remember.
You were one of the first test cases for monoxodyl, weren't you?
- What?
- I'm glad I could help.
Now, I've got some lamb to put in the oven.
We need a favour.
It's not that big a roast, Nordberg.
No, not that, Frank.
We need you to go undercover at the clinic.
Whoa!
I've given up police work, Ed.
You're whistling up the wrong neck of the woods.
- We're in a bind, Frank.
- What about Hedges and O'Malley?
They're in Hawaii.
Together.
Well, I can't.
Jane and I have a special evening planned.
You'll be home in time to make dinner.
I'd have to make pork chops.
Frank, think of all the crime out there.
Nobody is safe.
You'd be protecting Jane.
You'd be protecting all the Janes of the world.
And you haven't shot anybody in months.
That's true.
Funny how you miss the little things.
Might be good to feel that cold, hard steel pressed against my thigh once again.
The thrill of the chase, to be a man.
After folding the laundry, I went to the Karlson Clinic.
It's always important to have a disguise.
and this operation was no different.
I had no idea if Tanya would recognise me, so I slipped on a fake pair of glasses and combed my hair differently.
The plan was to get in, get information about Tanya's link with the bombing, and get out as quickly as possible.
I figured faking an old football injury would do the trick.
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see a doctor, please.
Sign in here, please.
- Do you have an appointment, Mr...?
- Er, Smith.
No, I don't.
Take a number.
Six.
- What?
- Is six taken?
Does it have to be between 1 and 10?
You'll be called.
Thank you.
Mr Smith?
We've had a cancellation.
We can take you now.
Good morning, Mr Smith.
This way.
I really appreciate your seeing me like this.
I'm sure it won't take too long.
KARLSON SPERM BANK AND FERTILITY CLINIC
When did you notice the problem?
Uh, in the back yard with my uncle.
In the back yard with your uncle?
Yes.
When he comes over to visit, we like to go in the back yard, throw it around for a while.
What did you and your uncle find out?
I can't keep up with him.
Mine hurt, especially on the long ones.
I can't seem to straighten it out.
It has no feeling.
It's kind of numb.
I may have yanked it too much.
- If you would.
- For what?
- A sperm count.
- In here?
It's not exactly the back yard, but it'll do.
Well...
Follow me, and we'll do the necessary paperwork.
Sign these at the bottom and leave them with the nurse.
- This way, please.
- What?
- Number 1 7.
- Oh, no.
- A problem?
- No, no.
- This is 1 7.
- Have we met before?
If you'll excuse me, I'm next.
Sir?
Mr Smith, how are we doing?
I've been busy.
- Do you want a videotape to help?
- Do you have "Dances With Wolves"?
"Rocketeer"? "Lady And The Tramp"?
An adult movie.
The tape was very entertaining.
Follow me.
Do you have "Spartacus"?

Maintenance.
Cleanup, room 7.
Stat.
- What are you doing?
- Just freshening up.
You should look your best even though you're by yourself.
Are you sure we've never met?
Oh, here's my cup.
Back to work.
Mr Smith?
- Are you OK in there?
- I could use a little help.
Dr Rosenblatt, foreplay in room 7, please.
Dr Rosenblatt.
Honey...
I've been waiting all day.
I'm wearing the nightgown you bought me for our honeymoon.
Tonight's going to be special.
I'm going to make love to you for hours and hours.
Wouldn't Mr Happy like that?
- Hours?
- Like our first time together.
Jane, why don't I soak in the tub for a couple of days?
Possibly a week.
You're so cute.
Let me go get the oysters and clams.
Here.
I'll shave your back like last time.
Jane, I really don't think we should.
I...
Frank!
What's this?
I...fell on a rake.
You're lying.
Now I know why Ed's been calling.
- You're back on a case, aren't you?
- No, I swear.
It's another woman!
In your wildest dreams!
It's bad enough not having a baby, but I warned you about Police Squad, you white Anglo male!
It was nothing, Jane.
I was doing Ed a small favour!
Some retirement.
I'm leaving, Frank.
I never thought you'd go back on your word.
- Aren't you being hasty?
- I don't think so.
That's my cab.
I'll be at Louise's.
Oh, Frank, how could you?
We need time apart to think about us.
I'm not going to think.
Why start now?
I love you.
Look, baby, I am what I am and I do what I do.
A few guys make shoelaces, some lay sod, some make a living neutering animals.
- I'm a cop.
- Pretty speech, Frank.
But my mind is made up.
I'm leaving.
All right.
Then take this with you.
You know how my lips feel about things.
Goodbye, Frank.
You're listening to KSAD, all-depressing, all the time.
Here's a dedication to Frank from Jane, who just called from a taxi.
"Frank, you lying weasel-weenie.
"First you shoot blanks, now you're letting all the heat out..."
He said he'd never go back to police work.
Once a cop, always a cop.
- He's married to his work.
- You'll always come in second.
There was an article in Cosmo - "Why all men are pigs".
"Frank" is just another word for loser.
I never want to see him again.
I want to get as far away as possible.
We'll go to my friend's cabin by the smelting plant.
The fresh air will do you good.
Go easy.
That's your second bottle of Chanel.
You're witnessing the beginning of a new Jane Spencer-Drebin.
No more little miss perky, devoting her life to one man.
I'm out for the new me.
Let's burn rubber.
- Didn't forget anything, did you?
- I hope not.
Just calm down, ma'am.
How many bodies did you find in your pool?
Sir, killing a gang member's only an $18 fine.
Just mail it in.
- Frank!
Glad you could make it!
- Welcome, buddy.
Did you find Tanya's address, Frank?
I wrote it on a hanky, and I can't remember what I did with it.
- I'm getting a bit rusty.
- It could happen to anybody.
I brought you some of Frank's never-fail fudge!
You go on about your business.
I'll stay out of your hair.
It'll be...
Frank, let me take that.
We've got a surprise for you.
It's in honour of your thirty years on the force.
Nordberg.
Oh, boy.
This is really great.
Thank you, guys.
We thought it might cheer you up.
We heard about you and Jane.
Jane, Jane.
That name will always remind me of her.
Frank, I feel really bad about all of this.
If there's anything you need.
Dr Kevorkian's home phone number?
Nordberg, put it together.
- Frank, you know we're here for you.
- Thanks, Ed.
- Well, look who's here.
- Hi, Frank.
Nice to see you.
- I've got that data on the bomb.
- What did you find out?
The explosive is a very fine powder.
- It tastes like...
- That's fertiliser.
Another case.
This is what I'm talking about.
We detected a high quantity of nitroglycerine.
- Can you tell us where it came from?
- I'd be glad to.
Billions of years ago, the Earth was a molten mass...
Ted, I'm talking about the powder.
We don't know about that.
Let me take that urine specimen.
We found a list of the bomber's plans at the scene.
On a hunch, we analysed the paper.
- And you got something?
- Yes.
The paper's from Statesville Prison.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
We analysed the fibres and found them to be from the rare Canary Island pine, which grows only in Oregon.
Contacting paper mills in that area led us to a distribution centre in Tacoma.
Unfortunately, the trail ended there.
- How'd you trace it to the prison?
- Right here on the letterhead.
After comparing handwriting of every known bomber serving a stretch in Statesville, we came up with a suspect - Rocco Dillon.
He's masterminding the bombings from inside the prison.
There's only one way to find out where Rocco will strike next.
We have to send someone in there.
- I'll do it.
- I wouldn't feel right about that.
If Rocco thinks you're a cop, you might end up dead.
"You might end up dead" is my middle name.
What about Jane?
I don't know her middle name.
I need the action.
I'm going inside the big house.
Frank, Ed.
I think you might want to see this.
We're testing out a prototype for an anti-carjacking device.
We'll see how it works.
Get out!
Don't make me...
We call it the Denver jockstrap.
After being retired for six months, I was finally back in action.
Faster than saying "spread 'em", I was in Statesville Prison.
I was surrounded by pimps, rapists and murderers.
It was like being in the stands at an LA Raiders game.
It was going to take all my police experience just to stay alive here.
After a long and generous cavity search,
I reached my destination, Maximum Security, home of some of the most violent sociopaths in the country.
And the worst of them all, Rocco Dillon.
All right, in here.
Ain't no prison yet could hold me.
Attica!
Attica!
Power to the brothers!
Kill whitey!
Kill whitey!
Knock it off!
You're chirping loud for a new canary.
Keep flashing the big eyes and I'll rotate your jaw.
Hey!
You know who you talking to?
The man is Rocco Dillon.
- Where's your prison number?
- It's unlisted.
Just call me Nick "The Slasher" McGirk.
Look, I'm the muscle in this pen.
Just stay out of my way.
You just watch your step, McGirk.
Take it from me, this place changes a man.
Yeah?
How?
I used to be white.
I was the drummer for the Osmonds.
Screw with me, he'll make you feel pain like never before.
I know.
I remember the Osmonds.
- Better hit the rack, McGirk.
- In a minute.
First I'm gonna make a list of who I'm gonna kill in the next few days.
Lights out.
Lockdown in two minutes.
My dearest snooky wookums dumpling buns,
I miss you so much.
I haven't hurt this bad since the last time I was dumped.
I remember it well.
Her name was Gabriella.
We were supposed to be married, but on the day of our wedding, she never showed up.
I was heartbroken.
I figured she had fallen for another man, someone who could do to her what I never could.
I thought my life was over until that one glorious day.
That was the day you became my wife.
Our friends gathered to celebrate our love.
It seems like only yesterday.
We were all so overjoyed.
I remember wishing we could take everyone with us.
That was the happiest day of my life.
I remember the plans we made.
Things were going to be so perfect.
We got that housekeeper you always wanted.
Hi, Mr D. Hi, Mrs D.
And I knew that eventually our dream would come true.
One day we'd have our own Frank Drebin Jr.
Shut up.
I'm trying to get some sleep.
Nah, it's no use.
She'll never come back.
Bend over and pick it up for me, would you, lover?
No problem.
Rocco could tell from my escapade in the shower that I was well-endowed with courage.
Now I had to get on the inside.
Like a blind man at an orgy, I was going to have to feel things out.
Tyrone, I got the escape plans right here.
Just you and me.
- Burnett wants in.
- Burnett's one of the guards!
I know, but he's unhappy here.
All right, all right.
Whatever.
Got it all worked out right here.
What's this?
Another letter from your mommy?
- That's private!
- Let's see what we have.
- Give the man back his letter.
- Buzz off, butter cheeks.
What's so special about a little letter?
Wait a minute...
An escape plan!
This is your ticket to another twenty years, Dillon.
If the warden gets one look at this...
Hey!
You call this slop?
Real slop has got chunks in it!
This is more like gruel!
And this Chateau le Blanc '68 is supposed to be served slightly chilled!
This is room temperature!
What do you think we are, animals?
No!
What are we?
Homo sapiens?
You're right!
We are men!
We are men!
Left hand blue.
Whose hand is that?
Come on, son.
You can do it.
Eat some beans!
You saved my bacon, McGirk.
I'd be in solitary if you hadn't done that.
You saved my bacon, McGirk.
I'd be in solitary if you hadn't done that.
I've been watching you.
You handle yourself good.
- "Really well".
- Whatever.
I got something big on the outside.
I could use you in my gang.
- Dental plan?
- Full coverage.
- What's the caper?
- First we bust out.
Thanks to you, we still have our escape plan.
Let's have it.
- It's a good plan.
- I've had better.
Listen, I've got a foolproof plan.
They got Tyrone.
Can't...
Can't we all just get along?
Now that Tyrone was in solitary, it was just me and Rocco.
He had to trust me...
Hold on.
OK.
I convinced Rocco to dig a tunnel.
It was that or go out in a laundry truck.
The thought of lying nose down in skidmarks didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.
Disposing of the dirt was a problem I solved early in the construction.
Apart from some chafing, we made good progress.
We kept digging.
Dummies gave the impression we were still in our cell.
Lights out.
There was more dirt than I thought.
Disposing of it was becoming tricky.
Safe!
Where are you going?
- Are you thinking of Frank again?
- They're playing our song.
I understand.
Take your time.
- Hello there.
- Excuse me.
I'm hauling a load of rice cakes to Big D. Coming with me?
No.
- How about a kiss?
- No.
When a woman says no, she means yes.
- How about that kiss?
- Yes.
No?
I know your type.
Come on, baby.
We're two of a kind.
Oh, my God!
You killed him!
It was an accident.
Call the police.
Come to your senses.
You killed a man.
You're a hero to every woman.
We have to call Frank.
He'll protect us.
Frank is a man.
He'll see you locked away forever.
Jane, I want to join you, to help you kill as many men as possible.
Louise, do what you have to do.
I'm calling Frank.
Oh, boy, did that hurt.
Be home, Frank.
Answer the phone.
Hi, this is Frank and Jane.
We're the Drebins.
We're not home right now so leave a message!
- Which button is it?
- Not that one!
Tanya?
It was another woman.
Frank wasn't lying.
Honeymoon Bay Road.
I bet they're alone there now!
Cell inspection.
There's been a rumour of a possible breakout.
If we suspect anyone of attempting to escape, they will be punished severely.
Once word of the escape was out, we headed for the tunnel.
The last few feet were dug on the run.
Another forty-seven yards would take us beyond the prison walls.
May he rest in peace, in the arms of our...
Jesus Christ!
Amen.
Rocco had arranged for a car to meet us.
After making a slight adjustment we arrived at the rendezvous point - a Los Angeles city high school.
Hey, that was close.
Hey, Rocco, who's the old hag?
She take one in the face?
She's my mother.
Mrs Dillon.
Your son is a ruthless, sadistic, cold-blooded animal.
- You must be proud of him.
- I am.
I want you to meet a real square egg,
Nick "The Slasher" McGirk.
There's fresh clothes in the back.
Rocco's mom was quiet.
I felt she didn't care for me coming along.
Like a midget at a urinal,
I was going to have to stay on my toes.
Hey!
Stop!
It wasn't my fault.
That cow shouldn't have been in the road.
Hurry up.
You're letting the flies in.
- What do you think?
- Great setup.
No phone, miles from the nearest town, Playboy channel - perfect.
Nice digs.
But I'm here for the action.
What is it?
Bank, armoured car, payroll?
You're getting a little bit too nosy, McGirk.
Relax, Ma.
- She's itching to use her new gun.
- I know the feeling.
It was Tanya.
That bathing suit was never happier.
I had only a second to admire the view.
I had to watch out.
If she made me as a cop, I'd be tonight's meat loaf.
Come here, sexy.
You're all woman.
I could tell by looking at you.
Hey, she's referring to me.
I was talking about your mother.
That's no way to be walking around.
Get some clothes on.
And what are you doing in my bathing suit?
Hey, who's the stud?
Meet the newest member of our gang.
Slasher McGirk, meet Tanya Peters.
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
I smelled cop on him the minute I saw him.
I get it all the time.
It's the underwear ads.
- Are you saying you're not a cop?
- Well, yeah.
- That's good enough for me.
- Me, too.
All right.
I'm glad that's all cleared up.
Ma, why not kiss and make up?
Well, all right.
Now that's more like it.
I had to get a message to Police Squad.
This was more than I could handle.
No phone, miles from civilisation, my prospects look bleaker than a gerbil's in a bat house.
Who's down there?
Slasher...
Have you seen my pigeon?
- Pigeon?
What pigeon?
- What are you doing?
I'm...just contemplating my next move.
Your bishop is exposed.
It's these pants.
I usually wear a fuller cut.
You're all man.
I like that in my men.
You're coming on to me big-time, sister, but we got a problem.
- You're Jewish?
- No.
You're Rocco's girl.
In my book, that chapter's called "Look, But Don't Touch".
I could have two lovers.
Kinky.
But I like my sex the way I play basketball - one-on-one, with as little dribbling as possible.
Oh, you're tense, Slasher.
Well, I could relax more if I knew about tomorrow.
You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
All I know is it's downtown and...big.
That's the way I like it.
- What else?
- Just this.
What are you doing?
Thank you for the advice.
I'll try that recipe, Miss Peters.
How could you?
Just shove your tongue in as far as you can.
Quiet.
You don't know me here.
That's a goodbye kiss, sister.
What's all this?
Who's the skirt?
Just some dizzy dame.
Probably broke down.
I'll take her to the bus depot.
Hey, she's married.
What if her husband comes looking?
- He must be a great guy.
- He breaks promises.
Look at you, traipsing all over, just to spite him.
- He left me.
- You left him.
- You should talk.
- Listen to you.
Jeez, you two, knock it off!
- You'd think you're married!
- What'll we do with her?
One thing's for sure.
There's no room for her here.
- I say we bump her off.
- Let's plug her here.
I've been on a job where I'd have given my eye teeth for a hostage.
We know women make the best hostages.
They're small, easy to move, eat less, smell nice.
Yeah, we got us an insurance policy.
Good thinking, kid.
Now, let's get some shuteye.
We got a big day ahead of us.
All right, it's rigged.
Watch the tower, Slasher.
This is what'll happen tonight.
Hey, aren't we far away?
All right, pay attention.
On that tower's a device that's gonna net us five million bucks.
We're gonna detonate it this evening at an event that the whole world will be watching.
- Your crowning achievement.
- It's for both of us, Ma.
All set!
Set!
Very impressive.
Cool.
Cool.
America will be brought to its knees by this terrorist act.
This will be more embarrassing to the US than Tonya Harding.
We're almost there.
I don't wanna miss this.
Regards to Mrs Khadafi.
Tell her thanks for the cookies.
It's a beautiful night in Los Angeles, and the stars are shining bright for the 66th Academy Awards.
Fans are clamouring to see their favourite celebrities.
It's Weird Al Yankovic and Vanna White.
Put the dame in the trunk.
I'll meet you and Ma round back in ten minutes.
Got the passes?
If we pull this off, it's five million big ones.
Not bad!
- What's going to happen to me?
- I have an idea.
Right, Slasher.
You know what to do.
Check the tyres and fluid levels.
No, you muffin head, the dame.
We hit trouble, she's a bullet shield.
Ladies and gentlemen, to present the lifetime achievement award...
Roll tape.
Go to clip.
Aspirin, please.
Go to three.
Ready, four.
This year's lifetime achievement award winner's credits include some of the greatest moments on celluloid.
Films such as "Sandals And Loincloth", 1958,
"Sweaty Boatmen", 1959,
"The Leather-clad Centurion", 1960, and his first colour feature in 1966,
"Big Shiny Spears".
OK, there's the man from Bryce Porterhouse.
He guards the envelopes until they're handed out.
He won't budge.
You know what to do.
Distract him so I can plant the bomb.
Accepting the award for Mr Broncowitz is Margaret Redfeather.
That ought to do it.
You'll never get away with this.
Rocco will kill you, whoever you are.
Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Isn't that a unusual?
- It's happened before.
- Here's the plan.
- You'll never stop Rocco.
- Your chances are one in a million.
- Better than any state lottery.
I'm the good guy.
I can't let the bad guys win.
Our children can't be raised in fear.
They're going to blow that place sky high.
It'll be a tragedy.
Unless it's during a dance number.
Come on.
Does that radio work?
Call Police Squad.
Tell them Frank Drebin...
Forget it.
I wonder what the devil he wanted?
- Hold on.
- Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Yeah, and I'm Robert de Niro.
- Mr de Niro, we must get inside.
You and 10,000 other people.
Move along.
- Movie stars only.
- Come on.
I've got a better idea.
Cue talent.
To present the award for best supporting actress,
Mariel Hemingway and Elliott Gould.
Thank you.
The nominees for best supporting actress are...
Mary Lou Retton, "Fatal Affair".
One woman's ordeal to overcome the death of her cat, set against the background of the Hindenburg disaster.
Morgan Fairchild, "Final Proposal".
One courageous pioneer woman's triumphant victory over bulimia, set during the Donner Party crossing.
Sorry about this, but it's official police business.
Shannen Doherty, "Basic Analysis".
One woman's triumph over a yeast infection, set against the background of the tragic Buffalo Bills' season of 1991 .
Thank you, Sheriff.
Still no word of Frank or Rocco's gang.
I'm worried.
He should have called by now.
Let me just check your tickets.
- Lovely gown.
Is that cool whip?
- Uh-huh.
Tim and Erica Brown.
OK, enjoy the show.
Let's see, Vanna White and Weird Al Yankovic.
OK, enjoy the awards.
And 3.
And Florence Henderson, "Analysis Of A Proposal".
- Rocco could be anywhere.
- Where could the bomb be?
- The winner is...
- This is going to be dynamite.
- Jane!
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Florence Henderson is going to win!
- No!
The bomb's in the envelope.
- You're right!
And the winner is... ..Mary Lou Retton for "Fatal Affair".
Yes!
Yes!
Sorry.
We were rooting for Florence Henderson.
We must get those envelopes before they open any more.
Yes!
I never realised there'd be so many.
They added 75 new categories.
"Best actor in a Columbus movie"?
To present the award for best director,
Raquel Welch and the host of his own talk show, Phil Donahue.
That might be the envelope with the bomb.
Keep looking.
One more second, Mr Donahue.
Oh, my God!
Look at Donahue!
Stop the stairs, Joey!
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to present...
What the hell?
- Jesus!
- Go to commercial.
Easy, now.
Talk to me.
What happened, Ma?
Slasher is Frank Drebin of Police Squad.
That lousy, two-bit, copper punk!
I treat him like my brother...
the one I didn't kill.
- He might find the bomb.
- Not if I find him first.
Back from commercial in five seconds.
Hurry with the mic and cue Donahue.
Read the card, moron.
"Well, Raquel, this certainly is a special evening.
Phew!
"I can barely catch my breath.
Turn it over to Raquel.
"I'm used to being out of breath..."
What the hell?
"Hold for laughter and applause.
To Phil.
"Gets me out of breath just watching.
To Raquel..."
I read that.
"But let's get to the subject at hand.
Pick up the envelope."
The nominees for best director are...
Sir Richard Attenborough for his musical on the life of Mother Teresa, "Mother".
Spike Lee, "X II, The Merchandising".
Nordberg, look!
That's Frank at the Academy Awards.
How'd he get tickets?
That's where Rocco is going to strike next.
He's planning to blow up the Academy Awards.
- We've got to go.
- We're not invited.
We're cops.
It's for you.
Nordberg, Police Squad.
Hello?
Hello?
Henderson, see about this phone.
I think it's broke.
And now, today's lucky lotto numbers.
Get your tickets ready, 1 2, 22, 18, and 9.
And for his tale of genetics gone haywire in a retirement community,
Steven Spielberg, "Geriatric Park".
SEISURE WORLD
The winner is...
Raquel, just a second.
I just had a thought.
Christ!
This show is being seen all over the world.
If we could send good thoughts, transmit them through these cameras, to the leader of China...
Wing Wa Woo Tong... so that they might finally...be nice.
Thank you.
And the winner is...
Raquel, so many go to bed hungry in this nation.
Yet, cat food's full of tuna.
I can't help thinking each time I go to the zoo and see those porpoises crammed into tiny tanks, what a waste that is.
Butcher half of them now.
Hundreds of pounds of dolphin meat that could be fed to cats, freeing up that tuna for our nation's hungry.
- And the winner is...
- So many are...cold, shivering in the night.
I say take those cats and skin them.
Use their fur to keep hundreds warm.
Jesus, Phil!
And the winner is...
Give me that!
- Not one move.
- That barrel's cold.
It's room temperature.
It's OK.
It's not the bomb.
- Silver hair.
- About 6' 2".
Looked like Phil Donahue.
- That's the guy!
- Get him!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome internationally renowned singing star, Pia Zadora.
There he is!
Stop him.
Excuse me.
Isn't that snot on your shoe?
I'll stay here.
You check the wings.
Oh, no!
Not him again?
Please, God.
Grab him!
I'm Ed Hocken.
This is Officer Nordberg.
- We're here to prevent a disaster.
- You're too late.
Come on, Nordberg.
We've got to get Frank.
I knew I'd bump into you.
I want answers, cherry cakes.
- I love you.
- Wrong answer.
I dropped out of the sap of the month club.
Listen, you've got one last chance.
And I don't mean a major league baseball Steve Howe last chance.
- Where is Jane?
- I don't know.
- Where's the bomb?
- In the Best Picture envelope.
Oh, Mr Drebin, I want to go straight.
I'm tired of the lies.
Oh, kiss me.
Please kiss me.
I've never kissed lips so innocent, so pure...
He looked like Phil Donahue, white hair...
- That's the guy!
- I'll get him.
Ladies and gentlemen, to present the Best Picture award, two most distinguished actors, Olympia Dukakis and James Earl Jones.
Lord, what's that?
Looks like Phil Donahue throwing up in a tuba.
I don't think we should have Phil Donahue back next year.
Thank you.
Good evening.
It's a privilege for us to present the final award...
We've been worried about you.
Where's Rocco?
Where's Tanya?
- Sit down.
Take it easy.
- Thank God you're all right.
"Indecent Instincts" and "Sawdust And Mildew".
Every one of these movies was a box office hit, except for one.
- What's that?
- The Best Picture award.
My money's on "Sawdust And Mildew".
Olympia, would you do the honours?
Oh, my God!
That's the one!
The award for this year's Best Picture goes to...
Wait!
Sorry about this.
Loved you in "Coneheads".
You, too.
Let me open this.
It's the bomb!
Freeze and nobody gets hurt!
Well...from now on.
Back in your seats, you little weasels!
This program's been interrupted.
Don't panic.
Stay with it.
Camera 2, move in on the old lady.
Better move back.
- Don't move!
- Now, pay attention!
I don't want to kill nobody unless I have to.
Drop your guns and kick 'em over here.
That bomb belongs to me.
Hand it over, Drebin.
You want to kill him, Ma?
Blink and I start shooting.
Give me that gun!
- Oh, my God!
- I'm not falling for that, sister.
She's a goner, Rocco.
Dead.
Then that's it.
I'm coming with you, Ma!
Pull out the bomb or I'll shoot the dame.
All right.
I'll do what you say.
Don't harm her.
You pull out the bomb and you'll kill me anyway.
- Yeah.
No dice!
- Then I'll plug her.
- Shoot her, I'll empty the envelope.
- Frank, think about it.
It's all right.
You'll be dead.
Then you'll kill everyone here.
Yeah.
I'll shoot if you don't do as I say.
I'd be safe, so would everyone else.
- But you'd be dead.
- This is complicated, Rocco.
Logically, you're psychotic, so you have the envelope, I'll have the gun.
I know what I'm doing.
All right!
Here's your Best Picture!
In front of the world, this place is going up.
Well, if I'm going out, I'm going out happy.
Wait.
Before we're all blown up, can I get my underwear out of my crack?
- I got to go comfortable.
- OK, but that's it.
- Give it up, Rocco.
You're history.
- Look, George Hamilton!
Come and get me, Drebin!
Throw me a gun!
Get rid of the bomb!
Hold on, sweetheart.
Frank, help!
I know what I'm doing.
I hate heights!
Move it, sister!
Screw the commercials!
All right, copper, you killed my ma!
I'm taking the dame away from you.
You hear me, copper?
One push and Mrs Drebin is linoleum.
Get a camera up there.
This could be my best work.
Any last words before I throw you off?
- Yes.
Don't do it.
- Anything else?
Frank, I love you.
I want the world to know you're the perfect man.
Frank, I hope you can hear me.
They said I couldn't do drama.
I was wrong.
Taking you away from Police Squad was a mistake.
I know now that's why you couldn't perform decent sex.
I realise that now, and other things.
Everything's under control.
Nobody move!
Any vibration may set this thing off.
Frank, I've learned my lesson.
And though it may be too late for me,
I want all you ladies to remember something.
Don't ever take your men for granted, because good men don't just fall out of the sky.
He's caught up in the cable!
Do something!
I'm coming, Ma!
Papshmir?
- I never want us to be apart again.
- Oh, Frank!
You like me.
You really like me!
- Frank, slow down!
- Hurry up!
Relax.
There's time.
- You got the camcorder?
- Here.
Which room?
Delivery room.
This must be it.
Jane, I'm here.
Frank is here.
Push!
Here it comes now.
Breathe, honey.
Breathe, Jane.
One more push.
That's it.
Congratulations, Dad.
It's a boy!
You come back here!
- Frank, it's a boy.
- I know!
(Clock chiming)
(Baby crying)
(Woman) Hey, look!
It's the President!
And the Pope!
Yee-aah!
Yah!
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la!
(Man) Oh, my God!
Look!
It's disgruntled postal workers!
(Click)
Wait a minute!
Give me my baby back!
Aah!
Aah!
- Frank!
Frank, are you all right?
- I'm soaking wet.
- I'll get the talcum powder.
- No, I had a nightmare.
There was crime all around me.
I couldn't stop it.
- It was a dream.
- You're right.
All I need is a good rest.
in the morning everything'll be fine.
(Dogs whine)
How's my little boy?
Getting along OK, sweetie?
As well as a heterosexual can in prison.
I don't know how much longer I can take it.
- How's Tanya?
- Tanya's the same.
Milky, creamy skin, pouting red lips, firm buttocks, ample breasts, ears you want to stick your tongue into.
Ma!
I'll get guy cramps!
Sorry.
Rocco, there's somebody here to see you.
Papshmir.
My people are very upset.
They're always upset.
They're Arab terrorists.
Ma, please.
You're supposed to be the best terrorist bomber in the world.
Stations, stores, government buildings...
The devastation in Florida.
- That was Hurricane Andrew.
- That's what they told the public.
We wanted to embarrass the United States, and you made the police look like international heroes.
A first-class job costs five million.
If you want to step up to the price,
I got a target that'll make City Hall look like chicken feed.
That's a big target, but why should I think anything would be different?
Cos $5 million buys me.
I'm breaking out of here.
All right, but fail this time and my people won't be so forgiving.
Fail?
Show me one man who can stop me.
# I used to be a renegade #
# I used to fool around #
# But I couldn't take the punishment #
# I had to settle down #
# Now I'm playing it real straight #
# And yes, I cut my hair... #
(PA) 'Attention shoppers.

(PA) 'That's aisle 7.'
# It's hip to be square... #
Hey!
Give it to me!
(Lady) My purse!
Somebody help me!
(Thief) I want the purse, lady.
(Lady) Help me!
# He's a jolly good fellow #
# For he's a jolly good fellow #
# Which nobody can deny #
Hear!
Hear!
Well...
We shot a lot of people together.
It's been great.
But today I retire, so if I do any shooting now, it'll have to be within the confines of my own home.
Hopefully, an intruder and not an in-law, like at my bachelor party.
Well, Ed.
- I officially give you my gun.
- Aw...
- And...my badge.
- (Whimpers)
- And, uh...
Jane and I would like to keep the handcuffs as a souvenir.
- Oh, gee...
- Cheer up, Ed.
This is not goodbye.
It's just I won't ever see you again.
Oh, Frank.
(Lady) My purse!
Somebody help me!
(Thief) Out of the way.
Lieutenant Drebin!
Frank!
- Didn't you see that?
- What?
Oh, yes.
Kitty litter.
Two bags for a dollar.
Great.
'Order.
The jury will disregard that statement.
Continue, Counsellor.'
Alimony had been set by the court.
Right, Mr Clayton?
Yes, but...
But not once have you paid alimony to my client, repeatedly defying a court order.
I lost her address.
She moved twice, I couldn't keep up.
Don't lie to me.
You're under oath.
Do you know the penalty for perjury?
(Babies crying)
I'll ask that again.
Objection!
Your Honour, I...ow, ow.
Jeez!
- Counsel is leading the witness.
- Sustained.
(Gavel pounds)
Sweetie, mommy said no pounding when she's in session.
Please read the prosecution's last statement.
"Don't lie to me.
You're under oath."
- (Burp)
- There.
"Do you know the penalty for perjury?"
That's all I have, Your Honour.
You may continue, Ms Spencer-Drebin.
Er...prosecution rests.
Defence, Ms Davis-Jacob-Steiner-Laszlo?
No further questions, Your Honour.
Court will recess until after the morning feed.
(Squeak)
We're gonna win this.
I can feel it.
Yes.
Of course.
I married the wrong man.
I never thought that was possible.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, nothing.
Louise, there's no such thing as the wrong man.
You just have to work at it.
Now, let's see.
Mr and Mrs Drebin, right?
Now, you two have been married... for six months?
Yes.
We really appreciate you seeing us, Doctor.
You were recommended by our last therapist.
Yes, I was sorry to hear about his suicide.
You know, I feel it's important to get off on the right foot and not get caught up in blame.
Now, which one of you is impotent?
- That would be him.
- Yes, of course.
- Why don't you ask who's frigid?
- That would be him, also.
- How do you know?
You're never home.
- He resents that I work.
He has no idea what a woman wants.
You're so insensitive.
- Is this the toilet seat thing?
- It's babies, Frank.
I want to have a baby.
Whenever we make love, you get a headache.
I'm not a piece of meat, Jane.
I'm trying.
I've got ointments, lotions, creams, books, things that vibrate.
- Frank!
- Maybe it's your fault.
Have you tried sexy lingerie?
Some lacy underwear, a black teddy?
I've worn them all.
They don't work.
Oh.
Why don't you want a child?
Didn't I try to adopt that 18-year-old Korean girl?
Jane, Frank, here's what I suggest.
Make tonight a special night.
Dinner, wine, romantic music.
Put on the 24-hour Johnny Mathis station.
Just be Jane and Frank, lovers.
We haven't had a night like that in... in a long time.
- Not together.
- Frank?
Jane...
Having a baby is a big responsibility.
It's like being in charge of sanitation at a Haitian jail.
I'm just frightened.
Frank, let's make tonight something special.
Oh, honey, it's just that I love you so much.
My little lover sparrow.
My...puppy-wuppy wover.
My little love biscuit.
My little shnooky-wookums.
My little lady cheesy puppy.
Mr and Mrs Drebin, please.
I'm diabetic.
I think you should go now.
'I never thought we'd end this way.'
'How did you think we'd end?
'
'I don't know.
'Some other way.'
'Oh, Jason.'
(Crying)
(Doorbell)
Ed!
Nordberg!
It's been a long time.
Hiya, Frank!
You look terrific!
Thank you.
The little woman got me a Thighmaster.
Where are my manners?
Come on in.
How charming!
Sit, sit.
Excuse the mess.
It's my ironing day.
I just frosted some cupcakes.
- Would you care for one?
- Oh, not just now.
Frank, we have a problem with a terrorist threat.
- Police Squad is certain...
- I'd love a cupcake.
- That coffee smells great.
- I grind my own beans.
Frank, the reason we're here is that we need your help.
It's great!
I hoped you'd like them.
Made them from scratch.
I'll just get off my feet.
We may have a lead on a suspect in the City Hall bombing attempt.
These were taken by a news photographer.
- This girl was the diversion.
- We had them enlarged.
- They look familiar.
- No, the pin, she's a nurse.
Can I keep this one?
We traced her to the Karlson Clinic on Myrtlewood.
- She's Tanya Peters.
- Tanya Peters?
- You know her?
- Don't you remember in the 1970s?
The big disco shoot-out.
(The Bee Gees: "Stayin' Alive")
# Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk #
# I'm a woman's man, no time to talk #
# The music loud, the women warm #
# I've been kicked around since I was born #
# But it's all right, I'm OK #
# You may look the other way #
# We can try to understand... #
Ed, what's happenin', my man?
Frank, we missed you last night at the fondue party.
I went to see the Village People.
They're a stone soul gas, man.
- I can dig it.
- What have we got here?
One dead disco dancer.
Bummer.
What a mindbender, huh?
We think it was a love triangle.
This is the suspect's girlfriend, Tanya Peters.
Cigarette?
Yes, I know.
Well...we'll need a statement from you down at the station.
Nordberg!
Coming, Lieutenant!
# Somebody help me #
# I'm stayin' alive... #
I do remember.
You were one of the first test cases for monoxodyl, weren't you?
- What?
- I'm glad I could help.
Now, I've got some lamb to put in the oven.
We need a favour.
It's not that big a roast, Nordberg.
No, not that, Frank.
We need you to go undercover at the clinic.
Whoa!
I've given up police work, Ed.
You're whistling up the wrong neck of the woods.
- We're in a bind, Frank.
- What about Hedges and O'Malley?
They're in Hawaii.
Together.
Well, I can't.
Jane and I have a special evening planned.
You'll be home in time to make dinner.
I'd have to make pork chops.
Frank, think of all the crime out there.
Nobody is safe.
You'd be protecting Jane.
You'd be protecting all the Janes of the world.
And you haven't shot anybody in months.
That's true.
Funny how you miss the little things.
Might be good to feel that cold, hard steel pressed against my thigh once again.
The thrill of the chase, to be a man.
'After folding the laundry, I went to the Karlson Clinic.
'It's always important to have a disguise.
'and this operation was no different.
'I had no idea if Tanya would recognise me, 'so I slipped on a fake pair of glasses 'and combed my hair differently.
'The plan was to get in, 'get information about Tanya's link with the bombing, 'and get out as quickly as possible.
'I figured faking an old football injury would do the trick.'
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see a doctor, please.
Sign in here, please.
- Do you have an appointment, Mr...?
- Er, Smith.
No, I don't.
Take a number.
Six.
- What?
- Is six taken?
Does it have to be between 1 and 10?
You'll be called.
Thank you.
Mr Smith?
We've had a cancellation.
We can take you now.
Good morning, Mr Smith.
This way.
I really appreciate your seeing me like this.
I'm sure it won't take too long.
When did you notice the problem?
Uh, in the back yard with my uncle.
in the back yard with your uncle?
Yes.
When he comes over to visit, we like to go in the back yard, throw it around for a while.
What did you and your uncle find out?
I can't keep up with him.
Mine hurt, especially on the long ones.
I can't seem to straighten it out.
it has no feeling.
It's kind of numb.
I may have yanked it too much.
- If you would.
- For what?
- A sperm count.
- In here?
It's not exactly the back yard, but it'll do.
Well.
(Wip)
(Shouting and yelping)
(Glass breaking)
(Wip)
Follow me, and we'll do the necessary paperwork.
Sign these at the bottom and leave them with the nurse.
- This way, please.
- What?
- Number 1 7.
- Oh, no.
- A problem?
- No, no.
- This is 1 7.
- Have we met before?
If you'll excuse me, I'm next.
Ooh!
Aah!
Agh!
Eurgh!
- Sir?
- Aah!
Mr Smith, how are we doing?
(Sheep bleats)
I've been busy.
- Do you want a videotape to help?
- Do you have "Dances With Wolves"?
"Rocketeer"? "Lady And The Tramp"?
An adult movie.
Hmm...
Ooh!
Aah!
Yeow!
The tape was very entertaining.
Follow me.
Do you have "Spartacus"?
(PA) 'Maintenance.
Cleanup, room 7.
'Maintenance.
Cleanup, room 7.
Stat.'
- What are you doing?
- Just freshening up.
You should look your best even though you're by yourself.
Are you sure we've never met?
Oh, here's my cup.
Back to work.
- (Knocking)
- Mr Smith?
- Are you OK in there?
- I could use a little help.
(PA) 'Dr Rosenblatt, foreplay in room 7, please.
'Dr Rosenblatt.'
(Romantic music)
Honey...
I've been waiting all day.
I'm wearing the nightgown you bought me for our honeymoon.
Tonight's going to be special.
I'm going to make love to you for hours and hours.
Wouldn't Mr Happy like that?
- Hours?
- Like our first time together.
Jane, why don't I soak in the tub for a couple of days?
Possibly a week.
You're so cute.
Let me go get the oysters and clams.
# Walk my way #
# And a thousand violins #
# Begin to play #
# Or it might be the sound #
# Of your hello #
# That music I hear #
# I get misty #
# The moment you're near #
# You can say #
# That you're leading me on... #
Here.
I'll shave your back like last time.
Jane, I really don't think we should.
I...
Frank!
What's this?
I...fell on a rake.
You're lying.
Now I know why Ed's been calling.
- You're back on a case, aren't you?
- No, I swear.
It's another woman!
in your wildest dreams!
It's bad enough not having a baby, but I warned you about Police Squad, you white Anglo male!
Jane!
Ah!
Jane!
it was nothing, Jane.
I was doing Ed a small favour!
Some retirement.
I'm leaving, Frank.
I never thought you'd go back on your word.
- Aren't you being hasty?
- I don't think so.
- (Doorbell)
- That's my cab.
I'll be at Louise's.
Oh, Frank, how could you?
We need time apart to think about us.
I'm not going to think.
Why start now?
I love you.
Look, baby, I am what I am, and I do what I do.
A few guys make shoelaces, some lay sod, some make a living neutering animals.
- I'm a cop.
- Pretty speech, Frank.
But my mind is made up.
I'm leaving.
All right.
Then take this with you.
You know how my lips feel about things.
(Doorbell)
Goodbye, Frank.
(Radio) 'You're listening to K-SAD, all-depressing, all the time.
'Here's a dedication to Frank from Jane, 'who just called from a taxi.
"'Frank, you lying weasel-weenie.
"'First you shoot blanks, now you're letting all the heat out..."'
He said he'd never go back to police work.
Once a cop, always a cop.
- He's married to his work.
- You'll always come in second.
There was an article in Cosmo - "Why all men are pigs".
"Frank" is just another word for loser.
I never want to see him again.
I want to get as far away as possible.
We'll go to my friend's cabin by the smelting plant.
The fresh air will do you good.
Go easy.
That's your second bottle of Chanel.
You're witnessing the beginning of a new Jane Spencer-Drebin.
No more little miss perky, devoting her life to one man.
I'm out for the new me.
Let's burn rubber.
- Didn't forget anything, did you?
- I hope not.
Just calm down, ma'am.
How many bodies did you find in your pool?
Sir, killing a gang member's only an $18 fine.
Just mail it in.
Frank!
Glad you could make it!
- Welcome, buddy.
- Nordberg.
Did you find Tanya's address, Frank?
I wrote it on a hanky, and I can't remember what I did with it.
- I'm getting a bit rusty.
- It could happen to anybody.
I brought you some of Frank's never-fail fudge!
You go on about your business.
I'll stay out of your hair.
it'll be...
Frank, let me take that.
We've got a surprise for you.
It's in honor of your thirty years on the force.
Nordberg.
Oh, boy.
This is really great.
Thank you, guys.
We thought it might cheer you up.
We heard about you and Jane.
Jane, Jane.
That name will always remind me of her.
Frank, I feel really bad about all of this.
If there's anything you need.
Dr Kevorkian's home phone number?
Nordberg, put it together.
- Frank, you know we're here for you.
- Thanks, Ed.
- Well, look who's here.
- Hi, Frank.
Nice to see you.
- I've got that data on the bomb.
- What did you find out?
The explosive is a very fine powder.
- It tastes like...
- That's fertilizer.
Another case.
This is what I'm talking about.
We detected a high quantity of nitroglycerine.
- Can you tell us where it came from?
- I'd be glad to.
Billions of years ago, the Earth was a molten mass...
Ted, I'm talking about the powder.
We don't know about that.
Let me take that urine specimen.
We found a list of the bomber's plans at the scene.
On a hunch, we analyzed the paper.
- And you got something?
- Yes.
The paper's from Statesville Prison.
Are you sure?
We analyzed the wood fibres and found them to be from the rare Canary island pine, which grows only in Oregon.
Contacting paper mills in that area led us to a distribution centre in Tacoma.
Unfortunately, the trail ended there.
- How'd you trace it to the prison?
- Right here on the letterhead.
After comparing handwriting of every known bomber serving a stretch in Statesville, we came up with a suspect - Rocco Dillon.
He's masterminding the bombings from inside the prison.
There's only one way to find out where Rocco will strike next.
We have to send someone in there.
- I'll do it.
- I wouldn't feel right about that.
If Rocco thinks you're a cop, you might end up dead.
"You might end up dead" is my middle name.
What about Jane?
I don't know her middle name.
I need the action.
I'm going inside the big house.
Frank, Ed.
I think you might want to see this.
We're testing out a prototype for an anti-carjacking device.
We'll see how it works.
- NO!
- Get out!
Don't make me...
Argh!
We call it the Denver jockstrap.
'After being retired for six months, I was finally back in action.
'Faster than saying "spread 'em", I was in Statesville Prison.
'I was surrounded by pimps, rapists and murderers.
'It was like being in the stands at an LA Raiders game.
'It was going to take all my police experience just to stay alive here.'
(Bell)
'After a long and generous cavity search,
'I reached my destination, Maximum Security - 'home of some of the most violent sociopaths in the country.
'And the worst of them all, Rocco Dillon.'
(Guard) All right, in here.
Ain't no prison yet could hold me.
Attica!
Attica!
Power to the brothers!
Kill whitey!
Kill whitey!
(Prisoner) Knock it off!
You're chirping loud for a new canary.
Keep flashing the big eyes, and I'll rotate your jaw.
Hey!
You know who you talking to?
The man is Rocco Dillon.
- Where's your prison number?
- It's unlisted.
Just call me Nick "The Slasher" McGirk.
Look, I'm the muscle in this pen.
Just stay out of my way.
You just watch your step, McGirk.
Take it from me, this place changes a man.
Yeah?
How?
I used to be white.
I was the drummer for the Osmonds.
Screw with me, he'll make you feel pain like never before.
I know.
I remember the Osmonds.
(Bell)
- Better hit the rack, McGirk.
- In a minute.
First I'm gonna make a list of who I'm gonna kill in the next few days.
(Guard) Lights out.
Lockdown in two minutes.
'My dearest snooky wookums dumpling buns,
'I miss you so much.
'I haven't hurt this bad since the last time I was dumped.
'I remember it well.
Her name was Gabriella.
'We were supposed to be married, 'but on the day of our wedding, she never showed up.
'I was heartbroken.
I figured she had fallen for another man, 'someone who could do to her what I never could.
'I thought my life was over until that one glorious day.
'That was the day you became my wife.
'Our friends gathered to celebrate our love.
'It seems like only yesterday.
'We were all so overjoyed.
'I remember wishing we could take everyone with us.
'That was the happiest day of my life.
'I remember the plans we made.
Things were going to be so perfect.
'We got that housekeeper you always wanted.'
Hi, Mr D. Hi, Mrs D.
'And I knew that eventually our dream would come true.
'One day we'd have our own Frank Drebin Jr.'
(Rocco) Shut up.
I'm trying to get some sleep.
'Nah, it's no use.
She'll never come back.'
(Growls like a lion)
# You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain #
# Too much love drives a man insane #
# You broke my will, but what a thrill #
# Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
#
# I laughed at love cos I thought it was funny #
# You came along and moved me, honey #
# I changed my mind, this love is fine #
# Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
#
Bend over and pick it up for me, would you, lover?
No problem.
'Rocco could tell from my escapade in the shower 'that I was well-endowed with courage.
'Now I had to get on the inside.
'Like a blind man at an orgy, I was going to have to feel things out.'
(Whispers) Tyrone, I got the escape plans right here.
Just you and me.
- Burnett wants in.
- Burnett's one of the guards!
I know, but he's unhappy here.
All right, all right.
Whatever.
Got it all worked out right here.
What's this?
Another letter from your mommy?
- That's private!
- Let's see what we have.
- Give the man back his letter.
- Buzz off, butter cheeks.
What's so special about a little letter?
Wait a minute...
An escape plan!
This is your ticket to another twenty years, Dillon.
If the warden gets one look at this...
Hey!
You call this slop?
Real slop has got chunks in it!
This is more like gruel!
And this Chateau le Blanc '68 is supposed to be served slightly chilled!
This is room temperature!
What do you think we are, animals?
(All) No!
What are we?
Homo sapiens?
You're right!
We are men!
We are men!
(All) We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
Left hand blue.
Whose hand is that?
Come on, son.
You can do it.
Eat some beans!
(Clang)
You saved my bacon, McGirk.
I'd be in solitary if you hadn't done that.
I've been watching you.
You handle yourself good.
- "Really well".
- Whatever.
I got something big on the outside.
I could use you in my gang.
- Dental plan?
- Full coverage.
- What's the caper?
- First we bust out.
Thanks to you, we still have our escape plan.
Let's have it.
- It's a good plan.
- I've had better.
Listen, I've got a foolproof plan.
They got Tyrone.
Can't...
Can't we all just get along?
'Now that Tyrone was in solitary, it was just me and Rocco.
'He had to trust me...
'Shh!
Hold on.
(Whispering) 'OK.
'I convinced Rocco to dig a tunnel.
'It was that or go out in a laundry truck.
'The thought of lying nose down in skidmarks 'didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.
'Disposing of the dirt was a problem I solved 'early in the construction.
'Apart from some chafing, we made good progress.
'We kept digging.
'Dummies gave the impression we were still in our cell.'
(Guard) Lights out.
'There was more dirt than I thought.
Disposing of it was becoming tricky.'
Safe!

Where are you going?
- Are you thinking of Frank again?
- They're playing our song.
I understand.
Take your time.
- Hello there.
- Excuse me.
I'm hauling a load of rice cakes to Big D. Coming with me?
No.
- How about a kiss?
- No.
When a woman says no, she means yes.
- How about that kiss?
- Yes.
No?
I know your type.
Come on, baby.
We're two of a kind.
Oh, my God!
You killed him!
it was an accident.
Call the police.
Come to your senses.
You killed a man.
You're a hero to every woman.
We have to call Frank.
He'll protect us.
Frank is a man.
He'll see you locked away forever.
Jane, I want to join you, to help you kill as many men as possible.
Yipes!
Louise, do what you have to do.
I'm calling Frank.
(Trucker) Oh, boy, did that hurt.
Be home, Frank.
Answer the phone.
- (Telephone picks up)
- Frank!
(Answer phone) 'Hi, this is Frank and Jane.
(Both) 'We're the Drebins.
We're not home right now so leave a message!
(Frank) 'Which button is it?
' (Jane) 'Not that one!
'
(Dial tone)
Tanya?
It WAS another woman.
Frank wasn't lying.
Honeymoon Bay Road.
I bet they're alone there now!
Frank!
Cell inspection.
There's been a rumour of a possible breakout.
If we suspect anyone of attempting to escape, they will be punished severely.
'Once word of the escape was out, we headed for the tunnel.
'The last few feet were dug on the run.
'Another forty-seven yards would take us beyond the prison walls.'
May he rest in peace, in the arms of our...
Jesus Christ!
(All) Amen.
(Frank) 'Rocco had arranged for a car to meet us.
'After making a slight adjustment 'we arrived at the rendezvous point - a Los Angeles city high school.
Hey, that was close.
Hey, Rocco, who's the old hag?
She take one in the face?
She's my mother.
Mrs Dillon.
Your son is a ruthless, sadistic, cold-blooded animal.
- You must be proud of him.
- I am.
I want you to meet a real square egg,
Nick "The Slasher" McGirk.
There's fresh clothes in the back.
'Rocco's mom was quiet.
I felt she didn't care for me coming along.
'Like a midget at a urinal,
'I was going to have to stay on my toes.'
Hey!
Stop!
Oh, Frank.
it wasn't my fault.
That cow shouldn't have been in the road.
Hurry up.
You're letting the flies in.
- What do you think?
- Great setup.
No phone, miles from the nearest town, Playboy channel - perfect.
Nice digs.
But I'm here for the action.
What is it?
Bank, armored car, payroll?
You're getting a little bit too nosy, McGirk.
Relax, Ma.
- She's itching to use her new gun.
- I know the feeling.
'It was Tanya.
That bathing suit was never happier.
'I had only a second to admire the view.
I had to watch out.
'If she made me as a cop, I'd be tonight's meat loaf.'
Come here, sexy.
You're all woman.
I could tell by looking at you.
Hey, she's referring to me.
I was talking about your mother.
(Mother) That's no way to be walking around.
Get some clothes on.
And what are you doing in my bathing suit?
Hey, who's the stud?
Meet the newest member of our gang.
Slasher McGirk, meet Tanya Peters.
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
I smelled cop on him the minute I saw him.
I get it all the time.
It's the underwear ads.
- Are you saying you're not a cop?
- Well, yeah.
- That's good enough for me.
- Me, too.
All right.
I'm glad that's all cleared up.
Ma, why not kiss and make up?
Well, all right.
Now that's more like it.
Uh!
Ow.
(Frank) 'I had to get a message to Police Squad.
'This was more than I could handle.
'No phone, miles from civilization, 'my prospects look bleaker than a gerbil's in a bat house.'
Who's down there?
Slasher...
Have you seen my pigeon?
- Pigeon?
What pigeon?
- What are you doing?
I'm...just contemplating my next move.
Your bishop is exposed.
It's these pants.
I usually wear a fuller cut.
You're all man.
I like that in my men.
You're coming on to me big-time, sister, but we got a problem.
- You're Jewish?
- No.
You're Rocco's girl.
in my book, that chapter's called, "Look, but don't touch."
I could have two lovers.
Kinky.
But I like my sex the way I play basketball - one-on-one and with as little dribbling as possible.
Oh, you're tense, Slasher.
Well, I could relax more if I knew about tomorrow.
You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
All I know is it's downtown and...big.
That's the way I like it.
- What else?
- Just this.
What are you doing?
Thank you for the advice.
I'll try that recipe, Miss Peters.
- How could you?
- Shove your tongue down his throat.
Oh!
Quiet.
You don't know me here.
That's a goodbye kiss, sister.
What's all this?
Who's the skirt?
Just some dizzy dame.
Probably broke down.
I'll take her to the bus depot.
Hey, she's married.
What if her husband comes looking?
- He must be a great guy.
- He breaks promises.
Look at you, traipsing all over, just to spite him.
- He left me.
- You left him.
- You should talk.
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you!
- Listen to you!
Jeez, you two, knock it off!
- You'd think you're married!
- What'll we do with her?
One thing's for sure.
There's no room for her here.
- I say we bump her off.
- Let's plug her here.
I've been on a job where I'd have given my eye teeth for a hostage.
We know women make the best hostages.
They're small, easy to move, eat less, smell nice.
Yeah, we got us an insurance policy.
Good thinking, kid.
Now, let's get some shuteye.
We got a big day ahead of us.
All right, it's rigged.
Watch the tower, Slasher.
This is what'll happen tonight.
Hey, aren't we far away?
Oh!
(Rocco) All right, pay attention.
On that tower's a device that's gonna net us five million bucks.
We're gonna detonate it this evening at an event that the whole world will be watching.
- Your crowning achievement.
- It's for both of us, Ma.
All set!
Set!
Very impressive.
Heh-heh-heh-heh.
Cool.
Heh-heh-heh-heh.
Cool.
America will be brought to its knees by this terrorist act.
This will be more embarrassing to the US than Tonya Harding.
We're almost there.
I don't wanna miss this.

Not bad!
- What's going to happen to me?

Nordberg, look!
That's Frank at the Academy Awards.
- How'd he get tickets?
- Nordberg!
That's where Rocco is going to strike next.
He's planning to blow up the Academy Awards.
- We've got to go.

We're cops.
It's for you.

Wing Wa Woo Tong... so that they might finally...be nice.
Thank you.
And the winner is...
Raquel, so many go to bed hungry in this nation.
Yet, cat food's full of tuna.
I can't help thinking each time I go to the zoo and see those porpoises crammed into tiny tanks, what a waste that is.
Butcher half of them now.
Hundreds of pounds of dolphin meat that could be fed to cats, freeing up that tuna for our nation's hungry.
- And the winner is...
- So many are...cold, shivering in the night.
I say take those cats and skin them.
Use their fur to keep hundreds warm.
Jesus, Phil!
And the winner is...
Give me that!

It's room temperature.

Oh, Mr Drebin, I want to go straight.
I'm tired of the lies.
Oh, kiss me.
Please kiss me.
I've never kissed lips so innocent,
So pure.
He looked like Phil Donahue, white hair...
- That's the guy!
- I'll get him.
(PA) 'Ladies and gentlemen, to present the best picture award, 'two distinguished actors, Olympia Dukakis and James Earl Jones.'
Lord, what's that?
Looks like Phil Donahue throwing up in a tuba.
I don't think we should have Phil Donahue back next year.
Thank you.
Good evening.
It's a privilege for us to present the final award...
We've been worried about you.
Where's Rocco?
Where's Tanya?
- Sit down.
Take it easy.
- Thank God you're all right.
"indecent instincts" and "Sawdust And Mildew".
Every one of these movies was a box office hit, except for one.
- What's that?
- The best picture award.
My money's on "Sawdust And Mildew".
Olympia, would you do the honors?
Oh, my God!
That's the one!
The award for this year's best picture goes to...
Wait!
Oh!
Sorry about this.
Loved you in "Cone heads".
You, too.
Let me open this.
(Beeping)
It's the bomb!
Freeze and nobody gets hurt!
Well...from now on.
Back in your seats, you little weasels!
This program's been interrupted.
Don't panic.
Stay with it.
Camera 2, move in on the old lady.
Better move back.
- Don't move!
- (Ma) Now, pay attention!
I don't want to kill nobody unless I have to.
Drop your guns and kick 'em over here.
That bomb belongs to me.
Hand it over, Drebin.
You want to kill him, Ma?
Blink and I start shooting.
(Frank) Give me that gun!
- Oh, my God!
- I'm not falling for that, sister.
I'm not well!
Get this stupid thing off me!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Ohh!
- Ma!
- She's a goner, Rocco.
Dead.
Then that's it.
I'm coming with you, Ma!
Pull out the bomb or I'll shoot the dame.
All right.
I'll do what you say.
- Frank!
- Don't harm her.
You pull out the bomb and you'll kill me anyway.
- Yeah.
No dice!
- Then I'll plug her.
- Shoot her, I'll empty the envelope.
- Frank, think about it.
It's all right.
You'll be dead.
Then you'll kill everyone here.
Yeah.
I'll shoot if you don't do as I say.
Jane?
I'd be safe, so would everyone else.
- But you'd be dead.
- This is complicated, Rocco.
Logically, you're psychotic, so you have the envelope, I'll have the gun.
- Frank?
!
- I know what I'm doing.
All right!
Here's your best picture!
In front of the world, this place is going up.
Well, if I'm going out, I'm going out happy.
Before we're all blown to bits, can I get my underwear out of my crack?
- I got to go comfortable.
- OK, but that's it.
- Give it up, Rocco.
You're history.
- Look, George Hamilton!
Come and get me, Drebin!
Throw me a gun!
Get rid of the bomb!
Hold on, sweetheart.
Frank, help!
- Frank.
- I know what I'm doing.
(Jane) I hate heights!
Ohh!
Oh, no!
Move it, sister!
Screw the commercials!
All right, copper, you killed my ma!
I'm taking the dame away from you.
You hear me, copper?
One push and Mrs Drebin is linoleum.
Get a camera up there.
This could be my best work.
Any last words before I throw you off?
- Yes.
Don't do it.
- Anything else?
Frank, I love you.
I want the world to know you're the perfect man.
Frank, I hope you can hear me.
They said I couldn't do drama.
I was wrong.
Taking you away from Police Squad was a mistake.
I know now that's why you couldn't perform decent sex.
I realize that now, and other things.
Everything's under control.
Nobody move!
Any vibration may set this thing off.
Frank, I've learned my lesson.
And though it may be too late for me,
I want all you ladies to remember something.
Don't ever take your men for granted, because good men don't just fall out of the sky.
Aah!
He's caught up in the cable!
Do something!
I'm coming, Ma!
Rocco?
Papshmir?
Jane...
- I never want us to be apart again.
- Oh, Frank!
You like me.
You really like me!
- Frank, slow down!
- Hurry up!
Relax.
There's time.
- You got the camcorder?
- Here.
Which room?
Delivery room.
This must be it.
Jane, I'm here.
Frank is here.
Push!
Here it comes now.
Breathe, honey.
Breathe, Jane.
One more push.
That's it.
Congratulations, Dad.
It's a boy!
Nordberg!
You come back here!
- Frank, it's a boy.
- I know!
# You're walkin' along the street #
# Or you're at a party #
# Or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig #
# You're lookin' in someone's eyes #
# You suddenly realize #

# There's no controlling' the unrolling' of your fate, my friend #

Hey, look!
It's the President!
And the Pope!
Oh, my God!
Look!
It's disgruntled postal workers.
Wait a minute!
Give me my baby back!
- Are you all right?
- I'm soaking wet.
- I'll get the talcum powder.
- It's not that.
I had a nightmare.
Crime all around me, I couldn't stop it.
- Frank, it was just a dream.
- You're right.
All I need is a good night's rest.
Tomorrow everything will be fine.
How's my little boy?
Getting along OK, sweetie?
As well as a heterosexual can in prison.
I don't know if I can take it any longer.
- How's Tanya?
- Tanya's the same.
Milky, creamy skin, pouting red lips, firm buttocks, ample breasts, ears you'd love to stick your tongue into...
- I'll get guy cramps if you keep this up.
- Sorry.
There's somebody here to see you.
Pahpshmir!
- My people are very upset.
- Of course, they're Arab terrorists.
You're supposed to be the world's best terrorist bomber.
- Train stations, government buildings.
- The devastation in South Florida.
- That was Hurricane Andrew.
- That's what they told the public.
We wanted to embarrass the USA.
You've made the police look like heroes.
I told you.
A first-class job would cost five million.
If you want to step up the price,
I got a target that'll make City Hall look like chicken feed.
A big target.
Why should anything be different?
Because five million dollars buys me!
I'm breaking out of here.
If you fail this time, Mr. Dillon, my people won't be so forgiving.
Fail?
Show me one man who can stop me.
Attention shoppers, be sure to check out our special on paper towels.
That's aisle seven.
Hey!
- Give it to me!
- My purse!
Somebody help me!
- Let go of the purse, lady!
- Help me!
For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow which nobody can deny.
Well, we shot a lot of people together.
It's been great.
Today I retire.
If I do any shooting now, it'll have to be in my own home.
Hopefully, it'll be an intruder and not an in-law like at my bachelor party.
Ed, I officially give you my gun and my badge.
And...
Jane and I would like to keep the handcuffs as a souvenir.
Cheer up, Ed.
This is not goodbye.
This is just "I won't ever see you again".
- Somebody help me!
- Out of my way!
- It.
Drebin!
Frank!
Didn't you see that?
- What?
Oh...
Yes, kitty litter.
Two bags for a dollar.
Great!
Order.
The jury will disregard that last statement.
Continue, counselor.
- The alimony had been set by the court.
- Yes, but...
You haven't paid alimony in two years, repeatedly defying a court order.
- Isn't that right, Mr. Clayton?
- I'd lost her address.
She moved twice.
Don't lie to me.
You're under oath.
Do you know what the penalty for perjury is?
- I'll ask you that again.
- Objection!
Your Honor, I...
Ow, ow, gee.
- Counsel is leading the witness.
- Sustained!
Mommy said no pounding when she's in session.
Read the prosecution's last statement.
"Don't lie to me, Mr. Clayton.
You're under oath." Good boy.
"Do you know what the penalty for perjury is?"
That's all I have, Your Honor.
You may continue, Ms Spencer-Drebin.
Prosecution rests.
Defense Attorney Ms Davies-Jacobs-Steiner-Lazlo.
No further questions.
Court will recess until after the morning feeding.
- We can win this.
I can feel it.
- Yes, of course.
- I married the wrong man.
- I never thought that was possible.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, nothing.
Louise, there's no such thing as the wrong man.
You just have to work at it.
Now, let's see.
Mr. and Mrs. Drebin, right?
Now, you two have been married for six months?
Yes.
We really appreciate you seeing us, Doctor.
Our last therapist recommended you.
Yes, I was sorry to hear about his suicide.
A couple need to get off on the right foot and not get caught up in blame.
- Now, which one of you is impotent?
- That would be him.
Yes, of course.
- Why don't you ask who's frigid?
- That would be him.
- How would you know?
- He resents that I'm a working woman.
He has no idea what a woman wants or needs.
- You're so insensitive.
- Is this that toilet seat thing?
I want to have a baby.
Every time we make love, you have a headache.
I'm not a piece of meat.
I'm trying!
I've got ointments, lotions, creams, books, things that vibrate...
- Frank!
- Maybe it's your fault.
Have you tried sexy lingerie?
Lacy underwear?
A black teddy?
- I've tried them all.
They don't work.
- Oh!
Why don't you want a child?
Didn't I try to adopt that 18-year old Korean girl?
Jane, Frank, here's what I suggest.
Make tonight a special night.
Dinner, wine, romantic music.
Put on the 24-hour Johnny Mathis station.
Just be Jane and Frank.
Lovers!
We haven't had a night like that in a long time.
- Not together.
- Frank!
Jane, having a baby is a big responsibility.
Like being in charge of sanitation at a Haitian jail.
I'm just frightened.
Let's make tonight something special.
Oh, honey, it's just that I love you so much.
My little lover sparrow.
My puppy wuppy wuvver.
My little love biscuit.
- My little snookie wookums.
- My little lady cheesy puffy.
Mr. and Mrs. Drebin, please, I'm a diabetic.
I think you ought to go now.
- I never thought we'd end this way.
- How did you think we'd end?
I don't know.
Some other way.
Oh, Jason, please...
Bobbi...
- I've been hurt before.
- We have to fight this thing together.
Ed, Nordberg!
It's been a long time!
- Good to see you, buddy.
- You look terrific.
I'm taking a step class, and I got a thigh master for Christmas.
Where are my manners?
Come on in!
- How charming!
- Sit, sit.
Excuse the mess.
It's my ironing day.
I've just frosted some cupcakes.
- Would you care for one?
- Not now.
We're having trouble with a terrorist threat.
- Police Squad is certain that...
- I'd love a cupcake.
- That coffee smells great.
- I grind my own beans.
We're here because we need your help with something.
- They're great!
- I'd hoped you'd like them.
Made from scratch.
I'll just get off my feet.
We may have a lead on a suspect in the City Hall bombing attempt.
These were taken by a photographer.
- She was used as a diversion.
- We've had them enlarged.
- They look familiar.
- No, Frank, the pin.
She's a nurse.
Can I keep this one?
We traced her to the Karlson Clinic on Myrtlewood.
Her name is Tanya Peters.
- Do you know her?
- Don't you remember back in the 70s?
The big disco shoot out.
Hey, Ed.
What's happening, my man?
We missed you last night at the fondue party.
Couldn't make it.
I saw the Village People.
They're gas.
- Far out, I can dig it!
- What's this?
One dead disco dancer.
- Bummer!
What a mind bender.
- We think it was a love triangle.
This is the suspect's girlfriend, Tanya Peters.
- Cigarette?
- Yes, I know.
We'll need a statement from you down at the station.
- Nordberg!
- Coming, lieutenant!
I do remember!
You were one of the first test cases for minoxidol.
- What?
- I'm glad I could be of help.
If you don't mind, I've got a rump of lamb to roast.
- We need a favor.
- It's not that big a rump roast.
It's not that.
We need you to go undercover at the clinic.
I've quit police work.
You're whistling up the wrong neck of the woods.
I wouldn't ask, but we're in a bind.
- What about Hedges and O'Malley?
- They're in Hawaii... together.
I can't.
Jane and I have a special evening planned.
It'll only take a few hours.
Still time to make dinner.
I don't know.
I'll have to make pork chops.
Think of all the crime.
Nobody is safe.
You'd be protecting Jane.
You'd be protecting all the Janes of the world.
- You haven't shot anybody in 6 months.
- That's true.
Funny how you miss the little things.
Might be good to feel cold steel against my thigh again.
The thrill of a chase... to be a man!
After folding the laundry, I set out for the clinic.
Police operations require a foolproof disguise.
This operation was no different.
I had no idea if Tanya would recognize me, so I wore fake glasses.
I combed my hair differently, just in case.
I planned to get in and find out about Tanya's connection with the bombing, and get out as quickly as possible.
I figured faking an old football injury would do the trick.
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see a doctor.
Sign in here, please.
Do you have an appointment, Mr.?
Smith.
No, I don't.
- Then take a number.
- Six.
- What?
- Is six taken?
Does it have to be between one and ten?
- You'll be called.
- Thank you.
Mr. Smith?
We've had a cancellation.
We can take you now.
Dr. Kohlzak?
Good morning, Mr. Smith.
Right this way.
I appreciate you seeing me.
I'm sure it won't take too long.
- When did you first notice the problem?
- In the back yard with my uncle.
- In the back yard?
With your uncle?
- Yes, when he visits we like to go out in the back yard and throw it around.
What did you and your uncle find out?
I can't keep up with him.
Mine hurt, especially on the long ones.
I can't seem to straighten it out.
It has no feeling.
It's kind of numb.
I may have yanked it too much, maybe.
- If you would...
- For what?
- A sperm count.
- In here?
It's not exactly the back yard, but it will do.
Well...
Follow me, and we'll do the necessary paperwork.
Sign these at the bottom, and leave them with the nurse.
- This way, please.
- What?
- Number 17.
- A problem?
- No.
- This is 17.
You're next.
- Have we met before?
- If you excuse me, I'm next.
Sir...
Mr. Smith, how are we doing?
I've been busy, if that's what you mean.
Would you like a video tape to assist you?
Do you have "Dances With Wolves"?
"Rocketeer"? "Lady And The Tramp"?
An adult movie.
The tape was very entertaining.
Follow me.
Do you have "Spartacus"?
Maintenance, clean up Room 7.
Maintenance, clean up Room 7.
Stat.
- What are you doing?
- Freshening up.
You should always look your best, even by yourself.
Are you sure we've never met?
Oh, here's my cup.
Back to work.
Mr. Smith, are you OK in there?
I could use a little help.
Dr. Rosenblatt, foreplay in Room 7, please.
Honey, I've been waiting all day.
I'm wearing the nightgown you bought me for our honeymoon.
Tonight's gonna be special.
I'll make love to you for hours and hours.
Wouldn't Mr. Happy like that?
- Hours?
- Like our first time together.
Why don't I get ready and soak in the tub for a couple of days?
Possibly a week.
So cute!
Let me go and get the oysters and clams.
Here.
I'll shave your back like last time.
Jane, I really don't think we should.
- Frank, what's this?
!
- I fell... on a rake.
You're lying.
Now I know why Ed's been calling.
- You've been back on the case.
- No, I swear.
It's another woman.
In your wildest dreams!
It's bad enough you won't have a baby.
I warned you against working again.
You white Anglo male!
Jane, it was nothing.
I was only doing Ed a small favor.
Some retirement!
I'm leaving.
I never thought you'd go back on your word.
- Aren't you being a little hasty?
- I don't think so.
That's the cab.
You can reach me at Louise's.
How could you?
We need some time apart to think about us.
I'm not going to think.
Why now?
I love you.
Look, I am what I am, and I do what I do.
Some make shoelaces, some make a living neutering animals.
- I am a cop.
- Pretty speech.
My mind is made up, I'm leaving!
All right, then take this with you.
I guess you know how my lips feel about things.
Goodbye, Frank.
Your listening to K.S.A.D. All depressing, all the time.
Here's a dedication to Frank from Jane calling from a taxi.
You not only shoot blanks, you leave the door open, letting the heat out.
Were you born in a barn?
He wouldn't do any more police work.
Once a cop, always a cop.
- He's married to his work, not me.
- You'll come second.
There's an article in Cosmo, "Why All Men Are Pigs".
Read it!
Frank's just another word for "loser".
I never want to see him again.
I want to get far away from here.
We'll go to my friend's cabin.
The fresh air will do you good.
Go easy!
That's your second bottle of Chanel.
This is the beginning of a new Jane Spencer-Drebin.
No more Miss Perky who devoted her life to one man.
I'm out for the new me.
Let's burn rubber!
- Have you forgotten anything?
- I hope not.
Calm down.
How many bodies did you find in your pool?
In this state killing a gang member is only an $18 fine.
- Frank!
Glad you could make it.
- Welcome, buddy.
- Nordberg, Ed.
- Did you find Tanya's address?
I wrote it down on a hanky, and I can't remember what I did with it.
- I'm getting rusty.
- That could happen to anybody.
I brought you some of "Frank's Never Fail Fudge".
- Go on about your business.
- Smells great.
- I'll stay out of your hair.
- It'll be just like...
Frank, let me get that.
We have a surprise for you.
In honor of your 30 years on the force.
Nordberg!
Oh, boy.
This is really great.
Thank you, guys.
It might cheer you up.
We heard about you and Jane.
Jane, Jane...
The name will always remind me of her.
I feel bad about this.
If there's anything you need?
- Like Dr. Kevorkian's home number.
- Nordberg, put it together!
- We're here for you.
- Thanks.
- Look who's here.
Nice to see you.
- Ted.
- I have data for you on the bomb.
- What did you find out?
- The explosive is a very fine powder.
- It tastes like...
That's fertilizer.
It's for another case.
This is what I'm talking about.
- We detected nitroglycerine.
- Can you tell us where it came from?
I'd be glad to.
Billions of years ago, the earth was a molten mass...
- I mean the powder.
- We have no clue.
Let me take that urine, Frank.
We found a list of the bomber's plans at the scene.
- We analyzed the paper.
- And?
The paper is from Statesville Prison.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
The wood is from the rare Canary Island Pine.
It only grows in Oregon.
Contacting paper mills led us to a distribution center in Tacoma.
There the trail ended.
- How did you trace it to Statesville?
- The letterhead.
We compared the handwriting of all bombers serving in Statesville and found a suspect, Rocco Dillon.
He's masterminding the bombings from the prison.
If so, there's only one way to find out where Rocco'll strike next.
- We'll have to send someone in prison.
- I'll do it.
I wouldn't feel right about that.
If Rocco finds out, you might end up dead.
"You might end up dead" is my middle name.
- What about Jane?
- I don't know hers.
I need the action.
I'm going inside the big house.
Frank, Ed, you might want to see this.
We're testing a prototype for a new anti-carjacking device.
You'll get to see how it works.
- Get out!
- No.
Don't make me use...
"The Denver Jockstrap".
After being retired for six months, I was back in action.
Faster than you say "Spread 'em!", I was inside Statesville Prison.
I was surrounded by pimps, rapists and murderers.
It was like being in the stands of an LA Raiders' game.
It was going to take all my police experience just to stay alive in here.
After a long and generous cavity search, I reached my destination:
Maximum security, home of some of the country's most violent sociopaths.
And the worst of them all, Rocco Dillon.
All right, in here.
Ain't no prison yet could hold me.
Attica!
Attica!
Power to the brothers.
Kill whitey, kill whitey!
Knock it off!
You're chirping loud for a new canary.
Keep flashing your eyes, and I'll balance your jaw.
Hey!
You know who you're talking to?
The man is Rocco Dillon.
- Where's your prison number?
- It's unlisted.
Just call me Nick "The Slasher" Magirk.
Look, ham head.
I'm the muscle in this pen.
Stay out of my way.
Just watch your step, Magirk.
Take it from me, this place changes a man.
- Oh, yeah, in what way?
- I used to be white.
I was the drummer for the Osmonds.
Screw with me, he'll make you feel pain you've never felt before.
I know, I remember the Osmonds.
- Better hit the rack, Magirk.
- In a minute.
First I'll make a list of the people I'm gonna kill in the next few days.
Lights out!
Lock down in two minutes!
My dearest snookie wookums buns,
I miss you so much.
I haven't felt this bad since... the last time I was dumped.
I remember it well.
Her name was Gabriella.
We were supposed to marry, but on our wedding day, she never showed up.
I was heartbroken, destroyed.
I figured she'd fallen for another man.
Someone who could do to her what I never could.
I thought my life was over until that one glorious day.
That was the day you became my wife.
All our friends celebrated our love.
It seemed like only yesterday.
We were all so overjoyed.
We wished they all could come with us.
That was the happiest day of my life.
I'll never forget the plans we made.
Things were going to be perfect.
We were going to get that housekeeper you always wanted.
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. D.
I knew that eventually our dream would come true.
One day we'd have our own Frank Drebin Jr.
Shut up, Magirk.
I'm trying to sleep.
It's no use.
She'll never come back.
Bend over and pick it up for me would you, lover?
No problem.
Rocco could tell from my escapade in the shower that I was courageous.
Now, I had to get on the inside.
Like a blind man at an orgy, I would have to feel things out.
Tyrone, I've got the escape plans here.
Just you and me.
- Burnett wants in, too.
- He's a guard!
- I know, but he's unhappy here.
- All right, whatever.
Got it all worked out right here.
What's this?
Another letter from your mommy?
- That's private, screw.
- Let's have a look.
- Give him back his letter.
- Buzz off, butter cheeks.
What's so special about a little letter?
Wait a minute... an escape plan!
This is your ticket to another 20 years.
If the Warden gets one look...
You call this slop?
Real slop has got chunks of things in it.
This is more like gruel!
This Chateau LeBlanc '68 is supposed to be served slightly chilled.
This is room temperature.
- What do you think we are?
Animals?
- No!
What are we?
Homo sapiens?
You're right!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
No, no.
Stop!
Right hand red, left hand blue.
Who's got a hand in my pocket?
Come on, son.
You can do it.
Eat some beans.
You saved my bacon.
I'd be in solitary if you hadn't done that.
You've been handling yourself really good.
- Really well.
- Whatever.
I've got something big coming up.
I could have use for you.
You've got a dental plan?
What's the caper?
We've got to bust out of this playpen.
Thanks to you, we have an escape plan.
- It's a good plan.
- I've had better.
Listen, I've got a foolproof plan.
They've got Tyrone.
Can't we all just get along?
Now that Tyrone was in solitary, it was just me and Rocco.
He had no choice but to trust me...
Shh!
Hold on!
Anyway, I convinced Rocco to dig a tunnel.
It was either that or the laundry truck.
The thought of lying nose down in underwear with skid marks didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.
Disposing of the dirt was a problem I solved early.
Outside of some major chaffing, we made good progress.
We kept digging, and dummies gave the impression we were in our cell.
Lights out, Magirk.
There was more dirt than I anticipated.
Disposing of it was tricky.
Safe!
Where are you going?
Are you thinking of Frank again?
- They are playing our song.
- I understand.
Take your time.
- Hello, there.
- Excuse me.
I'm hauling a load of rice cakes to Big D.
- Why don't you come?
- No.
- How about a kiss?
- No!
I know women mean "yes" when they say "no".
How about that kiss?
- Yes.
- What do you mean "no"?
Come on, baby, we're two of a kind.
- You killed him!
- It was an accident.
Call the police.
Come to your senses.
You killed a man.
You're a hero to all American women!
Call Frank.
He'll protect us.
He's a man.
He'll lock you away for life.
I wanna help you kill as many men as possible.
Do what you have to do.
I'm calling Frank.
Be home, Frank, please.
Answer the phone, snuggle pants.
Frank!
- Hi, this is Frank.
- And Jane.
We're the Drebins.
We're not home right now.
Leave a message.
- Which button do I press?
- Not that one.
Tanya?
It was another woman.
Frank was telling the truth.
Honeymoon Bay Road, I bet they're there right now.
Oh, Frank!
Cell inspection!
There's been a rumor of a possible break-out.
If we suspect anyone of attempting to escape, they will be punished severely.
Once word of the escape was out, we had to move for the tunnel.
The last few feet had to be dug on the run.
We were sure that another 47 yards would take us beyond the prison walls.
May he rest in peace in the arms of our loving...
Jesus Christ!
Amen.
Rocco had arranged for a getaway car to meet us.
After adjusting our direction, we arrived at the rendezvous point a Los Angeles city high school.
Hey, that was close.
Hey, Rocco, who's the old hag?
- She take one in the face?
- She's my mother!
Mrs. Dillon, your son is a ruthless, sadistic, cold-blooded animal.
- You must be very proud of him.
- I am.
Ma, I want you to meet a real square egg, Nick "The Slasher" Magirk.
There are fresh clothes in the back.
Rocco's mother was quiet.
I sensed she didn't like me coming along.
Like a midget at a urinal, I would have to stay on my toes.
Hey!
Stop!
Oh, Frank!
It wasn't my fault.
That cow shouldn't have been on the road.
Hurry up, you're letting the flies in!
- What do you think, kid?
- Sweet setup.
No phones.
Miles from the nearest town.
Playboy Channel.
Perfect.
Nice digs, but I'm here for the action.
Are we taking banks or armored cars?
- You're getting too nosy, Magirk.
- Relax, Ma.
- She's been itching to try this gun.
- I know the feeling.
It was Tanya.
That bathing suit was never happier.
I had only a second to admire the view.
I had to watch out.
If she made me as a cop, I'd be tonight's meat loaf.
- Come here, sexy.
- You're all woman.
I can tell.
Hey, she's referring to me.
I was talking about your mother.
That's no way to be walking around.
Get clothes on.
And what are you doing in my bathing suit?
- Hey, who's the stud?
- Meet our newest gang member.
Slasher Magirk, meet Tanya Peters.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
I smelt cop the minute I saw him.
I get that all the time.
The underwear ads.
Are you saying you're not a cop?
Well, yeah.
- That's good enough for me.
- I'm fine.
I'm glad that's all cleared up.
Ma, why don't you two kiss and make up?
Well, all right.
That's more like it.
I had to get a message to the squad.
This was more than I could handle by myself.
No phone and miles from people, I was worse off than a gerbil in a bath house.
Who's there?
Slasher, have you seen my pigeon?
Pigeon?
What pigeon?
- What are you doing?
- I'm just contemplating my next move.
Your bishop is exposed.
It's these pants.
I usually wear a fuller cut.
You're all man.
I like that in my men.
You're coming on to me big time, purring like a kitten with a mouse.
- But we got a problem.
- You're Jewish?
No.
You're Rocco's girl.
In my book that chapter is called "Look, But Don't Touch".
I could have two lovers.
Kinky.
But I like my sex the way I play basketball, one on one and with as little dribbling as possible.
You're tense, Slasher.
I could relax more, if I knew what was on tomorrow.
Do you know anything about that?
All I know is that it's downtown and... big.
That's the way I like it.
What else?
Just this...
- What are you doing?
- Thank you for the advice.
- I'll try that recipe out, Ms Peters.
- How could you?
You shove your tongue as far down as you can.
Quiet.
You're not supposed to know me here.
That's a goodbye kiss, sister.
- What's this?
Who's the skirt?
- Just some dizzy dame.
Her car broke down.
I'll take her to the bus.
Look, she's married.
What if her husband comes here?
- He will.
He must be great.
- He breaks promises.
And you traipse all over to spite a wonderful guy.
- He left me.
- You left him.
- You should talk!
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you!
- Listen to you!
You two, knock it off!
You'd think you were married.
- What do you want to do with her?
- One thing is for sure there's no room for her here.
- I say we bump her off.
- Let's plug her.
- No.
I was on a job that went hooey.
I'd have given my eyeteeth for a hostage.
Women make the best ones.
They are smaller, easy to take along, eat less, smell nice.
Yeah, we got us an insurance policy.
Good thinking, kid.
Come on, let's get some shut-eye.
We got a big day ahead of us.
It's rigged.
Keep your eye on the tower.
- It's what's going to happen tonight.
- Aren't we awfully far away?
On the top of that tower is a device that's going to net us five million bucks.
A thing I've been working on.
We'll detonate it this evening at an event the whole world will be watching.
- Your crowning achievement.
- It's for both of us, Ma.
- All set?
- Set.
Very impressive.
Cool.
Cool.
America will be brought to its knees by this terrorist act.
It'll be more embarrassing to the US than Tonya Harding.
We're there.
Give my regards to Mrs. Gaddafi.
And tell her thanks for the cookies.
It's another beautiful night in LA, and the stars are shining bright for the 66th annual Academy Awards.
Fans are clamoring to see their favorite celebrities.
Here are two, "Weird Al" Yankovic and Vanna White.
Slasher, put the dame in the trunk.
I'll meet you and Ma around the back in ten minutes.
Got the passes?
- We pull this up, it's 5 million big ones.
- Not bad, Ma.
- What's going to happen to me?
- I have an idea.
- Slasher, you know what to do.
- Right.
Check the spare tire and all fluid levels.
No, keep an eye on the dame.
We hit trouble, she's a bullet shield.
Ladies and gentlemen, to present the Academy's Lifetime Achievement...
Ready, 3.
Roll tape.
Go to clip.
Aspirin, please.
Go to 3.
Ready, 4.
This year's Lifetime Achievement Award winner's credits include great films.
"Sandals and Loincloth", 1958.
"Sweaty Boatmen", 1959.
"The Leather Clad Centurion", 1960, and his first color feature in 1966, "Big Shiny Spears".
There's the man from Bryce/Porterhouse.
He guards the envelopes until they're handed out.
He won't budge from there.
Distract him so I can plant the bomb in an envelope.
Accepting the award for Mr. Bronkowitz is Margaret Red Feather.
That ought to do it.
You'll pay for this.
Rocco'll kill you whoever you are.
- Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Isn't that a little unusual?
- It happened to me.
Here's the plan.
- You'll never stop Rocco.
- Your chances are one in a million.
- Better than any state lottery.
I'm the good guy.
I can't let the bad guys win.
Our children can't be raised in fear.
If we can't stop them, they'll blow that place up.
It'll be a tragedy, unless it happens during a dance number.
Come on.
Does that radio work?
Call Police Squad.
Tell them Frank Drebin...
Forget it.
I wonder what the devil he wanted?
- Hold on.
- Sergeant Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Yeah, and I'm Robert De Niro.
- Mr. De Niro, we've got to get inside.
You and 10,000 other people.
Move along.
Movie stars only.
Come on.
I've got a better idea.
And cue talent.
To present the award for Best Supporting Actress Mariel Hemingway and Elliot Gould.
Thank you.
The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are:
Mary Lou Retton, "Fatal Affair", one woman's ordeal to overcome the death of her cat, set against the background of the Hindenburg disaster.

Sorry, but this is official police business.
Shannen Doherty, "Basic Analysis", one woman's triumph over a yeast infection, set against the background of the tragic Buffalo Bill season of 1991.
Thank you, sheriff.
Still no word of Frank or Rocco's gang.
I'm worried.
He should've phoned in.
Let me check your tickets.
Lovely gown.
Is that Cool Whip?
All right, Tim and Erica Brown.
OK, enjoy the show.
Let's see.
Vanna White and "Weird Al" Yankovic.
OK!
Ready, 3... and 3.
And Florence Henderson, "Analysis of a Proposal"...
- Rocco could be anywhere.
- He's had time to plant the bomb.
- And the winner is...
- This is going to be dynamite.
- Jane.
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yes.
Florence Henderson'll win.
It's about time.
- No, the bomb is in an envelope.
- You're right!
And the winner is Mary Lou Retton for "Fatal Affair".
I'm sorry, we were rooting for Florence Henderson.
We've got to get to the envelopes.
- So many.
- They added 75 categories.
"Best Actor in a Columbus movie"?
Best Director is presented by star of stage and screen Raquel Welch and host of his own award-winning talk show Phil Donahue.
That might be the envelope for the bomb.
Keep looking here.
One more second, Mr. Donahue.
Oh, my God!
Look at Donahue.
Stop the stairs, Joey.
Joey!
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to present the...
What the hell?
!
- Jesus!
- Go to commercial.
Easy now.
Talk to me.
What happened, Ma?
Slasher is Frank Drebin of Police Squad.
Lousy, two-bit copper!
I treated him like my brother... the one I didn't kill.
- He might find the bomb.
- Not if I find him first.
- Back from commercial in 5 seconds.
- Hurry up with the mike.
Cue Donahue.
Read it.
Read the card, moron.
"Well, Raquel, this certainly is a special evening.
Phew!"
"I can barely catch my breath.
Turn it over to Raquel."
"Raquel:
I'm used to being out of breath, working out to my..."
What's he doing?
!
"Hold for laughter.
To Phil.
Gets me out of breath just watching you."
- "To Raquel.
Oh, Phil..."
- I'm supposed to read that.
"Let's get to the subject at hand.
Pick up the envelope..."
The nominees for best director are:
Sir Richard Attenborough for his musical based on the life of Mother Teresa, "Mother".
Food, I love food and I'm really in the mood for a big corn dog of pooh-pooh platter two ding-dongs, it doesn't matter and some tuna helper, I'll be racing back for more
But don't get any sausage 'cause I'll blow chunks on the floor
Spike Lee, "X II
- The Merchandising"
Nordberg, look.
That's Frank at the Academy Awards.
How did he get tickets?
That's where Rocco Dillon is going to strike next, the Academy Awards.
- We have to get there.
- We're not invited.
We're cops.
- It's for you.
- Nordberg, Police Squad.
Hello.
Hello.
Henderson, see about this phone.
I think it's broke.
And now, here are today's lucky lotto numbers.
Get your tickets ready because here they come: 12, 22, 18 and 9.
And for his tale of genetics gone haywire in a retirement community,
Steven Spielberg, "Geriatric Park".
And the winner is...
- Raquel, just a second.
- Now what?
- I just had a thought.
- Oh, Christ.
This show is being seen all over the world, I was thinking if we could all send good thoughts through these cameras to men like the leader of China, Wing Wa Woo Tong, so that they might finally be nice.
Thank you.
And the winner is...
Raquel, so many go to bed hungry in this nation, yet cat food is full of tuna.
Each time I go to the zoo and see those porpoises crammed into tiny tanks,
I think, "What a waste that is."
Butcher half of them now!
That's a lot of dolphin meat that can be fed to our cats, freeing up that tuna for our nation's hungry.
- And the winner is...
- So many are cold, shivering in the night.
So I say, "Take those cats, skin them."
- "Use their fur to keep hundreds warm."
- Jesus, Phil.
And the winner is...
- You!
- Give me that!
- Not one move.
- That barrel's cold.
It's OK.
It's not the bomb.
- Jane.
Jane!
- Big trouble!
Jane.
Silver hair.
Kind of looked like Phil Donahue.
That's the guy!
Please welcome internationally renowned actress and singing star
Pia Zadora.
- Excuse me, is that snot on your shoe?
- Snot?
Where?
Oh, no.
Not him again.
Please, God.
Get off the stage!
Ed Hocken and Nordberg from Police Squad.
- We're here to prevent a disaster.
- Too late for that.
It's Frank.
Come on, Nordberg.
We've got to get to Frank.
Jane!
Jane!
I knew I'd bump into you somewhere.
I want answers, cherry cakes.
- I love you.
- Wrong answer.
I quit the Sap-of-the-Month Club long ago.
Angel drawers, you've got one last chance.
Not one of those Major-League- Baseball-Steve-Howe last chances.
- Where is Jane?
- I swear I don't know.
- Where is the bomb?
- In the Best Picture envelope.
Oh, Mr. Drebin, I want to go straight.
I'm tired of the lies.
Oh, kiss me.
Please, kiss me.
I've never kissed lips so innocent, so pure.
He looked like Phil Donahue.
White hair.
That's the guy.
To present the Best Picture Award are two very distinguished actors.
Olympia Dukakis and James Earl Jones.
- Oh, Lord.
What's that?
- Phil Donahue throwing up in a tuba.
Make a note about not having Phil Donahue back next year.
Thank you.
Good evening.
It's a privilege to present the final award of tonight's ceremony.
We've been worried about you.
Where's Rocco and Tanya?
- Sit down.
Take it easy.
- Thank God you're all right.
"Indecent Instincts" and "Sawdust and Mildew".
Oddly enough, all these movies are box office hits, except one.
- What's that?
- It's the Best Picture Award.
Olympia, would you do the honors?
Oh, my God.
That's the one!
The award for this year's best picture goes to...
- Wait!
- Oh, great.
Sorry.
Loved you in "Coneheads".
You, too.
Let me open this.
It's the bomb!
Freeze, and nobody gets hurt!
Well, from now on.
Take your seats, the party's over!
This programme's been stopped.
OK, don't panic.
Camera 2, move in on the old lady.
Better move back, 2.
- I said, "Nobody moves."
- Sit down and pay attention!
I don't want to kill anybody unless I have to.
Drop your guns and kick them over here.
I believe that bomb belongs to me.
Hand it over, Drebin.
You want to do the honors of killing him, Ma?
Blink, and I start shooting.
Give me that gun.
- Oh, my God!
- I'm not falling for that one, sister.
- Ma!
- She's a goner, Rocco.
Dead?
Then that's it.
I'm coming with you, Ma!
- Pull out the bomb, or I'll shoot her.
- All right, Rocco.
All right.
I'll do what you say.
Just don't harm her.
You pull out the bomb, you'll kill me and everyone else.
- No dice, Rocco.
- Then I'll plug her.
- If you do, I'll empty this envelope.
- Frank, think about it.
- It's all right, you'll be dead.
- You'll kill yourself and everyone here.
- Yeah.
- I'll shoot you if you don't do as I say.
- Jane?
- I'd be safe.
So would everyone else.
- But you'd be dead.
- This is getting a little complicated.
Let's be logical.
You're the psycho, you should have this and I the gun.
I know what I'm doing.
All right.
Here's your Best Picture, in front of a worldwide audience.
- This place is going up.
- If I'm going out, I'm going out happy.
Wait, Rocco, before we're all blown to bits.
Mind if I pull the underwear out of my crack?
A man's got to go comfortable.
All right, but that's it.
- Give it up, Rocco, you're history!
- Look, George Hamilton!
Come and get me.
Throw me a gun.
Get rid of the bomb.
Hold on.
Frank, help me!
- Frank!
- I know what I'm doing.
I hate heights.
Move it.
Screw the commercials!
All right, copper.
You killed my ma.
I'm taking the dame away from you.
You hear me, copper?
One push and Mrs. Drebin is linoleum.
Get a camera up there.
This could be my best work!
- Any last words before I throw you off?
- Yes, don't do it.
- Anything else?
- Frank, I love you.
I want the world to know you're the perfect man.
- Frank, I hope you can hear me.
- They told me I couldn't do drama.
I was wrong to take you away from Police Squad.
I know now that's why you couldn't perform sexually.
I realize that and a lot of other things now.
Everything's under control.
Nobody moves!
Any vibration might set this thing off.
Frank, I've learned my lesson.
Even though it may be too late for me, I want all ladies out there to remember:
Don't ever take your men for granted.
Good men don't just fall out of the sky.
He's caught up in the cable.
Frank, do something.
Hurry.
I'm coming, Ma!
- Rocco?
- Pahpshmir?
Jane, I never want us to be apart again.
Oh, Frank, you like me, you really like me.
- Frank, slow down.
- Hurry up, we're late!
- Relax.
Did you bring the camcorder?
- Right here.
- What room is she in?
- Delivery room.
This must be it.
Jane, I'm here.
Frank is here now.
- Push!
Bear down now.
- Breathe, honey.
One more push.
That's it.
Congratulations, Dad.
It's a boy.
Nordberg!
Come back here!
- Frank, it's a boy.
- I know!
" ThE EnD "
Hey, look!
It's the President!
And the Pope!
Yee-aah!
Yah!
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la!
Oh, my God!
Look!
It's disgruntled postal workers!
Wait a minute!
Give me my baby back!
Aah!
Aah!
- Frank!
Frank, are you all right?
- I'm soaking wet.
- I'll get the talcum powder.
- No, I had a nightmare.
There was crime all around me.
I couldn't stop it.
- It was a dream.
- You're right.
All I need is a good rest.
in the morning everything'll be fine.
How's my little boy?
Getting along OK, sweetie?
As well as a heterosexual can in prison.
I don't know how much longer I can take it.
- How's Tanya?
- Tanya's the same.
Milky, creamy skin, pouting red lips, firm buttocks, ample breasts, ears you want to stick your tongue into.
Ma!
I'll get guy cramps!
Sorry.
Rocco, there's somebody here to see you.
Papshmir.
My people are very upset.
They're always upset.
They're Arab terrorists.
Ma, please.
You're supposed to be the best terrorist bomber in the world.
Stations, stores, government buildings...
The devastation in Florida.
- That was Hurricane Andrew.
- That's what they told the public.
We wanted to embarrass the United States, and you made the police look like international heroes.
A first-class job costs five million.
If you want to step up to the price,
I got a target that'll make City Hall look like chicken feed.
That's a big target, but why should I think anything would be different?
Cos $5 million buys me.
I'm breaking out of here.
All right, but fail this time and my people won't be so forgiving.
Fail?
Show me one man who can stop me.
'Attention shoppers.
Be sure to check out our special on aisle 7.'
'That's aisle 7.'
Hey!
Give it to me!
My purse!
Somebody help me!
I want the purse, lady.
Help me!
# He's a jolly good fellow #
# For he's a jolly good fellow #
# Which nobody can deny #
Hear!
Hear!
Well...
We shot a lot of people together.
It's been great.
But today I retire, so if I do any shooting now, it'll have to be within the confines of my own home.
Hopefully, an intruder and not an in-law, like at my bachelor party.
Well, Ed.
- I officially give you my gun.
- Aw...
- And...my badge.
- And, uh...
Jane and I would like to keep the handcuffs as a souvenir.
- Oh, gee...
- Cheer up, Ed.
This is not goodbye.
It's just I won't ever see you again.
Oh, Frank.
My purse!
Somebody help me!
Out of the way.
Lieutenant Drebin!
Frank!
- Didn't you see that?
- What?
Oh, yes.
Kitty litter.
Two bags for a dollar.
Great.
'Order.
The jury will disregard that statement.
Continue, Counsellor.'
Alimony had been set by the court.
Right, Mr Clayton?
Yes, but...
But not once have you paid alimony to my client, repeatedly defying a court order.
I lost her address.
She moved twice, I couldn't keep up.
Don't lie to me.
You're under oath.
Do you know the penalty for perjury?
I'll ask that again.
Objection!
Your Honour, I... ow, ow.
Jeez!
- Counsel is leading the witness.
- Sustained.
Sweetie, mommy said no pounding when she's in session.
Please read the prosecution's last statement.
"Don't lie to me.
You're under oath."
- There.
"Do you know the penalty for perjury?"
That's all I have, Your Honour.
You may continue, Ms Spencer-Drebin.
Er... prosecution rests.
Defence, Ms Davis-Jacob-Steiner-Laszlo?
No further questions, Your Honour.
Court will recess until after the morning feed.
We're gonna win this.
I can feel it.
Yes.
Of course.
I married the wrong man.
I never thought that was possible.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, nothing.
Louise, there's no such thing as the wrong man.
You just have to work at it.
Now, let's see.
Mr and Mrs Drebin, right?
Now, you two have been married... for six months?
Yes.
We really appreciate you seeing us, Doctor.
You were recommended by our last therapist.
Yes, I was sorry to hear about his suicide.
You know, I feel it's important to get off on the right foot and not get caught up in blame.
Now, which one of you is impotent?
- That would be him.
- Yes, of course.
- Why don't you ask who's frigid?
- That would be him, also.
- How do you know?
You're never home.
- He resents that I work.
He has no idea what a woman wants.
You're so insensitive.
- Is this the toilet seat thing?
- It's babies, Frank.
I want to have a baby.
Whenever we make love, you get a headache.
I'm not a piece of meat, Jane.
I'm trying.
I've got ointments, lotions, creams, books, things that vibrate.
- Frank!
- Maybe it's your fault.
Have you tried sexy lingerie?
Some lacy underwear, a black teddy?
I've worn them all.
They don't work.
Oh.
Why don't you want a child?
Didn't I try to adopt that 18-year-old Korean girl?
Jane, Frank, here's what I suggest.
Make tonight a special night.
Dinner, wine, romantic music.
Put on the 24-hour Johnny Mathis station.
Just be Jane and Frank, lovers.
We haven't had a night like that in... in a long time.
- Not together.
- Frank?
Jane...
Having a baby is a big responsibility.
It's like being in charge of sanitation at a Haitian jail.
I'm just frightened.
Frank, let's make tonight something special.
Oh, honey, it's just that I love you so much.
My little lover sparrow.
My... puppy-wuppy wover.
My little love biscuit.
My little shnooky-wookums.
My little lady cheesy puppy.
Mr and Mrs Drebin, please.
I'm diabetic.
I think you should go now.
'I never thought we'd end this way.'
'How did you think we'd end?
'
'I don't know.
'Some other way.'
'Oh, Jason.'
Ed!
Nordberg!
It's been a long time.
Hiya, Frank!
You look terrific!
Thank you.
The little woman got me a Thighmaster.
Where are my manners?
Come on in.
How charming!
Sit, sit.
Excuse the mess.
It's my ironing day.
I just frosted some cupcakes.
- Would you care for one?
- Oh, not just now.
Frank, we have a problem with a terrorist threat.
- Police Squad is certain...
- I'd love a cupcake.
- That coffee smells great.
- I grind my own beans.
Frank, the reason we're here is that we need your help.
It's great!
I hoped you'd like them.
Made them from scratch.
I'll just get off my feet.
We may have a lead on a suspect in the City Hall bombing attempt.
These were taken by a news photographer.
- This girl was the diversion.
- We had them enlarged.
- They look familiar.
- No, the pin, she's a nurse.
Can I keep this one?
We traced her to the Karlson Clinic on Myrtlewood.
- She's Tanya Peters.
- Tanya Peters?
- You know her?
- Don't you remember in the 1970s?
The big disco shoot-out.
Ed, what's happenin', my man?
Frank, we missed you last night at the fondue party.
I went to see the Village People.
They're a stone soul gas, man.
- I can dig it.
- What have we got here?
One dead disco dancer.
Bummer.
What a mindbender, huh?
We think it was a love triangle.
This is the suspect's girlfriend, Tanya Peters.
Cigarette?
Yes, I know.
Well... we'll need a statement from you down at the station.
Nordberg!
Coming, Lieutenant!
I do remember.
You were one of the first test cases for monoxodyl, weren't you?
- What?
- I'm glad I could help.
Now, I've got some lamb to put in the oven.
We need a favour.
It's not that big a roast, Nordberg.
No, not that, Frank.
We need you to go undercover at the clinic.
Whoa!
I've given up police work, Ed.
You're whistling up the wrong neck of the woods.
- We're in a bind, Frank.
- What about Hedges and O'Malley?
They're in Hawaii.
Together.
Well, I can't.
Jane and I have a special evening planned.
You'll be home in time to make dinner.
I'd have to make pork chops.
Frank, think of all the crime out there.
Nobody is safe.
You'd be protecting Jane.
You'd be protecting all the Janes of the world.
And you haven't shot anybody in months.
That's true.
Funny how you miss the little things.
Might be good to feel that cold, hard steel pressed against my thigh once again.
The thrill of the chase, to be a man.
'After folding the laundry, I went to the Karlson Clinic.
'It's always important to have a disguise.
'and this operation was no different.
'I had no idea if Tanya would recognise me, 'so I slipped on a fake pair of glasses 'and combed my hair differently.
'The plan was to get in, 'get information about Tanya's link with the bombing, 'and get out as quickly as possible.
'I figured faking an old football injury would do the trick.'
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see a doctor, please.
Sign in here, please.
- Do you have an appointment, Mr...?
- Er, Smith.
No, I don't.
Take a number.
Six.
- What?
- Is six taken?
Does it have to be between 1 and 10?
You'll be called.
Thank you.
Mr Smith?
We've had a cancellation.
We can take you now.
Good morning, Mr Smith.
This way.
I really appreciate your seeing me like this.
I'm sure it won't take too long.
When did you notice the problem?
Uh, in the back yard with my uncle.
in the back yard with your uncle?
Yes.
When he comes over to visit, we like to go in the back yard, throw it around for a while.
What did you and your uncle find out?
I can't keep up with him.
Mine hurt, especially on the long ones.
I can't seem to straighten it out.
it has no feeling.
It's kind of numb.
I may have yanked it too much.
- If you would.
- For what?
- A sperm count.
- In here?
It's not exactly the back yard, but it'll do.
Well.
Follow me, and we'll do the necessary paperwork.
Sign these at the bottom and leave them with the nurse.
- This way, please.
- What?
- Number 17.
- Oh, no.
- A problem?
- No, no.
- This is 17.
- Have we met before?
If you'll excuse me, I'm next.
Ooh!
Aah!
Agh!
Eurgh!
- Sir?
- Aah!
Mr Smith, how are we doing?
I've been busy.
- Do you want a videotape to help?
- Do you have "Dances With Wolves"?
"Rocketeer"? "Lady And The Tramp"?
An adult movie.
Hmm...
Ooh!
Aah!
Yeow!
The tape was very entertaining.
Follow me.
Do you have "Spartacus"?
'Maintenance.
Cleanup, room 7.
'Maintenance.
Cleanup, room 7.
Stat.'
- What are you doing?
- Just freshening up.
You should look your best even though you're by yourself.
Are you sure we've never met?
Oh, here's my cup.
Back to work.
- Mr Smith?
- Are you OK in there?
- I could use a little help.
'Dr Rosenblatt, foreplay in room 7, please.
'Dr Rosenblatt.'
Honey...
I've been waiting all day.
I'm wearing the nightgown you bought me for our honeymoon.
Tonight's going to be special.
I'm going to make love to you for hours and hours.
Wouldn't Mr Happy like that?
- Hours?
- Like our first time together.
Jane, why don't I soak in the tub for a couple of days?
Possibly a week.
You're so cute.
Let me go get the oysters and clams.
Here.
I'll shave your back like last time.
Jane, I really don't think we should.
I...
Frank!
What's this?
I... fell on a rake.
You're lying.
Now I know why Ed's been calling.
- You're back on a case, aren't you?
- No, I swear.
It's another woman!
in your wildest dreams!
It's bad enough not having a baby, but I warned you about Police Squad, you white Anglo male!
Jane!
Ah!
Jane!
it was nothing, Jane.
I was doing Ed a small favour!
Some retirement.
I'm leaving, Frank.
I never thought you'd go back on your word.
- Aren't you being hasty?
- I don't think so.
- That's my cab.
I'll be at Louise's.
Oh, Frank, how could you?
We need time apart to think about us.
I'm not going to think.
Why start now?
I love you.
Look, baby, I am what I am, and I do what I do.
A few guys make shoelaces, some lay sod, some make a living neutering animals.
- I'm a cop.
- Pretty speech, Frank.
But my mind is made up.
I'm leaving.
All right.
Then take this with you.
You know how my lips feel about things.
Goodbye, Frank.
'You're listening to K-SAD, all-depressing, all the time.
'Here's a dedication to Frank from Jane, 'who just called from a taxi.
"'Frank, you lying weasel-weenie.
"'First you shoot blanks, now you're letting all the heat out..."'
He said he'd never go back to police work.
Once a cop, always a cop.
- He's married to his work.
- You'll always come in second.
There was an article in Cosmo - "Why all men are pigs".
"Frank" is just another word for loser.
I never want to see him again.
I want to get as far away as possible.
We'll go to my friend's cabin by the smelting plant.
The fresh air will do you good.
Go easy.
That's your second bottle of Chanel.
You're witnessing the beginning of a new Jane Spencer-Drebin.
No more little miss perky, devoting her life to one man.
I'm out for the new me.
Let's burn rubber.
- Didn't forget anything, did you?
- I hope not.
Just calm down, ma'am.
How many bodies did you find in your pool?
Sir, killing a gang member's only an $18 fine.
Just mail it in.
Frank!
Glad you could make it!
- Welcome, buddy.
- Nordberg.
Did you find Tanya's address, Frank?
I wrote it on a hanky, and I can't remember what I did with it.
- I'm getting a bit rusty.
- It could happen to anybody.
I brought you some of Frank's never-fail fudge!
You go on about your business.
I'll stay out of your hair.
it'll be...
Frank, let me take that.
We've got a surprise for you.
It's in honor of your thirty years on the force.
Nordberg.
Oh, boy.
This is really great.
Thank you, guys.
We thought it might cheer you up.
We heard about you and Jane.
Jane, Jane.
That name will always remind me of her.
Frank, I feel really bad about all of this.
If there's anything you need.
Dr Kevorkian's home phone number?
Nordberg, put it together.
- Frank, you know we're here for you.
- Thanks, Ed.
- Well, look who's here.
- Hi, Frank.
Nice to see you.
- I've got that data on the bomb.
- What did you find out?
The explosive is a very fine powder.
- It tastes like...
- That's fertilizer.
Another case.
This is what I'm talking about.
We detected a high quantity of nitroglycerine.
- Can you tell us where it came from?
- I'd be glad to.
Billions of years ago, the Earth was a molten mass...
Ted, I'm talking about the powder.
We don't know about that.
Let me take that urine specimen.
We found a list of the bomber's plans at the scene.
On a hunch, we analyzed the paper.
- And you got something?
- Yes.
The paper's from Statesville Prison.
Are you sure?
We analyzed the wood fibres and found them to be from the rare Canary island pine, which grows only in Oregon.
Contacting paper mills in that area led us to a distribution centre in Tacoma.
Unfortunately, the trail ended there.
- How'd you trace it to the prison?
- Right here on the letterhead.
After comparing handwriting of every known bomber serving a stretch in Statesville, we came up with a suspect - Rocco Dillon.
He's masterminding the bombings from inside the prison.
There's only one way to find out where Rocco will strike next.
We have to send someone in there.
- I'll do it.
- I wouldn't feel right about that.
If Rocco thinks you're a cop, you might end up dead.
"You might end up dead" is my middle name.
What about Jane?
I don't know her middle name.
I need the action.
I'm going inside the big house.
Frank, Ed.
I think you might want to see this.
We're testing out a prototype for an anti-carjacking device.
We'll see how it works.
- NO!
- Get out!
Don't make me...
Argh!
We call it the Denver jockstrap.
'After being retired for six months, I was finally back in action.
'Faster than saying "spread 'em", I was in Statesville Prison.
'I was surrounded by pimps, rapists and murderers.
'It was like being in the stands at an LA Raiders game.
'It was going to take all my police experience just to stay alive here.'
'After a long and generous cavity search,
'I reached my destination, Maximum Security - 'home of some of the most violent sociopaths in the country.
'And the worst of them all, Rocco Dillon.'
All right, in here.
Ain't no prison yet could hold me.
Attica!
Attica!
Power to the brothers!
Kill whitey!
Kill whitey!
Knock it off!
You're chirping loud for a new canary.
Keep flashing the big eyes, and I'll rotate your jaw.
Hey!
You know who you talking to?
The man is Rocco Dillon.
- Where's your prison number?
- It's unlisted.
Just call me Nick "The Slasher" McGirk.
Look, I'm the muscle in this pen.
Just stay out of my way.
You just watch your step, McGirk.
Take it from me, this place changes a man.
Yeah?
How?
I used to be white.
I was the drummer for the Osmonds.
Screw with me, he'll make you feel pain like never before.
I know.
I remember the Osmonds.
- Better hit the rack, McGirk.
- In a minute.
First I'm gonna make a list of who I'm gonna kill in the next few days.
Lights out.
Lockdown in two minutes.
'My dearest snooky wookums dumpling buns,
'I miss you so much.
'I haven't hurt this bad since the last time I was dumped.
'I remember it well.
Her name was Gabriella.
'We were supposed to be married, 'but on the day of our wedding, she never showed up.
'I was heartbroken.
I figured she had fallen for another man, 'someone who could do to her what I never could.
'I thought my life was over until that one glorious day.
'That was the day you became my wife.
'Our friends gathered to celebrate our love.
'It seems like only yesterday.
'We were all so overjoyed.
'I remember wishing we could take everyone with us.
'That was the happiest day of my life.
'I remember the plans we made.
Things were going to be so perfect.
'We got that housekeeper you always wanted.'
Hi, Mr D. Hi, Mrs D.
'And I knew that eventually our dream would come true.
'One day we'd have our own Frank Drebin Jr.'
Shut up.
I'm trying to get some sleep.
'Nah, it's no use.
She'll never come back.'
Bend over and pick it up for me, would you, lover?
No problem.
'Rocco could tell from my escapade in the shower 'that I was well-endowed with courage.
'Now I had to get on the inside.
'Like a blind man at an orgy, I was going to have to feel things out.'
Tyrone, I got the escape plans right here.
Just you and me.
- Burnett wants in.
- Burnett's one of the guards!
I know, but he's unhappy here.
All right, all right.
Whatever.
Got it all worked out right here.
What's this?
Another letter from your mommy?
- That's private!
- Let's see what we have.
- Give the man back his letter.
- Buzz off, butter cheeks.
What's so special about a little letter?
Wait a minute...
An escape plan!
This is your ticket to another twenty years, Dillon.
If the warden gets one look at this...
Hey!
You call this slop?
Real slop has got chunks in it!
This is more like gruel!
And this Chateau le Blanc '68 is supposed to be served slightly chilled!
This is room temperature!
What do you think we are, animals?
No!
What are we?
Homo sapiens?
You're right!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
Left hand blue.
Whose hand is that?
Come on, son.
You can do it.
Eat some beans!
You saved my bacon, McGirk.
I'd be in solitary if you hadn't done that.
I've been watching you.
You handle yourself good.
- "Really well".
- Whatever.
I got something big on the outside.
I could use you in my gang.
- Dental plan?
- Full coverage.
- What's the caper?
- First we bust out.
Thanks to you, we still have our escape plan.
Let's have it.
- It's a good plan.
- I've had better.
Listen, I've got a foolproof plan.
They got Tyrone.
Can't...
Can't we all just get along?
'Now that Tyrone was in solitary, it was just me and Rocco.
'He had to trust me...
'Shh!
Hold on.
'OK.
'I convinced Rocco to dig a tunnel.
'It was that or go out in a laundry truck.
'The thought of lying nose down in skidmarks 'didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.
'Disposing of the dirt was a problem I solved 'early in the construction.
'Apart from some chafing, we made good progress.
'We kept digging.
'Dummies gave the impression we were still in our cell.'
Lights out.
'There was more dirt than I thought.
Disposing of it was becoming tricky.'
Safe!
Where are you going?
- Are you thinking of Frank again?
- They're playing our song.
I understand.
Take your time.
- Hello there.
- Excuse me.
I'm hauling a load of rice cakes to Big D. Coming with me?
No.
- How about a kiss?
- No.
When a woman says no, she means yes.
- How about that kiss?
- Yes.
No?
I know your type.
Come on, baby.
We're two of a kind.
Oh, my God!
You killed him!
it was an accident.
Call the police.
Come to your senses.
You killed a man.
You're a hero to every woman.
We have to call Frank.
He'll protect us.
Frank is a man.
He'll see you locked away forever.
Jane, I want to join you, to help you kill as many men as possible.
Yipes!
Louise, do what you have to do.
I'm calling Frank.
Oh, boy, did that hurt.
Be home, Frank.
Answer the phone.
- Frank!
'Hi, this is Frank and Jane.
'We're the Drebins.
We're not home right now so leave a message!
'Which button is it?
' 'Not that one!
'
Tanya?
It WAS another woman.
Frank wasn't lying.
Honeymoon Bay Road.
I bet they're alone there now!
Frank!
Cell inspection.
There's been a rumour of a possible breakout.
If we suspect anyone of attempting to escape, they will be punished severely.
'Once word of the escape was out, we headed for the tunnel.
'The last few feet were dug on the run.
'Another forty-seven yards would take us beyond the prison walls.'
May he rest in peace, in the arms of our...
Jesus Christ!
Amen.
'Rocco had arranged for a car to meet us.
'After making a slight adjustment 'we arrived at the rendezvous point - a Los Angeles city high school.
Hey, that was close.
Hey, Rocco, who's the old hag?
She take one in the face?
She's my mother.
Mrs Dillon.
Your son is a ruthless, sadistic, cold-blooded animal.
- You must be proud of him.
- I am.
I want you to meet a real square egg,
Nick "The Slasher" McGirk.
There's fresh clothes in the back.
'Rocco's mom was quiet.
I felt she didn't care for me coming along.
'Like a midget at a urinal,
'I was going to have to stay on my toes.'
Hey!
Stop!
Oh, Frank.
it wasn't my fault.
That cow shouldn't have been in the road.
Hurry up.
You're letting the flies in.
- What do you think?
- Great setup.
No phone, miles from the nearest town, Playboy channel - perfect.
Nice digs.
But I'm here for the action.
What is it?
Bank, armored car, payroll?
You're getting a little bit too nosy, McGirk.
Relax, Ma.
- She's itching to use her new gun.
- I know the feeling.
'It was Tanya.
That bathing suit was never happier.
'I had only a second to admire the view.
I had to watch out.
'If she made me as a cop, I'd be tonight's meat loaf.'
Come here, sexy.
You're all woman.
I could tell by looking at you.
Hey, she's referring to me.
I was talking about your mother.
That's no way to be walking around.
Get some clothes on.
And what are you doing in my bathing suit?
Hey, who's the stud?
Meet the newest member of our gang.
Slasher McGirk, meet Tanya Peters.
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
I smelled cop on him the minute I saw him.
I get it all the time.
It's the underwear ads.
- Are you saying you're not a cop?
- Well, yeah.
- That's good enough for me.
- Me, too.
All right.
I'm glad that's all cleared up.
Ma, why not kiss and make up?
Well, all right.
Now that's more like it.
Uh!
Ow.
'I had to get a message to Police Squad.
'This was more than I could handle.
'No phone, miles from civilization, 'my prospects look bleaker than a gerbil's in a bat house.'
Who's down there?
Slasher...
Have you seen my pigeon?
- Pigeon?
What pigeon?
- What are you doing?
I'm... just contemplating my next move.
Your bishop is exposed.
It's these pants.
I usually wear a fuller cut.
You're all man.
I like that in my men.
You're coming on to me big-time, sister, but we got a problem.
- You're Jewish?
- No.
You're Rocco's girl.
in my book, that chapter's called, "Look, but don't touch."
I could have two lovers.
Kinky.
But I like my sex the way I play basketball - one-on-one and with as little dribbling as possible.
Oh, you're tense, Slasher.
Well, I could relax more if I knew about tomorrow.
You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
All I know is it's downtown and... big.
That's the way I like it.
- What else?
- Just this.
What are you doing?
Thank you for the advice.
I'll try that recipe, Miss Peters.
- How could you?
- Shove your tongue down his throat.
Oh!
Quiet.
You don't know me here.
That's a goodbye kiss, sister.
What's all this?
Who's the skirt?
Just some dizzy dame.
Probably broke down.
I'll take her to the bus depot.
Hey, she's married.
What if her husband comes looking?
- He must be a great guy.
- He breaks promises.
Look at you, traipsing all over, just to spite him.
- He left me.
- You left him.
- You should talk.
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you!
- Listen to you!
Jeez, you two, knock it off!
- You'd think you're married!
- What'll we do with her?
One thing's for sure.
There's no room for her here.
- I say we bump her off.
- Let's plug her here.
I've been on a job where I'd have given my eye teeth for a hostage.
We know women make the best hostages.
They're small, easy to move, eat less, smell nice.
Yeah, we got us an insurance policy.
Good thinking, kid.
Now, let's get some shuteye.
We got a big day ahead of us.
All right, it's rigged.
Watch the tower, Slasher.
This is what'll happen tonight.
Hey, aren't we far away?
Oh!
All right, pay attention.
On that tower's a device that's gonna net us five million bucks.
We're gonna detonate it this evening at an event that the whole world will be watching.
- Your crowning achievement.
- It's for both of us, Ma.
All set!
Set!
Very impressive.
Heh-heh-heh-heh.
Cool.
Heh-heh-heh-heh.
Cool.
America will be brought to its knees by this terrorist act.
This will be more embarrassing to the US than Tonya Harding.
We're almost there.
I don't wanna miss this.
Regards to Mrs Khadafi.
Tell her thanks for the cookies.
'It's a beautiful night in Los Angeles, 'and the stars are shining bright for the 66th Academy Awards.
'Fans are clamouring to see their favorite celebrities.
'It's Weird Al Yankovic and Vanna White.'
Put the dame in the trunk.
I'll meet you and Ma round back in ten minutes.
Got the passes?
If we pull this off, it's five million big ones.
Not bad!
- What's going to happen to me?
- I have an idea.
Right, Slasher.
You know what to do.
Check the tyres and fluid levels.
No, you muffin head, the dame.
We hit trouble, she's a bullet shield.
'Ladies and gentlemen, to present the lifetime achievement award...'
Roll tape.

OK, there's the man from Bryce Porterhouse.
He guards the envelopes until they're handed out.
He won't budge.
You know what to do.
Distract him so I can plant the bomb.

That ought to do it.
You'll never get away with this.
Rocco will kill you, whoever you are.

- Isn't that a unusual?
- It's happened before.
- Here's the plan.
- You'll never stop Rocco.
- Your chances are one in a million.
- Better than any state lottery.
I'm the good guy.
I can't let the bad guys win.
Our children can't be raised in fear.
They're going to blow that place sky high.
it'll be a tragedy.
Unless it's in a dance number.
Come on.
Does that radio work?
Call Police Squad.
Tell them Frank Drebin...
Forget it.
I wonder what the devil he wanted?
- Hold on.
- Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Yeah, and I'm Robert de Niro.
- Mr de Niro, we must get inside.
You and 10,000 other people.
Move along.
- Movie stars only.
- Come on.
I've got a better idea.
Cue talent.

Florence Henderson is going to win!
- No!
The bomb's in the envelope.
- You're right!
And the winner is...
Argh!
..Mary Lou Retton for "Fatal Affair".
Yes!
Yes!
Sorry.
We were rooting for Florence Henderson.
We must get those envelopes before they open any more.

Thank you.

Easy, now.
Talk to me.
What happened, Ma?
Slasher is Frank Drebin of Police Squad.

- He might find the bomb.
- Not if I find him first.
'Back from commercial in five seconds.'
Hurry with the mic and cue Donahue.
Read the card, moron.
"Well, Raquel, this certainly is a special evening.
Phew!
"I can barely catch my breath.
Turn it over to Raquel.

I read that.

Nordberg, look!
That's Frank at the Academy Awards.
- How'd he get tickets?
- Nordberg!
That's where Rocco is going to strike next.
He's planning to blow up the Academy Awards.
- We've got to go.
- We're not invited.
We're cops.
It's for you.
Nordberg, Police Squad.
Hello?
Hello?
Henderson, see about this phone.
I think it's broke.
'And now, today's lucky lotto numbers.
'Get your tickets ready, '12, 22, 18, and 9.'
Ahh!
And for his tale of genetics gone haywire in a retirement community,
Steven Spielberg, "Geriatric Park".
The winner is...
Raquel, just a second.
I just had a thought.
Christ!
This show is being seen all over the world.
If we could send good thoughts, transmit them through these cameras, to the leader of China...
Wing Wa Woo Tong... so that they might finally... be nice.
Thank you.
And the winner is...
Raquel, so many go to bed hungry in this nation.
Yet, cat food's full of tuna.
I can't help thinking each time I go to the zoo and see those porpoises crammed into tiny tanks, what a waste that is.
Butcher half of them now.
Hundreds of pounds of dolphin meat that could be fed to cats, freeing up that tuna for our nation's hungry.
- And the winner is...
- So many are... cold, shivering in the night.
I say take those cats and skin them.
Use their fur to keep hundreds warm.
Jesus, Phil!
And the winner is...
Give me that!
Ohh!
- Not one move.
- That barrel's cold.
It's room temperature.
It's OK.
It's not the bomb.
Jane?
Jane?
Jane?
- Silver hair.
- About 6'2".
Looked like Phil Donahue.
- That's the guy!
- Get him!
'Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome 'internationally renowned singing star, Pia Wadora.'
# You're walkin' along the street #
# Or you're at a party... #
There he is!
Stop him.
Excuse me.
Isn't that snot on your shoe?
I'll stay here.
You check the wings.
# ..that this could be the start of somethin' big... #
Oh, no!
Not him again?
Please, God.
# Who knows what's written in that magic book?
#
# But when a lover you discover #
# At the gate, my friend #
# Invite him in without a second look #
# You're watchin' the sun come up #
# Or counting' your... #
Grab him!
I'm Ed Hocken.
This is Officer Nordberg.
- We're here to prevent a disaster.
- You're too late.
# You're watchin' the sun... #
Frank!
# Or counting' your money #
# Or else in a dim cafe #
# You're ordering' wine #
# Then suddenly there he is #
# You want to be where he is... #
Come on, Nordberg.
We've got to get Frank.
# ..the start of somethin' #
# This could be the heart of somethin' #
# This could be the start of somethin' #
# Big #
Ohh!
Jane!
Jane!
I knew I'd bump into you.
I want answers, cherry cakes.
- I love you.
- Wrong answer.
I dropped out of the sap of the month club.
Listen, you've got one last chance.
And I don't mean a major league baseball, Steve Howe last chance.
- Where is Jane?
- I don't know.
- Where's the bomb?
- In the Best Picture envelope.
Oh, Mr Drebin, I want to go straight.
I'm tired of the lies.
Oh, kiss me.
Please kiss me.
I've never kissed lips so innocent,
So pure.
He looked like Phil Donahue, white hair...
- That's the guy!
- I'll get him.
'Ladies and gentlemen, to present the best picture award, 'two distinguished actors, Olympia Dukakis and James Earl Jones.'
Lord, what's that?
Looks like Phil Donahue throwing up in a tuba.
I don't think we should have Phil Donahue back next year.
Thank you.
Good evening.
It's a privilege for us to present the final award...
We've been worried about you.
Where's Rocco?
Where's Tanya?
- Sit down.
Take it easy.
- Thank God you're all right.
"indecent instincts" and "Sawdust And Mildew".
Every one of these movies was a box office hit, except for one.
- What's that?
- The best picture award.
My money's on "Sawdust And Mildew".
Olympia, would you do the honors?
Oh, my God!
That's the one!
The award for this year's best picture goes to...
Wait!
Oh!
Sorry about this.
Loved you in "Cone heads".
You, too.
Let me open this.
It's the bomb!
Freeze and nobody gets hurt!
Well... from now on.
Back in your seats, you little weasels!
This program's been interrupted.
Don't panic.
Stay with it.
Camera 2, move in on the old lady.
Better move back.
- Don't move!
- Now, pay attention!
I don't want to kill nobody unless I have to.
Drop your guns and kick 'em over here.
That bomb belongs to me.
Hand it over, Drebin.
You want to kill him, Ma?
Blink and I start shooting.
Give me that gun!
- Oh, my God!
- I'm not falling for that, sister.
I'm not well!
Get this stupid thing off me!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Ohh!
- Ma!
- She's a goner, Rocco.
Dead.
Then that's it.
I'm coming with you, Ma!
Pull out the bomb or I'll shoot the dame.
All right.
I'll do what you say.
- Frank!
- Don't harm her.
You pull out the bomb and you'll kill me anyway.
- Yeah.
No dice!
- Then I'll plug her.
- Shoot her, I'll empty the envelope.
- Frank, think about it.
It's all right.
You'll be dead.
Then you'll kill everyone here.
Yeah.
I'll shoot if you don't do as I say.
Jane?
I'd be safe, so would everyone else.
- But you'd be dead.
- This is complicated, Rocco.
Logically, you're psychotic, so you have the envelope, I'll have the gun.
- Frank?
!
- I know what I'm doing.
All right!
Here's your best picture!
In front of the world, this place is going up.
Well, if I'm going out, I'm going out happy.
Before we're all blown to bits, can I get my underwear out of my crack?
- I got to go comfortable.
- OK, but that's it.
- Give it up, Rocco.
You're history.
- Look, George Hamilton!
Come and get me, Drebin!
Throw me a gun!
Get rid of the bomb!
Hold on, sweetheart.
Frank, help!
- Frank.
- I know what I'm doing.
I hate heights!
Ohh!
Oh, no!
Move it, sister!
Screw the commercials!
All right, copper, you killed my ma!
I'm taking the dame away from you.
You hear me, copper?
One push and Mrs Drebin is linoleum.
Get a camera up there.
This could be my best work.
Any last words before I throw you off?
- Yes.
Don't do it.
- Anything else?
Frank, I love you.
I want the world to know you're the perfect man.
Frank, I hope you can hear me.
They said I couldn't do drama.
I was wrong.
Taking you away from Police Squad was a mistake.
I know now that's why you couldn't perform decent sex.
I realize that now, and other things.
Everything's under control.
Nobody move!
Any vibration may set this thing off.
Frank, I've learned my lesson.
And though it may be too late for me,
I want all you ladies to remember something.
Don't ever take your men for granted, because good men don't just fall out of the sky.
Aah!
He's caught up in the cable!
Do something!
I'm coming, Ma!
Rocco?
Papshmir?
Jane...
- I never want us to be apart again.
- Oh, Frank!
You like me.
You really like me!
- Frank, slow down!
- Hurry up!
Relax.
There's time.
- You got the camcorder?
- Here.
Which room?
Delivery room.
This must be it.
Jane, I'm here.
Frank is here.
Push!
Here it comes now.
Breathe, honey.
Breathe, Jane.
One more push.
That's it.
Congratulations, Dad.
It's a boy!
Nordberg!
You come back here!
- Frank, it's a boy.
- I know!
Hey, look!
It's the President!
And the Pope!
Oh, my God!
Look!
It's disgruntled postal workers.
Wait a minute!
Give me my baby back!
- Are you all right?
- I'm soaking wet.
- I'll get the talcum powder.
- It's not that.
I had a nightmare.
Crime all around me, I couldn't stop it.
- Frank, it was just a dream.
- You're right.
All I need is a good night's rest.
Tomorrow everything will be fine.
How's my little boy?
Getting along OK, sweetie?
As well as a heterosexual can in prison.
I don't know if I can take it any longer.
- How's Tanya?
- Tanya's the same.
Milky, creamy skin, pouting red lips, firm buttocks, ample breasts, ears you'd love to stick your tongue into...
- I'll get guy cramps if you keep this up.
- Sorry.
There's somebody here to see you.
Pahpshmir!
- My people are very upset.
- Of course, they're Arab terrorists.
You're supposed to be the world's best terrorist bomber.
- Train stations, government buildings.
- The devastation in South Florida.
- That was Hurricane Andrew.
- That's what they told the public.
We wanted to embarrass the USA.
You've made the police look like heroes.
I told you.
A first-class job would cost five million.
If you want to step up the price,
I got a target that'll make City Hall look like chicken feed.
A big target.
Why should anything be different?
Because five million dollars buys me!
I'm breaking out of here.
If you fail this time, Mr. Dillon, my people won't be so forgiving.
Fail?
Show me one man who can stop me.
Attention shoppers, be sure to check out our special on paper towels.
That's aisle seven.
Hey!
- Give it to me!
- My purse!
Somebody help me!
- Let go of the purse, lady!
- Help me!
For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow which nobody can deny.
Well, we shot a lot of people together.
It's been great.
Today I retire.
If I do any shooting now, it'll have to be in my own home.
Hopefully, it'll be an intruder and not an in-law like at my bachelor party.
Ed, I officially give you my gun and my badge.
And...
Jane and I would like to keep the handcuffs as a souvenir.
Cheer up, Ed.
This is not goodbye.
This is just "I won't ever see you again".
- Somebody help me!
- Out of my way!
- It.
Drebin!
Frank!
Didn't you see that?
- What?
Oh...
Yes, kitty litter.
Two bags for a dollar.
Great!
Order.
The jury will disregard that last statement.
Continue, counselor.
- The alimony had been set by the court.
- Yes, but...
You haven't paid alimony in two years, repeatedly defying a court order.
- Isn't that right, Mr. Clayton?
- I'd lost her address.
She moved twice.
Don't lie to me.
You're under oath.
Do you know what the penalty for perjury is?
- I'll ask you that again.
- Objection!
Your Honor, I...
Ow, ow, gee.
- Counsel is leading the witness.
- Sustained!
Mommy said no pounding when she's in session.
Read the prosecution's last statement.
"Don't lie to me, Mr. Clayton.
You're under oath." Good boy.
"Do you know what the penalty for perjury is?"
That's all I have, Your Honor.
You may continue, Ms Spencer-Drebin.
Prosecution rests.
Defense Attorney Ms Davies-Jacobs-Steiner-Lazlo.
No further questions.
Court will recess until after the morning feeding.
- We can win this.
I can feel it.
- Yes, of course.
- I married the wrong man.
- I never thought that was possible.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, nothing.
Louise, there's no such thing as the wrong man.
You just have to work at it.
Now, let's see.
Mr. and Mrs. Drebin, right?
Now, you two have been married for six months?
Yes.
We really appreciate you seeing us, Doctor.
Our last therapist recommended you.
Yes, I was sorry to hear about his suicide.
A couple need to get off on the right foot and not get caught up in blame.
- Now, which one of you is impotent?
- That would be him.
Yes, of course.
- Why don't you ask who's frigid?
- That would be him.
- How would you know?
- He resents that I'm a working woman.
He has no idea what a woman wants or needs.
- You're so insensitive.
- Is this that toilet seat thing?
I want to have a baby.
Every time we make love, you have a headache.
I'm not a piece of meat.
I'm trying!
I've got ointments, lotions, creams, books, things that vibrate...
- Frank!
- Maybe it's your fault.
Have you tried sexy lingerie?
Lacy underwear?
A black teddy?
- I've tried them all.
They don't work.
- Oh!
Why don't you want a child?
Didn't I try to adopt that 18-year old Korean girl?
Jane, Frank, here's what I suggest.
Make tonight a special night.
Dinner, wine, romantic music.
Put on the 24-hour Johnny Mathis station.
Just be Jane and Frank.
Lovers!
We haven't had a night like that in a long time.
- Not together.
- Frank!
Jane, having a baby is a big responsibility.
Like being in charge of sanitation at a Haitian jail.
I'm just frightened.
Let's make tonight something special.
Oh, honey, it's just that I love you so much.
My little lover sparrow.
My puppy wuppy wuvver.
My little love biscuit.
- My little snookie wookums.
- My little lady cheesy puffy.
Mr. and Mrs. Drebin, please, I'm a diabetic.
I think you ought to go now.
- I never thought we'd end this way.
- How did you think we'd end?
I don't know.
Some other way.
Oh, Jason, please...
Bobbi...
- I've been hurt before.
- We have to fight this thing together.
Ed, Nordberg!
It's been a long time!
- Good to see you, buddy.
- You look terrific.
I'm taking a step class, and I got a thigh master for Christmas.
Where are my manners?
Come on in!
- How charming!
- Sit, sit.
Excuse the mess.
It's my ironing day.
I've just frosted some cupcakes.
- Would you care for one?
- Not now.
We're having trouble with a terrorist threat.
- Police Squad is certain that...
- I'd love a cupcake.
- That coffee smells great.
- I grind my own beans.
We're here because we need your help with something.
- They're great!
- I'd hoped you'd like them.
Made from scratch.
I'll just get off my feet.
We may have a lead on a suspect in the City Hall bombing attempt.
These were taken by a photographer.
- She was used as a diversion.
- We've had them enlarged.
- They look familiar.
- No, Frank, the pin.
She's a nurse.
Can I keep this one?
We traced her to the Karlson Clinic on Myrtlewood.
Her name is Tanya Peters.
- Do you know her?
- Don't you remember back in the 70s?
The big disco shoot out.
Hey, Ed.
What's happening, my man?
We missed you last night at the fondue party.
Couldn't make it.
I saw the Village People.
They're gas.
- Far out, I can dig it!
- What's this?
One dead disco dancer.
- Bummer!
What a mind bender.
- We think it was a love triangle.
This is the suspect's girlfriend, Tanya Peters.
- Cigarette?
- Yes, I know.
We'll need a statement from you down at the station.
- Nordberg!
- Coming, lieutenant!
I do remember!
You were one of the first test cases for minoxidol.
- What?
- I'm glad I could be of help.
If you don't mind, I've got a rump of lamb to roast.
- We need a favor.
- It's not that big a rump roast.
It's not that.
We need you to go undercover at the clinic.
I've quit police work.
You're whistling up the wrong neck of the woods.
I wouldn't ask, but we're in a bind.
- What about Hedges and O'Malley?
- They're in Hawaii... together.
I can't.
Jane and I have a special evening planned.
It'll only take a few hours.
Still time to make dinner.
I don't know.
I'll have to make pork chops.
Think of all the crime.
Nobody is safe.
You'd be protecting Jane.
You'd be protecting all the Janes of the world.
- You haven't shot anybody in 6 months.
- That's true.
Funny how you miss the little things.
Might be good to feel cold steel against my thigh again.
The thrill of a chase... to be a man!
After folding the laundry, I set out for the clinic.
Police operations require a foolproof disguise.
This operation was no different.
I had no idea if Tanya would recognize me, so I wore fake glasses.
I combed my hair differently, just in case.
I planned to get in and find out about Tanya's connection with the bombing, and get out as quickly as possible.
I figured faking an old football injury would do the trick.
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see a doctor.
Sign in here, please.
Do you have an appointment, Mr.?
Smith.
No, I don't.
- Then take a number.
- Six.
- What?
- Is six taken?
Does it have to be between one and ten?
- You'll be called.
- Thank you.
Mr. Smith?
We've had a cancellation.
We can take you now.
Dr. Kohlzak?
Good morning, Mr. Smith.
Right this way.
I appreciate you seeing me.
I'm sure it won't take too long.
- When did you first notice the problem?
- In the back yard with my uncle.
- In the back yard?
With your uncle?
- Yes, when he visits we like to go out in the back yard and throw it around.
What did you and your uncle find out?
I can't keep up with him.
Mine hurt, especially on the long ones.
I can't seem to straighten it out.
It has no feeling.
It's kind of numb.
I may have yanked it too much, maybe.
- If you would...
- For what?
- A sperm count.
- In here?
It's not exactly the back yard, but it will do.
Well...
Follow me, and we'll do the necessary paperwork.
Sign these at the bottom, and leave them with the nurse.
- This way, please.
- What?
- Number 17.
- A problem?
- No.
- This is 17.
You're next.
- Have we met before?
- If you excuse me, I'm next.
Sir...
Mr. Smith, how are we doing?
I've been busy, if that's what you mean.
Would you like a video tape to assist you?
Do you have "Dances With Wolves"?
"Rocketeer"? "Lady And The Tramp"?
An adult movie.
The tape was very entertaining.
Follow me.
Do you have "Spartacus"?
Maintenance, clean up Room 7.
Maintenance, clean up Room 7.
Stat.
- What are you doing?
- Freshening up.
You should always look your best, even by yourself.
Are you sure we've never met?
Oh, here's my cup.
Back to work.
Mr. Smith, are you OK in there?
I could use a little help.
Dr. Rosenblatt, foreplay in Room 7, please.
Honey, I've been waiting all day.
I'm wearing the nightgown you bought me for our honeymoon.
Tonight's gonna be special.
I'll make love to you for hours and hours.
Wouldn't Mr. Happy like that?
- Hours?
- Like our first time together.
Why don't I get ready and soak in the tub for a couple of days?
Possibly a week.
So cute!
Let me go and get the oysters and clams.
Here.
I'll shave your back like last time.
Jane, I really don't think we should.
- Frank, what's this?
!
- I fell... on a rake.
You're lying.
Now I know why Ed's been calling.
- You've been back on the case.
- No, I swear.
It's another woman.
In your wildest dreams!
It's bad enough you won't have a baby.
I warned you against working again.
You white Anglo male!
Jane, it was nothing.
I was only doing Ed a small favor.
Some retirement!
I'm leaving.
I never thought you'd go back on your word.
- Aren't you being a little hasty?
- I don't think so.
That's the cab.
You can reach me at Louise's.
How could you?
We need some time apart to think about us.
I'm not going to think.
Why now?
I love you.
Look, I am what I am, and I do what I do.
Some make shoelaces, some make a living neutering animals.
- I am a cop.
- Pretty speech.
My mind is made up, I'm leaving!
All right, then take this with you.
I guess you know how my lips feel about things.
Goodbye, Frank.
Your listening to K.S.A.D. All depressing, all the time.
Here's a dedication to Frank from Jane calling from a taxi.
You not only shoot blanks, you leave the door open, letting the heat out.
Were you born in a barn?
He wouldn't do any more police work.
Once a cop, always a cop.
- He's married to his work, not me.
- You'll come second.
There's an article in Cosmo, "Why All Men Are Pigs".
Read it!
Frank's just another word for "loser".
I never want to see him again.
I want to get far away from here.
We'll go to my friend's cabin.
The fresh air will do you good.
Go easy!
That's your second bottle of Chanel.
This is the beginning of a new Jane Spencer-Drebin.
No more Miss Perky who devoted her life to one man.
I'm out for the new me.
Let's burn rubber!
- Have you forgotten anything?
- I hope not.
Calm down.
How many bodies did you find in your pool?
In this state killing a gang member is only an $18 fine.
- Frank!
Glad you could make it.
- Welcome, buddy.
- Nordberg, Ed.
- Did you find Tanya's address?
I wrote it down on a hanky, and I can't remember what I did with it.
- I'm getting rusty.
- That could happen to anybody.
I brought you some of "Frank's Never Fail Fudge".
- Go on about your business.
- Smells great.
- I'll stay out of your hair.
- It'll be just like...
Frank, let me get that.
We have a surprise for you.
In honor of your 30 years on the force.
Nordberg!
Oh, boy.
This is really great.
Thank you, guys.
It might cheer you up.
We heard about you and Jane.
Jane, Jane...
The name will always remind me of her.
I feel bad about this.
If there's anything you need?
- Like Dr. Kevorkian's home number.
- Nordberg, put it together!
- We're here for you.
- Thanks.
- Look who's here.
Nice to see you.
- Ted.
- I have data for you on the bomb.
- What did you find out?
- The explosive is a very fine powder.
- It tastes like...
That's fertilizer.
It's for another case.
This is what I'm talking about.
- We detected nitroglycerine.
- Can you tell us where it came from?
I'd be glad to.
Billions of years ago, the earth was a molten mass...
- I mean the powder.
- We have no clue.
Let me take that urine, Frank.
We found a list of the bomber's plans at the scene.
- We analyzed the paper.
- And?
The paper is from Statesville Prison.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
The wood is from the rare Canary Island Pine.
It only grows in Oregon.
Contacting paper mills led us to a distribution center in Tacoma.
There the trail ended.
- How did you trace it to Statesville?
- The letterhead.
We compared the handwriting of all bombers serving in Statesville and found a suspect, Rocco Dillon.
He's masterminding the bombings from the prison.
If so, there's only one way to find out where Rocco'll strike next.
- We'll have to send someone in prison.
- I'll do it.
I wouldn't feel right about that.
If Rocco finds out, you might end up dead.
"You might end up dead" is my middle name.
- What about Jane?
- I don't know hers.
I need the action.
I'm going inside the big house.
Frank, Ed, you might want to see this.
We're testing a prototype for a new anti-carjacking device.
You'll get to see how it works.
- Get out!
- No.
Don't make me use...
"The Denver Jockstrap".
After being retired for six months, I was back in action.
Faster than you say "Spread 'em!", I was inside Statesville Prison.
I was surrounded by pimps, rapists and murderers.
It was like being in the stands of an LA Raiders' game.
It was going to take all my police experience just to stay alive in here.
After a long and generous cavity search, I reached my destination:
Maximum security, home of some of the country's most violent sociopaths.
And the worst of them all, Rocco Dillon.
All right, in here.
Ain't no prison yet could hold me.
Attica!
Attica!
Power to the brothers.
Kill whitey, kill whitey!
Knock it off!
You're chirping loud for a new canary.
Keep flashing your eyes, and I'll balance your jaw.
Hey!
You know who you're talking to?
The man is Rocco Dillon.
- Where's your prison number?
- It's unlisted.
Just call me Nick "The Slasher" Magirk.
Look, ham head.
I'm the muscle in this pen.
Stay out of my way.
Just watch your step, Magirk.
Take it from me, this place changes a man.
- Oh, yeah, in what way?
- I used to be white.
I was the drummer for the Osmonds.
Screw with me, he'll make you feel pain you've never felt before.
I know, I remember the Osmonds.
- Better hit the rack, Magirk.
- In a minute.
First I'll make a list of the people I'm gonna kill in the next few days.
Lights out!
Lock down in two minutes!
My dearest snookie wookums buns,
I miss you so much.
I haven't felt this bad since... the last time I was dumped.
I remember it well.
Her name was Gabriella.
We were supposed to marry, but on our wedding day, she never showed up.
I was heartbroken, destroyed.
I figured she'd fallen for another man.
Someone who could do to her what I never could.
I thought my life was over until that one glorious day.
That was the day you became my wife.
All our friends celebrated our love.
It seemed like only yesterday.
We were all so overjoyed.
We wished they all could come with us.
That was the happiest day of my life.
I'll never forget the plans we made.
Things were going to be perfect.
We were going to get that housekeeper you always wanted.
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. D.
I knew that eventually our dream would come true.
One day we'd have our own Frank Drebin Jr.
Shut up, Magirk.
I'm trying to sleep.
It's no use.
She'll never come back.
Bend over and pick it up for me would you, lover?
No problem.
Rocco could tell from my escapade in the shower that I was courageous.
Now, I had to get on the inside.
Like a blind man at an orgy, I would have to feel things out.
Tyrone, I've got the escape plans here.
Just you and me.
- Burnett wants in, too.
- He's a guard!
- I know, but he's unhappy here.
- All right, whatever.
Got it all worked out right here.
What's this?
Another letter from your mommy?
- That's private, screw.
- Let's have a look.
- Give him back his letter.
- Buzz off, butter cheeks.
What's so special about a little letter?
Wait a minute... an escape plan!
This is your ticket to another 20 years.
If the Warden gets one look...
You call this slop?
Real slop has got chunks of things in it.
This is more like gruel!
This Chateau LeBlanc '68 is supposed to be served slightly chilled.
This is room temperature.
- What do you think we are?
Animals?
- No!
What are we?
Homo sapiens?
You're right!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
No, no.
Stop!
Right hand red, left hand blue.
Who's got a hand in my pocket?
Come on, son.
You can do it.
Eat some beans.
You saved my bacon.
I'd be in solitary if you hadn't done that.
You've been handling yourself really good.
- Really well.
- Whatever.
I've got something big coming up.
I could have use for you.
You've got a dental plan?
What's the caper?
We've got to bust out of this playpen.
Thanks to you, we have an escape plan.
- It's a good plan.
- I've had better.
Listen, I've got a foolproof plan.
They've got Tyrone.
Can't we all just get along?
Now that Tyrone was in solitary, it was just me and Rocco.
He had no choice but to trust me...
Shh!
Hold on!
Anyway, I convinced Rocco to dig a tunnel.
It was either that or the laundry truck.
The thought of lying nose down in underwear with skid marks didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.
Disposing of the dirt was a problem I solved early.
Outside of some major chaffing, we made good progress.
We kept digging, and dummies gave the impression we were in our cell.
Lights out, Magirk.
There was more dirt than I anticipated.
Disposing of it was tricky.
Safe!
Where are you going?
Are you thinking of Frank again?
- They are playing our song.
- I understand.
Take your time.
- Hello, there.
- Excuse me.
I'm hauling a load of rice cakes to Big D.
- Why don't you come?
- No.
- How about a kiss?
- No!
I know women mean "yes" when they say "no".
How about that kiss?
- Yes.
- What do you mean "no"?
Come on, baby, we're two of a kind.
- You killed him!
- It was an accident.
Call the police.
Come to your senses.
You killed a man.
You're a hero to all American women!
Call Frank.
He'll protect us.
He's a man.
He'll lock you away for life.
I wanna help you kill as many men as possible.
Do what you have to do.
I'm calling Frank.
Be home, Frank, please.
Answer the phone, snuggle pants.
Frank!
- Hi, this is Frank.
- And Jane.
We're the Drebins.
We're not home right now.
Leave a message.
- Which button do I press?
- Not that one.
Tanya?
It was another woman.
Frank was telling the truth.
Honeymoon Bay Road, I bet they're there right now.
Oh, Frank!
Cell inspection!
There's been a rumor of a possible break-out.
If we suspect anyone of attempting to escape, they will be punished severely.
Once word of the escape was out, we had to move for the tunnel.
The last few feet had to be dug on the run.
We were sure that another 47 yards would take us beyond the prison walls.
May he rest in peace in the arms of our loving...
Jesus Christ!
Amen.
Rocco had arranged for a getaway car to meet us.
After adjusting our direction, we arrived at the rendezvous point a Los Angeles city high school.
Hey, that was close.
Hey, Rocco, who's the old hag?
- She take one in the face?
- She's my mother!
Mrs. Dillon, your son is a ruthless, sadistic, cold-blooded animal.
- You must be very proud of him.
- I am.
Ma, I want you to meet a real square egg, Nick "The Slasher" Magirk.
There are fresh clothes in the back.
Rocco's mother was quiet.
I sensed she didn't like me coming along.
Like a midget at a urinal, I would have to stay on my toes.
Hey!
Stop!
Oh, Frank!
It wasn't my fault.
That cow shouldn't have been on the road.
Hurry up, you're letting the flies in!
- What do you think, kid?
- Sweet setup.
No phones.
Miles from the nearest town.
Playboy Channel.
Perfect.
Nice digs, but I'm here for the action.
Are we taking banks or armored cars?
- You're getting too nosy, Magirk.
- Relax, Ma.
- She's been itching to try this gun.
- I know the feeling.
It was Tanya.
That bathing suit was never happier.
I had only a second to admire the view.
I had to watch out.
If she made me as a cop, I'd be tonight's meat loaf.
- Come here, sexy.
- You're all woman.
I can tell.
Hey, she's referring to me.
I was talking about your mother.
That's no way to be walking around.
Get clothes on.
And what are you doing in my bathing suit?
- Hey, who's the stud?
- Meet our newest gang member.
Slasher Magirk, meet Tanya Peters.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
I smelt cop the minute I saw him.
I get that all the time.
The underwear ads.
Are you saying you're not a cop?
Well, yeah.
- That's good enough for me.
- I'm fine.
I'm glad that's all cleared up.
Ma, why don't you two kiss and make up?
Well, all right.
That's more like it.
I had to get a message to the squad.
This was more than I could handle by myself.
No phone and miles from people, I was worse off than a gerbil in a bath house.
Who's there?
Slasher, have you seen my pigeon?
Pigeon?
What pigeon?
- What are you doing?
- I'm just contemplating my next move.
Your bishop is exposed.
It's these pants.
I usually wear a fuller cut.
You're all man.
I like that in my men.
You're coming on to me big time, purring like a kitten with a mouse.
- But we got a problem.
- You're Jewish?
No.
You're Rocco's girl.
In my book that chapter is called "Look, But Don't Touch".
I could have two lovers.
Kinky.
But I like my sex the way I play basketball, one on one and with as little dribbling as possible.
You're tense, Slasher.
I could relax more, if I knew what was on tomorrow.
Do you know anything about that?
All I know is that it's downtown and... big.
That's the way I like it.
What else?
Just this...
- What are you doing?
- Thank you for the advice.
- I'll try that recipe out, Ms Peters.
- How could you?
You shove your tongue as far down as you can.
Quiet.
You're not supposed to know me here.
That's a goodbye kiss, sister.
- What's this?
Who's the skirt?
- Just some dizzy dame.
Her car broke down.
I'll take her to the bus.
Look, she's married.
What if her husband comes here?
- He will.
He must be great.
- He breaks promises.
And you traipse all over to spite a wonderful guy.
- He left me.
- You left him.
- You should talk!
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you!
- Listen to you!
You two, knock it off!
You'd think you were married.
- What do you want to do with her?
- One thing is for sure there's no room for her here.
- I say we bump her off.
- Let's plug her.
- No.
I was on a job that went hooey.
I'd have given my eyeteeth for a hostage.
Women make the best ones.
They are smaller, easy to take along, eat less, smell nice.
Yeah, we got us an insurance policy.
Good thinking, kid.
Come on, let's get some shut-eye.
We got a big day ahead of us.
It's rigged.
Keep your eye on the tower.
- It's what's going to happen tonight.
- Aren't we awfully far away?
On the top of that tower is a device that's going to net us five million bucks.
A thing I've been working on.
We'll detonate it this evening at an event the whole world will be watching.
- Your crowning achievement.
- It's for both of us, Ma.
- All set?
- Set.
Very impressive.
Cool.
Cool.
America will be brought to its knees by this terrorist act.
It'll be more embarrassing to the US than Tonya Harding.
We're there.
Give my regards to Mrs. Gaddafi.
And tell her thanks for the cookies.
It's another beautiful night in LA, and the stars are shining bright for the 66th annual Academy Awards.
Fans are clamoring to see their favorite celebrities.
Here are two, "Weird Al" Yankovic and Vanna White.
Slasher, put the dame in the trunk.
I'll meet you and Ma around the back in ten minutes.
Got the passes?
- We pull this up, it's 5 million big ones.
- Not bad, Ma.
- What's going to happen to me?
- I have an idea.
- Slasher, you know what to do.
- Right.
Check the spare tire and all fluid levels.
No, keep an eye on the dame.
We hit trouble, she's a bullet shield.
Ladies and gentlemen, to present the Academy's Lifetime Achievement...
Ready, 3.
Roll tape.
Go to clip.
Aspirin, please.
Go to 3.
Ready, 4.
This year's Lifetime Achievement Award winner's credits include great films.
"Sandals and Loincloth", 1958.
"Sweaty Boatmen", 1959.
"The Leather Clad Centurion", 1960, and his first color feature in 1966, "Big Shiny Spears".
There's the man from Bryce/Porterhouse.
He guards the envelopes until they're handed out.
He won't budge from there.
Distract him so I can plant the bomb in an envelope.
Accepting the award for Mr. Bronkowitz is Margaret Red Feather.
That ought to do it.
You'll pay for this.
Rocco'll kill you whoever you are.
- Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Isn't that a little unusual?
- It happened to me.
Here's the plan.
- You'll never stop Rocco.
- Your chances are one in a million.
- Better than any state lottery.
I'm the good guy.
I can't let the bad guys win.
Our children can't be raised in fear.
If we can't stop them, they'll blow that place up.
It'll be a tragedy, unless it happens during a dance number.
Come on.
Does that radio work?
Call Police Squad.
Tell them Frank Drebin...
Forget it.
I wonder what the devil he wanted?
- Hold on.
- Sergeant Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Yeah, and I'm Robert De Niro.
- Mr. De Niro, we've got to get inside.
You and 10,000 other people.
Move along.
Movie stars only.
Come on.
I've got a better idea.
And cue talent.
To present the award for Best Supporting Actress Mariel Hemingway and Elliot Gould.
Thank you.
The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are:
Mary Lou Retton, "Fatal Affair", one woman's ordeal to overcome the death of her cat, set against the background of the Hindenburg disaster.

Sorry, but this is official police business.
Shannen Doherty, "Basic Analysis", one woman's triumph over a yeast infection, set against the background of the tragic Buffalo Bill season of 1991.
Thank you, sheriff.
Still no word of Frank or Rocco's gang.
I'm worried.
He should've phoned in.
Let me check your tickets.
Lovely gown.
Is that Cool Whip?
All right, Tim and Erica Brown.
OK, enjoy the show.
Let's see.
Vanna White and "Weird Al" Yankovic.
OK!
Ready, 3... and 3.
And Florence Henderson, "Analysis of a Proposal"...
- Rocco could be anywhere.
- He's had time to plant the bomb.
- And the winner is...
- This is going to be dynamite.
- Jane.
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yes.
Florence Henderson'll win.
It's about time.
- No, the bomb is in an envelope.
- You're right!
And the winner is Mary Lou Retton for "Fatal Affair".
I'm sorry, we were rooting for Florence Henderson.
We've got to get to the envelopes.
- So many.
- They added 75 categories.
"Best Actor in a Columbus movie"?
Best Director is presented by star of stage and screen Raquel Welch and host of his own award-winning talk show Phil Donahue.
That might be the envelope for the bomb.
Keep looking here.
One more second, Mr. Donahue.
Oh, my God!
Look at Donahue.
Stop the stairs, Joey.
Joey!
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to present the...
What the hell?
!
- Jesus!
- Go to commercial.
Easy now.
Talk to me.
What happened, Ma?
Slasher is Frank Drebin of Police Squad.
Lousy, two-bit copper!
I treated him like my brother... the one I didn't kill.
- He might find the bomb.
- Not if I find him first.
- Back from commercial in 5 seconds.
- Hurry up with the mike.
Cue Donahue.
Read it.
Read the card, moron.
"Well, Raquel, this certainly is a special evening.
Phew!"
"I can barely catch my breath.
Turn it over to Raquel."
"Raquel:
I'm used to being out of breath, working out to my..."
What's he doing?
!
"Hold for laughter.
To Phil.
Gets me out of breath just watching you."
- "To Raquel.
Oh, Phil..."
- I'm supposed to read that.
"Let's get to the subject at hand.
Pick up the envelope..."
The nominees for best director are:
Sir Richard Attenborough for his musical based on the life of Mother Teresa, "Mother".
Food, I love food and I'm really in the mood for a big corn dog of pooh-pooh platter two ding-dongs, it doesn't matter and some tuna helper, I'll be racing back for more
But don't get any sausage 'cause I'll blow chunks on the floor
Spike Lee, "X II
- The Merchandising"
Nordberg, look.
That's Frank at the Academy Awards.
How did he get tickets?
That's where Rocco Dillon is going to strike next, the Academy Awards.
- We have to get there.
- We're not invited.
We're cops.
- It's for you.
- Nordberg, Police Squad.
Hello.
Hello.
Henderson, see about this phone.
I think it's broke.
And now, here are today's lucky lotto numbers.
Get your tickets ready because here they come: 12, 22, 18 and 9.
And for his tale of genetics gone haywire in a retirement community,
Steven Spielberg, "Geriatric Park".
And the winner is...
- Raquel, just a second.
- Now what?
- I just had a thought.
- Oh, Christ.
This show is being seen all over the world, I was thinking if we could all send good thoughts through these cameras to men like the leader of China, Wing Wa Woo Tong, so that they might finally be nice.
Thank you.
And the winner is...
Raquel, so many go to bed hungry in this nation, yet cat food is full of tuna.
Each time I go to the zoo and see those porpoises crammed into tiny tanks,
I think, "What a waste that is."
Butcher half of them now!
That's a lot of dolphin meat that can be fed to our cats, freeing up that tuna for our nation's hungry.
- And the winner is...
- So many are cold, shivering in the night.
So I say, "Take those cats, skin them."
- "Use their fur to keep hundreds warm."
- Jesus, Phil.
And the winner is...
- You!
- Give me that!
- Not one move.
- That barrel's cold.
It's OK.
It's not the bomb.
- Jane.
Jane!
- Big trouble!
Jane.
Silver hair.
Kind of looked like Phil Donahue.
That's the guy!
Please welcome internationally renowned actress and singing star
Pia Zadora.
- Excuse me, is that snot on your shoe?
- Snot?
Where?
Oh, no.
Not him again.
Please, God.
Get off the stage!
Ed Hocken and Nordberg from Police Squad.
- We're here to prevent a disaster.
- Too late for that.
It's Frank.
Come on, Nordberg.
We've got to get to Frank.
Jane!
Jane!
I knew I'd bump into you somewhere.
I want answers, cherry cakes.
- I love you.
- Wrong answer.
I quit the Sap-of-the-Month Club long ago.
Angel drawers, you've got one last chance.
Not one of those Major-League- Baseball-Steve-Howe last chances.
- Where is Jane?
- I swear I don't know.
- Where is the bomb?
- In the Best Picture envelope.
Oh, Mr. Drebin, I want to go straight.
I'm tired of the lies.
Oh, kiss me.
Please, kiss me.
I've never kissed lips so innocent, so pure.
He looked like Phil Donahue.
White hair.
That's the guy.
To present the Best Picture Award are two very distinguished actors.
Olympia Dukakis and James Earl Jones.
- Oh, Lord.
What's that?
- Phil Donahue throwing up in a tuba.
Make a note about not having Phil Donahue back next year.
Thank you.
Good evening.
It's a privilege to present the final award of tonight's ceremony.
We've been worried about you.
Where's Rocco and Tanya?
- Sit down.
Take it easy.
- Thank God you're all right.
"Indecent Instincts" and "Sawdust and Mildew".
Oddly enough, all these movies are box office hits, except one.
- What's that?
- It's the Best Picture Award.
Olympia, would you do the honors?
Oh, my God.
That's the one!
The award for this year's best picture goes to...
- Wait!
- Oh, great.
Sorry.
Loved you in "Coneheads".
You, too.
Let me open this.
It's the bomb!
Freeze, and nobody gets hurt!
Well, from now on.
Take your seats, the party's over!
This programme's been stopped.
OK, don't panic.
Camera 2, move in on the old lady.
Better move back, 2.
- I said, "Nobody moves."
- Sit down and pay attention!
I don't want to kill anybody unless I have to.
Drop your guns and kick them over here.
I believe that bomb belongs to me.
Hand it over, Drebin.
You want to do the honors of killing him, Ma?
Blink, and I start shooting.
Give me that gun.
- Oh, my God!
- I'm not falling for that one, sister.
- Ma!
- She's a goner, Rocco.
Dead?
Then that's it.
I'm coming with you, Ma!
- Pull out the bomb, or I'll shoot her.
- All right, Rocco.
All right.
I'll do what you say.
Just don't harm her.
You pull out the bomb, you'll kill me and everyone else.
- No dice, Rocco.
- Then I'll plug her.
- If you do, I'll empty this envelope.
- Frank, think about it.
- It's all right, you'll be dead.
- You'll kill yourself and everyone here.
- Yeah.
- I'll shoot you if you don't do as I say.
- Jane?
- I'd be safe.
So would everyone else.
- But you'd be dead.
- This is getting a little complicated.
Let's be logical.
You're the psycho, you should have this and I the gun.
I know what I'm doing.
All right.
Here's your Best Picture, in front of a worldwide audience.
- This place is going up.
- If I'm going out, I'm going out happy.
Wait, Rocco, before we're all blown to bits.
Mind if I pull the underwear out of my crack?
A man's got to go comfortable.
All right, but that's it.
- Give it up, Rocco, you're history!
- Look, George Hamilton!
Come and get me.
Throw me a gun.
Get rid of the bomb.
Hold on.
Frank, help me!
- Frank!
- I know what I'm doing.
I hate heights.
Move it.
Screw the commercials!
All right, copper.
You killed my ma.
I'm taking the dame away from you.
You hear me, copper?
One push and Mrs. Drebin is linoleum.
Get a camera up there.
This could be my best work!
- Any last words before I throw you off?
- Yes, don't do it.
- Anything else?
- Frank, I love you.
I want the world to know you're the perfect man.
- Frank, I hope you can hear me.
- They told me I couldn't do drama.
I was wrong to take you away from Police Squad.
I know now that's why you couldn't perform sexually.
I realize that and a lot of other things now.
Everything's under control.
Nobody moves!
Any vibration might set this thing off.
Frank, I've learned my lesson.
Even though it may be too late for me, I want all ladies out there to remember:
Don't ever take your men for granted.
Good men don't just fall out of the sky.
He's caught up in the cable.
Frank, do something.
Hurry.
I'm coming, Ma!
- Rocco?
- Pahpshmir?
Jane, I never want us to be apart again.
Oh, Frank, you like me, you really like me.
- Frank, slow down.
- Hurry up, we're late!
- Relax.
Did you bring the camcorder?
- Right here.
- What room is she in?
- Delivery room.
This must be it.
Jane, I'm here.
Frank is here now.
- Push!
Bear down now.
- Breathe, honey.
One more push.
That's it.
Congratulations, Dad.
It's a boy.
Nordberg!
Come back here!
- Frank, it's a boy.
- I know!
Hey, look!
It's the President!
And the Pope!
Oh, my God!
Look!
It's disgruntled postal workers.
Wait a minute!
Give me my baby back!
- Are you all right?
- I'm soaking wet.
- I'll get the talcum powder.
- It's not that.
I had a nightmare.
Crime all around me, I couldn't stop it.
- Frank, it was just a dream.
- You're right.
All I need is a good night's rest.
Tomorrow everything will be fine.
How's my little boy?
Getting along OK, sweetie?
As well as a heterosexual can in prison.
I don't know if I can take it any longer.
- How's Tanya?
- Tanya's the same.
Milky, creamy skin, pouting red lips, firm buttocks, ample breasts, ears you'd love to stick your tongue into...
- I'll get guy cramps if you keep this up.
- Sorry.
There's somebody here to see you.
Pahpshmir!
- My people are very upset.
- Of course, they're Arab terrorists.
You're supposed to be the world's best terrorist bomber.
- Train stations, government buildings.
- The devastation in South Florida.
- That was Hurricane Andrew.
- That's what they told the public.
We wanted to embarrass the USA.
You've made the police look like heroes.
I told you.
A first-class job would cost five million.
If you want to step up the price,
I got a target that'll make City Hall look like chicken feed.
A big target.
Why should anything be different?
Because five million dollars buys me!
I'm breaking out of here.
If you fail this time, Mr. Dillon, my people won't be so forgiving.
Fail?
Show me one man who can stop me.
Attention shoppers, be sure to check out our special on paper towels.
That's aisle seven.
Hey!
- Give it to me!
- My purse!
Somebody help me!
- Let go of the purse, lady!
- Help me!
For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow which nobody can deny.
Well, we shot a lot of people together.
It's been great.
Today I retire.
If I do any shooting now, it'll have to be in my own home.
Hopefully, it'll be an intruder and not an in-law like at my bachelor party.
Ed, I officially give you my gun and my badge.
And...
Jane and I would like to keep the handcuffs as a souvenir.
Cheer up, Ed.
This is not goodbye.
This is just "I won't ever see you again".
- Somebody help me!
- Out of my way!
- It.
Drebin!
Frank!
Didn't you see that?
- What?
Oh...
Yes, kitty litter.
Two bags for a dollar.
Great!
Order.
The jury will disregard that last statement.
Continue, counselor.
- The alimony had been set by the court.
- Yes, but...
You haven't paid alimony in two years, repeatedly defying a court order.
- Isn't that right, Mr. Clayton?
- I'd lost her address.
She moved twice.
Don't lie to me.
You're under oath.
Do you know what the penalty for perjury is?
- I'll ask you that again.
- Objection!
Your Honor, I...
Ow, ow, gee.
- Counsel is leading the witness.
- Sustained!
Mommy said no pounding when she's in session.
Read the prosecution's last statement.
"Don't lie to me, Mr. Clayton.
You're under oath." Good boy.
"Do you know what the penalty for perjury is?"
That's all I have, Your Honor.
You may continue, Ms Spencer-Drebin.
Prosecution rests.
Defense Attorney Ms Davies-Jacobs-Steiner-Lazlo.
No further questions.
Court will recess until after the morning feeding.
- We can win this.
I can feel it.
- Yes, of course.
- I married the wrong man.
- I never thought that was possible.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, nothing.
Louise, there's no such thing as the wrong man.
You just have to work at it.
Now, let's see.
Mr. and Mrs. Drebin, right?
Now, you two have been married for six months?
Yes.
We really appreciate you seeing us, Doctor.
Our last therapist recommended you.
Yes, I was sorry to hear about his suicide.
A couple need to get off on the right foot and not get caught up in blame.
- Now, which one of you is impotent?
- That would be him.
Yes, of course.
- Why don't you ask who's frigid?
- That would be him.
- How would you know?
- He resents that I'm a working woman.
He has no idea what a woman wants or needs.
- You're so insensitive.
- Is this that toilet seat thing?
I want to have a baby.
Every time we make love, you have a headache.
I'm not a piece of meat.
I'm trying!
I've got ointments, lotions, creams, books, things that vibrate...
- Frank!
- Maybe it's your fault.
Have you tried sexy lingerie?
Lacy underwear?
A black teddy?
- I've tried them all.
They don't work.
- Oh!
Why don't you want a child?
Didn't I try to adopt that 18-year old Korean girl?
Jane, Frank, here's what I suggest.
Make tonight a special night.
Dinner, wine, romantic music.
Put on the 24-hour Johnny Mathis station.
Just be Jane and Frank.
Lovers!
We haven't had a night like that in a long time.
- Not together.
- Frank!
Jane, having a baby is a big responsibility.
Like being in charge of sanitation at a Haitian jail.
I'm just frightened.
Let's make tonight something special.
Oh, honey, it's just that I love you so much.
My little lover sparrow.
My puppy wuppy wuvver.
My little love biscuit.
- My little snookie wookums.
- My little lady cheesy puffy.
Mr. and Mrs. Drebin, please, I'm a diabetic.
I think you ought to go now.
- I never thought we'd end this way.
- How did you think we'd end?
I don't know.
Some other way.
Oh, Jason, please...
Bobbi...
- I've been hurt before.
- We have to fight this thing together.
Ed, Nordberg!
It's been a long time!
- Good to see you, buddy.
- You look terrific.
I'm taking a step class, and I got a thigh master for Christmas.
Where are my manners?
Come on in!
- How charming!
- Sit, sit.
Excuse the mess.
It's my ironing day.
I've just frosted some cupcakes.
- Would you care for one?
- Not now.
We're having trouble with a terrorist threat.
- Police Squad is certain that...
- I'd love a cupcake.
- That coffee smells great.
- I grind my own beans.
We're here because we need your help with something.
- They're great!
- I'd hoped you'd like them.
Made from scratch.
I'll just get off my feet.
We may have a lead on a suspect in the City Hall bombing attempt.
These were taken by a photographer.
- She was used as a diversion.
- We've had them enlarged.
- They look familiar.
- No, Frank, the pin.
She's a nurse.
Can I keep this one?
We traced her to the Karlson Clinic on Myrtlewood.
Her name is Tanya Peters.
- Do you know her?
- Don't you remember back in the 70s?
The big disco shoot out.
Hey, Ed.
What's happening, my man?
We missed you last night at the fondue party.
Couldn't make it.
I saw the Village People.
They're gas.
- Far out, I can dig it!
- What's this?
One dead disco dancer.
- Bummer!
What a mind bender.
- We think it was a love triangle.
This is the suspect's girlfriend, Tanya Peters.
- Cigarette?
- Yes, I know.
We'll need a statement from you down at the station.
- Nordberg!
- Coming, lieutenant!
I do remember!
You were one of the first test cases for minoxidol.
- What?
- I'm glad I could be of help.
If you don't mind, I've got a rump of lamb to roast.
- We need a favor.
- It's not that big a rump roast.
It's not that.
We need you to go undercover at the clinic.
I've quit police work.
You're whistling up the wrong neck of the woods.
I wouldn't ask, but we're in a bind.
- What about Hedges and O'Malley?
- They're in Hawaii... together.
I can't.
Jane and I have a special evening planned.
It'll only take a few hours.
Still time to make dinner.
I don't know.
I'll have to make pork chops.
Think of all the crime.
Nobody is safe.
You'd be protecting Jane.
You'd be protecting all the Janes of the world.
- You haven't shot anybody in 6 months.
- That's true.
Funny how you miss the little things.
Might be good to feel cold steel against my thigh again.
The thrill of a chase... to be a man!
After folding the laundry, I set out for the clinic.
Police operations require a foolproof disguise.
This operation was no different.
I had no idea if Tanya would recognize me, so I wore fake glasses.
I combed my hair differently, just in case.
I planned to get in and find out about Tanya's connection with the bombing, and get out as quickly as possible.
I figured faking an old football injury would do the trick.
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see a doctor.
Sign in here, please.
Do you have an appointment, Mr.?
Smith.
No, I don't.
- Then take a number.
- Six.
- What?
- Is six taken?
Does it have to be between one and ten?
- You'll be called.
- Thank you.
Mr. Smith?
We've had a cancellation.
We can take you now.
Dr. Kohlzak?
Good morning, Mr. Smith.
Right this way.
I appreciate you seeing me.
I'm sure it won't take too long.
- When did you first notice the problem?
- In the back yard with my uncle.
- In the back yard?
With your uncle?
- Yes, when he visits we like to go out in the back yard and throw it around.
What did you and your uncle find out?
I can't keep up with him.
Mine hurt, especially on the long ones.
I can't seem to straighten it out.
It has no feeling.
It's kind of numb.
I may have yanked it too much, maybe.
- If you would...
- For what?
- A sperm count.
- In here?
It's not exactly the back yard, but it will do.
Well...
Follow me, and we'll do the necessary paperwork.
Sign these at the bottom, and leave them with the nurse.
- This way, please.
- What?
- Number 17.
- A problem?
- No.
- This is 17.
You're next.
- Have we met before?
- If you excuse me, I'm next.
Sir...
Mr. Smith, how are we doing?
I've been busy, if that's what you mean.
Would you like a video tape to assist you?
Do you have "Dances With Wolves"?
"Rocketeer"? "Lady And The Tramp"?
An adult movie.
The tape was very entertaining.
Follow me.
Do you have "Spartacus"?
Maintenance, clean up Room 7.
Maintenance, clean up Room 7.
Stat.
- What are you doing?
- Freshening up.
You should always look your best, even by yourself.
Are you sure we've never met?
Oh, here's my cup.
Back to work.
Mr. Smith, are you OK in there?
I could use a little help.
Dr. Rosenblatt, foreplay in Room 7, please.
Honey, I've been waiting all day.
I'm wearing the nightgown you bought me for our honeymoon.
Tonight's gonna be special.
I'll make love to you for hours and hours.
Wouldn't Mr. Happy like that?
- Hours?
- Like our first time together.
Why don't I get ready and soak in the tub for a couple of days?
Possibly a week.
So cute!
Let me go and get the oysters and clams.
Here.
I'll shave your back like last time.
Jane, I really don't think we should.
- Frank, what's this?
!
- I fell... on a rake.
You're lying.
Now I know why Ed's been calling.
- You've been back on the case.
- No, I swear.
It's another woman.
In your wildest dreams!
It's bad enough you won't have a baby.
I warned you against working again.
You white Anglo male!
Jane, it was nothing.
I was only doing Ed a small favor.
Some retirement!
I'm leaving.
I never thought you'd go back on your word.
- Aren't you being a little hasty?
- I don't think so.
That's the cab.
You can reach me at Louise's.
How could you?
We need some time apart to think about us.
I'm not going to think.
Why now?
I love you.
Look, I am what I am, and I do what I do.
Some make shoelaces, some make a living neutering animals.
- I am a cop.
- Pretty speech.
My mind is made up, I'm leaving!
All right, then take this with you.
I guess you know how my lips feel about things.
Goodbye, Frank.
Your listening to K.S.A.D. All depressing, all the time.
Here's a dedication to Frank from Jane calling from a taxi.
You not only shoot blanks, you leave the door open, letting the heat out.
Were you born in a barn?
He wouldn't do any more police work.
Once a cop, always a cop.
- He's married to his work, not me.
- You'll come second.
There's an article in Cosmo, "Why All Men Are Pigs".
Read it!
Frank's just another word for "loser".
I never want to see him again.
I want to get far away from here.
We'll go to my friend's cabin.
The fresh air will do you good.
Go easy!
That's your second bottle of Chanel.
This is the beginning of a new Jane Spencer-Drebin.
No more Miss Perky who devoted her life to one man.
I'm out for the new me.
Let's burn rubber!
- Have you forgotten anything?
- I hope not.
Calm down.
How many bodies did you find in your pool?
In this state killing a gang member is only an $18 fine.
- Frank!
Glad you could make it.
- Welcome, buddy.
- Nordberg, Ed.
- Did you find Tanya's address?
I wrote it down on a hanky, and I can't remember what I did with it.
- I'm getting rusty.
- That could happen to anybody.
I brought you some of "Frank's Never Fail Fudge".
- Go on about your business.
- Smells great.
- I'll stay out of your hair.
- It'll be just like...
Frank, let me get that.
We have a surprise for you.
In honor of your 30 years on the force.
Nordberg!
Oh, boy.
This is really great.
Thank you, guys.
It might cheer you up.
We heard about you and Jane.
Jane, Jane...
The name will always remind me of her.
I feel bad about this.
If there's anything you need?
- Like Dr. Kevorkian's home number.
- Nordberg, put it together!
- We're here for you.
- Thanks.
- Look who's here.
Nice to see you.
- Ted.
- I have data for you on the bomb.
- What did you find out?
- The explosive is a very fine powder.
- It tastes like...
That's fertilizer.
It's for another case.
This is what I'm talking about.
- We detected nitroglycerine.
- Can you tell us where it came from?
I'd be glad to.
Billions of years ago, the earth was a molten mass...
- I mean the powder.
- We have no clue.
Let me take that urine, Frank.
We found a list of the bomber's plans at the scene.
- We analyzed the paper.
- And?
The paper is from Statesville Prison.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
The wood is from the rare Canary Island Pine.
It only grows in Oregon.
Contacting paper mills led us to a distribution center in Tacoma.
There the trail ended.
- How did you trace it to Statesville?
- The letterhead.
We compared the handwriting of all bombers serving in Statesville and found a suspect, Rocco Dillon.
He's masterminding the bombings from the prison.
If so, there's only one way to find out where Rocco'll strike next.
- We'll have to send someone in prison.
- I'll do it.
I wouldn't feel right about that.
If Rocco finds out, you might end up dead.
"You might end up dead" is my middle name.
- What about Jane?
- I don't know hers.
I need the action.
I'm going inside the big house.
Frank, Ed, you might want to see this.
We're testing a prototype for a new anti-carjacking device.
You'll get to see how it works.
- Get out!
- No.
Don't make me use...
"The Denver Jockstrap".
After being retired for six months, I was back in action.
Faster than you say "Spread 'em!", I was inside Statesville Prison.
I was surrounded by pimps, rapists and murderers.
It was like being in the stands of an LA Raiders' game.
It was going to take all my police experience just to stay alive in here.
After a long and generous cavity search, I reached my destination:
Maximum security, home of some of the country's most violent sociopaths.
And the worst of them all, Rocco Dillon.
All right, in here.
Ain't no prison yet could hold me.
Attica!
Attica!
Power to the brothers.
Kill whitey, kill whitey!
Knock it off!
You're chirping loud for a new canary.
Keep flashing your eyes, and I'll balance your jaw.
Hey!
You know who you're talking to?
The man is Rocco Dillon.
- Where's your prison number?
- It's unlisted.
Just call me Nick "The Slasher" Magirk.
Look, ham head.
I'm the muscle in this pen.
Stay out of my way.
Just watch your step, Magirk.
Take it from me, this place changes a man.
- Oh, yeah, in what way?
- I used to be white.
I was the drummer for the Osmonds.
Screw with me, he'll make you feel pain you've never felt before.
I know, I remember the Osmonds.
- Better hit the rack, Magirk.
- In a minute.
First I'll make a list of the people I'm gonna kill in the next few days.
Lights out!
Lock down in two minutes!
My dearest snookie wookums buns,
I miss you so much.
I haven't felt this bad since... the last time I was dumped.
I remember it well.
Her name was Gabriella.
We were supposed to marry, but on our wedding day, she never showed up.
I was heartbroken, destroyed.
I figured she'd fallen for another man.
Someone who could do to her what I never could.
I thought my life was over until that one glorious day.
That was the day you became my wife.
All our friends celebrated our love.
It seemed like only yesterday.
We were all so overjoyed.
We wished they all could come with us.
That was the happiest day of my life.
I'll never forget the plans we made.
Things were going to be perfect.
We were going to get that housekeeper you always wanted.
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. D.
I knew that eventually our dream would come true.
One day we'd have our own Frank Drebin Jr.
Shut up, Magirk.
I'm trying to sleep.
It's no use.
She'll never come back.
Bend over and pick it up for me would you, lover?
No problem.
Rocco could tell from my escapade in the shower that I was courageous.
Now, I had to get on the inside.
Like a blind man at an orgy, I would have to feel things out.
Tyrone, I've got the escape plans here.
Just you and me.
- Burnett wants in, too.
- He's a guard!
- I know, but he's unhappy here.
- All right, whatever.
Got it all worked out right here.
What's this?
Another letter from your mommy?
- That's private, screw.
- Let's have a look.
- Give him back his letter.
- Buzz off, butter cheeks.
What's so special about a little letter?
Wait a minute... an escape plan!
This is your ticket to another 20 years.
If the Warden gets one look...
You call this slop?
Real slop has got chunks of things in it.
This is more like gruel!
This Chateau LeBlanc '68 is supposed to be served slightly chilled.
This is room temperature.
- What do you think we are?
Animals?
- No!
What are we?
Homo sapiens?
You're right!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
No, no.
Stop!
Right hand red, left hand blue.
Who's got a hand in my pocket?
Come on, son.
You can do it.
Eat some beans.
You saved my bacon.
I'd be in solitary if you hadn't done that.
You've been handling yourself really good.
- Really well.
- Whatever.
I've got something big coming up.
I could have use for you.
You've got a dental plan?
What's the caper?
We've got to bust out of this playpen.
Thanks to you, we have an escape plan.
- It's a good plan.
- I've had better.
Listen, I've got a foolproof plan.
They've got Tyrone.
Can't we all just get along?
Now that Tyrone was in solitary, it was just me and Rocco.
He had no choice but to trust me...
Shh!
Hold on!
Anyway, I convinced Rocco to dig a tunnel.
It was either that or the laundry truck.
The thought of lying nose down in underwear with skid marks didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.
Disposing of the dirt was a problem I solved early.
Outside of some major chaffing, we made good progress.
We kept digging, and dummies gave the impression we were in our cell.
Lights out, Magirk.
There was more dirt than I anticipated.
Disposing of it was tricky.
Safe!
Where are you going?
Are you thinking of Frank again?
- They are playing our song.
- I understand.
Take your time.
- Hello, there.
- Excuse me.
I'm hauling a load of rice cakes to Big D.
- Why don't you come?
- No.
- How about a kiss?
- No!
I know women mean "yes" when they say "no".
How about that kiss?
- Yes.
- What do you mean "no"?
Come on, baby, we're two of a kind.
- You killed him!
- It was an accident.
Call the police.
Come to your senses.
You killed a man.
You're a hero to all American women!
Call Frank.
He'll protect us.
He's a man.
He'll lock you away for life.
I wanna help you kill as many men as possible.
Do what you have to do.
I'm calling Frank.
Be home, Frank, please.
Answer the phone, snuggle pants.
Frank!
- Hi, this is Frank.
- And Jane.
We're the Drebins.
We're not home right now.
Leave a message.
- Which button do I press?
- Not that one.
Tanya?
It was another woman.
Frank was telling the truth.
Honeymoon Bay Road, I bet they're there right now.
Oh, Frank!
Cell inspection!
There's been a rumor of a possible break-out.
If we suspect anyone of attempting to escape, they will be punished severely.
Once word of the escape was out, we had to move for the tunnel.
The last few feet had to be dug on the run.
We were sure that another 47 yards would take us beyond the prison walls.
May he rest in peace in the arms of our loving...
Jesus Christ!
Amen.
Rocco had arranged for a getaway car to meet us.
After adjusting our direction, we arrived at the rendezvous point a Los Angeles city high school.
Hey, that was close.
Hey, Rocco, who's the old hag?
- She take one in the face?
- She's my mother!
Mrs. Dillon, your son is a ruthless, sadistic, cold-blooded animal.
- You must be very proud of him.
- I am.
Ma, I want you to meet a real square egg, Nick "The Slasher" Magirk.
There are fresh clothes in the back.
Rocco's mother was quiet.
I sensed she didn't like me coming along.
Like a midget at a urinal, I would have to stay on my toes.
Hey!
Stop!
Oh, Frank!
It wasn't my fault.
That cow shouldn't have been on the road.
Hurry up, you're letting the flies in!
- What do you think, kid?
- Sweet setup.
No phones.
Miles from the nearest town.
Playboy Channel.
Perfect.
Nice digs, but I'm here for the action.
Are we taking banks or armored cars?
- You're getting too nosy, Magirk.
- Relax, Ma.
- She's been itching to try this gun.
- I know the feeling.
It was Tanya.
That bathing suit was never happier.
I had only a second to admire the view.
I had to watch out.
If she made me as a cop, I'd be tonight's meat loaf.
- Come here, sexy.
- You're all woman.
I can tell.
Hey, she's referring to me.
I was talking about your mother.
That's no way to be walking around.
Get clothes on.
And what are you doing in my bathing suit?
- Hey, who's the stud?
- Meet our newest gang member.
Slasher Magirk, meet Tanya Peters.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
I smelt cop the minute I saw him.
I get that all the time.
The underwear ads.
Are you saying you're not a cop?
Well, yeah.
- That's good enough for me.
- I'm fine.
I'm glad that's all cleared up.
Ma, why don't you two kiss and make up?
Well, all right.
That's more like it.
I had to get a message to the squad.
This was more than I could handle by myself.
No phone and miles from people, I was worse off than a gerbil in a bath house.
Who's there?
Slasher, have you seen my pigeon?
Pigeon?
What pigeon?
- What are you doing?
- I'm just contemplating my next move.
Your bishop is exposed.
It's these pants.
I usually wear a fuller cut.
You're all man.
I like that in my men.
You're coming on to me big time, purring like a kitten with a mouse.
- But we got a problem.
- You're Jewish?
No.
You're Rocco's girl.
In my book that chapter is called "Look, But Don't Touch".
I could have two lovers.
Kinky.
But I like my sex the way I play basketball, one on one and with as little dribbling as possible.
You're tense, Slasher.
I could relax more, if I knew what was on tomorrow.
Do you know anything about that?
All I know is that it's downtown and... big.
That's the way I like it.
What else?
Just this...
- What are you doing?
- Thank you for the advice.
- I'll try that recipe out, Ms Peters.
- How could you?
You shove your tongue as far down as you can.
Quiet.
You're not supposed to know me here.
That's a goodbye kiss, sister.
- What's this?
Who's the skirt?
- Just some dizzy dame.
Her car broke down.
I'll take her to the bus.
Look, she's married.
What if her husband comes here?
- He will.
He must be great.
- He breaks promises.
And you traipse all over to spite a wonderful guy.
- He left me.
- You left him.
- You should talk!
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you!
- Listen to you!
You two, knock it off!
You'd think you were married.
- What do you want to do with her?
- One thing is for sure there's no room for her here.
- I say we bump her off.
- Let's plug her.
- No.
I was on a job that went hooey.
I'd have given my eyeteeth for a hostage.
Women make the best ones.
They are smaller, easy to take along, eat less, smell nice.
Yeah, we got us an insurance policy.
Good thinking, kid.
Come on, let's get some shut-eye.
We got a big day ahead of us.
It's rigged.
Keep your eye on the tower.
- It's what's going to happen tonight.
- Aren't we awfully far away?
On the top of that tower is a device that's going to net us five million bucks.
A thing I've been working on.
We'll detonate it this evening at an event the whole world will be watching.
- Your crowning achievement.
- It's for both of us, Ma.
- All set?
- Set.
Very impressive.
Cool.
Cool.
America will be brought to its knees by this terrorist act.
It'll be more embarrassing to the US than Tonya Harding.
We're there.
Give my regards to Mrs. Gaddafi.
And tell her thanks for the cookies.
It's another beautiful night in LA, and the stars are shining bright for the 66th annual Academy Awards.
Fans are clamoring to see their favorite celebrities.
Here are two, "Weird Al" Yankovic and Vanna White.
Slasher, put the dame in the trunk.
I'll meet you and Ma around the back in ten minutes.
Got the passes?
- We pull this up, it's 5 million big ones.
- Not bad, Ma.
- What's going to happen to me?
- I have an idea.
- Slasher, you know what to do.
- Right.
Check the spare tire and all fluid levels.
No, keep an eye on the dame.
We hit trouble, she's a bullet shield.
Ladies and gentlemen, to present the Academy's Lifetime Achievement...
Ready, 3.
Roll tape.
Go to clip.
Aspirin, please.
Go to 3.
Ready, 4.
This year's Lifetime Achievement Award winner's credits include great films.
"Sandals and Loincloth", 1958.
"Sweaty Boatmen", 1959.
"The Leather Clad Centurion", 1960, and his first color feature in 1966, "Big Shiny Spears".
There's the man from Bryce/Porterhouse.
He guards the envelopes until they're handed out.
He won't budge from there.
Distract him so I can plant the bomb in an envelope.
Accepting the award for Mr. Bronkowitz is Margaret Red Feather.
That ought to do it.
You'll pay for this.
Rocco'll kill you whoever you are.
- Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Isn't that a little unusual?
- It happened to me.
Here's the plan.
- You'll never stop Rocco.
- Your chances are one in a million.
- Better than any state lottery.
I'm the good guy.
I can't let the bad guys win.
Our children can't be raised in fear.
If we can't stop them, they'll blow that place up.
It'll be a tragedy, unless it happens during a dance number.
Come on.
Does that radio work?
Call Police Squad.
Tell them Frank Drebin...
Forget it.
I wonder what the devil he wanted?
- Hold on.
- Sergeant Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Yeah, and I'm Robert De Niro.
- Mr. De Niro, we've got to get inside.
You and 10,000 other people.
Move along.
Movie stars only.
Come on.
I've got a better idea.
And cue talent.
To present the award for Best Supporting Actress Mariel Hemingway and Elliot Gould.
Thank you.
The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are:
Mary Lou Retton, "Fatal Affair", one woman's ordeal to overcome the death of her cat, set against the background of the Hindenburg disaster.
Morgan Fairchild, "Final Proposal", one courageous pioneer woman's triumphant victory over bulimia, set against the background of the Donner Party Crossing.
Sorry, but this is official police business.
Shannen Doherty, "Basic Analysis", one woman's triumph over a yeast infection, set against the background of the tragic Buffalo Bill season of 1991.
Thank you, sheriff.
Still no word of Frank or Rocco's gang.
I'm worried.
He should've phoned in.
Let me check your tickets.
Lovely gown.
Is that Cool Whip?
All right, Tim and Erica Brown.
OK, enjoy the show.
Let's see.
Vanna White and "Weird Al" Yankovic.
OK!
Ready, 3... and 3.
And Florence Henderson, "Analysis of a Proposal"...
- Rocco could be anywhere.
- He's had time to plant the bomb.
- And the winner is...
- This is going to be dynamite.
- Jane.
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yes.
Florence Henderson'll win.
It's about time.
- No, the bomb is in an envelope.
- You're right!
And the winner is Mary Lou Retton for "Fatal Affair".
I'm sorry, we were rooting for Florence Henderson.
We've got to get to the envelopes.
- So many.
- They added 75 categories.
"Best Actor in a Columbus movie"?
Best Director is presented by star of stage and screen Raquel Welch and host of his own award-winning talk show Phil Donahue.
That might be the envelope for the bomb.
Keep looking here.
One more second, Mr. Donahue.
Oh, my God!
Look at Donahue.
Stop the stairs, Joey.
Joey!
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to present the...
What the hell?
!
- Jesus!
- Go to commercial.
Easy now.
Talk to me.
What happened, Ma?
Slasher is Frank Drebin of Police Squad.
Lousy, two-bit copper!
I treated him like my brother... the one I didn't kill.
- He might find the bomb.
- Not if I find him first.
- Back from commercial in 5 seconds.
- Hurry up with the mike.
Cue Donahue.
Read it.
Read the card, moron.
"Well, Raquel, this certainly is a special evening.
Phew!"
"I can barely catch my breath.
Turn it over to Raquel."
"Raquel:
I'm used to being out of breath, working out to my..."
What's he doing?
!
"Hold for laughter.
To Phil.
Gets me out of breath just watching you."
- "To Raquel.
Oh, Phil..."
- I'm supposed to read that.
"Let's get to the subject at hand.
Pick up the envelope..."
The nominees for best director are:
Sir Richard Attenborough for his musical based on the life of Mother Teresa, "Mother".
Food, I love food and I'm really in the mood for a big corn dog of pooh-pooh platter two ding-dongs, it doesn't matter and some tuna helper, I'll be racing back for more
But don't get any sausage 'cause I'll blow chunks on the floor
Spike Lee, "X II
- The Merchandising"
Nordberg, look.
That's Frank at the Academy Awards.
How did he get tickets?
That's where Rocco Dillon is going to strike next, the Academy Awards.
- We have to get there.
- We're not invited.
We're cops.
- It's for you.
- Nordberg, Police Squad.
Hello.
Hello.
Henderson, see about this phone.
I think it's broke.
And now, here are today's lucky lotto numbers.
Get your tickets ready because here they come: 12, 22, 18 and 9.
And for his tale of genetics gone haywire in a retirement community,
Steven Spielberg, "Geriatric Park".
And the winner is...
- Raquel, just a second.
- Now what?
- I just had a thought.
- Oh, Christ.
This show is being seen all over the world, I was thinking if we could all send good thoughts through these cameras to men like the leader of China, Wing Wa Woo Tong, so that they might finally be nice.
Thank you.
And the winner is...
Raquel, so many go to bed hungry in this nation, yet cat food is full of tuna.
Each time I go to the zoo and see those porpoises crammed into tiny tanks,
I think, "What a waste that is."
Butcher half of them now!
That's a lot of dolphin meat that can be fed to our cats, freeing up that tuna for our nation's hungry.
- And the winner is...
- So many are cold, shivering in the night.
So I say, "Take those cats, skin them."
- "Use their fur to keep hundreds warm."
- Jesus, Phil.
And the winner is...
- You!
- Give me that!
- Not one move.
- That barrel's cold.
It's OK.
It's not the bomb.
- Jane.
Jane!
- Big trouble!
Jane.
Silver hair.
Kind of looked like Phil Donahue.
That's the guy!
Please welcome internationally renowned actress and singing star
Pia Zadora.
- Excuse me, is that snot on your shoe?
- Snot?
Where?
Oh, no.
Not him again.
Please, God.
Get off the stage!
Ed Hocken and Nordberg from Police Squad.
- We're here to prevent a disaster.
- Too late for that.
It's Frank.
Come on, Nordberg.
We've got to get to Frank.
Jane!
Jane!
I knew I'd bump into you somewhere.
I want answers, cherry cakes.
- I love you.
- Wrong answer.
I quit the Sap-of-the-Month Club long ago.
Angel drawers, you've got one last chance.
Not one of those Major-League- Baseball-Steve-Howe last chances.
- Where is Jane?
- I swear I don't know.
- Where is the bomb?
- In the Best Picture envelope.
Oh, Mr. Drebin, I want to go straight.
I'm tired of the lies.
Oh, kiss me.
Please, kiss me.
I've never kissed lips so innocent, so pure.
He looked like Phil Donahue.
White hair.
That's the guy.
To present the Best Picture Award are two very distinguished actors.
Olympia Dukakis and James Earl Jones.
- Oh, Lord.
What's that?
- Phil Donahue throwing up in a tuba.
Make a note about not having Phil Donahue back next year.
Thank you.
Good evening.
It's a privilege to present the final award of tonight's ceremony.
We've been worried about you.
Where's Rocco and Tanya?
- Sit down.
Take it easy.
- Thank God you're all right.
"Indecent Instincts" and "Sawdust and Mildew".
Oddly enough, all these movies are box office hits, except one.
- What's that?
- It's the Best Picture Award.
Olympia, would you do the honors?
Oh, my God.
That's the one!
The award for this year's best picture goes to...
- Wait!
- Oh, great.
Sorry.
Loved you in "Coneheads".
You, too.
Let me open this.
It's the bomb!
Freeze, and nobody gets hurt!
Well, from now on.
Take your seats, the party's over!
This programme's been stopped.
OK, don't panic.
Camera 2, move in on the old lady.
Better move back, 2.
- I said, "Nobody moves."
- Sit down and pay attention!
I don't want to kill anybody unless I have to.
Drop your guns and kick them over here.
I believe that bomb belongs to me.
Hand it over, Drebin.
You want to do the honors of killing him, Ma?
Blink, and I start shooting.
Give me that gun.
- Oh, my God!
- I'm not falling for that one, sister.
- Ma!
- She's a goner, Rocco.
Dead?
Then that's it.
I'm coming with you, Ma!
- Pull out the bomb, or I'll shoot her.
- All right, Rocco.
All right.
I'll do what you say.
Just don't harm her.
You pull out the bomb, you'll kill me and everyone else.
- No dice, Rocco.
- Then I'll plug her.
- If you do, I'll empty this envelope.
- Frank, think about it.
- It's all right, you'll be dead.
- You'll kill yourself and everyone here.
- Yeah.
- I'll shoot you if you don't do as I say.
- Jane?
- I'd be safe.
So would everyone else.
- But you'd be dead.
- This is getting a little complicated.
Let's be logical.
You're the psycho, you should have this and I the gun.
I know what I'm doing.
All right.
Here's your Best Picture, in front of a worldwide audience.
- This place is going up.
- If I'm going out, I'm going out happy.
Wait, Rocco, before we're all blown to bits.
Mind if I pull the underwear out of my crack?
A man's got to go comfortable.
All right, but that's it.
- Give it up, Rocco, you're history!
- Look, George Hamilton!
Come and get me.
Throw me a gun.
Get rid of the bomb.
Hold on.
Frank, help me!
- Frank!
- I know what I'm doing.
I hate heights.
Move it.
Screw the commercials!
All right, copper.
You killed my ma.
I'm taking the dame away from you.
You hear me, copper?
One push and Mrs. Drebin is linoleum.
Get a camera up there.
This could be my best work!
- Any last words before I throw you off?
- Yes, don't do it.
- Anything else?
- Frank, I love you.
I want the world to know you're the perfect man.
- Frank, I hope you can hear me.
- They told me I couldn't do drama.
I was wrong to take you away from Police Squad.
I know now that's why you couldn't perform sexually.
I realize that and a lot of other things now.
Everything's under control.
Nobody moves!
Any vibration might set this thing off.
Frank, I've learned my lesson.
Even though it may be too late for me, I want all ladies out there to remember:
Don't ever take your men for granted.
Good men don't just fall out of the sky.
He's caught up in the cable.
Frank, do something.
Hurry.
I'm coming, Ma!
- Rocco?
- Pahpshmir?
Jane, I never want us to be apart again.
Oh, Frank, you like me, you really like me.
- Frank, slow down.
- Hurry up, we're late!
- Relax.
Did you bring the camcorder?
- Right here.
- What room is she in?
- Delivery room.
This must be it.
Jane, I'm here.
Frank is here now.
- Push!
Bear down now.
- Breathe, honey.
One more push.
That's it.
Congratulations, Dad.
It's a boy.
Nordberg!
Come back here!
- Frank, it's a boy.
- I know!
" ThE EnD "
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it!
:
D
Hey, look!
It's the President!
And the Pope!
Oh, my God!
Look!
It's disgruntled postal workers!
Wait a minute!
Give me my baby back!
- Frank!
Are you all right?
- I'm soaking wet.
- I'll get the talcum powder.
- No, I had a nightmare.
There was crime all around me.
I couldn't stop it.
- It was a dream.
- You're right.
All I need is a good rest.
In the morning everything'll be fine.
How's my little boy?
Getting along OK, sweetie?
As well as a heterosexual can in prison.
I don't know how much longer I can take it.
- How's Tanya?
- Tanya's the same.
Milky, creamy skin, pouting red lips, firm buttocks, ample breasts, ears you want to stick your tongue into.
Ma!
I'll get guy cramps!
Sorry.
Rocco, there's somebody here to see you.
Papshmir.
My people are very upset.
They're always upset.
They're Arab terrorists.
Ma, please.
You're supposed to be the best terrorist bomber in the world.
Stations, stores, government buildings...
The devastation in Florida.
- That was Hurricane Andrew.
- That's what they told the public.
We wanted to embarrass the United States, and you made the police look like international heroes.
A first-class job costs five million.
If you want to step up to the price,
I got a target that'll make City Hall look like chicken feed.
That's a big target, but why should I think anything would be different?
$5 million buys me.
- I'm breaking out of here.
- All right, but fail this time and my people won't be so forgiving.
Fail?
Show me one man who can stop me.
Attention shoppers.
Be sure to check out our special on aisle 7.
That's aisle 7.
Give it to me!
My purse!
Somebody help me!
- I want the purse, lady.
- Help me!
Well...
We shot a lot of people together.
It's been great.
But today I retire, so if I do any shooting now, it'll have to be within the confines of my own home.
Hopefully, an intruder and not an in-law, like at my bachelor party.
Well, Ed.
I officially give you my gun.
And my... badge.
And, uh...
Jane and I would like to keep the handcuffs as a souvenir.
Cheer up, Ed.
This is not goodbye.
It's just I won't ever see you again.
My purse!
Somebody help me!
Out of the way.
Lieutenant Drebin!
Frank!
- Didn't you see that?
- What?
Oh, yes.
Kitty litter.
Two bags for a dollar.
Great.
Order.
The jury will disregard that statement.
Continue, Counsellor.
Alimony had been set by the court.
Right, Mr Clayton?
Yes, but...
But not once have you paid alimony to my client, repeatedly defying a court order.
I lost her address.
She moved twice, I couldn't keep up.
Don't lie to me.
You're under oath.
Do you know the penalty for perjury?
I'll ask that again.
Objection!
Your Honour, I...
- Counsel is leading the witness.
- Sustained.
Sweetie, mommy said no pounding when she's in session.
Please read the prosecution's last statement.
"Don't lie to me.
You're under oath."
There.
"Do you know the penalty for perjury?"
That's all I have, Your Honour.
You may continue, Ms Spencer-Drebin.
Er... prosecution rests.
Defence, Ms Davis-Jacob-Steiner-Laszlo?
No further questions, Your Honour.
Court will recess until after the morning feed.
We're gonna win this.
I can feel it.
Yes.
Of course.
I married the wrong man.
I never thought that was possible.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, nothing.
Louise, there's no such thing as the wrong man.
You just have to work at it.
Mr and Mrs Drebin, right?
Now, you two have been married... for six months?
Yes.
We really appreciate you seeing us, Doctor.
You were recommended by our last therapist.
Yes, I was sorry to hear about his suicide.
You know, I feel it's important to get off on the right foot and not get caught up in blame.
Now, which one of you is impotent?
- That would be him.
- Yes, of course.
- Why don't you ask who's frigid?
- That would be him, also.
- How do you know?
You're never home.
- He resents that I work.
He has no idea what a woman wants.
You're so insensitive.
- Is this the toilet seat thing?
- It's babies, Frank.
I want to have a baby.
Whenever we make love, you get a headache.
I'm not a piece of meat, Jane.
I'm trying.
I've got ointments, lotions, creams, books, things that vibrate.
Maybe it's your fault.
Have you tried sexy lingerie?
Some lacy underwear, a black teddy?
I've worn them all.
They don't work.
Why don't you want a child?
Didn't I try to adopt that 18-year-old Korean girl?
Jane, Frank, here's what I suggest.
Make tonight a special night.
Dinner, wine, romantic music.
Put on the 24-hour Johnny Mathis station.
Just be Jane and Frank, lovers.
We haven't had a night like that in... in a long time.
Not together.
Having a baby is a big responsibility.
It's like being in charge of sanitation at a Haitian jail.
I'm just frightened.
Frank, let's make tonight something special.
Oh, honey, it's just that I love you so much.
My little lover sparrow.
My... puppy-wuppy wover.
My little love biscuit.
My little shnooky-wookums.
My little lady cheesy puppy.
Mr and Mrs Drebin, please.
I'm diabetic.
I think you should go now.
I never thought we'd end this way.
How did you think we'd end?
I don't know.
Some other way.
Oh, Jason.
Ed!
Nordberg!
It's been a long time.
Hiya, Frank!
You look terrific!
Thank you.
The little woman got me a Thighmaster.
Where are my manners?
Come on in.
How charming!
Sit, sit.
Excuse the mess.
It's my ironing day.
I just frosted some cupcakes.
- Would you care for one?
- Oh, not just now.
Frank, we have a problem with a terrorist threat.
- Police Squad is certain...
- I'd love a cupcake.
- That coffee smells great.
- I grind my own beans.
Frank, the reason we're here is that we need your help.
It's great!
I hoped you'd like them.
Made them from scratch.
I'll just get off my feet.
We may have a lead on a suspect in the City Hall bombing attempt.
These were taken by a news photographer.
- This girl was the diversion.
- We had them enlarged.
- They look familiar.
- No, the pin, she's a nurse.
Can I keep this one?
We traced her to the Karlson Clinic on Myrtlewood.
- She's Tanya Peters.
- Tanya Peters?
- You know her?
- Don't you remember in the 1970s?
The big disco shoot-out.
Ed, what's happenin', my man?
Frank, we missed you last night at the fondue party.
I went to see the Village People.
They're a stone soul gas, man.
- I can dig it.
- What have we got here?
One dead disco dancer.
Bummer.
What a mindbender, huh?
We think it was a love triangle.
This is the suspect's girlfriend, Tanya Peters.
Cigarette?
Yes, I know.
Well... we'll need a statement from you down at the station.
Coming, Lieutenant!
I do remember.
You were one of the first test cases for monoxodyl, weren't you?
- What?
- I'm glad I could help.
Now, I've got some lamb to put in the oven.
We need a favour.
It's not that big a roast, Nordberg.
No, not that, Frank.
We need you to go undercover at the clinic.
Whoa!
I've given up police work, Ed.
You're whistling up the wrong neck of the woods.
- We're in a bind, Frank.
- What about Hedges and O'Malley?
They're in Hawaii.
Together.
Well, I can't.
Jane and I have a special evening planned.
You'll be home in time to make dinner.
I'd have to make pork chops.
Frank, think of all the crime out there.
Nobody is safe.
You'd be protecting Jane.
You'd be protecting all the Janes of the world.
And you haven't shot anybody in months.
That's true.
Funny how you miss the little things.
Might be good to feel that cold, hard steel pressed against my thigh once again.
The thrill of the chase, to be a man.
After folding the laundry, I went to the Karlson Clinic.
It's always important to have a disguise.
And this operation was no different.
I had no idea if Tanya would recognise me, so I slipped on a fake pair of glasses and combed my hair differently.
The plan was to get in, get information about Tanya's link with the bombing, and get out as quickly as possible.
I figured faking an old football injury would do the trick.
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see a doctor, please.
Sign in here, please.
- Do you have an appointment, Mr...?
- Er, Smith.
No, I don't.
Take a number.
Six.
- What?
- Is six taken?
Does it have to be between 1 and 10?
You'll be called.
Thank you.
Mr Smith?
We've had a cancellation.
We can take you now.
Good morning, Mr Smith.
This way.
I really appreciate your seeing me like this.
I'm sure it won't take too long.
KARLSON SPERM BANK AND FERTILITY CLINIC
When did you notice the problem?
Uh, in the back yard with my uncle.
In the back yard with your uncle?
Yes.
When he comes over to visit, we like to go in the back yard, throw it around for a while.
What did you and your uncle find out?
I can't keep up with him.
Mine hurt, especially on the long ones.
I can't seem to straighten it out.
It has no feeling.
It's kind of numb.
I may have yanked it too much.
- If you would.
- For what?
- A sperm count.
- In here?
It's not exactly the back yard, but it'll do.
Well...
Follow me, and we'll do the necessary paperwork.
Sign these at the bottom and leave them with the nurse.
- This way, please.
- What?
- Number 17.
- Oh, no.
- A problem?
- No, no.
- This is 17.
- Have we met before?
If you'll excuse me, I'm next.
Sir?
Mr Smith, how are we doing?
I've been busy.
- Do you want a videotape to help?
- Do you have "Dances With Wolves"?
"Rocketeer"? "Lady And The Tramp"?
An adult movie.
The tape was very entertaining.
Follow me.
Do you have "Spartacus"?

Maintenance.
Cleanup, room 7.
Stat.
- What are you doing?
- Just freshening up.
You should look your best even though you're by yourself.
Are you sure we've never met?
Oh, here's my cup.
Back to work.
Mr Smith?
- Are you OK in there?
- I could use a little help.
Dr Rosenblatt, foreplay in room 7, please.
Dr Rosenblatt.
Honey...
I've been waiting all day.
I'm wearing the nightgown you bought me for our honeymoon.
Tonight's going to be special.
I'm going to make love to you for hours and hours.
Wouldn't Mr Happy like that?
- Hours?
- Like our first time together.
Jane, why don't I soak in the tub for a couple of days?
Possibly a week.
You're so cute.
Let me go get the oysters and clams.
Here.
I'll shave your back like last time.
Jane, I really don't think we should.
I...
Frank!
What's this?
I... fell on a rake.
You're lying.
Now I know why Ed's been calling.
- You're back on a case, aren't you?
- No, I swear.
It's another woman!
In your wildest dreams!
It's bad enough not having a baby, but I warned you about Police Squad, you white Anglo male!
It was nothing, Jane.
I was doing Ed a small favour!
Some retirement.
I'm leaving, Frank.
I never thought you'd go back on your word.
- Aren't you being hasty?
- I don't think so.
That's my cab.
I'll be at Louise's.
Oh, Frank, how could you?
We need time apart to think about us.
I'm not going to think.
Why start now?
I love you.
Look, baby, I am what I am and I do what I do.
A few guys make shoelaces, some lay sod, some make a living neutering animals.
- I'm a cop.
- Pretty speech, Frank.
But my mind is made up.
I'm leaving.
All right.
Then take this with you.
You know how my lips feel about things.
Goodbye, Frank.
You're listening to KSAD, all-depressing, all the time.
Here's a dedication to Frank from Jane, who just called from a taxi.
"Frank, you lying weasel-weenie."
"First you shoot blanks, now you're letting all the heat out..."
He said he'd never go back to police work.
Once a cop, always a cop.
- He's married to his work.
- You'll always come in second.
There was an article in Cosmo - "Why all men are pigs".
"Frank" is just another word for loser.
I never want to see him again.
I want to get as far away as possible.
We'll go to my friend's cabin by the smelting plant.
The fresh air will do you good.
Go easy.
That's your second bottle of Chanel.
You're witnessing the beginning of a new Jane Spencer-Drebin.
No more little miss perky, devoting her life to one man.
I'm out for the new me.
Let's burn rubber.
- Didn't forget anything, did you?
- I hope not.
Just calm down, ma'am.
How many bodies did you find in your pool?
Sir, killing a gang member's only an $18 fine.
Just mail it in.
- Frank!
Glad you could make it!
- Welcome, buddy.
Did you find Tanya's address, Frank?
I wrote it on a hanky, and I can't remember what I did with it.
- I'm getting a bit rusty.
- It could happen to anybody.
I brought you some of Frank's never-fail fudge!
You go on about your business.
I'll stay out of your hair.
It'll be...
Frank, let me take that.
We've got a surprise for you.
It's in honour of your thirty years on the force.
Nordberg.
Oh, boy.
This is really great.
Thank you, guys.
We thought it might cheer you up.
We heard about you and Jane.
Jane, Jane.
That name will always remind me of her.
Frank, I feel really bad about all of this.
If there's anything you need.
Dr Kevorkian's home phone number?
Nordberg, put it together.
- Frank, you know we're here for you.
- Thanks, Ed.
- Well, look who's here.
- Hi, Frank.
Nice to see you.
- I've got that data on the bomb.
- What did you find out?
The explosive is a very fine powder.
- It tastes like...
- That's fertiliser.
Another case.
This is what I'm talking about.
We detected a high quantity of nitroglycerine.
- Can you tell us where it came from?
- I'd be glad to.
Billions of years ago, the Earth was a molten mass...
Ted, I'm talking about the powder.
We don't know about that.
Let me take that urine specimen.
We found a list of the bomber's plans at the scene.
On a hunch, we analysed the paper.
- And you got something?
- Yes.
The paper's from Statesville Prison.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
We analysed the fibres and found them to be from the rare Canary Island pine, which grows only in Oregon.
Contacting paper mills in that area led us to a distribution centre in Tacoma.
Unfortunately, the trail ended there.
- How'd you trace it to the prison?
- Right here on the letterhead.
After comparing handwriting of every known bomber serving a stretch in Statesville, we came up with a suspect - Rocco Dillon.
He's masterminding the bombings from inside the prison.
There's only one way to find out where Rocco will strike next.
We have to send someone in there.
- I'll do it.
- I wouldn't feel right about that.
If Rocco thinks you're a cop, you might end up dead.
"You might end up dead" is my middle name.
What about Jane?
I don't know her middle name.
I need the action.
I'm going inside the big house.
Frank, Ed.
I think you might want to see this.
We're testing out a prototype for an anti-carjacking device.
We'll see how it works.
Get out!
Don't make me...
We call it the Denver jockstrap.
After being retired for six months, I was finally back in action.
Faster than saying "spread 'em", I was in Statesville Prison.
I was surrounded by pimps, rapists and murderers.
It was like being in the stands at an LA Raiders game.
It was going to take all my police experience just to stay alive here.
After a long and generous cavity search,
I reached my destination, Maximum Security, home of some of the most violent sociopaths in the country.
And the worst of them all, Rocco Dillon.
All right, in here.
Ain't no prison yet could hold me.
Attica!
Attica!
Power to the brothers!
Kill whitey!
Kill whitey!
Knock it off!
You're chirping loud for a new canary.
Keep flashing the big eyes and I'll rotate your jaw.
Hey!
You know who you talking to?
The man is Rocco Dillon.
- Where's your prison number?
- It's unlisted.
Just call me Nick "The Slasher" McGirk.
Look, I'm the muscle in this pen.
Just stay out of my way.
You just watch your step, McGirk.
Take it from me, this place changes a man.
Yeah?
How?
I used to be white.
I was the drummer for the Osmonds.
Screw with me, he'll make you feel pain like never before.
I know.
I remember the Osmonds.
- Better hit the rack, McGirk.
- In a minute.
First I'm gonna make a list of who I'm gonna kill in the next few days.
Lights out.
Lockdown in two minutes.
My dearest snooky wookums dumpling buns,
I miss you so much.
I haven't hurt this bad since the last time I was dumped.
I remember it well.
Her name was Gabriella.
We were supposed to be married, but on the day of our wedding, she never showed up.
I was heartbroken.
I figured she had fallen for another man, someone who could do to her what I never could.
I thought my life was over until that one glorious day.
That was the day you became my wife.
Our friends gathered to celebrate our love.
It seems like only yesterday.
We were all so overjoyed.
I remember wishing we could take everyone with us.
That was the happiest day of my life.
I remember the plans we made.
Things were going to be so perfect.
We got that housekeeper you always wanted.
Hi, Mr D. Hi, Mrs D.
And I knew that eventually our dream would come true.
One day we'd have our own Frank Drebin Jr.
Shut up.
I'm trying to get some sleep.
Nah, it's no use.
She'll never come back.
Bend over and pick it up for me, would you, lover?
No problem.
Rocco could tell from my escapade in the shower that I was well-endowed with courage.
Now I had to get on the inside.
Like a blind man at an orgy, I was going to have to feel things out.
Tyrone, I got the escape plans right here.
Just you and me.
- Burnett wants in.
- Burnett's one of the guards!
I know, but he's unhappy here.
All right, all right.
Whatever.
Got it all worked out right here.
What's this?
Another letter from your mommy?
- That's private!
- Let's see what we have.
- Give the man back his letter.
- Buzz off, butter cheeks.
What's so special about a little letter?
Wait a minute...
An escape plan!
This is your ticket to another twenty years, Dillon.
If the warden gets one look at this...
Hey!
You call this slop?
Real slop has got chunks in it!
This is more like gruel!
And this Chateau le Blanc '68 is supposed to be served slightly chilled!
This is room temperature!
What do you think we are, animals?
No!
What are we?
Homo sapiens?
You're right!
We are men!
We are men!
Left hand blue.
Whose hand is that?
Come on, son.
You can do it.
Eat some beans!
You saved my bacon, McGirk.
I'd be in solitary if you hadn't done that.
I've been watching you.
You handle yourself good.
- "Really well".
- Whatever.
I got something big on the outside.
I could use you in my gang.
- Dental plan?
- Full coverage.
- What's the caper?
- First we bust out.
Thanks to you, we still have our escape plan.
Let's have it.
- It's a good plan.
- I've had better.
Listen, I've got a foolproof plan.
They got Tyrone.
Can't...
Can't we all just get along?
Now that Tyrone was in solitary, it was just me and Rocco.
He had to trust me...
Hold on.
OK.
I convinced Rocco to dig a tunnel.
It was that or go out in a laundry truck.
The thought of lying nose down in skidmarks didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.
Disposing of the dirt was a problem I solved early in the construction.
Apart from some chafing, we made good progress.
We kept digging.
Dummies gave the impression we were still in our cell.
Lights out.
There was more dirt than I thought.
Disposing of it was becoming tricky.
Safe!
Where are you going?
- Are you thinking of Frank again?
- They're playing our song.
I understand.
Take your time.
- Hello there.
- Excuse me.
I'm hauling a load of rice cakes to Big D. Coming with me?
No.
- How about a kiss?
- No.
When a woman says no, she means yes.
- How about that kiss?
- Yes.
No?
I know your type.
Come on, baby.
We're two of a kind.
Oh, my God!
You killed him!
It was an accident.
Call the police.
Come to your senses.
You killed a man.
You're a hero to every woman.
We have to call Frank.
He'll protect us.
Frank is a man.
He'll see you locked away forever.
Jane, I want to join you, to help you kill as many men as possible.
Louise, do what you have to do.
I'm calling Frank.
Oh, boy, did that hurt.
Be home, Frank.
Answer the phone.
Hi, this is Frank and Jane.
We're the Drebins.
We're not home right now so leave a message!
- Which button is it?
- Not that one!
Tanya?
It was another woman.
Frank wasn't lying.
Honeymoon Bay Road.
I bet they're alone there now!
Cell inspection.
There's been a rumour of a possible breakout.
If we suspect anyone of attempting to escape, they will be punished severely.
Once word of the escape was out, we headed for the tunnel.
The last few feet were dug on the run.
Another forty-seven yards would take us beyond the prison walls.
May he rest in peace, in the arms of our...
Jesus Christ!
Amen.
Rocco had arranged for a car to meet us.
After making a slight adjustment we arrived at the rendezvous point - a Los Angeles city high school.
Hey, that was close.
Hey, Rocco, who's the old hag?
She take one in the face?
She's my mother.
Mrs Dillon.
Your son is a ruthless, sadistic, cold-blooded animal.
- You must be proud of him.
- I am.
I want you to meet a real square egg,
Nick "The Slasher" McGirk.
There's fresh clothes in the back.
Rocco's mom was quiet.
I felt she didn't care for me coming along.
Like a midget at a urinal,
I was going to have to stay on my toes.
Hey!
Stop!
It wasn't my fault.
That cow shouldn't have been in the road.
Hurry up.
You're letting the flies in.
- What do you think?
- Great setup.
No phone, miles from the nearest town, Playboy channel - perfect.
Nice digs.
But I'm here for the action.
What is it?
Bank, armoured car, payroll?
You're getting a little bit too nosy, McGirk.
Relax, Ma.
- She's itching to use her new gun.
- I know the feeling.
It was Tanya.
That bathing suit was never happier.
I had only a second to admire the view.
I had to watch out.
If she made me as a cop, I'd be tonight's meat loaf.
Come here, sexy.
You're all woman.
I could tell by looking at you.
Hey, she's referring to me.
I was talking about your mother.
That's no way to be walking around.
Get some clothes on.
And what are you doing in my bathing suit?
Hey, who's the stud?
Meet the newest member of our gang.
Slasher McGirk, meet Tanya Peters.
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
I smelled cop on him the minute I saw him.
I get it all the time.
It's the underwear ads.
- Are you saying you're not a cop?
- Well, yeah.
- That's good enough for me.
- Me, too.
All right.
I'm glad that's all cleared up.
Ma, why not kiss and make up?
Well, all right.
Now that's more like it.
I had to get a message to Police Squad.
This was more than I could handle.
No phone, miles from civilisation, my prospects look bleaker than a gerbil's in a bat house.
Who's down there?
Slasher...
Have you seen my pigeon?
- Pigeon?
What pigeon?
- What are you doing?
I'm... just contemplating my next move.
Your bishop is exposed.
It's these pants.
I usually wear a fuller cut.
You're all man.
I like that in my men.
You're coming on to me big-time, sister, but we got a problem.
- You're Jewish?
- No.
You're Rocco's girl.
In my book, that chapter's called "Look, But Don't Touch".
I could have two lovers.
Kinky.
But I like my sex the way I play basketball - one-on-one, with as little dribbling as possible.
Oh, you're tense, Slasher.
Well, I could relax more if I knew about tomorrow.
You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
All I know is it's downtown and... big.
That's the way I like it.
- What else?
- Just this.
What are you doing?
Thank you for the advice.
I'll try that recipe, Miss Peters.
How could you?
Just shove your tongue in as far as you can.
Quiet.
You don't know me here.
That's a goodbye kiss, sister.
What's all this?
Who's the skirt?
Just some dizzy dame.
Probably broke down.
I'll take her to the bus depot.
Hey, she's married.
What if her husband comes looking?
- He must be a great guy.
- He breaks promises.
Look at you, traipsing all over, just to spite him.
- He left me.
- You left him.
- You should talk.
- Listen to you.
Jeez, you two, knock it off!
- You'd think you're married!
- What'll we do with her?
One thing's for sure.
There's no room for her here.
- I say we bump her off.
- Let's plug her here.
I've been on a job where I'd have given my eye teeth for a hostage.
We know women make the best hostages.
They're small, easy to move, eat less, smell nice.
Yeah, we got us an insurance policy.
Good thinking, kid.
Now, let's get some shuteye.
We got a big day ahead of us.
All right, it's rigged.
Watch the tower, Slasher.
This is what'll happen tonight.
Hey, aren't we far away?
All right, pay attention.
On that tower's a device that's gonna net us five million bucks.
We're gonna detonate it this evening at an event that the whole world will be watching.
- Your crowning achievement.
- It's for both of us, Ma.
All set!
Set!
Very impressive.
Cool.
Cool.
America will be brought to its knees by this terrorist act.
This will be more embarrassing to the US than Tonya Harding.
We're almost there.
I don't wanna miss this.
Regards to Mrs Khadafi.
Tell her thanks for the cookies.
It's a beautiful night in Los Angeles, and the stars are shining bright for the 66th Academy Awards.
Fans are clamouring to see their favourite celebrities.
It's Weird Al Yankovic and Vanna White.
Put the dame in the trunk.
I'll meet you and Ma round back in ten minutes.
Got the passes?
If we pull this off, it's five million big ones.
Not bad!
- What's going to happen to me?
- I have an idea.
Right, Slasher.
You know what to do.
Check the tyres and fluid levels.
No, you muffin head, the dame.
We hit trouble, she's a bullet shield.
Ladies and gentlemen, to present the lifetime achievement award...
Roll tape.
Go to clip.
Aspirin, please.
Go to three.
Ready, four.
This year's lifetime achievement award winner's credits include some of the greatest moments on celluloid.
Films such as "Sandals And Loincloth", 1958,
"Sweaty Boatmen", 1959,
"The Leather-clad Centurion", 1960, and his first colour feature in 1966,
"Big Shiny Spears".
OK, there's the man from Bryce Porterhouse.
He guards the envelopes until they're handed out.
He won't budge.
You know what to do.
Distract him so I can plant the bomb.
Accepting the award for Mr Broncowitz is Margaret Redfeather.
That ought to do it.
You'll never get away with this.
Rocco will kill you, whoever you are.
Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Isn't that a unusual?
- It's happened before.
- Here's the plan.
- You'll never stop Rocco.
- Your chances are one in a million.
- Better than any state lottery.
I'm the good guy.
I can't let the bad guys win.
Our children can't be raised in fear.
They're going to blow that place sky high.
It'll be a tragedy.
Unless it's during a dance number.
Come on.
Does that radio work?
Call Police Squad.
Tell them Frank Drebin...
Forget it.
I wonder what the devil he wanted?
- Hold on.
- Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Yeah, and I'm Robert de Niro.
- Mr de Niro, we must get inside.
You and 10,000 other people.
Move along.
- Movie stars only.
- Come on.
I've got a better idea.
Cue talent.
To present the award for best supporting actress,
Mariel Hemingway and Elliott Gould.
Thank you.
The nominees for best supporting actress are...
Mary Lou Retton, "Fatal Affair".
One woman's ordeal to overcome the death of her cat, set against the background of the Hindenburg disaster.
Morgan Fairchild, "Final Proposal".
One courageous pioneer woman's triumphant victory over bulimia, set during the Donner Party crossing.
Sorry about this, but it's official police business.
Shannen Doherty, "Basic Analysis".
One woman's triumph over a yeast infection, set against the background of the tragic Buffalo Bills' season of 1991.
Thank you, Sheriff.
Still no word of Frank or Rocco's gang.
I'm worried.
He should have called by now.
Let me just check your tickets.
- Lovely gown.
Is that cool whip?
- Uh-huh.
Tim and Erica Brown.
OK, enjoy the show.
Let's see, Vanna White and Weird Al Yankovic.
OK, enjoy the awards.
And 3.
And Florence Henderson, "Analysis Of A Proposal".
- Rocco could be anywhere.
- Where could the bomb be?
- The winner is...
- This is going to be dynamite.
- Jane!
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Florence Henderson is going to win!
- No!
The bomb's in the envelope.
- You're right!
And the winner is Mary Lou Retton for "Fatal Affair".
Yes!
Yes!
Sorry.
We were rooting for Florence Henderson.
We must get those envelopes before they open any more.
Yes!
I never realised there'd be so many.
They added 75 new categories.
"Best actor in a Columbus movie"?
To present the award for best director,
Raquel Welch and the host of his own talk show, Phil Donahue.
That might be the envelope with the bomb.
Keep looking.
One more second, Mr Donahue.
Oh, my God!
Look at Donahue!
Stop the stairs, Joey!
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to present...
What the hell?
- Jesus!
- Go to commercial.
Easy, now.
Talk to me.
What happened, Ma?
Slasher is Frank Drebin of Police Squad.
That lousy, two-bit, copper punk!
I treat him like my brother...
the one I didn't kill.
- He might find the bomb.
- Not if I find him first.
Back from commercial in five seconds.
Hurry with the mic and cue Donahue.
Read the card, moron.
"Well, Raquel, this certainly is a special evening.
Phew!"
"I can barely catch my breath.
Turn it over to Raquel."
"I'm used to being out of breath..."
What the hell?
"Hold for laughter and applause.
To Phil."
"Gets me out of breath just watching.
To Raquel..."
I read that.
"But let's get to the subject at hand.
Pick up the envelope."
The nominees for best director are...
Sir Richard Attenborough for his musical on the life of Mother Teresa, "Mother".
Spike Lee, "X II, The Merchandising".
Nordberg, look!
That's Frank at the Academy Awards.
How'd he get tickets?
That's where Rocco is going to strike next.
He's planning to blow up the Academy Awards.
- We've got to go.
- We're not invited.
We're cops.
It's for you.
Nordberg, Police Squad.
Hello?
Hello?
Henderson, see about this phone.
I think it's broke.
And now, today's lucky lotto numbers.
Get your tickets ready, 12, 22, 18, and 9.
And for his tale of genetics gone haywire in a retirement community,
Steven Spielberg, "Geriatric Park".
SEISURE WORLD
The winner is...
Raquel, just a second.
I just had a thought.
Christ!
This show is being seen all over the world.
If we could send good thoughts, transmit them through these cameras, to the leader of China...
Wing Wa Woo Tong... so that they might finally... be nice.
Thank you.
And the winner is...
Raquel, so many go to bed hungry in this nation.
Yet, cat food's full of tuna.
I can't help thinking each time I go to the zoo and see those porpoises crammed into tiny tanks, what a waste that is.
Butcher half of them now.
Hundreds of pounds of dolphin meat that could be fed to cats, freeing up that tuna for our nation's hungry.
- And the winner is...
- So many are... cold, shivering in the night.
I say take those cats and skin them.
Use their fur to keep hundreds warm.
Jesus, Phil!
And the winner is...
Give me that!
- Not one move.
- That barrel's cold.
It's room temperature.
It's OK.
It's not the bomb.
- Silver hair.
- About 6'2".
Looked like Phil Donahue.
- That's the guy!
- Get him!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome internationally renowned singing star, Pia Zadora.
There he is!
Stop him.
Excuse me.
Isn't that snot on your shoe?
I'll stay here.
You check the wings.
Oh, no!
Not him again?
Please, God.
Grab him!
I'm Ed Hocken.
This is Officer Nordberg.
- We're here to prevent a disaster.
- You're too late.
Come on, Nordberg.
We've got to get Frank.
I knew I'd bump into you.
I want answers, cherry cakes.
- I love you.
- Wrong answer.
I dropped out of the sap of the month club.
Listen, you've got one last chance.
And I don't mean a major league baseball Steve Howe last chance.
- Where is Jane?
- I don't know.
- Where's the bomb?
- In the Best Picture envelope.
Oh, Mr Drebin, I want to go straight.
I'm tired of the lies.
Oh, kiss me.
Please kiss me.
I've never kissed lips so innocent, so pure...
He looked like Phil Donahue, white hair...
- That's the guy!
- I'll get him.
Ladies and gentlemen, to present the Best Picture award, two most distinguished actors, Olympia Dukakis and James Earl Jones.
Lord, what's that?
Looks like Phil Donahue throwing up in a tuba.
I don't think we should have Phil Donahue back next year.
Thank you.
Good evening.
It's a privilege for us to present the final award...
We've been worried about you.
Where's Rocco?
Where's Tanya?
- Sit down.
Take it easy.
- Thank God you're all right.
"Indecent Instincts" and "Sawdust And Mildew".
Every one of these movies was a box office hit, except for one.
- What's that?
- The Best Picture award.
My money's on "Sawdust And Mildew".
Olympia, would you do the honours?
Oh, my God!
That's the one!
The award for this year's Best Picture goes to...
Wait!
Sorry about this.
Loved you in "Coneheads".
You, too.
Let me open this.
It's the bomb!
Freeze and nobody gets hurt!
Well... from now on.
Back in your seats, you little weasels!
This program's been interrupted.
Don't panic.
Stay with it.
Camera 2, move in on the old lady.
Better move back.
- Don't move!
- Now, pay attention!
I don't want to kill nobody unless I have to.
Drop your guns and kick 'em over here.
That bomb belongs to me.
Hand it over, Drebin.
You want to kill him, Ma?
Blink and I start shooting.
Give me that gun!
- Oh, my God!
- I'm not falling for that, sister.
She's a goner, Rocco.
Dead.
Then that's it.
I'm coming with you, Ma!
Pull out the bomb or I'll shoot the dame.
All right.
I'll do what you say.
Don't harm her.
You pull out the bomb and you'll kill me anyway.
- Yeah.
No dice!
- Then I'll plug her.
- Shoot her, I'll empty the envelope.
- Frank, think about it.
It's all right.
You'll be dead.
Then you'll kill everyone here.
Yeah.
I'll shoot if you don't do as I say.
I'd be safe, so would everyone else.
- But you'd be dead.
- This is complicated, Rocco.
Logically, you're psychotic, so you have the envelope, I'll have the gun.
I know what I'm doing.
All right!
Here's your Best Picture!
In front of the world, this place is going up.
Well, if I'm going out, I'm going out happy.
Wait.
Before we're all blown up, can I get my underwear out of my crack?
- I got to go comfortable.
- OK, but that's it.
- Give it up, Rocco.
You're history.
- Look, George Hamilton!
Come and get me, Drebin!
Throw me a gun!
Get rid of the bomb!
Hold on, sweetheart.
Frank, help!
I know what I'm doing.
I hate heights!
Move it, sister!
Screw the commercials!
All right, copper, you killed my ma!
I'm taking the dame away from you.
You hear me, copper?
One push and Mrs Drebin is linoleum.
Get a camera up there.
This could be my best work.
Any last words before I throw you off?
- Yes.
Don't do it.
- Anything else?
Frank, I love you.
I want the world to know you're the perfect man.
Frank, I hope you can hear me.
They said I couldn't do drama.
I was wrong.
Taking you away from Police Squad was a mistake.
I know now that's why you couldn't perform decent sex.
I realise that now, and other things.
Everything's under control.
Nobody move!
Any vibration may set this thing off.
Frank, I've learned my lesson.
And though it may be too late for me,
I want all you ladies to remember something.
Don't ever take your men for granted, because good men don't just fall out of the sky.
He's caught up in the cable!
Do something!
I'm coming, Ma!
Papshmir?
- I never want us to be apart again.
- Oh, Frank!
You like me.
You really like me!
- Frank, slow down!
- Hurry up!
Relax.
There's time.
- You got the camcorder?
- Here.
Which room?
Delivery room.
This must be it.
Jane, I'm here.
Frank is here.
Push!
Here it comes now.
Breathe, honey.
Breathe, Jane.
One more push.
That's it.
Congratulations, Dad.
It's a boy!
You come back here!
- Frank, it's a boy.
- I know!
Hey, look!
It's the President!
And the Pope!
Oh, my God!
Look!
It's disgruntled postal workers.
Wait a minute!
Give me my baby back!
- Are you all right?
- I'm soaking wet.
- I'll get the talcum powder.
- It's not that.
I had a nightmare.
Crime all around me, I couldn't stop it.
- Frank, it was just a dream.
- You're right.
All I need is a good night's rest.
Tomorrow everything will be fine.
How's my little boy?
Getting along OK, sweetie?
As well as a heterosexual can in prison.
I don't know if I can take it any longer.
- How's Tanya?
- Tanya's the same.
Milky, creamy skin, pouting red lips, firm buttocks, ample breasts, ears you'd love to stick your tongue into...
- I'll get guy cramps if you keep this up.
- Sorry.
There's somebody here to see you.
Pahpshmir!
- My people are very upset.
- Of course, they're Arab terrorists.
You're supposed to be the world's best terrorist bomber.
- Train stations, government buildings.
- The devastation in South Florida.
- That was Hurricane Andrew.
- That's what they told the public.
We wanted to embarrass the USA.
You've made the police look like heroes.
I told you.
A first-class job would cost five million.
If you want to step up the price,
I got a target that'll make City Hall look like chicken feed.
A big target.
Why should anything be different?
Because five million dollars buys me!
I'm breaking out of here.
If you fail this time, Mr. Dillon, my people won't be so forgiving.
Fail?
Show me one man who can stop me.
Attention shoppers, be sure to check out our special on paper towels.
That's aisle seven.
Hey!
- Give it to me!
- My purse!
Somebody help me!
- Let go of the purse, lady!
- Help me!
For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow which nobody can deny.
Well, we shot a lot of people together.
It's been great.
Today I retire.
If I do any shooting now, it'll have to be in my own home.
Hopefully, it'll be an intruder and not an in-law like at my bachelor party.
Ed, I officially give you my gun and my badge.
And...
Jane and I would like to keep the handcuffs as a souvenir.
Cheer up, Ed.
This is not goodbye.
This is just "I won't ever see you again".
- Somebody help me!
- Out of my way!
- Lt. Drebin!
Frank!
Didn't you see that?
- What?
Oh...
Yes, kitty litter.
Two bags for a dollar.
Great!
Order.
The jury will disregard that last statement.
Continue, counselor.
- The alimony had been set by the court.
- Yes, but...
You haven't paid alimony in two years, repeatedly defying a court order.
- Isn't that right, Mr. Clayton?
- I'd lost her address.
She moved twice.
Don't lie to me.
You're under oath.
Do you know what the penalty for perjury is?
- I'll ask you that again.
- Objection!
Your Honor, I...
Ow, ow, gee.
- Counsel is leading the witness.
- Sustained!
Mommy said no pounding when she's in session.
Read the prosecution's last statement.
"Don't lie to me, Mr. Clayton.
You're under oath." Good boy.
"Do you know what the penalty for perjury is?"
That's all I have, Your Honor.
You may continue, Ms Spencer-Drebin.
Prosecution rests.
Defense Attorney Ms Davies-Jacobs-Steiner-Lazlo.
No further questions.
Court will recess until after the morning feeding.
- We can win this.
I can feel it.
- Yes, of course.
- I married the wrong man.
- I never thought that was possible.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, nothing.
Louise, there's no such thing as the wrong man.
You just have to work at it.
Now, let's see.
Mr. and Mrs. Drebin, right?
Now, you two have been married for six months?
Yes.
We really appreciate you seeing us, Doctor.
Our last therapist recommended you.
Yes, I was sorry to hear about his suicide.
A couple need to get off on the right foot and not get caught up in blame.
- Now, which one of you is impotent?
- That would be him.
Yes, of course.
- Why don't you ask who's frigid?
- That would be him.
- How would you know?
- He resents that I'm a working woman.
He has no idea what a woman wants or needs.
- You're so insensitive.
- Is this that toilet seat thing?
I want to have a baby.
Every time we make love, you have a headache.
I'm not a piece of meat.
I'm trying!
I've got ointments, lotions, creams, books, things that vibrate...
- Frank!
- Maybe it's your fault.
Have you tried sexy lingerie?
Lacy underwear?
A black teddy?
- I've tried them all.
They don't work.
- Oh!
Why don't you want a child?
Didn't I try to adopt that 18-year old Korean girl?
Jane, Frank, here's what I suggest.
Make tonight a special night.
Dinner, wine, romantic music.
Put on the 24-hour Johnny Mathis station.
Just be Jane and Frank.
Lovers!
We haven't had a night like that in a long time.
- Not together.
- Frank!
Jane, having a baby is a big responsibility.
Like being in charge of sanitation at a Haitian jail.
I'm just frightened.
Let's make tonight something special.
Oh, honey, it's just that I love you so much.
My little lover sparrow.
My puppy wuppy wuvver.
My little love biscuit.
- My little snookie wookums.
- My little lady cheesy puffy.
Mr. and Mrs. Drebin, please, I'm a diabetic.
I think you ought to go now.
- I never thought we'd end this way.
- How did you think we'd end?
I don't know.
Some other way.
Oh, Jason, please...
Bobbi...
- I've been hurt before.
- We have to fight this thing together.
Ed, Nordberg!
It's been a long time!
- Good to see you, buddy.
- You look terrific.
I'm taking a step class, and I got a thigh master for Christmas.
Where are my manners?
Come on in!
- How charming!
- Sit, sit.
Excuse the mess.
It's my ironing day.
I've just frosted some cupcakes.
- Would you care for one?
- Not now.
We're having trouble with a terrorist threat.
- Police Squad is certain that...
- I'd love a cupcake.
- That coffee smells great.
- I grind my own beans.
We're here because we need your help with something.
- They're great!
- I'd hoped you'd like them.
Made from scratch.
I'll just get off my feet.
We may have a lead on a suspect in the City Hall bombing attempt.
These were taken by a photographer.
- She was used as a diversion.
- We've had them enlarged.
- They look familiar.
- No, Frank, the pin.
She's a nurse.
Can I keep this one?
We traced her to the Karlson Clinic on Myrtlewood.
Her name is Tanya Peters.
- Do you know her?
- Don't you remember back in the 70s?
The big disco shoot out.
Hey, Ed.
What's happening, my man?
We missed you last night at the fondue party.
Couldn't make it.
I saw the Village People.
They're gas.
- Far out, I can dig it!
- What's this?
One dead disco dancer.
- Bummer!
What a mind bender.
- We think it was a love triangle.
This is the suspect's girlfriend, Tanya Peters.
- Cigarette?
- Yes, I know.
We'll need a statement from you down at the station.
- Nordberg!
- Coming, lieutenant!
I do remember!
You were one of the first test cases for minoxidol.
- What?
- I'm glad I could be of help.
If you don't mind, I've got a rump of lamb to roast.
- We need a favor.
- It's not that big a rump roast.
It's not that.
We need you to go undercover at the clinic.
I've quit police work.
You're whistling up the wrong neck of the woods.
I wouldn't ask, but we're in a bind.
- What about Hedges and O'Malley?
- They're in Hawaii... together.
I can't.
Jane and I have a special evening planned.
It'll only take a few hours.
Still time to make dinner.
I don't know.
I'll have to make pork chops.
Think of all the crime.
Nobody is safe.
You'd be protecting Jane.
You'd be protecting all the Janes of the world.
- You haven't shot anybody in 6 months.
- That's true.
Funny how you miss the little things.
Might be good to feel cold steel against my thigh again.
The thrill of a chase... to be a man!
After folding the laundry, I set out for the clinic.
Police operations require a foolproof disguise.
This operation was no different.
I had no idea if Tanya would recognize me, so I wore fake glasses.
I combed my hair differently, just in case.
I planned to get in and find out about Tanya's connection with the bombing, and get out as quickly as possible.
I figured faking an old football injury would do the trick.
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see a doctor.
Sign in here, please.
Do you have an appointment, Mr?
Smith.
No, I don't.
- Then take a number.
- Six.
- What?
- Is six taken?
Does it have to be between one and ten?
- You'll be called.
- Thank you.
Mr. Smith?
We've had a cancellation.
We can take you now.
Dr. Kohlzak?
Good morning, Mr. Smith.
Right this way.
I appreciate you seeing me.
I'm sure it won't take too long.
- When did you first notice the problem?
- In the back yard with my uncle.
- In the back yard?
With your uncle?
- Yes, when he visits we like to go out in the back yard and throw it around.
What did you and your uncle find out?
I can't keep up with him.
Mine hurt, especially on the long ones.
I can't seem to straighten it out.
It has no feeling.
It's kind of numb.
I may have yanked it too much, maybe.
- If you would...
- For what?
- A sperm count.
- In here?
It's not exactly the back yard, but it will do.
Well...
Follow me, and we'll do the necessary paperwork.
Sign these at the bottom, and leave them with the nurse.
- This way, please.
- What?
- Number 17.
- A problem?
- No.
- This is 17.
You're next.
- Have we met before?
- If you excuse me, I'm next.
Sir...
Mr. Smith, how are we doing?
I've been busy, if that's what you mean.
Would you like a video tape to assist you?
Do you have "Dances With Wolves"?
"Rocketeer"? "Lady And The Tramp"?
An adult movie.
The tape was very entertaining.
Follow me.
Do you have "Spartacus"?
Maintenance, clean up Room 7.
Maintenance, clean up Room 7.
Stat.
- What are you doing?
- Freshening up.
You should always look your best, even by yourself.
Are you sure we've never met?
Oh, here's my cup.
Back to work.
Mr. Smith, are you OK in there?
I could use a little help.
Dr. Rosenblatt, foreplay in Room 7, please.
Honey, I've been waiting all day.
I'm wearing the nightgown you bought me for our honeymoon.
Tonight's gonna be special.
I'll make love to you for hours and hours.
Wouldn't Mr. Happy like that?
- Hours?
- Like our first time together.
Why don't I get ready and soak in the tub for a couple of days?
Possibly a week.
So cute!
Let me go and get the oysters and clams.
Here.
I'll shave your back like last time.
Jane, I really don't think we should.
- Frank, what's this?
!
- I fell... on a rake.
You're lying.
Now I know why Ed's been calling.
- You've been back on the case.
- No, I swear.
It's another woman.
In your wildest dreams!
It's bad enough you won't have a baby.
I warned you against working again.
You white Anglo male!
Jane, it was nothing.
I was only doing Ed a small favor.
Some retirement!
I'm leaving.
I never thought you'd go back on your word.
- Aren't you being a little hasty?
- I don't think so.
That's the cab.
You can reach me at Louise's.
How could you?
We need some time apart to think about us.
I'm not going to think.
Why now?
I love you.
Look, I am what I am, and I do what I do.
Some make shoelaces, some make a living neutering animals.
- I am a cop.
- Pretty speech.
My mind is made up, I'm leaving!
All right, then take this with you.
I guess you know how my lips feel about things.
Goodbye, Frank.
Your listening to K.S.A.D. All depressing, all the time.
Here's a dedication to Frank from Jane calling from a taxi.
You not only shoot blanks, you leave the door open, letting the heat out.
Were you born in a barn?
He wouldn't do any more police work.
Once a cop, always a cop.
- He's married to his work, not me.
- You'll come second.
There's an article in Cosmo, "Why All Men Are Pigs".
Read it!
Frank's just another word for "loser".
I never want to see him again.
I want to get far away from here.
We'll go to my friend's cabin.
The fresh air will do you good.
Go easy!
That's your second bottle of Chanel.
This is the beginning of a new Jane Spencer-Drebin.
No more Miss Perky who devoted her life to one man.
I'm out for the new me.
Let's burn rubber!
- Have you forgotten anything?
- I hope not.
Calm down.
How many bodies did you find in your pool?
In this state killing a gang member is only an $18 fine.
- Frank!
Glad you could make it.
- Welcome, buddy.
- Nordberg, Ed.
- Did you find Tanya's address?
I wrote it down on a hanky, and I can't remember what I did with it.
- I'm getting rusty.
- That could happen to anybody.
I brought you some of "Frank's Never Fail Fudge".
- Go on about your business.
- Smells great.
- I'll stay out of your hair.
- It'll be just like...
Frank, let me get that.
We have a surprise for you.
In honor of your 30 years on the force.
Nordberg!
Oh, boy.
This is really great.
Thank you, guys.
It might cheer you up.
We heard about you and Jane.
Jane, Jane...
The name will always remind me of her.
I feel bad about this.
If there's anything you need?
- Like Dr. Kevorkian's home number.
- Nordberg, put it together!
- We're here for you.
- Thanks.
- Look who's here.
Nice to see you.
- Ted.
- I have data for you on the bomb.
- What did you find out?
- The explosive is a very fine powder.
- It tastes like...
That's fertilizer.
It's for another case.
This is what I'm talking about.
- We detected nitroglycerine.
- Can you tell us where it came from?
I'd be glad to.
Billions of years ago, the earth was a molten mass...
- I mean the powder.
- We have no clue.
Let me take that urine, Frank.
We found a list of the bomber's plans at the scene.
- We analyzed the paper.
- And?
The paper is from Statesville Prison.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
The wood is from the rare Canary Island Pine.
It only grows in Oregon.
Contacting paper mills led us to a distribution center in Tacoma.
There the trail ended.
- How did you trace it to Statesville?
- The letterhead.
We compared the handwriting of all bombers serving in Statesville and found a suspect, Rocco Dillon.
He's masterminding the bombings from the prison.
If so, there's only one way to find out where Rocco'll strike next.
- We'll have to send someone in prison.
- I'll do it.
I wouldn't feel right about that.
If Rocco finds out, you might end up dead.
"You might end up dead" is my middle name.
- What about Jane?
- I don't know hers.
I need the action.
I'm going inside the big house.
Frank, Ed, you might want to see this.
We're testing a prototype for a new anti-carjacking device.
You'll get to see how it works.
- Get out!
- No.
Don't make me use...
"The Denver Jockstrap".
After being retired for six months, I was back in action.
Faster than you say "Spread 'em!", I was inside Statesville Prison.
I was surrounded by pimps, rapists and murderers.
It was like being in the stands of an LA Raiders' game.
It was going to take all my police experience just to stay alive in here.
After a long and generous cavity search, I reached my destination:
Maximum security, home of some of the country's most violent sociopaths.
And the worst of them all, Rocco Dillon.
All right, in here.
Ain't no prison yet could hold me.
Attica!
Attica!
Power to the brothers.
Kill whitey, kill whitey!
Knock it off!
You're chirping loud for a new canary.
Keep flashing your eyes, and I'll balance your jaw.
Hey!
You know who you're talking to?
The man is Rocco Dillon.
- Where's your prison number?
- It's unlisted.
Just call me Nick "The Slasher" Magirk.
Look, ham head.
I'm the muscle in this pen.
Stay out of my way.
Just watch your step, Magirk.
Take it from me, this place changes a man.
- Oh, yeah, in what way?
- I used to be white.
I was the drummer for the Osmonds.
Screw with me, he'll make you feel pain you've never felt before.
I know, I remember the Osmonds.
- Better hit the rack, Magirk.
- In a minute.
First I'll make a list of the people I'm gonna kill in the next few days.
Lights out!
Lock down in two minutes!
My dearest snookie wookums buns,
I miss you so much.
I haven't felt this bad since... the last time I was dumped.
I remember it well.
Her name was Gabriella.
We were supposed to marry, but on our wedding day, she never showed up.
I was heartbroken, destroyed.
I figured she'd fallen for another man.
Someone who could do to her what I never could.
I thought my life was over until that one glorious day.
That was the day you became my wife.
All our friends celebrated our love.
It seemed like only yesterday.
We were all so overjoyed.
We wished they all could come with us.
That was the happiest day of my life.
I'll never forget the plans we made.
Things were going to be perfect.
We were going to get that housekeeper you always wanted.
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. D.
I knew that eventually our dream would come true.
One day we'd have our own Frank Drebin Jr.
Shut up, Magirk.
I'm trying to sleep.
It's no use.
She'll never come back.
Bend over and pick it up for me would you, lover?
No problem.
Rocco could tell from my escapade in the shower that I was courageous.
Now, I had to get on the inside.
Like a blind man at an orgy, I would have to feel things out.
Tyrone, I've got the escape plans here.
Just you and me.
- Burnett wants in, too.
- He's a guard!
- I know, but he's unhappy here.
- All right, whatever.
Got it all worked out right here.
What's this?
Another letter from your mommy?
- That's private, screw.
- Let's have a look.
- Give him back his letter.
- Buzz off, butter cheeks.
What's so special about a little letter?
Wait a minute... an escape plan!
This is your ticket to another 20 years.
If the Warden gets one look...
You call this slop?
Real slop has got chunks of things in it.
This is more like gruel!
This Chateau LeBlanc '68 is supposed to be served slightly chilled.
This is room temperature.
- What do you think we are?
Animals?
- No!
What are we?
Homo sapiens?
You're right!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
No, no.
Stop!
Right hand red, left hand blue.
Who's got a hand in my pocket?
Come on, son.
You can do it.
Eat some beans.
You saved my bacon.
I'd be in solitary if you hadn't done that.
You've been handling yourself really good.
- Really well.
- Whatever.
I've got something big coming up.
I could have use for you.
You've got a dental plan?
What's the caper?
We've got to bust out of this playpen.
Thanks to you, we have an escape plan.
- It's a good plan.
- I've had better.
Listen, I've got a foolproof plan.
They've got Tyrone.
Can't we all just get along?
Now that Tyrone was in solitary, it was just me and Rocco.
He had no choice but to trust me...
Shh!
Hold on!
Anyway, I convinced Rocco to dig a tunnel.
It was either that or the laundry truck.
The thought of lying nose down in underwear with skid marks didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.
Disposing of the dirt was a problem I solved early.
Outside of some major chaffing, we made good progress.
We kept digging, and dummies gave the impression we were in our cell.
Lights out, Magirk.
There was more dirt than I anticipated.
Disposing of it was tricky.
Safe!
Where are you going?
Are you thinking of Frank again?
- They are playing our song.
- I understand.
Take your time.
- Hello, there.
- Excuse me.
I'm hauling a load of rice cakes to Big D.
- Why don't you come?
- No.
- How about a kiss?
- No!
I know women mean "yes" when they say "no".
How about that kiss?
- Yes.
- What do you mean "no"?
Come on, baby, we're two of a kind.
- You killed him!
- It was an accident.
Call the police.
Come to your senses.
You killed a man.
You're a hero to all American women!
Call Frank.
He'll protect us.
He's a man.
He'll lock you away for life.
I wanna help you kill as many men as possible.
Do what you have to do.
I'm calling Frank.
Be home, Frank, please.
Answer the phone, snuggle pants.
Frank!
- Hi, this is Frank.
- And Jane.
We're the Drebins.
We're not home right now.
Leave a message.
- Which button do I press?
- Not that one.
Tanya?
It was another woman.
Frank was telling the truth.
Honeymoon Bay Road, I bet they're there right now.
Oh, Frank!
Cell inspection!
There's been a rumor of a possible break-out.
If we suspect anyone of attempting to escape, they will be punished severely.
Once word of the escape was out, we had to move for the tunnel.
The last few feet had to be dug on the run.
We were sure that another 47 yards would take us beyond the prison walls.
May he rest in peace in the arms of our loving...
Jesus Christ!
Amen.
Rocco had arranged for a getaway car to meet us.
After adjusting our direction, we arrived at the rendezvous point a Los Angeles city high school.
Hey, that was close.
Hey, Rocco, who's the old hag?
- She take one in the face?
- She's my mother!
Mrs. Dillon, your son is a ruthless, sadistic, cold-blooded animal.
- You must be very proud of him.
- I am.
Ma, I want you to meet a real square egg, Nick "The Slasher" Magirk.
There are fresh clothes in the back.
Rocco's mother was quiet.
I sensed she didn't like me coming along.
Like a midget at a urinal, I would have to stay on my toes.
Hey!
Stop!
Oh, Frank!
It wasn't my fault.
That cow shouldn't have been on the road.
Hurry up, you're letting the flies in!
- What do you think, kid?
- Sweet setup.
No phones.
Miles from the nearest town.
Playboy Channel.
Perfect.
Nice digs, but I'm here for the action.
Are we taking banks or armored cars?
- You're getting too nosy, Magirk.
- Relax, Ma.
- She's been itching to try this gun.
- I know the feeling.
It was Tanya.
That bathing suit was never happier.
I had only a second to admire the view.
I had to watch out.
If she made me as a cop, I'd be tonight's meat loaf.
- Come here, sexy.
- You're all woman.
I can tell.
Hey, she's referring to me.
I was talking about your mother.
That's no way to be walking around.
Get clothes on.
And what are you doing in my bathing suit?
- Hey, who's the stud?
- Meet our newest gang member.
Slasher Magirk, meet Tanya Peters.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
I smelt cop the minute I saw him.
I get that all the time.
The underwear ads.
Are you saying you're not a cop?
Well, yeah.
- That's good enough for me.
- I'm fine.
I'm glad that's all cleared up.
Ma, why don't you two kiss and make up?
Well, all right.
That's more like it.
I had to get a message to the squad.
This was more than I could handle by myself.
No phone and miles from people, I was worse off than a gerbil in a bath house.
Who's there?
Slasher, have you seen my pigeon?
Pigeon?
What pigeon?
- What are you doing?
- I'm just contemplating my next move.
Your bishop is exposed.
It's these pants.
I usually wear a fuller cut.
You're all man.
I like that in my men.
You're coming on to me big time, purring like a kitten with a mouse.
- But we got a problem.
- You're Jewish?
No.
You're Rocco's girl.
In my book that chapter is called "Look, But Don't Touch".
I could have two lovers.
Kinky.
But I like my sex the way I play basketball, one on one and with as little dribbling as possible.
You're tense, Slasher.
I could relax more, if I knew what was on tomorrow.
Do you know anything about that?
All I know is that it's downtown and... big.
That's the way I like it.
What else?
Just this...
- What are you doing?
- Thank you for the advice.
- I'll try that recipe out, Ms Peters.
- How could you?
You shove your tongue as far down as you can.
Quiet.
You're not supposed to know me here.
That's a goodbye kiss, sister.
- What's this?
Who's the skirt?
- Just some dizzy dame.
Her car broke down.
I'll take her to the bus.
Look, she's married.
What if her husband comes here?
- He will.
He must be great.
- He breaks promises.
And you traipse all over to spite a wonderful guy.
- He left me.
- You left him.
- You should talk!
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you!
- Listen to you!
You two, knock it off!
You'd think you were married.
- What do you want to do with her?
- One thing is for sure there's no room for her here.
- I say we bump her off.
- Let's plug her.
- No.
I was on a job that went hooey.
I'd have given my eyeteeth for a hostage.
Women make the best ones.
They are smaller, easy to take along, eat less, smell nice.
Yeah, we got us an insurance policy.
Good thinking, kid.
Come on, let's get some shut-eye.
We got a big day ahead of us.
It's rigged.
Keep your eye on the tower.
- It's what's going to happen tonight.
- Aren't we awfully far away?
On the top of that tower is a device that's going to net us five million bucks.
A thing I've been working on.
We'll detonate it this evening at an event the whole world will be watching.
- Your crowning achievement.
- It's for both of us, Ma.
- All set?
- Set.
Very impressive.
Cool.
Cool.
America will be brought to its knees by this terrorist act.
It'll be more embarrassing to the US than Tonya Harding.
We're there.
Give my regards to Mrs. Gaddafi.
And tell her thanks for the cookies.
It's another beautiful night in LA, and the stars are shining bright for the 66th annual Academy Awards.
Fans are clamoring to see their favorite celebrities.
Here are two, "Weird Al" Yankovic and Vanna White.
Slasher, put the dame in the trunk.
I'll meet you and Ma around the back in ten minutes.
Got the passes?
- We pull this up, it's 5 million big ones.
- Not bad, Ma.
- What's going to happen to me?
- I have an idea.
- Slasher, you know what to do.
- Right.
Check the spare tire and all fluid levels.
No, keep an eye on the dame.
We hit trouble, she's a bullet shield.
Ladies and gentlemen, to present the Academy's Lifetime Achievement...
Ready, 3.
Roll tape.
Go to clip.
Aspirin, please.
Go to 3.
Ready, 4.
This year's Lifetime Achievement Award winner's credits include great films.
"Sandals and Loincloth", 1958.
"Sweaty Boatmen", 1959.
"The Leather Clad Centurion", 1960, and his first color feature in 1966, "Big Shiny Spears".
There's the man from Bryce/Porterhouse.
He guards the envelopes until they're handed out.
He won't budge from there.
Distract him so I can plant the bomb in an envelope.
Accepting the award for Mr. Bronkowitz is Margaret Red Feather.
That ought to do it.
You'll pay for this.
Rocco'll kill you whoever you are.
- Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Isn't that a little unusual?
- It happened to me.
Here's the plan.
- You'll never stop Rocco.
- Your chances are one in a million.
- Better than any state lottery.
I'm the good guy.
I can't let the bad guys win.
Our children can't be raised in fear.
If we can't stop them, they'll blow that place up.
It'll be a tragedy, unless it happens during a dance number.
Come on.
Does that radio work?
Call Police Squad.
Tell them Frank Drebin...
Forget it.
I wonder what the devil he wanted?
- Hold on.
- Sergeant Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Yeah, and I'm Robert De Niro.
- Mr. De Niro, we've got to get inside.
You and 10,000 other people.
Move along.
Movie stars only.
Come on.
I've got a better idea.
And cue talent.
To present the award for Best Supporting Actress Mariel Hemingway and Elliot Gould.

Thank you, sheriff.
Still no word of Frank or Rocco's gang.
I'm worried.
He should've phoned in.
Let me check your tickets.
Lovely gown.

OK, enjoy the show.
Let's see.
Vanna White and "Weird Al" Yankovic.

Yes.
Florence Henderson'll win.
It's about time.
- No, the bomb is in an envelope.
- You're right!
And the winner is Mary Lou Retton for "Fatal Affair".
I'm sorry, we were rooting for Florence Henderson.
We've got to get to the envelopes.
- So many.
- They added 75 categories.
"Best Actor in a Columbus movie"?
Best Director is presented by star of stage and screen Raquel Welch and host of his own award-winning talk show Phil Donahue.
That might be the envelope for the bomb.
Keep looking here.
One more second, Mr. Donahue.
Oh, my God!
Look at Donahue.
Stop the stairs, Joey.
Joey!
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to present the...
What the hell?
!
- Jesus!
- Go to commercial.
Easy now.
Talk to me.
What happened, Ma?
Slasher is Frank Drebin of Police Squad.
Lousy, two-bit copper!
I treated him like my brother... the one I didn't kill.
- He might find the bomb.
- Not if I find him first.
- Back from commercial in 5 seconds.
- Hurry up with the mike.
Cue Donahue.
Read it.
Read the card, moron.
"Well, Raquel, this certainly is a special evening.
Phew!"
"I can barely catch my breath.
Turn it over to Raquel."
"Raquel:
I'm used to being out of breath, working out to my..."
What's he doing?
!
"Hold for laughter.
To Phil.
Gets me out of breath just watching you."
- "To Raquel.
Oh, Phil..."
- I'm supposed to read that.
"Let's get to the subject at hand.
Pick up the envelope..."
The nominees for best director are:
Sir Richard Attenborough for his musical based on the life of Mother Teresa, "Mother".
Food, I love food and I'm really in the mood for a big corn dog of pooh-pooh platter two ding-dongs, it doesn't matter and some tuna helper, I'll be racing back for more
But don't get any sausage 'cause I'll blow chunks on the floor
Spike Lee, "X II
- The Merchandising"
Nordberg, look.
That's Frank at the Academy Awards.
How did he get tickets?
That's where Rocco Dillon is going to strike next, the Academy Awards.
- We have to get there.
- We're not invited.
We're cops.
- It's for you.
- Nordberg, Police Squad.
Hello.
Hello.
Henderson, see about this phone.
I think it's broke.
And now, here are today's lucky lotto numbers.
Get your tickets ready because here they come: 12, 22, 18 and 9.
And for his tale of genetics gone haywire in a retirement community,
Steven Spielberg, "Geriatric Park".
And the winner is...
- Raquel, just a second.
- Now what?
- I just had a thought.
- Oh, Christ.
This show is being seen all over the world, I was thinking if we could all send good thoughts through these cameras to men like the leader of China, Wing Wa Woo Tong, so that they might finally be nice.
Thank you.
And the winner is...
Raquel, so many go to bed hungry in this nation, yet cat food is full of tuna.
Each time I go to the zoo and see those porpoises crammed into tiny tanks,
I think, "What a waste that is."
Butcher half of them now!
That's a lot of dolphin meat that can be fed to our cats, freeing up that tuna for our nation's hungry.
- And the winner is...
- So many are cold, shivering in the night.
So I say, "Take those cats, skin them."
- "Use their fur to keep hundreds warm."
- Jesus, Phil.
And the winner is...
- You!
- Give me that!
- Not one move.
- That barrel's cold.
It's OK.
It's not the bomb.
- Jane.
Jane!
- Big trouble!
Jane.
Silver hair.
Kind of looked like Phil Donahue.
That's the guy!
Please welcome internationally renowned actress and singing star
Pia Zadora.
- Excuse me, is that snot on your shoe?
- Snot?
Where?
Oh, no.
Not him again.
Please, God.
Get off the stage!
Ed Hocken and Nordberg from Police Squad.
- We're here to prevent a disaster.
- Too late for that.
It's Frank.
Come on, Nordberg.
We've got to get to Frank.
Jane!
Jane!
I knew I'd bump into you somewhere.
I want answers, cherry cakes.
- I love you.
- Wrong answer.
I quit the Sap-of-the-Month Club long ago.
Angel drawers, you've got one last chance.
Not one of those Major-League- Baseball-Steve-Howe last chances.
- Where is Jane?
- I swear I don't know.
- Where is the bomb?
- In the Best Picture envelope.
Oh, Mr. Drebin, I want to go straight.
I'm tired of the lies.
Oh, kiss me.
Please, kiss me.
I've never kissed lips so innocent, so pure.
He looked like Phil Donahue.
White hair.
That's the guy.
To present the Best Picture Award are two very distinguished actors.
Olympia Dukakis and James Earl Jones.
- Oh, Lord.
What's that?
- Phil Donahue throwing up in a tuba.
Make a note about not having Phil Donahue back next year.
Thank you.
Good evening.
It's a privilege to present the final award of tonight's ceremony.
We've been worried about you.
Where's Rocco and Tanya?
- Sit down.
Take it easy.
- Thank God you're all right.
"Indecent Instincts" and "Sawdust and Mildew".
Oddly enough, all these movies are box office hits, except one.
- What's that?
- It's the Best Picture Award.
Olympia, would you do the honors?
Oh, my God.
That's the one!
The award for this year's best picture goes to...
- Wait!
- Oh, great.
Sorry.
Loved you in "Coneheads".
You, too.
Let me open this.
It's the bomb!
Freeze, and nobody gets hurt!
Well, from now on.
Take your seats, the party's over!
This programme's been stopped.
OK, don't panic.
Camera 2, move in on the old lady.
Better move back, 2.
- I said, "Nobody moves."
- Sit down and pay attention!
I don't want to kill anybody unless I have to.
Drop your guns and kick them over here.
I believe that bomb belongs to me.
Hand it over, Drebin.
You want to do the honors of killing him, Ma?
Blink, and I start shooting.
Give me that gun.
- Oh, my God!
- I'm not falling for that one, sister.
- Ma!
- She's a goner, Rocco.
Dead?
Then that's it.
I'm coming with you, Ma!
- Pull out the bomb, or I'll shoot her.
- All right, Rocco.
All right.
I'll do what you say.
Just don't harm her.
You pull out the bomb, you'll kill me and everyone else.
- No dice, Rocco.
- Then I'll plug her.
- If you do, I'll empty this envelope.
- Frank, think about it.
- It's all right, you'll be dead.
- You'll kill yourself and everyone here.
- Yeah.
- I'll shoot you if you don't do as I say.
- Jane?
- I'd be safe.
So would everyone else.
- But you'd be dead.
- This is getting a little complicated.
Let's be logical.
You're the psycho, you should have this and I the gun.
I know what I'm doing.
All right.
Here's your Best Picture, in front of a worldwide audience.
- This place is going up.
- If I'm going out, I'm going out happy.
Wait, Rocco, before we're all blown to bits.
Mind if I pull the underwear out of my crack?
A man's got to go comfortable.
All right, but that's it.
- Give it up, Rocco, you're history!
- Look, George Hamilton!
Come and get me.
Throw me a gun.
Get rid of the bomb.
Hold on.
Frank, help me!
- Frank!
- I know what I'm doing.
I hate heights.
Move it.
Screw the commercials!
All right, copper.
You killed my ma.
I'm taking the dame away from you.
You hear me, copper?
One push and Mrs. Drebin is linoleum.
Get a camera up there.
This could be my best work!
- Any last words before I throw you off?
- Yes, don't do it.
- Anything else?
- Frank, I love you.
I want the world to know you're the perfect man.
- Frank, I hope you can hear me.
- They told me I couldn't do drama.
I was wrong to take you away from Police Squad.
I know now that's why you couldn't perform sexually.
I realize that and a lot of other things now.
Everything's under control.
Nobody moves!
Any vibration might set this thing off.
Frank, I've learned my lesson.
Even though it may be too late for me, I want all ladies out there to remember:
Don't ever take your men for granted.
Good men don't just fall out of the sky.
He's caught up in the cable.
Frank, do something.
Hurry.
I'm coming, Ma!
- Rocco?
- Pahpshmir?
Jane, I never want us to be apart again.
Oh, Frank, you like me, you really like me.
- Frank, slow down.
- Hurry up, we're late!
- Relax.
Did you bring the camcorder?
- Right here.
- What room is she in?
- Delivery room.
This must be it.
Jane, I'm here.
Frank is here now.
- Push!
Bear down now.
- Breathe, honey.
One more push.
That's it.
Congratulations, Dad.
It's a boy.
Nordberg!
Come back here!
- Frank, it's a boy.
- I know!
Subtitles by demonseye
Hey, look!
It's the President!
And the Pope!
Oh, my God!
Look!
It's disgruntled postal workers.
Wait a minute!
Give me my baby back!
Frank!
- Frank.
Are you all right?
- I'm soaking wet.
- I'll get the talcum powder.
- No, no, it's not that.
I had a nightmare.
It was crime all around me, I couldn't stop it.
- Frank, it was just a dream.
- You're right.
All I need is a good night's rest.
In the morning everything will be just fine.
How's my little boy?
Gettin' along okay, sweetie?
Heh, about as well as a heterosexual can in prison.
I don't know how much longer I can take it in here.
- Ma, how's Tanya?
- Tanya's the same.
Milky, creamy skin, pouting red lips, firm buttocks, ample breasts, ears you'd just love to stick your tongue into...
Ma, please, I'm gonna get guy cramps if you keep this up.
Sorry.
Rocco, there's somebody here to see you.
Pahpshmir!
My people are very upset.
They're always upset, they're Arab terrorists.
Ma, please.
You're supposed to be the foremost terrorist bomber in the world.
Train stations, department stores, government buildings....
The devastation in South Florida?
- That was Hurricane Andrew.
- That's what they told the public.
No matter.
We wanted to embarrass the United States and now you've made the police look like international heroes.
I told you.
A first-class job would cost five million.
Now, if you wanna step up to the price,
I got a target that'll make City Hall look like chicken feed.
That's a pretty big target.
But why should I think anything would be different?
It's five million dollars buys me!
I'm breakin' outta here.
All right.
But fail this time, Mr. Dillon, and my people won't be so forgiving.
Fail?
Show me one man who can stop me.
Attention, shoppers, be sure to check out our special on paper towels on aisle seven.
That's aisle seven.
Hey!
Help!
- Give it to me!
- My purse!
Somebody help me!
- Let go of the purse, lady!
- Help me!
For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow... which nobody can deny.
Well, ugh, we shot a lot of people together.
It's been great.
But today I retire.
So, if I do any shooting now, it'll have to be within the compounds of my own home.
Hopefully, it'll be an intruder and... not an in-law like at my bachelor party.
Well...
Ed, I officially give you my gun...
- and... my... my badge.
- Ohh...
And, uh, uh, Jane and I would like to keep the handcuffs as a souvenir.
Cheer up, Ed.
This is not goodbye.
This is just "I won't ever see you again".
- My God!
Somebody help me!
- Out of my way!
- Lt. Drebin!
Frank!
Didn't you see that?
- What?
Oh, uh...
Yes, kitty litter.
Two bags for a dollar.
Great!
Order in this court.
The jury will disregard that last statement.
You may continue, counselor.
The alimony had been set by the court.
Isn't that right, Mr. Clayton?
Yes, but...
But not once have you paid the alimony to my client in the past two years, repeatedly defying a court order.
Isn't that right, Mr. Clayton?
I'd lost her address.
She moved twice.
I couldn't keep up.
Don't lie to me, Mr. Clayton.
You're under oath.
Do you know what the penalty for perjury is?
- I'll ask you that again.
- Objection!
Your Honor, I...
Ow, ow, gee.
- Counsel is leading the witness.
- Sustained!
Sweetie, mommy said no pounding when she's in session.
Please read the prosecution's last statement to the court.
"Don't lie to me, Mr. Clayton.
You're under oath." There, atta boy.
"Do you know what the penalty for perjury is?"
That's all I have, your Honor.
You may continue, Ms. Spencer-Drebin.
Uhh, prosecution rests.
Defense Attorney Ms. Davies-Jacobs-Steiner-Lazlo.
I have no further questions, your Honor.
Court will recess until after the morning feeding.
- We can win this.
I can feel it.
- Yes, of... of course.
- I married the wrong man.
- I never thought that was possible.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, nothing.
Louise, there's no such thing as the wrong man.
You just have to work at it.
Now, let's see.
Mr. and Mrs. Drebin, right?
Now, you two've been married for six months?
Yes.
We really appreciate you seeing us, doctor.
You came higly recommended by our last therapist.
Yes, I was sorry to hear about his suicide.
You know, I feel it's important for a couple to get off on the right foot, and not get caught up in blame.
- Now, which one of you is... impotent?
- That would be him.
Uh, yes, course.
- Why don't you ask who's frigid?
- That would be him also.
Oh?
How would you know?
You're never home.
He resents the fact that I'm a working woman.
In fact, he has no idea what a woman wants or needs.
- You're so insensitive.
- This isn't that toilet seat thing again, is it?
It's babies, Frank.
I wanna have a baby.
And every time we start to make love, you have a headache.
I'm not a piece of meat, Jane.
I'm trying!
I got ointments, lotions, creams, books, things that vibrate...
- Frank!
- Well, maybe it's your fault.
Have you tried sexy lingerie?
Some lacy underwear?
A black teddy?
I've tried wearing them all.
They don't work.
Oh!
Frank, why don't you wanna have a child?
Didn't I try to adopt that 18-year old Korean girl?
Jane, Frank, here's what I suggest.
Make tonight a special night.
Dinner, wine, romantic music.
Put on the 24-hour Johnny Mathis station.
Just be Jane and Frank...
Lovers!
We haven't had a night like that in... in a long time.
- Not together.
- Frank!
Jane, having a baby is a big responsibility.
It's like being in charge of sanitation at a Haitian jail.
I'm just frightened.
Frank...
Let's make tonight something special.
Oh, honey, it's... just that I love you so much.
My little lover sparrow.
My... puppy wuppy wuvver.
My little love biscuit.
- My little snookie wookums.
- My little lady cheesy puffy.
Mr. and Mrs. Drebin, please, I'm a diabetic.
I think you two ought to go now.
- I never thought we'd end this way.
- How did you think we'd end?
I don't know.
Some other way.
Oh, Jason, please...
Bobbi...
- I've been hurt before.
- We have to fight this thing together.
Ed, Nordberg!
It's been a long time!
- Hiya, Frank.
- Good to see you, buddy.
You look terrific.
Thank you, Ed.
I'm taking a step class, and a little woman got me a thigh master for Christmas.
But, look at me!
Where are my manners?
Come on in!
Come in!
- How charming!
- Hey, sit, sit.
Sit.
Excuse the mess.
It's my ironing day.
I've just frosted some cupcakes.
- Would you care for one?
- Uh, not just now.
Uh, Frank, we're having a little problem with a terrorist threat.
- Police Squad is certain that...
- I'd love a cupcake.
- And that coffee smells great.
- I grind my own beans.
Hey, Frank, the reason we're here is that we need your help with something.
- They're just great!
- I hoped you'd like them.
Made them from scratch.
I'll just get up my feet for a second.
Uh, Frank, we may have a lead on a suspect in the City Hall bombing attempt.
Have a look.
These pictures were taken by a news photographer.
- We think that girl was used as a diversion.
- We had them enlarged.
- They look familiar.
- No, no, Frank, the pin.
She's a nurse.
Oh, right, yeah.
Can I keep this one?
We traced her to the Karlson Clinic on Myrtlewood.
Her name is Tanya Peters.
Tanya Peters?
- You know 'er?
- Don't you remember back in the 1970s?
The big disco shoot out.
Hey, Ed.
What's happening, my man?
Frank.
We missed you last night at the fondue party.
Yeah, couldn't make it.
Went to see the Village People.
They are stone-sold gas, man.
- Far out, I can dig it!
- And what do we got here?
One dead disco dancer.
- Bummer!
What a mind bender, uh?
- We think it was some sort of love triangle.
This is the suspect's girlfriend, Tanya Peters.
I'll be right back.
- Cigarette?
- Yes, I know.
Well, we'll need a statement from you down at the station.
- Nordberg!
- Coming, lieutenant!
I do remember!
You were one of the first test cases for monoxidol, weren't you?
- What?
- Well, I'm glad I could be of help.
If you don't mind, now I got a rump of lamb to put in the oven.
- Frank, we need to ask you a favor.
- Not that big a rump roast, Nordberg.
Uh-ha-ha, it's not that, Frank.
We need you to go undercover at the clinic today.
Hey, whoa, wait a minute.
I've given up police work, Ed.
No, you're whistling up the wrong neck of the woods.
I wouldn't ask, but we're in a bind, Frank.
Oh, what about those two new guys, Hedges and O'Malley?
They're in Hawaii.
Together.
Oh, I-I can't.
Jane and I have a special evening planned.
Frank, it'll only take a couple of hours.
You'll be home in plenty of time to make dinner.
I don't know.
I'll have to make pork chops.
Frank, think of all the crime out there.
Nobody is safe.
You'd be protecting Jane.
You'd be protecting all the Janes of the world.
Besides, you haven't shot anybody in 6 months.
That's true.
Funny how you miss the little things.
Might be good to feel that cold hard steel pressed against my thigh once again.
The thrill of a chase...
To be a man!
After folding the laundry, I set out for the Karlson clinic.
In any police operation it's important to have a foolproof disguise.
And this operation was no different.
I had no idea if Tanya would still recognize me, so I slipped on a fake pair of glasses.
Combed my hair a little differently, just in case.
The plan was to get in, get in the information I could about Tanya's connection with the bombing, and get out as quickly as possible.
I figured faking an old football injury would do the trick.
- Can I help you?
- Ah, yes.
I'd like to see a doctor, please.
Sign in here, please.
Do you have an appointment, Mr... uh?
Uh, Smith.
No, I don't.
- Then take a number.
- Uhh... six.
- What?
- Is six taken?
Does it have to be between one and ten?
- You'll be called.
- Thank you.
Uh, Mr. Smith?
Sir, we just had a cancellation.
We can take you now.
Dr. Kohlzak?
Good morning, Mr. Smith.
Right this way.
I really appreciate you seeing me like this, uh...
I'm sure it won't take too long.
- When did you first notice the problem?
- Uh, in the back yard, with my uncle.
In the back yard?
With your uncle?
Uh, yes, when he, uh, comes over to visit... we like to go out in the back yard and throw it around for a while.
And what did you and your uncle find out?
Oh, I can't keep up with him.
Mine hurt, especially on the long ones.
I-I can't seem to straighten it out.
It has no feeling.
It-it's kind of numb.
I may have yanked it too much, maybe.
- If you would...
- For what, uh...?
- A sperm count?
- In here?
Well, it's not exactly the back yard, but it'll do.
Uhh... well...
Follow me, and we'll do the necessary paperwork.
Sign these at the bottom, and leave them with the nurse on your way out.
- This way, please.
- What?
- Number 17.
- Oh, no.
A problem?
- Uh, no, no.
- This is 17.
You're next.
- Have we met before?
- I-if you'll excuse me, I-I'm next.
Sir...
Mr. Smith, how are we doing?
I've been busy, if that's what you mean.
Would you like a video tape to assist you?
Oh, do you have "Dances With Wolves"?
"Rocketeer"? "Lady And The Tramp"?
- An adult movie.
- Well...
- The tape was very entertaining.
- Follow me.
Do you have "Spartacus"?
Maintenance, clean up Room 7.
Maintenance, clean up Room 7.
Stat.
- What are you doing?
- Just, uh, freshening up.
You should always look your best, even when you're by yourself.
You know what I mean?
Are you sure we've never met?
Oh, here's my cup.
Back to work.
- Uh, Mr. Smith, are you okay in there?
- I could use a little help.
Dr. Rosenblatt, foreplay in Room 7, please.
Dr. Rosenblatt...
Honey, I've been waiting all day.
I'm wearing the nightgown you bought me for our honeymoon.
Tonight's gonna be a special night.
I'm gonna make love to you for hours and hours...
Wouldn't Mr. Happy like that?
Hours?
Just like we did the first time we were together.
Jane, why don't I get ready and...
soak in the tub for a couple o' days?
Possibly a week.
Oh, you're so cute!
Let me go get the oysters and clams.
Here.
I'll shave your back...
like last time.
Say, Jane, I really don't think we should.
I...
- Frank, what's this?
!
- I-I fell... on a rake.
You're lying.
Now I know why Ed's been calling every half hour.
You've been back on the case, haven't you?
No, no.
I swear.
It's another woman.
In your wildest dreams!
It's bad enough that you wouldn't have a baby.
But I warned you what would happen if you were back to Police Squad.
You... you white Anglo male!
Jane...
Jane, it was nothing, Jane.
I was only doing Ed a small favor.
Some retirement!
I'm leaving, Frank.
But I never thought you'd go back on your word.
- A-aren't you being a little hasty?
- I don't think so.
That should be the cab.
If you need me, you can reach me at Louise's.
Oh, Frank, how could you?
We need some time apart to think about us.
Well, I'm not gonna think.
Why should I start now?
I love you.
Look, baby, I am what I am, and I do what I do.
A few guys make shoelaces, some lay sod, others make a very good living neutering animals.
- I'm a cop.
- Pretty speech, Frank.
But my mind is made up.
I'm leaving!
All right.
Then take this with you.
Guess you know how my lips feel about things.
Goodbye, Frank.
You're listening to KSAD.
All depressing, all the time.
And now here's a dedication to Frank from Jane who just called from a taxi.
And it reads: "Frank, you lying weasel wheenie.
It's bad enough you're shooting blanks, now you're leaving the door wide open, letting all the heat out.
What, you're born in a barn, you stupid...?
He promised me he would never go back to his more police work.
Once a cop, always a cop.
He's married to his work, not me.
That's the way it is.
Cause the mule's always coming second.
There was this great article in Cosmo this month,
"Why All Men Are Pigs".
You should read it!
Frank's just another word for "loser".
As far as I'm concernd, I never wanna see him again.
I wanna get as far away from this town as possible.
We're headed to my friend's cabin.
Down by the smelting plant.
Fresh air will do you good.
Jane, go easy!
That's your second bottle of Chanel.
Louise!
You're witnessing the beginning of a new Jane Spencer-Drebin.
No more little Miss Perky who devoted her life to one man.
I'm out for the new me.
Let's burn rubber!
- You didn't forget anything, did you?
- I hope not.
Just calm down, ma'am.
How many bodies did you find in your swimming pool?
No, sir.
In this state killing a gang member's only an 18-dollar fine.
Just mail with it.
- Frank!
Glad you could make it.
- Welcome, buddy.
Nordberg, Ed.
Did you happen to find Tanya's address, Frank?
Ed, I wrote it down on a hanky, and I can't remember what I did with it.
- I guess I'm getting a bit rusty.
- Ah, that's all right.
That could happen to anybody.
Anyway, I brought you some of "Frank's Never Fail Fudge".
- Hey, go on.
Go on about your business.
- Smells great.
- Don't mind me, I'll stay out of your hair.
- It'll be just like...
Uh, Frank, let me take that.
We've got a little surprise for you.
It's in honor of your 30 years on the force.
Nordberg!
Oh, boy.
This is really great.
Thank you, guys.
We thought it might cheer you up.
We heard about you and Jane.
Jane, Jane...
That name will always remind me of her.
Frank, I feel really bad about all of this.
If there's anything that you need...
- Like dr.
Kevorkian's home phone number.
- Nordberg, put it together!
Frank, I want you to know we're here for you.
Thanks, Ed.
Well, look who's here.
Hi, Frank.
Nice to see you.
Ted.
- Ed, I've got that data for you on the bomb.
- Good.
What did you find out?
Well, the explosive itself is a very fine powder.
It tastes like...
That would be fertilizer, Frank.
It's for another case.
This is what I'm talking about.
We detected a high quantity of nitroglycerine.
Can you tell us where it came from?
I'd be glad to.
Billions of years ago, the earth was a molten mass...
- Ted, I'm talking about the powder.
- Oh, we haven't got a clue about that, Ed.
Hey, let me take that urine specimen from you, Frank.
However, we found a detailed list of the bomber's plans at the scene.
- On a hunch, we analyzed the paper.
- And you go something?
Yes.
The paper came from Statesville Prison.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
We analyzed the wood fibres in the paper and found them to be from the rare Canary Island pine.
Which grows only in Oregon.
Contacting several paper mills in that area led us to a distribution center in Tacoma.
But unfortunately, that's where the trail ended.
And how did you trace it to the Statesville Prison?
Right here, on the letterhead, Frank.
After comparing handwriting in samples with every known bomber currently serving a sentence in Statesville, we came up with a suspect, Rocco Dillon.
He must be masterminding the bombings from inside the prison.
If that's true, there's only one way to find out where Rocco's gonna strike next.
We're gonna have to send someone into Statesville Prison.
I'll do it.
Frank, I couldn't...
I wouldn't feel right about that.
If Rocco finds out you're a cop, you might end up dead.
"You might end up dead" is my middle name.
- What about Jane?
- I don't know her middle name.
But, Ed, I need the action.
I'm going inside the big house.
Frank, Ed, I think you might wanna see this.
We're testing a prototype for a new anti-carjacking device.
I think you'll get a chance to see how it works.
- Get out!
- No.
Don't make me use...
We call it "The Denver Jockstrap".
After being retired for six months, I was finally back in action.
Faster than you can say "Spread 'em!",
I was inside the cold grey walls of Statesville Prison.
I was surrounded by pimps, rapists and murderers.
It was like being in the stands of a Los Angeles Raiders' game.
It was gonna take all my police experience just to stay alive in here.
After a long and generous cavity search, I finally reached my destination:
Maximum security, home of some of the most violent sociopaths in the country.
And the worst of them all, Rocco Dillon.
All right, in here.
Ain't no prison yet could hold me.
Attica!
Attica!
Power to the brothers.
Kill whitey!
Kill whitey!
Knock it off!
You're chirping out real loud for a new canary.
Keep flashing those big eyes, and I'll personally balance and rotate your jaw.
Hey!
You know who you're talking to?
The man is Rocco Dillon.
- Where's your prison number?
- It's unlisted.
Just call me Nick "The Slasher" Magirk.
Look, ham head.
I'm the muscle on this pen.
You just stay out of my way.
Just watch your step, Magirk.
Take it from me, this place here changes a man.
- Oh, yeah, in what way?
- I used to be white.
I was the drummer for the Osmonds.
Screw with me... he'll make you feel pain like you never felt before.
I know, I remember the Osmonds.
- Better hit the rack, Magirk.
- In a minute.
First, I wanna make a list of the people I'm gonna kill in the next couple o' days.
Lights out!
Lock down in two minutes!
My dearest snookie wookums dumpling buns,
I miss you so much.
I haven't felt this bad since... since the last time I was dumped.
I remember it well.
Her name was Gabriella.
We were supposed to be married, but on the day of our wedding, she never showed up.
I was heartbroken, destroyed.
I figured she'd fallen for another man.
Someone who could do to her what I never could.
I thought my life was over until that one glorious day.
That was the day you became my wife.
All our friends gathered to celebrate our love.
It seems like only yesterday.
We were all so overjoyed.
I remember how we wished that we could take everyone with us.
That was the happiest day of my life.
I'll never forget the plans we made for our future.
Things were gonna be so perfect.
We were finally going to get that housekeeper you always wanted.
Hi, Mr. D. Hi, Mrs. D.
And I knew that eventually our dream would come true.
One day we'd have our own little Frank Drebin Jr.
Shut up, Magirk.
I'm tryin' to get some sleep.
Nah, it's no use.
She'll never come back.
Bend over and pick it up for me... would you, lover?
No problem.
Rocco could tell from my little escapade in the shower that I was well endowed with courage.
Now, I had to get on the inside.
Like a blind man at an orgy, I was gonna have to feel things out.
Tyrone!
Got the escape plans right here.
Just you and me.
- Burnett wants in, too.
- Burnett's one of the guards!
- I know, but he's unhappy here.
- All right, all right, whatever.
I got it all worked out right here.
What's this?
Another letter from your mommy?
- Hey, that's private, screw.
- Well, let's see what we have here.
Why don't you give the man back his letter?
Buzz off, butter cheeks!
What's so special about a little letter?
Wait a minute...
An escape plan!
This is your ticket to another 20 years, Dillon.
If the warden gets one look at...
Hey!
You call this slop?
Real slop has got chunks of things in it.
This is more like gruel!
And this Chateau LeBlanc '68 is supposed to be served slightly chilled.
This is room temperature.
- What do you think we are?
Animals?
- No!
What are we?
Homo sapiens?
You're right!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
No, no.
Stop!
Right hand red, left hand blue.
Who's got a hand in my pocket?
Come on, son.
You can do it.
Eat some beans.
You saved my bacon, Magirk.
I'd be in solitary by now if you hadn't done that.
Forget it.
Listen.
I've been watching you, Magirk.
You handle yourself really good.
- Really well.
- Yeah, whatever.
Look.
I got somethin' big coming up on the outside.
Somethin' really big.
I could use someone like you in my gang.
- You got a dental plan?
- Full coverage.
What's the caper?
Now, first we gotta bust out of this playpen.
Thanks to you, we still have an escape plan.
Let's have it.
- It's a good plan.
- I've had better.
Listen.
I've got a foolproof plan.
Oh, my God, they got Tyrone.
Can't... can't we all just get along?
Now that Tyrone was in solitary, it was just me and Rocco.
He had no choice but to trust me.
Shh!
Hold on!
Anyway, I convinced Rocco to dig a tunnel.
It was either that or the laundry truck.
But the thought of lying in a pile of underwear, nose down and skid marks just didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.
Disposing of the dirt was a problem I solved early in the construction.
Outside of some major chafing, we were making good progress.
We kept digging, and night dummies gave the guards the impression we were still in our cell.
Lights out, Magirk.
There was more dirt than I anticipated.
Disposing of it was becoming a tricky business.
Safe!
Where you going?
You're not thinking of Frank again, are you?
- They are playing our song.
- I understand.
Take your time.
- Hello, there.
- Excuse me.
I'm hauling a load of rice cakes down to Big D.
- What do you say to coming' with me?
- No, thank you.
- Well, then, how about a kiss?
- No!
I know when a woman says "no", she really means "yes".
Now, how 'bout that kiss?
- Yes.
- What do you mean "no"?
I know your type.
Come on, baby, we're two of a kind.
Oh, my God, you killed him!
That was an accident.
We have to call the police.
Jane, come to your senses.
You killed a man.
You're a hero to every woman in this country!
Frank.
We have to call Frank.
He'll protect us.
Frank is a man.
He'll see you locked away for the rest of your life.
Jane, I wanna join you.
Help you kill as many men as possible.
Louise.
Do what you have to do.
I'm calling Frank.
Be home, Frank, please.
Answer the phone, snuggle pants.
Frank!
- Hi, this is Frank.
- And Jane.
We're the Drebins.
We're not home right now, so leave a message.
- Oh, which button do I press?
- Oh, no, not that one.
Tanya?
It was another woman.
Frank was telling the truth.
Honeymoon Bay Road.
I bet they're all alone there right now.
Oh, Frank!
Cell inspection!
There's been a rumor of a possible break-out.
If we suspect anyone of attempting to escape, they will be punished severely.
Once word of the escape was out, we had to move quickly, so we headed for the tunnel.
The last few feet had to be dug on the run.
We were sure that another 47 yards would take us beyond the prison walls.
May he rest in peace in the arms of our loving...
Jesus Christ!
Amen.
Rocco had arranged for a getaway car to meet us at our destination.
After making a slight adjustment in our direction, we finally arrived at the rendezvous point... a Los Angeles city high school.
Hey, that was close.
Hey, Rocco, who's the old hag?
- She take one in the face?
- She's my mother!
Oh!
Mrs. Dillon, your son is a ruthless, sadistic, cold-blooded animal.
- You must be very proud of 'im.
- I am.
Ma, I want you to meet a real square egg, Nick "The Slasher" Magirk.
There is fresh clothes in the back.
Rocco's mom was quiet.
I had a feeling she didn't care for me coming along.
Like a midget at a urinal, I was gonna have to stay on my toes.
Hey!
Stop!
Oh, Frank!
That wasn't my fault.
That cow shouldn't have been standin' in the middle of the road anyway.
Hurry up, you're lettin' the flies in!
- Now, what do you think, kid?
- Sweet setup.
No phones...
Miles from the nearest town...
Playboy Channel...
Perfect.
Nice digs, but I'm here for the action.
What are we going after?
Bank, armored cars, Dodgers' payroll?
You're gettin' a little bit too nosy, Magirk.
Relax, ma.
- She's been itching to try our new gun.
- I know the feeling.
It was Tanya.
That bathing suit was never happier.
I had only a second to admire the view.
I had to watch out.
If she made me as a cop, I'd be tonight's meat loaf.
Come here, sexy.
You're all woman.
I can tell just by lookin' at you.
Hey!
She's referring' to me.
I-I was talking about your mother.
That's no way to be walkin' around.
Get some clothes on.
And what are you doing in my bathing suit?
Hey, who's the stud?
Oh, I'd like you to meet the newest member of our gang.
Slasher Magirk...
meet Tanya Peters.
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
I smelled cop on him the minute I saw 'im.
I get that all the time.
The underwear ads.
Played everywhere.
Are you saying you're not a cop?
Well, yeah.
- Well, that's good enough for me.
- Me too.
- I'm fine.
- All right.
Glad that's all cleared up.
Ma, why don't you two kiss and make up?
Huh?
Well, all right.
That's more like it.
I had to get a message to Police Squad.
This thing was turning into more than I could handle by myself.
No phone and miles from civilization, my prospects were bleaker than a gerbils in a bath house.
Who's down there?
Slasher, have you seen my pigeon?
Pigeon?
What pigeon?
- What are you doing?
- I'm, uh, just... contemplating my next move.
Your bishop is exposed.
It's these pants.
I usually wear a fuller cut.
You're all man.
I like that in my men.
You're coming on to me big time, sister, you're purring like a kitten with a fresh mouse.
- But we got a problem.
- You're Jewish?
No.
You're Rocco's girl.
And in my book that chapter is called "Look, But Don't Touch".
I could have two lovers.
Kinky.
But I like my sex the way I play basketball, one on one and with as little dribbling as possible.
Ooh, you're tense, Slasher.
Well, I could relax a little more, if I knew what was goin' on tomorrow.
You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
All I know is that it's downtown and... big.
That's the way I like it.
What else?
Just this...
- What are you doing?
- Uh, thank you for the advice.
- I'll try that recipe out, Ms. Peters.
- How could you?
Well, you just shove your tongue as far down the throat as you can.
Quiet.
You're not supposed to know me here.
That's a goodbye kiss, sister.
- What's all this?
Who's the skirt?
- Uh, just some dizzy dame.
Her car broke down.
I'll take her to the bus, people.
Hey, look a this, she's married.
What if her husband comes looking for her?
He probably will.
He must be a great guy.
He breaks promises.
Well, look at you, traipsing all over the country just to spite a big, wonderful guy.
- He left me.
- More like you left him.
- You should talk!
- Well, listen to you.
- Listen to you!
- Listen to you!
- Listen to you!
- Listen to you!
- Listen to you!
- Listen to you!
Jeez, you two, knock it off!
You'd think you were married or somethin'.
- So, what do you wanna do with her?
- Well, one thing is for sure...
- There's no room for her here.
- I say we bump her off.
Let's plug her right here.
No.
I've been on a job when things went hooey.
I would have given my eyeteeth for a hostage.
Now, we all know that...
women make the best hostages.
They are smaller, easy to take along, eat less, smell nice.
Yeah, we got us an insurance policy.
Good thinking, kid.
Now...
let's get some shut-eye.
Come on, we got a big day ahead of us.
All right.
It's rigged.
Keep your eye on the tower, Slasher.
- It's what's gonna happen tonight.
- Hey, aren't we awfully far away?
Uh, enough.
Pay attention.
On the top of that tower is a device that's gonna net us five million bucks.
It's a little thing I've been working on.
We're gonna detonate it later this evening at an event that the whole world will be watchin'.
- Your crowning achievement.
- It's for both of us, ma.
- All set?
- Set.
Very impressive.
Cool.
Cool.
Yes, America will be brought to its knees by this ultimate terrorist act.
That's right, this will be more embarrassing to the United States than Tonya Harding.
We're almost there.
I don't wanna miss this.
Give my regards to Mrs. Gaddafi.
Oh, and tell her thanks for the cookies.
It's another beautiful night in Los Angeles, and the stars are shining bright for the 66th annual Academy Awards.
Thousands of fans are clamoring to get a glimpse of their favorite celebrities.
And here are two of them, "Weird Al" Yankovic and Vanna White.
Slasher, put the dame in the trunk.
I'll meet you and ma around back in ten minutes.
Got the passes?
- We pull this up, it's 5 million big ones.
- Not bad, ma.
- Frank, what's gonna happen to me?
- Shh, I have an idea.
- All right, Slasher.
You know what to do.
- Right.
Make sure the spare tires are inflated and check all the fluid levels.
No, you muffin head.
The dame.
Keep an eye on 'er.
We hit trouble, she's a bullet shield.
Ladies and gentlemen, here now to present the Academy's Lifetime Achievement Award...
Ready, 3.
Roll tape.
Go to clip.
Aspirin, please.
Go to 3.
Ready, 4...
This year's Lifetime Achievement Award winner's credits include some of the greatest moments ever captured on celluloid.
Films such as "Sandals and Loincloth", 1958.
"Sweaty Boatmen", 1959.
"The Leather Clad Centurion", 1960, and his first color feature in 1966, "Big Shiny Spears".
Okay.
There's the man from Bryce/Porterhouse.
He's the guy that guards the envelopes until they're handed out.
That pin is not gonna budge for the take.
Now, you know what to do.
Distract him so I get to the envelopes to plant the bomb.
Accepting the award for Mr. Bronkowitz is Margaret Red Feather.
That ought to do it.
You'll never get away with this.
Rocco's gonna kill you whoever you are.
- Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Frank, isn't that a little unusual?
Not really.
It happened to me a couple o' times.
Now, here's the plan.
Plan?
You'll never stop Rocco.
- Your chances are one in a million.
- That's still better than any state lottery.
Look.
I'm the good guy.
I can't let the bad guys win.
Our children can't be raised in fear.
Don't you see?
If we can't stop them, they're gonna blow that place sky high.
It'll be a tragedy, unless, of course, it happens during a dance number.
Come on.
Does that radio work?
Call Police Squad.
Tell 'em Frank Drebin...
Forget it.
I wonder what the devil he wanted.
Hold on.
Sergeant Frank Drebin, detective lieutenant, Police Squad.
- Yeah, and I'm Robert De Niro.
- Mr. De Niro, we've got to get inside.
Uh-huh.
You and 10,000 other people.
Now, move along.
Movie stars only.
Come on.
I got a better idea.
And cue talent.
And now, to present the award for Best Supporting Actress... our Mariel Hemingway and Elliot Gould.
Thank you.
The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are:
Mary Lou Retton, "Fatal Affair", one woman's ordeal to overcome the death of her cat, set against the background of the Hindenburg disaster.
Morgan Fairchild, "Final Proposal", one courageous pioneer woman's triumphant victory over bulimia, set against the background of the Donner Party Crossing.
Very sorry about this, but it's official police business.
Shannen Doherty, "Basic Analysis", one woman's triumph over a yeast infection, set against the background of the tragic Buffalo Bill season of 1991.
Thank you, sheriff.
Still no word of Frank or Rocco and his gang.
Frankly, I'm gettin' worried.
Frank should've phoned in by now.
Let me just check your tickets, folks.
Lovely gown.
Is that Cool Whip?
All right, Tim and Erica Brown.
Okay, enjoy the show.
Let's see.
Vanna White, "Weird Al" Yankovic.
Okay!
Enjoy the awards.
Ready, 3... and 3.
And Florence Henderson, "Analysis of a Proposal"...
Rocco could be anywhere.
He had plenty of time to plant the bomb.
Where could it be?
- And the winner is...
- Boy, this is gonna be dynamite.
Jane.
Frank, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yes.
Florence Henderson's gonna win.
It's about time.
No!
The bomb is in one of those envelopes.
You're right!
And the winner is...
Mary Lou Retton for "Fatal Affair".
I'm sorry, we were... rooting for Florence Henderson.
We've got to get to those envelopes before they open any more.
- I never realized there'd be this many.
- They added 75 new categories.
"Best Actor in a Columbus movie"?
To present the award for Best Director is star of stage and screen Raquel Welch and the distinguished host of his own award-winning talk show, Phil Donahue.
That might be the envelope for the bomb.
Keep looking here.
One more second, Mr. Donahue.
Oh, my God!
Look at Donahue.
Stop the stairs, Joey.
Joey!
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to present the...
What the hell...?
!
- Jesus!
- Go to commercial.
Easy now.
Easy.
Talk to me.
What happened, ma?
Slasher is Frank Drebin of Police Squad.
Lousy, two-bit copper punk!
I treated him like my brother... the one I didn't kill.
- He might find the bomb.
- Not if I find him first.
Back from commercial in 5 seconds.
Hurry up with the mike.
And cue Donahue.
In 3... 2...
Read the...
Read it.
Read the card, moron.
"Well, Raquel, this certainly is a special evening.
Phew!"
"I can barely catch my breath.
Turn it over to Raquel."
"Raquel:
I'm used to being out of breath, working out to my..."
What the hell is he doing?
!
"Hold for laughter and applause.
To Phil.
Gets me out of breath just watching you."
- "To Raquel.
Oh, Phil..."
- I'm supposed to read that.
"But let's get to the subject at hand.
Pick up the envelope..."
The nominees for best director are:
Sir Richard Attenborough for his musical based on the life of Mother Teresa, "Mother".
Food, I love food and I'm really in the mood for a big corn dog of pooh-pooh platter two ding-dongs, it doesn't matter and some tuna helper, I'll be racing back for more
But don't get any sausage cause I'll blow chunks on the floor.
Spike Lee, "X II
- The Merchandising"
Nordberg, look.
That's Frank at the Academy Awards.
Hey, how did he get tickets?
Nordberg.
That's where Rocco Dillon is going to strike next, he's planning on blowing up the Academy Awards.
We've gotta to get there.
But, captain, we-we're not invited.
We're cops.
- It's for you.
- Nordberg, Police Squad.
Hello.
Hello.
Henderson, see about this phone.
I think it's broke.
And now, here are today's lucky lotto numbers.
Get your tickets ready because here they come: 12, 22, 18 and 9.
And for his tale of genetics gone haywire in a retirement community,
Steven Spielberg, "Geriatric Park".
And... the winner is...
- Uh, Raquel, just a second.
- Now what?
- I just had a thought.
- Oh, great.
This show is being seen all over the world, I was thinking if we could all send good thoughts, transmit them through these cameras here to men like the leader of China, Wing Wa Woo Tong, so that they might finally be nice.
Thank you.
And the winner is...
Uh, Raquel, so many go to bed hungry in this nation, yet cat food is full of tuna.
I can't help but think each time I go to the zoo and see those porpoises crammed into those tiny tanks,
"What a waste that is".
Butcher half of them now!
That's hundreds of tons of dolphin meat that can be fed to our cats, freeing up that tuna for our nation's hungry.
- And... the winner is...
- And so many, uh, are cold, shivering in the night.
So I say "Take those cats, skin them."
- "Use their fur to keep hundreds warm."
- Jesus, Phil.
And the winner is...
- You!
- Give me that!
- Not one move.
- That barrel's cold.
It's room temperature.
Let's go.
It's okay.
It's not the bomb.
- Jane.
Jane!
- Big trouble!
Jane.
Jane.
- Silver hair.
- About 6 2.
- Kinda looked like Phil Donahue.
- Yeah.
That's the guy!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome internationally renowned actress and singing star Pia Zadora.
- There he is!
- There he is!
Stop 'im!
- Excuse me, is that snot on your shoe?
- Snot?
Where?
Oh, no.
Not him again.
Please, God.
Come on, get off the stage!
I'm Ed Hocken.
This is officer Nordberg from Police Squad.
- We're here to prevent a disaster.
- Too late for that.
Hey.
It's Frank.
Come on, Nordberg.
We've got to get to Frank.
Jane!
Jane!
Uh-huh!
I knew I'd bump into you around here somewhere.
I want answers, cherry cakes.
- I love you.
- Wrong answer.
I got out of the Sap-of-the-Month Club a long time ago.
Now, listen to me, angel drawers, you've got one last chance.
And I don't mean one of those Major-League-Baseball-Steve-Howe kind of last chances.
- Now, where is Jane?
- I swear I don't know.
- All right, then, where is the bomb?
- It's in the Best Picture envelope.
Oh, Mr. Drebin, I wanna go straight.
I'm tired of the lies.
Oh, kiss me.
Please, kiss me.
I never kissed lips so innocent, so pure.
He looked like Phil Donahue.
White hair.
That's the guy!
- Frank?
- I'll get him, captain.
Ladies and gentlemen, to present the Best Picture Award are two of America's most distinguished actors.
Olympia Dukakis and James Earl Jones.
Oh, Lord.
What's that?
Looks like Phil Donahue throwing up in a tuba.
Someone make a note.
I don't think we should have Phil Donahue back next year.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening.
It's a privilege for us to present the final award of tonight's ceremony.
Frank, we've been worried about you.
Where's Rocco?
Where's Tanya?
- Come on, Frank, sit down.
Take it easy.
- Frank.
Thank God you're all right.
"Indecent Instincts" and "Sawdust and Mildew".
Oddly enough, Olympia, every one of these movies was a box office hit, except for one.
- What's that?
- It's the Best Picture Award.
Yeah.
Momma needs all "Sawdust and Mildew".
Olympia, would you do the honors, please?
Oh, my God!
That's the one!
The award for this year's best picture goes to...
- Wait!
- Oh, great.
Sorry about this.
Loved you in "Coneheads".
You, too.
Let me open this.
It's the bomb!
Freeze, and nobody gets hurt!
Well... from now on.
Back in your seats, you little weasels.
Party's over!
This program's been permanently interrupted.
Okay, everybody, don't panic.
Stay with it.
Camera 2, move in on the old lady.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Better move back, 2.
- I said "No one moves".
- Sit down!
Now pay attention!
I don't wanna kill nobody unless I have to.
You hear me?
All right.
Drop your guns and kick 'em over here.
I believe that bomb belongs to me.
Hand it over...
Drebin.
You wanna do the honors of killin' him, ma?
Blink, and I start shootin'.
Give me that gun.
- Oh, my God!
- I'm not fallin' for that one, sister.
- Ma!
- She's a goner, Rocco.
Dead?
Then that's it.
I'm comin' with you, ma!
Pull out the bomb, Drebin.
If you don't, I'll shoot the dame.
All right, Rocco.
All right.
- I'll do what you say.
- Frank!
Just don't harm her.
Frank, if you pull out the bomb, you'll kill me anyway.
And everyone else in this theatre.
- Yeah.
No dice, Rocco.
- Then I'll plug 'er.
You shoot her and I'll empty this envelope.
Frank, think about it.
It's all right, you'll be dead.
Then you'll kill yourself.
And everyone here.
Yeah.
Then I'll shoot you, Drebin, if you don't do as I say.
- Jane?
- I'd be safe.
So would everyone else.
But you'd be dead.
This is getting a little complicated, Rocco.
Let's look at this logically.
You're the psychotic, you should have the envelope.
I should have the gun.
- Frank!
- I know what I'm doing.
All right.
Here's your Best Picture, in front of a whole worldwide audience.
- This place is going up.
- Well, if I'm goin' out, I'm goin' out happy.
Wait a minute, Rocco, before we're all blown to bits.
Mind if I pull the underwear out of my crack?
A man's gotta go comfortable.
All right, but that's it.
All right, give it up, Rocco, you're history!
Look, George Hamilton!
Come and get me, Drebin.
Throw me a gun.
Nordberg, get rid of the bomb.
Hold on, sweetheart.
Frank, help me!
- Frank!
- I know what I'm doing.
I hate heights.
Move it, sister.
Screw the commercials!
We're sticking with this.
All right, copper.
You killed my ma.
I'm taking the dame away from you.
You hear me, copper?
One push and Mrs. Drebin here becomes linoleum.
Get a camera up there.
I don't care how!
This could be my best work!
Any last words, sweetheart, before I throw you off this catwalk?
Yes.
Don't do it.
- Anything else?
- Frank, I love you.
Yes, I want the world to know you're the perfect man.
- Oh, Frank, I hope you can hear me.
- And they told me I couldn't do drama.
I was wrong.
Taking you away from Police Squad was a mistake.
I know now that's why you couldn't perform decent sex with me.
Yes, I realize that now, Frank, and a lot of other things.
Everything's under control.
Nobody moves!
Any vibration might set this thing off.
Frank, I've learned my lesson.
And even though it may be too late for me,
I want all you ladies out there to remember something.
Don't ever take your men for granted.
Because good men don't just fall out of the sky.
He's caught up in the cable.
Frank, do something.
Hurry.
I'm coming, ma!
- Rocco?
- Pahpshmir?
Jane, I never want us to be apart again.
Oh, Frank, you like me, you really like me.
- Frank, slow down.
- Hurry up, we're late!
Relax, Frank.
There's plenty of time.
Did you bring the camcorder?
Right here.
- What room is she in?
- Delivery room.
This must be it.
Jane, I'm here.
Frank is here now.
- Push!
Bear down now.
- Breathe, honey.
Breathe, Jane.
One more push.
That's it.
Congratulations, dad.
It's a boy.
Nordberg!
Come back here!
- Frank!
It's a boy.
- I know!

Hey, look!
It's the President!
And the Pope!
Oh, my God!
Look!
It's disgruntled postal workers.
Wait a minute!
Give me my baby back!
- Are you all right?
- I'm soaking wet.
- I'll get the talcum powder.
- It's not that.
I had a nightmare.
Crime all around me, I couldn't stop it.
- Frank, it was just a dream.
- You're right.
All I need is a good night's rest.
Tomorrow everything will be fine.
How's my little boy?
Getting along OK, sweetie?
As well as a heterosexual can in prison.
I don't know if I can take it any longer.
- How's Tanya?
- Tanya's the same.
Milky, creamy skin, pouting red lips, firm buttocks, ample breasts, ears you'd love to stick your tongue into...
- I'll get guy cramps if you keep this up.
- Sorry.
There's somebody here to see you.
Pahpshmir!
- My people are very upset.
- Of course, they're Arab terrorists.
You're supposed to be the world's best terrorist bomber.
- Train stations, government buildings.
- The devastation in South Florida.
- That was Hurricane Andrew.
- That's what they told the public.
We wanted to embarrass the USA.
You've made the police look like heroes.
I told you.
A first-class job would cost five million.
If you want to step up the price,
I got a target that'll make City Hall look like chicken feed.
A big target.
Why should anything be different?
Because five million dollars buys me!
I'm breaking out of here.
If you fail this time, Mr. Dillon, my people won't be so forgiving.
Fail?
Show me one man who can stop me.
Attention shoppers, be sure to check out our special on paper towels.
That's aisle seven.
Hey!
- Give it to me!
- My purse!
Somebody help me!
- Let go of the purse, lady!
- Help me!
For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow which nobody can deny.
Well, we shot a lot of people together.
It's been great.
Today I retire.
If I do any shooting now, it'll have to be in my own home.
Hopefully, it'll be an intruder and not an in-law like at my bachelor party.
Ed, I officially give you my gun and my badge.
And...
Jane and I would like to keep the handcuffs as a souvenir.
Cheer up, Ed.
This is not goodbye.
This is just "I won't ever see you again".
- Somebody help me!
- Out of my way!
- It.
Drebin!
Frank!
Didn't you see that?
- What?
Oh...
Yes, kitty litter.
Two bags for a dollar.
Great!
Order.
The jury will disregard that last statement.
Continue, counselor.
- The alimony had been set by the court.
- Yes, but...
You haven't paid alimony in two years, repeatedly defying a court order.
- Isn't that right, Mr. Clayton?
- I'd lost her address.
She moved twice.
Don't lie to me.
You're under oath.
Do you know what the penalty for perjury is?
- I'll ask you that again.
- Objection!
Your Honor, I...
Ow, ow, gee.
- Counsel is leading the witness.
- Sustained!
Mommy said no pounding when she's in session.
Read the prosecution's last statement.
"Don't lie to me, Mr. Clayton.
You're under oath." Good boy.
"Do you know what the penalty for perjury is?"
That's all I have, Your Honor.
You may continue, Ms Spencer-Drebin.
Prosecution rests.
Defense Attorney Ms Davies-Jacobs-Steiner-Lazlo.
No further questions.
Court will recess until after the morning feeding.
- We can win this.
I can feel it.
- Yes, of course.
- I married the wrong man.
- I never thought that was possible.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, nothing.
Louise, there's no such thing as the wrong man.
You just have to work at it.
Now, let's see.
Mr. and Mrs. Drebin, right?
Now, you two have been married for six months?
Yes.
We really appreciate you seeing us, Doctor.
Our last therapist recommended you.
Yes, I was sorry to hear about his suicide.
A couple need to get off on the right foot and not get caught up in blame.
- Now, which one of you is impotent?
- That would be him.
Yes, of course.
- Why don't you ask who's frigid?
- That would be him.
- How would you know?
- He resents that I'm a working woman.
He has no idea what a woman wants or needs.
- You're so insensitive.
- Is this that toilet seat thing?
I want to have a baby.
Every time we make love, you have a headache.
I'm not a piece of meat.
I'm trying!
I've got ointments, lotions, creams, books, things that vibrate...
- Frank!
- Maybe it's your fault.
Have you tried sexy lingerie?
Lacy underwear?
A black teddy?
- I've tried them all.
They don't work.
- Oh!
Why don't you want a child?
Didn't I try to adopt that 18-year old Korean girl?
Jane, Frank, here's what I suggest.
Make tonight a special night.
Dinner, wine, romantic music.
Put on the 24-hour Johnny Mathis station.
Just be Jane and Frank.
Lovers!
We haven't had a night like that in a long time.
- Not together.
- Frank!
Jane, having a baby is a big responsibility.
Like being in charge of sanitation at a Haitian jail.
I'm just frightened.
Let's make tonight something special.
Oh, honey, it's just that I love you so much.
My little lover sparrow.
My puppy wuppy wuvver.
My little love biscuit.
- My little snookie wookums.
- My little lady cheesy puffy.
Mr. and Mrs. Drebin, please, I'm a diabetic.
I think you ought to go now.
- I never thought we'd end this way.
- How did you think we'd end?
I don't know.
Some other way.
Oh, Jason, please...
Bobbi...
- I've been hurt before.
- We have to fight this thing together.
Ed, Nordberg!
It's been a long time!
- Good to see you, buddy.
- You look terrific.
I'm taking a step class, and I got a thigh master for Christmas.
Where are my manners?
Come on in!
- How charming!
- Sit, sit.
Excuse the mess.
It's my ironing day.
I've just frosted some cupcakes.
- Would you care for one?
- Not now.
We're having trouble with a terrorist threat.
- Police Squad is certain that...
- I'd love a cupcake.
- That coffee smells great.
- I grind my own beans.
We're here because we need your help with something.
- They're great!
- I'd hoped you'd like them.
Made from scratch.
I'll just get off my feet.
We may have a lead on a suspect in the City Hall bombing attempt.
These were taken by a photographer.
- She was used as a diversion.
- We've had them enlarged.
- They look familiar.
- No, Frank, the pin.
She's a nurse.
Can I keep this one?
We traced her to the Karlson Clinic on Myrtlewood.
Her name is Tanya Peters.
- Do you know her?
- Don't you remember back in the 70s?
The big disco shoot out.
Hey, Ed.
What's happening, my man?
We missed you last night at the fondue party.
Couldn't make it.
I saw the Village People.
They're gas.
- Far out, I can dig it!
- What's this?
One dead disco dancer.
- Bummer!
What a mind bender.
- We think it was a love triangle.
This is the suspect's girlfriend, Tanya Peters.
- Cigarette?
- Yes, I know.
We'll need a statement from you down at the station.
- Nordberg!
- Coming, lieutenant!
I do remember!
You were one of the first test cases for minoxidol.
- What?
- I'm glad I could be of help.
If you don't mind, I've got a rump of lamb to roast.
- We need a favor.
- It's not that big a rump roast.
It's not that.
We need you to go undercover at the clinic.
I've quit police work.
You're whistling up the wrong neck of the woods.
I wouldn't ask, but we're in a bind.
- What about Hedges and O'Malley?
- They're in Hawaii... together.
I can't.
Jane and I have a special evening planned.
It'll only take a few hours.
Still time to make dinner.
I don't know.
I'll have to make pork chops.
Think of all the crime.
Nobody is safe.
You'd be protecting Jane.
You'd be protecting all the Janes of the world.
- You haven't shot anybody in 6 months.
- That's true.
Funny how you miss the little things.
Might be good to feel cold steel against my thigh again.
The thrill of a chase... to be a man!
After folding the laundry, I set out for the clinic.
Police operations require a foolproof disguise.
This operation was no different.
I had no idea if Tanya would recognize me, so I wore fake glasses.
I combed my hair differently, just in case.
I planned to get in and find out about Tanya's connection with the bombing, and get out as quickly as possible.
I figured faking an old football injury would do the trick.
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see a doctor.
Sign in here, please.
Do you have an appointment, Mr.?
Smith.
No, I don't.
- Then take a number.
- Six.
- What?
- Is six taken?
Does it have to be between one and ten?
- You'll be called.
- Thank you.
Mr. Smith?
We've had a cancellation.
We can take you now.
Dr. Kohlzak?
Good morning, Mr. Smith.
Right this way.
I appreciate you seeing me.
I'm sure it won't take too long.
- When did you first notice the problem?
- In the back yard with my uncle.
- In the back yard?
With your uncle?
- Yes, when he visits we like to go out in the back yard and throw it around.
What did you and your uncle find out?
I can't keep up with him.
Mine hurt, especially on the long ones.
I can't seem to straighten it out.
It has no feeling.
It's kind of numb.
I may have yanked it too much, maybe.
- If you would...
- For what?
- A sperm count.
- In here?
It's not exactly the back yard, but it will do.
Well...
Follow me, and we'll do the necessary paperwork.
Sign these at the bottom, and leave them with the nurse.
- This way, please.
- What?
- Number 17.
- A problem?
- No.
- This is 17.
You're next.
- Have we met before?
- If you excuse me, I'm next.
Sir...
Mr. Smith, how are we doing?
I've been busy, if that's what you mean.
Would you like a video tape to assist you?
Do you have "Dances With Wolves"?
"Rocketeer"? "Lady And The Tramp"?
An adult movie.
The tape was very entertaining.
Follow me.
Do you have "Spartacus"?
Maintenance, clean up Room 7.
Maintenance, clean up Room 7.
Stat.
- What are you doing?
- Freshening up.
You should always look your best, even by yourself.
Are you sure we've never met?
Oh, here's my cup.
Back to work.
Mr. Smith, are you OK in there?
I could use a little help.
Dr. Rosenblatt, foreplay in Room 7, please.
Honey, I've been waiting all day.
I'm wearing the nightgown you bought me for our honeymoon.
Tonight's gonna be special.
I'll make love to you for hours and hours.
Wouldn't Mr. Happy like that?
- Hours?
- Like our first time together.
Why don't I get ready and soak in the tub for a couple of days?
Possibly a week.
So cute!
Let me go and get the oysters and clams.
Here.
I'll shave your back like last time.
Jane, I really don't think we should.
- Frank, what's this?
!
- I fell... on a rake.
You're lying.
Now I know why Ed's been calling.
- You've been back on the case.
- No, I swear.
It's another woman.
In your wildest dreams!
It's bad enough you won't have a baby.
I warned you against working again.
You white Anglo male!
Jane, it was nothing.
I was only doing Ed a small favor.
Some retirement!
I'm leaving.
I never thought you'd go back on your word.
- Aren't you being a little hasty?
- I don't think so.
That's the cab.
You can reach me at Louise's.
How could you?
We need some time apart to think about us.
I'm not going to think.
Why now?
I love you.
Look, I am what I am, and I do what I do.
Some make shoelaces, some make a living neutering animals.
- I am a cop.
- Pretty speech.
My mind is made up, I'm leaving!
All right, then take this with you.
I guess you know how my lips feel about things.
Goodbye, Frank.
Your listening to K.S.A.D. All depressing, all the time.
Here's a dedication to Frank from Jane calling from a taxi.
You not only shoot blanks, you leave the door open, letting the heat out.
Were you born in a barn?
He wouldn't do any more police work.
Once a cop, always a cop.
- He's married to his work, not me.
- You'll come second.
There's an article in Cosmo, "Why All Men Are Pigs".
Read it!
Frank's just another word for "loser".
I never want to see him again.
I want to get far away from here.
We'll go to my friend's cabin.
The fresh air will do you good.
Go easy!
That's your second bottle of Chanel.
This is the beginning of a new Jane Spencer-Drebin.
No more Miss Perky who devoted her life to one man.
I'm out for the new me.
Let's burn rubber!
- Have you forgotten anything?
- I hope not.
Calm down.
How many bodies did you find in your pool?
In this state killing a gang member is only an $18 fine.
- Frank!
Glad you could make it.
- Welcome, buddy.
- Nordberg, Ed.
- Did you find Tanya's address?
I wrote it down on a hanky, and I can't remember what I did with it.
- I'm getting rusty.
- That could happen to anybody.
I brought you some of "Frank's Never Fail Fudge".
- Go on about your business.
- Smells great.
- I'll stay out of your hair.
- It'll be just like...
Frank, let me get that.
We have a surprise for you.
In honor of your 30 years on the force.
Nordberg!
Oh, boy.
This is really great.
Thank you, guys.
It might cheer you up.
We heard about you and Jane.
Jane, Jane...
The name will always remind me of her.
I feel bad about this.
If there's anything you need?
- Like Dr. Kevorkian's home number.
- Nordberg, put it together!
- We're here for you.
- Thanks.
- Look who's here.
Nice to see you.
- Ted.
- I have data for you on the bomb.
- What did you find out?
- The explosive is a very fine powder.
- It tastes like...
That's fertilizer.
It's for another case.
This is what I'm talking about.
- We detected nitroglycerine.
- Can you tell us where it came from?
I'd be glad to.
Billions of years ago, the earth was a molten mass...
- I mean the powder.
- We have no clue.
Let me take that urine, Frank.
We found a list of the bomber's plans at the scene.
- We analyzed the paper.
- And?
The paper is from Statesville Prison.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
The wood is from the rare Canary Island Pine.
It only grows in Oregon.
Contacting paper mills led us to a distribution center in Tacoma.
There the trail ended.
- How did you trace it to Statesville?
- The letterhead.
We compared the handwriting of all bombers serving in Statesville and found a suspect, Rocco Dillon.
He's masterminding the bombings from the prison.
If so, there's only one way to find out where Rocco'll strike next.
- We'll have to send someone in prison.
- I'll do it.
I wouldn't feel right about that.
If Rocco finds out, you might end up dead.
"You might end up dead" is my middle name.
- What about Jane?
- I don't know hers.
I need the action.
I'm going inside the big house.
Frank, Ed, you might want to see this.
We're testing a prototype for a new anti-carjacking device.
You'll get to see how it works.
- Get out!
- No.
Don't make me use...
"The Denver Jockstrap".
After being retired for six months, I was back in action.
Faster than you say "Spread 'em!", I was inside Statesville Prison.
I was surrounded by pimps, rapists and murderers.
It was like being in the stands of an LA Raiders' game.
It was going to take all my police experience just to stay alive in here.
After a long and generous cavity search, I reached my destination:
Maximum security, home of some of the country's most violent sociopaths.
And the worst of them all, Rocco Dillon.
All right, in here.
Ain't no prison yet could hold me.
Attica!
Attica!
Power to the brothers.
Kill whitey, kill whitey!
Knock it off!
You're chirping loud for a new canary.
Keep flashing your eyes, and I'll balance your jaw.
Hey!
You know who you're talking to?
The man is Rocco Dillon.
- Where's your prison number?
- It's unlisted.
Just call me Nick "The Slasher" Magirk.
Look, ham head.
I'm the muscle in this pen.
Stay out of my way.
Just watch your step, Magirk.
Take it from me, this place changes a man.
- Oh, yeah, in what way?
- I used to be white.
I was the drummer for the Osmonds.
Screw with me, he'll make you feel pain you've never felt before.
I know, I remember the Osmonds.
- Better hit the rack, Magirk.
- In a minute.
First I'll make a list of the people I'm gonna kill in the next few days.
Lights out!
Lock down in two minutes!
My dearest snookie wookums buns,
I miss you so much.
I haven't felt this bad since... the last time I was dumped.
I remember it well.
Her name was Gabriella.
We were supposed to marry, but on our wedding day, she never showed up.
I was heartbroken, destroyed.
I figured she'd fallen for another man.
Someone who could do to her what I never could.
I thought my life was over until that one glorious day.
That was the day you became my wife.
All our friends celebrated our love.
It seemed like only yesterday.
We were all so overjoyed.
We wished they all could come with us.
That was the happiest day of my life.
I'll never forget the plans we made.
Things were going to be perfect.
We were going to get that housekeeper you always wanted.
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. D.
I knew that eventually our dream would come true.
One day we'd have our own Frank Drebin Jr.
Shut up, Magirk.
I'm trying to sleep.
It's no use.
She'll never come back.
Bend over and pick it up for me would you, lover?
No problem.
Rocco could tell from my escapade in the shower that I was courageous.
Now, I had to get on the inside.
Like a blind man at an orgy, I would have to feel things out.
Tyrone, I've got the escape plans here.
Just you and me.
- Burnett wants in, too.
- He's a guard!
- I know, but he's unhappy here.
- All right, whatever.
Got it all worked out right here.
What's this?
Another letter from your mommy?
- That's private, screw.
- Let's have a look.
- Give him back his letter.
- Buzz off, butter cheeks.
What's so special about a little letter?
Wait a minute... an escape plan!
This is your ticket to another 20 years.
If the Warden gets one look...
You call this slop?
Real slop has got chunks of things in it.
This is more like gruel!
This Chateau LeBlanc '68 is supposed to be served slightly chilled.
This is room temperature.
- What do you think we are?
Animals?
- No!
What are we?
Homo sapiens?
You're right!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
No, no.
Stop!
Right hand red, left hand blue.
Who's got a hand in my pocket?
Come on, son.
You can do it.
Eat some beans.
You saved my bacon.
I'd be in solitary if you hadn't done that.
You've been handling yourself really good.
- Really well.
- Whatever.
I've got something big coming up.
I could have use for you.
You've got a dental plan?
What's the caper?
We've got to bust out of this playpen.
Thanks to you, we have an escape plan.
- It's a good plan.
- I've had better.
Listen, I've got a foolproof plan.
They've got Tyrone.
Can't we all just get along?
Now that Tyrone was in solitary, it was just me and Rocco.
He had no choice but to trust me...
Shh!
Hold on!
Anyway, I convinced Rocco to dig a tunnel.
It was either that or the laundry truck.
The thought of lying nose down in underwear with skid marks didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.
Disposing of the dirt was a problem I solved early.
Outside of some major chaffing, we made good progress.
We kept digging, and dummies gave the impression we were in our cell.
Lights out, Magirk.
There was more dirt than I anticipated.
Disposing of it was tricky.
Safe!
Where are you going?
Are you thinking of Frank again?
- They are playing our song.
- I understand.
Take your time.
- Hello, there.
- Excuse me.
I'm hauling a load of rice cakes to Big D.
- Why don't you come?
- No.
- How about a kiss?
- No!
I know women mean "yes" when they say "no".
How about that kiss?
- Yes.
- What do you mean "no"?
Come on, baby, we're two of a kind.
- You killed him!
- It was an accident.
Call the police.
Come to your senses.
You killed a man.
You're a hero to all American women!
Call Frank.
He'll protect us.
He's a man.
He'll lock you away for life.
I wanna help you kill as many men as possible.
Do what you have to do.
I'm calling Frank.
Be home, Frank, please.
Answer the phone, snuggle pants.
Frank!
- Hi, this is Frank.
- And Jane.
We're the Drebins.
We're not home right now.
Leave a message.
- Which button do I press?
- Not that one.
Tanya?
It was another woman.
Frank was telling the truth.
Honeymoon Bay Road, I bet they're there right now.
Oh, Frank!
Cell inspection!
There's been a rumor of a possible break-out.
If we suspect anyone of attempting to escape, they will be punished severely.
Once word of the escape was out, we had to move for the tunnel.
The last few feet had to be dug on the run.
We were sure that another 47 yards would take us beyond the prison walls.
May he rest in peace in the arms of our loving...
Jesus Christ!
Amen.
Rocco had arranged for a getaway car to meet us.
After adjusting our direction, we arrived at the rendezvous point a Los Angeles city high school.
Hey, that was close.
Hey, Rocco, who's the old hag?
- She take one in the face?
- She's my mother!
Mrs. Dillon, your son is a ruthless, sadistic, cold-blooded animal.
- You must be very proud of him.
- I am.
Ma, I want you to meet a real square egg, Nick "The Slasher" Magirk.
There are fresh clothes in the back.
Rocco's mother was quiet.
I sensed she didn't like me coming along.
Like a midget at a urinal, I would have to stay on my toes.
Hey!
Stop!
Oh, Frank!
It wasn't my fault.
That cow shouldn't have been on the road.
Hurry up, you're letting the flies in!
- What do you think, kid?
- Sweet setup.
No phones.
Miles from the nearest town.
Playboy Channel.
Perfect.
Nice digs, but I'm here for the action.
Are we taking banks or armored cars?
- You're getting too nosy, Magirk.
- Relax, Ma.
- She's been itching to try this gun.
- I know the feeling.
It was Tanya.
That bathing suit was never happier.
I had only a second to admire the view.
I had to watch out.
If she made me as a cop, I'd be tonight's meat loaf.
- Come here, sexy.
- You're all woman.
I can tell.
Hey, she's referring to me.
I was talking about your mother.
That's no way to be walking around.
Get clothes on.
And what are you doing in my bathing suit?
- Hey, who's the stud?
- Meet our newest gang member.
Slasher Magirk, meet Tanya Peters.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
I smelt cop the minute I saw him.
I get that all the time.
The underwear ads.
Are you saying you're not a cop?
Well, yeah.
- That's good enough for me.
- I'm fine.
I'm glad that's all cleared up.
Ma, why don't you two kiss and make up?
Well, all right.
That's more like it.
I had to get a message to the squad.
This was more than I could handle by myself.
No phone and miles from people, I was worse off than a gerbil in a bath house.
Who's there?
Slasher, have you seen my pigeon?
Pigeon?
What pigeon?
- What are you doing?
- I'm just contemplating my next move.
Your bishop is exposed.
It's these pants.
I usually wear a fuller cut.
You're all man.
I like that in my men.
You're coming on to me big time, purring like a kitten with a mouse.
- But we got a problem.
- You're Jewish?
No.
You're Rocco's girl.
In my book that chapter is called "Look, But Don't Touch".
I could have two lovers.
Kinky.
But I like my sex the way I play basketball, one on one and with as little dribbling as possible.
You're tense, Slasher.
I could relax more, if I knew what was on tomorrow.
Do you know anything about that?
All I know is that it's downtown and... big.
That's the way I like it.
What else?
Just this...
- What are you doing?
- Thank you for the advice.
- I'll try that recipe out, Ms Peters.
- How could you?
You shove your tongue as far down as you can.
Quiet.
You're not supposed to know me here.
That's a goodbye kiss, sister.
- What's this?
Who's the skirt?
- Just some dizzy dame.
Her car broke down.
I'll take her to the bus.
Look, she's married.
What if her husband comes here?
- He will.
He must be great.
- He breaks promises.
And you traipse all over to spite a wonderful guy.
- He left me.
- You left him.
- You should talk!
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you!
- Listen to you!
You two, knock it off!
You'd think you were married.
- What do you want to do with her?
- One thing is for sure there's no room for her here.
- I say we bump her off.
- Let's plug her.
- No.
I was on a job that went hooey.
I'd have given my eyeteeth for a hostage.
Women make the best ones.
They are smaller, easy to take along, eat less, smell nice.
Yeah, we got us an insurance policy.
Good thinking, kid.
Come on, let's get some shut-eye.
We got a big day ahead of us.
It's rigged.
Keep your eye on the tower.
- It's what's going to happen tonight.
- Aren't we awfully far away?
On the top of that tower is a device that's going to net us five million bucks.
A thing I've been working on.
We'll detonate it this evening at an event the whole world will be watching.
- Your crowning achievement.
- It's for both of us, Ma.
- All set?
- Set.
Very impressive.
Cool.
Cool.
America will be brought to its knees by this terrorist act.
It'll be more embarrassing to the US than Tonya Harding.
We're there.
Give my regards to Mrs. Gaddafi.
And tell her thanks for the cookies.
It's another beautiful night in LA, and the stars are shining bright for the 66th annual Academy Awards.
Fans are clamoring to see their favorite celebrities.
Here are two, "Weird Al" Yankovic and Vanna White.
Slasher, put the dame in the trunk.
I'll meet you and Ma around the back in ten minutes.
Got the passes?
- We pull this up, it's 5 million big ones.
- Not bad, Ma.
- What's going to happen to me?
- I have an idea.
- Slasher, you know what to do.
- Right.
Check the spare tire and all fluid levels.
No, keep an eye on the dame.
We hit trouble, she's a bullet shield.
Ladies and gentlemen, to present the Academy's Lifetime Achievement...
Ready, 3.
Roll tape.
Go to clip.
Aspirin, please.
Go to 3.
Ready, 4.
This year's Lifetime Achievement Award winner's credits include great films.
"Sandals and Loincloth", 1958.
"Sweaty Boatmen", 1959.
"The Leather Clad Centurion", 1960, and his first color feature in 1966, "Big Shiny Spears".
There's the man from Bryce/Porterhouse.
He guards the envelopes until they're handed out.
He won't budge from there.
Distract him so I can plant the bomb in an envelope.
Accepting the award for Mr. Bronkowitz is Margaret Red Feather.
That ought to do it.
You'll pay for this.
Rocco'll kill you whoever you are.
- Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Isn't that a little unusual?
- It happened to me.
Here's the plan.
- You'll never stop Rocco.
- Your chances are one in a million.
- Better than any state lottery.
I'm the good guy.
I can't let the bad guys win.
Our children can't be raised in fear.
If we can't stop them, they'll blow that place up.
It'll be a tragedy, unless it happens during a dance number.
Come on.
Does that radio work?
Call Police Squad.
Tell them Frank Drebin...
Forget it.
I wonder what the devil he wanted?
- Hold on.
- Sergeant Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Yeah, and I'm Robert De Niro.
- Mr. De Niro, we've got to get inside.
You and 10,000 other people.
Move along.
Movie stars only.
Come on.
I've got a better idea.
And cue talent.
To present the award for Best Supporting Actress Mariel Hemingway and Elliot Gould.
Thank you.
The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are:
Mary Lou Retton, "Fatal Affair", one woman's ordeal to overcome the death of her cat, set against the background of the Hindenburg disaster.
Morgan Fairchild, "Final Proposal", one courageous pioneer woman's triumphant victory over bulimia, set against the background of the Donner Party Crossing.
Sorry, but this is official police business.
Shannen Doherty, "Basic Analysis", one woman's triumph over a yeast infection, set against the background of the tragic Buffalo Bill season of 1991.
Thank you, sheriff.
Still no word of Frank or Rocco's gang.
I'm worried.
He should've phoned in.
Let me check your tickets.
Lovely gown.
Is that Cool Whip?
All right, Tim and Erica Brown.
OK, enjoy the show.
Let's see.
Vanna White and "Weird Al" Yankovic.
OK!
Ready, 3... and 3.
And Florence Henderson, "Analysis of a Proposal"...
- Rocco could be anywhere.
- He's had time to plant the bomb.
- And the winner is...
- This is going to be dynamite.
- Jane.
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yes.
Florence Henderson'll win.
It's about time.
- No, the bomb is in an envelope.
- You're right!
And the winner is Mary Lou Retton for "Fatal Affair".
I'm sorry, we were rooting for Florence Henderson.
We've got to get to the envelopes.
- So many.
- They added 75 categories.
"Best Actor in a Columbus movie"?
Best Director is presented by star of stage and screen Raquel Welch and host of his own award-winning talk show Phil Donahue.
That might be the envelope for the bomb.
Keep looking here.
One more second, Mr. Donahue.
Oh, my God!
Look at Donahue.
Stop the stairs, Joey.
Joey!
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to present the...
What the hell?
!
- Jesus!
- Go to commercial.
Easy now.
Talk to me.
What happened, Ma?
Slasher is Frank Drebin of Police Squad.
Lousy, two-bit copper!
I treated him like my brother... the one I didn't kill.
- He might find the bomb.
- Not if I find him first.
- Back from commercial in 5 seconds.
- Hurry up with the mike.
Cue Donahue.
Read it.
Read the card, moron.
"Well, Raquel, this certainly is a special evening.
Phew!"
"I can barely catch my breath.
Turn it over to Raquel."
"Raquel:
I'm used to being out of breath, working out to my..."
What's he doing?
!
"Hold for laughter.
To Phil.
Gets me out of breath just watching you."
- "To Raquel.
Oh, Phil..."
- I'm supposed to read that.
"Let's get to the subject at hand.
Pick up the envelope..."
The nominees for best director are:
Sir Richard Attenborough for his musical based on the life of Mother Teresa, "Mother".
Food, I love food and I'm really in the mood for a big corn dog of pooh-pooh platter two ding-dongs, it doesn't matter and some tuna helper, I'll be racing back for more
But don't get any sausage 'cause I'll blow chunks on the floor
Spike Lee, "X II
- The Merchandising"
Nordberg, look.
That's Frank at the Academy Awards.
How did he get tickets?
That's where Rocco Dillon is going to strike next, the Academy Awards.
- We have to get there.
- We're not invited.
We're cops.
- It's for you.
- Nordberg, Police Squad.
Hello.
Hello.
Henderson, see about this phone.
I think it's broke.
And now, here are today's lucky lotto numbers.
Get your tickets ready because here they come: 12, 22, 18 and 9.
And for his tale of genetics gone haywire in a retirement community,
Steven Spielberg, "Geriatric Park".
And the winner is...
- Raquel, just a second.
- Now what?
- I just had a thought.
- Oh, Christ.
This show is being seen all over the world, I was thinking if we could all send good thoughts through these cameras to men like the leader of China, Wing Wa Woo Tong, so that they might finally be nice.
Thank you.
And the winner is...
Raquel, so many go to bed hungry in this nation, yet cat food is full of tuna.
Each time I go to the zoo and see those porpoises crammed into tiny tanks,
I think, "What a waste that is."
Butcher half of them now!
That's a lot of dolphin meat that can be fed to our cats, freeing up that tuna for our nation's hungry.
- And the winner is...
- So many are cold, shivering in the night.
So I say, "Take those cats, skin them."
- "Use their fur to keep hundreds warm."
- Jesus, Phil.
And the winner is...
- You!
- Give me that!
- Not one move.
- That barrel's cold.
It's OK.
It's not the bomb.
- Jane.
Jane!
- Big trouble!
Jane.
Silver hair.
Kind of looked like Phil Donahue.
That's the guy!
Please welcome internationally renowned actress and singing star
Pia Zadora.
- Excuse me, is that snot on your shoe?
- Snot?
Where?
Oh, no.
Not him again.
Please, God.
Get off the stage!
Ed Hocken and Nordberg from Police Squad.
- We're here to prevent a disaster.
- Too late for that.
It's Frank.
Come on, Nordberg.
We've got to get to Frank.
Jane!
Jane!
I knew I'd bump into you somewhere.
I want answers, cherry cakes.
- I love you.
- Wrong answer.
I quit the Sap-of-the-Month Club long ago.
Angel drawers, you've got one last chance.
Not one of those Major-League- Baseball-Steve-Howe last chances.
- Where is Jane?
- I swear I don't know.
- Where is the bomb?
- In the Best Picture envelope.
Oh, Mr. Drebin, I want to go straight.
I'm tired of the lies.
Oh, kiss me.
Please, kiss me.
I've never kissed lips so innocent, so pure.
He looked like Phil Donahue.
White hair.
That's the guy.
To present the Best Picture Award are two very distinguished actors.
Olympia Dukakis and James Earl Jones.
- Oh, Lord.
What's that?
- Phil Donahue throwing up in a tuba.
Make a note about not having Phil Donahue back next year.
Thank you.
Good evening.
It's a privilege to present the final award of tonight's ceremony.
We've been worried about you.
Where's Rocco and Tanya?
- Sit down.
Take it easy.
- Thank God you're all right.
"Indecent Instincts" and "Sawdust and Mildew".
Oddly enough, all these movies are box office hits, except one.
- What's that?
- It's the Best Picture Award.
Olympia, would you do the honors?
Oh, my God.
That's the one!
The award for this year's best picture goes to...
- Wait!
- Oh, great.
Sorry.
Loved you in "Coneheads".
You, too.
Let me open this.
It's the bomb!
Freeze, and nobody gets hurt!
Well, from now on.
Take your seats, the party's over!
This programme's been stopped.
OK, don't panic.
Camera 2, move in on the old lady.
Better move back, 2.
- I said, "Nobody moves."
- Sit down and pay attention!
I don't want to kill anybody unless I have to.
Drop your guns and kick them over here.
I believe that bomb belongs to me.
Hand it over, Drebin.
You want to do the honors of killing him, Ma?
Blink, and I start shooting.
Give me that gun.
- Oh, my God!
- I'm not falling for that one, sister.
- Ma!
- She's a goner, Rocco.
Dead?
Then that's it.
I'm coming with you, Ma!
- Pull out the bomb, or I'll shoot her.
- All right, Rocco.
All right.
I'll do what you say.
Just don't harm her.
You pull out the bomb, you'll kill me and everyone else.
- No dice, Rocco.
- Then I'll plug her.
- If you do, I'll empty this envelope.
- Frank, think about it.
- It's all right, you'll be dead.
- You'll kill yourself and everyone here.
- Yeah.
- I'll shoot you if you don't do as I say.
- Jane?
- I'd be safe.
So would everyone else.
- But you'd be dead.
- This is getting a little complicated.
Let's be logical.
You're the psycho, you should have this and I the gun.
I know what I'm doing.
All right.
Here's your Best Picture, in front of a worldwide audience.
- This place is going up.
- If I'm going out, I'm going out happy.
Wait, Rocco, before we're all blown to bits.
Mind if I pull the underwear out of my crack?
A man's got to go comfortable.
All right, but that's it.
- Give it up, Rocco, you're history!
- Look, George Hamilton!
Come and get me.
Throw me a gun.
Get rid of the bomb.
Hold on.
Frank, help me!
- Frank!
- I know what I'm doing.
I hate heights.
Move it.
Screw the commercials!
All right, copper.
You killed my ma.
I'm taking the dame away from you.
You hear me, copper?
One push and Mrs. Drebin is linoleum.
Get a camera up there.
This could be my best work!
- Any last words before I throw you off?
- Yes, don't do it.
- Anything else?
- Frank, I love you.
I want the world to know you're the perfect man.
- Frank, I hope you can hear me.
- They told me I couldn't do drama.
I was wrong to take you away from Police Squad.
I know now that's why you couldn't perform sexually.
I realize that and a lot of other things now.
Everything's under control.
Nobody moves!
Any vibration might set this thing off.
Frank, I've learned my lesson.
Even though it may be too late for me, I want all ladies out there to remember:
Don't ever take your men for granted.
Good men don't just fall out of the sky.
He's caught up in the cable.
Frank, do something.
Hurry.
I'm coming, Ma!
- Rocco?
- Pahpshmir?
Jane, I never want us to be apart again.
Oh, Frank, you like me, you really like me.
- Frank, slow down.
- Hurry up, we're late!
- Relax.
Did you bring the camcorder?
- Right here.
- What room is she in?
- Delivery room.
This must be it.
Jane, I'm here.
Frank is here now.
- Push!
Bear down now.
- Breathe, honey.
One more push.
That's it.
Congratulations, Dad.
It's a boy.
Nordberg!
Come back here!
- Frank, it's a boy.
- I know!
Listen to me!
Killing a few hostages is not sufficient!
The Americans must be made to suffer.
We must humiliate them.
You do not go far enough, General Amin.
We must strip their entrails out and drag them to Damascus, until they include us in the peace process.
Nonsense!
This solution is not bold enough for Libya.
I say wipe out Washington and New York.
What?
And spoil three years of good PR?
The Americans believe I'm a nice guy.
In some of their polls, I'm more popular than their president!
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen!
This is getting us nowhere.
If we do nothing else this week, we must conceive at least one terrorist act that will show all the world that the United States, the great Satan, is but a paper tiger - a weak nation,
a weak people, a people ripe for destruction.
Cowards, no longer willing to fight.
I knew it!
Hey, who are you?
I'm Lieutenant Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
And don't ever let me catch you guys in America!
Watch out!
...98, 99, 100.
It's all here.
This completes our first shipment of heroin.
100% pure.
It better be - all 40 kilos.
The final shipment will be delivered in three days.
- Then we'll expect payment.
- Don't worry.'
Police!
Throw down your guns!
Kill him.
It's a great day for Americans.
This man alone...
There he is!
No flowers, thank you.
Welcome home, Frank.
Good work in Beirut.
We heard about it.
Thanks.
I want to know one thing - is it true about Victoria?
I'm afraid so.
She ran off with some guy.
They got married last week.
Then it's over.
All of this is meaningless.
I did it for her.
Everything.
And now she's gone.
And you came down here to get a hot story, didn't you?
Pictures of me to sell your newspapers.
- Frank...
- Sure, you think I'm a big hero.
Do any of you understand how a man can hurt inside?
Frank, they're not here for you.
"Weird Al" Yankovic is on the plane.
What about the wedding?
What was she wearing?
Don't torture yourself!
Put her out of your mind.
I can't get her out of my mind.
What about the guy?
- Do you know anything about him?
- Not much.
Just that he's an Olympic gymnast and it's the best sex she's ever had.
I trusted her and followed my heart.
Foolishly, it seems.
I'm just gonna have to learn to forget.
That's why I took my vacation in Beirut - to find some peace.
It won't be easy.
Everywhere I look, something reminds me of her.
Maybe cops and women just don't mix.
What about Nordberg?
I came as soon as I heard.
He's alive, but on life support.
He's got a 50/50 chance of living, though there's only a 10% chance of that.
Mrs Nordberg, I think we can save your husband's arm.
Where would you like it sent?
- Frank!
I'm so glad you came!
- Wilma, I came as soon as I heard.
Thank you, Frank.
- Where's Nordberg?
- He's right here.
Nordberg, it's Frank, your buddy.
I'll get it!
Get the switch at the back of the bed!
Nordberg, it's me, Frank.
Who did this to you?
I...
love you.
I love you, too, Nordberg.
Who were they?
- Ship...
Boat...
- That's right.
A boat.
When you're better, we'll go sailing together,
- just like last year.
- No...
Drugs.
Nurse, give this man some drugs!
Can't you see he's in pain?
- Give him a shot, quickly!
- No...
Heroin!
Heroin, Frank!
Nordberg, that's a pretty tall order.
Give me a couple of days on that one.
Oh, my poor Nordberg!
He was such a good man, Frank.
He never wanted to hurt anyone.
Who would do such a thing?
It's hard to tell.
A gang of thugs, a blackmailer, an angry husband, a gay lover...
Frank, get a hold of yourself!
A good cop - needlessly cut down by some cowardly hoodlums.
- No way for a man to die.
- You're right, Ed.
A parachute not opening - that's the way to die, getting caught in a combine, having your nuts bit off by a Laplander.
That's the way I want to go.
Frank!
This is terrible!
Don't worry, Wilma.
Your husband is gonna be all right.
Just think positive.
Never let a doubt enter your mind.
He's right, Wilma, but don't wait till the last minute to fill out those organ donor cards.
What I'm trying to say is, as soon as Nordberg is better, he's welcome back at Police Squad.
Unless he's a drooling vegetable, but that's only common sense.
Do you know why Nordberg was at the waterfront?
No...
But I found this at home in a drawer.
A photograph!
"I Luv You" out of Caracas.
A Panamanian ship.
When he said "I love you", he was telling you the name of the ship!
I realise that... now.
- We'd better check this out.
- I want every available man on it.
I can't spare anybody.
We're in charge of security for Queen Elizabeth's visit.
Wilma, whatever scum did this, no man will rest until he's behind bars.
Let's grab a bite to eat.
Due to the extraordinary efforts of some of our civic leaders,
Queen Elizabeth has included the city of Los Angeles as one of the cities she'll visit during her American tour.
Will the city hire additional security officers?
We have placed the Queen's security in the hands of Police Squad, a special division of the Police Department, represented here by Lieutenant Frank Drebin.
Thank you, Your Honour.
Louder!
- You can use my radio mic.
- Thank you.
Thank you, Your Honour.
Protecting the Queen's safety is a task that is gladly accepted by Police Squad.
No matter how silly the idea of having a queen might be to us, as Americans we must be gracious and considerate hosts.
Thank you, Lieutenant Drebin.
Of course, we all have a stake in seeing that this portion of the Queen's American tour is completely protected.
And we can take pride that the Queen...
Indeed, it is for all the people, who will be able to share in these... celebrations...
Especially exciting... will be... the Queen's...
public appearances.
We also would like...
Ed and I drove to where Nordberg had been found floating.
Without leads, you have to start somewhere, and that was the harbour.
Please disperse.
Please disperse.
There's nothing for you to see here.
Keep moving.
Where did they find him?
Out there.
Do you wanna take a dinghy?
No, I took care of that at the press conference.
It doesn't make sense.
Good policeman, bright future... then something like this happens.
He was found by the nightwatchman.
I'm gonna talk to the harbour-master.
I'll walk around and snoop.
- Yeah?
- Lieutenant Drebin, Police Squad.
I remember you.
What do you want?
I wanna ask some questions.
Are you familiar with that face?
I don't know.
My memory ain't so great.
Oh, yeah?
Maybe this'll refresh your memory.
- Still hazy.
- How about this?
I remember.
Why do you want to know?
- I can't tell you.
- Maybe this'll help.
- I don't think I should.
- Still don't think so?
- It's Nordberg, he's a cop.
- No, he was dealin' 'H'.
- What?
- He was dirty!
Scum!
I ought to run you in right now!
He worked at Ludwig's Shipping.
He tried to push something.
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Why should I tell you?
- Maybe this'll help.
- I shouldn't tell you.
Can you spot me a 20?
How about now?
I'm going down to Ludwig's office.
I'll find out if you're telling the truth.
Vincent Ludwig owned one of the city's largest corporations.
A respected business man and civic leader, he was to chair the Queen's reception committee.
Now I was about to question him about drugs and attempted murder.
- Mr Ludwig?
- Yes?
Lieutenant Drebin to see you, sir.
Show him in.
- Lieutenant.
- The feeling is mutual.
Nice to meet you, too.
Cuban?
No, Dutch-lrish.
My father was from Wales.
Sit down.
- What a magnificent office.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
Most objects I have collected over a period of many years - my Gainsborough, Ming vases.
Priceless!
They are objects which I feel reflect my personality, like the Japanese fighting fish - beautiful, graceful, elegant... yet single-minded of purpose and deadly when it finds what it wants.
This particular one is valued at over $20,000.
A luxury item, to be certain, but I am a man who appreciates the finer things in life.
Oh, this...
This is a rare Samurai pen, a gift from Emperor Hirohito.
Unbreakable.
Impervious to everything but water.
- Its value is beyond estimation.
- That's fascinating.
But I'm sure you didn't pay this visit for a lecture on fine art.
To what do I owe the honour?
I'm investigating the attempted murder of a dock worker, a man named Nordberg, a police officer.
He is still alive, then?
He was shot six times.
Fortunately, the bullets missed every vital organ.
- The salt water preserved him.
- So they...
So they got him to the hospital in time?
He's in the intensive care ward at Our Lady of the Worthless Miracle.
This certainly comes as a shock to me.
As you know, I'm not the kind of man who takes such things lightly.
There is no room in my organisation for criminal activity.
Look out there - a vast commercial development built by me.
Do you have any idea what was out there just five years ago?
You bet you do.
Orange groves!
Acres of them.
As far as the eye could see.
But now that land will generate ten times the amount of profit.
Are you all right, Lieutenant?
Let me get you some Kleenex.
Has this officer -
What's his name?
Nordberg - been able to tell you anything?
Well, he hasn't been able to tell us a thing so far, but as soon as he regains consciousness, we'll see if he can still play the guitar.
- Pardon?
- I've taken up a lot of your time.
I'd like to look at your employment records and speak to someone in Personnel.
Of course.
- Dominique, send in Miss Spencer.
- Yes, sir.
I am quite busy making arrangements for the royal visit, but I will have my assistant provide you with anything you need.
You've been very co-operative.
I'll note that in my report.
My pleasure.
Miss Spencer!
This is Lieutenant Drebin from Police Squad.
Hello...
Mr Drebin.
Hello.
Oh!
Her hair was the colour of gold in old paintings.
She had a full set of curves and the kind of legs you'd like to suck on for a day.
She gave me a look I could feel in my hip pocket.
Yep, this was starting to get interesting.
- Nice beaver.
- Thank you.
- I just had it stuffed.
- Let me help you with that.
This should be what you're looking for - the shipping and employment records for Pier 32.
Thank you.
I've heard police work is dangerous.
Yes, that's why I carry a big gun.
Couldn't it go off accidentally?
I used to have that problem.
What did you do about it?
I just think about baseball.
That's a honey of an ankle-bracelet you have there.
Did it slip down there again?
Yes, well...
I'll quickly go through these and get them back to you tomorrow.
Fine, but there's no rush.
I mean, whenever you're through.
Thank you.
I wish there was some way I could repay you.
How about dinner?
I know a place that serves great Viking food.
It's tempting, but I'm afraid I must rest this evening, tomorrow being Arbor Day.
Of course.
Perhaps some other time.
- How about a rain check?
- Let's just stick to dinner.
Thank you for your help, Miss Spencer.
My pleasure.
- Well?
- Mr Ludwig, you startled me!
I'm sorry, my dear.
Did you give the lieutenant what he wanted?
I gave him copies of the files for Pier 32.
Good.
That's good.
He is an intriguing fellow, don't you think?
Well, I don't know.
I've only just met him.
He seems very nice.
Jane, I realise this is an unusual request, but if there is something illegal going on in this company,
I need to know about it, so we can root it out.
That's why I want you to... well, to get to know Drebin a little better, find out what he knows.
Wouldn't this be best handled by the police?
We are letting the police handle it, my dear!
But we need to know the facts quickly before anything gets into the newspapers.
Don't forget, I have a responsibility to the stockholders.
Well... if you put it that way...
- Yes, I'll do my best.
- That's better.
I'm sure you will.
It was about 4pm when I returned to Police Squad.
I wanted to see what the lab had come up with on Nordberg's jacket, the one they'd found on the docks.
You can tell a lot from fibre samples if they aren't too wet.
I was hoping we wouldn't come up dry.
Hey, look out!
Police!
Halt!
Anybody catch the licence plate?
Anybody get a look at the driver?
Take the names of everybody here for questioning.
I've got to get... inside.
Hi, Ed, Ted.
You got those fibre samples yet?
- We got some action here.
- What?
We're testing our anti-graffiti wall.
We've got customers.
It reacts when the spray hits the sensors.
You've done it again - mazel tov!
Good work.
What will you think of next?
Now that you mention it, here's something we developed only yesterday.
To the casual observer - an ordinary shoe.
But in actuality...
it makes a handy weapon.
And everything a cop would need.
We call it the Swiss Army Shoe.
- Great.
And the fibre samples?
- Just one more thing.
See these cufflinks I'm wearing?
They're not just cufflinks.
Each one fires a single pin-sized dart, that knocks out your victim for a few minutes.
Let me demonstrate on Ed.
Ted!
Why?
Don't worry.
He'll be up and around in no time.
- Why don't you take a pair?
- Actually, I could use another pair.
I think you'll like them.
- Want this, chief?
- Thank you, Al.
There's something on the side of your mouth, Al.
No, no.
The other side.
As you requested, we took some fibre samples from Nordberg's jacket.
I'm afraid it doesn't look good.
- What do you mean?
- Take a look for yourself.
- I can't see anything.
- Use your open eye, Frank.
Yeah, I can see it now.
At first, it appears to be the normal cotton fibres.
But we discovered a fine white powder.
Pure heroin.
How well do you know Nordberg?
We were partners for nine years and he's my best friend.
We can't allow personal feelings to get in the way.
- Are you saying that Nordberg...?
- The Queen arrives in two days.
If the press should pick this up, it could be embarrassing for the police and the city.
I'm sorry, Frank.
I'm giving you 24 hours to clear Nordberg.
- Mr Ludwig?
- Yes?
- A Mr Pahpshmir is here.
- Show him in.
Is there something wrong, Mr Ludwig?
No, it's nothing.
- Then may we get down to business?
- Certainly.
Have a seat.
I can carry out your request.
- My price is $20 million.
- Your price is not a problem.
But there is concern on the part of those I represent, that you would be able to...
complete so difficult a task.
Tell me, Mr Pahpshmir, in all the world, who is the most effective assassin?
I would think anyone who manages to conceal his identity as an assassin.
Yes, but there is even a more ideal assassin.
One who doesn't know he is an assassin.
- Care for some tea?
- Yes, please.
Dominique, service for two, please.
I must kill Pahpshmir.
- Cream and sugar, sir?
- Mr Pahpshmir?
Cream only, please.
- There's a gun on the floor, sir!
- Just leave it.
It's all right.
- The tea, please.
- Of course, sir.
Mr Pahpshmir, have you ever seen sensory-induced hypnosis?
I think I just have.
How will she get near the target?
Oh, I doubt whether it will be her.
Good secretaries are so hard to find these days.
And it seems to me... anyone... can be an assassin.
I had 24 hours to find something to clear my friend's name.
I returned to the hospital with Ludwig's records to try to jog Nordberg's memory.
Doctor, I have the chart, if you're ready to go over it.
I'll be with you when I've finished with Mr Nordberg.
Yes, Doctor.
You'll be out of here in a couple of...
- I'd like to see Officer Nordberg.
- Sign in, please.
Wait a minute!
Where's the police guard?
- Drebin called and sent him home.
- Drebin?
I must kill Nordberg.
I must kill Nordberg.
Drebin, Police Squad!
Let go of that pillow!
Medical emergency!
Drebin, Police Squad.
Follow that black car!
The car!
Follow that car!
Stephanie, check your mirror.
Signal.
Now pull into traffic.
Try and ease off on the brake.
- Give it a little gas.
- I know a short cut.
Turn left here!
- There he is!
- Easy!
Turn right!
Follow him!
It's OK.
Normally, you would not be going 65 down the wrong way of a one-way street.
Apply the brakes.
Now put it in reverse.
- You dumb broad!
- Stephanie...
Gently extend your arm.
Extend your middle finger.
- Very good.
Well done.
- There he is!
Go for it, Stephanie!
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
All right, move on!
Nothing to see here!
Please disperse!
Nothing to see here.
Please!
The attempt on Nordberg's life left me shaken and disturbed.
The questions kept coming up again and again, like bubbles in a case of soda.
Who was this character in the hospital?
Why was he trying to kill Nordberg... and for whom?
Did Ludwig lie to me?
I didn't have any proof, but somehow, I didn't entirely trust him.
Why was the "I Luv You" not listed in Ludwig's records?
If it was, did he know about it?
If he didn't, who did?
And where the hell was I?
It was almost midnight when I got home.
I just wanted to slip under my blankets, but my night was just about to begin.
You're late.
That depends on what I'm late for.
You said we should have dinner some time.
Tonight became "some time".
I'm boiling a roast.
How hot and wet do you like it?
Very hot and awfully wet.
You seem to know your way around a kitchen.
I'm just as handy in other rooms of the house.
That shirt looks familiar.
It's yours.
I didn't want to get stained or wrinkled.
At least... not yet.
Do you mind if I slip into something more comfortable?
There.
That's better.
I hope you've brought your appetite.
I've brought everything.
Well, then, dig in.
Interesting.
Almost as interesting as the photographs I saw today.
I was young.
I needed the work.
No, they were taken at Ludwig's docks.
A ship came in, a Panamanian ship.
It wasn't on Ludwig's records.
Probably an oversight.
How is your... meat?
You be the judge of that.
Mmm...
I've got nine more.
- Have you seen that ship?
- I don't know.
It doesn't look like ours, but we deal with so many ships.
Has Officer Nordberg told you anything?
No, there's been another attempt on his life.
He's in a coma.
That's terrible!
This world is such a violent place.
If it wasn't, I'd be out of a job, but I'd give it up tomorrow to live in a world without crime.
That's beautiful.
This is all happening too fast.
- I've been hurt before.
- I'm sorry.
I'd known her for years.
We used to go to all the police functions together.
How I loved her, but she had her music.
I think she had her music.
She'd hang out with the Chicago Male Chorus and Symphony.
I don't recall her playing an instrument or being able to sing.
Yet she was on the road 300 days of the year.
I bought her a harp for Christmas.
She asked me what it was.
It's the same old story.
Boy finds girl.
Boy loses girl.
Girl finds boy.
Boy forgets girl.
Boy remembers girl.
Girl dies in a blimp accident over the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day.
- Goodyear?
- No, the worst.
Poor dear!
Now, now.
I don't want to upset you.
Frank, it's not that.
Why did you have to be so wonderful?
- There's something I must tell you.
- No!
No need to tell me anything.
What's in the past doesn't matter anyway.
Maybe...
Maybe we're just two lonely souls who have found each other.
Funny-face!
I want you to know...
I practise safe sex.
So do I.
I had a wonderful day, Frank.
I can't believe we just met yesterday.
You really mean that?
You're not just saying it, because we exchanged bodily fluids?
No, I really mean it.
You're very special.
- Can I interest you in a nightcap?
- No, thanks, I don't wear them.
Actually, I'm on stake-out tonight.
I'll be thinking about you.
I'll call you tomorrow.
OK.
Good night!
The answer's up there in Ludwig's office.
Call it what you will - a hunch, women's intuition.
Ludwig knows more than he's saying.
A hunch won't stand up in court.
Where are your hard facts?
He's the only one except us who knew Nordberg was still alive.
Next thing we know, some thug tries to knock him off.
Maybe.
But breaking into Ludwig's office is taking a big chance.
I know.
You take a chance getting up in the morning, crossing the street or sticking your face in a fan.
There he is!
Just trust me on this, Ed.
I know I'm right.
OK, but be careful.
Get some sleep.
I'll see you in the morning.
Bingo!
"20,000,000 deposited, Omani Bank, Zurich,
"upon proof of Queen's death."
Destroying property, arson... sexual assault with a concrete dildo?
!
What the hell were you doing there?
I'm sorry about that, Your Honour, but we believe Ludwig is involved in a plot to assassinate the Queen.
That's ridiculous!
Where is this "evidence"?
Well... it... burned in the f-fire.
Gentlemen,
Vincent Ludwig is one of the most respected members of this community.
If we're very nice to him, he will agree not to press charges.
- Your Honour!
- Did I make myself clear?
Yes, Your Honour.
Good day.
Drebin!
I don't want any more trouble like you had last year.
That's my policy.
When I see five weirdos dressed in togas stabbing a guy in a park,
I shoot the bastards.
That's my policy.
That was a Shakespeare in the Park production of "Julius Caesar"!
- You killed five actors!
Good ones.
- Your Honour...
Your presence at the Queen's reception tonight is not necessary.
Is that understood?
We understand, Your Honour.
Thank you.
The plane has taxied to a stop.
Any minute now we expect the doors to open and we'll get a glimpse of the Queen, as she begins her first visit to Los Angeles in five years.
It's a balmy, beautiful evening too.
She's going from here to a formal reception...
- Jane!
- Frank!
I'm just making some dinner.
Are you hungry?
Maybe just a bite.
Ludwig wanted me to ask you to meet him tonight.
There is something you should know.
I was in his place last night.
How nice!
Did he show you his Ming vases and rare oil paintings?
Jane, I think that he's involved in a number of criminal activities.
Frank, stop it!
Vincent Ludwig is a well-respected, generous, kind man.
- You don't know him like I do.
- How's that?
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I'm sorry.
I'm worried about you.
I don't trust him and I don't want you mixed up in anything dangerous.
Are Woo back in business?
They closed down three years ago.
Gee, has it been that long?
I don't feel like Chinese tonight anyway.
It's sweet of you to be concerned, but you're wrong about Vincent.
He's such a gentleman.
He's so generous.
He just wants to talk with you to clear up any doubts you might have.
- When?
- Tonight.
Meet him at the 7th Street stockyards.
All right, but promise you'll be careful.
Of course I will, funny-face, for you.
I've got to go.
See you tomorrow.
Are you sure you won't have something to eat?
Ludwig?
- Drebin?
- Yeah, I'm Drebin.
I have a message for you from Vincent Ludwig.
I'm sorry, I can't hear you!
Don't fire the gun while you're talking.
All right, put your gun down and your hands up!
Matthews, stake out that end, and card-check for anyone suspicious looking.
Frank, what are you doing here?
I've been trading shots with one of Ludwig's goons.
They're planning to do her tonight, here.
- We better be on the lookout.
- Excuse me, ma'am, security.
- What's the meaning of this?
- Relax!
Nothing will happen.
- I didn't do anything.
- Yeah?
What about this?
You think we were born yesterday?
You didn't do anything, huh?
I got rights!
Ed, he's got a picture of your wife!
Ethel!
All right, anyone else here seeing his wife?
That's all right, Frank.
Let's get in the hall.
Are you enjoying yourself, my dear?
I'm so excited to be here.
I appreciate your inviting me.
Pleasure's all mine.
Perhaps afterwards we can...
- Drebin!
- Frank!
You're both right.
Surprised to see me, Mr Ludwig?
This is not the time or place to talk.
It's way past the time we talked.
The gloves are off, I'm playing hardball.
It's fourth and fifteen, and you're looking at a full court press.
Mr Drebin!
If you have evidence, then use it.
If not, I am warning you - get off my back!
Or it will cost you dearly.
- Frank, what's wrong?
- A lot of things, sweetie-pie.
A meeting that turned into a peek-a-boo session with bullets, set up by someone who's been playing me like a violin.
Funny-face, what are you talking about?
My stockyard meeting, butter-wings.
Don't you remember setting that up?
Mr Ludwig said you'd called it off!
Believe me!
Thumb me another one, shuckie-lumps!
Frank, it's the truth!
Cops and women don't mix.
Like eating a spoonful of Drano.
It'll clean you out, but it'll leave you hollow inside.
Too bad, sugar-puff.
We could have been something.
I only did what I was told to do!
- Like make love to me?
- Frank!
That makes things easier, Princess.
To think I trusted you!
I made a big mistake.
- You can take this back.
- Whose is that?
Doesn't matter.
Take care of yourself, baby.
By the way...
I faked every orgasm.
Funny-face!
And to commemorate our friendship, the city of Los Angeles is proud to present to the Royal Family this Revolutionary War musket, donated by Mr Vincent Ludwig.
Ladies and gentlemen, Her Royal Highness,
Queen Elizabeth II!
It's disgusting the way they splash this stuff all over the newspapers!
What is journalism coming to?
You're laying on top of the Queen with her legs wrapped around you and they call that news!
They can't kick you off the Force, it's not fair.
I know.
Life isn't always fair.
Just think, the next time I shoot someone, I could be arrested.
Hey, look at that!
The missing evidence in the Kilner case!
My God, he WAS innocent!
He went to the chair two years ago, Frank.
Well... what's the use?
What good are these damn awards and citations?
Frank...
Frank, that's not your desk!
Frank!
I've been looking all over for you!
Running another errand for your boyfriend?
I tried to call last night.
I went by your place.
Where were you?
I was out walking.
All night.
Listen to me!
I have important information.
There was never anything between Vincent and me.
- He likes East German men.
- What about you?
I like cops.
- All right!
Yeah!
- Settle down.
Take it easy.
- What've you got?
- I overheard Ludwig.
You were right.
He is planning to have someone assassinate the Queen!
- Where?
- At the baseball game.
The Queen will be there as Ludwig's guest.
Is Ludwig going to shoot her in front of 60,000 fans?
No, a player, during the 7th inning stretch.
- It starts in 20 minutes.
- I'll go.
- I'll go with you.
- Stay with Ludwig
- to allay suspicion.
- OK, let's go!
Wait!
Wait!
I've gotten you into enough trouble already.
I'll go alone.
No!
This'll get you back on the Force.
We're right behind you.
Frank?
I wanted you to know now,
I've loved you since the first day I met you, and I'll never stop.
I'm a very lucky woman.
So am I.
Good afternoon.
We're coming live from the Big A, where the California Angels meet the Seattle Mariners in their showdown for the Division League.
Hello!
I'm Curt Gowdy, along with Jim Palmer,
Tim McCarver, Dick Vitale, Mel Allen,
Dick Enberg and Dr Joyce Brothers.
Join us for this all-important ball game.
And a special game it is.
As we know, it is being attended by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.
I'm sure she'll enjoy this game, Jim.
We've got all the exits covered.
I ought to arrest Ludwig right now.
No, we've got to let him make the first move.
The Mayor would have you arrested.
You've got to stay out of sight.
I've got to get that assassin.
It could be any of those players.
I've got to get down on that field and search those players.
Ladies and gentlemen, please rise and welcome
Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II!
One moment.
Over there - these seats are taken.
My dear, is something bothering you?
No, why do you ask?
You haven't said a word.
You seem... nervous.
Well, you know how important this game is for the Angels.
Why he not here now?
I do not like to wait for him.
Mr Pallazzo, our head usher will be here in two minutes.
Please wait.
- He should be here now!
- I'll send him right over.
I do not wait for him!
He waits for me!
- Yes?
- Mr Pallazzo?
I am the head usher.
I am here to...
Excuse me.
- Mr Pallazzo?
- Yes?
- I am the head usher.
- One second.
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the California Angels and the City of Los Angeles, on the occasion of the royal visit, please welcome internationally-renowned opera star,
Enrico Pallazzo!
Ladies and gentlemen, let us honour America, as Mr Pallazzo will now sing our national anthem.
And now we'll wait for the exchange of line-ups and the start of today's ball game.
Excuse me, could you tell me, is this an official bat?
The Queen's visit has brought a sell-out crowd!
And the fans are being entertained by the stadium's Angel Vision, showing some unusual moments in baseball over the years!
Sorry, fellas!
How about that?
Ladies and gentlemen, now taking the field - your California Angels!
For everybody's safety, we ask that you do not throw any objects on the field.
We thank you for your co-operation.
As the Angels take the field, we're ready for the first pitch ceremony with the Queen of England ready to toss out the first ball.
How about that?
Let's have a round of applause!
We're ready for the start, as these lovely ladies would agree.
Those are the players' wives, here to enjoy the game.
What d'you say, Cummings?
Are we gonna do this today?
Do what?
Play ball!
Frank!
Al, it's Frank!
The game's under way.
Dave Spiwack ready to face Jay Johnstone!
- Nothing to report.
- Don't worry, Al.
If one of the players is the killer, Frank'll find him, even if he has to search every one of them.
...lead-off hitter Jay Johnstone.
Hello, pal.
Let's see if that uniform's on straight.
Good here.
Now let's see the shirt.
You should take a large.
It's a little tight in the crotch.
All right?
All set?
OK, play ball!
Strike?
Yeah, strike!
Stee-rike two!
Stee-rike three!
You're clean!
Have you found him yet?
No, and I've searched almost everybody.
Yeah.
There's only one more out before the seventh inning stretch.
You're going to have to stall them.
Don't let 'em get that third out.
Right.
The Mariners' number four - Armando Criscione!
Criscione!
- Ball!
- Ball?
Ball!
Get... get... what the...?
Get off!
Catch it!
Catch it!
- Get 'em off!
- Go, go, go!
- Safe!
- What do you mean, safe?
I don't believe it!
Second base!
On two!
There's a throw by the catcher and now they've got Criscione hung up between 1st and 2nd!
What the hell are you doing?
What?
- You're not supposed to do that!
- Wait a minute!
Stop that!
Put that back down!
Give me the ball!
I'll get you!
It's hard to believe, but apparently the umpires have got Criscione in a run-down!
- Safe!
- Safe?
How about that?
- Out!
- Safe!
- Out!
- He was safe!
- Out!
- Safe!
There's a sight I've never seen!
- Safe!
- What are you doing?
Safe!
Safe!
Safe!
- He was out!
- He was safe!
You idiot!
He was out!
All right, you're out of here!
- What?
- You can't throw an umpire out!
All right, YOU'RE out!
Hold on!
Even the guy running the scoreboard says he was out!
And he's up in the mezzanine!
It's the third out!
I must kill... the Queen.
I must kill... the Queen.
Frank, it's the right-fielder!
- You're the boss!
- It was safe.
Now, we're going to take a walk.
How could you do something so vicious?
It was easy.
Don't forget I spent two years as a building contractor.
Now, let's go quietly.
Hey, look at that!
Let's get him!
Kick him in the balls!
I must kill... the Queen.
Look out!
The umpire...
He saved the Queen's life!
That's not the umpire, Your Honour.
Hey, it's Enrico Pallazzo!
Frank!
Frank, help!
Frank!
Frank, help!
Frank!
Hold it, Ludwig!
Stay where you are!
- He's got a gun!
- I know.
You ruined my life.
Now I'm going to ruin yours.
- Leave the girl alone!
- I am.
I'm going to kill you.
I see.
Two can play at that game!
- You killed him!
- No, just stunned.
He'll be all right.
Well...
Frank... it's horrible!
- It's so horrible!
- I know, Ed.
My father went the same way.
I must kill...
Frank Drebin.
I must kill...
Frank Drebin.
No, no, don't shoot!
Jane... it's me...
Funny-face.
I must kill Frank Drebin.
You love Frank Drebin.
And Frank Drebin loves you.
Jane, if you don't love me, you might as well pull that trigger, because without you, I wouldn't want to live anyway.
I've finally found someone I can love - a good, clean love...
without utensils.
I must kill Frank Drebin.
It's a topsy-turvy world, Jane, and maybe the problems of two people don't amount to a hill of beans, but this is our hill and these are our beans.
Since I met you, I've noticed things I never knew where there - birds singing, dew glistening on a newly-formed leaf, stop lights...
I must kill...
Jane, this morning...
I bought something for you.
It's not very much, but pretty good for an honest policeman's salary.
It's an engagement ring.
I'd have given it to you earlier, but I wanted to wait until we were alone.
- I...
- I love you, Jane.
Oh, Frank!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry that I yelled at you yesterday, I really am.
Drebin!
I was wrong about you.
This city and the whole world owes you a debt of gratitude.
Thank you.
And Monday morning we want you back at Police Squad...
- with a promotion to captain.
- Mayor...
Don't thank me.
There's someone else here who wants to thank you.
- Nordberg!
- Hiya, buddy!
The doc says I should be on my feet in a week!
- And back on the Force!
- Nordberg, that's wonderful!
Frank!
Everyone should have a friend like you!

WOMAN:
Hey, look!
It's the President!
And the Pope!
Yee-aah!
Yah!
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la!
MAN:
Oh, my God!
Look!
It's disgruntled postal workers!
Wait a minute!
Give me my baby back!
Aah!
Aah!
- Frank!
Are you all right?
- I'm soaking wet.
- I'll get the talcum powder.
- No, I had a nightmare.
There was crime all around me.
I couldn't stop it.
- It was just a dream.
- You're right.
All I need is a good rest.
In the morning everything'll be fine.
How's my little boy?
Getting along okay, sweetie?
As well as a heterosexual can in prison.
I don't know how much longer I can take it.
- How's Tanya?
- Tanya's the same.
Milky, creamy skin, pouting red lips, firm buttocks, ample breasts, ears you want to stick your tongue into.
Ma!
I'll get guy cramps!
Sorry.
Rocco, there's somebody here to see you.
Papshmir.
My people are very upset.
They're always upset.
They're Arab terrorists.
Ma, please.
You're supposed to be the best terrorist bomber in the world.
Stations, stores, government buildings...
The devastation in Florida.
- That was Hurricane Andrew.
- That's what they told the public.
We wanted to embarrass the United States, and you made the police look like international heroes.
A first-class job costs 5 million.
If you want to step up to the price,
I got a target that'll make City Hall look like chicken feed.
That's a big target, but why should I think anything would be different?
$5 million buys me.
- I'm breaking out of here.
- All right, but fail this time and my people won't be so forgiving.
Fail?
Show me one man who can stop me.
I used to be a renegade
I used to fool around
But I couldn't take the punishment
I had to settle down
Now I'm playing it real straight
And yes, I cut my hair...
PA:
Attention shoppers.
Be sure to check out our special on aisle 7.
It's hip to be square...
PA:
That's aisle 7.
Hey!
Give it to me!
LADY:
My purse!
Somebody help me!
THIEF:
I want the purse, lady.
LADY:
Help me!
He's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny
Hear!
Hear!
Well, we shot a lot of people together.
It's been great.
But today I retire, so if I do any shooting now, it'll have to be within the confines of my own home.
Hopefully, an intruder and not an in-law, like at my bachelor party.
Well, Ed.
- I officially give you my gun.
- Aw...
And my badge.
And...
Jane and I would like to keep the handcuffs as a souvenir.
- Oh, gee...
- Cheer up, Ed.
This is not goodbye.
It's just I won't ever see you again.
Oh, Frank.
LADY:
My purse!
Somebody help me!
THIEF:
Out of the way.
Lieutenant Drebin!
Frank!
Didn't you see that?
What?
Oh, yes.
Kitty litter.
Two bags for a dollar.
Great.
Order.
The jury will disregard that statement.
Continue, Counsellor.
Alimony had been set by the court.
Right, Mr Clayton?
Yes, but...
But not once have you paid alimony to my client, repeatedly defying a court order.
I lost her address.
She moved twice, I couldn't keep up.
Don't lie to me.
You're under oath.
Do you know the penalty for perjury?
I'll ask that again.
Objection!
Your Honour, I... ow, ow.
Jeez!
- Counsel is leading the witness.
- Sustained.
Sweetie, Mommy said no pounding when she's in session.
Please read the prosecution's last statement.
"Don't lie to me.
You're under oath."
There.
"Do you know the penalty for perjury?"
That's all I have, Your Honour.
You may continue, Ms Spencer-Drebin.
Er... prosecution rests.
Defence, Ms Davis-Jacob-Steiner-Laszlo?
No further questions, Your Honour.
Court will recess until after the morning feed.
We're gonna win this.
I can feel it.
Yes.
Of course.
I married the wrong man.
I never thought that was possible.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, nothing.
Louise, there's no such thing as the wrong man.
You just have to work at it.
Now, let's see.
Mr and Mrs Drebin, right?
Now, you two have been married for six months?
Yes.
We really appreciate you seeing us, Doctor.
You were recommended by our last therapist.
Yes, I was sorry to hear about his suicide.
You know, I feel it's important to get off on the right foot and not get caught up in blame.
Now, which one of you is impotent?
- That would be him.
- Yes, of course.
- Why don't you ask who's frigid?
- That would be him, also.
- How do you know?
You're never home.
- He resents that I work.
He has no idea what a woman wants.
You're so insensitive.
- Is this the toilet seat thing?
- It's babies, Frank.
I want to have a baby.
Whenever we make love, you get a headache.
I'm not a piece of meat, Jane.
I'm trying.
I've got ointments, lotions, creams, books, things that vibrate.
- Frank!
- Maybe it's your fault.
Have you tried sexy lingerie?
Some lacy underwear, a black teddy?
I've worn them all.
They don't work.
Oh.
Why don't you want a child?
Didn't I try to adopt that 18-year-old Korean girl?
Jane, Frank, here's what I suggest.
Make tonight a special night.
Dinner, wine, romantic music.
Put on the 24-hour Johnny Mathis station.
Just be Jane and Frank, lovers.
We haven't had a night like that in a long time.
- Not together.
- Frank?
Jane...
Having a baby is a big responsibility.
It's like being in charge of sanitation at a Haitian jail.
I'm just frightened.
Frank, let's make tonight something special.
Oh, honey, it's just that I love you so much.
My little lover sparrow.
My puppy-wuppy wover.
My little love biscuit.
My little shnooky-wookums.
My little lady cheesy puppy.
Mr and Mrs Drebin, please.
I'm diabetic.
I think you should go now.
I never thought we'd end this way.
How did you think we'd end?
I don't know.
Some other way.
Oh, Jason.
Ed!
Nordberg!
It's been a long time.
Hiya, Frank!
You look terrific!
Thank you.
The little woman got me a Thighmaster.
Where are my manners?
Come on in.
How charming!
Sit, sit.
Excuse the mess.
It's my ironing day.
I just frosted some cupcakes.
- Would you care for one?
- Oh, not just now.
Frank, we have a problem with a terrorist threat.
- Police Squad is certain...
- I'd love a cupcake.
- That coffee smells great.
- I grind my own beans.
Frank, the reason we're here is that we need your help.
It's great!
I hoped you'd like them.
Made them from scratch.
I'll just get off my feet.
We may have a lead on a suspect in the City Hall bombing attempt.
These were taken by a news photographer.
- This girl was the diversion.
- We had them enlarged.
They look familiar.
No, the pin, she's a nurse.
Can I keep this one?
We traced her to the Karlson Clinic on Myrtlewood.
- She's Tanya Peters.
- Tanya Peters?
- You know her?
- Don't you remember in the 1970s?
The big disco shoot-out.
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
The music loud, the women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
But it's all right, I'm OK
You may look the other way
We can try to understand...
Ed, what's happening, my man?
Frank, we missed you last night at the fondue party.
I went to see the Village People.
They're a stone soul gas, man.
- I can dig it.
- What have we got here?
One dead disco dancer.
Bummer.
What a mindbender, huh?
We think it was a love triangle.
This is the suspect's girlfriend, Tanya Peters.
Cigarette?
Yes, I know.
Well, we'll need a statement from you down at the station.
Nordberg!
Coming, Lieutenant!
I do remember.
You were one of the first test cases for minoxidil, weren't you?
- What?
- I'm glad I could help.
Now, I've got some lamb to put in the oven.
We need a favour.
It's not that big a roast, Nordberg.
No, not that, Frank.
We need you to go undercover at the clinic.
Whoa!
I've given up police work, Ed.
You're whistling up the wrong neck of the woods.
- We're in a bind, Frank.
- What about Hedges and O'Malley?
They're in Hawaii.
Together.
Well, I can't.
Jane and I have a special evening planned.
You'll be home in time to make dinner.
I'd have to make pork chops.
Frank, think of all the crime out there.
Nobody is safe.
You'd be protecting Jane.
You'd be protecting all the Janes of the world.
And you haven't shot anybody in months.
That's true.
Funny how you miss the little things.
Might be good to feel that cold, hard steel pressed against my thigh once again.
The thrill of the chase, to be a man.
After folding the laundry, I went to the Karlson Clinic.
It's always important to have a disguise and this operation was no different.
I had no idea if Tanya would recognise me, so I slipped on a fake pair of glasses and combed my hair differently.
The plan was to get in, get information about Tanya's link with the bombing, and get out as quickly as possible.
I figured faking an old football injury would do the trick.
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see a doctor, please.
Sign in here, please.
- Do you have an appointment, Mr...
- Er, Smith.
No, I don't.
Take a number.
Six.
- What?
- Is six taken?
Does it have to be between 1 and 10?
You'll be called.
Thank you.
Mr Smith?
We've had a cancellation.
We can take you now.
Good morning, Mr Smith.
This way.
I really appreciate your seeing me like this.
I'm sure it won't take too long.
When did you notice the problem?
Uh, in the back yard with my uncle.
In the back yard with your uncle?
Yes.
When he comes over to visit, we like to go in the back yard, throw it around for a while.
What did you and your uncle find out?
I can't keep up with him.
Mine hurt, especially on the long ones.
I can't seem to straighten it out.
It has no feeling.
It's kind of numb.
I may have yanked it too much.
- If you would.
- For what?
- A sperm count.
- In here?
It's not exactly the back yard, but it'll do.
Well...
Follow me, and we'll do the necessary paperwork.
Sign these at the bottom and leave them with the nurse.
- This way, please.
- What?
- Number 17.
- Oh, no.
- A problem?
- No, no.
- This is 17.
- Have we met before?
If you'll excuse me, I'm next.
Ooh!
Aah!
Agh!
Eurgh!
- Sir?
- Aah!
Mr Smith, how are we doing?
I've been busy.
- Do you want a videotape to help?
- Do you have Dances With Wolves?
Rocketeer?
Lady And The Tramp?
An adult movie.
Hmm...
Ooh!
Aah!
Yeow!
The tape was very entertaining.
Follow me.
Do you have Spartacus?
PA:
Maintenance.
Clean-up, room 7.
Maintenance.
Clean-up, room 7.
Stat.
- What are you doing?
- Just freshening up.
You should look your best even though you're by yourself.
Are you sure we've never met?
Here's my cup.
Back to work.
- Knocking.
- Mr Smith?
- Are you okay in there?
- I could use a little help.
PA:
Dr Rosenblatt, foreplay in room 7, please.
Dr Rosenblatt.
Honey, I've been waiting all day.
I'm wearing the nightgown you bought me for our honeymoon.
Tonight's going to be special.
I'm going to make love to you for hours and hours.
Wouldn't Mr Happy like that?
- Hours?
- Like our first time together.
Jane, why don't I soak in the tub for a couple of days?
Possibly a week.
You're so cute.
Let me go get the oysters and clams.
Walk my way
And a thousand violins
Begin to play
Or it might be the sound
Of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty
The moment you're near
You can say
That you're leading me on...
Here.
I'll shave your back like last time.
Jane, I really don't think we should.
I...
Frank!
What's this?
I fell on a rake.
You're lying.
Now I know why Ed's been calling.
- You're back on a case, aren't you?
- No, I swear.
It's another woman!
In your wildest dreams!
It's bad enough not having a baby, but I warned you about Police Squad, you white Anglo male!
Jane!
Ah!
Jane!
It was nothing, Jane.
I was doing Ed a small favour!
Some retirement.
I'm leaving, Frank.
I never thought you'd go back on your word.
- Aren't you being hasty?
- I don't think so.
That's my cab.
I'll be at Louise's.
Oh, Frank, how could you?
We need time apart to think about us.
I'm not going to think.
Why start now?
I love you.
Look, baby, I am what I am and I do what I do.
A few guys make shoelaces, some lay sod, some make a living neutering animals.
- I'm a cop.
- Pretty speech, Frank.
But my mind is made up.
I'm leaving.
All right.
Then take this with you.
You know how my lips feel about things.
Goodbye, Frank.
RADIO:
You're listening to KSAD, all-depressing, all the time.
Here's a dedication to Frank from Jane, who just called from a taxi.
"Frank, you lying weasel-weenie."
"First you shoot blanks, now you're letting all the heat out..."
He said he'd never go back to police work.
Once a cop, always a cop.
- He's married to his work.
- You'll always come in second.
There was an article in Cosmo, "Why all men are pigs".
"Frank" is just another word for loser.
I never want to see him again.
I want to get as far away as possible.
We'll go to my friend's cabin by the smelting plant.
The fresh air will do you good.
Go easy.
That's your second bottle of Chanel.
You're witnessing the beginning of a new Jane Spencer-Drebin.
No more little miss perky, devoting her life to one man.
I'm out for the new me.
Let's burn rubber.
- Didn't forget anything, did you?
- I hope not.
Just calm down, ma'am.
How many bodies did you find in your pool?
Sir, killing a gang member's only an $18 fine.
Just mail it in.
Frank!
Glad you could make it!
- Welcome, buddy.
- Nordberg.
Did you find Tanya's address, Frank?
I wrote it on a hanky, and I can't remember what I did with it.
- I'm getting a bit rusty.
- It could happen to anybody.
I brought you some of Frank's never-fail fudge!
You go on about your business.
I'll stay out of your hair.
It'll be...
Frank, let me take that.
We've got a surprise for you.
It's in honour of your 30 years on the force.
Nordberg.
Oh, boy.
This is really great.
Thank you, guys.
We thought it might cheer you up.
We heard about you and Jane.
Jane, Jane.
That name will always remind me of her.
Frank, I feel really bad about all of this.
If there's anything you need.
Dr Kevorkian's home phone number?
Nordberg, put it together.
- Frank, you know we're here for you.
- Thanks, Ed.
Well, look who's here.
Hi, Frank.
Nice to see you.
- I've got that data on the bomb.
- What did you find out?
The explosive is a very fine powder.
- It tastes like...
- That's fertiliser.
Another case.
This is what I'm talking about.
We detected a high quantity of nitroglycerine.
- Can you tell us where it came from?
- I'd be glad to.
Billions of years ago, the Earth was a molten mass...
Ted, I'm talking about the powder.
We don't know about that.
Let me take that urine specimen.
We found a list of the bomber's plans at the scene.
On a hunch, we analysed the paper.
- And you got something?
- Yes.
The paper's from Statesville Prison.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
We analysed the wood fibres and found them to be from the rare Canary Island pine, which grows only in Oregon.
Contacting paper mills in that area led us to a distribution centre in Tacoma.
Unfortunately, the trail ended there.
- How'd you trace it to the prison?
- Right here on the letterhead.
After comparing handwriting of every known bomber serving a stretch in Statesville, we came up with a suspect.
Rocco Dillon.
He's masterminding the bombings from inside the prison.
There's only one way to find out where Rocco will strike next.
We have to send someone in there.
- I'll do it.
- I wouldn't feel right about that.
If Rocco thinks you're a cop, you might end up dead.
"You might end up dead" is my middle name.
What about Jane?
I don't know her middle name.
I need the action.
I'm going inside the big house.
Frank, Ed.
I think you might want to see this.
We're testing out a prototype for an anti-carjacking device.
We'll see how it works.
Get out!
Don't make me...
Argh!
We call it the Denver jockstrap.
After being retired for six months, I was finally back in action.
Faster than saying "spread 'em", I was in Statesville Prison.
I was surrounded by pimps, rapists and murderers.
It was like being in the stands at an LA Raiders game.
It was going to take all my police experience just to stay alive here.
After a long and generous cavity search,
I reached my destination, Maximum Security, home of some of the most violent sociopaths in the country.
And the worst of them all, Rocco Dillon.
GUARD:
All right, in here.
Ain't no prison yet could hold me.
Attica!
Attica!
Power to the brothers!
Kill whitey!
Kill whitey!
PRISONER:
Knock it off!
You're chirping loud for a new canary.
Keep flashing the big eyes and I'll rotate your jaw.
Hey!
You know who you talking to?
The man is Rocco Dillon.
- Where's your prison number?
- It's unlisted.
Just call me Nick "The Slasher" McGirk.
Look, I'm the muscle in this pen.
Just stay out of my way.
You just watch your step, McGirk.
Take it from me, this place changes a man.
Yeah?
How?
I used to be white.
I was the drummer for the Osmonds.
Screw with me, he'll make you feel pain like never before.
I know.
I remember the Osmonds.
- Better hit the rack, McGirk.
- In a minute.
First I'm gonna make a list of who I'm gonna kill in the next few days.
GUARD:
Lights out.
Lockdown in two minutes.
My dearest snooky wookums dumpling buns,
I miss you so much.
I haven't hurt this bad since the last time I was dumped.
I remember it well.
Her name was Gabriella.
We were supposed to be married, but on the day of our wedding, she never showed up.
I was heartbroken.
I figured she had fallen for another man, someone who could do to her what I never could.
I thought my life was over until that one glorious day.
That was the day you became my wife.
Our friends gathered to celebrate our love.
It seems like only yesterday.
We were all so overjoyed.
I remember wishing we could take everyone with us.
That was the happiest day of my life.
I remember the plans we made.
Things were going to be so perfect.
We got that housekeeper you always wanted.
Hi, Mr D. Hi, Mrs D.
And I knew that eventually our dream would come true.
One day we'd have our own Frank Drebin Jr.
ROCCO:
Shut up.
I'm trying to get some sleep.
Nah, it's no use.
She'll never come back.
You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will, but what a thrill
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
I laughed at love cos I thought it was funny
You came along and moved me, honey
I changed my mind, this love is fine
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!
Bend over and pick it up for me, would you, lover?
No problem.
Rocco could tell from my escapade in the shower that I was well-endowed with courage.
Now I had to get on the inside.
Like a blind man at an orgy, I was going to have to feel things out.
Tyrone, I got the escape plans right here.
Just you and me.
- Burnett wants in.
- Burnett's one of the guards!
I know, but he's unhappy here.
All right, all right.
Whatever.
Got it all worked out right here.
What's this?
Another letter from your mommy?
- That's private!
- Let's see what we have.
- Give the man back his letter.
- Buzz off, butter cheeks.
What's so special about a little letter?
Wait a minute.
An escape plan!
This is your ticket to another 20 years, Dillon.
If the warden gets one look at this...
Hey!
You call this slop?
Real slop has got chunks in it!
This is more like gruel!
And this Chateau le Blanc '68 is supposed to be served slightly chilled!
This is room temperature!
What do you think we are, animals?
ALL:
No!
What are we?
Homo sapiens?
You're right!
We are men!
We are men!
ALL:
We are men!
We are men!
Left hand blue.
Whose hand is that?
Come on, son.
You can do it.
Eat some beans!
You saved my bacon, McGirk.
I'd be in solitary if you hadn't done that.
I've been watching you.
You handle yourself good.
- "Really well".
- Whatever.
I got something big on the outside.
I could use you in my gang.
- Dental plan?
- Full coverage.
- What's the caper?
- First we bust out.
Thanks to you, we still have our escape plan.
Let's have it.
- It's a good plan.
- I've had better.
Listen, I've got a fool-proof plan.
They got Tyrone.
Can't...
Can't we all just get along?
Now that Tyrone was in solitary, it was just me and Rocco.
He had to trust me.
'Shh!
Hold on.
Okay.
I convinced Rocco to dig a tunnel.
It was that or go out in a laundry truck.
The thought of lying nose down in skid marks didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.
Disposing of the dirt was a problem I solved early in the construction.
Apart from some chafing, we made good progress.
We kept digging.
Dummies gave the impression we were still in our cell.
GUARD:
Lights out.
There was more dirt than I thought.
Disposing of it was becoming tricky.
Safe!
Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall
If one of those bottles should happen to fall
Ninety-eight bottles of beer on the wall
Ninety-eight bottles of beer on the wall...
Where are you going?
- Are you thinking of Frank again?
- They're playing our song.
I understand.
Take your time.
- Hello there.
- Excuse me.
I'm hauling a load of rice cakes to Big D. Coming with me?
No.
- How about a kiss?
- No.
When a woman says no, she means yes.
- How about that kiss?
- Yes.
No?
I know your type.
Come on, baby.
We're two of a kind.
Oh, my God!
You killed him!
It was an accident.
Call the police.
Come to your senses.
You killed a man.
You're a hero to every woman.
We have to call Frank.
He'll protect us.
Frank is a man.
He'll see you locked away forever.
Jane, I want to join you, to help you kill as many men as possible.
Yipes!
Louise, do what you have to do.
I'm calling Frank.
TRUCKER:
Oh, boy, did that hurt.
Be home, Frank.
Answer the phone.
Frank!
ANSWERPHONE:
Hi, this is Frank.
And Jane.
BOTH:
We're the Drebins.
We're not home right now so leave a message!
FRANK:
Which button is it?
JANE:
Not that one!
"Tanya"?
It was another woman.
Frank wasn't lying.
"Honeymoon Bay Road." I bet they're alone there now!
Frank!
Cell inspection.
There's been a rumour of a possible breakout.
If we suspect anyone of attempting to escape, they will be punished severely.
Once word of the escape was out, we headed for the tunnel.
The last few feet were dug on the run.
Another 47 yards would take us beyond the prison walls.
May he rest in peace, in the arms of our...
Jesus Christ!
ALL:
Amen.
FRANK:
Rocco had arranged for a car to meet us.
After making a slight adjustment we arrived at the rendezvous point, a Los Angeles city high school.
Hey, that was close.
Hey, Rocco, who's the old hag?
She take one in the face?
She's my mother.
Mrs Dillon.
Your son is a ruthless, sadistic, cold-blooded animal.
- You must be proud of him.
- I am.
I want you to meet a real square egg, Nick "The Slasher" McGirk.
There's fresh clothes in the back.
Rocco's mom was quiet.
I felt she didn't care for me coming along.
Like a midget at a urinal, I was going to have to stay on my toes.
Hey!
Stop!
Oh, Frank.
It wasn't my fault.
That cow shouldn't have been in the road.
Hurry up.
You're letting the flies in.
- What do you think?
- Great setup.
No phone, miles from the nearest town, Playboy channel.
Perfect.
Nice digs.
But I'm here for the action.
What is it?
Bank, armoured car, payroll?
You're getting a little bit too nosy, McGirk.
Relax, Ma.
- She's itching to use her new gun.
- I know the feeling.
It was Tanya.
That bathing suit was never happier.
I had only a second to admire the view.
I had to watch out.
If she made me as a cop, I'd be tonight's meat loaf.
Come here, sexy.
You're all woman.
I could tell by looking at you.
Hey, she's referring to me.
I was talking about your mother.
MOTHER:
That's no way to be walking around.
Get some clothes on.
And what are you doing in my bathing suit?
Hey, who's the stud?
Meet the newest member of our gang.
Slasher McGirk, meet Tanya Peters.
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
I smelled cop on him the minute I saw him.
I get it all the time.
It's the underwear ads.
- Are you saying you're not a cop?
- Well, yeah.
- That's good enough for me.
- Me, too.
All right.
I'm glad that's all cleared up.
Ma, why not kiss and make up?
Well, all right.
Now that's more like it.
Uh!
Ow.
FRANK:
I had to get a message to Police Squad.
This was more than I could handle.
No phone, miles from civilisation, my prospects look bleaker than a gerbil's in a bathhouse.
Who's down there?
Slasher.
Have you seen my pigeon?
- Pigeon?
What pigeon?
- What are you doing?
I'm just contemplating my next move.
Your bishop is exposed.
It's these pants.
I usually wear a fuller cut.
You're all man.
I like that in my men.
You're coming on to me big-time, sister, but we got a problem.
- You're Jewish?
- No.
You're Rocco's girl.
In my book, that chapter's called "Look, But Don't Touch".
I could have two lovers.
Kinky.
But I like my sex the way I play basketball, one-on-one, with as little dribbling as possible.
Oh, you're tense, Slasher.
Well, I could relax more if I knew about tomorrow.
You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
All I know is it's downtown and big.
That's the way I like it.
- What else?
- Just this.
What are you doing?
Thank you for the advice.
I'll try that recipe, Miss Peters.
How could you?
Just shove your tongue in as far as you can.
Oh!
Quiet.
You don't know me here.
That's a goodbye kiss, sister.
What's all this?
Who's the skirt?
Just some dizzy dame.
Probably broke down.
I'll take her to the bus depot.
Hey, she's married.
What if her husband comes looking?
- He must be a great guy.
- He breaks promises.
Look at you, traipsing all over, just to spite him.
- He left me.
- You left him.
- You should talk.
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you!
- Listen to you!
Jeez, you two, knock it off!
- You'd think you're married!
- What'll we do with her?
One thing's for sure.
There's no room for her here.
- I say we bump her off.
- Let's plug her here.
I've been on a job where I'd have given my eye teeth for a hostage.
We know women make the best hostages.
They're small, easy to move, eat less, smell nice.
Yeah, we got us an insurance policy.
Good thinking, kid.
Now, let's get some shuteye.
We got a big day ahead of us.
All right, it's rigged.
Watch the tower, Slasher.
This is what'll happen tonight.
Hey, aren't we far away?
Oh!
ROCCO:
All right, pay attention.
On that tower's a device that's gonna net us 5 million bucks.
We're gonna detonate it this evening at an event that the whole world will be watching.
- Your crowning achievement.
- It's for both of us, Ma.
All set!
Set!
Very impressive.
Heh-heh-heh-heh.
Cool.
America will be brought to its knees by this terrorist act.
This will be more embarrassing to the US than Tonya Harding.
We're almost there.
I don't wanna miss this.
Regards to Mrs Qaddafi.
Tell her thanks for the cookies.
PA:
It's a beautiful night in Los Angeles, and the stars are shining bright for the 66th Academy Awards.
Fans are clamouring to see their favourite celebrities.
It's Weird Al Yankovic and Vanna White.
Put the dame in the trunk.
I'll meet you and Ma round back in 10 minutes.
Got the passes?
If we pull this off, it's 5 million big ones.
Not bad!
- What's going to happen to me?
- I have an idea.
Right, Slasher.
You know what to do.
Check the tyres and fluid levels.
No, you muffin head, the dame.
We hit trouble, she's a bullet shield.
PA:
Ladies and gentlemen, to present the lifetime achievement award...
Roll tape.
Go to clip.
Aspirin, please.
Go to three.
Ready, four.
This year's lifetime achievement award winner's credits include some of the greatest moments on celluloid.
Films such as Sandals And Loincloth, 1958,
Sweaty Boatmen, 1959,
The Leather-clad Centurion, 1960, and his first colour feature in 1966,
Big Shiny Spears.
Okay, there's the man from Bryce Porterhouse.
He guards the envelopes until they're handed out.
He won't budge.
You know what to do.
Distract him so I can plant the bomb.
PA:
Accepting the award for Mr Broncowitz is Margaret Redfeather.
That ought to do it.
You'll never get away with this.
Rocco will kill you, whoever you are.
Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Isn't that a unusual?
- It's happened before.
- Here's the plan.
- You'll never stop Rocco.
- Your chances are one in a million.
- Better than any state lottery.
I'm the good guy.
I can't let the bad guys win.
Our children can't be raised in fear.
They're going to blow that place sky high.
It'll be a tragedy.
Unless it's during a dance number.
Come on.
Does that radio work?
Call Police Squad.
Tell them Frank Drebin...
Forget it.
I wonder what the devil he wanted?
- Hold on.
- Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Yeah, and I'm Robert de Niro.
- Mr de Niro, we must get inside.
You and 10,000 other people.
Move along.
- Movie stars only.
- Come on.
I've got a better idea.
Cue talent.
PA:
To present the award for best supporting actress,
Mariel Hemingway and Elliott Gould.
Thank you.

Thank you, Sheriff.
Still no word of Frank or Rocco's gang.
I'm worried.
He should have called by now.
Let me just check your tickets.
- Lovely gown.
Is that Cool Whip?
- Uh-huh.
Tim and Erica Brown.
Okay, enjoy the show.
Let's see, Vanna White and Weird Al Yankovic.
Okay, enjoy the awards.
And three.
And Florence Henderson, Analysis Of A Proposal.
- Rocco could be anywhere.
- Where could the bomb be?
- The winner is...
- This is going to be dynamite.
- Jane!
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
FRANK:
Florence Henderson is going to win!
- No!
The bomb's in the envelope.
- You're right!
And the winner is...
Argh!
Mary Lou Retton for Fatal Affair.
Yes!
Yes!
Sorry.
We were rooting for Florence Henderson.
We must get those envelopes before they open any more.
Yes!
I never realised there'd be so many.
They added 75 new categories.
"Best actor in a Columbus movie"?
PA:
To present the award for best director,
Raquel Welch and the host of his own talk show, Phil Donahue.
That might be the envelope with the bomb.
Keep looking.
One more second, Mr Donahue.
Oh, my God!
Look at Donahue!
DIRECTOR:
Stop the stairs, Joey!
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to present...
What the hell?
- RAQUEL:
Jesus!
- Go to commercial.
Easy, now.
Talk to me.
What happened, Ma?
Slasher is Frank Drebin of Police Squad.
That lousy, two-bit, copper punk!
I treat him like my brother, the one I didn't kill.
- He might find the bomb.
- Not if I find him first.
PA:
Back from commercial in five seconds.
Hurry with the mike and cue Donahue.
Read the card, moron.
"Well, Raquel, this certainly is a special evening.
Phew!"
"I can barely catch my breath.
Turn it over to Raquel."
"I'm used to being out of breath..."
What the hell?
"Hold for laughter and applause.
To Phil."
"Gets me out of breath just watching.
To Raquel..."
I read that.
"But let's get to the subject at hand.
Pick up the envelope."
The nominees for best director are...
Sir Richard Attenborough for his musical on the life of Mother Teresa, Mother.
Food!
I love food
And I'm really in the mood
For a big corn dog or pupu platter
Two ding-dongs, have some tuna helper
I'll be racing back for more
But don't add any salsa cos I'll blow chunks on the floor
Ooh
Yahoo
Spike Lee, X II, The Merchandising.
Nordberg, look!
That's Frank at the Academy Awards.
- How'd he get tickets?
- Nordberg!
That's where Rocco is going to strike next.
He's planning to blow up the Academy Awards.
- We've got to go.
- We're not invited.
We're cops.
It's for you.
Nordberg, Police Squad.
Hello?
Hello?
Henderson, see about this phone.
I think it's broke.
RADIO:
And now, today's lucky lotto numbers.
Get your tickets ready, 12, 22, 18, and 9.
And for his tale of genetics gone haywire in a retirement community,
Steven Spielberg, Geriatric Park.
The winner is...
Raquel, just a second.
I just had a thought.
Christ!
This show is being seen all over the world.
If we could send good thoughts, transmit them through these cameras, to the leader of China.
Wing Wa Woo Tong, so that they might finally be nice.
Thank you.
And the winner is...
Raquel, so many go to bed hungry in this nation.
Yet, cat food's full of tuna.
I can't help thinking each time I go to the zoo and see those porpoises crammed into tiny tanks, what a waste that is.
Butcher half of them now.
Hundreds of pounds of dolphin meat that could be fed to cats, freeing up that tuna for our nation's hungry.
- And the winner is...
- So many are cold, shivering in the night.
I say take those cats and skin them.
Use their fur to keep hundreds warm.
Jesus, Phil!
And the winner is...
Give me that!
Ohh!
- Not one move.
- That barrel's cold.
It's room temperature.
It's okay.
It's not the bomb.
Jane?
Jane?
- Silver hair.
- About 6'2".
Looked like Phil Donahue.
- That's the guy!
- Get him!
PA:
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome internationally renowned singing star, Pia Zadora.
You're walkin' along the street
Or you're at a party...
There he is!
Stop him.
Excuse me.
Isn't that snot on your shoe?
MAN:
I'll stay here.
You check the wings.
...that this could be the start of somethin' big...
Oh, no!
Not him again?
Please, God.
Who knows what's written in that magic book?
But when a lover you discover
At the gate, my friend
Invite him in without a second look
You're watchin' the sun come up
Or counting' your...
Grab him!
I'm Ed Hocken.
This is Officer Nordberg.
- We're here to prevent a disaster.
- You're too late.
You're watchin' the sun...
Frank!
Or counting' your money
Or else in a dim cafe
You're ordering' wine
Then suddenly there he is
You want to be where he is...
Come on, Nordberg.
We've got to get Frank.
...the start of somethin'
This could be the heart of somethin'
This could be the start of somethin'
Big
Ohh!
Jane!
I knew I'd bump into you.
I want answers, cherry cakes.
- I love you.
- Wrong answer.
I dropped out of the sap of the month club.
Listen, you've got one last chance.
And I don't mean a major league baseball Steve Howe last chance.
- Where is Jane?
- I don't know.
- Where's the bomb?
- In the Best Picture envelope.
Mr Drebin, I want to go straight.
I'm tired of the lies.
Kiss me.
Please kiss me.
I've never kissed lips so innocent, so pure.
He looked like Phil Donahue, white hair...
- That's the guy!
- I'll get him.
PA:
Ladies and gentlemen, to present the Best Picture award, two most distinguished actors,
Olympia Dukakis and James Earl Jones.
Lord, what's that?
Looks like Phil Donahue throwing up in a tuba.
I don't think we should have Phil Donahue back next year.
Thank you.
Good evening.
It's a privilege for us to present the final award...
We've been worried about you.
Where's Rocco?
Where's Tanya?
- Sit down.
Take it easy.
- Thank God you're all right.
Indecent Instincts and Sawdust And Mildew.
Every one of these movies was a box office hit, except for one.
- What's that?
- The Best Picture award.
My money's on Sawdust And Mildew.
Olympia, would you do the honours?
Oh, my God!
That's the one!
The award for this year's Best Picture goes to...
Wait!
Oh!
Sorry about this.
Loved you in Coneheads.
You, too.
Let me open this.
It's the bomb!
Freeze and nobody gets hurt!
Well, from now on.
Back in your seats, you little weasels!
This programme's been interrupted.
Don't panic.
Stay with it.
Camera 2, move in on the old lady.
Better move back.
- Don't move!
- MA:
Now, pay attention!
I don't want to kill nobody unless I have to.
Drop your guns and kick them over here.
That bomb belongs to me.
Hand it over, Drebin.
You want to kill him, Ma?
Blink and I start shooting.
FRANK:
Give me that gun!
- Oh, my God!
- I'm not falling for that, sister.
I'm not well!
Get this stupid thing off me!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Ohh!
- Ma!
- She's a goner, Rocco.
Dead.
Then that's it.
I'm coming with you, Ma!
Pull out the bomb or I'll shoot the dame.
All right.
I'll do what you say.
- Frank!
- Don't harm her.
You pull out the bomb and you'll kill me anyway.
- Yeah.
No dice!
- Then I'll plug her.
- Shoot her, I'll empty the envelope.
- Frank, think about it.
It's all right.
You'll be dead.
Then you'll kill everyone here.
Yeah.
I'll shoot if you don't do as I say.
Jane?
I'd be safe, so would everyone else.
- But you'd be dead.
- This is complicated, Rocco.
Logically, you're psychotic, so you have the envelope, I'll have the gun.
- Frank!
- I know what I'm doing.
All right!
Here's your Best Picture!
In front of the world, this place is going up.
Well, if I'm going out, I'm going out happy.
Wait.
Before we're all blown up, can I get my underwear out of my crack?
- I got to go comfortable.
- Okay, but that's it.
- Give it up, Rocco.
You're history.
- Look, George Hamilton!
Come and get me, Drebin!
Throw me a gun!
Get rid of the bomb!
Hold on, sweetheart.
Frank, help!
- Frank.
- I know what I'm doing.
JANE:
I hate heights!
Ohh!
Oh, no!
Move it, sister!
Screw the commercials!
All right, copper, you killed my ma!
I'm taking the dame away from you.
You hear me, copper?
One push and Mrs Drebin is linoleum.
Get a camera up there.
This could be my best work.
Any last words before I throw you off?
- Yes.
Don't do it.
- Anything else?
Frank, I love you.
I want the world to know you're the perfect man.
Frank, I hope you can hear me.
They said I couldn't do drama.
I was wrong.
Taking you away from Police Squad was a mistake.
I know now that's why you couldn't perform decent sex.
I realise that now, and other things.
Everything's under control.
Nobody move!
Any vibration may set this thing off.
Frank, I've learned my lesson.
And though it may be too late for me,
I want all you ladies to remember something.
Don't ever take your men for granted, because good men don't just fall out of the sky.
Aah!
He's caught up in the cable!
Do something!
I'm coming, Ma!
Rocco?
Papshmir?
Jane...
- I never want us to be apart again.
- Oh, Frank!
You like me.
You really like me!
- Frank, slow down!
- Hurry up!
Relax.
There's time.
- You got the camcorder?
- Here.
Which room?
Delivery room.
This must be it.
Jane, I'm here.
Frank is here.
Push!
Here it comes now.
Breathe, honey.
Breathe, Jane.
One more push.
That's it.
Congratulations, Dad.
It's a boy!
Nordberg!
You come back here!
- Frank, it's a boy.
- I know!
You're walkin' along the street
Or you're at a party
Or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig
You're lookin' in someone's eyes
You suddenly realise
That this could be the start of somethin' big
There's no controlling' the unrolling' of your fate, my friend
Who knows what's written in that magic book?
But when a lover you discover
At the gate, my friend
Invite him in without a second look
You're watchin' the sun come up
Or counting' your money
Or else in a dim cafe
You're ordering' wine
Then suddenly, there he is
You want to be where he is
And this must be the start of somethin'
This could be the heart of somethin'
This could be the start of somethin' big
You're watchin' the sun come up
Or counting' your money
Or else in a dim cafe
You're ordering' wine
Then suddenly there he is
You want to be where he is
And this could be the start of somethin'
This could be the heart of somethin'
This could be the start of somethin'
Big
Hey, look!
It's the President!
And the Pope!
Oh, my God!
Look!
It's disgruntled postal workers.
Wait a minute!
Give me my baby back!
- Are you all right?
- I'm soaking wet.
- I'll get the talcum powder.
- It's not that.
I had a nightmare.
Crime all around me, I couldn't stop it.
- Frank, it was just a dream.
- You're right.
All I need is a good night's rest.
Tomorrow everything will be fine.
How's my little boy?
Getting along OK, sweetie?
As well as a heterosexual can in prison.
I don't know if I can take it any longer.
- How's Tanya?
- Tanya's the same.
Milky, creamy skin, pouting red lips, firm buttocks, ample breasts, ears you'd love to stick your tongue into...
- I'll get guy cramps if you keep this up.
- Sorry.
There's somebody here to see you.
Pahpshmir!
- My people are very upset.
- Of course, they're Arab terrorists.
You're supposed to be the world's best terrorist bomber.
- Train stations, government buildings.
- The devastation in South Florida.
- That was Hurricane Andrew.
- That's what they told the public.
We wanted to embarrass the USA.
You've made the police look like heroes.
I told you.
A first-class job would cost five million.
If you want to step up the price,
I got a target that'll make City Hall look like chicken feed.
A big target.
Why should anything be different?
Because five million dollars buys me!
I'm breaking out of here.
If you fail this time, Mr Dillon, my people won't be so forgiving.
Fail?
Show me one man who can stop me.
Attention shoppers, be sure to check out our special on paper towels.
That's aisle seven.
Hey!
- Give it to me!
- My purse!
Somebody help me!
- Let go of the purse, lady!
- Help me!
For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow which nobody can deny.
Well, we shot a lot of people together.
It's been great.
Today I retire.
If I do any shooting now, it'll have to be in my own home.
Hopefully, it'll be an intruder and not an in-law like at my bachelor party.
Ed, I officially give you my gun and my badge.
And...
Jane and I would like to keep the handcuffs as a souvenir.
Cheer up, Ed.
This is not goodbye.
This is just "I won't ever see you again".
- Somebody help me!
- Out of my way!
- Lt. Drebin!
Frank!
Didn't you see that?
- What?
Oh...
Yes, kitty litter.
Two bags for a dollar.
Great!
Order.
The jury will disregard that last statement.
Continue, counsellor.
- The alimony had been set by the court.
- Yes, but...
You haven't paid alimony in two years, repeatedly defying a court order.
- Isn't that right, Mr Clayton?
- I'd lost her address.
She moved twice.
Don't lie to me.
You're under oath.
Do you know what the penalty for perjury is?
- I'll ask you that again.
- Objection!
Your Honour, I...
Ow, ow, gee.
- Counsel is leading the witness.
- Sustained!
Mommy said no pounding when she's in session.
Read the prosecution's last statement.
"Don't lie to me, Mr Clayton.
You're under oath." Good boy.
"Do you know what the penalty for perjury is?"
That's all I have, Your Honour.
You may continue, Ms Spencer-Drebin.
Prosecution rests.
Defence Attorney Ms Davies-Jacobs-Steiner-Lazlo.
No further questions.
Court will recess until after the morning feeding.
- We can win this.
I can feel it.
- Yes, of course.
- I married the wrong man.
- I never thought that was possible.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, nothing.
Louise, there's no such thing as the wrong man.
You just have to work at it.
Now, let's see.
Mr and Mrs Drebin, right?
Now, you two have been married for six months?
Yes.
We really appreciate you seeing us, Doctor.
Our last therapist recommended you.
Yes, I was sorry to hear about his suicide.
A couple need to get off on the right foot and not get caught up in blame.
- Now, which one of you is impotent?
- That would be him.
Yes, of course.
- Why don't you ask who's frigid?
- That would be him.
- How would you know?
- He resents that I'm a working woman.
He has no idea what a woman wants or needs.
- You're so insensitive.
- Is this that toilet seat thing?
I want to have a baby.
Every time we make love, you have a headache.
I'm not a piece of meat.
I'm trying!
I've got ointments, lotions, creams, books, things that vibrate...
- Frank!
- Maybe it's your fault.
Have you tried sexy lingerie?
Lacy underwear?
A black teddy?
- I've tried them all.
They don't work.
- Oh!
Why don't you want a child?
Didn't I try to adopt that 18-year old Korean girl?
Jane, Frank, here's what I suggest.
Make tonight a special night.
Dinner, wine, romantic music.
Put on the 24-hour Johnny Mathis station.
Just be Jane and Frank.
Lovers!
We haven't had a night like that in a long time.
- Not together.
- Frank!
Jane, having a baby is a big responsibility.
Like being in charge of sanitation at a Haitian jail.
I'm just frightened.
Let's make tonight something special.
Oh, honey, it's just that I love you so much.
My little lover sparrow.
My puppy wuppy wuvver.
My little love biscuit.
- My little snookie wookums.
- My little lady cheesy puffy.
Mr and Mrs Drebin, please, I'm a diabetic.
I think you ought to go now.
- "I never thought we'd end this way." - "How did you think we'd end?"
I don't know.
Some other way.
Oh, Jason, please...
Bobbi...
- "I've been hurt before." - "We have to fight this thing together."
Ed, Nordberg!
It's been a long time!
- Good to see you, buddy.
- You look terrific.
I'm taking a step class, and I got a thigh master for Christmas.
Where are my manners?
Come on in!
- How charming!
- Sit, sit.
Excuse the mess.
It's my ironing day.
I've just frosted some cupcakes.
- Would you care for one?
- Not now.
We're having trouble with a terrorist threat.
- Police Squad is certain that...
- I'd love a cupcake.
- That coffee smells great.
- I grind my own beans.
We're here because we need your help with something.
- They're great!
- I'd hoped you'd like them.
Made from scratch.
I'll just get off my feet.
We may have a lead on a suspect in the City Hall bombing attempt.
These were taken by a photographer.
- She was used as a diversion.
- We've had them enlarged.
- They look familiar.
- No, Frank, the pin.
She's a nurse.
Can I keep this one?
We traced her to the Karlson Clinic on Myrtlewood.
Her name is Tanya Peters.
- Do you know her?
- Don't you remember back in the 70s?
The big disco shoot out.
Hey, Ed.
What's happening, my man?
We missed you last night at the fondue party.
Couldn't make it.
I saw the Village People.
They're gas.
- Far out, I can dig it!
- What's this?
One dead disco dancer.
- Bummer!
What a mind bender.
- We think it was a love triangle.
This is the suspect's girlfriend, Tanya Peters.
- Cigarette?
- Yes, I know.
We'll need a statement from you down at the station.
- Nordberg!
- Coming, lieutenant!
I do remember!
You were one of the first test cases for minoxidol.
- What?
- I'm glad I could be of help.
If you don't mind, I've got a rump of lamb to roast.
- We need a favour.
- It's not that big a rump roast.
It's not that.
We need you to go undercover at the clinic.
I've quit police work.
You're whistling up the wrong neck of the woods.
I wouldn't ask, but we're in a bind.
- What about Hedges and O'Malley?
- They're in Hawaii... together.
I can't.
Jane and I have a special evening planned.
It'll only take a few hours.
Still time to make dinner.
I don't know.
I'll have to make pork chops.
Think of all the crime.
Nobody is safe.
You'd be protecting Jane.
You'd be protecting all the Janes of the world.
- You haven't shot anybody in 6 months.
- That's true.
Funny how you miss the little things.
Might be good to feel cold steel against my thigh again.
The thrill of a chase... to be a man!
After folding the laundry, I set out for the clinic.
Police operations require a foolproof disguise.
This operation was no different.
I had no idea if Tanya would recognise me, so I wore fake glasses.
I combed my hair differently, just in case.
I planned to get in and find out about Tanya's connection with the bombing, and get out as quickly as possible.
I figured faking an old football injury would do the trick.
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see a doctor.
Sign in here, please.
Do you have an appointment, Mr...?
Smith.
No, I don't.
- Then take a number.
- Six.
- What?
- Is six taken?
Does it have to be between one and ten?
- You'll be called.
- Thank you.
Mr Smith?
We've had a cancellation.
We can take you now.
Dr Kohlzak?
Good morning, Mr Smith.
Right this way.
I appreciate you seeing me.
I'm sure it won't take too long.
- When did you first notice the problem?
- In the back yard with my uncle.
- In the back yard?
With your uncle?
- Yes, when he visits we like to go out in the back yard and throw it around.
What did you and your uncle find out?
I can't keep up with him.
Mine hurt, especially on the long ones.
I can't seem to straighten it out.
It has no feeling.
It's kind of numb.
I may have yanked it too much, maybe.
- If you would...
- For what?
- A sperm count.
- In here?
It's not exactly the back yard, but it will do.
Well...
Follow me, and we'll do the necessary paperwork.
Sign these at the bottom, and leave them with the nurse.
- This way, please.
- What?
- Number 17.
- A problem?
- No.
- This is 17.
You're next.
- Have we met before?
- If you excuse me, I'm next.
Sir...
Mr Smith, how are we doing?
I've been busy, if that's what you mean.
Would you like a video tape to assist you?
Do you have "Dances With Wolves"?
"Rocketeer"? "Lady And The Tramp"?
An adult movie.
The tape was very entertaining.
Follow me.
Do you have "Spartacus"?
Maintenance, clean up Room 7.
Maintenance, clean up Room 7.
Stat.
- What are you doing?
- Freshening up.
You should always look your best, even by yourself.
Are you sure we've never met?
Oh, here's my cup.
Back to work.
Mr Smith, are you OK in there?
I could use a little help.
Dr Rosenblatt, foreplay in Room 7, please.
Honey, I've been waiting all day.
I'm wearing the nightgown you bought me for our honeymoon.
Tonight's gonna be special.
I'll make love to you for hours and hours.
Wouldn't Mr Happy like that?
- Hours?
- Like our first time together.
Why don't I get ready and soak in the tub for a couple of days?
Possibly a week.
So cute!
Let me go and get the oysters and clams.
Here.
I'll shave your back like last time.
Jane, I really don't think we should.
- Frank, what's this?
!
- I fell... on a rake.
You're lying.
Now I know why Ed's been calling.
- You've been back on the case.
- No, I swear.
It's another woman.
In your wildest dreams!
It's bad enough you won't have a baby.
I warned you against working again.
You white Anglo male!
Jane, it was nothing.
I was only doing Ed a small favour.
Some retirement!
I'm leaving.
I never thought you'd go back on your word.
- Aren't you being a little hasty?
- I don't think so.
That's the cab.
You can reach me at Louise's.
How could you?
We need some time apart to think about us.
I'm not going to think.
Why now?
I love you.
Look, I am what I am, and I do what I do.
Some make shoelaces, some make a living neutering animals.
- I am a cop.
- Pretty speech.
My mind is made up, I'm leaving!
All right, then take this with you.
I guess you know how my lips feel about things.
Goodbye, Frank.
Your listening to K.S.A.D. All depressing, all the time.
Here's a dedication to Frank from Jane calling from a taxi.
You not only shoot blanks, you leave the door open, letting the heat out.
Were you born in a barn?
He wouldn't do any more police work.
Once a cop, always a cop.
- He's married to his work, not me.
- You'll come second.
There's an article in Cosmo, "Why All Men Are Pigs".
Read it!
Frank's just another word for "loser".
I never want to see him again.
I want to get far away from here.
We'll go to my friend's cabin.
The fresh air will do you good.
Go easy!
That's your second bottle of Chanel.
This is the beginning of a new Jane Spencer-Drebin.
No more Miss Perky who devoted her life to one man.
I'm out for the new me.
Let's burn rubber!
- Have you forgotten anything?
- I hope not.
Calm down.
How many bodies did you find in your pool?
In this state killing a gang member is only an $18 fine.
- Frank!
Glad you could make it.
- Welcome, buddy.
- Nordberg, Ed.
- Did you find Tanya's address?
I wrote it down on a hanky, and I can't remember what I did with it.
- I'm getting rusty.
- That could happen to anybody.
I brought you some of "Frank's Never Fail Fudge".
- Go on about your business.
- Smells great.
- I'll stay out of your hair.
- It'll be just like...
Frank, let me get that.
We have a surprise for you.
In honour of your 30 years on the force.
Nordberg!
Oh, boy.
This is really great.
Thank you, guys.
It might cheer you up.
We heard about you and Jane.
Jane, Jane...
The name will always remind me of her.
I feel bad about this.
If there's anything you need...?
- Like Dr Kevorkian's home number.
- Nordberg, put it together!
- We're here for you.
- Thanks.
- Look who's here.
Nice to see you.
- Ted.
- I have data for you on the bomb.
- What did you find out?
- The explosive is a very fine powder.
- It tastes like...
That's fertilizer.
It's for another case.
This is what I'm talking about.
- We detected nitroglycerine.
- Can you tell us where it came from?
I'd be glad to.
Billions of years ago, the earth was a molten mass...
- I mean the powder.
- We have no clue.
Let me take that urine, Frank.
We found a list of the bomber's plans at the scene.
- We analysed the paper.
- And?
The paper is from Statesville Prison.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
The wood is from the rare Canary Island Pine.
It only grows in Oregon.
Contacting paper mills led us to a distribution centre in Tacoma.
There the trail ended.
- How did you trace it to Statesville?
- The letterhead.
We compared the handwriting of all bombers serving in Statesville and found a suspect, Rocco Dillon.
He's masterminding the bombings from the prison.
If so, there's only one way to find out where Rocco'll strike next.
- We'll have to send someone in prison.
- I'll do it.
I wouldn't feel right about that.
If Rocco finds out, you might end up dead.
"You might end up dead" is my middle name.
- What about Jane?
- I don't know hers.
I need the action.
I'm going inside the big house.
Frank, Ed, you might want to see this.
We're testing a prototype for a new anti-carjacking device.
You'll get to see how it works.
- Get out!
- No.
Don't make me use...
"The Denver Jockstrap".
After being retired for six months, I was back in action.
Faster than you say "Spread'em!", I was inside Statesville Prison.
I was surrounded by pimps, rapists and murderers.
It was like being in the stands of an LA Raiders' game.
It was going to take all my police experience just to stay alive in here.
After a long and generous cavity search, I reached my destination:
Maximum security, home of some of the country's most violent sociopaths.
And the worst of them all, Rocco Dillon.
All right, in here.
Ain't no prison yet could hold me.
Attica!
Attica!
Power to the brothers.
Kill whitey, kill whitey!
Knock it off!
You're chirping loud for a new canary.
Keep flashing your eyes, and I'll balance your jaw.
Hey!
You know who you're talking to?
The man is Rocco Dillon.
- Where's your prison number?
- It's unlisted.
Just call me Nick "The Slasher" Magirk.
Look, ham head.
I'm the muscle in this pen.
Stay out of my way.
Just watch your step, Magirk.
Take it from me, this place changes a man.
- Oh, yeah, in what way?
- I used to be white.
I was the drummer for the Osmonds.
Screw with me, he'll make you feel pain you've never felt before.
I know, I remember the Osmonds.
- Better hit the rack, Magirk.
- In a minute.
First I'll make a list of the people I'm gonna kill in the next few days.
Lights out!
Lock down in two minutes!
My dearest snookie wookums buns,
I miss you so much.
I haven't felt this bad since... the last time I was dumped.
I remember it well.
Her name was Gabriella.
We were supposed to marry, but on our wedding day, she never showed up.
I was heartbroken, destroyed.
I figured she'd fallen for another man.
Someone who could do to her what I never could.
I thought my life was over until that one glorious day.
That was the day you became my wife.
All our friends celebrated our love.
It seemed like only yesterday.
We were all so overjoyed.
We wished they all could come with us.
That was the happiest day of my life.
I'll never forget the plans we made.
Things were going to be perfect.
We were going to get that housekeeper you always wanted.
Hi, Mr and Mrs D.
I knew that eventually our dream would come true.
One day we'd have our own Frank Drebin Jr.
Shut up, Magirk.
I'm trying to sleep.
It's no use.
She'll never come back.
Bend over and pick it up for me would you, lover?
No problem.
Rocco could tell from my escapade in the shower that I was courageous.
Now, I had to get on the inside.
Like a blind man at an orgy, I would have to feel things out.
Tyrone, I've got the escape plans here.
Just you and me.
- Burnett wants in, too.
- He's a guard!
- I know, but he's unhappy here.
- All right, whatever.
Got it all worked out right here.
What's this?
Another letter from your mommy?
- That's private, screw.
- Let's have a look.
- Give him back his letter.
- Buzz off, butter cheeks.
What's so special about a little letter?
Wait a minute... an escape plan!
This is your ticket to another 20 years.
If the Warden gets one look...
You call this slop?
Real slop has got chunks of things in it.
This is more like gruel!
This Chateau LeBlanc '68 is supposed to be served slightly chilled.
This is room temperature.
- What do you think we are?
Animals?
- No!
What are we?
Homo sapiens?
You're right!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
We are men!
No, no.
Stop!
Right hand red, left hand blue.
Who's got a hand in my pocket?
Come on, son.
You can do it.
Eat some beans.
You saved my bacon.
I'd be in solitary if you hadn't done that.
You've been handling yourself really good.
- Really well.
- Whatever.
I've got something big coming up.
I could have use for you.
You've got a dental plan?
What's the caper?
We've got to bust out of this playpen.
Thanks to you, we have an escape plan.
- It's a good plan.
- I've had better.
Listen, I've got a foolproof plan.
They've got Tyrone.
Can't we all just get along?
Now that Tyrone was in solitary, it was just me and Rocco.
He had no choice but to trust me...
Shh!
Hold on!
Anyway, I convinced Rocco to dig a tunnel.
It was either that or the laundry truck.
The thought of lying nose down in underwear with skid marks didn't leave a good taste in my mouth.
Disposing of the dirt was a problem I solved early.
Outside of some major chaffing, we made good progress.
We kept digging, and dummies gave the impression we were in our cell.
Lights out, Magirk.
There was more dirt than I anticipated.
Disposing of it was tricky.
Safe!
Where are you going?
Are you thinking of Frank again?
- They are playing our song.
- I understand.
Take your time.
- Hello, there.
- Excuse me.
I'm hauling a load of rice cakes to Big D.
- Why don't you come?
- No.
- How about a kiss?
- No!
I know women mean "yes" when they say "no".
How about that kiss?
- Yes.
- What do you mean "no"?
Come on, baby, we're two of a kind.
- You killed him!
- It was an accident.
Call the police.
Come to your senses.
You killed a man.
You're a hero to all American women!
Call Frank.
He'll protect us.
He's a man.
He'll lock you away for life.
I wanna help you kill as many men as possible.
Do what you have to do.
I'm calling Frank.
Be home, Frank, please.
Answer the phone, snuggle pants.
Frank!
- "Hi, this is Frank." - "And Jane.
We're the Drebins."
We're not home right now.
Leave a message.
- "Which button do I press?" - "Not that one."
Tanya?
It was another woman.
Frank was telling the truth.
Honeymoon Bay Road, I bet they're there right now.
Oh, Frank!
Cell inspection!
There's been a rumour of a possible break-out.
If we suspect anyone of attempting to escape, they will be punished severely.
Once word of the escape was out, we had to move for the tunnel.
The last few feet had to be dug on the run.
We were sure that another 47 yards would take us beyond the prison walls.
May he rest in peace in the arms of our loving...
Jesus Christ!
Amen.
Rocco had arranged for a getaway car to meet us.
After adjusting our direction, we arrived at the rendezvous point a Los Angeles city high school.
Hey, that was close.
Hey, Rocco, who's the old hag?
- She take one in the face?
- She's my mother!
Mrs Dillon, your son is a ruthless, sadistic, cold-blooded animal.
- You must be very proud of him.
- I am.
Ma, I want you to meet a real square egg, Nick "The Slasher" Magirk.
There are fresh clothes in the back.
Rocco's mother was quiet.
I sensed she didn't like me coming along.
Like a midget at a urinal, I would have to stay on my toes.
Hey!
Stop!
Oh, Frank!
It wasn't my fault.
That cow shouldn't have been on the road.
Hurry up, you're letting the flies in!
- What do you think, kid?
- Sweet setup.
No phones.
Miles from the nearest town.
Playboy Channel.
Perfect.
Nice digs, but I'm here for the action.
Are we taking banks or armoured cars?
- You're getting too nosy, Magirk.
- Relax, Ma.
- She's been itching to try this gun.
- I know the feeling.
It was Tanya.
That bathing suit was never happier.
I had only a second to admire the view.
I had to watch out.
If she made me as a cop, I'd be tonight's meat loaf.
- Come here, sexy.
- You're all woman.
I can tell.
Hey, she's referring to me.
I was talking about your mother.
That's no way to be walking around.
Get clothes on.
And what are you doing in my bathing suit?
- Hey, who's the stud?
- Meet our newest gang member.
Slasher Magirk, meet Tanya Peters.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
I smelt cop the minute I saw him.
I get that all the time.
The underwear ads.
Are you saying you're not a cop?
Well, yeah.
- That's good enough for me.
- I'm fine.
I'm glad that's all cleared up.
Ma, why don't you two kiss and make up?
Well, all right.
That's more like it.
I had to get a message to the squad.
This was more than I could handle by myself.
No phone and miles from people, I was worse off than a gerbil in a bath house.
Who's there?
Slasher, have you seen my pigeon?
Pigeon?
What pigeon?
- What are you doing?
- I'm just contemplating my next move.
Your bishop is exposed.
It's these pants.
I usually wear a fuller cut.
You're all man.
I like that in my men.
You're coming on to me big time, purring like a kitten with a mouse.
- But we got a problem.
- You're Jewish?
No.
You're Rocco's girl.
In my book that chapter is called "Look, But Don't Touch".
I could have two lovers.
Kinky.
But I like my sex the way I play basketball, one on one and with as little dribbling as possible.
You're tense, Slasher.
I could relax more, if I knew what was on tomorrow.
Do you know anything about that?
All I know is that it's downtown and... big.
That's the way I like it.
What else?
Just this...
- What are you doing?
- Thank you for the advice.
- I'll try that recipe out, Ms Peters.
- How could you?
You shove your tongue as far down as you can.
Quiet.
You're not supposed to know me here.
That's a goodbye kiss, sister.
- What's this?
Who's the skirt?
- Just some dizzy dame.
Her car broke down.
I'll take her to the bus.
Look, she's married.
What if her husband comes here?
- He will.
He must be great.
- He breaks promises.
And you traipse all over to spite a wonderful guy.
- He left me.
- You left him.
- You should talk!
- Listen to you.
- Listen to you!
- Listen to you!
You two, knock it off!
You'd think you were married.
- What do you want to do with her?
- One thing is for sure there's no room for her here.
- I say we bump her off.
- Let's plug her.
- No.
I was on a job that went hooey.
I'd have given my eyeteeth for a hostage.
Women make the best ones.
They are smaller, easy to take along, eat less, smell nice.
Yeah, we got us an insurance policy.
Good thinking, kid.
Come on, let's get some shut-eye.
We got a big day ahead of us.
It's rigged.
Keep your eye on the tower.
- It's what's going to happen tonight.
- Aren't we awfully far away?
On the top of that tower is a device that's going to net us five million bucks.
A thing I've been working on.
We'll detonate it this evening at an event the whole world will be watching.
- Your crowning achievement.
- It's for both of us, Ma.
- All set?
- Set.
Very impressive.
Cool.
Cool.
America will be brought to its knees by this terrorist act.
It'll be more embarrassing to the US than Tonya Harding.
We're there.
Give my regards to Mrs Gaddafi.
And tell her thanks for the cookies.
It's another beautiful night in LA, and the stars are shining bright for the 66th annual Academy Awards.
Fans are clamouring to see their favourite celebrities.
Here are two, "Weird Al" Yankovic and Vanna White.
Slasher, put the dame in the trunk.
I'll meet you and Ma around the back in ten minutes.
Got the passes?
- We pull this up, it's 5 million big ones.
- Not bad, Ma.
- What's going to happen to me?
- I have an idea.
- Slasher, you know what to do.
- Right.
Check the spare tyre and all fluid levels.
No, keep an eye on the dame.
We hit trouble, she's a bullet shield.
Ladies and gentlemen, to present the Academy's Lifetime Achievement...
Ready, 3.
Roll tape.
Go to clip.
Aspirin, please.
Go to 3.
Ready, 4.
This year's Lifetime Achievement Award winner's credits include great films.
"Sandals and Loincloth", 1958.
"Sweaty Boatmen", 1959.
"The Leather Clad Centurion", 1960, and his first colour feature in 1966, "Big Shiny Spears".
There's the man from Bryce/Porterhouse.
He guards the envelopes until they're handed out.
He won't budge from there.
Distract him so I can plant the bomb in an envelope.
Accepting the award for Mr Bronkowitz is Margaret Red Feather.
That ought to do it.
You'll pay for this.
Rocco'll kill you whoever you are.
- Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Isn't that a little unusual?
- It happened to me.
Here's the plan.
- You'll never stop Rocco.
- Your chances are one in a million.
- Better than any state lottery.
I'm the good guy.
I can't let the bad guys win.
Our children can't be raised in fear.
If we can't stop them, they'll blow that place up.
It'll be a tragedy, unless it happens during a dance number.
Come on.
Does that radio work?
Call Police Squad.
Tell them Frank Drebin...
Forget it.
I wonder what the devil he wanted?
- Hold on.
- Sergeant Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
- Yeah, and I'm Robert De Niro.
- Mr De Niro, we've got to get inside.
You and 10,000 other people.
Move along.
Movie stars only.
Come on.
I've got a better idea.
And cue talent.
To present the award for Best Supporting Actress Mariel Hemingway and Elliot Gould.

Thank you, sheriff.
Still no word of Frank or Rocco's gang.
I'm worried.
He should've phoned in.
Let me check your tickets.
Lovely gown.
Is that Cool Whip?
All right, Tim and Erica Brown.
OK, enjoy the show.
Let's see.
Vanna White and "Weird Al" Yankovic.
OK!
Ready, 3... and 3.
And Florence Henderson, "Analysis of a Proposal"...
- Rocco could be anywhere.
- He's had time to plant the bomb.
- And the winner is...
- This is going to be dynamite.
- Jane.
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yes.
Florence Henderson'll win.
It's about time.
- No, the bomb is in an envelope.
- You're right!
And the winner is Mary Lou Retton for "Fatal Affair".
I'm sorry, we were rooting for Florence Henderson.
We've got to get to the envelopes.
- So many.
- They added 75 categories.
"Best Actor in a Columbus movie"?
Best Director is presented by star of stage and screen Raquel Welch and host of his own award-winning talk show Phil Donahue.
That might be the envelope for the bomb.
Keep looking here.
One more second, Mr Donahue.
Oh, my God!
Look at Donahue.
Stop the stairs, Joey.
Joey!
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to present the...
What the hell?
!
- Jesus!
- Go to commercial.
Easy now.
Talk to me.
What happened, Ma?
Slasher is Frank Drebin of Police Squad.
Lousy, two-bit copper!
I treated him like my brother... the one I didn't kill.
- He might find the bomb.
- Not if I find him first.
- "Back from commercial in 5 seconds."
- Hurry up with the mike.
Cue Donahue.
Read it.
Read the card, moron.
"Well, Raquel, this certainly is a special evening.
Phew!"
"I can barely catch my breath.
Turn it over to Raquel."
"Raquel:
I'm used to being out of breath, working out to my..."
What's he doing?
!
"Hold for laughter.
To Phil.
Gets me out of breath just watching you."
- "To Raquel.
Oh, Phil..."
- I'm supposed to read that.
"Let's get to the subject at hand.
Pick up the envelope..."
The nominees for best director are:
Sir Richard Attenborough for his musical based on the life of Mother Teresa, "Mother".
Food, I love food and I'm really in the mood for a big corn dog of pooh-pooh platter two ding-dongs, it doesn't matter and some tuna helper, I'll be racing back for more
But don't get any sausage 'cause I'll blow chunks on the floor
Spike Lee, "X II
- The Merchandising"
Nordberg, look.
That's Frank at the Academy Awards.
How did he get tickets?
That's where Rocco Dillon is going to strike next, the Academy Awards.
- We have to get there.
- We're not invited.
We're cops.
- It's for you.
- Nordberg, Police Squad.
Hello.
Hello.
Henderson, see about this phone.
I think it's broke.
And now, here are today's lucky lotto numbers.
Get your tickets ready because here they come: 12, 22, 18 and 9.
And for his tale of genetics gone haywire in a retirement community,
Steven Spielberg, "Geriatric Park".
And the winner is...
- Raquel, just a second.
- Now what?
- I just had a thought.
- Oh, Christ.
This show is being seen all over the world, I was thinking if we could all send good thoughts through these cameras to men like the leader of China, Wing Wa Woo Tong, so that they might finally be nice.
Thank you.
And the winner is...
Raquel, so many go to bed hungry in this nation, yet cat food is full of tuna.
Each time I go to the zoo and see those porpoises crammed into tiny tanks,
I think, "What a waste that is."
Butcher half of them now!
That's a lot of dolphin meat that can be fed to our cats, freeing up that tuna for our nation's hungry.
- And the winner is...
- So many are cold, shivering in the night.
So I say, "Take those cats, skin them."
- "Use their fur to keep hundreds warm."
- Jesus, Phil.
And the winner is...
- You!
- Give me that!
- Not one move.
- That barrel's cold.
It's OK.
It's not the bomb.
- Jane.
Jane!
- "Big trouble!"
Jane.
Silver hair.
Kind of looked like Phil Donahue.
That's the guy!
Please welcome internationally renowned actress and singing star
Pia Zadora.
- Excuse me, is that snot on your shoe?
- Snot?
Where?
Oh, no.
Not him again.
Please, God.
Get off the stage!
Ed Hocken and Nordberg from Police Squad.
- We're here to prevent a disaster.
- Too late for that.
It's Frank.
Come on, Nordberg.
We've got to get to Frank.
Jane!
Jane!
I knew I'd bump into you somewhere.
I want answers, cherry cakes.
- I love you.
- Wrong answer.
I quit the Sap-of-the-Month Club long ago.
Angel drawers, you've got one last chance.
Not one of those Major-League- Baseball-Steve-Howe last chances.
- Where is Jane?
- I swear I don't know.
- Where is the bomb?
- In the Best Picture envelope.
Oh, Mr Drebin, I want to go straight.
I'm tired of the lies.
Oh, kiss me.
Please, kiss me.
I've never kissed lips so innocent, so pure.
He looked like Phil Donahue.
White hair.
That's the guy.
To present the Best Picture Award are two very distinguished actors.
Olympia Dukakis and James Earl Jones.
- Oh, Lord.
What's that?
- Phil Donahue throwing up in a tuba.
Make a note about not having Phil Donahue back next year.
Thank you.
Good evening.
It's a privilege to present the final award of tonight's ceremony.
We've been worried about you.
Where's Rocco and Tanya?
- Sit down.
Take it easy.
- Thank God you're all right.
"Indecent Instincts" and "Sawdust and Mildew".
Oddly enough, all these movies are box office hits, except one.
- What's that?
- It's the Best Picture Award.
Olympia, would you do the honours?
Oh, my God.
That's the one!
The award for this year's best picture goes to...
- Wait!
- Oh, great.
Sorry.
Loved you in "Coneheads".
You, too.
Let me open this.
It's the bomb!
Freeze, and nobody gets hurt!
Well, from now on.
Take your seats, the party's over!
This programme's been stopped.
OK, don't panic.
Camera 2, move in on the old lady.
Better move back, 2.
- I said, "Nobody moves."
- Sit down and pay attention!
I don't want to kill anybody unless I have to.
Drop your guns and kick them over here.
I believe that bomb belongs to me.
Hand it over, Drebin.
You want to do the honours of killing him, Ma?
Blink, and I start shooting.
Give me that gun.
- Oh, my God!
- I'm not falling for that one, sister.
- Ma!
- She's a goner, Rocco.
Dead?
Then that's it.
I'm coming with you, Ma!
- Pull out the bomb, or I'll shoot her.
- All right, Rocco.
All right.
I'll do what you say.
Just don't harm her.
You pull out the bomb, you'll kill me and everyone else.
- No dice, Rocco.
- Then I'll plug her.
- If you do, I'll empty this envelope.
- Frank, think about it.
- It's all right, you'll be dead.
- You'll kill yourself and everyone here.
- Yeah.
- I'll shoot you if you don't do as I say.
- Jane?
- I'd be safe.
So would everyone else.
- But you'd be dead.
- This is getting a little complicated.
Let's be logical.
You're the psycho, you should have this and I the gun.
I know what I'm doing.
All right.
Here's your Best Picture, in front of a worldwide audience.
- This place is going up.
- If I'm going out, I'm going out happy.
Wait, Rocco, before we're all blown to bits.
Mind if I pull the underwear out of my crack?
A man's got to go comfortable.
All right, but that's it.
- Give it up, Rocco, you're history!
- Look, George Hamilton!
Come and get me.
Throw me a gun.
Get rid of the bomb.
Hold on.
Frank, help me!
- Frank!
- I know what I'm doing.
I hate heights.
Move it.
Screw the commercials!
All right, copper.
You killed my ma.
I'm taking the dame away from you.
You hear me, copper?
One push and Mrs Drebin is linoleum.
Get a camera up there.
This could be my best work!
- Any last words before I throw you off?
- Yes, don't do it.
- Anything else?
- Frank, I love you.
I want the world to know you're the perfect man.
- "Frank, I hope you can hear me."
- They told me I couldn't do drama.
I was wrong to take you away from Police Squad.
I know now that's why you couldn't perform sexually.
I realise that and a lot of other things now.
Everything's under control.
Nobody moves!
Any vibration might set this thing off.
Frank, I've learned my lesson.
Even though it may be too late for me, I want all ladies out there to remember:
Don't ever take your men for granted.
Good men don't just fall out of the sky.
He's caught up in the cable.
Frank, do something.
Hurry.
I'm coming, Ma!
- Rocco?
- Pahpshmir?
Jane, I never want us to be apart again.
Oh, Frank, you like me, you really like me.
- Frank, slow down.
- Hurry up, we're late!
- Relax.
Did you bring the camcorder?
- Right here.
- What room is she in?
- Delivery room.
This must be it.
Jane, I'm here.
Frank is here now.
- Push!
Bear down now.
- Breathe, honey.
One more push.
That's it.
Congratulations, Dad.
It's a boy.
Nordberg!
Come back here!
- Frank, it's a boy.
- I know!
Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy
We now return to the 1971 film Goodtime Slim, Uncle Doobie, and the Great Frisco FreakOut starring Troy McClure.
Slim, if we've got the bag with the stolen diamonds then what happened to the bag with our stash?
There's more than one way to get high, baby.
Please, Marge.
How often can I see a movie of this caliber on late night TV?
- Is there something wrong, Homie?
It's just that I've only seen this twice before and I've seen you every night for the last 11 ye...
What I meant to say is, we'll snuggle tomorrow, sweetie.
I promise.
Enchiladas.
Mom!
Dad!
Don't turn on the light!
There's a UFO outside my window.
Seriously.
Oh, Bart, it's just an old golf umbrella stuck in a tree.
Can I sleep in there with you guys tonight?
- No.
- Can I sit on the roof with a baseball bat in case a UFO comes?
Yes, that's fine.
Good, good.
I hope you kept the Homie fires burning.
- Homer!
Homer, wake up.
Wake up.
- What?
We need to talk about the marital difficulties we've been having lately.
Marge, there's just too much pressure.
What with my job, the kids, traffic snarls political strife at home and abroad.
But I promise you the second all those things go away, we'll have sex.
I simply can't wait that long.
Maybe we should get some help.
- How about a book?
- Okay.
A tasteful book.
Oh, all right.
Hey, Marge, this guy looks like Apu!
I don't want people to see us looking at these books.
What you looking at?
I'm just reading up on artillery.
Yes, and I'm pursuing my interest in...
This one's a good choice and it's not smutty.
It's a book on tape by Paul Harvey.
That Midwestern man on the radio who's like a pleasant version of Grampa.
Mr. And Mrs. Erotic American.
Mom, Dad, look!
This biography of Peter Uebberoth is only 99 cents.
- And I found the new Al Gore book.
- Sane Planning, Sensible Tomorrow.
I hope it's as exciting as his other book:
Rational Thinking, Reasonable Future.
I'm getting this book on UFOs.
Did you know they're real?
But there's a conspiracy to cover it up.
Oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy.
Mr. Vice President, someone finally bought a copy of your book.
Well, this calls for a celebration.
Celebrate good times Come on!
I will.
Hello, Americans.
Paul Harvey here.
Did you know every good American is at heart an erotic American?
It's true.
A famous couple...
I don 't need to tell you it was Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.
- Offered this advice:
"Double your pleasure with a bath together."
Homie, I can't quite fit.
The faucet's jammed into my back.
I'm stuck.
So am I.
- Kids?
- Kids?
- Kids?
- Kids?
A romantic vacation can provide titillation.
Sensual, sanitary seclusion awaits you at any of America 's fine AAA-approved motor lodges.
The Arabian Nights Room looks nice.
The Pharaoh's Chamber has a vibrating sarcophagus.
Sorry there, Fred and Ethel.
Should have made a reservation.
We only got one room left.
The toilet is overflowing in the Caveman Room.
Oh, here we are.
The Utility Room.
This isn't very erotic.
I think it's an actual utility room.
No, honey.
It's a romantic fantasy.
I imagine I'm the janitor, and you're the janitor's wife, who has to live with me in the utility room.
Don't mind me, folks.
Just need to get the old wet-dry vac.
By now, your new improved love life should have you flinging woo like nobody's business.
So to you, Mr. And Mrs. Erotic American, I bid good day.
Welcome home, son.
I broke two lamps and lost all your mail.
- What's wrong with your wife?
- You wouldn't understand.
- Flu?
- No.
- Protein deficiency?
- No.
Pneumonoultramicroscopic- silicovolcanoconiosis?
- No.
- Unsatisfying sex life?
N...
Yes!
But please, don't you say that word.
What?
Sex?
What's so unappealing about hearing your elderly father talk about sex?
I had sex.
You're home safe.
See you the next time we need your signature.
Oh, you never wanna spend any time with me.
But I can help you with your loving problem.
I got a home remedy that'll put the dowsers back in your trousers.
Legend has it my great grandpappy stumbled upon this recipe when he was trying to invent a cheap substitute for holy water.
Here you g...
Hey!
Here you go, you ingrate!
Think of me when you're having the best sex of your life.
Drink it!
Here's $50.
Go to the movies, then take a cab to your aunt's.
Stay there.
Call you later.
Now, now, now.
- Homie, what's...?
- Marge, I'll explain to you afterwards.
What do you think Mom and Dad are doing?
I don't know.
Here he is, Rex Harrison and Paul Anka rolled into one.
That tonic really works.
You and Grampa should bottle it and go into business together.
You want me to spend more time with Dad?
What about my New Year's resolution?
You can make a lot of money.
Yeah.
Where are my pants?
You threw them out the window.
You said you'd never need them again.
Oh, hurry, Neddie.
They're awful.
You just be ready with that garbage bag.
Oh, mama!
This is finally really happening.
After years of disappointment with get-rich-quick schemes I know I'm gonna get rich with this scheme.
And quick.
Sir?
Hello, sir.
Yes.
You look like a man who needs help satisfying his wife.
So...
I guess people have some sort of moral objection to our sex drug.
Let me sell it, you idiot.
Step right up and witness the magnificent medicinal miracle of Simpson Son's patented Revitalizing Tonic!
Put some ardor in your larder with our energizing, moisturizing tantalizing, romanticizing, surprising, "her-prising," revitalizing tonic!
I doubt very highly that one elixir can boast so many fantastic properties.
What say we amscray out of here and have a wild wingding at the cyclotron, doctor.
Anything you say, professor.
Tonight, we'll push the twin beds together.
And I found something for Milhouse down at the mall too.
A pup tent.
Oh, boy!
Now I can sleep out in the yard!
Yeah!
Every single night.
I've discovered that the rejuvenating effect is actually a mild form of poisoning.
No doubt a result of the unsanitary conditions in Grampa Simpson's bathtub.
Nonetheless...
What's going on?
Where are all the grownups?
Who cares?
With no adults around, I run this city.
Carry on.
Listen to this.
"Unexplainable behavior.
Individuals acting in a secretive fashion are often involved with UFOs or other paranormal phenomena e.g. Telephone explosions."
Jeez!
If it's in a book, it's gotta be true.
Scary, no?
And this guy is head of the Spaceology Department at the Correspondence College of Tampa.
Will you cook my dinner for me?
My parents aren't around and I'm not allowed to turn on the stove.
Hurry up.
We got a lot of tonic to sell and a lot of towns to visit.
Frigid Falls, Mount Seldom, Lake Flaccid.
Great.
I'm gonna be stuck in a car all weekend with that wheezy windbag.
And that's what's wrong with Bart's generation.
Now as for your generation...
And for the minimal outlay of one dollar you can take home a bottle of liquid Lothario distilled Don Juan, catalytically carbonated Casanova.
Lock old Rover in the shed, because man has a new best friend in Simpson Son's Revitalizing Tonic.
I'm not convinced.
I've had bad luck with aphrodisiacs.
All questions will be answered, all fears will be allayed with one incontrovertible demonstration.
May I have a volunteer from the audience?
Yes, you, sir.
You've never seen me before, is that correct?
That is correct.
Well, then how come his face is on the bottle?
You're the worst shill ever!
You're a disgrace to the medicine show business.
They didn't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway music.
Okay.
It's now painfully clear.
The adults are definitely paving the way for an invasion by the saucer people.
You fool.
Can't you see it's a massive government conspiracy?
Or have they gotten to you too?
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Why are you guys jumping to such ridiculous conclusions?
Haven't you ever heard of Ockham's razor?
The simplest explanation is probably the correct one.
- So, what's the simplest explanation?
- I don't know.
Maybe they're all reverse vampires and they have to get home before dark.
- Reverse vampires!
- Vampires!
The undead!
Hey, wait a minute.
That's Amos Pierson's moose farm.
Make a right here.
Why are we stopping at this dump?
That's the house you grew up in, son.
Let's go find that hot dog tree I planted.
Yeah, we lived here till the bank foreclosed in '63.
Farm went bust after the cows started giving sour milk.
Something must've spooked them good.
Stupid cows!
Oh, memories.
If this old place could talk, it'd say...
There she is.
The old Radiation King.
You'd park yourself right there and watch for hours on end.
If I may, Helen, I'd like to respond to that question with yet another flip remark.
Look at me, Mom.
I am President Kennedy.
Oh, Abe, maybe our Homer could grow up to be president someday.
You, president?
This is the greatest country in the world.
We've got a system set up to keep people like you from ever becoming president.
Quit your daydreaming, melonhead.
Quit your daydreaming, melonhead.
Dad, how come you never gave me any encouragement?
Maybe I could've been something more than I am.
Like a travel agent to a great scientist.
Or the inventor of a hilarious refrigerator alarm.
Who are you to complain?
You lock me up in a home and give me the same damn shower safety seat every Christmas.
Your whole life, you never said one nice thing to me.
That's because you're a screwup.
- You're the screwup!
- Why, you little...
All right.
All right, that's it.
We're going home.
I'm sick of you and your stupid tonic.
If I hadn't taken that stupid tonic 38 years ago you'd have never been born and I'd have been happy.
You were an accident!
Get out.
- I'm sorry I said that.
- Out.
I'm gonna get out of the car.
And I hope you'll find it in your heart not to drive awa...
Well, I'll be all right as long as I can remember my Army training.
Dang.
I'm sorry.
Hi?
Homie, are you really going to ignore Grampa for the rest of your life?
Of course not, Marge.
Just for the rest of his life.
He said I was an accident.
He didn't wanna have me.
You didn't wanna have Bart.
You're never supposed to tell the child.
You tell Bart all the time.
But when I do it, it's cute.
So finally, we're all in agreement about what's going on with the adults.
- Milhouse.
- Okay, here's what we've got.
The Rand Corporation in conjunction with the saucer people...
- Thank you.
...under the supervision of the reverse vampires are forcing our parents to go to bed early in a fiendish plot to eliminate the meal of dinner.
We're through the looking glass here, people.
Kids, your daddy and his daddy are involved in a very sticky nutty, chewy, chocolatey...
Put it away, boy!
...situation.
And your daddy has realized something very important.
A father should always make his kids feel wanted.
Starting now, I promise to spend more time with you and give you the attention you deserve.
I can't breathe.
And feast your ears on this tantalizing testimonial from my own flesh and blood.
The son who puts the fun in Simpson Son my son, Barney.
I used to be a fat, disgusting slob.
That medicine seems to be giving your son a lot of gas.
I assure you his belching is the result of an unrelated alcohol problem.
It just ain't the same without Homer.
He knew how to drive a car.
Son.
My dear son.
From now on, I'm going to be a good and attentive father.
And for starters, your old man is gonna teach you how to ride your very first bike.
Dad, number one:
I know how to ride a bike.
Number two:
I already own a bike.
And number three:
That is a girl's bike.
You're no girl, you're a boy.
A good boy.
You can be president.
- Scratch that.
You will be president!
- Dad!
I think Lisa needs another push on her new tire swing.
No, Dad.
I wanna get down.
This tire is filthy and the steel belts are poking me.
No!
No!
No offense, but your half-assed under-parenting was a lot more fun than your half-assed over-parenting.
But I'm using my whole ass.
Dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be scary.
Someday you'll thank me for all this scary love.
But now I've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking.
- I'm sure he meant to say "drinking."
- That's what I assumed.
Here's where it all started to go wrong.
How am I supposed to be a good dad when I never had one myself?
Oh, Dad wasn't even around on Christmas morning when I actually got to meet Santa Claus.
Some father.
Wait a minute...
Dad!
This photo is a blessing.
It eases my pain.
This tonic's caused me nothing but trouble.
You've done all the damage you're gonna do.
Oh, nuts!
- Dad!
- Son!
I'm a screwup.
I burned down our house.
No.
I'm a screwup.
I burned down our house.
- You know what?
- What?
- We're both screwups.
- It doesn't matter.
What matters is you were right when you told me I never said anything nice about you.
So are you gonna say something nice now?
I hadn't thought that far ahead.
Okay, here it goes.
I'm not sorry I had you, son.
And I was always proud that you weren't a short man.
Oh, Dad.
What do you say we roll on the grass, son?
I'm with you, Dad.
Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy
We now return to the 1971 film Goodtime Slim, Uncle Doobie, and the Great Frisco FreakOut starring Troy McClure.
Slim, if we've got the bag with the stolen diamonds then what happened to the bag with our stash?
There's more than one way to get high, baby.
Please, Marge.
How often can I see a movie of this caliber on late night TV?
- Is there something wrong, Homie?
It's just that I've only seen this twice before and I've seen you every night for the last 11 ye...
What I meant to say is, we'll snuggle tomorrow, sweetie.
I promise.
Enchiladas.
Mom!
Dad!
Don't turn on the light!
There's a UFO outside my window.
Seriously.
Oh, Bart, it's just an old golf umbrella stuck in a tree.
Can I sleep in there with you guys tonight?
- No.
- Can I sit on the roof with a baseball bat in case a UFO comes?
Yes, that's fine.
Good, good.
I hope you kept the Homie fires burning.
- Homer!
Homer, wake up.
Wake up.
- What?
We need to talk about the marital difficulties we've been having lately.
Marge, there's just too much pressure.
What with my job, the kids, traffic snarls political strife at home and abroad.
But I promise you the second all those things go away, we'll have sex.
I simply can't wait that long.
Maybe we should get some help.
- How about a book?
- Okay.
A tasteful book.
Oh, all right.
Hey, Marge, this guy looks like Apu!
I don't want people to see us looking at these books.
What you looking at?
I'm just reading up on artillery.
Yes, and I'm pursuing my interest in...
This one's a good choice and it's not smutty.
It's a book on tape by Paul Harvey.
That Midwestern man on the radio who's like a pleasant version of Grampa.
Mr. And Mrs. Erotic American.
Mom, Dad, look!
This biography of Peter Uebberoth is only 99 cents.
- And I found the new Al Gore book.
- Sane Planning, Sensible Tomorrow.
I hope it's as exciting as his other book:
Rational Thinking, Reasonable Future.
I'm getting this book on UFOs.
Did you know they're real?
But there's a conspiracy to cover it up.
Oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy.
Mr. Vice President, someone finally bought a copy of your book.
Well, this calls for a celebration.
Celebrate good times Come on!
I will.

So am I.

A romantic vacation can provide titillation.
Sensual, sanitary seclusion awaits you at any of America 's fine AAA-approved motor lodges.
The Arabian Nights Room looks nice.
The Pharaoh's Chamber has a vibrating sarcophagus.
Sorry there, Fred and Ethel.
Should have made a reservation.
We only got one room left.
The toilet is overflowing in the Caveman Room.
Oh, here we are.
The Utility Room.
This isn't very erotic.
I think it's an actual utility room.
No, honey.
It's a romantic fantasy.
I imagine I'm the janitor, and you're the janitor's wife, who has to live with me in the utility room.
Don't mind me, folks.
Just need to get the old wet-dry vac.
By now, your new improved love life should have you flinging woo like nobody's business.
So to you, Mr. And Mrs. Erotic American, I bid good day.
Welcome home, son.
I broke two lamps and lost all your mail.
- What's wrong with your wife?
- You wouldn't understand.
- Flu?
- No.
- Protein deficiency?
- No.
Pneumonoultramicroscopic- silicovolcanoconiosis?
- No.
- Unsatisfying sex life?
N...
Yes!
But please, don't you say that word.
What?
Sex?
What's so unappealing about hearing your elderly father talk about sex?
I had sex.
You're home safe.
See you the next time we need your signature.
Oh, you never wanna spend any time with me.
But I can help you with your loving problem.
I got a home remedy that'll put the dowsers back in your trousers.
Legend has it my great grandpappy stumbled upon this recipe when he was trying to invent a cheap substitute for holy water.
Here you g...
Hey!
Here you go, you ingrate!
Think of me when you're having the best sex of your life.
Drink it!
Here's $50.
Go to the movies, then take a cab to your aunt's.
Stay there.
Call you later.
Now, now, now.
- Homie, what's...?
- Marge, I'll explain to you afterwards.
What do you think Mom and Dad are doing?
I don't know.
Here he is, Rex Harrison and Paul Anka rolled into one.
That tonic really works.
You and Grampa should bottle it and go into business together.
You want me to spend more time with Dad?
What about my New Year's resolution?
You can make a lot of money.
Yeah.
Where are my pants?
You threw them out the window.
You said you'd never need them again.
Oh, hurry, Neddie.
They're awful.
You just be ready with that garbage bag.
Oh, mama!
This is finally really happening.
After years of disappointment with get-rich-quick schemes I know I'm gonna get rich with this scheme.
And quick.
Sir?
Hello, sir.
Yes.
You look like a man who needs help satisfying his wife.
So...
I guess people have some sort of moral objection to our sex drug.
Let me sell it, you idiot.
Step right up and witness the magnificent medicinal miracle of Simpson Son's patented Revitalizing Tonic!
Put some ardor in your larder with our energizing, moisturizing tantalizing, romanticizing, surprising, "her-prising," revitalizing tonic!
I doubt very highly that one elixir can boast so many fantastic properties.
What say we amscray out of here and have a wild wingding at the cyclotron, doctor.
Anything you say, professor.
Tonight, we'll push the twin beds together.
And I found something for Milhouse down at the mall too.
A pup tent.
Oh, boy!
Now I can sleep out in the yard!
Yeah!
Every single night.
I've discovered that the rejuvenating effect is actually a mild form of poisoning.
No doubt a result of the unsanitary conditions in Grampa Simpson's bathtub.
Nonetheless...
What's going on?
Where are all the grownups?
Who cares?
With no adults around, I run this city.
Carry on.
Listen to this.
"Unexplainable behavior.
Individuals acting in a secretive fashion are often involved with UFOs or other paranormal phenomena e.g. Telephone explosions."
Jeez!
If it's in a book, it's gotta be true.
Scary, no?
And this guy is head of the Spaceology Department at the Correspondence College of Tampa.
Will you cook my dinner for me?
My parents aren't around and I'm not allowed to turn on the stove.
Hurry up.
We got a lot of tonic to sell and a lot of towns to visit.
Frigid Falls, Mount Seldom, Lake Flaccid.
Great.
I'm gonna be stuck in a car all weekend with that wheezy windbag.
And that's what's wrong with Bart's generation.
Now as for your generation...
And for the minimal outlay of one dollar you can take home a bottle of liquid Lothario distilled Don Juan, catalytically carbonated Casanova.
Lock old Rover in the shed, because man has a new best friend in Simpson Son's Revitalizing Tonic.
I'm not convinced.
I've had bad luck with aphrodisiacs.
All questions will be answered, all fears will be allayed with one incontrovertible demonstration.
May I have a volunteer from the audience?
Yes, you, sir.
You've never seen me before, is that correct?
That is correct.
Well, then how come his face is on the bottle?
You're the worst shill ever!
You're a disgrace to the medicine show business.
They didn't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway music.
Okay.
It's now painfully clear.
The adults are definitely paving the way for an invasion by the saucer people.
You fool.
Can't you see it's a massive government conspiracy?
Or have they gotten to you too?
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Why are you guys jumping to such ridiculous conclusions?
Haven't you ever heard of Ockham's razor?
The simplest explanation is probably the correct one.
- So, what's the simplest explanation?
- I don't know.
Maybe they're all reverse vampires and they have to get home before dark.
- Reverse vampires!
- Vampires!
The undead!
Hey, wait a minute.
That's Amos Pierson's moose farm.
Make a right here.
Why are we stopping at this dump?
That's the house you grew up in, son.
Let's go find that hot dog tree I planted.
Yeah, we lived here till the bank foreclosed in '63.
Farm went bust after the cows started giving sour milk.
Something must've spooked them good.
Stupid cows!
Oh, memories.
If this old place could talk, it'd say...
There she is.
The old Radiation King.
You'd park yourself right there and watch for hours on end.
If I may, Helen, I'd like to respond to that question with yet another flip remark.
Look at me, Mom.
I am President Kennedy.
Oh, Abe, maybe our Homer could grow up to be president someday.
You, president?
This is the greatest country in the world.
We've got a system set up to keep people like you from ever becoming president.
Quit your daydreaming, melonhead.
Quit your daydreaming, melonhead.
Dad, how come you never gave me any encouragement?
Maybe I could've been something more than I am.
Like a travel agent to a great scientist.
Or the inventor of a hilarious refrigerator alarm.
Who are you to complain?
You lock me up in a home and give me the same damn shower safety seat every Christmas.
Your whole life, you never said one nice thing to me.
That's because you're a screwup.
- You're the screwup!
- Why, you little...
All right.
All right, that's it.
We're going home.
I'm sick of you and your stupid tonic.
If I hadn't taken that stupid tonic 38 years ago you'd have never been born and I'd have been happy.
You were an accident!
Get out.
- I'm sorry I said that.
- Out.
I'm gonna get out of the car.
And I hope you'll find it in your heart not to drive awa...
Well, I'll be all right as long as I can remember my Army training.
Dang.
I'm sorry.
Hi?
Homie, are you really going to ignore Grampa for the rest of your life?
Of course not, Marge.
Just for the rest of his life.
He said I was an accident.
He didn't wanna have me.
You didn't wanna have Bart.
You're never supposed to tell the child.
You tell Bart all the time.
But when I do it, it's cute.
So finally, we're all in agreement about what's going on with the adults.
- Milhouse.
- Okay, here's what we've got.
The Rand Corporation in conjunction with the saucer people...
- Thank you.
...under the supervision of the reverse vampires are forcing our parents to go to bed early in a fiendish plot to eliminate the meal of dinner.
We're through the looking glass here, people.
Kids, your daddy and his daddy are involved in a very sticky nutty, chewy, chocolatey...
Put it away, boy!
...situation.
And your daddy has realized something very important.
A father should always make his kids feel wanted.
Starting now, I promise to spend more time with you and give you the attention you deserve.
I can't breathe.
And feast your ears on this tantalizing testimonial from my own flesh and blood.
The son who puts the fun in Simpson Son my son, Barney.
I used to be a fat, disgusting slob.
That medicine seems to be giving your son a lot of gas.
I assure you his belching is the result of an unrelated alcohol problem.
It just ain't the same without Homer.
He knew how to drive a car.
Son.
My dear son.
From now on, I'm going to be a good and attentive father.
And for starters, your old man is gonna teach you how to ride your very first bike.
Dad, number one:
I know how to ride a bike.
Number two:
I already own a bike.
And number three:
That is a girl's bike.
You're no girl, you're a boy.
A good boy.
You can be president.
- Scratch that.
You will be president!
- Dad!
I think Lisa needs another push on her new tire swing.
No, Dad.
I wanna get down.
This tire is filthy and the steel belts are poking me.
No!
No!
No offense, but your half-assed under-parenting was a lot more fun than your half-assed over-parenting.
But I'm using my whole ass.
Dad, it's just that too much of your love can really be scary.
Someday you'll thank me for all this scary love.
But now I've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking.
- I'm sure he meant to say "drinking."
- That's what I assumed.
Here's where it all started to go wrong.
How am I supposed to be a good dad when I never had one myself?
Oh, Dad wasn't even around on Christmas morning when I actually got to meet Santa Claus.
Some father.
Wait a minute...
Dad!
This photo is a blessing.
It eases my pain.
This tonic's caused me nothing but trouble.
You've done all the damage you're gonna do.
Oh, nuts!
- Dad!
- Son!
I'm a screwup.
I burned down our house.
No.
I'm a screwup.
I burned down our house.
- You know what?
- What?
- We're both screwups.
- It doesn't matter.
What matters is you were right when you told me I never said anything nice about you.
So are you gonna say something nice now?
I hadn't thought that far ahead.
Okay, here it goes.
I'm not sorry I had you, son.
And I was always proud that you weren't a short man.
Oh, Dad.
What do you say we roll on the grass, son?
I'm with you, Dad.
Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy
We now return to the 1971 film Goodtime Slim, Uncle Doobie, and the Great Frisco FreakOut starring Troy McClure.
Slim, if we've got the bag with the stolen diamonds then what happened to the bag with our stash?
There's more than one way to get high, baby.
Please, Marge.
How often can I see a movie of this caliber on late night TV?
- Is there something wrong, Homie?
It's just that I've only seen this twice before and I've seen you every night for the last 11 ye...
What I meant to say is, we'll snuggle tomorrow, sweetie.
I promise.
Enchiladas.
Mom!
Dad!
Don't turn on the light!
There's a UFO outside my window.
Seriously.
Oh, Bart, it's just an old golf umbrella stuck in a tree.
Can I sleep in there with you guys tonight?
- No.
- Can I sit on the roof with a baseball bat in case a UFO comes?
Yes, that's fine.
Good, good.
I hope you kept the Homie fires burning.
- Homer!
Homer, wake up.
Wake up.
- What?
We need to talk about the marital difficulties we've been having lately.
Marge, there's just too much pressure.
What with my job, the kids, traffic snarls political strife at home and abroad.
But I promise you the second all those things go away, we'll have sex.
I simply can't wait that long.
Maybe we should get some help.
- How about a book?
- Okay.
A tasteful book.
Oh, all right.
Hey, Marge, this guy looks like Apu!
I don't want people to see us looking at these books.
What you looking at?
I'm just reading up on artillery.
Yes, and I'm pursuing my interest in...
This one's a good choice and it's not smutty.
It's a book on tape by Paul Harvey.
That Midwestern man on the radio who's like a pleasant version of Grampa.
Mr. And Mrs. Erotic American.
Mom, Dad, look!
This biography of Peter Uebberoth is only 99 cents.
- And I found the new Al Gore book.
- Sane Planning, Sensible Tomorrow.
I hope it's as exciting as his other book:
Rational Thinking, Reasonable Future.
I'm getting this book on UFOs.
Did you know they're real?
But there's a conspiracy to cover it up.
Oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy.
Mr. Vice President, someone finally bought a copy of your book.
Well, this calls for a celebration.
Celebrate good times Come on!
I will.
Hello, Americans.
Paul Harvey here.
Did you know every good American is at heart an erotic American?
It's true.
A famous couple...
I don 't need to tell you it was Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.
- Offered this advice:
"Double your pleasure with a bath together."
Homie, I can't quite fit.
The faucet's jammed into my back.
I'm stuck.
So am I.
- Kids?
- Kids?
- Kids?

Hey-hey nice-nice out-outfit.
Ahh.
Ha ha.
Here you are.
Ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha.
Give me a dollar.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
King Kong, come here.
Come on.
Ha ha ha ha.
I didn't see anything weird.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're too kind.
I need a word with you, pal.
Who is you?
I'm busy.
Too busy to make $50,000?
Show's over, folks!
Aww!
Aww!
Sit.
Over there.
Oh, hey, I want my gold watch.
Come on, pal, over here.
Which one?
Which one?
Drake, this ape's a genius.
It's a monkey, and I'm the genius, not him.
Is it true you do burglaries with that, uh...
Little ape?
True?
That's what we do best.
Is that how I'm gonna make 50 grand?
Ah, we'll talk about that later.
First, we need a little demonstration...
Free of charge.
Ahh.
¶ Out came the sun ¶
¶ and dried up all the rain ¶
¶ and the itsy-bitsy spider... ¶
Yay.
You don't talk much.
You don't talk at all.
But you're my bright boy.
Do you think he's going to say anything?
Say "dada."
Come on, dad.
He's break dancing.
Look at this.
Eva's home.
Come on, let's go see your sis.
Let's go see your sis.
Hi.
Peter, come on in.
Thank you.
Just for a sec.
She's getting a little picture she made for me.
Oh, sure, sure.
Hey, Peter.
How are you?
Beautiful.
So how are we?
Mom:
Oh, did you get my message...
Peter:
Yes.
Scram, Jack!
Dad!
I'm ready for you!
Jack:
Coming, sweetheart.
Oh, search and destroy, eh, Jacko?
That's me...
Uh-huh.
That's you.
Handsome as ever, yeah.
An excellent rendition here in the middle.
This is a rottweiler, dad.
They're the greatest dogs.
It says here.
Look.
He could be our dog.
I can see that you've researched it.
Look, eva, airline pilots don't have dogs.
We travel too much.
No problemo.
When you're flying, he could stay here with me.
Baby...
How many times do you have to hear it?
You can't keep a dog here 'cause of your stepdad.
It's not my fault if he's allergic to animal hair.
Ohh.
Come on, it's not his fault, either.
See?
I told youse.
I trained him to pick gold, jewelry, cash, silver.
So, what?
It's a monkey, not an appraiser.
So what do you say?
This is perfect for the mahler score.
Anything goes wrong, only the monkey's there to take the heat.
He's gonna love it.
The monkey...
He'll love it.
Who's he?
Let's give this guy a down payment.
I gotta hunch we're gonna do business with him.
Hey, let's do some business here.
Drake:
Don't fool around.
Give him the money.
I had it right here, Drake.
I had it here.
What do you mean you had it?
I had it right here.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Hey, you know what this is?
It's your down payment.
You earned it.
Ha ha ha ha.
My school nurse says people can get over their allergies.
Sometimes having a dog around makes their body get used to it.
Tom's allergy isn't the only reason.
Eva, you're not responsible enough to care for a dog.
You need a diaper.
Look, you never listen to a word I say.
Your room is a complete disaster area.
You never get anything done on time.
Here, would you throw this out for me?
No, stanks.
If you can't even deal with a dirty diaper, how are you going to clean up after a dog?
Because, mom, I'd be doing it for my own puppy.
Well, how about doing this for your own brother?
Do I have to?
I'm eating.
He can do it himself.
Well, a dog won't be able to feed himself.
You'll have to do it twice a day.
I know.
How about this?
You going to give up your favorite TV shows when the dog needs to go for a walk?
Eva, listen.
If you really think you can handle it, then convince us.
Start helping out more around here, pick up after yourself.
And then, if I do all that, will you let me...
Honey, tom, look.
He's doing itsy-bitsy spider.
Have...
A dog?
¶ The itsy-bitsy spider ¶
¶ climbed up the waterspout ¶
¶ down came the rain and washed the brother out ¶ eva...
Eva...
Your brother loves you so much.
That's fine.
I just don't want you to love him so much.
You think everything he does is so precious.
I hate him.
He's a nerd.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't I pack his bag right now,
I'll leave him on the street tonight, and we'll just hope somebody really nice finds him and takes care of him.
Come on, mom.
Just shoot him.
They tooked everything!
She took the TV!
She even took my fricking food!
Aaahh...
What do you want?
The little jerk's...
Gone!
She left and tooked him with her, because of you.
She hated you and your stinking mess!
And she hated me for keeping you around!
You don't believe me?
!
Read!
Now get over it!
We got work to do.
Amy, calm down.
Don't touch anything.
Ohh...
Uhh...
My grandmother's pin and the ring you gave me.
Ah-choo!
Ah-choo!
Uhh!
The cash in your purse, was it large bills or small?
Uh...
J-just singles.
Why?
This guy wasn't a pro.
Breaking in with us in the other room, he goes for your good jewelry, but also grabs worthless junk, grabs the singles in your purse, but misses the "c" note in my wallet?
And to rip off a police lieutenant?
Amy:
Eva?
Eva, you're late.
What... what are you doing?
Get dressed.
Mom, all this stuff looks disgusting on me.
Do we have to do this every single morning?
Hey, look at that!
Hey, guys.
Eva, that's enough.
I said no.
Hi, eva.
Hi.
You're not coming in today?
Later.
Well, this is my dog Toto and I named him after the dog... eva:
Do you feed him?
Do you walk him?
Do you clean up his poop?
Ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha.
No.
Actually, my mom does most of that stuff.
Then he's not really yours.
Wanna bet?
He is so mine!
Only until your parents decide he's a big pain and get rid of him.
They're not gonna get rid of him.
Eva, please.
Now, it's Jesse's time to talk.
Do you want us to pay attention tomorrow when it's your turn?
Tomorrow?
I can't do it tomorrow.
I'm not ready.
I forgot.
Now, that's what you've been saying all month, eva.
Remember, we agreed that you were going to be more organized, you were gonna follow a schedule.
Now, you can do this.
I have faith in you.
Try to prepare something for show and tell next month, ok?
Go on, Jesse.
I like to dress him up a lot, and he's got like little...
I have nothing to show.
I have nothing to tell.
What am I gonna do?
That's easy.
You can always bring your brother.
My brother?
Forget it.
Never.
Jesse:
This is about it.
Gypsy:
It's a machine.
You know what to do.
Drake:
Anybody home?
Anybody home?
Get up, you bum!
You struck gold.
Your monkey's got a job.
Now call me, all right?
I want you to call me right away.
The big boss wants to meet you.
Yes!
Ohh...
Ha.
Oh, Harold, look at that little monkey.
That's quite a pet you've got there, young lady.
Does it bite?
I hope not.
Well, where did you get it?
From some... in the Caribbean, some pirates.
There's still pirates in the Caribbean?
You know, retired ones.
They own a restaurant now.
Man:
What's its name?
It's name?
Uh...
Dodger, 'cause he likes the hat.
Oh, he's a dodger... he's a dodger fan.
Oh, it's so wonderful... ohh!
Man:
Is he always so friendly to strangers?
Sometimes, occasionally.
Now he's coming to see me.
Oh, look at him go.
Oh, look at that.
Ha ha ha.
Isn't he something?
Well, thank you, little girl.
That's very nice.
Oh, Harold...
Look at this!
You scared him.
Hey, little dude, are you all right?
Did you run away from the zoo or the circus or something?
My name's eva.
How did you come to me like that?
Ohh...
Ha ha.
Ok, you're mine now, all right?
Is that what you want?
Oh...
Excuse me.
Shh.
It's ok.
It's ok.
Shh.
I know.
The bulldog scared you, didn't he?
But now you have to be really good and don't move, ok?
Promise?
Ok.
You're so cute.
What would really help, lieutenant, just find some photos of the 2 jewelry items...
you know, family snapshots, anything...
I can blow them up.
Yeah.
We'll dig something up.
Eva, wait.
What are you doing?
It's just cates.
Hey, eva.
What's up?
Oh, not much.
Ok.
See you later.
Bye.
Call me when those lab reports come in.
Right.
Will do.
Thanks, guys.
All right.
See you.
You think we should tell her what happened?
I don't know.
I really don't want to scare her with the idea of a robber sneaking into the house.
This is my room.
Yeah.
You're my secret.
Amy:
Sweetheart?
Good.
You're cleaning.
Mm-hmm.
You want a snack or anything?
Mm-mmm.
Sure?
All right.
Keep it up.
That was close.
What's wrong?
You trying to tell me something?
You, uh...
Uh...
You...
You need to go pee?
Yuck.
Gross.
No pee-pee on the floor, dodger.
No.
Bad.
No good.
Yuck.
Eva?
Katie for you.
I'm in the bathroom!
Honey, I got the phone right here.
You want me to leave it, or you want to hold, or what?
I can't!
I'm on the toilet!
On the toilet!
Ah-choo!
Uhh!
She's in... she's in the toilet.
She'll have to call you back.
Ah-choo!
Ah-choo!
Yeah, right.
What do you want?
Don't you dare talk to me like that.
How'd you find us?
She knows you're here, she'll kill you!
I'm not after her.
Woman:
Who is it?
!
It's nobody!
So now I'm a nobody?
You were always a nobody.
Where's my monkey?
You don't know?
Who you talking to there?
I'm talking to myself!
Is the monkey here, or ain't he?
Of course not!
She'd never let me keep him around.
Phehh!
Why?
What happened?
You lost him?
I can't believe it.
You lost him.
I didn't lost him.
I just can't find him.
Tell that ungrateful...
Mother of yours that nobody...
Is becoming somebody.
Here.
Get yourself new sneakers.
Mmm...
There you go.
Hey, you look cute.
What, you don't like it?
Dinner's ready.
The sign says "keep out" on the door.
Can't you at least knock?
I'll be there in a sec.
You'll be there now.
Come on.
We assume the zoo would be the logical place to report a lost monkey, so I wanted yez... youse... uh, you to know where to reach me.
Yeah.
It's Dr. Benjamin Stevenson.
Eva, Mr. Daily said you wouldn't let his dog in the elevator today.
What's this about?
I couldn't, mom.
If that dog got hair all over me, just think how bad it would be for tom's allergy.
As it is, I've been sneezing all afternoon.
See?
Thanks.
Hello?
Yeah.
Just a minute.
Eva, it's for you.
It's Katie.
Amy:
Tell her just for a sec.
We're having dinner.
Katie:
Hey.
Hi.
Can you keep a secret?
No.
I mean really swear to keep it.
No, I don't have a crush on anybody, Katie.
This is serious!
Oh, my God.
I gotta go.
I'll call you tomorrow at school.
Go!
Go!
What are you doing?
I'm just, uh, you know, I'm voguing.
Yeah.
Ah-choo!
Jeez!
Sorry.
Your mother wants you back at the table.
Come on.
Ohhh!
Tom:
Amy, I'm dyin'.
I'm dyin'.
Amy:
Oh, honey...
Tom:
Got a tissue?
Amy:
Yeah.
Here you go.
Oh, sweetie.
You sure you don't want to try some of that herbal tea?
I'm telling you, it really works.
Well, uh, I'm gonna go eat in my room.
Please excuse me from the table.
Bye.
What's up with her?
I don't know, but I was surprised what she said earlier about your allergy?
I mean, she was really concerned.
Yeah.
Maybe she's finally accepting the fact she can't have a pet.
There we go.
Do you like chicken?
Shoot!
I forgot a knife.
You don't like chicken?
Oh!
You don't like forks!
Do you like that?
Is that good?
Sweetie, your show's on.
I can't!
I'm busy!
I'm doin' my homework!
Good morning, mom.
What are you staring at?
You cleaned your room!
And...
You're dressed.
Look at you.
I'm supposed to learn responsibility, remember?
Come on.
Let's get some breakfast.
I'm starved.
Honey.
Oh, honey.
It's so clean, eva.
Tom.
Mmm...
What time is it?
Something's up with eva.
She just left for school.
No, no.
You're not late.
You're not late.
She and Paul went a half an hour early.
Oh.
Now, last night, she gave up her favorite show so she could do her homework.
And when I went in to wake her this morning, she was washed, she was dressed, the bed was made, the room was perfect.
Not one thing out of place.
And then at breakfast, she asked me how Jack was doing on his toilet training.
She was really interested in how I was teaching him.
Then she made her own lunch...
With 2 bananas and an extra sandwich.
Sounds like she met a guy.
That would explain the 2 bananas and the extra sandwich.
Right.
And she's teaching this guy how to use the potty?
Whee!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Wow.
Woman:
So are you gonna go to the meeting tonight?
I'd like to, but I don't have a babysitter.
Oh, I have somebody.
Oh, well, Jack never gets home until 9:00.
Why don't you call me?
Katie.
Come on, let's go.
No.
Let's wait for eva.
She has something really important to tell me.
Ok.
You're my friend.
She can tell you, too.
Hi, Annie.
Hi, eva.
Want to see your puppy?
No.
What can I do for you?
I want...
A capuchin.
A cu...
What?
He's a capuchin, isn't he?
Eva, where did you get him?
Um, my father got him from the Caribbean from some pirate or something.
But...
Can I ask you a question?
The only thing is, will he grow up to be like a big gorilla or something?
Ha ha!
No.
I'd probably say he's fully grown now.
Yes!
Ha ha ha!
Ok, see, he's a surprise present for my mom.
But my dad wants me to train him first.
So could you keep him here, you know, while I'm at school and stuff?
There she is!
Let's go!
Eva!
Eva!
We've all been waiting to hear the news.
What happened?
News?
It's not news!
It's a secret!
All:
We won't tell anyone!
We promise!
Ok, eva.
Go inside, all of you.
Just go!
You can't listen to our secret.
Go.
Go!
Go!
There.
What is it?
Come on.
I won't tell, I swear.
Katie, I can't tell you.
If I tell you and you tell one other person, it could ruin everything.
Ruin what?
Maybe I can help you.
I am your best friend.
Help me?
I told you I have a secret, and you tell the whole class.
You're not my friend anymore.
Great best friend, Katie.
You said you saw a monkey?
Yes.
In this park?
Yes.
I knew he couldn't have gone too far.
Yes!
Do you speak English?
No.
Tessa, stop.
Wait here a minute, ok?
He was a big hit around here.
Ha ha ha!
The funniest thing is how he loves the cash register.
I couldn't keep him away from it.
He thinks it's the greatest toy in the world.
Come on, dodger, get in.
Hi.
My teacher sent me.
I need all the books you have on monkeys.
Uh-huh.
All monkeys or a specific species?
I think I need a...
Cappuccino.
Oh, sweetheart, I need one, too, but we don't have a cappuccino machine here.
Do children drink that stuff?
Whoa!
This specific species.
The name sounds like cappuccino?
Ok.
I'm sure we have something here for you.
"Black howler."
Uh, "debrazza."
"Capuchin." That sounds like cappuccino, no doubt about it, huh?
Ok.
Yes.
Ok.
Uh...
Uh...
Thank you.
Uh...
Oh!
I'm sorry.
We... we have, uh...
Where do I look?
No.
No.
I'm gonna get it for you, all right?
I'll even make copies, uh, uh, for both of you so you won't even have to come back.
Dodger, get in.
"Capuchins live in tropical forests.
"They eat fruit, dry seeds, eggs, insects, spiders..."
"Small animals, such as lizards... " yuck!
No way I'm letting you eat lizards.
From now on, you're on a low-yuck diet.
"The mother carries the infant
"until it can travel safely on its own.
The father may carry the young on its back."
Hmm.
We're not that different.
"The females in the social group may mate with different males.
Members may leave, and new members join in."
We're not different at all!
It's ok.
He can't rat on us.
He can't even talk.
Hey, Jack.
You want to meet somebody?
Wait here, ok?
Come on out, dodger.
Come on out.
Come on.
See?
Isn't he cute?
Look.
He's wearing a diaper, just like you.
See?
Don't worry, dodger.
This is my brother Jack.
Jack, dodger.
Dodger, Jack.
You stay here and play while I read the rest of this stuff, ok?
Be good, dodger.
Eva: "Capuchins are at home in areas rich with trees.
They spend most of their time up in the branches."
Oh!
Oh!
Get it off me!
Sorry!
He's mine.
Don't worry.
Come here.
Oh, just take him, honey.
I'm sorry.
Ohh...
Ohhh...
Sorry.
Ohh...
Sorry.
Ohhh...
"Some monkeys are afraid of water.
All monkeys are afraid of snakes."
Hmm.
Oh, don't be a sissy.
"The adult monkeys spend much time
"grooming one another's fur.
"They enjoy this physical contact, which is also described as social grooming."
Yeah!
Shh.
Tom.
Come here, sweetie.
Come see this.
Look.
What have we done, right?
Honey, this is major.
Yeah.
Oh, sweetheart.
Eh, uh...
It says "only Jack allowed."
I'm her mother.
Mom!
Honey.
Honey.
It's just me.
It's ok.
You're just having a bad dream, sweetheart.
Lay down.
There you go.
Go back to sleep.
Go back to sleep.
Good girl.
Good night, baby.
Dodger.
Are you ok?
Where are you?
Oh, ok.
Good night.
Bye, eva.
Bye.
Thank you.
Annie?
Yes?
I have to go to my dad's for the weekend, and... that's great.
So you won't have to worry about hiding dodger, right?
Uhhh...
Right.
Want to go to the park?
I can't.
I have to go home and think.
How can I leave him here?
What should I tell dad?
How can I make this better?
Hello.
Eva:
Me and dad one on one for 2 whole days.
It's going to be impossible.
Oh, dodger.
Eva, your dad's on the phone!
Eva, did you hear me?
Don't come in here.
I'm coming!
What am I going to do?
I'm ok.
Stay calm.
Hey, maybe I shouldn't be ok.
Sick!
Toxic!
104!
Hey, pal, stay here.
I'll be right back.
Hello, dad.
Peter:
Baby, what's wrong?
You sound awful.
Oh, I feel awful.
Oh.
Well, then maybe I don't have such bad news after all.
Bad news?
What bad news?
Well, I was calling to say I can't see you this weekend.
Yeah.
See, they switched my flight schedule all around just a few hours ago...
it was a last-minute thing... and I'm already at the airport, and I have to be in Vancouver till Monday.
Anyway, if you're so sick...
Oh, I'm feeling better.
Thanks.
Listen, sweetheart.
I'll make it up to you, ok?
I mean it.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
I love you.
I love you, too, baby.
Now hang up and let me leave a message for mom, ok?
I'm gonna call back.
Bye.
Amy, listen, it's Peter.
Um, I know this is last-minute, but they switched my flight schedule all around, as per usual, and I have to fly to Vancouver this weekend, so I really need you to cover for me with eva.
Um, I'll make it up to you.
I appreciate it.
Have a great weekend with eva.
Bye-bye.
Thanks.
Machine:
I will erase your message.
Hello?
Eva:
Katie, it's me.
I'm not speaking to you.
Who cares?
I want to talk to your mom.
Oh, so what's the scoop for the weekend?
Oh, I'm going to dad's.
Yeah, Tessa told me that he called, but I didn't get a message.
Oh, I took care of everything.
Yeah, he said he'll be waiting for me.
Oh, mom, Katie's going to the beach for the weekend, so she can drop me off if you want.
It's a good idea.
I'll call missy after dinner.
Hi!
So glad you're doing this.
No, that's ok.
I'll just take it in back.
All right.
Uh, excuse me.
Ok.
Bye.
That baby is getting so big.
I know.
Thanks again.
Say bye-bye.
Say bye-bye.
Hey, what's the matter with you guys?
You're so quiet.
Maybe we don't have anything to say to each other.

Have fun!
Dodger, you don't have to hide.
Come on, get out.
That's easy.
There we go.
Oh, no!
It's locked!
But he never locks it.
That's it.
We're locked out.
He's totally trying to get us in!
Dodger, let me in!
Let me in.
You're unreal!
Now it opens!
Come on, dodger.
Let's go get some food.
I'm starved.
He didn't shop because he wasn't going to be here.
And I didn't bring any money because I'm stupid.
Yummy.
Everybody on the boardwalk does it.
Dodger, let's go make money.
Boy, you're really excited.
I knew you'd love it here.
No, dodger!
No!
Come on.
You don't have to hide down here.
Hey, today, you're going to be the special attraction.
Come on.
Come on out.
Good boy.
Come on, good.
There you go.
Enjoy yourself.
Is this place too crowded for you?
Why are you so scared?
Bet you've never been to a beach before, huh?
There's nothing to be afraid of.
That's the echo man.
Let's go check him out.
Echo man:
Ask not what your country can do for you...
Ask what you can do for your country.
Boy, he's good, huh?
Let's go back on the path.
Man:
Hey!
Oh, jeez!
Where did you go?
!
Stop!
Move!
You all right?
Please get my skateboard.
Don't worry.
I'll go get it.
Thank you, jackass.
Stop!
That's my monkey!
Don't let him fall!
Give me those!
Give me those!
I hate your face!
Gimme those.
Aah!
Sit still.
Where the hell you been?
You're supposed to stay in touch, let us know how the training's going.
Does it got to be now?
Training's great.
I'm trying to get in shape myself.
Jogging, you see?
Come here.
I got the boss breathing down my neck about this monkey thing now.
I'm about to lose my job.
I gotta know.
Can I depend on you?
I'm sorry.
I didn't want you to worry.
The monkey gots a cold.
What do you mean a cold?
Nothing serious.
We was training at the vet's.
It's all under control.
Control?
What are you talking about?
Hey, whoa!
Come here.
How sick is he?
Dodger, I can't do this.
Eva:
Dodger!
Oh, eh...
Oh, no, thanks.
I don't take cameras.
Cash only.
Understand?
You take picture, please?
Oh, ok, sure.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Thank you.
A whole dollar?
!
Dodger!
A buck!
Whoo!
Yes!
Thanks.
Thank you.
From the pirates of the Caribbean...
Give a hand to dodger...
the best monkey in the world!
Pet him for a quarter.
Pictures for a buck.
Rub his head and get good luck.
Not my head, the monkey's.
My wallet's gone!
I had it right here.
I had it right here.
There was a pickpocket in the crowd.
I saw him.
He was right here!
Did you see him?
Yeah, there was a guy standing right here.
Let's go this way.
Dodger, it's ok.
We got enough.
You're brilliant, you know that?
Mr. Big wants to see a dry run before we get anywhere near the mahler estates.
See?
That's it there.
Right there.
The old broad kicked off and left behind a fortune in rare coins and jewels.
The estate sale's Thursday.
We'll let them get organized, lay out the goods, then the monkey will drop in and do some shopping Wednesday night.
I can handle Wednesday.
Stop it!
They know my daddy here.
Cash, check, or credit card?
Huh?
Just regular money.
19.85, please.
Boy:
Do you want a separate bag for these, ma'am?
Here's your change, ma'am.
Little girl, can I see what you got in your backpack?
No.
Why?
I know her dad.
He's got a charge account here.
I just want to see what you got inside.
It's personal.
Where's your dad?
He's at the store across the street.
What's going on?
I think this little girl has been shoplifting.
No, no!
You have it wrong!
I didn't steal anything.
Then why don't you want me to look into your backpack?
Huh?
Hmm?
Look, hon...
We all make mistakes.
All I want you to do is walk up an aisle, and if there's anything you forgot to pay for in your backpack, just leave it there.
If you do, I'll forget this entire thing.
He must have an animal detector or something.
Oh, dodger.
What have you done?
You made me a thief.
Get back to work.
Why did you have to do that?
Huh?
If they caught you, I'd have to get rid of you.
Don't kiss up to me now.
You have no idea what you did, do you?
Yeah, you should hide in there...
And think about what a bad little monkey you've been.
Oh, my God.
This is from those people at the beach.
Oh, my God!
This is horrible!
He's a break-in artist, too.
He knew exactly how to get in this house.
I bet you don't even know what stealing means.
The books never said anything about you being a thief.
You do it because it's how somebody taught you.
Whoever it was, I hate them.
I'm going to dis-teach you.
Starting tomorrow,
I will dis-teach you to unlearn everything those jerks taught you.
Ok, dodger.
I want you to take this bag here and fill it with toys.
Toys... happy things.
Ok?
This is not going to be easy.
I said the toys.
Come here.
This is no!
No good, dodger!
No!
This is good.
Yes!
My monkey, yeah, on the little girl's bike.
Did you see where they went?
Yeah, they, uh...
They were going towards Ralph's.
That's no!
No!
That's bad!
No!
She put the monkey in her backpack.
In front of the market.
Which market?
That one.
There.
This is good.
Yes.
Good.
Good.
This?
Yucky.
No good.
This is good.
Yeah.
Yes.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Don't...
Move.
Uh!
Don't think about it, Buster.
Hey!
Put it back!
I said no!
Can you imagine?
She stole from me, totally ripped me off.
I caught her in here yesterday trying to shoplift.
My boss let her go.
Didn't even tell her dad.
Gee, if I knew where she lived...
I'd go talk to her old man.
Right now.
Well, I know him.
He's single.
I mean, he's divorced.
He has a charge account here.
I can get you the address.
227 hillcrest.
Hold on.
Dad, you still in the shower?
He can't pick up right now.
But he said just...
Bring the cab.
Ok.
Bye.
Thanks.
Huh?
It can't be the cab guy already.
I just called them.
Maybe if we just ignore them, they'll go away.
Hello?
Are you there?
Anybody home?
Hey.
What...
What's wrong?
Why are you so scared?
You're shaking all over.
Shh!
Shh!
It's ok.
Ok.
Shh!
Come on.
We'll go downstairs, take a peek.
Aah!
It's the pirate!
Open up!
I need to talk to you!
Dad, come down here!
Someone's trying to get in!
Get your father, girl!
He's busy!
Or maybe he ain't there at all!
Come on, dodger.
Come with me.
Little girl...
Don't be afraid.
I only want to talk with you.
Where are you, darlin'?
I'm running out of patience here!
What are you doing?
He's here!
Dodger, get in!
Driver!
Wait!
Bye, dad!
See you in a couple of weeks!
Yikes!
Go!
We don't take minors.
Company rules.
I'm not a minor!
I'm in a major hurry!
Please...
Go!
You got money?
Right here.
See?
Ok.
Go!
Bye, dad!
Please don't find me!
Please don't find me!
No, no, no, no, no!
Go faster!
Go!
How much faster?
This much!
Ohh!
Ah-aah!
Ah...
Aah!
Awesome!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
It worked!
They're beeping me.
Must be my lawyer.
I'll be right back.
Woman:
Hello?
Who's this?
I beg your pardon?
Did you beep me?
Oh, is this Dr. Stevenson?
We've paged you in reference to your missing monkey.
Oh, yes.
Dr. Stevenson... speaking.
Hi, sweetheart.
Where's Peter?
He was, uh, late for a game or something.
Where's mom?
She's with Jack over at nanny's party.
Wait.
You dropped something.
What is this?
I don't know.
How am I supposed to know?
It's not mine.
Ok.
I'm just tired.
I'm watching the ball game.
You want to watch with me?
It's the... your Dodgers are playing the pirates.
What?
What's wrong?
Uh, the first time was right here in the park, with the little girl...
And the same day, mother lost her earrings.
Sounds like it could be my monkey.
Do you know where the girl lives?
I'm afraid we don't.
You said you saw the monkey the first time.
When was the second time?
Uh, th-that was at the pet store, uh, right down the street there.
He doesn't look like a doctor.
Amy...
Something's up with eva.
I did something I thought was ok, but only it turned out not to be ok.
And now it's out of control, and I want to undo it, but I don't know how.
No matter what you've done, you have to tell your parents.
Go to your mom and you talk to her.
Don't be afraid.
I've been lying too much.
Well, then, telling the truth is the only way to make it better.
Ok?
No, no, no.
Store closed.
You can't come in.
I'm just going to get my monkey.
Who are you?
I am from the laundromat next door.
Where's Annie?
She's not here.
She had to go to the police station in a hurry.
What happened?
Some guy came in here and stole from her.
Where's my monkey?
!
I don't know anything about any monkey!
Dodger!
Dodger!
Annie was keeping my monkey for me!
All I know is some horrible man came in, stole some things, got her terribly upset, and she had to run off and report it all to the police.
He found us.
He came and took my poor little dodger.
Dodger.
If you help me, I'll give you more money.
Yeah, right.
Cross my heart.
Right now, he's mad at me.
He's all worked up.
I need you to calm him down.
Mom?
Mom.
Eva.
I need to talk to you.
I'm in such big trouble.
Yeah, I'd say you were in trouble, eva.
Amy:
We found it in your room.
I never saw this stuff before, mom.
I didn't steal anything.
It's my monkey.
My monkey did it.
Eva, what are you talking about?
We haven't seen any monkey.
That's because I've been hiding him.
And then I found out that he steals like a maniac.
And today I went to go pick him up at the pet shop, but the trainer...
He took him back.
My poor dodger.
I tried to stop him from stealing, but he wouldn't and then...
Tom, could you please help me?
Please, I really need your help.
Eva, sweetheart, start from the beginning, and it's best to tell us the truth, ok?
It is the truth!
No!
Ok.
I'll call the pet shop.
Yeah, sure.
No, no, no, no, no!
Wait...
The man who is there now doesn't know anything about my monkey, 'cause Ann had to leave after the pirate... eva, that's enough.
Just stop it!
Ho ho ho ho!
There he is!
On time!
Ha ha ha ha!
This is it, my friend.
One step away.
Charlie, give him the jewels so he can practice.
All the boss wants to do is see the monkey in action.
Loot for the demo.
Get over here.
Why did he do that?
Why did you did that?
What's wrong with you?
This ain't time for joking around.
Ha ha ha ha!
You guys got a wallet?
Drake:
What's going on here, huh?
He's ready for you guys.
Ju-just a second.
Now, Drake.
Don't move.
Drake:
Relax.
Please let me show you.
He's right out here.
Hey, uh, boss...
Boss, we got a problem.
What did she do to him?
Years of training wrecked.
Wait till I get my hands on her.
Of course I haven't seen a monkey.
She hasn't seen him because I've been hiding him in my backpack.
Hey, Amy.
Peter.
What are you doing here?
Peter:
I was just in the neighborhood doing errands, and I thought since I'd missed eva on the weekend, what do you mean, missed her?
I'd pick her up...
Amy, I was flying all over Canada last weekend.
You didn't get my message?
What's wrong?
Peter:
Amy, what's going on?
Where have you been this weekend while your father was out of town?
!
At his house.
What?
I just wanted to spend some time alone with my monkey.
What monkey?
Sweetheart, where are...
Peter, she's been stealing all over town and blaming it on some imaginary, invisible monkey.
Eva:
Mom, I'm telling you, he is real!
Eva, go to your room, and I want you to stay there until you're ready to tell us the truth.
But, mom... just go!
Excuse me, sir.
Something just jumped out of the back of your truck.
My monkey?
!
Yeah, it was your monkey.
He ran into the park.
Hey, wait!
Wait!
I'm open!
Peter:
But eva has always been so honest.
That's the thing.
I don't think she's ever lied to us before, do you?
Amy:
It's not like her.
She's not a thief.
Amy:
I just can't believe that she would steal from me.
Peter:
I can't, either.
Well, I've got the evidence, but it doesn't add up for me, either.
Amy:
I just find this monkey really hard to believe.
Go that way.
Can I speak to her?
Please, Tessa?
Please?
Eva, Katie for you.
Ask her.
She knows.
She saw the monkey.
Ask her.
I already did.
She said she doesn't know anything about it.
Amy:
Well, we all agree that we need to hear her version one more time.
Yeah, but if she mentions the monkey again, let's not focus on it.
We've got to try to get to the root of the problem.
I see it happen all the time.
The kid starts lying, does something wrong, next thing you know, the parents are calling us to report a runaway.
Honey, I don't think it's that serious.
Jack, come on.
Eva doesn't want to play.
Eva, voice-over:
To mom, dad, and tom...
Katie just told me she saw my monkey in the park.
I have to go rescue him.
P.S. This is not a lie.
I swear I'll never lie again, and I'll never keep a secret from you guys again.
Love you...
Eva.
Jack, what?
What?
Honey, I know eva's not in here.
I have to go look for her.
Monkeys.
Honey, what did you say?
Tom, Peter, hurry!
Jack, did you say what I think you said?
What's the matter?
What's goin' on?
Amy:
Shh!
Shh!
He's saying his first word.
Tom:
Yeah?
What did he say?
What did he say, Amy?
Come on, honey.
Tell me what you said.
What was it?
Tell mommy.
Say it again.
Monkeys.
Don't you think he's trying to tell us something, that a monkey was here and that he saw it?
No.
I'll tell you what he's trying to tell us.
Here's your monkey.
Monkey.
Right, Jacko?
Yeah.
What?
We better go get eva.
What is it, honey?
I'm gonna go to the park, tom.
Ohh!
Amy:
Honey!
Oh, no way.
Oh, my God.
There's my honey.
Hey.
Monkey.
Yes.
There's a monkey right there.
You were right.
Dodger!
Dodger!
Aah!
What have you done to my monkey, sweetheart?
He's not your monkey anymore.
He ran because he hates you.
He came to me.
He came to you just 'cause he likes kids.
He belongs to my son mark, who's around here somewheres looking like crazy for his monkey.
You stealed it from him.
Now, you don't want to break this poor kid's heart, do you?
You're a liar!
What did you do to my monkey?
You brainwashed him!
He don't steal no more!
He doesn't?
Damn right.
Don't pretend you ain't did it!
Don't you lie to me, girl.
I've quit lying!
I'm glad he doesn't steal anymore.
Good goin', dodger.
My monkey's name is fingers, not dodger!
I hate the damn Dodgers!
And now you'll help me find him.
Never!
Amy:
Tom, you're not sneezing.
Yeah, well, he's lived with us so long,
I must have gotten used to him.
Call him.
No!
Tom, how could you let him get away?
I don't know.
I thought he went back to you.
Let's just go look for eva, and we'll look for the monkey on the way, ok?
Dodger?
Oh, dod... ooh!
Somebody, help!
Somebody!
Mmm!
What was that?
Tom?
He took my gun.
Monkey took my gun!
Careful, dodger.
Careful!
Eva:
No!
Don't!
Good.
Good.
Good.
Get away.
Come on.
Get away.
Get away.
Steady, fingers.
Come on!
Run!
He's gonna get you.
Run!
I love you.
Ah!
He's lying.
Come on.
Nice little girl.
Dork.
What a nice little girl.
She's my friend.
I love her so mu... eh...
Yehh!
Ooh!
Ooh.
Eva?
Mommy!
Eva, you all right?
Oh, sweetie, are you ok?
Get in the car.
Please.
Get in the car!
I'm a poor gypsy.
"Please"?
I'm gonna rip your eyes out of you. "Please."
Please don't hurt me.
Ok, pal!
You're under arrest.
Come over here.
Get out of here!
I've been trying to call you, officer.
These men are killers.
They're trying to hurt me.
Oh.
Ahh...
Mmm-wah!
I got him, cates.
Thank you, your highness...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Get up!
For saving my life!
Put your hands behind your back.
You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford an attorney...
Oh, ho ho!
Ho ho!
One will be appointed to you by the court.
Understand these rights as I've explained it... what are you laughing about?
I'm not laughing!
I'm crying!
Hey, lieutenant, check this out.
Isn't this your wife's pin?
Oh...
Oh!
Hoo hoo hoo ho!
Ah, ha ha ha...
Yes, it is.
Oh!
Oh!
Ha ha ha!
Mmm-wah!
Ah!
Thank you!
Book him.
Can I keep him?
Please?
!
Now that you know how responsible I can be.
I took care of him so good, you didn't even know I had him.
Peter:
You know, she's got a point.
Yeah, I do.
I really do.
Mark:
Fingers!
Get over here, fingers!
Tom:
Amy!
Ha ha!
Oh, have I got good news for you.
What?
Oh, just, uh, pick a hand.
Come on.
Ohh!
Whoa!
My ring!
Oh, my God!
Honey, you found my ring!
He's your real dad, isn't he?
That's why you liked my hat.
Honey...
I love him a lot, you know.
Who cares?
He belongs to me.
Let him choose.
Sweetheart, what happened?
Where's your monkey?
That's dodger's real dad.
We let him choose, and he decided to go live with him.
Aw, baby, I'm sorry.
Can we go home now?
Yeah.
Sweetie...
Sweetie, listen to me.
Come on, fingers.
Stop that!
It's ok.
It's ok.
You were so brave.
You did the right thing.
I'm really proud of you.
Dodger!
Eva:
Come on.
It's just my classroom.
What's the matter?
Come on.
Don't be afraid.
This is our big day.
Come on.
Monkeys.
Yeah!
All gone?
Oh...
That's right.
He was all gone.
But you found him, didn't you?
I love you, Jack.
Dodger, get down here.
Why don't you say hello to everyone first?
I'm ready for my show and tell.
Ok.
Ok, you guys ready?
I am PhooIan Devi, you sisterfuckers!
PhooIan!
PhooIan!
She is only 1 1 .
tell him to wait a while.
But I've paid for her.
With this bike and cow... there's no shortage of girls for me.
It's rusting.
Agree, or I'm leaving.
Starved my cow, too.
Wait for how long?
What if she gets tampered with?
Another six months, please.
A daughter is always a burden, and ours is no beauty.
I need a wife now.
My mother is old and cannot work.
- Dad wants you, PhooIan.
- I've brought two buckets of water.
still, he wants you.
Your bridegroom is here.
I'II deal with the bastard.
Not scared?
Of what?
AII men are motherfuckers.
Who says?
Women at the well and in the fields.
Know what it means?
No.
It must be something cute.
Get a move on.
Now, go quickly.
What's the hurry?
Touch your husband's feet.
Take his blessings.
What's this?
Show me.
Hiding these earrings?
I gave them to her.
Not part of the deal.
Now, just go.
This side is for high caste Thakurs.
Low castes use the other side.
old man's wife!
Sons of bitches!
Motherfuckers!
May you marry witches!
It broke.
Why don't you get a brass pot, Iike Thakur wives?
Who do you think you are?
These modern girls!
shall I call your husband?
PuttiIaI!
PuttiIaI!
Think you're a queen, do you?
Being insoIent to my mother.
I'II teach you to show respect.
Be quiet now.
Sweet child.
Come here.
still not ripe.
Let me feel you.
Grow up fast.
How does it feel?
Don't be scared.
It's all right.
Scared of your husband?
You have to do this after marriage.
You are pretty.
You're my wife.
You have to do this with me.
Come... come...
still sulking?
Who'II feed the goats?
Me?
It hurts here.
It'II hurt more if you don't go.
Our daughter's taken her life into her own hands.
Now she'II be blown about like a leaf.
She's a Iow caste bitch.
still, I'd have her.
She's run away from her husband.
She must be itching for a fuck.
hello, PhooIan!
She'II spread her legs easily.
I'm getting the itch, too.
She's haughty.
Don't you hear me calling you?
I'm here for you.
I'II take your bundle on my bike.
But you'II have to do me a favor, eh?
Me do a favor for such a big man, the headman's son?
You're not less than me.
No less than a Thakur?
That's a joke!
I Iike you, anyway.
- Let me help.
- No, I can manage.
I'm going to the fair tomorrow.
Want anything?
No.
What's this?
Stop!
Grab the bitch!
Trying to trap me, the Iow caste bitch!
Teach her a lesson.
She's like a bitch in heat.
Break her bones!
Devideen, the village elders will question your daughter.
You agree?
- Yes, sir.
- Go!
Why were you alone in the field?
I always go alone.
Your daughter seems to have no respect for Thakurs.
Why did you call Ashok?
He came on his own.
On his own, did he?
Ashok, my son, I suppose you offered to carry her bundle?
- Yes, and he said he'd take me to--
- I know.
But what did you offer him in return?
Nothing.
- Suresh?
- Yes, uncle.
You tell us.
Don't be shy.
well, she said... that she's itching for it.
Don't laugh.
This girl's bad for our boys.
She'II have to leave the village.
- You can't even ride a bike now.
- My brakes don't work.
You're a fat slob.
Wait for me.
I don't wait for anyone.
These days, you move like a goat.
I said, "These days, there are lots of goats here."
What a view.
totally wonderful.
- Are you saying things about me?
- Yes.
You can say things about me.
Such as?
KaiIash, how handsome you are, just like a movie star!
You're a baldy.
Don't laugh.
Sit on my rod.
My wife's not here.
So?
I'm your cousin.
I wish you weren't.
I'II pedal, you sit on the rod.
I can do it, you'II see.
I can't sit there.
I'II sit behind.
AII right, fat slob.
Be careful.
Mastana, he's here.
Don't!
Stop teasing me!
- What's this?
- hello, Brother Madho.
What took you so long?
Who is she?
Her?
She's my driver.
Does she give a good ride?
Who's she?
Nobody.
Won't say a word.
She's dumb.
If you're talking about me, talk to me.
So she's dumb?
Who is she?
Speak to me, I said.
- Does she know who we are?
- Bandits, what else?
I'm not stupid.
I was born in this land, too.
Why isn't she with her husband?
I Ieft him.
- Where's her father?
- I Ieft him, too.
- KaiIash, I'm speaking to you.
- I'm telling you.
She's our caste.
A Thakur tried to force himself on her.
Beat her and her father.
They threw her out of the village.
She's living in my house.
girl!
The sisterfucker must have been desperate to want you!
I didn't give you permission to go.
Now, go.
- So you've seen Vikram again?
- Mind your own business.
You look like a bridegroom.
hello, Sister-In-Law.
tell her now.
What we decided.
I've changed my mind.
I'II tell her myself, then.
Be quiet.
You've been here long enough.
Aren't you planning to leave?
PhooIan!
Where are you going?
Mind your own business!
Go and live under your wife's thumb!
slave!
The Thakurs won't allow you back.
- Don't be stubborn.
- I'II see.
The train's coming!
You were expelled from the village.
Why did you return?
Because I had nowhere else to go.
How many men have you had?
Why have you arrested me?
The headman's house was burgled last night.
I wasn't even here.
Do you think we're fools?
We know you met the bandits with your fat cousin.
He sold you to them, didn't he?
Did they fuck you well?
Why did you leave your husband?
CouIdn't he satisfy you?
You can't keep me here.
will you take us both?
One in the front and one in the back?
She won't say.
She'II just do it.
Don't worry, we smell better than your bandits.
What are you doing standing there like a statue?
Do something!
What about the briefcase?
Briefcase?
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Let's go.
Put your thumbprint here.
Here's your girl, Devideen, hale and hearty.
Thank you, sir.
Touch the Thakur's feet.
They paid your ball of 25,000 rupees.
Look, what they've done to me.
Sergeant, what's this?
Thakur, sahib, she swears like a filthy animal.
Are your other girls like this one?
What happens to me?
These Thakurs paid your ball.
Show your gratitude.
She can't go back to her village.
Strict orders from above.
Come with us.
A girl child is a curse.
She knew she was banned, yet she landed up here.
Where could I go?
To the Thakurs?
Don't you know what they wanted?
They paid your ball.
To bed me?
Are you my father or my pimp?
You are shameless.
Not as shameless as they are!
PhooIan!
Come out!
This is Babu Gujjar's gang.
We have come for PhooIan Devi.
Everybody else remain indoors.
Send your low caste daughter out.
What is it?
Who are you?
You come here.
Madho, get him.
Let him be.
You're PhooIan's brother?
- Where are you taking my son?
- Where have you hidden your girl?
She's at her aunt's.
She was at the well an hour ago.
Vikram, go and check.
- Why hit him?
- Because he's a Iow caste MaIIah, too.
The headman's son has paid me to do this job.
Get her.
Remember, she's my catch, you sisterfuckers, not yours.
It seems she's gone.
She can't be far.
PhooIan's brother?
PhooIan, I've got your brother.
I'II cut off... his ears and nose.
I'm Babu Gujjar.
I keep my word.
I am here.
Let my brother go.
Long live Thakur.
Move!
Move!
Tarika, come on.
Madho, get her.
- Where are you taking me?
- I'm not the leader.
will they kill me?
What's going on?
She can't walk.
Tarika, she can't walk.
Cut off her nose and ears and throw her into the river.
It's too much for her.
So she can't walk.
- We should respect women.
- Now you're a preacher?
She's my catch, you sisterfuckers, and I'II do as I Iike.
Is she your sister?
Come on, you whore!
Now, see what I do with his sister.
They're here.
I don't trust that man.
So who'II get the ammunition?
MaIIah dog, your father?
If it's safe, why send two MaIIahs?
Why not send Tarika?
Because Tarika could fuck your mother.
shall I send her?
It's the motherfucking police!
Run, Tarika!
So, did you tell Nathu's mother?
I didn't need to.
She knew he'd die.
Like my mother knows and your mother knows.
Like his fucking mother knows.
Take it easy.
Who asked the fuckers to become bandits?
- You're alive to speak, bastard.
- On my own fucking strength!
The bastard's at it again!
Gujjar!
Nobody move!
Low caste bastards!
I said nobody move!
Say, "Long live Vikram MaIIah!"
Long live Vikram MaIIah!
Long live Vikram MaIIah!
Victory to the Goddess!
She has taken Babu Gujjar.
Let's move.
This place is jinxed.
Madho, search the corpses, and give everything to the poor.
It's bad luck to spend such money.
No one touches this girl.
Give her Tarika's clothes.
villagers of Astha...
I am Vikram MaIIah Mastana.
Greetings!
We are not police nor Thakurs.
Don't be scared.
We are MaIIahs like you.
We have come to make an offering.
O Lord Shiva... and Goddess Bhavani... we swear to protect this village... as long as it protects us.
Bharat, make the offering for the prosperity of this village.
May the Goddess protect you.
For the village.
Come.
This man's a woman.
No, a man with long hair.
PhooIan Devi.
She's Goddess Durga, sent to protect your village.
hall, Goddess Durga!
Take this gift from the Goddess.
Women are forbidden in gangs, Vikram.
They bring bad luck.
Forgive me, Baba, but bandits make their own luck.
I Iearned this from you.
Her father owes 25,000 rupees to Thakur GuIab Singh for her ball.
Then I have to return it with interest.
Give him the cash.
The poor Thakur must be upset.
Such matters are not discussed before women.
You go to sleep.
Vikram, you are a MaIIah... but like my son.
Don't do this.
Remember, the real boss of the gang is Thakur sriram, though he's in prison.
I know, Thakur Ghanshyam.
I can see hatred for Thakurs in your eyes.
That is not good.
I will not be able to stand by you.
So you bought me for 25,000.
It's good to know your worth.
If you were paying, why kidnap me?
Babu Gujjar captured you, not me.
I don't buy people.
I win their respect.
Even women.
Now sleep.
Don't stare.
sleep.
Shoot me.
What if I'd killed you?
It takes a Iot to kill a man.
You're not up to it.
Come on!
I can't!
Fuck!
Run!
The police!
Run!
- Look under the seats.
- A radio, Vikram.
We're police.
Come out.
I said police, motherfucker.
What's this, then?
You had nothing, eh?
police dogs, don't blame this on some innocent man.
This raid is by the gang of Vikram MaIIah and PhooIan Devi.
Vikram MaIIah and...
Write:
Vikram MaIIah and the beautiful bandit.
Get out.
He's laughing.
Out with him!
LaIaRam, when will you be back?
I hope you've enjoyed your stay, sriram.
It's been like a home away from home.
You brothers are our guests.
Make one move, and we'II invite you back.
Sign here.
sriram.
Greetings, sir.
A good day for you.
Cup of tea?
With pleasure, sir.
I hear there's a woman in your gang now.
Fun, eh?
But they say that a Vikram MaIIah is now the leader.
So it's the rule of the lower castes now, is it?
The man hasn't been born who can take over my gang.
He's my puppet.
I taught him everything he knows.
I hear he's dangerous.
Rubbish.
He's a monkey.
He'II dance to my tune.
The Thakurs have come!
Greetings, Thakur sahib.
Here is your rifle.
So, MaIIah, you've made quite a name for yourself.
A big gang... new guns, a woman, too.
By your grace.
A woman by my grace?
Bharat, tea.
Looks like you only get sugarIess tea here.
If there's a woman, why a man to make tea?
You mean her?
Who else?
- She's just like us.
- Just like me?
Let's see her.
Come and sit here.
Don't be shy.
I used to dream of you in jail.
It's been a Iong time since I touched a woman.
I saw a crow on a dead cow.
It's bad luck.
Why didn't you slap sriram?
If any bastard touches you, take your gun and shoot him.
Even your boss?
So?
Scared of Thakurs?
I don't trust those sisterfucking Thakurs.
Where's your gun?
Don't trust anyone, PhooIan.
Where's your gun?
Stop them!
Stay where you are!
Who fired?
Don't worry, the doctor will fix him.
Keep away!
Stay where you are.
- PhooIan, I'm finished.
- Don't say it.
I'II kill you, sisterfucker!
Bharat, Madho, collect money, all of it.
He'II have to go to a city doctor.
The bullet has grazed the bone, but I couId fix it.
He knows who we are.
How did I fuck?
What did you do?
I did all the work.
- That's how men do it in the city.
- really?
It's silly.
Let's see you naked.
Just once.
You're filthy.
- In the city, they do it naked.
- I'II cry for help.
I'm PhooIan Devi!
Vikram wants to fuck me!
- Who is it?
- The bullet doctor sent me.
- What does he want?
- Cash.
- We paid.
- For the dressings.
Now he wants his fee.
His sister's getting married.
The bridegroom wants a scooter.
Six thousand.
- Tomorrow.
- Too late.
I'II have to fetch the cash.
I'II come with you.
I'II give the doctor his corn, not show him the field.
I'II be back in an hour.
She's caused enough trouble.
What's she back for?
She's our daughter.
Where else would she go?
To her husband.
That's where she belongs.
That's worse than jail.
Do you know what--
PhooIan, people recognize you here.
We'd better leave, or there'II be trouble.
No offense to you, Vikram, but a girl should live with her husband.
The same fucking shit!
See how she speaks to her father?
Vikram, have I said something wrong?
She should go to...
AII right, I'II go to my husband.
I'II do what you should have done long ago.
Let's go, Vikram.
- Come out, PuttiIaI, you bastard!
- Don't beat me, please.
What do you want?
I'm a poor man.
I have nothing.
- Forgive me.
- Forgive you?
Write this to the police.
What?
Any man that marries a little girl...
I'II kill him.
I've never seen that side of you.
Where did you get the strength?
I don't know.
I ache all over.
But I feel at peace, Iike after a pilgrimage.
That's good.
The gang will meet us here.
- I'II go on the mound.
- And me?
You rest.
You've avenged your honor.
Now you're a real bandit, Iike the rest of us.
But remember... if you kill, kill at Ieast 20.
- Why?
- kill one, and they'II hang you.
kill 20, and you're famous.
They'II beg you to surrender.
Even give you a pension.
Mastana.
Why did you become a bandit?
Not for the name.
I heard... you were married.
I heard you were, too.
Marriage is like how my parents are.
What was I born of?
An act of love or of violence?
Show yourselves, you motherfuckers!
- Don't hit me.
- What else are you fit for?
Vikram was a fool to pamper you.
Draw water from the well.
I'm thirsty.
Now, go like this.
Go, or I'II smash you.
Look, this is the queen of the ravines!
PhooIan Devi, they call her a goddess!
This thing called me a motherfucker!
This is what we do to low caste goddesses!
KaiIash.
PhooIan.
Vikram...
Shh.
Someone's coming.
You can have me, too.
Have you gone mad?
You are PhooIan, PhooIan Devi.
Look at me.
I'm just a fat slob.
Yet the village salutes me.
Why?
Because I'm your cousin.
will he help me?
Nab Singh was Vikram's comrade.
- I don't trust any man.
- You trusted Vikram.
Baba, I've brought this woman without your permission.
She wants a favor.
I know of her.
She calls herself Devi.
Greetings, Baba.
She was Vikram's woman.
I warned Vikram that sriram and LaIaRam were police informers, but he wouldn't believe me, so he's dead.
Not just those brothers.
I have sworn to fight the whole Thakur clan.
Watch your tongue.
You're a woman, and of a Iow caste.
silence.
Bandits know no caste.
Those two called themselves bandits, too.
They raped me... stripped me and...
I know.
I am sorry.
But now what?
Your men are mostly muslims.
They do not yet believe in caste.
But soon the caste thing will turn the whole bandit kingdom upside-down.
This woman is trouble, Baba.
What does she want?
She wants her own gang.
Let's see what support she has.
Who is with this woman?
I am.
And I.
I'm with Man Singh.
Man Singh, you've always wanted your own gang.
You now have a partner.
Go ahead.
What can a woman do?
And a share for my other gun?
An extra gun always gets an extra share.
police uniforms.
Twenty-five.
And 16 guns.
- How many don't work?
- Five.
Twenty-five men, sixteen guns, five duds... and you want to raid Jangamajpur.
There'II be at Ieast 50 policemen.
Even Mushtaquim wouldn't try this.
Vikram would.
people of Jangamajpur, listen carefully!
This is the Man Singh and PhooIan gang.
The poor have nothing to fear.
Anyone who tries to stop us or close their shops will be shot.
Women and children, go in, do not be scared.
Open up!
Out of here, motherfucker!
The police!
What?
Run, PhooIan!
The police are here!
You want me, bastards?
Here I am!
- What's your name?
- Damayanti.
- What does your father do?
- He drinks.
Want to come with me?
Keep this.
For your wedding.
Long live PhooIan Devi!
Love live Baba Mushtaquim!
Your name echoes throughout the land.
You are considered a terror.
With your blessings, Baba.
I have news.
- There's only one thing I want to hear.
- I know.
sriram and LaIaRam will be attending a wedding.
- Where?
- Behmai.
Listen.
Don't do anything rash.
people of Behmai!
We've come for sriram and LaIaRam.
We know they are here.
Surrender quietly.
Any resistance will be met with bullets.
Women and children need not fear.
We've come for sriram and LaIaRam.
Find them!
Smash the doors.
Bring every man out.
Don't touch women and children.
They watched the fun while I was raped.
Sisterfucking Thakurs!
You took my honor here.
Where is your leader?
I don't know.
Where's he hiding?
- Don't know.
- tell me!
I swear I don't know!
Where's your leader, sisterfucker?
What prospect is there of catching PhooIan Devi and her gang?
She's a woman, Iow caste.
We'II catch her sooner or later.
You journalists are giving her unnecessary publicity.
She didn't get sriram and LaIaRam.
She killed 24 innocent Thakurs.
I, too, have killed, but not for nothing.
The place is crawling with cops...
like lice in a beggar's blanket.
Soon they'II set the army on us.
Each of those dead Thakurs will have some fucking relative in the government.
She'II die a horrible death.
Worms will feed on her corpse.
bloody bitch goddess.
We've surrendered.
Don't shoot!
Where are the others?
police attack... at river...
all dead.
Speak clearly.
Run away.
Don't go near water.
Look at this.
You brought bullets?
He says it's all over.
So he turns coward at the first sign of danger.
- I've seen enough corpses.
- Look carefully.
Bharat and Madho.
Shot them from this close.
Munna ran.
Shot him in the legs.
Then a bayonet through his throat.
Girdhari had one bullet.
Shot himself.
The police went to Ateek and sultan's village.
They were stripped naked and killed in front of their families.
The police say they will kill us all... unless you surrender.
They've poisoned the water.
KaiIash, have you got guns?
I've got water.
KaiIash, you've come to help me, haven't you?
KaiIash, wait.
My gang will come.
will you bring them?
Hey, my baIdy!
No one will come.
They're all dead.
I'II form a new gang or join another gang.
They will kill you... and me, too.
Why, you, my old baldy?
I'm your cousin, that's why.
I am PhooIan Devi!
Queen of these ravines.
I will stay here.
The ravines will hide me in their womb.
They cannot hide you now.
Come on out.
It's time to be reborn again.
Time to face the real world.
- Dad wants you.
- I've brought two buckets of water.
Come out, you whore!
I can smell you, filthy bitch!
You stink even worse.
I'II give you more pleasure than Vikram could.
We know you are rotting, you have no bullets.
The press makes you out to be some kind of a goddess.
But you're good for only one thing now.
You know what, don't you?
Remember my rod?
You must be longing for it.
Lots of people want you naked here, even more than Behmai.
Motherfucker!
We killed Vikram.
Now Man Singh will die because of you.
Let's move on.
Get away!
Don't come near me!
Go and surrender!
I'II tell Vikram you're a coward!
He'II beat you!
The goddess is angry with me.
There were bullets for everyone.
For Bharat, for Madho.
There are no bullets for me.
I want my mother.
I want my father.
My terms of surrender:
Our families must be protected... and given land to live.
After release, we should be given gun licenses for our security.
AII our children... should be given free education.
The famous bandit PhooIan Devi.... and her gang will surrender... before the Chief Minister.
The bandit PhooIan Devi...
We should be kept in open jails and released after eight years.
Long live PhooIan Devi!
I am PhooIan Devi, you sisterfuckers!

I am PhooIan Devi, you sisterfuckers!
PhooIan!
PhooIan!
She is only 11.
tell him to wait a while.
But I've paid for her.
With this bike and cow... there's no shortage of girls for me.
It's rusting.
Agree, or I'm leaving.
Starved my cow, too.
Wait for how long?
What if she gets tampered with?
Another six months, please.
A daughter is always a burden, and ours is no beauty.
I need a wife now.
My mother is old and cannot work.
- Dad wants you, PhooIan.
- I've brought two buckets of water.
still, he wants you.
Your bridegroom is here.
I'II deal with the bastard.
Not scared?
Of what?
AII men are motherfuckers.
Who says?
Women at the well and in the fields.
Know what it means?
No.
It must be something cute.
Get a move on.
Now, go quickly.
What's the hurry?
Touch your husband's feet.
Take his blessings.
What's this?
Show me.
Hiding these earrings?
I gave them to her.
Not part of the deal.
Now, just go.
This side is for high caste Thakurs.
Low castes use the other side.
old man's wife!
Sons of bitches!
Motherfuckers!
May you marry witches!
It broke.
Why don't you get a brass pot, Iike Thakur wives?
Who do you think you are?
These modern girls!
shall I call your husband?
PuttiIaI!
PuttiIaI!
Think you're a queen, do you?
Being insoIent to my mother.
I'II teach you to show respect.
Be quiet now.
Sweet child.
Come here.
still not ripe.
Let me feel you.
Grow up fast.
How does it feel?
Don't be scared.
It's all right.
Scared of your husband?
You have to do this after marriage.
You are pretty.
You're my wife.
You have to do this with me.
Come... come...
still sulking?
Who'II feed the goats?
Me?
It hurts here.
It'II hurt more if you don't go.
Our daughter's taken her life into her own hands.
Now she'II be blown about like a leaf.
She's a Iow caste bitch.
still, I'd have her.
She's run away from her husband.
She must be itching for a fuck.
hello, PhooIan!
She'II spread her legs easily.
I'm getting the itch, too.
She's haughty.
Don't you hear me calling you?
I'm here for you.
I'II take your bundle on my bike.
But you'II have to do me a favor, eh?
Me do a favor for such a big man, the headman's son?
You're not less than me.
No less than a Thakur?
That's a joke!
I Iike you, anyway.
- Let me help.
- No, I can manage.
I'm going to the fair tomorrow.
Want anything?
No.
What's this?
Stop!
Grab the bitch!
Trying to trap me, the Iow caste bitch!
Teach her a lesson.
She's like a bitch in heat.
Break her bones!
Devideen, the village elders will question your daughter.
You agree?
- Yes, sir.
- Go!
Why were you alone in the field?
I always go alone.
Your daughter seems to have no respect for Thakurs.
Why did you call Ashok?
He came on his own.
On his own, did he?
Ashok, my son, I suppose you offered to carry her bundle?
- Yes, and he said he'd take me to--
- I know.
But what did you offer him in return?
Nothing.
- Suresh?
- Yes, uncle.
You tell us.
Don't be shy.
well, she said... that she's itching for it.
Don't laugh.
This girl's bad for our boys.
She'II have to leave the village.
- You can't even ride a bike now.
- My brakes don't work.
You're a fat slob.
Wait for me.
I don't wait for anyone.
These days, you move like a goat.
I said, "These days, there are lots of goats here."
What a view.
totally wonderful.
- Are you saying things about me?
- Yes.
You can say things about me.
Such as?
KaiIash, how handsome you are, just like a movie star!
You're a baldy.
Don't laugh.
Sit on my rod.
My wife's not here.
So?
I'm your cousin.
I wish you weren't.
I'II pedal, you sit on the rod.
I can do it, you'II see.
I can't sit there.
I'II sit behind.
AII right, fat slob.
Be careful.
Mastana, he's here.
Don't!
Stop teasing me!
- What's this?
- hello, Brother Madho.
What took you so long?
Who is she?
Her?
She's my driver.
Does she give a good ride?
Who's she?
Nobody.
Won't say a word.
She's dumb.
If you're talking about me, talk to me.
So she's dumb?
Who is she?
Speak to me, I said.
- Does she know who we are?
- Bandits, what else?
I'm not stupid.
I was born in this land, too.
Why isn't she with her husband?
I Ieft him.
- Where's her father?
- I Ieft him, too.
- KaiIash, I'm speaking to you.
- I'm telling you.
She's our caste.
A Thakur tried to force himself on her.
Beat her and her father.
They threw her out of the village.
She's living in my house.
girl!
The sisterfucker must have been desperate to want you!
I didn't give you permission to go.
Now, go.
- So you've seen Vikram again?
- Mind your own business.
You look like a bridegroom.
hello, Sister-In-Law.
tell her now.
What we decided.
I've changed my mind.
I'II tell her myself, then.
Be quiet.
You've been here long enough.
Aren't you planning to leave?
PhooIan!
Where are you going?
Mind your own business!
Go and live under your wife's thumb!
slave!
The Thakurs won't allow you back.
- Don't be stubborn.
- I'II see.
The train's coming!
You were expelled from the village.
Why did you return?
Because I had nowhere else to go.
How many men have you had?
Why have you arrested me?
The headman's house was burgled last night.
I wasn't even here.
Do you think we're fools?
We know you met the bandits with your fat cousin.
He sold you to them, didn't he?
Did they fuck you well?
Why did you leave your husband?
CouIdn't he satisfy you?
You can't keep me here.
will you take us both?
One in the front and one in the back?
She won't say.
She'II just do it.
Don't worry, we smell better than your bandits.
What are you doing standing there like a statue?
Do something!
What about the briefcase?
Briefcase?
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Let's go.
Put your thumbprint here.
Here's your girl, Devideen, hale and hearty.
Thank you, sir.
Touch the Thakur's feet.
They paid your ball of 25,000 rupees.
Look, what they've done to me.
Sergeant, what's this?
Thakur, sahib, she swears like a filthy animal.
Are your other girls like this one?
What happens to me?
These Thakurs paid your ball.
Show your gratitude.
She can't go back to her village.
Strict orders from above.
Come with us.
A girl child is a curse.
She knew she was banned, yet she landed up here.
Where could I go?
To the Thakurs?
Don't you know what they wanted?
They paid your ball.
To bed me?
Are you my father or my pimp?
You are shameless.
Not as shameless as they are!
PhooIan!
Come out!
This is Babu Gujjar's gang.
We have come for PhooIan Devi.
Everybody else remain indoors.
Send your low caste daughter out.
What is it?
Who are you?
You come here.
Madho, get him.
Let him be.
You're PhooIan's brother?
- Where are you taking my son?
- Where have you hidden your girl?
She's at her aunt's.
She was at the well an hour ago.
Vikram, go and check.
- Why hit him?
- Because he's a Iow caste MaIIah, too.
The headman's son has paid me to do this job.
Get her.
Remember, she's my catch, you sisterfuckers, not yours.
It seems she's gone.
She can't be far.
PhooIan's brother?
PhooIan, I've got your brother.
I'II cut off... his ears and nose.
I'm Babu Gujjar.
I keep my word.
I am here.
Let my brother go.
Long live Thakur.
Move!
Move!
Tarika, come on.
Madho, get her.
- Where are you taking me?
- I'm not the leader.
will they kill me?
What's going on?
She can't walk.
Tarika, she can't walk.
Cut off her nose and ears and throw her into the river.
It's too much for her.
So she can't walk.
- We should respect women.
- Now you're a preacher?
She's my catch, you sisterfuckers, and I'II do as I Iike.
Is she your sister?
Come on, you whore!
Now, see what I do with his sister.
They're here.
I don't trust that man.
So who'II get the ammunition?
MaIIah dog, your father?
If it's safe, why send two MaIIahs?
Why not send Tarika?
Because Tarika could fuck your mother.
shall I send her?
It's the motherfucking police!
Run, Tarika!
So, did you tell Nathu's mother?
I didn't need to.
She knew he'd die.
Like my mother knows and your mother knows.
Like his fucking mother knows.
Take it easy.
Who asked the fuckers to become bandits?
- You're alive to speak, bastard.
- On my own fucking strength!
The bastard's at it again!
Gujjar!
Nobody move!
Low caste bastards!
I said nobody move!
Say, "Long live Vikram MaIIah!"
Long live Vikram MaIIah!
Long live Vikram MaIIah!
Victory to the Goddess!
She has taken Babu Gujjar.
Let's move.
This place is jinxed.
Madho, search the corpses, and give everything to the poor.
It's bad luck to spend such money.
No one touches this girl.
Give her Tarika's clothes.
villagers of Astha...
I am Vikram MaIIah Mastana.
Greetings!
We are not police nor Thakurs.
Don't be scared.
We are MaIIahs like you.
We have come to make an offering.
O Lord Shiva... and Goddess Bhavani... we swear to protect this village... as long as it protects us.
Bharat, make the offering for the prosperity of this village.
May the Goddess protect you.
For the village.
Come.
This man's a woman.
No, a man with long hair.
PhooIan Devi.
She's Goddess Durga, sent to protect your village.
hall, Goddess Durga!
Take this gift from the Goddess.
Women are forbidden in gangs, Vikram.
They bring bad luck.
Forgive me, Baba, but bandits make their own luck.
I Iearned this from you.
Her father owes 25,000 rupees to Thakur GuIab Singh for her ball.
Then I have to return it with interest.
Give him the cash.
The poor Thakur must be upset.
Such matters are not discussed before women.
You go to sleep.
Vikram, you are a MaIIah... but like my son.
Don't do this.
Remember, the real boss of the gang is Thakur sriram, though he's in prison.
I know, Thakur Ghanshyam.
I can see hatred for Thakurs in your eyes.
That is not good.
I will not be able to stand by you.
So you bought me for 25,000.
It's good to know your worth.
If you were paying, why kidnap me?
Babu Gujjar captured you, not me.
I don't buy people.
I win their respect.
Even women.
Now sleep.
Don't stare.
sleep.
Shoot me.
What if I'd killed you?
It takes a Iot to kill a man.
You're not up to it.
Come on!
I can't!
Fuck!
Run!
The police!
Run!
- Look under the seats.
- A radio, Vikram.
We're police.
Come out.
I said police, motherfucker.
What's this, then?
You had nothing, eh?
police dogs, don't blame this on some innocent man.
This raid is by the gang of Vikram MaIIah and PhooIan Devi.
Vikram MaIIah and...
Write:
Vikram MaIIah and the beautiful bandit.
Get out.
He's laughing.
Out with him!
LaIaRam, when will you be back?
I hope you've enjoyed your stay, sriram.
It's been like a home away from home.
You brothers are our guests.
Make one move, and we'II invite you back.
Sign here.
sriram.
Greetings, sir.
A good day for you.
Cup of tea?
With pleasure, sir.
I hear there's a woman in your gang now.
Fun, eh?
But they say that a Vikram MaIIah is now the leader.
So it's the rule of the lower castes now, is it?
The man hasn't been born who can take over my gang.
He's my puppet.
I taught him everything he knows.
I hear he's dangerous.
Rubbish.
He's a monkey.
He'II dance to my tune.
The Thakurs have come!
Greetings, Thakur sahib.
Here is your rifle.
So, MaIIah, you've made quite a name for yourself.
A big gang... new guns, a woman, too.
By your grace.
A woman by my grace?
Bharat, tea.
Looks like you only get sugarIess tea here.
If there's a woman, why a man to make tea?
You mean her?
Who else?
- She's just like us.
- Just like me?
Let's see her.
Come and sit here.
Don't be shy.
I used to dream of you in jail.
It's been a Iong time since I touched a woman.
I saw a crow on a dead cow.
It's bad luck.
Why didn't you slap sriram?
If any bastard touches you, take your gun and shoot him.
Even your boss?
So?
Scared of Thakurs?
I don't trust those sisterfucking Thakurs.
Where's your gun?
Don't trust anyone, PhooIan.
Where's your gun?
Stop them!
Stay where you are!
Who fired?
Don't worry, the doctor will fix him.
Keep away!
Stay where you are.
- PhooIan, I'm finished.
- Don't say it.
I'II kill you, sisterfucker!
Bharat, Madho, collect money, all of it.
He'II have to go to a city doctor.
The bullet has grazed the bone, but I couId fix it.
He knows who we are.
How did I fuck?
What did you do?
I did all the work.
- That's how men do it in the city.
- really?
It's silly.
Let's see you naked.
Just once.
You're filthy.
- In the city, they do it naked.
- I'II cry for help.
I'm PhooIan Devi!
Vikram wants to fuck me!
- Who is it?
- The bullet doctor sent me.
- What does he want?
- Cash.
- We paid.
- For the dressings.
Now he wants his fee.
His sister's getting married.
The bridegroom wants a scooter.
Six thousand.
- Tomorrow.
- Too late.
I'II have to fetch the cash.
I'II come with you.
I'II give the doctor his corn, not show him the field.
I'II be back in an hour.
She's caused enough trouble.
What's she back for?
She's our daughter.
Where else would she go?
To her husband.
That's where she belongs.
That's worse than jail.
Do you know what--
PhooIan, people recognize you here.
We'd better leave, or there'II be trouble.
No offense to you, Vikram, but a girl should live with her husband.
The same fucking shit!
See how she speaks to her father?
Vikram, have I said something wrong?
She should go to...
AII right, I'II go to my husband.
I'II do what you should have done long ago.
Let's go, Vikram.
- Come out, PuttiIaI, you bastard!
- Don't beat me, please.
What do you want?
I'm a poor man.
I have nothing.
- Forgive me.
- Forgive you?
Write this to the police.
What?
Any man that marries a little girl...
I'II kill him.
I've never seen that side of you.
Where did you get the strength?
I don't know.
I ache all over.
But I feel at peace, Iike after a pilgrimage.
That's good.
The gang will meet us here.
- I'II go on the mound.
- And me?
You rest.
You've avenged your honor.
Now you're a real bandit, Iike the rest of us.
But remember... if you kill, kill at Ieast 20.
- Why?
- kill one, and they'II hang you.
kill 20, and you're famous.
They'II beg you to surrender.
Even give you a pension.
Mastana.
Why did you become a bandit?
Not for the name.
I heard... you were married.
I heard you were, too.
Marriage is like how my parents are.
What was I born of?
An act of love or of violence?
Show yourselves, you motherfuckers!
- Don't hit me.
- What else are you fit for?
Vikram was a fool to pamper you.
Draw water from the well.
I'm thirsty.
Now, go like this.
Go, or I'II smash you.
Look, this is the queen of the ravines!
PhooIan Devi, they call her a goddess!
This thing called me a motherfucker!
This is what we do to low caste goddesses!
KaiIash.
PhooIan.
Vikram...
Shh.
Someone's coming.
You can have me, too.
Have you gone mad?
You are PhooIan, PhooIan Devi.
Look at me.
I'm just a fat slob.
Yet the village salutes me.
Why?
Because I'm your cousin.
will he help me?
Nab Singh was Vikram's comrade.
- I don't trust any man.
- You trusted Vikram.
Baba, I've brought this woman without your permission.
She wants a favor.
I know of her.
She calls herself Devi.
Greetings, Baba.
She was Vikram's woman.
I warned Vikram that sriram and LaIaRam were police informers, but he wouldn't believe me, so he's dead.
Not just those brothers.
I have sworn to fight the whole Thakur clan.
Watch your tongue.
You're a woman, and of a Iow caste.
silence.
Bandits know no caste.
Those two called themselves bandits, too.
They raped me... stripped me and...
I know.
I am sorry.
But now what?
Your men are mostly muslims.
They do not yet believe in caste.
But soon the caste thing will turn the whole bandit kingdom upside-down.
This woman is trouble, Baba.
What does she want?
She wants her own gang.
Let's see what support she has.
Who is with this woman?
I am.
And I.
I'm with Man Singh.
Man Singh, you've always wanted your own gang.
You now have a partner.
Go ahead.
What can a woman do?
And a share for my other gun?
An extra gun always gets an extra share.
police uniforms.
Twenty-five.
And 16 guns.
- How many don't work?
- Five.
Twenty-five men, sixteen guns, five duds... and you want to raid Jangamajpur.
There'II be at Ieast 50 policemen.
Even Mushtaquim wouldn't try this.
Vikram would.
people of Jangamajpur, listen carefully!
This is the Man Singh and PhooIan gang.
The poor have nothing to fear.
Anyone who tries to stop us or close their shops will be shot.
Women and children, go in, do not be scared.
Open up!
Out of here, motherfucker!
The police!
What?
Run, PhooIan!
The police are here!
You want me, bastards?
Here I am!
- What's your name?
- Damayanti.
- What does your father do?
- He drinks.
Want to come with me?
Keep this.
For your wedding.
Long live PhooIan Devi!
Love live Baba Mushtaquim!
Your name echoes throughout the land.
You are considered a terror.
With your blessings, Baba.
I have news.
- There's only one thing I want to hear.
- I know.
sriram and LaIaRam will be attending a wedding.
- Where?
- Behmai.
Listen.
Don't do anything rash.
people of Behmai!
We've come for sriram and LaIaRam.
We know they are here.
Surrender quietly.
Any resistance will be met with bullets.
Women and children need not fear.
We've come for sriram and LaIaRam.
Find them!
Smash the doors.
Bring every man out.
Don't touch women and children.
They watched the fun while I was raped.
Sisterfucking Thakurs!
You took my honor here.
Where is your leader?
I don't know.
Where's he hiding?
- Don't know.
- tell me!
I swear I don't know!
Where's your leader, sisterfucker?
What prospect is there of catching PhooIan Devi and her gang?
She's a woman, Iow caste.
We'II catch her sooner or later.
You journalists are giving her unnecessary publicity.
She didn't get sriram and LaIaRam.
She killed 24 innocent Thakurs.
I, too, have killed, but not for nothing.
The place is crawling with cops...
like lice in a beggar's blanket.
Soon they'II set the army on us.
Each of those dead Thakurs will have some fucking relative in the government.
She'II die a horrible death.
Worms will feed on her corpse.
bloody bitch goddess.
One stupid low caste woman... in a God forsaken place I can't even find in the map... is threatening to bring down our state government.
You know how strong is Thakur's lobby in our state?
We are doing our best, sir.
She will be dead soon.
Dead?
Whoever said anything about killing?
You know the kind of following she has amongst lower castes.
They do vote, you know?
What are my orders, sir?
Have you heard something called surrender?
I just can't understand!
We've surrendered.
Don't shoot!
Where are the others?
police attack... at river...
all dead.
Speak clearly.
Run away.
Don't go near water.
Look at this.
You brought bullets?
He says it's all over.
So he turns coward at the first sign of danger.
- I've seen enough corpses.
- Look carefully.
Bharat and Madho.
Shot them from this close.
Munna ran.
Shot him in the legs.
Then a bayonet through his throat.
Girdhari had one bullet.
Shot himself.
The police went to Ateek and sultan's village.
They were stripped naked and killed in front of their families.
The police say they will kill us all... unless you surrender.
They've poisoned the water.
KaiIash, have you got guns?
I've got water.
KaiIash, you've come to help me, haven't you?
KaiIash, wait.
My gang will come.
will you bring them?
Hey, my baIdy!
No one will come.
They're all dead.
I'II form a new gang or join another gang.
They will kill you... and me, too.
Why, you, my old baldy?
I'm your cousin, that's why.
I am PhooIan Devi!
Queen of these ravines.
I will stay here.
The ravines will hide me in their womb.
They cannot hide you now.
Come on out.
It's time to be reborn again.
Time to face the real world.
- Dad wants you.
- I've brought two buckets of water.
Come out, you whore!
I can smell you, filthy bitch!
You stink even worse.
I'II give you more pleasure than Vikram could.
We know you are rotting, you have no bullets.
The press makes you out to be some kind of a goddess.
But you're good for only one thing now.
You know what, don't you?
Remember my rod?
You must be longing for it.
Lots of people want you naked here, even more than Behmai.
Motherfucker!
We killed Vikram.
Now Man Singh will die because of you.
Let's move on.
Get away!
Don't come near me!
Go and surrender!
I'II tell Vikram you're a coward!
He'II beat you!
The goddess is angry with me.
There were bullets for everyone.
For Bharat, for Madho.
There are no bullets for me.
I want my mother.
I want my father.
My terms of surrender:
Our families must be protected... and given land to live.
After release, we should be given gun licenses for our security.
AII our children... should be given free education.
The famous bandit PhooIan Devi.... and her gang will surrender... before the Chief Minister.
The bandit PhooIan Devi...
We should be kept in open jails and released after eight years.
Long live PhooIan Devi!
I am PhooIan Devi, you sisterfuckers!

The thing I admire about the Chinese is they're hanging in there with the chopsticks.
Because if you think about it, they've seen the fork by now.
I'm sure they've seen the spoon.
They're going, "Yeah, they're okay.
We're gonna stay with the sticks."
I mean, I don't know how they missed it.
Thousands of years ago, Chinese farmer gets up has his breakfast with the chopsticks goes out and works all day in the field with a shovel.
Hello?
Shovel?
Not going out there plowing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues.
Good shave today.
Don't worry, I can manage these bags.
Really, I'm fine.
I'm thinking of letting my sideburns grow in.
Can we rest here a second?
Yeah, I guess.
- So how's Noreen?
- She got a new boyfriend.
Paul.
Already?
That was fast.
I assume he's not a high-talker.
No, but he has the worst habit.
Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on.
You have to go through 10 minutes of chit-chat.
- A long-talker.
- Yeah.
He is so boring.
Now whenever he answers the phone, I just hang up.
All right, let's move it out.
Hey, isn't that George's father?
Oh, yeah, it is.
Should we say hello?
I've never seen him in Manhattan before.
It's weird.
It's so out of context.
That man he's with is he wearing a cape?
I believe he is wearing a cape.
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
Well, it is good cape weather.
Cool, breezy.
Why a cape?
Who wears a cape?
Where do you even get a cape?
You're right, it is strange.
In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street.
Cover me.
Just plop it on the counter there.
Oh, I got a message.
Hey, it's George,
I got nothing to say,
That sounds urgent.
Let me call him back.
Hello?
Who is this?
Donna Chang?
I'm sorry.
I must have dialed the wrong number.
Donna Chang?
Should've talked.
I love Chinese women.
Isn't that a little racist?
If I like their race, how can that be racist?
Hello?
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?
Yes, I am calling George.
Oh, the lines are crossed.
You're getting his calls.
Well, what do you know.
- Hi.
- So listen...
I'm going through this stuff like water.
- Who are you talking to?
- He's on with a Chinese woman.
You know, I dig Asian women.
You got a comfort problem there?
No, I think these Jockeys shrunk.
- I thought you wore silk underwear.
- No.
I wore them for a month, but I couldn't stick with it.
I need the secure packaging of Jockeys.
My boys need a house.
That's nice.
Listen, if you ever wanna have kids, you shouldn't wear briefs.
Boxers are much better for your sperm count.
Sperm count?
Well, how many sperm should I have?
A lot.
I got a date.
- With the Chinese woman?
- She knew who I was.
She saw me at a club one time.
My first date ever with the Pacific Rim.
I'm very excited.
Jerry, you ever have your sperm count checked?
No, why should I?
I wear boxers.
You ever get a woman pregnant?
I'm sorry, Kramer.
Those records are permanently sealed.
What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?
Really?
You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years?
I'm surprised.
You've slept with a lot of women.
A lot of women!
Do you think maybe I'm depleted?
Well, I'm sure you're not totally depleted.
But what if I am?
I'm the last male Kramer.
We're facing extinction.
Go to a fertility clinic, check your sperm count.
Yeah, but then I'd have to...
Well, you know...
Into a cup in the middle of the day?
What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?
All right, I'm gonna try Noreen again.
I am very excited about this date.
We're going to Hunan Balcony.
She's Chinese, so you suggest Chinese food?
- She suggested it.
- I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese.
She's very assimilated.
Hello,
- Paul again?
- You can't get one ring past him.
- Hey, hey.
You don't call me back?
- I tried.
Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman.
Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.
What's he doing in the city today?
You didn't ask him?
- You didn't say hello?
- Well, he was with someone a man in a cape.
Why was he wearing a cape?
Was my father wearing a cape?
No, jacket and tie.
No cape.
A cape.
What was a man with a cape doing with my father?
What was my father doing with a man in a cape?
Why a cape?
The results of your sperm test are in.
Are you planning to start a family?
Yes, I would like to very much.
I'm low, aren't I?
I can feel it.
- Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.
- Oh, man!
It's over.
The Kramer name is finished.
- I'm never gonna procreate, huh?
- That's not necessarily true.
There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.
All right, what?
What?
You tell me.
I'll do anything.
Come on, tell me.
First thing, you should wear boxer shorts.
- All the time?
- All the time.
You have to get off Jockeys right away.
But I've always worn Jockeys.
Hi, Paul, it's Elaine calling.
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone, so I don't really have time to talk.
Is Noreen there?
Oh, she's not?
Okay, great.
Well, you can just tell her I called then, and...
Well, yes, it has been unseasonably cool lately.
Okay.
Well, look, I'm pulling up to the building now, so I'm gonna...
Yeah, I tip 20 percent too.
Lookit, Paul, the car seems to be running out of gas so I'm gonna have to get off the phone.
Please let me know when your party has arrived.
Yes, I will.
- You mind?
- No, go ahead.
I secondhand smoke two packs a day.
Jerry.
- Excuse me?
- Hi, sorry I'm late.
- Who are you?
- I'm Donna Chang.
What do you mean?
I mean I'm Donna Chang.
You're Donna Chang?
Did you think I was Chinese?
No.
What, you mean because of the "Chang"?
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.
- I didn't think so.
- Used to be "Changstein."
- She's not Chinese?
- No, not Chinese.
Not even Asian.
- So, what is she?
- Well, she's like you.
Oh, how disappointed you must have been.
Well, it's false advertising, see?
And the thing is, I think she likes people thinking she's Chinese.
She suggests Chinese food she always introduces herself as Donna Chang.
So why are you seeing her again?
Well, she is a woman.
Listen, I spoke to Paul and Noreen.
They might be breaking up.
- Really?
- Well, maybe.
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul and Noreen broke up because you kept hanging up on him?
- What do you mean?
- Lf Paul thought it was some guy hanging up because he was having an affair with Noreen.
Here, take my Jockey shorts.
Hey, what is that?
Look, you gotta help me.
I have to get off Jockey shorts.
- What, you have low sperm count?
- Very low.
- Come on, take them.
- I don't want them.
Jerry, look, you gotta help.
If I have one pair in my house, I'll wear them.
- I don't want them.
- All it takes is one pair.
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house.
Boxers!
How do you wear these things?
Look at that.
They're bagging up.
They're rising here.
And there's nothing holding me in place.
I'm flipping, I'm flopping.
What am I gonna do?
Jerry, I'm going crazy in these things.
Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
You know what I like about Manhattan?
There's no mosquitoes.
There's plenty of mosquitoes.
Queens is full of mosquitoes.
- So, Dad...
- Gnats, too, if I'm not mistaken.
Heard you were in the city the other day.
Your mother has to tell you every move I make?
I'll kill her.
- Jerry and Elaine saw you.
- They didn't say hello?
- They were in a rush.
- They couldn't just say hello?
Ah, the hell with them.
They said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape.
Elaine, I can see not saying hello.
She's very...
What's the word?
Supercilious.
- So, Dad...
- How could Jerry not say hello?
- Did they uncross the lines yet?
- They can't find the problem.
It's really getting ridicurous.
Did you say "ridicurous"?
Ridiculous.
I thought you said ridicurous.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you.
I didn't know you had company.
- Oh, no, no.
- Hi, I'm George.
- Oh, hi.
- I'm Donna Chang.
I just spoke to your mother before.
- You spoke to my mother?
- She was trying to call you, but...
The rines are crossed.
Did you say the "rines" are crossed?
Did I?
George, she's so sweet.
We talked for an hour.
Anyway, I'm really sorry.
Sorry, why sorry?
What do you have to be sorry about?
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.
Boy, divorced.
That's really too bad.
Yeah.
You know, it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced 30 years ago.
He could've been normal.
Oh, my God!
You know what I just realized?
If they get divorced and live in two separate places that's twice as many visits.
I never thought of that.
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day.
It's like running a double marathon.
Hey, Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?
Have you ever spent any time with these people?
- You know what this has to do with?
- What?
The man in the cape.
I bet you he is mixed up in this.
I don't trust men in capes.
You can't cast dispersions on someone just because they're wearing a cape.
Superman wore a cape.
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here and let you say something bad about him.
All right, Superman's the exception.
Hey, Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up.
I want you to put in a good word for me.
Always had a thing for Noreen.
No, Kramer, you don't understand, this could be my fault.
Well, if she's available, I won't let her slip through my fingers this time.
Well, looks like you've adjusted to the boxers.
Well, I wouldn't go as far as that.
- You went back to the Jockeys?
- Wrong again.
Oh, no.
What?
What?
Don't you see what's going on here?
No boxers, no Jockeys.
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine.
- Kramer, say it isn't so.
- Oh, it be so.
I'm out there, Jerry, and I'm loving every minute of it!
Don't you need a little help?
Surprisingly, no.
I'm free.
I'm unfettered.
I feel like a naked, innocent boy roaming the countryside.
So you guys are trying to work it out.
That's great.
Yeah, well, we're trying, but he just went insane there for a while.
He went insane?
Believe it or not Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered.
What kind of a sick person calls and hangs up over and over?
Well I don't know about sick.
I mean, maybe it was somebody who didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat and was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling didn't wanna speak to them.
I can't believe that was you.
I'm really sorry, Noreen.
So you thought he was boring?
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me.
What are you doing to this woman?
This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks.
- I know.
- First you ruin her relationship with the high-talker.
- Well, I got confused.
They sound exactly the same.
So she breaks up with him.
Somehow picks up the pieces of her life miraculously meets a new guy.
You bust that up.
And then just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world he's boring.
I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
Apparently, you have a tremendous influence over this woman.
Anything you say, she does.
- Yeah?
- It's Donna Chang.
- Come on up.
- I guess I just didn't realize it.
Well, let's look back at your history with this woman.
- Okay?
- Okay.
First, you encouraged her to join the army.
She did.
She was lost.
Then you suggest she goes AWOL.
She did.
Well, she didn't seem to be having so much fun.
Make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.
If I have this much influence, I'll call her and tell her to get back together with him.
- Hey.
- Oh, Miss Changstein.
- This is Elaine.
- Hi.
How are you?
Guess what?
Mrs. Costanza called me.
- They're not getting divorced.
- Why, what happened?
She was trying to call George last night, she got me we spoke for an hour, and she changed her mind.
- Wow, that's amazing.
- Anyway, she wants to meet me.
She invited me over for dinner.
Said you should come too.
- Tonight?
- Yeah.
I just remembered.
I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class.
All right, let me just say one thing.
There is no way that this is gonna happen.
No way!
Because if you think I'm going to two Thanksgivings you're out of your mind!
- We're not getting divorced.
- Your mother changed her mind.
You did?
That's good.
That's very good.
- I'm very glad to hear that.
- Yeah, we worked it out.
All right, so let me ask you a question.
Who was the man in the cape?
- He was my lawyer.
- Your lawyer wears a cape?
Yeah.
So what?
- Who wears a cape?
- He's very independent.
He doesn't follow the trends.
He looks ridiculous in that thing.
You have no eye for fashion!
- I have no eye for fashion?
- All right.
Come on.
Let's not fight.
- All right, all right.
- All right.
Georgie's right.
So, what made you change your mind?
It was that Chinese woman.
What did you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
Mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.
- Confucius, huh?
- Yeah.
You know, you're not Chinese.
Hey, I heard the good news.
Jerry, how come you didn't say hello to me the other day?
- Elaine was in a rush.
- I knew it was Elaine.
- You must be Estelle.
- Yes.
Who are you?
I'm Donna Chang.
You're not Chinese.
Hello?
- Paul?
- Elaine.
Kramer?
Yeah!
- What are you doing there?
- Well, isn't it obvious?
- Is Noreen there?
- Yes, she is,
Well, can I talk to her?
What, am I too boring for you?
Would you just put her on?
I feel it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while.
- You feel?
- That's right,
She and I have had a very long talk.
And I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years.
- What, are you insane?
- From now on, I'll be calling the shots.
And what are you gonna tell her?
Well, I've encouraged her to go back into the army.
There she'll get the structure and discipline she needs right now.
And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do.
Kramer, you have got to let me talk to her.
Can't help you, kid.
- You're not Chinese?
- No.
- I thought you were Chinese.
- I'm from Long Island.
Long Island?
I thought I was getting advice from a Chinese woman.
- I'm sorry.
- Well, then that changes everything.
- What?
She's not Chinese.
I was duped!
So what?
She still gave you advice.
What's the difference?
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island.
Now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?
You want a divorce?
You got one!
You know, you might wanna think about changing your name.
Ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me.
Well, Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.
Everybody listens to the Chinese.
Look at the fortune cookie.
You couldn't get away with that at other restaurants.
Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish.
Well, it had to happen.
I knew it.
I predicted it.
Saw both of them today.
What a disaster.
I'm running all over Queens.
First, I saw my mother.
We had lunch together.
I never had lunch with my mother before.
It's like a date.
Then we drive down to Kew Gardens, tons of traffic, I see my father.
We played Clue.
All day with this!
Hey, Jerry!
Guess what?
The Kramer name might live on!
Noreen's late!
She's late!
- Who are you?
- I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer.
The thing I admire about the Chinese is they're hanging in there with the chopsticks.
Because if you think about it, they've seen the fork by now.
I'm sure they've seen the spoon.
They're going, "Yeah, they're okay.
We're gonna stay with the sticks."
I mean, I don't know how they missed it.
Thousands of years ago, Chinese farmer gets up has his breakfast with the chopsticks goes out and works all day in the field with a shovel.
Hello?
Shovel?
Not going out there ploughing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues.
Good shave today.
Don't worry, I can manage these bags.
Really, I'm fine.
I'm thinking of letting my sideburns grow in.
- Can we rest here a second?
- Yeah, I guess.
- So how's Noreen?
- She got a new boyfriend.
Paul.
Already?
That was fast.
I assume he's not a high-talker.
No, but he has the worst habit.
Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on.
You must go through 10 minutes of chit-chat.
- A long-talker.
- Yeah.
He is so boring.
Now whenever he answers the phone, I just hang up.
All right, let's move it out.
Hey, isn't that George's father?
Oh, yeah, it is.
Should we say hello?
I've never seen him in Manhattan before.
It's weird.
It's so out of context.
That man he's with is he wearing a cape?
I believe he is wearing a cape.
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
Well, it is good cape weather.
Cool, breezy.
Why a cape?
Who wears a cape?
Where do you even get a cape?
You're right, it is strange.
In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street.
Cover me.
Just plop it on the counter there.
Oh, I got a message.
Hey, it's George.
I got nothing to say.
That sounds urgent.
Let me call him back.
Hello?
Who is this?
Donna Chang?
I'm sorry.
I must have dialled the wrong number.
Donna Chang?
Should've talked.
I love Chinese women.
Isn't that a little racist?
If I like their race, how can that be racist?
Hello?
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?
Yes, I am calling George.
Oh, the lines are crossed.
You're getting his calls.
Well, what do you know.
- Hi.
- So listen...
I'm going through this stuff like water.
- Who are you talking to?
- He's on with a Chinese woman.
You know, I dig Asian women.
You got a comfort problem there?
No, I think these Jockeys shrunk.
- I thought you wore silk underwear.
- No.
I wore them for a month, but I couldn't stick with it.
I need the secure packaging of Jockeys.
My boys need a house.
That's nice.
Listen, if you ever wanna have kids, you shouldn't wear briefs.
Boxers are better for your sperm count.
Sperm count?
Well, how many sperm should I have?
A lot.
I got a date.
- With the Chinese woman?
- She knew who I was.
She saw me at a club one time.
My first date ever with the Pacific Rim.
I'm very excited.
Jerry, you ever have your sperm count checked?
No, why should I?
I wear boxers.
You ever get a woman pregnant?
I'm sorry, Kramer.
Those records are permanently sealed.
What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?
Really?
Never slipped one past the goalie in all these years?
I'm surprised.
You've slept with a lot of women.
A lot of women!
Do you think maybe I'm depleted?
Well, I'm sure you're not totally depleted.
But what if I am?
I'm the last male Kramer.
We're facing extinction.
Go to a fertility clinic, check your sperm count.
Yeah, but then I'd have to- Well, you know...
Into a cup in the middle of the day?
What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?
All right, I'm gonna try Noreen again.
I am very excited about this date.
We're going to Hunan Balcony.
She's Chinese, so you suggest Chinese food?
- She suggested it.
- I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese.
She's very assimilated.
Helo.
- Paul again?
- You can't get one ring past him.
- Hey, hey.
You don't call me back?
- I tried.
Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman.
Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.
What's he doing in the city today?
You didn't ask him?
- You didn't say hello?
- Well, he was with someone a man in a cape.
Why was he wearing a cape?
Was my father wearing a cape?
No, jacket and tie.
No cape.
A cape.
What was a man with a cape doing with my father?
What was my father doing with a man in a cape?
Why a cape?
The results of your sperm test are in.
Are you planning to start a family?
Yes, I would like to very much.
I'm low, aren't I?
I can feel it.
- Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.
- Oh, man!
It's over.
The Kramer name is finished.
- I'm never gonna procreate, huh?
- That's not necessarily true.
There are measures you can take to improve fertility.
All right, what?
What?
You tell me.
I'll do anything.
Come on, tell me.
First thing, you should wear boxer shorts.
- All the time?
- All the time.
You have to get off Jockeys right away.
But I've always worn Jockeys.
Hi, Paul, it's Elaine calling.
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone, so I don't really have time to talk.
Is Noreen there?
She's not?
Okay, great.
Well, you can just tell her I called then, and-
Well, yes, it has been unseasonably cool lately.
Okay.
Well, look, I'm pulling up to the building now, so I'm gonna...
Yeah, I tip 20 percent too.
Lookit, Paul, the car seems to be running out of gas so I'm gonna have to get off the phone.
Please let me know when your party has arrived.
Yes, I will.
- You mind?
- No, go ahead.
I secondhand smoke two packs a day.
Jerry.
- Excuse me?
- Hi, sorry I'm late.
- Who are you?
- I'm Donna Chang.
What do you mean?
I mean I'm Donna Chang.
- You're Donna Chang?
- Did you think I was Chinese?
No.
What, you mean because of the "Chang"?
The family name wasn't originally Chang.
- I didn't think so.
- Used to be Changstein.
- She's not Chinese?
- No, not Chinese.
Not even Asian.
- So, what is she?
- Well, she's like you.
Oh, how disappointed you must have been.
Well, it's false advertising, see?
And the thing is, I think she likes people thinking she's Chinese.
She suggests Chinese food she always introduces herself as Donna Chang.
- So why are you seeing her again?
- Well, she is a woman.
Listen, I spoke to Paul and Noreen.
They might be breaking up.
- Really?
- Well, maybe.
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul and Noreen broke up because you kept hanging up on him?
- What do you mean?
- If Paul thought it was some guy hanging up because he was having an affair with Noreen.
Here, take my Jockey shorts.
Hey, what is that?
Look, you gotta help me.
I have to get off Jockey shorts.
- What, you have low sperm count?
- Very low.
- Come on, take them.
- I don't want them.
Jerry, look, you gotta help.
If I have one pair in my house, I'll wear them.
- I don't want them.
- All it takes is one pair.
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house.
Boxers!
How do you wear these things?
Look at that.
They're bagging up.
They're rising here.
And there's nothing holding me in place.
I'm flipping, I'm flopping.
What am I gonna do?
Jerry, I'm going crazy in these things.
Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
You know what I like about Manhattan?
There's no mosquitoes.
There's plenty of mosquitoes.
Queens is full of mosquitoes.
- So, Dad-
- Gnats too, if I'm not mistaken.
Heard you were in the city the other day.
Your mother has to tell you every move I make?
I'll kill her.
- Jerry and Elaine saw you.
- They didn't say hello?
- They were in a rush.
- They couldn't just say hello?
The hell with them.
They said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape.
Elaine, I can see not saying hello.
She's very- What's the word?
Supercilious.
- So, Dad-
- How could Jerry not say hello?
- Did they uncross the lines yet?
- They can't find the problem.
It's getting ridicurous.
Did you say "ridicurous"?
Ridiculous.
I thought you said ridicurous.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you.
Didn't know you had company.
- Oh, no, no.
- Hi, I'm George.
Oh, hi.
I'm Donna Chang.
I just spoke to your mother before.
- You spoke to my mother?
- She was trying to call you, but-
The rines are crossed.
Did you say the "rines" are crossed?
Did I?
George, she's so sweet.
We talked for an hour.
Anyway, I'm really sorry.
Sorry?
Why sorry?
What do you have to be sorry about?
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.
Boy, divorced.
That's really too bad.
Yeah.
You know, it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced 30 years ago.
He could've been normal.
Oh, my God!
You know what I just realized?
If they get divorced and live in two separate places that's twice as many visits.
I never thought of that.
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day.
It's like running a double marathon.
Hey, Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?
Have you ever spent any time with these people?
- You know what this has to do with?
- What?
The man in the cape.
I bet you he is mixed up in this.
I don't trust men in capes.
You can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearing a cape.
Superman wore a cape.
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here and let you say something bad about him.
All right, Superman's the exception.
Hey, Elaine, I heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up.
I want you to put in a good word for me.
Always had a thing for Noreen.
No, Kramer, you don't understand, this could be my fault.
Well, if she's available, I won't let her slip through my fingers this time.
Well, looks like you've adjusted to the boxers.
Well, I wouldn't go as far as that.
- You went back to the Jockeys?
- Wrong again.
Oh, no.
What?
What?
Don't you see what's going on here?
No boxers, no Jockeys.
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine.
- Kramer, say it isn't so.
- Oh, it be so.
I'm out there, Jerry, and I'm loving every minute of it!
Don't you need a little help?
Surprisingly, no.
I'm free.
I'm unfettered.
I feel like a naked, innocent boy roaming the countryside.
So you guys are trying to work it out.
That's great.
Yeah, well, we're trying, but he just went insane there for a while.
He went insane?
Believe it or not Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up when he answered.
What kind of a sick person calls and hangs up over and over?
Well I don't know about sick.
I mean, maybe it was somebody who didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat and was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling didn't wanna speak to them.
I can't believe that was you.
I'm really sorry, Noreen.
So you thought he was boring?
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me.
What are you doing to this woman?
This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks.
- I know.
- First you ruin her relationship...
- ... with the high-talker.
- Well, I got confused.
They sound exactly the same.
So she breaks up with him.
Somehow picks up the pieces of her life miraculously meets a new guy.
You bust that up.
And then just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world he's boring.
I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
Apparently, you have a tremendous influence over this woman.
Anything you say, she does.
- Yeah?
- It's Donna Chang.
- Come up.
- I guess I just didn't realize it.
Well, let's look back at your history with this woman.
- Okay?
- Okay.
First, you encouraged her to join the Army.
She did.
She was lost.
Then you suggest she goes AWOL.
She did.
She didn't seem to be having so much fun.
Make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.
If I have this much influence, I'll call her and tell her to get back together with him.
- Hey.
- Oh, Miss Changstein.
- This is Elaine.
- Hello.
Hi.
How are you?
Guess what?
Mrs. Costanza called me.
- They're not getting divorced.
- Why, what happened?
She was trying to call George last night, she got me we spoke an hour, and changed her mind.
- Wow, that's amazing.
- Anyway, she wants to meet me.
She invited me for dinner.
Said you should come too.
- Tonight?
- Yeah.
I just remembered.
I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class.
All right, let me just say one thing.
There is no way that this is gonna happen.
No way!
Because if you think I'm going to two Thanksgivings you're out of your mind!
- We're not getting divorced.
- Your mother changed her mind.
You did?
That's good.
That's very good.
- I'm very glad to hear that.
- Yeah.
We worked it out.
All right, let me ask a question.
Who was the man in the cape?
- He was my lawyer.
- Your lawyer wears a cape?
Yeah.
So what?
- Who wears a cape?
- He's very independent.
He doesn't follow the trends.
He looks ridiculous in that thing.
You have no eye for fashion!
- I have no eye for fashion?
- All right.
Come on.
Let's not fight.
- All right, all right.
- All right.
Georgie's right.
So, what made you change your mind?
It was that Chinese woman.
What did you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
Mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.
- Confucius, huh?
- Yeah.
You know, you're not Chinese.
Hey, I heard the good news.
Jerry, how come you didn't say hello to me the other day?
- Elaine was in a rush.
- I knew it was Elaine.
You must be Estelle.
- Yes.
Who are you?
- I'm Donna Chang.
You're not Chinese.
Hello?
- Paul?
- Elaine.
Kramer?
Yeah!
- What are you doing there?
- Well, isn't it obvious?
- Is Noreen there?
- Yes, she is.
Well, can I talk to her?
What, am I too boring for you?
All right.
Would you just put her on?
I feel it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while.
- You feel?
- That's right.
She and I have had a very long talk.
And I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years.
- What, are you insane?
- From now on, I'll be calling the shots.
And what are you gonna tell her?
Well, I've encouraged her to go back into the Army.
There she'll get the structure and discipline she needs right now.
And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do.
Kramer, you have got to let me talk to her.
Can't help you, kid.
- You're not Chinese?
- No.
- I thought you were Chinese.
- I'm from Long Island.
Long Island?
I thought I was getting advice from a Chinese woman.
- I'm sorry.
- Well, then...
- ... that changes everything.
- What?
She's not Chinese.
I was duped!
So what?
She still gave you advice.
What's the difference?
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island.
Now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?
You want a divorce?
You got one!
You know, you might wanna think about changing your name.
Ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't talk to me.
Noreen listened to you like George's mother listens to the Chinese.
Everybody listens to the Chinese.
Look at the fortune cookie.
You couldn't get away with that at other restaurants.
Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish.
Well, it had to happen.
I knew it.
I predicted it.
Saw both of them today.
What a disaster.
I'm running all over Queens.
First, I saw my mother.
We had lunch together.
I never had lunch with my mother before.
It's like a date.
Then we drive down to Kew Gardens, tons of traffic, I see my father.
We played Clue.
All day with this!
Hey, Jerry!
Guess what?
The Kramer name might live on!
Noreen's late!
She's late!
- Who are you?
- I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer.

Isn't that a little racist?
If I like their race, how can that be racist?
Hello?
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?
Yes, I am calling George.
Oh, the lines are crossed.
You're getting his calls.
Well, what do you know.
-Hi.
-So listen....
I'm going through this stuff like water.

She suggests Chinese food she always introduces herself as Donna Chang.
So why are you seeing her again?
Well, she is a woman.
Listen, I spoke to Paul and Noreen.
They might be breaking up.
-Really?
-Well, maybe.
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul and Noreen broke up because you kept hanging up on him?
-What do you mean?
-lf Paul thought it was some guy hanging up because he was having an affair with Noreen.
Here, take my Jockey shorts.
Hey, what is that?
Look, you gotta help me.
I have to get off Jockey shorts.

-I don't want them.

If I have one pair in my house, I'll wear them.

The rines are crossed.
Did you say the "rines" are crossed?
Did I?
George, she's so sweet.
We talked for an hour.
Anyway, I'm really sorry.
Sorry, why sorry?
What do you have to be sorry about?
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.
Boy, divorced.
That's really too bad.
Yeah.
You know, it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced 30 years ago.
He could've been normal.
Oh, my God!
You know what I just realized?
If they get divorced and live in two separate places that's twice as many visits.

The man in the cape.
I bet you he is mixed up in this.
I don't trust men in capes.
You can't cast dispersions on someone just because they're wearing a cape.
Superman wore a cape.
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here and let you say something bad about him.
All right, Superman's the exception.
Hey, Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up.
I want you to put in a good word for me.
Always had a thing for Noreen.
No, Kramer, you don't understand, this could be my fault.
Well, if she's available, I won't let her slip through my fingers this time.
Well, looks like you've adjusted to the boxers.
Well, I wouldn't go as far as that.
-You went back to the Jockeys?
-Wrong again.
Oh, no.
What?
What?
Don't you see what's going on here?
No boxers, no Jockeys.
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine.
-Kramer, say it isn't so.
-Oh, it be so.
I'm out there, Jerry, and I'm loving every minute of it!
Don't you need a little help?
Surprisingly, no.
I'm free.
I'm unfettered.
I feel like a naked, innocent boy roaming the countryside.
So you guys are trying to work it out.
That's great.
Yeah, well, we're trying, but he just went insane there for a while.
He went insane?
Believe it or not Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered.
What kind of a sick person calls and hangs up over and over?
Well I don't know about sick.
I mean, maybe it was somebody who didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat and was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling didn't wanna speak to them.
I can't believe that was you.
I'm really sorry, Noreen.
So you thought he was boring?
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me.
What are you doing to this woman?
This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks.
-I know.
-First you ruin her relationship...
-...with the high-talker.
-Well, I got confused.
They sound exactly the same.
So she breaks up with him.
Somehow picks up the pieces of her life miraculously meets a new guy.
You bust that up.
And then just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world he's boring.
I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
Apparently, you have a tremendous influence over this woman.
Anything you say, she does.
-Yeah?
-It's Donna Chang.
-Come on up.
-I guess I just didn't realize it.
Well, let's look back at your history with this woman.
-Okay?
-Okay.
First, you encouraged her to join the army.
She did.
She was lost.
Then you suggest she goes AWOL.
She did.
Well, she didn't seem to be having so much fun.
Make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.
If I have this much influence, I'll call her and tell her to get back together with him.
-Hey.
-Oh, Miss Changstein.
-This is Elaine.
-Hi.
How are you?
Guess what?
Mrs. Costanza called me.
-They're not getting divorced.
-Why, what happened?
She was trying to call George last night, she got me we spoke for an hour, and she changed her mind.
-Wow, that's amazing.
-Anyway, she wants to meet me.
She invited me over for dinner.
Said you should come too.
-Tonight?
-Yeah.
I just remembered.
I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class.
All right, let me just say one thing.
There is no way that this is gonna happen.
No way!
Because if you think I'm going to two Thanksgivings you're out of your mind!
-We're not getting divorced.
-Your mother changed her mind.
You did?
That's good.
That's very good.
-I'm very glad to hear that.
-Yeah, we worked it out.
All right, so let me ask you a question.
Who was the man in the cape?
-He was my lawyer.
-Your lawyer wears a cape?
Yeah.
So what?
-Who wears a cape?
-He's very independent.
He doesn't follow the trends.
He looks ridiculous in that thing.
You have no eye for fashion!
-I have no eye for fashion?
-All right.
Come on.
Let's not fight.
-All right, all right.
-All right.
Georgie's right.
So, what made you change your mind?
It was that Chinese woman.
What did you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
Mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.
-Confucius, huh?
-Yeah.
You know, you're not Chinese.
Hey, I heard the good news.
Jerry, how come you didn't say hello to me the other day?
-Elaine was in a rush.
-I knew it was Elaine.
-You must be Estelle.
-Yes.
Who are you?
I'm Donna Chang.
You're not Chinese.
Hello?
-Paul?
-Elaine.
Kramer?
Yeah!
-What are you doing there?
-Well, isn't it obvious?
-Is Noreen there?
-Yes, she is.
Well, can I talk to her?
What, am I too boring for you?
Would you just put her on?
I feel it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while.
-You feel?
-That's right.
She and I have had a very long talk.
And I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years.
-What, are you insane?
-From now on, I'll be calling the shots.
And what are you gonna tell her?
Well, I've encouraged her to go back into the army.
There she'll get the structure and discipline she needs right now.
And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do.
Kramer, you have got to let me talk to her.
Can't help you, kid.
-You're not Chinese?
-No.
-I thought you were Chinese.
-I'm from Long Island.
Long Island?
I thought I was getting advice from a Chinese woman.
-I'm sorry.
-Well, then...
-...that changes everything.
-What?
She's not Chinese.
I was duped!
So what?
She still gave you advice.
What's the difference?
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island.
Now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?
You want a divorce?
You got one!
You know, you might wanna think about changing your name.
Ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me.
Well, Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.
Everybody listens to the Chinese.
Look at the fortune cookie.
You couldn't get away with that at other restaurants.
Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish.
Well, it had to happen.
I knew it.
I predicted it.
Saw both of them today.
What a disaster.
I'm running all over Queens.
First, I saw my mother.
We had lunch together.
I never had lunch with my mother before.
It's like a date.
Then we drive down to Kew Gardens, tons of traffic, I see my father.
We played Clue.
All day with this!
Hey, Jerry!
Guess what?
The Kramer name might live on!
Noreen's late!
She's late!
-Who are you?
-I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer.
The thing I admire about the Chinese is they're hanging in there with the chopsticks.
Because if you think about it, they've seen the fork by now.
I'm sure they've seen the spoon.
They're going, "Yeah, they're okay.
We're gonna stay with the sticks."
I mean, I don't know how they missed it.
Thousands of years ago, Chinese farmer gets up has his breakfast with the chopsticks goes out and works all day in the field with a shovel.
Hello?
Shovel?
Not going out there plowing 40 acres with a couple of pool cues.
Good shave today.
Don't worry, I can manage these bags.
Really, I'm fine.
I'm thinking of letting my sideburns grow in.
Can we rest here a second?
Yeah, I guess.
- So how's Noreen?
- She got a new boyfriend.
Paul.
Already?
That was fast.
I assume he's not a high-talker.
No, but he has the worst habit.
Whenever he answers the phone, he won't put Noreen right on.
You have to go through 10 minutes of chit-chat.
- A long-talker.
- Yeah.
He is so boring.
Now whenever he answers the phone, I just hang up.
All right, let's move it out.
Hey, isn't that George's father?
Oh, yeah, it is.
Should we say hello?
I've never seen him in Manattan before.
It's weird.
It's so out of context.
That man he's with is he wearing a cape?
I believe he is wearing a cape.
Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?
Well, it is good cape weather.
Cool, breezy.
Why a cape?
Who wears a cape?
Where do you even get a cape?
You're right, it is strange.
In fact, let's cross to the other side of the street.
Cover me.
Just plop it on the counter there.
Oh, I got a message.
Hey, it's George.
I got nothing to say.
That sounds urgent.
Let me call him back.
Hello?
Who is this?
Donna Chang?
I'm sorry.
I must have dialed the wrong number.
Donna Chang?
Should've talked.
I love Chinese women.
Isn't that a little racist?
If I like their race, how can that be racist?
Hello?
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?
Yes, I am calling George.
Oh, the lines are crossed.
You're getting his calls.
Well, what do you know.
- Hi.
- So listen...
I'm going through this stuff like water.
- Who are you talking to?
- He's on with a Chinese woman.
You know, I dig Asian women.
You got a comfort problem there?
No, I think these Jockeys shrunk.
- I thought you wore silk underwear.
- No.
I wore them for a month, but I couldn't stick with it.
I need the secure packaging of Jockeys.
My boys need a house.
That's nice.
Listen, if you ever wanna have kids, you shouldn't wear briefs.
Boxers are much better for your sperm count.
Sperm count?
Well, how many sperm should I have?
A lot.
I got a date.
- With the Chinese woman?
- She knew who I was.
She saw me at a club one time.
My first date ever with the Pacific Rim.
I'm very excited.
Jerry, you ever have your sperm count checked?
No, why should I?
I wear boxers.
You ever get a woman pregnant?
I'm sorry, Kramer.
Those records are permanently sealed.
What would you say if I told you I never impregnated a woman?
Really?
You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years?
I'm surprised.
You've slept with a lot of women.
A lot of women!
Do you think maybe I'm depleted?
Well, I'm sure you're not totally depleted.
But what if I am?
I'm the last male Kramer.
We're facing extinction.
Go to a fertility clinic, check your sperm count.
Yeah, but then I'd have to...
Well, you know...
Into a cup in the middle of the day?
What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?
All right, I'm gonna try Noreen again.
I am very excited about this date.
We're going to Hunan Balcony.
She's Chinese, so you suggest Chinese food?
- She suggested it.
- I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese.
She's very assimilated.
Hello.
- Paul again?
- You can't get one ring past him.
- Hey, hey.
You don't call me back?
- I tried.
Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman.
Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.
What's he doing in the city today?
You didn't ask him?
- You didn't say hello?
- Well, he was with someone a man in a cape.
Why was he wearing a cape?
Was my father wearing a cape?
No, jacket and tie.
No cape.
A cape.
What was a man with a cape doing with my father?
What was my father doing with a man in a cape?
Why a cape?
The results of your sperm test are in.
Are you planning to start a family?
Yes, I would like to very much.
I'm low, aren't I?
I can feel it.
- Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.
- Oh, man!
It's over.
The Kramer name is finished.
- I'm never gonna procreate, huh?
- That's not necessarily true.
There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.
All right, what?
What?
You tell me.
I'll do anything.
Come on, tell me.
First thing, you should wear boxer shorts.
- All the time?
- All the time.
You have to get off Jockeys right away.
But I've always worn Jockeys.
Hi, Paul, it's Elaine calling.
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone, so I don't really have time to talk.
Is Noreen there?
Oh, she's not?
Okay, great.
Well, you can just tell her I called then, and...
Well, yes, it has been unseasonably cool lately.
Okay.
Well, look, I'm pulling up to the building now, so I'm gonna...
Yeah, I tip 20 percent too.
Lookit, Paul, the car seems to be running out of gas so I'm gonna have to get off the phone.
Please let me know when your party has arrived.
Yes, I will.
- You mind?
- No, go ahead.
I secondhand smoke two packs a day.
Jerry.
- Excuse me?
- Hi, sorry I'm late.
- Who are you?
- I'm Donna Chang.
What do you mean?
I mean I'm Donna Chang.
You're Donna Chang?
Did you think I was Chinese?
No.
What, you mean because of the "Chang"?
Actually, the family name wasrt originally Chang.
- I didn't think so.
- Used to be "Changstein."
- She's not Chinese?
- No, not Chinese.
Not even Asian.
- So, what is she?
- Well, she's like you.
Oh, how disappointed you must have been.
Well, it's false advertising, see?
And the thing is, I think she likes people thinking she's Chinese.
She suggests Chinese food she always introduces herself as Donna Chang.
So why are you seeing her again?
Well, she is a woman.
Listen, I spoke to Paul and Noreen.
They might be breaking up.
- Really?
- Well, maybe.
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul and Noreen broke up because you kept hanging up on him?
- What do you mean?
- Lf Paul thought it was some guy hanging up because he was having an affair with Noreen.
Here, take my Jockey shorts.
Hey, what is that?
Look, you gotta help me.
I have to get off Jockey shorts.
- What, you have low sperm count?
- Very low.
- Come on, take them.
- I don't want them.
Jerry, look, you gotta help.
If I have one pair in my house, I'll wear them.
- I don't want them.
- All it takes is one pair.
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house.
Boxers!
How do you wear these things?
Look at that.
They're bagging up.
They're rising here.
And there's nothing holding me in place.
I'm flipping, I'm flopping.
What am I gonna do?
Jerry, I'm going crazy in these things.
Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
You know what I like about Manattan?
There's no mosquitoes.
There's plenty of mosquitoes.
Queens is full of mosquitoes.
- So, Dad...
- Gnats, too, if I'm not mistaken.
Heard you were in the city the other day.
Your mother has to tell you every move I make?
I'll kill her.
- Jerry and Elaine saw you.
- They didn't say hello?
- They were in a rush.
- They couldn't just say hello?
Ah, the hell with them.
They said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape.
Elaine, I can see not saying hello.
She's very...
What's the word?
Supercilious.
- So, Dad...
- How could Jerry not say hello?
- Did they uncross the lines yet?
- They can't find the problem.
It's really getting ridicurous.
Did you say "ridicurous"?
Ridiculous.
I thought you said ridicurous.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you.
I didn't know you had company.
- Oh, no, no.
- Hi, I'm George.
- Oh, hi.
- I'm Donna Chang.
I just spoke to your mother before.
- You spoke to my mother?
- She was trying to call you, but...
The rines are crossed.
Did you say the "rines" are crossed?
Did I?
George, she's so sweet.
We talked for an hour.
Anyway, I'm really sorry.
Sorry, why sorry?
What do you have to be sorry about?
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.
Boy, divorced.
That's really too bad.
Yeah.
You know, it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced 30 years ago.
He could've been normal.
Oh, my God!
You know what I just realized?
If they get divorced and live in two separate places that's twice as many visits.
I never thought of that.
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day.
It's like running a double marathon.
Hey, Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?
Have you ever spent any time with these people?
- You know what this has to do with?
- What?
The man in the cape.
I bet you he is mixed up in this.
I don't trust men in capes.
You can't cast dispersions on someone just because they're wearing a cape.
Superman wore a cape.
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here and let you say something bad about him.
All right, Supermars the exception.
Hey, Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up.
I want you to put in a good word for me.
Always had a thing for Noreen.
No, Kramer, you don't understand, this could be my fault.
Well, if she's available, I won't let her slip through my fingers this time.
Well, looks like you've adjusted to the boxers.
Well, I wouldn't go as far as that.
- You went back to the Jockeys?
- Wrong again.
Oh, no.
What?
What?
Don't you see what's going on here?
No boxers, no Jockeys.
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine.
- Kramer, say it isn't so.
- Oh, it be so.
I'm out there, Jerry, and I'm loving every minute of it!
Don't you need a little help?
Surprisingly, no.
I'm free.
I'm unfettered.
I feel like a naked, innocent boy roaming the countryside.
So you guys are trying to work it out.
That's great.
Yeah, well, we're trying, but he just went insane there for a while.
He went insane?
Believe it or not Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered.
What kind of a sick person calls and hangs up over and over?
Well I don't know about sick.
I mean, maybe it was somebody who didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat and was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling didn't wanna speak to them.
I can't believe that was you.
I'm really sorry, Noreen.
So you thought he was boring?
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me.
What are you doing to this woman?
This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks.
- I know.
- First you ruin her relationship with the high-talker.
- Well, I got confused.
They sound exactly the same.
So she breaks up with him.
Somehow picks up the pieces of her life miraculously meets a new guy.
You bust that up.
And then just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world he's boring.
I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
Apparently, you have a tremendous influence over this woman.
Anything you say, she does.
- Yeah?
- It's Donna Chang.
- Come on up.
- I guess I just didn't realize it.
Well, let's look back at your history with this woman.
- Okay?
- Okay.
First, you encouraged her to join the army.
She did.
She was lost.
Then you suggest she goes AWOL.
She did.
Well, she didn't seem to be having so much fun.
Make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.
If I have this much influence, I'll call her and tell her to get back together with him.
- Hey.
- Oh, Miss Changstein.
- This is Elaine.
- Hi.
How are you?
Guess what?
Mrs. Costanza called me.
- They're not getting divorced.
- Why, what happened?
She was trying to call George last night, she got me we spoke for an hour, and she changed her mind.
- Wow, that's amazing.
- Anyway, she wants to meet me.
She invited me over for dinner.
Said you should come too.
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class.

There is no way that this is gonna happen.
No way!
Because if you think I'm going to two Thanksgivings you're out of your mind!

- Your mother changed her mind.

That's very good.
- I'm very glad to hear that.

All right, so let me ask you a question.
Who was the man in the cape?
- He was my lawyer.
- Your lawyer wears a cape?
Yeah.
So what?
- Who wears a cape?
- He's very independent.
He doesn't follow the trends.
He looks ridiculous in that thing.
You have no eye for fashion!
- I have no eye for fashion?
- All right.
Come on.
Let's not fight.
- All right, all right.
- All right.
Georgie's right.
So, what made you change your mind?
It was that Chinese woman.
What did you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
Mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.
- Confucius, huh?
- Yeah.
You know, you're not Chinese.

Well, can I talk to her?
What, am I too boring for you?
Would you just put her on?
I feel it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while.
- You feel?
- That's right.
She and I have had a very long talk.
And I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life Io these many years.
- What, are you insane?
- From now on, I'll be calling the shots.
And what are you gonna tell her?
Well, I've encouraged her to go back into the army.
There she'll get the structure and discipline she needs right now.
And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do.
Kramer, you have got to let me talk to her.
Can't help you, kid.
- You're not Chinese?
- No.
- I thought you were Chinese.
- I'm from Long Island.
Long Island?
I thought I was getting advice from a Chinese woman.
- I'm sorry.
- Well, then that changes everything.
- What?
She's not Chinese.
I was duped!
So what?
She still gave you advice.
What's the difference?
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island.
Now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?
You want a divorce?
You got one!
You know, you might wanna think about changing your name.
Ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me.
Well, Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.
Everybody listens to the Chinese.

It's weird.

If I like their race, how can that be racist?
Hello?
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?
Yes, I am calling George.
Oh, the lines are crossed.
You're getting his calls.
Well, what do you know.
- Hi.
- So listen...
I'm going through this stuff like water.
- Who are you talking to?
- He's on with a Chinese woman.
You know, I dig Asian women.
You got a comfort problem there?
No, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

- No.
I wore them for a month, but I couldn't stick with it.

My boys need a house.
That's nice.
Listen, if you ever wanna have kids, you shouldn't wear briefs.
Boxers are much better for your sperm count.
Sperm count?

A lot.

Really?
You never slipped one past the goalie in all these years?
I'm surprised.
You've slept with a lot of women.
A lot of women!
Do you think maybe I'm depleted?
Well, I'm sure you're not totally depleted.
But what if I am?
I'm the last male Kramer.
We're facing extinction.
Go to a fertility clinic, check your sperm count.
Yeah, but then I'd have to...
Well, you know...
Into a cup in the middle of the day?
What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?
All right, I'm gonna try Noreen again.
I am very excited about this date.
We're going to Hunan Balcony.
She's Chinese, so you suggest Chinese food?
- She suggested it.
- I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese.
She's very assimilated.
Hello.
- Paul again?
- You can't get one ring past him.
- Hey, hey.
You don't call me back?
- I tried.
Your line's crossed with a Chinese woman.
Hey, George, we saw your father on the street before.
What's he doing in the city today?
You didn't ask him?
- You didn't say hello?
- Well, he was with someone a man in a cape.
Why was he wearing a cape?
Was my father wearing a cape?
No, jacket and tie.
No cape.
A cape.
What was a man with a cape doing with my father?
What was my father doing with a man in a cape?
Why a cape?
The results of your sperm test are in.
Are you planning to start a family?
Yes, I would like to very much.
I'm low, aren't I?
I can feel it.
- Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.
- Oh, man!
It's over.
The Kramer name is finished.
- I'm never gonna procreate, huh?
- That's not necessarily true.
There are measures you can take to improve your fertility.
All right, what?
What?
You tell me.
I'll do anything.
Come on, tell me.
First thing, you should wear boxer shorts.
- All the time?
- All the time.
You have to get off Jockeys right away.
But I've always worn Jockeys.
Hi, Paul, it's Elaine calling.
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone, so I don't really have time to talk.
Is Noreen there?
Oh, she's not?
Okay, great.
Well, you can just tell her I called then, and...
Well, yes, it has been unseasonably cool lately.
Okay.
Well, look, I'm pulling up to the building now, so I'm gonna...
Yeah, I tip 20 percent too.
Lookit, Paul, the car seems to be running out of gas so I'm gonna have to get off the phone.
Please let me know when your party has arrived.
Yes, I will.
- You mind?
- No, go ahead.
I secondhand smoke two packs a day.
Jerry.
- Excuse me?
- Hi, sorry I'm late.
- Who are you?
- I'm Donna Chang.
What do you mean?
I mean I'm Donna Chang.
You're Donna Chang?
Did you think I was Chinese?
No.
What, you mean because of the "Chang"?
Actually, the family name wasn't originally Chang.
- I didn't think so.
- Used to be "Changstein."
- She's not Chinese?
- No, not Chinese.
Not even Asian.
- So, what is she?
- Well, she's like you.
Oh, how disappointed you must have been.
Well, it's false advertising, see?
And the thing is, I think she likes people thinking she's Chinese.
She suggests Chinese food she always introduces herself as Donna Chang.
So why are you seeing her again?
Well, she is a woman.
Listen, I spoke to Paul and Noreen.
They might be breaking up.
- Really?
- Well, maybe.
Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul and Noreen broke up because you kept hanging up on him?
- What do you mean?
- lf Paul thought it was some guy hanging up because he was having an affair with Noreen.
Here, take my Jockey shorts.
Hey, what is that?
Look, you gotta help me.
I have to get off Jockey shorts.
- What, you have low sperm count?
- Very low.
- Come on, take them.
- I don't want them.
Jerry, look, you gotta help.
If I have one pair in my house, I'll wear them.
- I don't want them.
- All it takes is one pair.
I'm not gonna be able to sleep if those are in the house.
Boxers!
How do you wear these things?
Look at that.
They're bagging up.
They're rising here.
And there's nothing holding me in place.
I'm flipping, I'm flopping.
What am I gonna do?
Jerry, I'm going crazy in these things.
Well, I'm gonna have to move now.
You know what I like about Manhattan?
There's no mosquitoes.
There's plenty of mosquitoes.
Queens is full of mosquitoes.
- So, Dad...
- Gnats, too, if I'm not mistaken.
Heard you were in the city the other day.
Your mother has to tell you every move I make?
I'll kill her.
- Jerry and Elaine saw you.
- They didn't say hello?
- They were in a rush.
- They couldn't just say hello?
Ah, the hell with them.
They said you were with some guy who was wearing a cape.
Elaine, I can see not saying hello.
She's very...
What's the word?
Supercilious.
- So, Dad...
- How could Jerry not say hello?
- Did they uncross the lines yet?
- They can't find the problem.
It's really getting ridicurous.
Did you say "ridicurous"?
Ridiculous.
I thought you said ridicurous.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you.
I didn't know you had company.
- Oh, no, no.
- Hi, I'm George.
- Oh, hi.
- I'm Donna Chang.
I just spoke to your mother before.
- You spoke to my mother?
- She was trying to call you, but...
The rines are crossed.
Did you say the "rines" are crossed?
Did I?
George, she's so sweet.
We talked for an hour.
Anyway, I'm really sorry.
Sorry, why sorry?
What do you have to be sorry about?
Well, she told me she and your father are getting divorced.
Boy, divorced.
That's really too bad.
Yeah.
You know, it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced 30 years ago.
He could've been normal.
Oh, my God!
You know what I just realized?
If they get divorced and live in two separate places that's twice as many visits.
I never thought of that.
Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day.
It's like running a double marathon.
Hey, Georgie, did you have any idea that anything was wrong?
Have you ever spent any time with these people?
- You know what this has to do with?
- What?
The man in the cape.
I bet you he is mixed up in this.
I don't trust men in capes.
You can't cast dispersions on someone just because they're wearing a cape.
Superman wore a cape.
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here and let you say something bad about him.
All right, Superman's the exception.
Hey, Elaine, I just heard that Noreen and Paul are breaking up.
I want you to put in a good word for me.
Always had a thing for Noreen.
No, Kramer, you don't understand, this could be my fault.
Well, if she's available, I won't let her slip through my fingers this time.
Well, looks like you've adjusted to the boxers.
Well, I wouldn't go as far as that.
- You went back to the Jockeys?
- Wrong again.
Oh, no.
What?
What?
Don't you see what's going on here?
No boxers, no Jockeys.
The only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine.
- Kramer, say it isn't so.
- Oh, it be so.
I'm out there, Jerry, and I'm loving every minute of it!
Don't you need a little help?
Surprisingly, no.
I'm free.
I'm unfettered.
I feel like a naked, innocent boy roaming the countryside.
So you guys are trying to work it out.
That's great.
Yeah, well, we're trying, but he just went insane there for a while.
He went insane?
Believe it or not Paul was convinced I was having an affair because somebody kept calling and hanging up whenever he answered.
What kind of a sick person calls and hangs up over and over?
Well I don't know about sick.
I mean, maybe it was somebody who didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat and was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling didn't wanna speak to them.
I can't believe that was you.
I'm really sorry, Noreen.
So you thought he was boring?
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me.
What are you doing to this woman?
This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks.
- I know.
- First you ruin her relationship with the high-talker.
- Well, I got confused.
They sound exactly the same.
So she breaks up with him.
Somehow picks up the pieces of her life miraculously meets a new guy.
You bust that up.
And then just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world he's boring.
I didn't know she'd take it so seriously.
Apparently, you have a tremendous influence over this woman.
Anything you say, she does.
- Yeah?
- It's Donna Chang.
- Come on up.
- I guess I just didn't realize it.
Well, let's look back at your history with this woman.
- Okay?
- Okay.
First, you encouraged her to join the army.
She did.
She was lost.
Then you suggest she goes AWOL.
She did.
Well, she didn't seem to be having so much fun.
Make sure you never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.
If I have this much influence, I'll call her and tell her to get back together with him.
- Hey.
- Oh, Miss Changstein.
- This is Elaine.
- Hi.
How are you?
Guess what?
Mrs. Costanza called me.
- They're not getting divorced.
- Why, what happened?
She was trying to call George last night, she got me we spoke for an hour, and she changed her mind.
- Wow, that's amazing.
- Anyway, she wants to meet me.
She invited me over for dinner.
Said you should come too.
- Tonight?
- Yeah.
I just remembered.
I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture class.
All right, let me just say one thing.
There is no way that this is gonna happen.
No way!
Because if you think I'm going to two Thanksgivings you're out of your mind!
- We're not getting divorced.
- Your mother changed her mind.
You did?
That's good.
That's very good.
- I'm very glad to hear that.
- Yeah, we worked it out.
All right, so let me ask you a question.
Who was the man in the cape?
- He was my lawyer.
- Your lawyer wears a cape?
Yeah.
So what?
- Who wears a cape?
- He's very independent.
He doesn't follow the trends.
He looks ridiculous in that thing.
You have no eye for fashion!
- I have no eye for fashion?
- All right.
Come on.
Let's not fight.
- All right, all right.
- All right.
Georgie's right.
So, what made you change your mind?
It was that Chinese woman.
What did you tell Mrs. Costanza that changed her mind?
Mentioned a few bits of wisdom from Confucius.
- Confucius, huh?
- Yeah.
You know, you're not Chinese.
Hey, I heard the good news.
Jerry, how come you didn't say hello to me the other day?
- Elaine was in a rush.
- I knew it was Elaine.
- You must be Estelle.
- Yes.
Who are you?
I'm Donna Chang.
You're not Chinese.
Hello?
- Paul?
- Elaine.
Kramer?
Yeah!
- What are you doing there?
- Well, isn't it obvious?
- Is Noreen there?
- Yes, she is.
Well, can I talk to her?
What, am I too boring for you?
Would you just put her on?
I feel it would be best that you didn't talk to Noreen for a while.
- You feel?
- That's right.
She and I have had a very long talk.
And I was appalled to learn of the destructive influence you've had over her life lo these many years.
- What, are you insane?
- From now on, I'll be calling the shots.
And what are you gonna tell her?
Well, I've encouraged her to go back into the army.
There she'll get the structure and discipline she needs right now.
And she'll have qualified officers telling her what to do.
Kramer, you have got to let me talk to her.
Can't help you, kid.
- You're not Chinese?
- No.
- I thought you were Chinese.
- I'm from Long Island.
Long Island?
I thought I was getting advice from a Chinese woman.
- I'm sorry.
- Well, then that changes everything.
- What?
She's not Chinese.
I was duped!
So what?
She still gave you advice.
What's the difference?
I'm not taking advice from some girl from Long Island.
Now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?
You want a divorce?
You got one!
You know, you might wanna think about changing your name.
Ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me.
Well, Noreen listened to you like George's mother listened to the Chinese.
Everybody listens to the Chinese.
Look at the fortune cookie.
You couldn't get away with that at other restaurants.
Yeah, no one's reading any rolled up messages in a knish.
Well, it had to happen.
I knew it.
I predicted it.
Saw both of them today.
What a disaster.
I'm running all over Queens.
First, I saw my mother.
We had lunch together.
I never had lunch with my mother before.
It's like a date.
Then we drive down to Kew Gardens, tons of traffic, I see my father.
We played Clue.
All day with this!
Hey, Jerry!
Guess what?
The Kramer name might live on!
Noreen's late!
She's late!
- Who are you?
- I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer.
All right!
Let's do it!
- Hey, what's going on, man?
- I got that stuff, man.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Hey, you guys.
Hey, Buford.
Hey, Milady.
Come on.
Come on.
I've got breakfast for you.
Come over here.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Agnes!
Agnes, come on.
Hey, Buford.
Buford, look, look.
Look what I've got you for breakfast.
Help!
Help me!
Get over here.
Nothing personal, buddy.
You've got to be sick of those tired, two-month relationships.
Problem is, you're not meeting the right kind of woman.
A woman who'll run with the wolves, somebody who'll at least keep you interested.
- Run with the wolves?
- Yeah.
Man, I've told you about watching too much of that Oprah shit.
Come on, Pete.
A little excitement is not gonna kill you.
Terry, I like the women nice, quiet and dull.
You know what I'm saying?
Not like that Mongolian feminist that you set me up with.
Okay, wait a minute.
All right, who is it?
- Who is who?
- Who is she?
- What?
- Come on, come on, you know.
Every time we start talking about my sex life, it comes down to your wife trying to set me up with somebody.
- So, who is she?
- Hold on, hold on, hold on...
- This is your brother talking, G.
- Who is she, man?
What?
She, like, cook breakfast with her toes or something?
- What?
I got to wheel her around or...
- All right, all right, all right.
- Her name is Shanandra.
- Gesundheit.
No, no, come on, dude.
Her name is Shanandra, G.
What the hell is a Shanandra?
I don't know, but she's bad, I'll tell you that.
I am too old to be dating a Shanandra.
Something like...
Something that comes out your nose or something.
Trust me on this one, G.
Keep it up.
Got a job to do here.
Hey, Terry and Pete Nessip, United States Marshals.
May I have your ID, please?
Okay, sir.
Sign right here, please.
Shanandra, sounds like a nightclub.
Gordon Maples, United States Attorney's Office.
- Pete Nessip.
This is my brother Terry.
- Pete, Terry.
Remember when the DEA started electronically confiscating drug money
- from all the banks?
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Dealers started to wake up in the morning to find all their money gone.
So, this guy Leedy was the big computer wonk for the Chang Triad.
He figured out how to hide their money so we couldn't find it.
You mean that guy in there, coughing up furballs, is a genius?
He breaks codes that can't be broken.
It's like he lived inside the computers.
- How did he get caught?
- His ego.
He felt unappreciated, so I cut him a deal to testify and kept him out of sight for the last year and a half.
Now, two weeks from trial, they found him.
I need you guys to move Mr. Leedy up to the pen in Atlanta so I can keep him alive long enough to testify.
What about the cats?
We don't have to take the cats, too, do we?
welcome to Pac-Atlantic flight 611 to Atlanta with continuing service to Seattle.
Please make sure that all carry-on baggage is securely stowed...
Whoops!
It's okay.
That's what I'm here for, cat protection.
Cat protection.
Smooth, real smooth.
Okay, tight enough.
Are you sure you've fed the cats enough?
Agnes, she's got a little bit of a problem with low blood sugar.
Leedy, the cats will be better fed than we will on this plane.
You're not just saying that to make me feel better, are you?
- Now, why would I do that?
- What about the...
How can we make sure they can maintain the temperature in the baggage compartment?
What if they freeze?
I gotta get down and see the cats.
I want...
- Chill, man.
- What if they freeze?
Hey, excuse me.
- Would you like an aisle seat?
- That would be great.
Why are we not in first class?
We should be in first class.
The pleasure's all mine.
43 A and B. This is going to be great.
I'm warning you.
If anything happens to those cats, I'm gonna sue you.
You owe me, G.
You've ever heard of punitive damages, Mr. US Marshal?
We should be in first class, anyway.
- Miss, excuse me.
- Yes, sir.
I'm afraid to fly.
I need some water to take a sedative.
- Okay, no problem.
I'll be right with you.
- Doctor...
Okay, thanks.
we're getting some heavy weather, folks.
So I've got permission to climb to 38,000, see if we can get above it.
Bob, I think you'd better listen to this.
Pac-Air 611 Bravo, this is Miami Approach.
we just received a code-red transmission.
Would you care for some wine?
Thanks, but I only drink wine by candlelight.
Well, I might be able to help you with that.
Would you like to follow me?
Give me a break.
The captain needs to see you on the flight deck, right away.
Yeah.
- Gentlemen
- We just received this.
Flight 611, you are about to be taken over by Posse Comitus.
- Stay on your flight plan.
- Oh, brother.
No one will be hurt.
You'll receive further instructions in five minutes.
Over.
Hands up!
Okay!
Turn around, keep your head down.
I said keep your heads down!
Sit down.
Nobody move, God damn it.
If you do, I'll blow this plane to hell.
You understand?
Get off the phone.
You, too, God damn it.
Get down!
Get your heads down.
Feet on the floor.
Hands out of pockets.
You're not listening.
Both of you!
- Leedy, come with me.
- No, no, no!
No, don't do this.
No, please!
Please don't.
- How much time?
- Ten seconds.
Wait for now.
No, leave my hand.
No, that's my finger!
Jesus!
Be good now.
Be good boys and girls.
If you're not, I'll blow the plane up.
- what happened?
- Number 1 is down!
Talk to me!
Talk to me, Number 1.
I'm bulletproof. what are you?
Hey!
Help!
Now!
- What the hell?
- Shit!
We're losing cabin pressure.
Mayday!
Mayday!
This is Flight 611.
611 Heavy.
Declaring an emergency.
- We have emergency decompression.
...two and four.
We're over Ocala, in Florida.
We're...
Go!
Go!
I've got you.
Hang on.
Okay, hold on to me.
Hold on.
Okay.
Okay, hold on.
I've got you.
Grab her.
Hold her.
- Lena, hold on.
Hold on!
I've got her.
- Okay.
Okay.
Terry, hang on.
Hold on!
Help me!
Hang on, Terry.
- Help!
- Hold on.
I've got you.
Hold on.
Terry, you've gotta hold on!
I'm slipping!
- Terry!
- I won't let go of you!
- Hang on to me!
- No!
Don't...
Terry!
No!
No, Terry!
No.
- Glenn Blackstone, agent in charge, FBI.
- Bob Covington.
Tom McCracken, US Marshal's Office.
Listen, I'm looking for my guy, Pete Nessip.
- Supposed to...
- Pete's over there.
Pete.
Pete, did you see anything?
Two, three, maybe more.
You didn't hear anything?
Their names or anything?
The little girl, I reached for her and I grabbed her.
And...
They shot Terry.
Motherfuckers.
He was bad.
He was real bad.
The blood was everywhere and I...
He was falling.
I grabbed him and I had him.
- I couldn't hold him.
- Oh, my God.
I couldn't hold him.
Bring up the passenger list and seating assignment.
Okay, break down the ticket purchase into cash and credit card.
Cross-check that with advance purchase and same-day purchase.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- It's some kind of virus or worm, sir.
- Well, get it back.
I'm trying, but the whole system's going down.
- It's Leedy...
- What?
- It was a setup.
- A what?
- A setup.
- What are you saying, Nessip?
- A prison break at 30,000 feet?
- Yeah, why not?
So, what did they do?
Come down and pick him up in a goddamn spaceship?
Look, I tackled one of the guys.
He had some sort of pack on his back.
- Maybe it was a parachute.
- What about Leedy, now?
He jumps out, opens up an umbrella and floats down like Mary Poppins?
- Nobody saw a parachute.
- Nobody could see anything.
Their heads were down and the plane was filled with smoke.
What 32 people did see was they saw your brother fire at a man wrapped in explosives.
That's a lie!
Wait a minute, what is this?
The FBI get brownie points for speed?
We're talking about my brother here, man.
Look, isn't that worth the investigation?
- You want an investigation?
- Yes!
Two hours after the explosion, an airline maintenance man was gunned down at Miami airport running away from MPD detention.
And in his apartment they found Posse Comitus literature and homemade C-4 explosives.
The maintenance man put the explosives on board?
That's right.
Detective Fox, Miami PD, recognized the man from the pre-flight inspection.
I'm telling you...
Look, we all feel bad about what happened to your brother, and don't nobody want to paint him the fall guy.
But the fact of the matter is your brother opened fire on that plane and panicked, and 14 people are dead.
My brother didn't panic.
Sir, Forensics just got a positive ID on one of the remains found on the plane.
Your prisoner, Leedy.
Damn!
Through the coordinated investigation of federal, state and local law enforcement officials, the FBI believes that it has answered most of the questions concerning the attempted hijack of Pac-Atlantic Air Flight 611.
It was the Marshal on board who set off the explosion.
Is that true?
That question has been raised and is under investigation...
Hey, guys!
Guys, check it out!
- They're buying it top to bottom.
- Of course they're buying it.
Baby doll, you talk about a rush, man.
We went out that fucking door, that wind hit you like a goddamn freight train.
I'm dragging away from the jet,
I come face to face with this woman, and I swear, she was still holding a magazine.
Has Leedy finished throwing up?
- Yes.
- Good.
No, no, no, don't touch my hand, lady!
Don't!
No!
Don't touch my hand!
- Watch out!
Don't touch my hand!
- Earl, come here!
Don't touch my hand!
Shut up and say thank you.
- Thank you?
- Yes!
You threw me out of an airplane and you bit off my finger.
- You have nine good ones.
- Well, how am I supposed to do my work?
You crashed the entire airline computer system with one hand, didn't you?
The information we have is sketchy right now, but what we're hearing is that the Marshal allegedly fired at a hijacker, and according to passengers, set off the explosion which killed 14 people, including the hijackers.
Yes!
Unload the boat.
Unload the boat.
...and a federal prisoner by the name of Earl Leedy.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, they think I'm dead.
Does that mean I'm free?
You're not free.
Your ass belongs to me.
And I'm gonna make it worth your while.
But wait, he mentioned only two Marshals.
What about the other Marshal that was on the plane?
He's dead.
He's dead.
I shot him.
I don't think so.
He was in the bathroom.
Listen to me!
All he saw was smoke.
We got out clean, except for that bitch that grabbed you, Jagger.
Next time, you just get her and throw her out the door.
I'll buy you breakfast.
Come on, let's go.
Breakfast.
- What you got, Deuce?
- I got homemade grits and eggs.
How are you doing, Pete?
I need to talk to you.
It's important.
So is this.
Wait till you see what I found.
I got it nailed down to a two-square-mile radius where the hijackers could've landed.
We've got our bodies, Pete.
Yeah, but the only bodies we've got that are burned beyond recognition are those of the terrorists and that prick Leedy.
Does that make any sense?
Pete, nobody jumps from a 747 at that altitude and speed and lives.
- Period.
You understand that?
- No, no, no, that's where you're wrong.
Look, a SEAL team did it.
Jumped out of a 727 three years ago.
I'm telling you, it's a setup.
Now all I have to do is figure out how Leedy fits into all this.
What?
The Board of Review is looking at this in two weeks...
The Board of Review!
...to determine yours and Terry's responsibility for the accident.
- What responsibility?
- Pete, listen to me.
The FAA and the airline's in the middle of a goddamn firestorm with the media, the insurance companies, relatives of dead passengers...
Nobody wants to hear about skydiving.
Skydiving from 747s!
They're looking to point fingers at somebody, and you and Terry are it.
Don't you understand that?
You know the SOP on this.
I have to ask you for your badge and your gun.
- What?
You're suspending me?
- Pete, please, you know the rules.
Give me your badge and your gun, please.
I don't care.
I'm not quitting on this.
I took a team out in a commercial jet.
Delta Squad deployment, hostage-drill scenario.
- So it can be done?
- We did it.
But it was a 727 at 20,000 feet.
And it was a drill, no explosions.
A 747 at 38,000 feet, I doubt it.
Plus, you got another problem.
- Petty Officer.
- Yes, sir.
You see this?
You see this D-ring?
High-density metal.
Now, your terrorists may have had somebody stash a few guns behind a seat, but not five parachute rigs.
Five rigs going through X-ray and metal detectors would raise holy hell with airport security.
- Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.
So, with the right equipment, it is possible.
Mister, to even think about jumping from a 747 you've either got to be very skilled or dick-brained.
- Now, which one do you wanna talk to?
- What do you mean?
Well, skilled is a guy named Don Jagger.
World-champion skydiver.
Dick-brained is his old partner, Jess Crossman.
Where can I find them?
I don't think they jump together anymore, but Crossman lives real close to here.
- Jess Crossman?
- Not today, man.
- Do you know where I can find him?
- You must be with the class.
Check upstairs.
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem, dude.
Be right out.
Damn!
- What was that?
- Can you believe that?
Now you listen here to me.
I hope you're good at fixing toilets, because you're never, ever gonna fix another plane of mine.
I got my new chute in.
You want to take me up later?
I'll take your face off if you don't come and fix this plane right.
Where did you learn how to fix planes?
Mr. Goodwrench?
This isn't a waiting room, and the next load is booked.
Damn.
And I really wanted to get on that plane.
DEA, FBI or local?
Jess Crossman.
If you want to talk to me, you're either a skydiver or a cop.
And, well, you definitely don't look like any skydiver I have ever seen.
You know, cops, I don't like them.
Every time you've met one has been right after you've broken the law.
Yeah.
Did I go out of state without calling my parole officer?
Yes, I admit it.
But it was an emergency.
You're not here about a parole violation?
Have you heard about a hijacking of a 747?
Yeah.
Hear about it, how could I miss it?
What a major screwup!
What if it wasn't a screwup?
What if someone just wanted to make it look that way?
- Why?
- To grab a prisoner I was escorting.
A jump.
A jailbreak from a 747?
That's a cool idea.
No offense.
- Could you do it?
- What, am I a suspect?
Why do you ask?
Well, because people probably told you that Jessie Crossman was the only person skilled enough to jump from a 747.
Well, the actual phrase used was "dick-brained."
And I checked.
You were with your parole officer.
Look, some yahoo pulled a John Wayne on that flight and got a lot of people killed, all right?
That's not what happened, Ms. Crossman.
And that yahoo was my brother.
Well, God.
I'm sorry about that.
But if I'm not a suspect, then I don't have to talk to you, do I?
You still haven't answered the question about the jump.
See, the longer I stand here, the broker I get.
So...
You want to talk to me about jumping, you can pay like everyone else, right, Mr. Cop?
We'll see.
What do I need this getup for if I don't have a chute?
It's my drop zone, it's my rules.
Wait a minute, now.
You're not scared, are you?
No.
Hey, wait!
Hold on!
Wait for me!
All right, give me a controlled exit and a good arch.
Ready, set, go!
I don't get the attraction.
You know, haven't you ever watched a bird gliding on the wind
- and wished you could do it?
- Yeah, for about 20 seconds.
You know, you just don't get it, do you?
What could be so difficult about jumping out of an airplane?
You count to 20, you pull the damn string and that's it.
Let the air sculpt your body position, all right?
Ready, set, go!
- Yes!
- Jesus...
Can you see the way the wind forces the...
Come here.
Can you see the way the wind forces their bodies open?
We're only at 80 knots.
A 747 at 500 knots would rip a jumper clean apart.
And that, my friend, is where the skill comes in.
No big deal.
You are way out of your league up here, cowboy.
Way out.
I hear you talking all this stuff about skill.
If you're so good, how come you're still working in this shithole?
What?
What, you need to be hooked on phonics?
Shit hole.
Shithole.
Hey!
He paid for one jump, I might as well give him one.
For Christ's sake, just go get him, okay?
All right.
Help!
Get off of me!
Get off of me.
You kicked me.
Wait!
Come back!
Come back!
Come back!
- Help me!
- I've got you.
You're crazy!
- Hold still.
- Get me out of this.
I thought you did okay.
Welcome to the sky!
You fell, you lived, good start.
Now you fell, you lived, I'm gone.
You're out of your damn mind.
There are things in here.
Hey!
Hey, I didn't know she was going to do that, okay?
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah?
I bet it was a whole lot safer than landing with you in that damn plane of yours.
Where can I find Don Jagger?
There's a big jump this weekend at Ocean Reef.
All the hot ones will be there.
That's your best bet, man.
Thank you.
Skydivers are a real tight group.
You're gonna have a tough time breaking in by yourself.
Well, I'll take my chances, thank you very much.
Hey, you know, Jess didn't mean anything by that.
Ever since Jagger went south on her she's been a little touchy.
What happened to Jagger?
He says he got conned into making some drug jumps.
He did a little time.
She did a little time, too.
- They never patched things up.
- Why would she want to?
She's loyal.
I'd give her that much.
What do you think?
I think it's time for you to zip it.
And let's go on and get that rammerjammy fixed on the tail, all right?
- Nice jump, man.
- Yeah, right!
Shit!
I'll kill you.
Please, don't push me.
Don't let me...
Wait.
No, wait.
No!
- Nice landing.
- Good.
Good.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come on, come on, come on...
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- I can't.
I can't.
- Hit it, brother.
Hit it, brother.
Hit it.
- I can't, I'm sorry...
- Leedy, do your job.
I need a minute to steady myself.
When we break in, we don't have minutes, we have seconds.
- It's the jump.
Don't...
It's the jump.
- Now, do it.
- I can't think.
- Jump him until he can.
Maybe he's had enough for one day, all right?
I haven't had enough for one day.
Jump him till he can, come on.
- Please.
I can't think.
- Come on.
Up and at 'em.
- Go!
Come on!
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Up and at 'em.
Come on, let's go.
- I don't want to jump anymore!
- Come on, go!
This is going to be a snap.
God, this is easy.
They're not going to know what hit them.
- Hi, Joy Willins.
- I'm Pete.
- Pete.
Yeah.
- It's a pleasure.
Miami Police.
They've been really great.
Come on, Lena's around back.
Look what I've got for you.
Thank you.
That's to replace the one that you lost on the plane.
Maybe it'll make you feel a little better.
Lena, do you remember me?
Remember that your tiger bumped me upside the head when we were on the plane?
Do you remember anything about your plane trip?
Maybe that there was something strange happening, there was noise, yelling?
No, I fell asleep and when I woke up we were already landed.
I'm going to show you some pictures and I want you to look at them very carefully.
This is the plane that we were on.
Remember?
Remember the plane?
And then something went wrong.
Something happened.
There was a loud noise.
There was a lot of smoke.
- A big noise?
- A big noise.
There was a lot of wind and people were yelling and screaming.
Do you remember if you saw anyone?
Help me!
- What are you doing?
- Do you remember anything about what he may have been wearing or...
What?
He wore glasses?
He...
The scar.
He had a scar?
Lena, was this the man that you saw on the plane?
You can tell me, nobody's gonna hurt you.
Look, see, he has a scar.
Is this the man?
All right, okay.
Look, look.
That's enough, okay?
- That's enough.
Could you please go now?
- See, he has a scar.
- Was this the man you saw?
- Let's end it.
I'm gonna get the detectives.
- You can answer, it's okay.
- Detective Wallace!
- That's all right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Please.
- Thank you, Lena.
I'm sorry.
- Come on, it's all right.
That's all right.
Yes!
Detective Fox, Miami Metro.
Concerning that plane accident you're investigating.
The other US Marshal on the plane has acquired some information.
- The other Marshal?
- That's correct.
The young lady on the plane, she gave him a partial ID of one of the hijackers.
A scar under his right eye.
- I'm impressed.
- Thank you.
Not with you, with the other Marshal.
Hang on, I wanna come with you.
- Hey, Don.
- Hey.
You're mine now.
Where I go, you go.
Let me go or lose me forever.
I'm serious.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Hey.
Ty, what are you doing?
Hey, hey, let me go.
What are you doing?
Let me go!
Hey!
Hey!
Damn it!
Hey, God damn it!
Let me go!
Let me go!
You son of a bitch!
It's all over.
Bye-bye.
No!
Cool move, papa.
You see that?
9-1-1 is not gonna work for him.
What you just saw there can happen to any one of you.
Our skydiving team is now four strong.
No problems with that.
Oh, God.
Did you ever jump those round chutes?
You can't steer the damn things and you never know where they're gonna come down.
I got enough branches up my ass to start a pulpwood mill.
Hi.
I'd like...
I don't know, maybe...
A minute to wait for you to come back.
- Look at this guy.
- What's he doing at our table?
I don't think he gets it.
Let's explain it to him.
Yeah.
Here it goes.
This is going to get messy.
Hey, guys, I'm sitting in your seats?
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Can I offer you a beer?
- Sure.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Hey, hey, come on, man.
If you wanted me to move, you just should have asked.
Jesus!
Take it.
Get these guys a beer.
Get him a pillow.
- Nessip.
- Bob.
Nice to meet you, Bob.
See you up there.
Well, I see you've met some skydivers.
You're not much of a cop, but you sure do make friends easy.
If you blow my cover, I'm gonna bust your ass right back to prison.
Do you understand me?
Looks like you're doing a good job of blowing your own cover.
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Last time I did that, I got into a fight.
Look, buddy, at the moment we're the only cover you've got.
Have a seat.
Look, all I want to do is talk to your friend Jagger.
Okay, then here's what I want.
There's a big exhibition jump in DC next weekend.
I want to go, but my parole officer won't let me.
- Keep talking.
- Well, see, you got a big problem here.
The only way you're gonna learn anything is if you hang out with the best.
And right now, you're kind of sticking out like a Cub Scout in a whorehouse.
Bad news, man, you're not gonna believe what happened.
I reach your parole officer and you work me in with these guys, right?
And another thing...
Burn in.
Drinks up!
Blue skies!
- Black death!
- Black death!
What the hell is that?
It means some skydiver somewhere burned in today.
- What does that mean?
- As in, crash landed.
Dead.
They're gonna ring that bell and raise a toast every hour till midnight.
- Great tradition.
- Who hammered in?
Jagger.
Damn!
The cops found him with a fat sack of cocaine on him.
He was stuck up in some power lines.
Power lines?
What, he just floated into the power lines, Sel?
It's just what I heard.
I'm sorry.
- No, that's not possible.
- Jessie, I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
If you want my help, you pay for me and the airplane.
- Okay, how much?
- $15,000.
- $15,000?
- That's what it costs.
What do you care, anyway?
It's the government's money.
I don't work for the government anymore.
I'll talk to you later.
What's up, man?
- Good news.
Good news, Mr. Moncrief.
- What's that?
Our client has found your offer quite interesting.
We're all just a little concerned about the fact that you used to be an agent for the DEA.
Used to be.
Used to be is why I'm worth something to you.
Right, right, well your past leaves a bad taste in our client's mouth.
You have to do better than that.
If the taste was bad, gentlemen, you wouldn't be here.
What I'm offering you, no one else in the world can provide.
No one else.
I'm willing to prove it by doing it one time for free.
Then when we meet again, you tell your boss to bring his wallet.
Payment in full.
Simple as that.
Then we have a deal.
Thanks for lunch.
Let's go.
Go!
You're up.
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready!
Torski, these are computers.
- Silent movies for 400, please.
- Answer there...
Who is Jackie Cooper?
Coogan.
Jackie Coogan, stupid...
- We gotta go.
- Damn it.
Give me some space!
Hey, how are you doing?
I've got a surprise for you here.
My God.
Look at this.
Too bad we're not in the drug business.
- Come on, Leedy.
- I've almost got it.
- There.
- Where are you...
Can I help with anything?
You're making me nervous.
Would you just get away?
You got two minutes, Earl.
- What can I do to help you?
- I've got access.
Good.
Good.
- I'm into the system.
- Yes.
- Wanna run this up to the evidence locker?
- You got it, babe.
Hey, Judy, Judy, wait up.
Baby, don't come down here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey.
- The elevator's coming up.
- Roger that.
- Earl, we have to close that now.
- Okay!
Okay!
All right, okay.
Here they come.
Look at him.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
- We've got to go.
Close it down.
- Don't rush me.
They'll know we were here.
You did good.
Move it.
Stay.
Go!
Go!
- we're moving, Torski.
- Got you.
Oh, yeah.
God damn it!
Fucking Leedy threw up all over me.
The daring late-night theft netted criminals over $50,000 worth of drugs stolen from this protective enclosure.
The thieves hid out in the building's maintenance area until everyone had gone home.
An intensive Internal Affairs review is underway, since access to these areas is strictly limited to station personnel.
Reporting from Miami headquarters, I'm Diana Morales.
Back to you.
I have to admit it, you're good, but so am I.
Here come your Miami undercover agents.
Finally.
These narcs are walking around somewhere thinking they're alive.
Excellent.
Thank you, carry on.
So, is that it?
- Am I done?
- No, a little while longer.
Is this the Marshal, the other Marshal?
The one on the plane?
- You told me you took care of him.
- Don't worry about him.
What do you mean, don't worry about it?
The guy you killed is his brother.
Leedy!
I said don't worry about him.
I'll take care of my end of it, okay?
- Radical.
- All right, man, right behind you.
Yeah, I'm ready, man.
- Where's your car?
- Don't ask.
- Well, very, very cool bike.
- Air time.
Where's my team?
All right, all right, they're upstairs.
- All right.
- Come on.
Looking good, guys.
Good formation.
That's great.
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, Jess.
- How you doing?
- How you doing, baby?
I'm getting together a team for the DC jump.
What about it?
- Hell, yes.
Are you kidding me?
- Cool.
Have you seen Swoop around?
No, not for a while.
I heard that crazy bastard was living on the street, though.
Yeah, right.
What else is new?
I think I know where he's at.
We'll find him and Hockridge and we've got ourselves a team.
- I'm in.
Good to see you.
- All right.
Good to see you.
Jess, come here.
Hockridge is out, he busted his ankle.
- What?
- It wasn't even on a jump.
He slipped getting out of the bathtub.
But, you see, I figure I could take his place, no problem.
What have you logged, sweet pea, a whole 20 jumps?
Come on, Jess, when was the last time you actually saw me jump?
No, he is looking a lot better, Jess.
I've been giving him some extra air time.
- He's good.
- You give me half the chance,
- I'll slice the sky to pieces.
- Look, Selly, I don't need an Indiana Jones.
I need somebody who's good and who takes orders, period.
Well, I like the kid's attitude.
He's got a lot of enthusiasm.
I think he does, too, but enthusiasm can get you killed up there.
Thank you, Pete.
- I can get Burt, he'll be here next week.
- No, I can't deal with Burt.
Can I have your attention, please?
All right, Selly, you're in.
But here's the drill.
First of all, you're our mechanic, so please keep the plane flying.
Second of all, if you hotdog on me, you're gone.
And third, Winona, keep a watch on the extra air time.
Come on, let's go.
I'm taking Pete, we're gonna go find Swoop.
- Swoop?
He's a nutcase.
- Swoop is cool.
Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop you.
- I'm jumping, right?
- Jumping out of a plane?
No, I need you alive to deal with my probation officer.
- Come on, Jess, I'm serious.
- So am I. I'm a good teacher, but nobody's good enough to get you up to exhibition level in a week.
Jess, here's the deal.
Something tells me I'm not going to find who I'm looking for down here, right?
So, I gotta go up there.
If I don't jump, we've got no deal.
All right, you're an alternate, you train, but you don't jump the exhibition.
Way to go, kid.
- Swoop.
- Why are we up here, again?
Swoop!
What the hell would he be doing over there?
Swoop!
Over here.
- Hey, Swoop.
- Hey!
- What are you doing?
- Jeez.
How about this, huh?
The fine folks of this building asked if I'd just come out here and do a few windows, this and that.
- I need you for a team, Swoop.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
How much does it pay?
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
All your jumps are paid for.
So, how about those jumps, there, Jess, are they paid for?
- Yeah, they are.
- Didn't I just say that to him?
Yeah, but if he hasn't jumped with you, he won't talk to you.
He won't.
Well, I am going to have to require a free T-shirt, Jess.
- What?
Can we get him a free T-shirt?
- Yes.
Tell him he can have a T-shirt.
- Okay.
Free T, Swoop.
Whatever you want.
- Yeah!
- Swoop.
Yeah.
- My lucky day.
Here, give me a hand.
All right!
It opened.
That ain't funny.
That ain't funny, man.
Did you know about this?
Find what you're looking for?
- How long have you been following me?
- Ever since you decided to be my friend.
What's this all about?
When a skydiver burns in, the cops bring the rig to a safety officer for inspection.
- And this is Jagger's.
- And...
What?
There's nothing wrong with this rig.
Which means he would have had to screw up big time in order to float into those power lines.
And there's no way that happened.
He had help.
- Aren't these supposed to be metal?
- Yeah, it's a smuggler's rig.
- A what?
- It's a smuggler's rig.
Drug runners custom-make them out of high-density fabric to escape radar.
- There's no metal in them.
- Would these pass through airport security?
- Yeah, probably.
- Damn!
What?
Pete!
Put this back right where you found it, all right?
You listen to me, these people are killers.
You leave the cop stuff to me.
All right.
- Milton.
- Mike. wake up, Mike.
This is Nessip.
Pete.
What?
I got an envelope that I'm delivering to you with a piece of nylon in it.
I want you to examine it for explosives, all right?
Explosives?
Nylons?
Are you dating that Mongolian feminist again?
Look, I need your help on this, Mike.
I thought you were on suspension...
Vacation.
Suspension.
You can say it.
Yeah, I am.
That's why I need you to do this for me.
Just examine it for explosives, alloys, powder, whatever you can find.
Anything.
This is the Justice Department.
We don't have time for that.
Mike, just do it, okay?
All right.
And don't tell them it's for me, or else they'll fire your ass.
Why can't you just be calling to borrow money like usual, Pete?
Hey.
- Let's go.
- Go in.
Come on!
Get in there.
Yeah, watch this.
- He isn't balancing at all.
- Yeah.
See?
Beautiful!
- Watch it coming down.
- I love it.
Oh, yeah!
Crash and burn.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
I love it!
I love it!
What a ride!
What a ride!
Need for speed.
That was great!
That was great!
It was incredible!
How did I do?
Come on, what's with him?
I jumped with him.
What's the deal?
I don't think he counts what you just did as a jump.
He's kind of funny that way.
Well, what kind of other jump is there?
There's only one kind ofjump and I did a sweet one, if I must say.
My buddy, Luxem, ran the lab on your nylon.
This is serious guacamole.
Look at this.
He found C-4 explosive, flash-bang residue, high-grade alloys.
I mean, you ain't dealing with a cat burglar, Pete.
Yeah, but it means I'm in the right place.
Tell your friend I owe him one.
No need, I promised him you'd paint his house this summer.
The chopper's aboard.
Good to see you.
Hey, how you doing?
Good to see you again.
- How are you?
- Good to see you.
- Welcome.
Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.
- Follow me, please.
- We've tested your free sample and decided we want more.
There's only one way you're gonna get more.
Your price is rather large.
So are the results.
Good evening, everyone.
Welcome aboard.
I'm only interested in long-term investments.
What happens when the DEA replaces their dead agents?
And they will.
You're buying a very sophisticated data service.
Once we're in the DEA computer, we're in, and we'll update you whenever they do.
And the charge for this update?
$2 million a month for the operations and names of every undercover DEA agent in the world.
What can I say?
When do we see the list?
The day after Thomas Jefferson died, July 5th.
God bless America.
All right, settle down, everybody, settle down.
And welcome to DC.
Yeah!
The jump tomorrow is one you're gonna tell your grandchildren about.
We're jumping into the city's fireworks display and coming right down in Potomac Park.
That's right.
Everybody settle down.
That's right, a 34-way carousel dive.
Got Jack in the center surrounded by a nine-way star, outside of that, a 24-way star.
The judges today determine who gets to jump tomorrow, and who doesn't.
You wanna be in a big fireworks show, you'd better fly your butts off.
You need 10 points or better to qualify.
That's all I've got to say.
Let's load them up and skydive!
- Four hundred, 450.
Something like that.
- No.
- What kind of competition is that?
- A vicious competition, man.
Ten points I gotta get?
Hey, Swoop, how did you fix in with this group, man?
- It's a little embarrassing, isn't it?
- It's all right.
It's all right.
What are you, a comedian?
Why don't you fuck off?
Nice landing, man!
- You are bad!
- That's my man.
My chute!
- All right.
All right.
Okay.
- All right.
Okay, that's 10 points for Moncrief's team.
- That's 10 points for Crossman's team.
- Both teams qualify.
Hey, Torski, watch your butt!
Hey!
Hey!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Hey, get the hell out of my face, man.
- Hey!
Hey, you, you son of a bitch.
- Merry Christmas, asshole.
- Holy shit.
What's that guy doing?
- It looks like a gift wrap.
Rock and roll!
God damn it!
Get away from me.
Get away from me.
Son of a bitch!
Get away.
No, get the hell away from me!
Bunch of assholes!
High five.
- Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop!
- Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop!
Thank you.
- Who's the guy with Torski?
- Ty Moncrief.
He's military or something.
He shows up now and then for big jumps.
I got to go strangle the weasel.
You do that, Pete.
- That guy was right.
- We'll mess things up.
- Look who's here, Deucie.
- Knock yourself out, man.
- Mr. Comedian.
- We're just jumpers, here.
- What do you think you're doing, sport?
- Can't we all just...
You think it's funny?
You wanna play with me?
You son of a bitch.
How are you doing now, sport?
You wanna do this?
You want to play with me, son?
How do you like that?
Shit!
- Yeah, the toilet's stopped up, man.
- Yeah?
- Why don't you go use a tree?
- A tree?
- Yeah, right there, see?
- Okay.
That's okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm environmentally conscious.
Why don't you try this on for a while?
Hey, man, none of this is any of your business, unless you want me to make it such, so why don't you get out of here?
You fuck with my team, you fuck with me.
Hey, fuck you and fuck your team.
I look out for everyone.
Come on.
Come on.
Swoop.
Swoop.
Watch your head.
Come on.
What?
So, what about this Ty Moncrief?
Jagger did a couple of drug carries for them three years ago.
Thanks.
Is he good enough to be one of the people I'm looking for?
If I find out that he killed Jagger, it won't matter how good he is.
Well, why would he risk showing his face around here?
I mean, what's so special about this DC jump?
Well, the 4th-of-July exhibition, Pete, it's the biggest thing in the world.
I mean, Washington, DC is a drop zone.
Any other day, it's the most restricted air space.
That's why every skydiver worth his ass wants in on this load.
- Where exactly are they putting down?
- Sel, pass me that map.
Please.
Thank you.
It's right there, right by the Washington Monument.
You mean a jumper could put down anyplace he wanted to?
I myself am going to make a landing right in Abe Lincoln's lap.
Jess, you tell the new guy, "Thanks."
Thanks.
Yeah, tell him, "Anytime." I enjoyed it.
- Can I keep this?
- Sure.
All right, see you, guys.
That's him.
That's what I've been trying to tell you all along.
- I know.
I know.
- And I'm telling you, we'd better take this son of a bitch out
- before he shuts us down.
- Shut up.
Shut up.
This is real simple.
Cops can smell dead cops 100 miles away.
We keep their team on the ground, they'll never touch us.
- I see.
So how do you plan on doing that?
- By taking out their leader.
Crossman.
This is Jessie's trailer.
Not much longer, man, we've gotta move.
Have a nice trip.
Patrick, get this off to Chicago and wait for the fax.
It's number six.
Tom.
- Holy shit.
What the hell happened to you?
- I've got to talk to you.
Come on in here.
Patrick, let me know when that comes in.
Working undercover while on suspension violates your sworn oath.
Not to mention 20 different laws.
- Me accessing his file makes it 21.
- I'm in the middle of them.
As a matter of fact, I found one of the chutes from the 747.
- Did you know that?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
If you've got evidence, make your case to the FBI.
You're going to have to do better than this Ty Moncrief fellow.
He's DEA.
See that?
- Moncrief is DEA?
- Honorably discharged eight months ago.
I'll bring his service record up so you can see it.
What the hell's going on with this computer?
Leedy.
Peter.
Pete!
Okay, folks, check it out.
Demo jumpers, we've got about a 12-minute call to dress rehearsal.
Twelve-minute call.
Let's nail this one, puppies.
we've gotta nail this one.
- Guys, has anyone seen Nessip?
- Who?
No.
Pete.
No.
What's your problem, ace?
What's the matter, sweet pea?
Nothing, I mean, I'm not the pro here,
I don't want to be the one to screw things up.
Sel, you're not going to screw anything up.
Listen to me.
This rig, it logged two world titles for Jagger and one for me, all right?
You wanna wear this?
This mean I don't have to wear that stupid helmet?
Sel, no, you don't gotta wear the stupid helmet.
How's that, all right?
- Yeah!
Let's jump!
- The star!
- I'm ready.
- Hold on, hotdog.
- Time to go.
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's get out there.
- Do it!
Shit.
Somebody didn't open.
Selkirk, cut away.
Damn it.
Cut away.
I can't get it.
Cut away.
4,000 feet.
Swoop, get him.
God damn.
- Two grand.
Pull it!
- Pull it!
- Pull it.
- Pull it.
Come on, pull.
Come on.
Paramedics to the water area now!
We need a medic over here.
- God, what happened to him?
- It's not good.
Sel, can you hear us?
Please.
God damn it, get this off him.
- Stay with us, Selly.
- Oh, Bobby, he's not breathing.
- He's not breathing.
- He tried to pull it, it just wouldn't work.
- God.
Get up!
- Here we go.
Get us a medic, God damn it.
Stay with us, Selly.
- I hear it.
I hear it.
- Yeah!
Yeah!
Selkirk, buddy.
- He's breathing.
He's breathing.
- There you go.
- He's breathing.
- Look out, let me in here.
- Look out.
You all right?
- He's breathing.
Okay.
Good job.
Good job.
- You're going to be okay.
- You're gonna be okay, buddy.
- Can you hear me?
- It's okay.
- Sel.
- Take it easy.
- We're right here, buddy.
- Sorry, guys, but you can't stay in here.
We're going to stay right here with you, buddy, all right?
You can meet us at the hospital, but nobody rides in the van.
- Bullshit, we're family.
- Nobody.
Hey, guys, don't worry about it, right?
You guys have gotta jump anyway.
Get the hell out of here.
Just tell Jess her rig's broken.
All right, man, we'll see you at the hospital.
Where the hell is Jessie?
Winona, let's get this plane in the air.
We're going after Ty's plane.
- Who's this?
- I'm a US Marshal.
Now, you can read about it later.
No way, later.
We're going.
Come on.
Crank it up.
- I want to jump!
- Okay, let's go.
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go!
Bye-bye.
Let's go.
Chutes on.
Let's go.
Here we go.
We're so close to pulling this off.
All you have to do...
Hey, surprise!
Only one of you really has to die.
So tell me, who killed Jagger?
How about me?
You wanna try me?
You come here, I'll shoot you right in between the fucking eyes!
Jesus, Jessie, bad idea...
You look like a little boy without a chute, Jessie.
- I knew it was you, Ty.
- Stay there.
You don't know what you're doing.
No.
You don't know what the fuck you're doing.
Let me tell you about Jagger.
He betrayed you.
He left you in prison to rot like jailbait.
This is his girlfriend.
You meant nothing to him.
He's dead.
You're on the wrong...
Sit down.
Get off of me.
- Get off.
- Throw her out.
Throw her out.
Jump.
Jump, Jessie, I dare you.
- Oh, shit.
- Jess.
- She's got a lot ofjuice.
- Yeah, but she ain't got no wings, man.
Let's go, get our chutes on.
We've lost them.
They sure as hell weren't tracking for the fireworks.
I know where Ty's headed.
He's going to the DEA building.
Right near the drop zone.
- Should I radio for backup?
- Yeah, right.
First they'll laugh at you, then they'll throw your ass in jail.
Jesus, Mary, priest!
Jessie.
She's hanging on the footrail.
What the hell is she doing?
I know exactly what she's doing.
It's the only trick I know.
- Swoop, what are you doing?
- I'm not going to miss this.
...reveals nothing.
I suggest his mind has been so conditioned as part of a preconceived plan.
God damn, look at this dweeb.
You think by the 23rd century they'd have better toupees than that.
- They all wear wigs on that show.
- Not Spock.
- He got the ears.
- What the hell are you talking about?
All clear up here.
I'm going to the 19th floor.
Little power hit.
Probably burning down the kitchen again.
Joanne, are you cooking again?
we've had a couple power spikes.
No, you guys want to order a pizza?
I'm starving.
All right, we're in.
- Radio check.
- One.
- Two.
- Three.
Clear.
Not now.
There is no logic in Thelev's attack upon the Captain.
There is no logic...
Okay.
- Is it going to work?
- It's going to work.
Come on, come on, come on.
Go, go, go, go, go.
- Leedy.
Earl.
Earl!
- Leedy, quickly.
Where are you?
Come on.
- We're all clear.
- Good.
Okay, we're into the game.
Come on.
How smart can one man be?
Jimmy Sansome, Jesus Christ, that guy used to hit on me.
This guy's a Fed?
- Deuce, run code blue.
Are you ready?
- Yeah, copy, Ty.
I'm ready to rock and roll.
It's cool up here.
The chutes are ready.
- What the...
- Look out!
What's the matter, you can't fly?
Swoop, get away from the door.
Follow me.
Come on, get him up.
You're dead, dead.
Thank God!
Listen up.
Stage 1 is completed.
Stay focused, we're right on schedule.
Yeah.
Well, the schedule's gonna change.
- Come on.
Are you okay?
- There you go.
- Swoop, stay here.
Don't rob him, okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
Okay, okay.
- I'm going for help.
- Okay, easy, take it easy.
Easy.
She's going for help.
What the hell?
Joanne, come back to me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got you.
Joanne, we've got a circuit trip, says a washer trolley is moving.
Check it out, will you?
Hi, we might be under attack from Klingons.
Maybe they got food.
Okay, I'm on my way.
I'll be back.
Ty, the elevator's moving.
Stop it on this floor.
I'm coming to meet you.
Stay with Leedy.
Hey!
Quiet, quiet, quiet.
Give him the gun, give him the gun.
It's okay, don't panic.
Why don't you radio down and tell them everything's fine, you're okay?
Tell them you're fine.
Nothing going on up here.
We're still getting a washer-trolley signal, though.
- Probably just a short.
- Roger.
Yeah, thank you.
You're dismissed.
You take care of her.
I'm letting them know.
Oh, my God!
- Fuck!
- What?
Whoa!
God damn it!
You go up on the roof.
Kara, check the floor.
I'm coming with Leedy.
I'm with the magician.
You're on the roof.
I need you.
Come on, come on, let's go.
- All right, Leedy, I'm right outside.
- What?
Where are you going?
Hey!
I'm calling for backup.
Call the fire department, too.
We got smoke on the 20th floor.
Right.
Close it out.
Close it out.
Now!
- Ty...
- You little...
God damn it.
Kara.
- Are you proud of yourself?
- Ty, get off me.
Come on.
Come on, go, go.
I'll be right back, okay?
Okay, I'll be right nearby.
- Right nearby, okay?
- All right.
All right.
Jessie?
Jessie, what do you want me to do?
- Leedy, don't you move.
- What?
Wait, wait.
No, wait, wait.
- Don't move.
- You got them.
You got them.
You've got them on hijacking, murder, smuggling, kidnapping, cruelty to animals.
Look what they did to me.
They took my finger...
Thought you'd get away from me, huh?
Earl.
Earl, you disappoint me.
They're going to put you away if you go in.
Who's your friend?
Look, I was just trying to stall them for you.
You're the reason your little brother's dead, you idiot.
Families shouldn't fly together.
That's all right, you'll meet him again.
I guarantee that.
And when you do, he's gonna bust your ass.
You try and stop me, or bring me somewhere, you're fucked!
He's bluffing, Jessie.
He needs this little bastard.
Don't you think about it!
Shoot him, shoot him dead!
Freeze!
Drop your weapons.
I said drop them!
Leedy?
Leedy!
Shit!
Oh, Jesus.
Look, guys, is this really necessary?
I'm not that hurt.
You know, I've been through worse than this before.
I will personally write the President and recommend that you receive commendation for your actions.
Now, if you'll just maintain your stations here, and secure this location,
I'll be checking the rest of the area.
- Jerry.
- Dupont, Ted.
- Yes, very good work.
- With a "J."
Leedy.
Leedy.
Leedy, you come back here.
Leedy.
Leedy.
Stop that guy.
Stop.
The one with the bozo hairdo.
Leedy.
Jesus, listen to me.
Listen to me.
He's wearing a DEA jacket.
Stop...
Leedy, you come...
Leedy!
Leedy!
Stop that guy.
No way.
Don't make me roll after you.
You better not make me roll after you.
Yeah, that guy right there.
He's one of the bad guys.
Fucking awesome, man.
Way to go, Swoop!
Hey, man, it's the other leg, man.
- All right, I'll see you in a bit.
- All right.
Pete!
Hi, Pete, are you all right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Well, you jumped, you lived.
That's a good start.
Yeah.
Maybe in another 40 or 50 years I'll try it again.
Pete!
Pete, Pete, Pete.
- Swoop!
- Hey, Pete, Pete.
- Listen, talk to these guys, okay?
- We want to help you.
Okay?
Tell them that my leg is broke, okay?
Anything you want, Swoop.
Anything you want, brother.
All right!
Let's do it!
- Hey, what's going on, man?
- I got that stuff, man.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Hey, you guys.
Hey, Buford.
Hey, Milady.
Come on.
Come on.
I've got breakfast for you.
Come over here.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Agnes!
Agnes, come on.
Hey, Buford.
Buford, look, look.
Look what I've got you for breakfast.
Help!
Help me!
Get over here.
Nothing personal, buddy.
You've got to be sick of those tired, two-month relationships.
Problem is, you're not meeting the right kind of woman.
A woman who'll run with the wolves, somebody who'll at least keep you interested.
- Run with the wolves?
- Yeah.
Man, I've told you about watching too much of that Oprah shit.
Come on, Pete.
A little excitement is not gonna kill you.
Terry, I like the women nice, quiet and dull.
You know what I'm saying?
Not like that Mongolian feminist that you set me up with.
Okay, wait a minute.
All right, who is it?
- Who is who?
- Who is she?
- What?
- Come on, come on, you know.
Every time we start talking about my sex life, it comes down to your wife trying to set me up with somebody.
- So, who is she?
- Hold on, hold on, hold on...
- This is your brother talking, G.
- Who is she, man?
What?
She, like, cook breakfast with her toes or something?
- What?
I got to wheel her around or...
- All right, all right, all right.
- Her name is Shanandra.
- Gesundheit.
No, no, come on, dude.
Her name is Shanandra, G.
What the hell is a Shanandra?
I don't know, but she's bad, I'll tell you that.
I am too old to be dating a Shanandra.
Something like...
Something that comes out your nose or something.
Trust me on this one, G.
Keep it up.
Got a job to do here.
Hey, Terry and Pete Nessip, United States Marshals.
May I have your ID, please?
Okay, sir.
Sign right here, please.
Shanandra, sounds like a nightclub.
Gordon Maples, United States Attorney's Office.
- Pete Nessip.
This is my brother Terry.
- Pete, Terry.
Remember when the DEA started electronically confiscating drug money
- from all the banks?
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Dealers started to wake up in the morning to find all their money gone.
So, this guy Leedy was the big computer wonk for the Chang Triad.
He figured out how to hide their money so we couldn't find it.
You mean that guy in there, coughing up furballs, is a genius?
He breaks codes that can't be broken.
It's like he lived inside the computers.
- How did he get caught?
- His ego.
He felt unappreciated, so I cut him a deal to testify and kept him out of sight for the last year and a half.
Now, two weeks from trial, they found him.
I need you guys to move Mr. Leedy up to the pen in Atlanta so I can keep him alive long enough to testify.
What about the cats?
We don't have to take the cats, too, do we?
welcome to Pac-Atlantic flight 611 to Atlanta with continuing service to Seattle.
Please make sure that all carry-on baggage is securely stowed...
Whoops!
It's okay.
That's what I'm here for, cat protection.
Cat protection.
Smooth, real smooth.
Okay, tight enough.
Are you sure you've fed the cats enough?
Agnes, she's got a little bit of a problem with low blood sugar.
Leedy, the cats will be better fed than we will on this plane.
You're not just saying that to make me feel better, are you?
- Now, why would I do that?
- What about the...
How can we make sure they can maintain the temperature in the baggage compartment?
What if they freeze?
I gotta get down and see the cats.
I want...
- Chill, man.
- What if they freeze?
Hey, excuse me.
- Would you like an aisle seat?
- That would be great.
Why are we not in first class?
We should be in first class.
The pleasure's all mine.
43 A and B. This is going to be great.
I'm warning you.
If anything happens to those cats, I'm gonna sue you.
You owe me, G.
You've ever heard of punitive damages, Mr. US Marshal?
We should be in first class, anyway.
- Miss, excuse me.
- Yes, sir.
I'm afraid to fly.
I need some water to take a sedative.
- Okay, no problem.
I'll be right with you.
- Doctor...
Okay, thanks.
we're getting some heavy weather, folks.
So I've got permission to climb to 38,000, see if we can get above it.
Bob, I think you'd better listen to this.
Pac-Air 611 Bravo, this is Miami Approach.
we just received a code-red transmission.
Would you care for some wine?
Thanks, but I only drink wine by candlelight.
Well, I might be able to help you with that.
Would you like to follow me?
Give me a break.
The captain needs to see you on the flight deck, right away.
Yeah.
- Gentlemen
- We just received this.
Flight 611, you are about to be taken over by Posse Comitus.
- Stay on your flight plan.
- Oh, brother.
No one will be hurt.
You'll receive further instructions in five minutes.
Over.
Hands up!
Okay!
Turn around, keep your head down.
I said keep your heads down!
Sit down.
Nobody move, God damn it.
If you do, I'll blow this plane to hell.
You understand?
Get off the phone.
You, too, God damn it.
Get down!
Get your heads down.
Feet on the floor.
Hands out of pockets.
You're not listening.
Both of you!
- Leedy, come with me.
- No, no, no!
No, don't do this.
No, please!
Please don't.
- How much time?
- Ten seconds.
Wait for now.
No, leave my hand.
No, that's my finger!
Jesus!
Be good now.
Be good boys and girls.
If you're not, I'll blow the plane up.
- what happened?
- Number 1 is down!
Talk to me!
Talk to me, Number 1.
I'm bulletproof. what are you?
Hey!
Help!
Now!
- What the hell?
- Shit!
We're losing cabin pressure.
Mayday!
Mayday!
This is Flight 611.
611 Heavy.
Declaring an emergency.
- We have emergency decompression.
...two and four.
We're over Ocala, in Florida.
We're...
Go!
Go!
I've got you.
Hang on.
Okay, hold on to me.
Hold on.
Okay.
Okay, hold on.
I've got you.
Grab her.
Hold her.
- Lena, hold on.
Hold on!
I've got her.
- Okay.
Okay.
Terry, hang on.
Hold on!
Help me!
Hang on, Terry.
- Help!
- Hold on.
I've got you.
Hold on.
Terry, you've gotta hold on!
I'm slipping!
- Terry!
- I won't let go of you!
- Hang on to me!
- No!
Don't...
Terry!
No!
No, Terry!
No.
- Glenn Blackstone, agent in charge, FBI.
- Bob Covington.
Tom McCracken, US Marshal's Office.
Listen, I'm looking for my guy, Pete Nessip.
- Supposed to...
- Pete's over there.
Pete.
Pete, did you see anything?
Two, three, maybe more.
You didn't hear anything?
Their names or anything?
The little girl, I reached for her and I grabbed her.
And...
They shot Terry.
Motherfuckers.
He was bad.
He was real bad.
The blood was everywhere and I...
He was falling.
I grabbed him and I had him.
- I couldn't hold him.
- Oh, my God.
I couldn't hold him.
Bring up the passenger list and seating assignment.
Okay, break down the ticket purchase into cash and credit card.
Cross-check that with advance purchase and same-day purchase.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- It's some kind of virus or worm, sir.
- Well, get it back.
I'm trying, but the whole system's going down.
- It's Leedy...
- What?
- It was a setup.
- A what?
- A setup.
- What are you saying, Nessip?
- A prison break at 30,000 feet?
- Yeah, why not?
So, what did they do?
Come down and pick him up in a goddamn spaceship?
Look, I tackled one of the guys.
He had some sort of pack on his back.
- Maybe it was a parachute.
- What about Leedy, now?
He jumps out, opens up an umbrella and floats down like Mary Poppins?
- Nobody saw a parachute.
- Nobody could see anything.
Their heads were down and the plane was filled with smoke.
What 32 people did see was they saw your brother fire at a man wrapped in explosives.
That's a lie!
Wait a minute, what is this?
The FBI get brownie points for speed?
We're talking about my brother here, man.
Look, isn't that worth the investigation?
- You want an investigation?
- Yes!
Two hours after the explosion, an airline maintenance man was gunned down at Miami airport running away from MPD detention.
And in his apartment they found Posse Comitus literature and homemade C-4 explosives.
The maintenance man put the explosives on board?
That's right.
Detective Fox, Miami PD, recognized the man from the pre-flight inspection.
I'm telling you...
Look, we all feel bad about what happened to your brother, and don't nobody want to paint him the fall guy.
But the fact of the matter is your brother opened fire on that plane and panicked, and 14 people are dead.
My brother didn't panic.
Sir, Forensics just got a positive ID on one of the remains found on the plane.
Your prisoner, Leedy.
Damn!
Through the coordinated investigation of federal, state and local law enforcement officials, the FBI believes that it has answered most of the questions concerning the attempted hijack of Pac-Atlantic Air Flight 611.
It was the Marshal on board who set off the explosion.
Is that true?
That question has been raised and is under investigation...
Hey, guys!
Guys, check it out!
- They're buying it top to bottom.
- Of course they're buying it.
Baby doll, you talk about a rush, man.
We went out that fucking door, that wind hit you like a goddamn freight train.
I'm dragging away from the jet,
I come face to face with this woman, and I swear, she was still holding a magazine.
Has Leedy finished throwing up?
- Yes.
- Good.
No, no, no, don't touch my hand, lady!
Don't!
No!
Don't touch my hand!
- Watch out!
Don't touch my hand!
- Earl, come here!
Don't touch my hand!
Shut up and say thank you.
- Thank you?
- Yes!
You threw me out of an airplane and you bit off my finger.
- You have nine good ones.
- Well, how am I supposed to do my work?
You crashed the entire airline computer system with one hand, didn't you?
The information we have is sketchy right now, but what we're hearing is that the Marshal allegedly fired at a hijacker, and according to passengers, set off the explosion which killed 14 people, including the hijackers.
Yes!
Unload the boat.
Unload the boat.
...and a federal prisoner by the name of Earl Leedy.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, they think I'm dead.
Does that mean I'm free?
You're not free.
Your ass belongs to me.
And I'm gonna make it worth your while.
But wait, he mentioned only two Marshals.
What about the other Marshal that was on the plane?
He's dead.
He's dead.
I shot him.
I don't think so.
He was in the bathroom.
Listen to me!
All he saw was smoke.
We got out clean, except for that bitch that grabbed you, Jagger.
Next time, you just get her and throw her out the door.
I'll buy you breakfast.
Come on, let's go.
Breakfast.
- What you got, Deuce?
- I got homemade grits and eggs.
How are you doing, Pete?
I need to talk to you.
It's important.
So is this.
Wait till you see what I found.
I got it nailed down to a two-square-mile radius where the hijackers could've landed.
We've got our bodies, Pete.
Yeah, but the only bodies we've got that are burned beyond recognition are those of the terrorists and that prick Leedy.
Does that make any sense?
Pete, nobody jumps from a 747 at that altitude and speed and lives.
- Period.
You understand that?
- No, no, no, that's where you're wrong.
Look, a SEAL team did it.
Jumped out of a 727 three years ago.
I'm telling you, it's a setup.
Now all I have to do is figure out how Leedy fits into all this.
What?
The Board of Review is looking at this in two weeks...
The Board of Review!
...to determine yours and Terry's responsibility for the accident.
- What responsibility?
- Pete, listen to me.
The FAA and the airline's in the middle of a goddamn firestorm with the media, the insurance companies, relatives of dead passengers...
Nobody wants to hear about skydiving.
Skydiving from 747s!
They're looking to point fingers at somebody, and you and Terry are it.
Don't you understand that?
You know the SOP on this.
I have to ask you for your badge and your gun.
- What?
You're suspending me?
- Pete, please, you know the rules.
Give me your badge and your gun, please.
I don't care.
I'm not quitting on this.
I took a team out in a commercial jet.
Delta Squad deployment, hostage-drill scenario.
- So it can be done?
- We did it.
But it was a 727 at 20,000 feet.
And it was a drill, no explosions.
A 747 at 38,000 feet, I doubt it.
Plus, you got another problem.
- Petty Officer.
- Yes, sir.
You see this?
You see this D-ring?
High-density metal.
Now, your terrorists may have had somebody stash a few guns behind a seat, but not five parachute rigs.
Five rigs going through X-ray and metal detectors would raise holy hell with airport security.
- Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.
So, with the right equipment, it is possible.
Mister, to even think about jumping from a 747 you've either got to be very skilled or dick-brained.
- Now, which one do you wanna talk to?
- What do you mean?
Well, skilled is a guy named Don Jagger.
World-champion skydiver.
Dick-brained is his old partner, Jess Crossman.
Where can I find them?
I don't think they jump together anymore, but Crossman lives real close to here.
- Jess Crossman?
- Not today, man.
- Do you know where I can find him?
- You must be with the class.
Check upstairs.
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem, dude.
Be right out.
Damn!
- What was that?
- Can you believe that?
Now you listen here to me.
I hope you're good at fixing toilets, because you're never, ever gonna fix another plane of mine.
I got my new chute in.
You want to take me up later?
I'll take your face off if you don't come and fix this plane right.
Where did you learn how to fix planes?
Mr. Goodwrench?
This isn't a waiting room, and the next load is booked.
Damn.
And I really wanted to get on that plane.
DEA, FBI or local?
Jess Crossman.
If you want to talk to me, you're either a skydiver or a cop.
And, well, you definitely don't look like any skydiver I have ever seen.
You know, cops, I don't like them.
Every time you've met one has been right after you've broken the law.
Yeah.
Did I go out of state without calling my parole officer?
Yes, I admit it.
But it was an emergency.
You're not here about a parole violation?
Have you heard about a hijacking of a 747?
Yeah.
Hear about it, how could I miss it?
What a major screwup!
What if it wasn't a screwup?
What if someone just wanted to make it look that way?
- Why?
- To grab a prisoner I was escorting.
A jump.
A jailbreak from a 747?
That's a cool idea.
No offense.
- Could you do it?
- What, am I a suspect?
Why do you ask?
Well, because people probably told you that Jessie Crossman was the only person skilled enough to jump from a 747.
Well, the actual phrase used was "dick-brained."
And I checked.
You were with your parole officer.
Look, some yahoo pulled a John Wayne on that flight and got a lot of people killed, all right?
That's not what happened, Ms. Crossman.
And that yahoo was my brother.
Well, God.
I'm sorry about that.
But if I'm not a suspect, then I don't have to talk to you, do I?
You still haven't answered the question about the jump.
See, the longer I stand here, the broker I get.
So...
You want to talk to me about jumping, you can pay like everyone else, right, Mr. Cop?
We'll see.
What do I need this getup for if I don't have a chute?
It's my drop zone, it's my rules.
Wait a minute, now.
You're not scared, are you?
No.
Hey, wait!
Hold on!
Wait for me!
All right, give me a controlled exit and a good arch.
Ready, set, go!
I don't get the attraction.
You know, haven't you ever watched a bird gliding on the wind
- and wished you could do it?
- Yeah, for about 20 seconds.
You know, you just don't get it, do you?
What could be so difficult about jumping out of an airplane?
You count to 20, you pull the damn string and that's it.
Let the air sculpt your body position, all right?
Ready, set, go!
- Yes!
- Jesus...
Can you see the way the wind forces the...
Come here.
Can you see the way the wind forces their bodies open?
We're only at 80 knots.
A 747 at 500 knots would rip a jumper clean apart.
And that, my friend, is where the skill comes in.
No big deal.
You are way out of your league up here, cowboy.
Way out.
I hear you talking all this stuff about skill.
If you're so good, how come you're still working in this shithole?
What?
What, you need to be hooked on phonics?
Shit hole.
Shithole.
Hey!
He paid for one jump, I might as well give him one.
For Christ's sake, just go get him, okay?
All right.
Help!
Get off of me!
Get off of me.
You kicked me.
Wait!
Come back!
Come back!
Come back!
- Help me!
- I've got you.
You're crazy!
- Hold still.
- Get me out of this.
I thought you did okay.
Welcome to the sky!
You fell, you lived, good start.
Now you fell, you lived, I'm gone.
You're out of your damn mind.
There are things in here.
Hey!
Hey, I didn't know she was going to do that, okay?
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah?
I bet it was a whole lot safer than landing with you in that damn plane of yours.
Where can I find Don Jagger?
There's a big jump this weekend at Ocean Reef.
All the hot ones will be there.
That's your best bet, man.
Thank you.
Skydivers are a real tight group.
You're gonna have a tough time breaking in by yourself.
Well, I'll take my chances, thank you very much.
Hey, you know, Jess didn't mean anything by that.
Ever since Jagger went south on her she's been a little touchy.
What happened to Jagger?
He says he got conned into making some drug jumps.
He did a little time.
She did a little time, too.
- They never patched things up.
- Why would she want to?
She's loyal.
I'd give her that much.
What do you think?
I think it's time for you to zip it.
And let's go on and get that rammerjammy fixed on the tail, all right?
- Nice jump, man.
- Yeah, right!
Shit!
I'll kill you.
Please, don't push me.
Don't let me...
Wait.
No, wait.
No!
- Nice landing.
- Good.
Good.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come on, come on, come on...
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- I can't.
I can't.
- Hit it, brother.
Hit it, brother.
Hit it.
- I can't, I'm sorry...
- Leedy, do your job.
I need a minute to steady myself.
When we break in, we don't have minutes, we have seconds.
- It's the jump.
Don't...
It's the jump.
- Now, do it.
- I can't think.
- Jump him until he can.
Maybe he's had enough for one day, all right?
I haven't had enough for one day.
Jump him till he can, come on.
- Please.
I can't think.
- Come on.
Up and at 'em.
- Go!
Come on!
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Up and at 'em.
Come on, let's go.
- I don't want to jump anymore!
- Come on, go!
This is going to be a snap.
God, this is easy.
They're not going to know what hit them.
- Hi, Joy Willins.
- I'm Pete.
- Pete.
Yeah.
- It's a pleasure.
Miami Police.
They've been really great.
Come on, Lena's around back.
Look what I've got for you.
Thank you.
That's to replace the one that you lost on the plane.
Maybe it'll make you feel a little better.
Lena, do you remember me?
Remember that your tiger bumped me upside the head when we were on the plane?
Do you remember anything about your plane trip?
Maybe that there was something strange happening, there was noise, yelling?
No, I fell asleep and when I woke up we were already landed.
I'm going to show you some pictures and I want you to look at them very carefully.
This is the plane that we were on.
Remember?
Remember the plane?
And then something went wrong.
Something happened.
There was a loud noise.
There was a lot of smoke.
- A big noise?
- A big noise.
There was a lot of wind and people were yelling and screaming.
Do you remember if you saw anyone?
Help me!
- What are you doing?
- Do you remember anything about what he may have been wearing or...
What?
He wore glasses?
He...
The scar.
He had a scar?
Lena, was this the man that you saw on the plane?
You can tell me, nobody's gonna hurt you.
Look, see, he has a scar.
Is this the man?
All right, okay.
Look, look.
That's enough, okay?
- That's enough.
Could you please go now?
- See, he has a scar.
- Was this the man you saw?
- Let's end it.
I'm gonna get the detectives.
- You can answer, it's okay.
- Detective Wallace!
- That's all right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Please.
- Thank you, Lena.
I'm sorry.
- Come on, it's all right.
That's all right.
Yes!
Detective Fox, Miami Metro.
Concerning that plane accident you're investigating.
The other US Marshal on the plane has acquired some information.
- The other Marshal?
- That's correct.
The young lady on the plane, she gave him a partial ID of one of the hijackers.
A scar under his right eye.
- I'm impressed.
- Thank you.
Not with you, with the other Marshal.
Hang on, I wanna come with you.
- Hey, Don.
- Hey.
You're mine now.
Where I go, you go.
Let me go or lose me forever.
I'm serious.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Hey.
Ty, what are you doing?
Hey, hey, let me go.
What are you doing?
Let me go!
Hey!
Hey!
Damn it!
Hey, God damn it!
Let me go!
Let me go!
You son of a bitch!
It's all over.
Bye-bye.
No!
Cool move, papa.
You see that?
9-1-1 is not gonna work for him.
What you just saw there can happen to any one of you.
Our skydiving team is now four strong.
No problems with that.
Oh, God.
Did you ever jump those round chutes?
You can't steer the damn things and you never know where they're gonna come down.
I got enough branches up my ass to start a pulpwood mill.
Hi.
I'd like...
I don't know, maybe...
A minute to wait for you to come back.
- Look at this guy.
- What's he doing at our table?
I don't think he gets it.
Let's explain it to him.
Yeah.
Here it goes.
This is going to get messy.
Hey, guys, I'm sitting in your seats?
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Can I offer you a beer?
- Sure.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Hey, hey, come on, man.
If you wanted me to move, you just should have asked.
Jesus!
Take it.
Get these guys a beer.
Get him a pillow.
- Nessip.
- Bob.
Nice to meet you, Bob.
See you up there.
Well, I see you've met some skydivers.
You're not much of a cop, but you sure do make friends easy.
If you blow my cover, I'm gonna bust your ass right back to prison.
Do you understand me?
Looks like you're doing a good job of blowing your own cover.
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Last time I did that, I got into a fight.
Look, buddy, at the moment we're the only cover you've got.
Have a seat.
Look, all I want to do is talk to your friend Jagger.
Okay, then here's what I want.
There's a big exhibition jump in DC next weekend.
I want to go, but my parole officer won't let me.
- Keep talking.
- Well, see, you got a big problem here.
The only way you're gonna learn anything is if you hang out with the best.
And right now, you're kind of sticking out like a Cub Scout in a whorehouse.
Bad news, man, you're not gonna believe what happened.
I reach your parole officer and you work me in with these guys, right?
And another thing...
Burn in.
Drinks up!
Blue skies!
- Black death!
- Black death!
What the hell is that?
It means some skydiver somewhere burned in today.
- What does that mean?
- As in, crash landed.
Dead.
They're gonna ring that bell and raise a toast every hour till midnight.
- Great tradition.
- Who hammered in?
Jagger.
Damn!
The cops found him with a fat sack of cocaine on him.
He was stuck up in some power lines.
Power lines?
What, he just floated into the power lines, Sel?
It's just what I heard.
I'm sorry.
- No, that's not possible.
- Jessie, I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
If you want my help, you pay for me and the airplane.
- Okay, how much?
- $15,000.
- $15,000?
- That's what it costs.
What do you care, anyway?
It's the government's money.
I don't work for the government anymore.
I'll talk to you later.
What's up, man?
- Good news.
Good news, Mr. Moncrief.
- What's that?
Our client has found your offer quite interesting.
We're all just a little concerned about the fact that you used to be an agent for the DEA.
Used to be.
Used to be is why I'm worth something to you.
Right, right, well your past leaves a bad taste in our client's mouth.
You have to do better than that.
If the taste was bad, gentlemen, you wouldn't be here.
What I'm offering you, no one else in the world can provide.
No one else.
I'm willing to prove it by doing it one time for free.
Then when we meet again, you tell your boss to bring his wallet.
Payment in full.
Simple as that.
Then we have a deal.
Thanks for lunch.
Let's go.
Go!
You're up.
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready!
Torski, these are computers.
- Silent movies for 400, please.
- Answer there...
Who is Jackie Cooper?
Coogan.
Jackie Coogan, stupid...
- We gotta go.
- Damn it.
Give me some space!
Hey, how are you doing?
I've got a surprise for you here.
My God.
Look at this.
Too bad we're not in the drug business.
- Come on, Leedy.
- I've almost got it.
- There.
- Where are you...
Can I help with anything?
You're making me nervous.
Would you just get away?
You got two minutes, Earl.
- What can I do to help you?
- I've got access.
Good.
Good.
- I'm into the system.
- Yes.
- Wanna run this up to the evidence locker?
- You got it, babe.
Hey, Judy, Judy, wait up.
Baby, don't come down here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey.
- The elevator's coming up.
- Roger that.
- Earl, we have to close that now.
- Okay!
Okay!
All right, okay.
Here they come.
Look at him.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
- We've got to go.
Close it down.
- Don't rush me.
They'll know we were here.
You did good.
Move it.
Stay.
Go!
Go!
- we're moving, Torski.
- Got you.
Oh, yeah.
God damn it!
Fucking Leedy threw up all over me.
The daring late-night theft netted criminals over $50,000 worth of drugs stolen from this protective enclosure.
The thieves hid out in the building's maintenance area until everyone had gone home.
An intensive Internal Affairs review is underway, since access to these areas is strictly limited to station personnel.
Reporting from Miami headquarters, I'm Diana Morales.
Back to you.
I have to admit it, you're good, but so am I.
Here come your Miami undercover agents.
Finally.
These narcs are walking around somewhere thinking they're alive.
Excellent.
Thank you, carry on.
So, is that it?
- Am I done?
- No, a little while longer.
Is this the Marshal, the other Marshal?
The one on the plane?
- You told me you took care of him.
- Don't worry about him.
What do you mean, don't worry about it?
The guy you killed is his brother.
Leedy!
I said don't worry about him.
I'll take care of my end of it, okay?
- Radical.
- All right, man, right behind you.
Yeah, I'm ready, man.
- Where's your car?
- Don't ask.
- Well, very, very cool bike.
- Air time.
Where's my team?
All right, all right, they're upstairs.
- All right.
- Come on.
Looking good, guys.
Good formation.
That's great.
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, Jess.
- How you doing?
- How you doing, baby?
I'm getting together a team for the DC jump.
What about it?
- Hell, yes.
Are you kidding me?
- Cool.
Have you seen Swoop around?
No, not for a while.
I heard that crazy bastard was living on the street, though.
Yeah, right.
What else is new?
I think I know where he's at.
We'll find him and Hockridge and we've got ourselves a team.
- I'm in.
Good to see you.
- All right.
Good to see you.
Jess, come here.
Hockridge is out, he busted his ankle.
- What?
- It wasn't even on a jump.
He slipped getting out of the bathtub.
But, you see, I figure I could take his place, no problem.
What have you logged, sweet pea, a whole 20 jumps?
Come on, Jess, when was the last time you actually saw me jump?
No, he is looking a lot better, Jess.
I've been giving him some extra air time.
- He's good.
- You give me half the chance,
- I'll slice the sky to pieces.
- Look, Selly, I don't need an Indiana Jones.
I need somebody who's good and who takes orders, period.
Well, I like the kid's attitude.
He's got a lot of enthusiasm.
I think he does, too, but enthusiasm can get you killed up there.
Thank you, Pete.
- I can get Burt, he'll be here next week.
- No, I can't deal with Burt.
Can I have your attention, please?
All right, Selly, you're in.
But here's the drill.
First of all, you're our mechanic, so please keep the plane flying.
Second of all, if you hotdog on me, you're gone.
And third, Winona, keep a watch on the extra air time.
Come on, let's go.
I'm taking Pete, we're gonna go find Swoop.
- Swoop?
He's a nutcase.
- Swoop is cool.
Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop you.
- I'm jumping, right?
- Jumping out of a plane?
No, I need you alive to deal with my probation officer.
- Come on, Jess, I'm serious.
- So am I. I'm a good teacher, but nobody's good enough to get you up to exhibition level in a week.
Jess, here's the deal.
Something tells me I'm not going to find who I'm looking for down here, right?
So, I gotta go up there.
If I don't jump, we've got no deal.
All right, you're an alternate, you train, but you don't jump the exhibition.
Way to go, kid.
- Swoop.
- Why are we up here, again?
Swoop!
What the hell would he be doing over there?
Swoop!
Over here.
- Hey, Swoop.
- Hey!
- What are you doing?
- Jeez.
How about this, huh?
The fine folks of this building asked if I'd just come out here and do a few windows, this and that.
- I need you for a team, Swoop.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
How much does it pay?
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
All your jumps are paid for.
So, how about those jumps, there, Jess, are they paid for?
- Yeah, they are.
- Didn't I just say that to him?
Yeah, but if he hasn't jumped with you, he won't talk to you.
He won't.
Well, I am going to have to require a free T-shirt, Jess.
- What?
Can we get him a free T-shirt?
- Yes.
Tell him he can have a T-shirt.
- Okay.
Free T, Swoop.
Whatever you want.
- Yeah!
- Swoop.
Yeah.
- My lucky day.
Here, give me a hand.
All right!
It opened.
That ain't funny.
That ain't funny, man.
Did you know about this?
Find what you're looking for?
- How long have you been following me?
- Ever since you decided to be my friend.
What's this all about?
When a skydiver burns in, the cops bring the rig to a safety officer for inspection.
- And this is Jagger's.
- And...
What?
There's nothing wrong with this rig.
Which means he would have had to screw up big time in order to float into those power lines.
And there's no way that happened.
He had help.
- Aren't these supposed to be metal?
- Yeah, it's a smuggler's rig.
- A what?
- It's a smuggler's rig.
Drug runners custom-make them out of high-density fabric to escape radar.
- There's no metal in them.
- Would these pass through airport security?
- Yeah, probably.
- Damn!
What?
Pete!
Put this back right where you found it, all right?
You listen to me, these people are killers.
You leave the cop stuff to me.
All right.
- Milton.
- Mike. wake up, Mike.
This is Nessip.
Pete.
What?
I got an envelope that I'm delivering to you with a piece of nylon in it.
I want you to examine it for explosives, all right?
Explosives?
Nylons?
Are you dating that Mongolian feminist again?
Look, I need your help on this, Mike.
I thought you were on suspension...
Vacation.
Suspension.
You can say it.
Yeah, I am.
That's why I need you to do this for me.
Just examine it for explosives, alloys, powder, whatever you can find.
Anything.
This is the Justice Department.
We don't have time for that.
Mike, just do it, okay?
All right.
And don't tell them it's for me, or else they'll fire your ass.
Why can't you just be calling to borrow money like usual, Pete?
Hey.
- Let's go.
- Go in.
Come on!
Get in there.
Yeah, watch this.
- He isn't balancing at all.
- Yeah.
See?
Beautiful!
- Watch it coming down.
- I love it.
Oh, yeah!
Crash and burn.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
I love it!
I love it!
What a ride!
What a ride!
Need for speed.
That was great!
That was great!
It was incredible!
How did I do?
Come on, what's with him?
I jumped with him.
What's the deal?
I don't think he counts what you just did as a jump.
He's kind of funny that way.
Well, what kind of other jump is there?
There's only one kind ofjump and I did a sweet one, if I must say.
My buddy, Luxem, ran the lab on your nylon.
This is serious guacamole.
Look at this.
He found C-4 explosive, flash-bang residue, high-grade alloys.
I mean, you ain't dealing with a cat burglar, Pete.
Yeah, but it means I'm in the right place.
Tell your friend I owe him one.
No need, I promised him you'd paint his house this summer.
The chopper's aboard.
Good to see you.
Hey, how you doing?
Good to see you again.
- How are you?
- Good to see you.
- Welcome.
Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.
- Follow me, please.
- We've tested your free sample and decided we want more.
There's only one way you're gonna get more.
Your price is rather large.
So are the results.
Good evening, everyone.
Welcome aboard.
I'm only interested in long-term investments.
What happens when the DEA replaces their dead agents?
And they will.
You're buying a very sophisticated data service.
Once we're in the DEA computer, we're in, and we'll update you whenever they do.
And the charge for this update?
$2 million a month for the operations and names of every undercover DEA agent in the world.
What can I say?
When do we see the list?
The day after Thomas Jefferson died, July 5th.
God bless America.
All right, settle down, everybody, settle down.
And welcome to DC.
Yeah!
The jump tomorrow is one you're gonna tell your grandchildren about.
We're jumping into the city's fireworks display and coming right down in Potomac Park.
That's right.
Everybody settle down.
That's right, a 34-way carousel dive.
Got Jack in the center surrounded by a nine-way star, outside of that, a 24-way star.
The judges today determine who gets to jump tomorrow, and who doesn't.
You wanna be in a big fireworks show, you'd better fly your butts off.
You need 10 points or better to qualify.
That's all I've got to say.
Let's load them up and skydive!
- Four hundred, 450.
Something like that.
- No.
- What kind of competition is that?
- A vicious competition, man.
Ten points I gotta get?
Hey, Swoop, how did you fix in with this group, man?
- It's a little embarrassing, isn't it?
- It's all right.
It's all right.
What are you, a comedian?
Why don't you fuck off?
Nice landing, man!
- You are bad!
- That's my man.
My chute!
- All right.
All right.
Okay.
- All right.
Okay, that's 10 points for Moncrief's team.
- That's 10 points for Crossman's team.
- Both teams qualify.
Hey, Torski, watch your butt!
Hey!
Hey!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Hey, get the hell out of my face, man.
- Hey!
Hey, you, you son of a bitch.
- Merry Christmas, asshole.
- Holy shit.
What's that guy doing?
- It looks like a gift wrap.
Rock and roll!
God damn it!
Get away from me.
Get away from me.
Son of a bitch!
Get away.
No, get the hell away from me!
Bunch of assholes!
High five.
- Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop!
- Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop!
Thank you.
- Who's the guy with Torski?
- Ty Moncrief.
He's military or something.
He shows up now and then for big jumps.
I got to go strangle the weasel.
You do that, Pete.
- That guy was right.
- We'll mess things up.
- Look who's here, Deucie.
- Knock yourself out, man.
- Mr. Comedian.
- We're just jumpers, here.
- What do you think you're doing, sport?
- Can't we all just...
You think it's funny?
You wanna play with me?
You son of a bitch.
How are you doing now, sport?
You wanna do this?
You want to play with me, son?
How do you like that?
Shit!
- Yeah, the toilet's stopped up, man.
- Yeah?
- Why don't you go use a tree?
- A tree?
- Yeah, right there, see?
- Okay.
That's okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm environmentally conscious.
Why don't you try this on for a while?
Hey, man, none of this is any of your business, unless you want me to make it such, so why don't you get out of here?
You fuck with my team, you fuck with me.
Hey, fuck you and fuck your team.
I look out for everyone.
Come on.
Come on.
Swoop.
Swoop.
Watch your head.
Come on.
What?
So, what about this Ty Moncrief?
Jagger did a couple of drug carries for them three years ago.
Thanks.
Is he good enough to be one of the people I'm looking for?
If I find out that he killed Jagger, it won't matter how good he is.
Well, why would he risk showing his face around here?
I mean, what's so special about this DC jump?
Well, the 4th-of-July exhibition, Pete, it's the biggest thing in the world.
I mean, Washington, DC is a drop zone.
Any other day, it's the most restricted air space.
That's why every skydiver worth his ass wants in on this load.
- Where exactly are they putting down?
- Sel, pass me that map.
Please.
Thank you.
It's right there, right by the Washington Monument.
You mean a jumper could put down anyplace he wanted to?
I myself am going to make a landing right in Abe Lincoln's lap.
Jess, you tell the new guy, "Thanks."
Thanks.
Yeah, tell him, "Anytime." I enjoyed it.
- Can I keep this?
- Sure.
All right, see you, guys.
That's him.
That's what I've been trying to tell you all along.
- I know.
I know.
- And I'm telling you, we'd better take this son of a bitch out
- before he shuts us down.
- Shut up.
Shut up.
This is real simple.
Cops can smell dead cops 100 miles away.
We keep their team on the ground, they'll never touch us.
- I see.
So how do you plan on doing that?
- By taking out their leader.
Crossman.
This is Jessie's trailer.
Not much longer, man, we've gotta move.
Have a nice trip.
Patrick, get this off to Chicago and wait for the fax.
It's number six.
Tom.
- Holy shit.
What the hell happened to you?
- I've got to talk to you.
Come on in here.
Patrick, let me know when that comes in.
Working undercover while on suspension violates your sworn oath.
Not to mention 20 different laws.
- Me accessing his file makes it 21.
- I'm in the middle of them.
As a matter of fact, I found one of the chutes from the 747.
- Did you know that?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
If you've got evidence, make your case to the FBI.
You're going to have to do better than this Ty Moncrief fellow.
He's DEA.
See that?
- Moncrief is DEA?
- Honorably discharged eight months ago.
I'll bring his service record up so you can see it.
What the hell's going on with this computer?
Leedy.
Peter.
Pete!
Okay, folks, check it out.
Demo jumpers, we've got about a 12-minute call to dress rehearsal.
Twelve-minute call.
Let's nail this one, puppies.
we've gotta nail this one.
- Guys, has anyone seen Nessip?
- Who?
No.
Pete.
No.
What's your problem, ace?
What's the matter, sweet pea?
Nothing, I mean, I'm not the pro here,
I don't want to be the one to screw things up.
Sel, you're not going to screw anything up.
Listen to me.
This rig, it logged two world titles for Jagger and one for me, all right?
You wanna wear this?
This mean I don't have to wear that stupid helmet?
Sel, no, you don't gotta wear the stupid helmet.
How's that, all right?
- Yeah!
Let's jump!
- The star!
- I'm ready.
- Hold on, hotdog.
- Time to go.
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's get out there.
- Do it!
Shit.
Somebody didn't open.
Selkirk, cut away.
Damn it.
Cut away.
I can't get it.
Cut away.
4,000 feet.
Swoop, get him.
God damn.
- Two grand.
Pull it!
- Pull it!
- Pull it.
- Pull it.
Come on, pull.
Come on.
Paramedics to the water area now!
We need a medic over here.
- God, what happened to him?
- It's not good.
Sel, can you hear us?
Please.
God damn it, get this off him.
- Stay with us, Selly.
- Oh, Bobby, he's not breathing.
- He's not breathing.
- He tried to pull it, it just wouldn't work.
- God.
Get up!
- Here we go.
Get us a medic, God damn it.
Stay with us, Selly.
- I hear it.
I hear it.
- Yeah!
Yeah!
Selkirk, buddy.
- He's breathing.
He's breathing.
- There you go.
- He's breathing.
- Look out, let me in here.
- Look out.
You all right?
- He's breathing.
Okay.
Good job.
Good job.
- You're going to be okay.
- You're gonna be okay, buddy.
- Can you hear me?
- It's okay.
- Sel.
- Take it easy.
- We're right here, buddy.
- Sorry, guys, but you can't stay in here.
We're going to stay right here with you, buddy, all right?
You can meet us at the hospital, but nobody rides in the van.
- Bullshit, we're family.
- Nobody.
Hey, guys, don't worry about it, right?
You guys have gotta jump anyway.
Get the hell out of here.
Just tell Jess her rig's broken.
All right, man, we'll see you at the hospital.
Where the hell is Jessie?
Winona, let's get this plane in the air.
We're going after Ty's plane.
- Who's this?
- I'm a US Marshal.
Now, you can read about it later.
No way, later.
We're going.
Come on.
Crank it up.
- I want to jump!
- Okay, let's go.
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go!
Bye-bye.
Let's go.
Chutes on.
Let's go.
Here we go.
We're so close to pulling this off.
All you have to do...
Hey, surprise!
Only one of you really has to die.
So tell me, who killed Jagger?
How about me?
You wanna try me?
You come here, I'll shoot you right in between the fucking eyes!
Jesus, Jessie, bad idea...
You look like a little boy without a chute, Jessie.
- I knew it was you, Ty.
- Stay there.
You don't know what you're doing.
No.
You don't know what the fuck you're doing.
Let me tell you about Jagger.
He betrayed you.
He left you in prison to rot like jailbait.
This is his girlfriend.
You meant nothing to him.
He's dead.
You're on the wrong...
Sit down.
Get off of me.
- Get off.
- Throw her out.
Throw her out.
Jump.
Jump, Jessie, I dare you.
- Oh, shit.
- Jess.
- She's got a lot ofjuice.
- Yeah, but she ain't got no wings, man.
Let's go, get our chutes on.
We've lost them.
They sure as hell weren't tracking for the fireworks.
I know where Ty's headed.
He's going to the DEA building.
Right near the drop zone.
- Should I radio for backup?
- Yeah, right.
First they'll laugh at you, then they'll throw your ass in jail.
Jesus, Mary, priest!
Jessie.
She's hanging on the footrail.
What the hell is she doing?
I know exactly what she's doing.
It's the only trick I know.
- Swoop, what are you doing?
- I'm not going to miss this.
...reveals nothing.
I suggest his mind has been so conditioned as part of a preconceived plan.
God damn, look at this dweeb.
You think by the 23rd century they'd have better toupees than that.
- They all wear wigs on that show.
- Not Spock.
- He got the ears.
- What the hell are you talking about?
All clear up here.
I'm going to the 19th floor.
Little power hit.
Probably burning down the kitchen again.
Joanne, are you cooking again?
we've had a couple power spikes.
No, you guys want to order a pizza?
I'm starving.
All right, we're in.
- Radio check.
- One.
- Two.
- Three.
Clear.
Not now.
There is no logic in Thelev's attack upon the Captain.
There is no logic...
Okay.
- Is it going to work?
- It's going to work.
Come on, come on, come on.
Go, go, go, go, go.
- Leedy.
Earl.
Earl!
- Leedy, quickly.
Where are you?
Come on.
- We're all clear.
- Good.
Okay, we're into the game.
Come on.
How smart can one man be?
Jimmy Sansome, Jesus Christ, that guy used to hit on me.
This guy's a Fed?
- Deuce, run code blue.
Are you ready?
- Yeah, copy, Ty.
I'm ready to rock and roll.
It's cool up here.
The chutes are ready.
- What the...
- Look out!
What's the matter, you can't fly?
Swoop, get away from the door.
Follow me.
Come on, get him up.
You're dead, dead.
Thank God!
Listen up.
Stage 1 is completed.
Stay focused, we're right on schedule.
Yeah.
Well, the schedule's gonna change.
- Come on.
Are you okay?
- There you go.
- Swoop, stay here.
Don't rob him, okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
Okay, okay.
- I'm going for help.
- Okay, easy, take it easy.
Easy.
She's going for help.
What the hell?
Joanne, come back to me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got you.
Joanne, we've got a circuit trip, says a washer trolley is moving.
Check it out, will you?
Hi, we might be under attack from Klingons.
Maybe they got food.
Okay, I'm on my way.
I'll be back.
Ty, the elevator's moving.
Stop it on this floor.
I'm coming to meet you.
Stay with Leedy.
Hey!
Quiet, quiet, quiet.
Give him the gun, give him the gun.
It's okay, don't panic.
Why don't you radio down and tell them everything's fine, you're okay?
Tell them you're fine.
Nothing going on up here.
We're still getting a washer-trolley signal, though.
- Probably just a short.
- Roger.
Yeah, thank you.
You're dismissed.
You take care of her.
I'm letting them know.
Oh, my God!
- Fuck!
- What?
Whoa!
God damn it!
You go up on the roof.
Kara, check the floor.
I'm coming with Leedy.
I'm with the magician.
You're on the roof.
I need you.
Come on, come on, let's go.
- All right, Leedy, I'm right outside.
- What?
Where are you going?
Hey!
Shit!
I'm calling for backup.
Call the fire department, too.
We got smoke on the 20th floor.
Right.
Close it out.
Close it out.
Now!
- Ty...
- You little...
God damn it.
Kara.
- Are you proud of yourself?
- Ty, get off me.
Come on.
Come on, go, go.
I'll be right back, okay?
Okay, I'll be right nearby.
- Right nearby, okay?
- All right.
All right.
Jessie?
Jessie, what do you want me to do?
Jessie...
- Leedy, don't you move.
- What?
Wait, wait.
No, wait, wait.
- Don't move.
- You got them.
You got them.
You've got them on hijacking, murder, smuggling, kidnapping, cruelty to animals.
Look what they did to me.
They took my finger...
Thought you'd get away from me, huh?
Earl.
Earl, you disappoint me.
They're going to put you away if you go in.
Who's your friend?
Look, I was just trying to stall them for you.
You're the reason your little brother's dead, you idiot.
Families shouldn't fly together.
That's all right, you'll meet him again.
I guarantee that.
And when you do, he's gonna bust your ass.
You try and stop me, or bring me somewhere, you're fucked!
He's bluffing, Jessie.
He needs this little bastard.
Don't you think about it!
Shoot him, shoot him dead!
Freeze!
Drop your weapons.
I said drop them!
Leedy?
Leedy!
Shit!
I'm going for it.
Oh, Jesus.
Look, guys, is this really necessary?
I'm not that hurt.
You know, I've been through worse than this before.
I will personally write the President and recommend that you receive commendation for your actions.
Now, if you'll just maintain your stations here, and secure this location,
I'll be checking the rest of the area.
- Jerry.
- Dupont, Ted.
- Yes, very good work.
- With a "J."
Leedy.
Leedy.
Leedy, you come back here.
Leedy.
Leedy.
Stop that guy.
Stop.
The one with the bozo hairdo.
Leedy.
Jesus, listen to me.
Listen to me.
He's wearing a DEA jacket.
Stop...
Leedy, you come...
Leedy!
Leedy!
Stop that guy.
No way.
Don't make me roll after you.
You better not make me roll after you.
Yeah, that guy right there.
He's one of the bad guys.
Fucking awesome, man.
Way to go, Swoop!
Hey, man, it's the other leg, man.
- All right, I'll see you in a bit.
- All right.
Pete!
Hi, Pete, are you all right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Well, you jumped, you lived.
That's a good start.
Yeah.
Maybe in another 40 or 50 years I'll try it again.
Pete!
Pete, Pete, Pete.
- Swoop!
- Hey, Pete, Pete.
- Listen, talk to these guys, okay?
- We want to help you.
Okay?
Tell them that my leg is broke, okay?
Anything you want, Swoop.
Anything you want, brother.
All right!
Let's do it!
- Hey, what's going on, man?
- I got that stuff, man.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Hey, you guys.
Hey, Buford.
Hey, Milady.
Come on.
Come on.
I've got breakfast for you.
Come over here.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Agnes!
Agnes, come on.
Hey, Buford.
Buford, look, look.
Look what I've got you for breakfast.
Help!
Help me!
Get over here.
Nothing personal, buddy.
You've got to be sick of those tired, two-month relationships.
Problem is, you're not meeting the right kind of woman.
A woman who'll run with the wolves, somebody who'll at least keep you interested.
- Run with the wolves?
- Yeah.
Man, I've told you about watching too much of that Oprah shit.
Come on, Pete.
A little excitement is not gonna kill you.
Terry, I like the women nice, quiet and dull.
You know what I'm saying?
Not like that Mongolian feminist that you set me up with.
Okay, wait a minute.
All right, who is it?
- Who is who?
- Who is she?
- What?
- Come on, come on, you know.
Every time we start talking about my sex life, it comes down to your wife trying to set me up with somebody.
- So, who is she?
- Hold on, hold on, hold on...
- This is your brother talking, G.
- Who is she, man?
What?
She, like, cook breakfast with her toes or something?
- What?
I got to wheel her around or...
- All right, all right, all right.
- Her name is Shanandra.
- Gesundheit.
No, no, come on, dude.
Her name is Shanandra, G.
What the hell is a Shanandra?
I don't know, but she's bad, I'll tell you that.
I am too old to be dating a Shanandra.
Something like...
Something that comes out your nose or something.
Trust me on this one, G.
Keep it up.
Got a job to do here.
Hey, Terry and Pete Nessip, United States Marshals.
May I have your ID, please?
Okay, sir.
Sign right here, please.
Shanandra, sounds like a nightclub.
Gordon Maples, United States Attorney's Office.
- Pete Nessip.
This is my brother Terry.
- Pete, Terry.
Remember when the DEA started electronically confiscating drug money
- from all the banks?
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Dealers started to wake up in the morning to find all their money gone.
So, this guy Leedy was the big computer wonk for the Chang Triad.
He figured out how to hide their money so we couldn't find it.
You mean that guy in there, coughing up furballs, is a genius?
He breaks codes that can't be broken.
It's like he lived inside the computers.
- How did he get caught?
- His ego.
He felt unappreciated, so I cut him a deal to testify and kept him out of sight for the last year and a half.
Now, two weeks from trial, they found him.
I need you guys to move Mr. Leedy up to the pen in Atlanta so I can keep him alive long enough to testify.
What about the cats?
We don't have to take the cats, too, do we?
welcome to Pac-Atlantic flight 611 to Atlanta with continuing service to Seattle.
Please make sure that all carry-on baggage is securely stowed...
Whoops!
It's okay.
That's what I'm here for, cat protection.
Cat protection.
Smooth, real smooth.
Okay, tight enough.
Are you sure you've fed the cats enough?
Agnes, she's got a little bit of a problem with low blood sugar.
Leedy, the cats will be better fed than we will on this plane.
You're not just saying that to make me feel better, are you?
- Now, why would I do that?
- What about the...
How can we make sure they can maintain the temperature in the baggage compartment?
What if they freeze?
I gotta get down and see the cats.
I want...
- Chill, man.
- What if they freeze?
Hey, excuse me.
- Would you like an aisle seat?
- That would be great.
Why are we not in first class?
We should be in first class.
The pleasure's all mine.
43 A and B. This is going to be great.
I'm warning you.
If anything happens to those cats, I'm gonna sue you.
You owe me, G.
You've ever heard of punitive damages, Mr. US Marshal?
We should be in first class, anyway.
- Miss, excuse me.
- Yes, sir.
I'm afraid to fly.
I need some water to take a sedative.
- Okay, no problem.
I'll be right with you.
- Doctor...
Okay, thanks.
we're getting some heavy weather, folks.
So I've got permission to climb to 38,000, see if we can get above it.
Bob, I think you'd better listen to this.
Pac-Air 611 Bravo, this is Miami Approach.
we just received a code-red transmission.
Would you care for some wine?
Thanks, but I only drink wine by candlelight.
Well, I might be able to help you with that.
Would you like to follow me?
Give me a break.
The captain needs to see you on the flight deck, right away.
Yeah.
- Gentlemen
- We just received this.
Flight 611, you are about to be taken over by Posse Comitus.
- Stay on your flight plan.
- Oh, brother.
No one will be hurt.
You'll receive further instructions in five minutes.
Over.
Hands up!
Okay!
Turn around, keep your head down.
I said keep your heads down!
Sit down.
Nobody move, God damn it.
If you do, I'll blow this plane to hell.
You understand?
Get off the phone.
You, too, God damn it.
Get down!
Get your heads down.
Feet on the floor.
Hands out of pockets.
You're not listening.
Both of you!
- Leedy, come with me.
- No, no, no!
No, don't do this.
No, please!
Please don't.
- How much time?
- Ten seconds.
Wait for now.
No, leave my hand.
No, that's my finger!
Jesus!
Be good now.
Be good boys and girls.
If you're not, I'll blow the plane up.
- what happened?
- Number 1 is down!
Talk to me!
Talk to me, Number 1.
I'm bulletproof. what are you?
Hey!
Help!
Now!
- What the hell?
- Shit!
We're losing cabin pressure.
Mayday!
Mayday!
This is Flight 611.
611 Heavy.
Declaring an emergency.
- We have emergency decompression.
...two and four.
We're over Ocala, in Florida.
We're...
Go!
Go!
I've got you.
Hang on.
Okay, hold on to me.
Hold on.
Okay.
Okay, hold on.
I've got you.
Grab her.
Hold her.
- Lena, hold on.
Hold on!
I've got her.
- Okay.
Okay.
Terry, hang on.
Hold on!
Help me!
Hang on, Terry.
- Help!
- Hold on.
I've got you.
Hold on.
Terry, you've gotta hold on!
I'm slipping!
- Terry!
- I won't let go of you!
- Hang on to me!
- No!
Don't...
Terry!
No!
No, Terry!
No.
- Glenn Blackstone, agent in charge, FBI.
- Bob Covington.
Tom McCracken, US Marshal's Office.
Listen, I'm looking for my guy, Pete Nessip.
- Supposed to...
- Pete's over there.
Pete.
Pete, did you see anything?
Two, three, maybe more.
You didn't hear anything?
Their names or anything?
The little girl, I reached for her and I grabbed her.
And...
They shot Terry.
Motherfuckers.
He was bad.
He was real bad.
The blood was everywhere and I...
He was falling.
I grabbed him and I had him.
- I couldn't hold him.
- Oh, my God.
I couldn't hold him.
Bring up the passenger list and seating assignment.
Okay, break down the ticket purchase into cash and credit card.
Cross-check that with advance purchase and same-day purchase.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- It's some kind of virus or worm, sir.
- Well, get it back.
I'm trying, but the whole system's going down.
- It's Leedy...
- What?
- It was a setup.
- A what?
- A setup.
- What are you saying, Nessip?
- A prison break at 30,000 feet?
- Yeah, why not?
So, what did they do?
Come down and pick him up in a goddamn spaceship?
Look, I tackled one of the guys.
He had some sort of pack on his back.
- Maybe it was a parachute.
- What about Leedy, now?
He jumps out, opens up an umbrella and floats down like Mary Poppins?
- Nobody saw a parachute.
- Nobody could see anything.
Their heads were down and the plane was filled with smoke.
What 32 people did see was they saw your brother fire at a man wrapped in explosives.
That's a lie!
Wait a minute, what is this?
The FBI get brownie points for speed?
We're talking about my brother here, man.
Look, isn't that worth the investigation?
- You want an investigation?
- Yes!
Two hours after the explosion, an airline maintenance man was gunned down at Miami airport running away from MPD detention.
And in his apartment they found Posse Comitus literature and homemade C-4 explosives.
The maintenance man put the explosives on board?
That's right.
Detective Fox, Miami PD, recognized the man from the pre-flight inspection.
I'm telling you...
Look, we all feel bad about what happened to your brother, and don't nobody want to paint him the fall guy.
But the fact of the matter is your brother opened fire on that plane and panicked, and 14 people are dead.
My brother didn't panic.
Sir, Forensics just got a positive ID on one of the remains found on the plane.
Your prisoner, Leedy.
Damn!
Through the coordinated investigation of federal, state and local law enforcement officials, the FBI believes that it has answered most of the questions concerning the attempted hijack of Pac-Atlantic Air Flight 611.
It was the Marshal on board who set off the explosion.
Is that true?
That question has been raised and is under investigation...
Hey, guys!
Guys, check it out!
- They're buying it top to bottom.
- Of course they're buying it.
Baby doll, you talk about a rush, man.
We went out that fucking door, that wind hit you like a goddamn freight train.
I'm dragging away from the jet,
I come face to face with this woman, and I swear, she was still holding a magazine.
Has Leedy finished throwing up?
- Yes.
- Good.
No, no, no, don't touch my hand, lady!
Don't!
No!
Don't touch my hand!
- Watch out!
Don't touch my hand!
- Earl, come here!
Don't touch my hand!
Shut up and say thank you.
- Thank you?
- Yes!
You threw me out of an airplane and you bit off my finger.
- You have nine good ones.
- Well, how am I supposed to do my work?
You crashed the entire airline computer system with one hand, didn't you?
The information we have is sketchy right now, but what we're hearing is that the Marshal allegedly fired at a hijacker, and according to passengers, set off the explosion which killed 14 people, including the hijackers.
Yes!
Unload the boat.
Unload the boat.
...and a federal prisoner by the name of Earl Leedy.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, they think I'm dead.
Does that mean I'm free?
You're not free.
Your ass belongs to me.
And I'm gonna make it worth your while.
But wait, he mentioned only two Marshals.
What about the other Marshal that was on the plane?
He's dead.
He's dead.
I shot him.
I don't think so.
He was in the bathroom.
Listen to me!
All he saw was smoke.
We got out clean, except for that bitch that grabbed you, Jagger.
Next time, you just get her and throw her out the door.
I'll buy you breakfast.
Come on, let's go.
Breakfast.
- What you got, Deuce?
- I got homemade grits and eggs.
How are you doing, Pete?
I need to talk to you.
It's important.
So is this.
Wait till you see what I found.
I got it nailed down to a two-square-mile radius where the hijackers could've landed.
We've got our bodies, Pete.
Yeah, but the only bodies we've got that are burned beyond recognition are those of the terrorists and that prick Leedy.
Does that make any sense?
Pete, nobody jumps from a 747 at that altitude and speed and lives.
- Period.
You understand that?
- No, no, no, that's where you're wrong.
Look, a SEAL team did it.
Jumped out of a 727 three years ago.
I'm telling you, it's a setup.
Now all I have to do is figure out how Leedy fits into all this.
What?
The Board of Review is looking at this in two weeks...
The Board of Review!
...to determine yours and Terry's responsibility for the accident.
- What responsibility?
- Pete, listen to me.
The FAA and the airline's in the middle of a goddamn firestorm with the media, the insurance companies, relatives of dead passengers...
Nobody wants to hear about skydiving.
Skydiving from 747s!
They're looking to point fingers at somebody, and you and Terry are it.
Don't you understand that?
You know the SOP on this.
I have to ask you for your badge and your gun.
- What?
You're suspending me?
- Pete, please, you know the rules.
Give me your badge and your gun, please.
I don't care.
I'm not quitting on this.
I took a team out in a commercial jet.
Delta Squad deployment, hostage-drill scenario.
- So it can be done?
- We did it.
But it was a 727 at 20,000 feet.
And it was a drill, no explosions.
A 747 at 38,000 feet, I doubt it.
Plus, you got another problem.
- Petty Officer.
- Yes, sir.
You see this?
You see this D-ring?
High-density metal.
Now, your terrorists may have had somebody stash a few guns behind a seat, but not five parachute rigs.
Five rigs going through X-ray and metal detectors would raise holy hell with airport security.
- Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.
So, with the right equipment, it is possible.
Mister, to even think about jumping from a 747 you've either got to be very skilled or dick-brained.
- Now, which one do you wanna talk to?
- What do you mean?
Well, skilled is a guy named Don Jagger.
World-champion skydiver.
Dick-brained is his old partner, Jess Crossman.
Where can I find them?
I don't think they jump together anymore, but Crossman lives real close to here.
- Jess Crossman?
- Not today, man.
- Do you know where I can find him?
- You must be with the class.
Check upstairs.
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem, dude.
Be right out.
Damn!
- What was that?
- Can you believe that?
Now you listen here to me.
I hope you're good at fixing toilets, because you're never, ever gonna fix another plane of mine.
I got my new chute in.
You want to take me up later?
I'll take your face off if you don't come and fix this plane right.
Where did you learn how to fix planes?
Mr. Goodwrench?
This isn't a waiting room, and the next load is booked.
Damn.
And I really wanted to get on that plane.
DEA, FBI or local?
Jess Crossman.
If you want to talk to me, you're either a skydiver or a cop.
And, well, you definitely don't look like any skydiver I have ever seen.
You know, cops, I don't like them.
Every time you've met one has been right after you've broken the law.
Yeah.
Did I go out of state without calling my parole officer?
Yes, I admit it.
But it was an emergency.
You're not here about a parole violation?
Have you heard about a hijacking of a 747?
Yeah.
Hear about it, how could I miss it?
What a major screwup!
What if it wasn't a screwup?
What if someone just wanted to make it look that way?
- Why?
- To grab a prisoner I was escorting.
A jump.
A jailbreak from a 747?
That's a cool idea.
No offense.
- Could you do it?
- What, am I a suspect?
Why do you ask?
Well, because people probably told you that Jessie Crossman was the only person skilled enough to jump from a 747.
Well, the actual phrase used was "dick-brained."
And I checked.
You were with your parole officer.
Look, some yahoo pulled a John Wayne on that flight and got a lot of people killed, all right?
That's not what happened, Ms. Crossman.
And that yahoo was my brother.
Well, God.
I'm sorry about that.
But if I'm not a suspect, then I don't have to talk to you, do I?
You still haven't answered the question about the jump.
See, the longer I stand here, the broker I get.
So...
You want to talk to me about jumping, you can pay like everyone else, right, Mr. Cop?
We'll see.
What do I need this getup for if I don't have a chute?
It's my drop zone, it's my rules.
Wait a minute, now.
You're not scared, are you?
No.
Hey, wait!
Hold on!
Wait for me!
All right, give me a controlled exit and a good arch.
Ready, set, go!
I don't get the attraction.
You know, haven't you ever watched a bird gliding on the wind
- and wished you could do it?
- Yeah, for about 20 seconds.
You know, you just don't get it, do you?
What could be so difficult about jumping out of an airplane?
You count to 20, you pull the damn string and that's it.
Let the air sculpt your body position, all right?
Ready, set, go!
- Yes!
- Jesus...
Can you see the way the wind forces the...
Come here.
Can you see the way the wind forces their bodies open?
We're only at 80 knots.
A 747 at 500 knots would rip a jumper clean apart.
And that, my friend, is where the skill comes in.
No big deal.
You are way out of your league up here, cowboy.
Way out.
I hear you talking all this stuff about skill.
If you're so good, how come you're still working in this shithole?
What?
What, you need to be hooked on phonics?
Shit hole.
Shithole.
Hey!
He paid for one jump, I might as well give him one.
For Christ's sake, just go get him, okay?
All right.
Help!
Get off of me!
Get off of me.
You kicked me.
Wait!
Come back!
Come back!
Come back!
- Help me!
- I've got you.
You're crazy!
- Hold still.
- Get me out of this.
I thought you did okay.
Welcome to the sky!
You fell, you lived, good start.
Now you fell, you lived, I'm gone.
You're out of your damn mind.
There are things in here.
Hey!
Hey, I didn't know she was going to do that, okay?
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah?
I bet it was a whole lot safer than landing with you in that damn plane of yours.
Where can I find Don Jagger?
There's a big jump this weekend at Ocean Reef.
All the hot ones will be there.
That's your best bet, man.
Thank you.
Skydivers are a real tight group.
You're gonna have a tough time breaking in by yourself.
Well, I'll take my chances, thank you very much.
Hey, you know, Jess didn't mean anything by that.
Ever since Jagger went south on her she's been a little touchy.
What happened to Jagger?
He says he got conned into making some drug jumps.
He did a little time.
She did a little time, too.
- They never patched things up.
- Why would she want to?
She's loyal.
I'd give her that much.
What do you think?
I think it's time for you to zip it.
And let's go on and get that rammerjammy fixed on the tail, all right?
- Nice jump, man.
- Yeah, right!
Shit!
I'll kill you.
Please, don't push me.
Don't let me...
Wait.
No, wait.
No!
- Nice landing.
- Good.
Good.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come on, come on, come on...
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- I can't.
I can't.
- Hit it, brother.
Hit it, brother.
Hit it.
- I can't, I'm sorry...
- Leedy, do your job.
I need a minute to steady myself.
When we break in, we don't have minutes, we have seconds.
- It's the jump.
Don't...
It's the jump.
- Now, do it.
- I can't think.
- Jump him until he can.
Maybe he's had enough for one day, all right?
I haven't had enough for one day.
Jump him till he can, come on.
- Please.
I can't think.
- Come on.
Up and at 'em.
- Go!
Come on!
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Up and at 'em.
Come on, let's go.
- I don't want to jump anymore!
- Come on, go!
This is going to be a snap.
God, this is easy.
They're not going to know what hit them.
- Hi, Joy Willins.
- I'm Pete.
- Pete.
Yeah.
- It's a pleasure.
Miami Police.
They've been really great.
Come on, Lena's around back.
Look what I've got for you.
Thank you.
That's to replace the one that you lost on the plane.
Maybe it'll make you feel a little better.
Lena, do you remember me?
Remember that your tiger bumped me upside the head when we were on the plane?
Do you remember anything about your plane trip?
Maybe that there was something strange happening, there was noise, yelling?
No, I fell asleep and when I woke up we were already landed.
I'm going to show you some pictures and I want you to look at them very carefully.
This is the plane that we were on.
Remember?
Remember the plane?
And then something went wrong.
Something happened.
There was a loud noise.
There was a lot of smoke.
- A big noise?
- A big noise.
There was a lot of wind and people were yelling and screaming.
Do you remember if you saw anyone?
Help me!
- What are you doing?
- Do you remember anything about what he may have been wearing or...
What?
He wore glasses?
He...
The scar.
He had a scar?
Lena, was this the man that you saw on the plane?
You can tell me, nobody's gonna hurt you.
Look, see, he has a scar.
Is this the man?
All right, okay.
Look, look.
That's enough, okay?
- That's enough.
Could you please go now?
- See, he has a scar.
- Was this the man you saw?
- Let's end it.
I'm gonna get the detectives.
- You can answer, it's okay.
- Detective Wallace!
- That's all right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Please.
- Thank you, Lena.
I'm sorry.
- Come on, it's all right.
That's all right.
Yes!
Detective Fox, Miami Metro.
Concerning that plane accident you're investigating.
The other US Marshal on the plane has acquired some information.
- The other Marshal?
- That's correct.
The young lady on the plane, she gave him a partial ID of one of the hijackers.
A scar under his right eye.
- I'm impressed.
- Thank you.
Not with you, with the other Marshal.
Hang on, I wanna come with you.
- Hey, Don.
- Hey.
You're mine now.
Where I go, you go.
Let me go or lose me forever.
I'm serious.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Hey.
Ty, what are you doing?
Hey, hey, let me go.
What are you doing?
Let me go!
Hey!
Hey!
Damn it!
Hey, God damn it!
Let me go!
Let me go!
You son of a bitch!
It's all over.
Bye-bye.
No!
Cool move, papa.
You see that?
9-1-1 is not gonna work for him.
What you just saw there can happen to any one of you.
Our skydiving team is now four strong.
No problems with that.
Oh, God.
Did you ever jump those round chutes?
You can't steer the damn things and you never know where they're gonna come down.
I got enough branches up my ass to start a pulpwood mill.
Hi.
I'd like...
I don't know, maybe...
A minute to wait for you to come back.
- Look at this guy.
- What's he doing at our table?
I don't think he gets it.
Let's explain it to him.
Yeah.
Here it goes.
This is going to get messy.
Hey, guys, I'm sitting in your seats?
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Can I offer you a beer?
- Sure.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Hey, hey, come on, man.
If you wanted me to move, you just should have asked.
Jesus!
Take it.
Get these guys a beer.
Get him a pillow.
- Nessip.
- Bob.
Nice to meet you, Bob.
See you up there.
Well, I see you've met some skydivers.
You're not much of a cop, but you sure do make friends easy.
If you blow my cover, I'm gonna bust your ass right back to prison.
Do you understand me?
Looks like you're doing a good job of blowing your own cover.
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Last time I did that, I got into a fight.
Look, buddy, at the moment we're the only cover you've got.
Have a seat.
Look, all I want to do is talk to your friend Jagger.
Okay, then here's what I want.
There's a big exhibition jump in DC next weekend.
I want to go, but my parole officer won't let me.
- Keep talking.
- Well, see, you got a big problem here.
The only way you're gonna learn anything is if you hang out with the best.
And right now, you're kind of sticking out like a Cub Scout in a whorehouse.
Bad news, man, you're not gonna believe what happened.
I reach your parole officer and you work me in with these guys, right?
And another thing...
Burn in.
Drinks up!
Blue skies!
- Black death!
- Black death!
What the hell is that?
It means some skydiver somewhere burned in today.
- What does that mean?
- As in, crash landed.
Dead.
They're gonna ring that bell and raise a toast every hour till midnight.
- Great tradition.
- Who hammered in?
Jagger.
Damn!
The cops found him with a fat sack of cocaine on him.
He was stuck up in some power lines.
Power lines?
What, he just floated into the power lines, Sel?
It's just what I heard.
I'm sorry.
- No, that's not possible.
- Jessie, I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
If you want my help, you pay for me and the airplane.
- Okay, how much?
- $15,000.
- $15,000?
- That's what it costs.
What do you care, anyway?
It's the government's money.
I don't work for the government anymore.
I'll talk to you later.
What's up, man?
- Good news.
Good news, Mr. Moncrief.
- What's that?
Our client has found your offer quite interesting.
We're all just a little concerned about the fact that you used to be an agent for the DEA.
Used to be.
Used to be is why I'm worth something to you.
Right, right, well your past leaves a bad taste in our client's mouth.
You have to do better than that.
If the taste was bad, gentlemen, you wouldn't be here.
What I'm offering you, no one else in the world can provide.
No one else.
I'm willing to prove it by doing it one time for free.
Then when we meet again, you tell your boss to bring his wallet.
Payment in full.
Simple as that.
Then we have a deal.
Thanks for lunch.
Let's go.
Go!
You're up.
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready!
Torski, these are computers.
- Silent movies for 400, please.
- Answer there...
Who is Jackie Cooper?
Coogan.
Jackie Coogan, stupid...
- We gotta go.
- Damn it.
Give me some space!
Hey, how are you doing?
I've got a surprise for you here.
My God.
Look at this.
Too bad we're not in the drug business.
- Come on, Leedy.
- I've almost got it.
- There.
- Where are you...
Can I help with anything?
You're making me nervous.
Would you just get away?
You got two minutes, Earl.
- What can I do to help you?
- I've got access.
Good.
Good.
- I'm into the system.
- Yes.
- Wanna run this up to the evidence locker?
- You got it, babe.
Hey, Judy, Judy, wait up.
Baby, don't come down here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey.
- The elevator's coming up.
- Roger that.
- Earl, we have to close that now.
- Okay!
Okay!
All right, okay.
Here they come.
Look at him.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
- We've got to go.
Close it down.
- Don't rush me.
They'll know we were here.
You did good.
Move it.
Stay.
Go!
Go!
- we're moving, Torski.
- Got you.
Oh, yeah.
God damn it!
Fucking Leedy threw up all over me.
The daring late-night theft netted criminals over $50,000 worth of drugs stolen from this protective enclosure.
The thieves hid out in the building's maintenance area until everyone had gone home.
An intensive Internal Affairs review is underway, since access to these areas is strictly limited to station personnel.
Reporting from Miami headquarters, I'm Diana Morales.
Back to you.
I have to admit it, you're good, but so am I.
Here come your Miami undercover agents.
Finally.
These narcs are walking around somewhere thinking they're alive.
Excellent.
Thank you, carry on.
So, is that it?
- Am I done?
- No, a little while longer.
Is this the Marshal, the other Marshal?
The one on the plane?
- You told me you took care of him.
- Don't worry about him.
What do you mean, don't worry about it?
The guy you killed is his brother.
Leedy!
I said don't worry about him.
I'll take care of my end of it, okay?
- Radical.
- All right, man, right behind you.
Yeah, I'm ready, man.
- Where's your car?
- Don't ask.
- Well, very, very cool bike.
- Air time.
Where's my team?
All right, all right, they're upstairs.
- All right.
- Come on.
Looking good, guys.
Good formation.
That's great.
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, Jess.
- How you doing?
- How you doing, baby?
I'm getting together a team for the DC jump.
What about it?
- Hell, yes.
Are you kidding me?
- Cool.
Have you seen Swoop around?
No, not for a while.
I heard that crazy bastard was living on the street, though.
Yeah, right.
What else is new?
I think I know where he's at.
We'll find him and Hockridge and we've got ourselves a team.
- I'm in.
Good to see you.
- All right.
Good to see you.
Jess, come here.
Hockridge is out, he busted his ankle.
- What?
- It wasn't even on a jump.
He slipped getting out of the bathtub.
But, you see, I figure I could take his place, no problem.
What have you logged, sweet pea, a whole 20 jumps?
Come on, Jess, when was the last time you actually saw me jump?
No, he is looking a lot better, Jess.
I've been giving him some extra air time.
- He's good.
- You give me half the chance,
- I'll slice the sky to pieces.
- Look, Selly, I don't need an Indiana Jones.
I need somebody who's good and who takes orders, period.
Well, I like the kid's attitude.
He's got a lot of enthusiasm.
I think he does, too, but enthusiasm can get you killed up there.
Thank you, Pete.
- I can get Burt, he'll be here next week.
- No, I can't deal with Burt.
Can I have your attention, please?
All right, Selly, you're in.
But here's the drill.
First of all, you're our mechanic, so please keep the plane flying.
Second of all, if you hotdog on me, you're gone.
And third, Winona, keep a watch on the extra air time.
Come on, let's go.
I'm taking Pete, we're gonna go find Swoop.
- Swoop?
He's a nutcase.
- Swoop is cool.
Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop you.
- I'm jumping, right?
- Jumping out of a plane?
No, I need you alive to deal with my probation officer.
- Come on, Jess, I'm serious.
- So am I. I'm a good teacher, but nobody's good enough to get you up to exhibition level in a week.
Jess, here's the deal.
Something tells me I'm not going to find who I'm looking for down here, right?
So, I gotta go up there.
If I don't jump, we've got no deal.
All right, you're an alternate, you train, but you don't jump the exhibition.
Way to go, kid.
- Swoop.
- Why are we up here, again?
Swoop!
What the hell would he be doing over there?
Swoop!
Over here.
- Hey, Swoop.
- Hey!
- What are you doing?
- Jeez.
How about this, huh?
The fine folks of this building asked if I'd just come out here and do a few windows, this and that.
- I need you for a team, Swoop.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
How much does it pay?
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
All your jumps are paid for.
So, how about those jumps, there, Jess, are they paid for?
- Yeah, they are.
- Didn't I just say that to him?
Yeah, but if he hasn't jumped with you, he won't talk to you.
He won't.
Well, I am going to have to require a free T-shirt, Jess.
- What?
Can we get him a free T-shirt?
- Yes.
Tell him he can have a T-shirt.
- Okay.
Free T, Swoop.
Whatever you want.
- Yeah!
- Swoop.
Yeah.
- My lucky day.
Here, give me a hand.
All right!
It opened.
That ain't funny.
That ain't funny, man.
Did you know about this?
Find what you're looking for?
- How long have you been following me?
- Ever since you decided to be my friend.
What's this all about?
When a skydiver burns in, the cops bring the rig to a safety officer for inspection.
- And this is Jagger's.
- And...
What?
There's nothing wrong with this rig.
Which means he would have had to screw up big time in order to float into those power lines.
And there's no way that happened.
He had help.
- Aren't these supposed to be metal?
- Yeah, it's a smuggler's rig.
- A what?
- It's a smuggler's rig.
Drug runners custom-make them out of high-density fabric to escape radar.
- There's no metal in them.
- Would these pass through airport security?
- Yeah, probably.
- Damn!
What?
Pete!
Put this back right where you found it, all right?
You listen to me, these people are killers.
You leave the cop stuff to me.
All right.
- Milton.
- Mike. wake up, Mike.
This is Nessip.
Pete.
What?
I got an envelope that I'm delivering to you with a piece of nylon in it.
I want you to examine it for explosives, all right?
Explosives?
Nylons?
Are you dating that Mongolian feminist again?
Look, I need your help on this, Mike.
I thought you were on suspension...
Vacation.
Suspension.
You can say it.
Yeah, I am.
That's why I need you to do this for me.
Just examine it for explosives, alloys, powder, whatever you can find.
Anything.
This is the Justice Department.
We don't have time for that.
Mike, just do it, okay?
All right.
And don't tell them it's for me, or else they'll fire your ass.
Why can't you just be calling to borrow money like usual, Pete?
Hey.
- Let's go.
- Go in.
Come on!
Get in there.
Yeah, watch this.
- He isn't balancing at all.
- Yeah.
See?
Beautiful!
- Watch it coming down.
- I love it.
Oh, yeah!
Crash and burn.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
I love it!
I love it!
What a ride!
What a ride!
Need for speed.
That was great!
That was great!
It was incredible!
How did I do?
Come on, what's with him?
I jumped with him.
What's the deal?
I don't think he counts what you just did as a jump.
He's kind of funny that way.
Well, what kind of other jump is there?
There's only one kind ofjump and I did a sweet one, if I must say.
My buddy, Luxem, ran the lab on your nylon.
This is serious guacamole.
Look at this.
He found C-4 explosive, flash-bang residue, high-grade alloys.
I mean, you ain't dealing with a cat burglar, Pete.
Yeah, but it means I'm in the right place.
Tell your friend I owe him one.
No need, I promised him you'd paint his house this summer.
The chopper's aboard.
Good to see you.
Hey, how you doing?
Good to see you again.
- How are you?
- Good to see you.
- Welcome.
Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.
- Follow me, please.
- We've tested your free sample and decided we want more.
There's only one way you're gonna get more.
Your price is rather large.
So are the results.
Good evening, everyone.
Welcome aboard.
I'm only interested in long-term investments.
What happens when the DEA replaces their dead agents?
And they will.
You're buying a very sophisticated data service.
Once we're in the DEA computer, we're in, and we'll update you whenever they do.
And the charge for this update?
$2 million a month for the operations and names of every undercover DEA agent in the world.
What can I say?
When do we see the list?
The day after Thomas Jefferson died, July 5th.
God bless America.
All right, settle down, everybody, settle down.
And welcome to DC.
Yeah!
The jump tomorrow is one you're gonna tell your grandchildren about.
We're jumping into the city's fireworks display and coming right down in Potomac Park.
That's right.
Everybody settle down.
That's right, a 34-way carousel dive.
Got Jack in the center surrounded by a nine-way star, outside of that, a 24-way star.
The judges today determine who gets to jump tomorrow, and who doesn't.
You wanna be in a big fireworks show, you'd better fly your butts off.
You need 10 points or better to qualify.
That's all I've got to say.
Let's load them up and skydive!
- Four hundred, 450.
Something like that.
- No.
- What kind of competition is that?
- A vicious competition, man.
Ten points I gotta get?
Hey, Swoop, how did you fix in with this group, man?
- It's a little embarrassing, isn't it?
- It's all right.
It's all right.
What are you, a comedian?
Why don't you fuck off?
Nice landing, man!
- You are bad!
- That's my man.
My chute!
- All right.
All right.
Okay.
- All right.
Okay, that's 10 points for Moncrief's team.
- That's 10 points for Crossman's team.
- Both teams qualify.
Hey, Torski, watch your butt!
Hey!
Hey!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Hey, get the hell out of my face, man.
- Hey!
Hey, you, you son of a bitch.
- Merry Christmas, asshole.
- Holy shit.
What's that guy doing?
- It looks like a gift wrap.
Rock and roll!
God damn it!
Get away from me.
Get away from me.
Son of a bitch!
Get away.
No, get the hell away from me!
Bunch of assholes!
High five.
- Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop!
- Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop!
Thank you.
- Who's the guy with Torski?
- Ty Moncrief.
He's military or something.
He shows up now and then for big jumps.
I got to go strangle the weasel.
You do that, Pete.
- That guy was right.
- We'll mess things up.
- Look who's here, Deucie.
- Knock yourself out, man.
- Mr. Comedian.
- We're just jumpers, here.
- What do you think you're doing, sport?
- Can't we all just...
You think it's funny?
You wanna play with me?
You son of a bitch.
How are you doing now, sport?
You wanna do this?
You want to play with me, son?
How do you like that?
Shit!
- Yeah, the toilet's stopped up, man.
- Yeah?
- Why don't you go use a tree?
- A tree?
- Yeah, right there, see?
- Okay.
That's okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm environmentally conscious.
Why don't you try this on for a while?
Hey, man, none of this is any of your business, unless you want me to make it such, so why don't you get out of here?
You fuck with my team, you fuck with me.
Hey, fuck you and fuck your team.
I look out for everyone.
Come on.
Come on.
Swoop.
Swoop.
Watch your head.
Come on.
What?
So, what about this Ty Moncrief?
Jagger did a couple of drug carries for them three years ago.
Thanks.
Is he good enough to be one of the people I'm looking for?
If I find out that he killed Jagger, it won't matter how good he is.
Well, why would he risk showing his face around here?
I mean, what's so special about this DC jump?
Well, the 4th-of-July exhibition, Pete, it's the biggest thing in the world.
I mean, Washington, DC is a drop zone.
Any other day, it's the most restricted air space.
That's why every skydiver worth his ass wants in on this load.
- Where exactly are they putting down?
- Sel, pass me that map.
Please.
Thank you.
It's right there, right by the Washington Monument.
You mean a jumper could put down anyplace he wanted to?
I myself am going to make a landing right in Abe Lincoln's lap.
Jess, you tell the new guy, "Thanks."
Thanks.
Yeah, tell him, "Anytime." I enjoyed it.
- Can I keep this?
- Sure.
All right, see you, guys.
That's him.
That's what I've been trying to tell you all along.
- I know.
I know.
- And I'm telling you, we'd better take this son of a bitch out
- before he shuts us down.
- Shut up.
Shut up.
This is real simple.
Cops can smell dead cops 100 miles away.
We keep their team on the ground, they'll never touch us.
- I see.
So how do you plan on doing that?
- By taking out their leader.
Crossman.
This is Jessie's trailer.
Not much longer, man, we've gotta move.
Have a nice trip.
Patrick, get this off to Chicago and wait for the fax.
It's number six.
Tom.
- Holy shit.
What the hell happened to you?
- I've got to talk to you.
Come on in here.
Patrick, let me know when that comes in.
Working undercover while on suspension violates your sworn oath.
Not to mention 20 different laws.
- Me accessing his file makes it 21.
- I'm in the middle of them.
As a matter of fact, I found one of the chutes from the 747.
- Did you know that?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
If you've got evidence, make your case to the FBI.
You're going to have to do better than this Ty Moncrief fellow.
He's DEA.
See that?
- Moncrief is DEA?
- Honorably discharged eight months ago.
I'll bring his service record up so you can see it.
What the hell's going on with this computer?
Leedy.
Peter.
Pete!
Okay, folks, check it out.
Demo jumpers, we've got about a 12-minute call to dress rehearsal.
Twelve-minute call.
Let's nail this one, puppies.
we've gotta nail this one.
- Guys, has anyone seen Nessip?
- Who?
No.
Pete.
No.
What's your problem, ace?
What's the matter, sweet pea?
Nothing, I mean, I'm not the pro here,
I don't want to be the one to screw things up.
Sel, you're not going to screw anything up.
Listen to me.
This rig, it logged two world titles for Jagger and one for me, all right?
You wanna wear this?
This mean I don't have to wear that stupid helmet?
Sel, no, you don't gotta wear the stupid helmet.
How's that, all right?
- Yeah!
Let's jump!
- The star!
- I'm ready.
- Hold on, hotdog.
- Time to go.
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's get out there.
- Do it!
Shit.
Somebody didn't open.
Selkirk, cut away.
Damn it.
Cut away.
I can't get it.
Cut away.
4,000 feet.
Swoop, get him.
God damn.
- Two grand.
Pull it!
- Pull it!
- Pull it.
- Pull it.
Come on, pull.
Come on.
Paramedics to the water area now!
We need a medic over here.
- God, what happened to him?
- It's not good.
Sel, can you hear us?
Please.
God damn it, get this off him.
- Stay with us, Selly.
- Oh, Bobby, he's not breathing.
- He's not breathing.
- He tried to pull it, it just wouldn't work.
- God.
Get up!
- Here we go.
Get us a medic, God damn it.
Stay with us, Selly.
- I hear it.
I hear it.
- Yeah!
Yeah!
Selkirk, buddy.
- He's breathing.
He's breathing.
- There you go.
- He's breathing.
- Look out, let me in here.
- Look out.
You all right?
- He's breathing.
Okay.
Good job.
Good job.
- You're going to be okay.
- You're gonna be okay, buddy.
- Can you hear me?
- It's okay.
- Sel.
- Take it easy.
- We're right here, buddy.
- Sorry, guys, but you can't stay in here.
We're going to stay right here with you, buddy, all right?
You can meet us at the hospital, but nobody rides in the van.
- Bullshit, we're family.
- Nobody.
Hey, guys, don't worry about it, right?
You guys have gotta jump anyway.
Get the hell out of here.
Just tell Jess her rig's broken.
All right, man, we'll see you at the hospital.
Where the hell is Jessie?
Winona, let's get this plane in the air.
We're going after Ty's plane.
- Who's this?
- I'm a US Marshal.
Now, you can read about it later.
No way, later.
We're going.
Come on.
Crank it up.
- I want to jump!
- Okay, let's go.
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go!
Bye-bye.
Let's go.
Chutes on.
Let's go.
Here we go.
We're so close to pulling this off.
All you have to do...
Hey, surprise!
Only one of you really has to die.
So tell me, who killed Jagger?
How about me?
You wanna try me?
You come here, I'll shoot you right in between the fucking eyes!
Jesus, Jessie, bad idea...
You look like a little boy without a chute, Jessie.
- I knew it was you, Ty.
- Stay there.
You don't know what you're doing.
No.
You don't know what the fuck you're doing.
Let me tell you about Jagger.
He betrayed you.
He left you in prison to rot like jailbait.
This is his girlfriend.
You meant nothing to him.
He's dead.
You're on the wrong...
Sit down.
Get off of me.
- Get off.
- Throw her out.
Throw her out.
Jump.
Jump, Jessie, I dare you.
- Oh, shit.
- Jess.
- She's got a lot ofjuice.
- Yeah, but she ain't got no wings, man.
Let's go, get our chutes on.
We've lost them.
They sure as hell weren't tracking for the fireworks.
I know where Ty's headed.
He's going to the DEA building.
Right near the drop zone.
- Should I radio for backup?
- Yeah, right.
First they'll laugh at you, then they'll throw your ass in jail.
Jesus, Mary, priest!
Jessie.
She's hanging on the footrail.
What the hell is she doing?
I know exactly what she's doing.
It's the only trick I know.
- Swoop, what are you doing?
- I'm not going to miss this.
...reveals nothing.
I suggest his mind has been so conditioned as part of a preconceived plan.
God damn, look at this dweeb.
You think by the 23rd century they'd have better toupees than that.
- They all wear wigs on that show.
- Not Spock.
- He got the ears.
- What the hell are you talking about?
All clear up here.
I'm going to the 19th floor.
Little power hit.
Probably burning down the kitchen again.
Joanne, are you cooking again?
we've had a couple power spikes.
No, you guys want to order a pizza?
I'm starving.
All right, we're in.
- Radio check.
- One.
- Two.
- Three.
Clear.
Not now.
There is no logic in Thelev's attack upon the Captain.
There is no logic...
Okay.
- Is it going to work?
- It's going to work.
Come on, come on, come on.
Go, go, go, go, go.
- Leedy.
Earl.
Earl!
- Leedy, quickly.
Where are you?
Come on.
- We're all clear.
- Good.
Okay, we're into the game.
Come on.
How smart can one man be?
Jimmy Sansome, Jesus Christ, that guy used to hit on me.
This guy's a Fed?
- Deuce, run code blue.
Are you ready?
- Yeah, copy, Ty.
I'm ready to rock and roll.
It's cool up here.
The chutes are ready.
- What the...
- Look out!
What's the matter, you can't fly?
Swoop, get away from the door.
Follow me.
Come on, get him up.
You're dead, dead.
Thank God!
Listen up.
Stage 1 is completed.
Stay focused, we're right on schedule.
Yeah.
Well, the schedule's gonna change.
- Come on.
Are you okay?
- There you go.
- Swoop, stay here.
Don't rob him, okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
Okay, okay.
- I'm going for help.
- Okay, easy, take it easy.
Easy.
She's going for help.
What the hell?
Joanne, come back to me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got you.
Joanne, we've got a circuit trip, says a washer trolley is moving.
Check it out, will you?
Hi, we might be under attack from Klingons.
Maybe they got food.
Okay, I'm on my way.
I'll be back.
Ty, the elevator's moving.
Stop it on this floor.
I'm coming to meet you.
Stay with Leedy.
Hey!
Quiet, quiet, quiet.
Give him the gun, give him the gun.
It's okay, don't panic.
Why don't you radio down and tell them everything's fine, you're okay?
Tell them you're fine.
Nothing going on up here.
We're still getting a washer-trolley signal, though.
- Probably just a short.
- Roger.
Yeah, thank you.
You're dismissed.
You take care of her.
I'm letting them know.
Oh, my God!
- Fuck!
- What?
Whoa!
God damn it!
You go up on the roof.
Kara, check the floor.
I'm coming with Leedy.
I'm with the magician.
You're on the roof.
I need you.
Come on, come on, let's go.
- All right, Leedy, I'm right outside.
- What?
Where are you going?
Hey!
Shit!
I'm calling for backup.
Call the fire department, too.
We got smoke on the 20th floor.
Right.
Close it out.
Close it out.
Now!
- Ty...
- You little...
God damn it.
Kara.
- Are you proud of yourself?
- Ty, get off me.
Come on.
Come on, go, go.
I'll be right back, okay?
Okay, I'll be right nearby.
- Right nearby, okay?
- All right.
All right.
Jessie?
Jessie, what do you want me to do?
Jessie...
- Leedy, don't you move.
- What?
Wait, wait.
No, wait, wait.
- Don't move.
- You got them.
You got them.
You've got them on hijacking, murder, smuggling, kidnapping, cruelty to animals.
Look what they did to me.
They took my finger...
Thought you'd get away from me, huh?
Earl.
Earl, you disappoint me.
They're going to put you away if you go in.
Who's your friend?
Look, I was just trying to stall them for you.
You're the reason your little brother's dead, you idiot.
Families shouldn't fly together.
That's all right, you'll meet him again.
I guarantee that.
And when you do, he's gonna bust your ass.
You try and stop me, or bring me somewhere, you're fucked!
He's bluffing, Jessie.
He needs this little bastard.
Don't you think about it!
Shoot him, shoot him dead!
Freeze!
Drop your weapons.
I said drop them!
Leedy?
Leedy!
Shit!
I'm going for it.
Oh, Jesus.
Look, guys, is this really necessary?
I'm not that hurt.
You know, I've been through worse than this before.
I will personally write the President and recommend that you receive commendation for your actions.
Now, if you'll just maintain your stations here, and secure this location,
I'll be checking the rest of the area.
- Jerry.
- Dupont, Ted.
- Yes, very good work.
- With a "J."
Leedy.
Leedy.
Leedy, you come back here.
Leedy.
Leedy.
Stop that guy.
Stop.
The one with the bozo hairdo.
Leedy.
Jesus, listen to me.
Listen to me.
He's wearing a DEA jacket.
Stop...
Leedy, you come...
Leedy!
Leedy!
Stop that guy.
No way.
Don't make me roll after you.
You better not make me roll after you.
Yeah, that guy right there.
He's one of the bad guys.
Fucking awesome, man.
Way to go, Swoop!
Hey, man, it's the other leg, man.
- All right, I'll see you in a bit.
- All right.
Pete!
Hi, Pete, are you all right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Well, you jumped, you lived.
That's a good start.
Yeah.
Maybe in another 40 or 50 years I'll try it again.
Pete!
Pete, Pete, Pete.
- Swoop!
- Hey, Pete, Pete.
- Listen, talk to these guys, okay?
- We want to help you.
Okay?
Tell them that my leg is broke, okay?
Anything you want, Swoop.
Anything you want, brother.
All right!
Let's do it!
(PRISONERS CHATTERING)
- Hey, what's going on, man?
- I got that stuff, man.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Hey, you guys.
Hey, Buford.
Hey, Milady.
Come on.
Come on.
I've got breakfast for you.
Come over here.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Agnes!
Agnes, come on.
(MOUSE SQUEAKING)
(UPBEAT LATIN MUSIC PLAYING)
Hey, Buford.
Buford, look, look.
Look what I've got you for breakfast.
(LEEDY EXCLAIMING)
LEEDY:
Help!
Help me!
Get over here.
(LEEDY EXCLAIMING)
Nothing personal, buddy.
(TERRY LAUGHING)
TERRY:
You've got to be sick of those tired, two-month relationships.
Problem is, you're not meeting the right kind of woman.
A woman who'll run with the wolves, somebody who'll at least keep you interested.
- Run with the wolves?
- Yeah.
Man, I've told you about watching too much of that Oprah shit.
(TERRY LAUGHING)
TERRY:
Come on, Pete.
A little excitement is not gonna kill you.
PETE:
Terry, I like the women nice, quiet and dull.
You know what I'm saying?
Not like that Mongolian feminist that you set me up with.
Okay, wait a minute.
All right, who is it?
- Who is who?
- Who is she?
- What?
- Come on, come on, you know.
Every time we start talking about my sex life, it comes down to your wife trying to set me up with somebody.
- So, who is she?
- Hold on, hold on, hold on...
- This is your brother talking, G.
- Who is she, man?
What?
She, like, cook breakfast with her toes or something?
- What?
I got to wheel her around or...
- All right, all right, all right.
- Her name is Shanandra.
- Gesundheit.
No, no, come on, dude.
Her name is Shanandra, G.
PETE:
What the hell is a Shanandra?
TERRY:
I don't know, but she's bad, I'll tell you that.
PETE:
I am too old to be dating a Shanandra.
Something like...
Something that comes out your nose or something.
TERRY:
Trust me on this one, G.
(KEYBOARD CLACKING)
GUARD:
Keep it up.
Got a job to do here.
Hey, Terry and Pete Nessip, United States Marshals.
May I have your ID, please?
Okay, sir.
Sign right here, please.
(BUZZER SOUNDING)
Shanandra, sounds like a nightclub.
Gordon Maples, United States Attorney's Office.
- Pete Nessip.
This is my brother Terry.
- Pete, Terry.
Remember when the DEA started electronically confiscating drug money
- from all the banks?
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Dealers started to wake up in the morning to find all their money gone.
So, this guy Leedy was the big computer wonk for the Chang Triad.
He figured out how to hide their money so we couldn't find it.
TERRY:
You mean that guy in there, coughing up furballs, is a genius?
He breaks codes that can't be broken.
It's like he lived inside the computers.
- How did he get caught?
- His ego.
He felt unappreciated, so I cut him a deal to testify and kept him out of sight for the last year and a half.
Now, two weeks from trial, they found him.
I need you guys to move Mr. Leedy up to the pen in Atlanta so I can keep him alive long enough to testify.
What about the cats?
We don't have to take the cats, too, do we?
(CAT MEWING)
FLIGHT ATTENDANT ON PA:
Welcome to Pac-Atlantic flight 611 to Atlanta with continuing service to Seattle.
Please make sure that all carry-on baggage is securely stowed...
Whoops!
It's okay.
That's what I'm here for, cat protection.
Cat protection.
Oh, smooth, real smooth.
Okay, tight enough.
Are you sure you've fed the cats enough?
Agnes, she's got a little bit of a problem with low blood sugar.
Leedy, the cats will be better fed than we will on this plane.
You're not just saying that to make me feel better, are you?
- Now, why would I do that?
- What about the...
How can we make sure they can maintain the temperature in the baggage compartment?
What if they freeze?
I gotta get down and see the cats.
I want...
- Chill, man.
- What if they freeze?
Hey, excuse me.
- Would you like an aisle seat?
- That would be great.
LEEDY:
Why are we not in first class?
We should be in first class.
The pleasure's all mine.
MAN: 43 A and B. This is going to be great.
LEEDY:
I'm warning you.
If anything happens to those cats, I'm gonna sue you.
TERRY:
You owe me, G.
You've ever heard of punitive damages, Mr. US Marshal?
We should be in first class, anyway.
- Miss, excuse me.
- Yes, sir.
I'm afraid to fly.
I need some water to take a sedative.
- Okay, no problem.
I'll be right with you.
- Doctor...
Okay, thanks.
(SNORING)
(BABY CRYING)
PILOT ON PA:
We're getting some heavy weather, folks.
So I've got permission to climb to 38,000, see if we can get above it.
Bob, I think you'd better listen to this.
MAN ON RADIO:
Pac-Air 611 Bravo, this is Miami Approach.
We just received a code-red transmission.
Would you care for some wine?
Thanks, but I only drink wine by candlelight.
Well, I might be able to help you with that.
Would you like to follow me?
Mmm-hmm.
Give me a break.
The captain needs to see you on the flight deck, right away.
Yeah.
- Gentlemen
- We just received this.
MAN ON RADIO:
Flight 611, you are about to be taken over by Posse Comitus.
- Stay on your flight plan.
- Oh, brother.
MAN ON RADIO:
No one will be hurt.
You'll receive further instructions in five minutes.
Over.
Hands up!
Okay!
Turn around, keep your head down.
I said keep your heads down!
(PASSENGERS EXCLAIMING)
Sit down.
Nobody move, God damn it.
If you do, I'll blow this plane to hell.
You understand?
(PHONE BEEPING)
Get off the phone.
(PASSENGERS SCREAMING)
You, too, God damn it.
Get down!
Get your heads down.
Feet on the floor.
Hands out of pockets.
You're not listening.
Both of you!
- Leedy, come with me.
- No, no, no!
No, don't do this.
No, please!
Please don't.
- How much time?
- Ten seconds.
MONCRIEF:
Wait for now.
No, leave my hand.
No, that's my finger!
(CRYING)
Jesus!
Be good now.
Be good boys and girls.
If you're not, I'll blow the plane up.
- What happened?
- Number 1 is down!
Talk to me!
Talk to me, Number 1.
I'm bulletproof.
What are you?
Hey!
Help!
Now!
- What the hell?
- Shit!
We're losing cabin pressure.
(CONSOLES BEEPING)
Mayday!
Mayday!
This is Flight 611.
611 Heavy.
Declaring an emergency.
- We have emergency decompression.
- ... two and four.
We're over Ocala, in Florida.
We're...
(PASSENGERS SCREAMING)
(PASSENGERS SCREAMING)
Go!
Go!
(BOTH SCREAMING)
I've got you.
Hang on.
Okay, hold on to me.
Hold on.
Okay.
(GRUNTING)
Okay, hold on.
I've got you.
Grab her.
Hold her.
MRS. WILLINS:
Lena, hold on.
Hold on!
I've got her.
Okay.
Okay.
(SCREAMING)
Terry, hang on.
Hold on!
Help me!
Hang on, Terry.
- Help!
- Hold on.
MRS. WILLINS:
I've got you.
Hold on.
Terry, you've gotta hold on!
I'm slipping!
- Terry!
- I won't let go of you!
- Hang on to me!
- No!
Don't...
Terry!
No!
Terry!
No!
No, Terry!
No.
- Glenn Blackstone, agent in charge, fbi.
- Bob Covington.
Tom McCracken, US Marshal's Office.
Listen, I'm looking for my guy, Pete Nessip.
- Supposed to...
- Pete's over there.
Pete.
Pete, did you see anything?
Two, three, maybe more.
You didn't hear anything?
Their names or anything?
The little girl, I reached for her and I grabbed her.
And...
They shot Terry.
Motherfuckers.
He was bad.
He was real bad.
The blood was everywhere and I...
He was falling.
I grabbed him and I had him.
- I couldn't hold him.
- Oh, my God.
I couldn't hold him.
BLACKSTONE:
Bring up the passenger list and seating assignment.
Okay, break down the ticket purchase into cash and credit card.
Cross-check that with advance purchase and same-day purchase.
(BEEPING)
- What are you doing?
- WOMAN:
Nothing.
- It's some kind of virus or worm, sir.
- Well, get it back.
I'm trying, but the whole system's going down.
- It's Leedy...
- COVINGTON:
What?
- It was a setup.
- A what?
- A setup.
- What are you saying, Nessip?
- A prison break at 30,000 feet?
- Yeah, why not?
So, what did they do?
Come down and pick him up in a goddamn spaceship?
Look, I tackled one of the guys.
He had some sort of pack on his back.
- Maybe it was a parachute.
- BLACKSTONE:
What about Leedy, now?
He jumps out, opens up an umbrella and floats down like Mary Poppins?
- Nobody saw a parachute.
- Nobody could see anything.
Their heads were down and the plane was filled with smoke.
What 32 people did see was they saw your brother fire at a man wrapped in explosives.
That's a lie!
Wait a minute, what is this?
The fbi get brownie points for speed?
We're talking about my brother here, man.
Look, isn't that worth the investigation?
- You want an investigation?
- Yes!
Two hours after the explosion, an airline maintenance man was gunned down at Miami airport running away from MPD detention.
And in his apartment they found Posse Comitus literature and homemade C-4 explosives.
The maintenance man put the explosives on board?
That's right.
Detective Fox, Miami PD, recognized the man from the pre-flight inspection.
I'm telling you...
Look, we all feel bad about what happened to your brother, and don't nobody want to paint him the fall guy.
But the fact of the matter is your brother opened fire on that plane and panicked, and 14 people are dead.
My brother didn't panic.
Sir, Forensics just got a positive ID on one of the remains found on the plane.
Your prisoner, Leedy.
Damn!
Through the coordinated investigation of federal, state and local law enforcement officials, the fbi believes that it has answered most of the questions concerning the attempted hijack of Pac-Atlantic Air Flight 611.
REPORTER:
It was the Marshal on board who set off the explosion.
Is that true?
That question has been raised and is under investigation...
Hey, guys!
Guys, check it out!
- They're buying it top to bottom.
- Of course they're buying it.
Baby doll, you talk about a rush, man.
We went out that fucking door, that wind hit you like a goddamn freight train.
I'm dragging away from the jet,
I come face to face with this woman, and I swear, she was still holding a magazine.
Has Leedy finished throwing up?
- Yes.
- Good.
(EXCLAIMING)
No, no, no, don't touch my hand, lady!
Don't!
No!
Don't touch my hand!
- Watch out!
Don't touch my hand!
- Earl, come here!
Don't touch my hand!
Shut up and say thank you.
- Thank you?
- Yes!
You threw me out of an airplane and you bit off my finger.
- You have nine good ones.
- Well, how am I supposed to do my work?
You crashed the entire airline computer system with one hand, didn't you?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
REPORTER:
The information we have is sketchy right now, but what we're hearing is that the marshal allegedly fired at a hijacker, and according to passengers, set off the explosion which killed 14 people, including the hijackers.
(ALL CHEERING)
Yes!
Unload the boat.
Unload the boat.
...and a federal prisoner by the name of Earl Leedy.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, they think I'm dead.
Does that mean I'm free?
You're not free.
Your ass belongs to me.
And I'm gonna make it worth your while.
But wait, he mentioned only two Marshals.
What about the other Marshal that was on the plane?
He's dead.
He's dead.
I shot him.
I don't think so.
He was in the bathroom.
Listen to me!
All he saw was smoke.
We got out clean, except for that bitch that grabbed you, Jagger.
Next time, you just get her and throw her out the door.
I'll buy you breakfast.
Come on, let's go.
Breakfast.
- What you got, Deuce?
- I got homemade grits and eggs.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
How are you doing, Pete?
I need to talk to you.
It's important.
PETE:
So is this.
Wait till you see what I found.
I got it nailed down to a two-square-mile radius where the hijackers could've landed.
We've got our bodies, Pete.
Yeah, but the only bodies we've got that are burned beyond recognition are those of the terrorists and that prick Leedy.
Does that make any sense?
Pete, nobody jumps from a 747 at that altitude and speed and lives.
- Period.
You understand that?
- No, no, no, that's where you're wrong.
Look, a SEAL team did it.
Jumped out of a 727 three years ago.
I'm telling you, it's a setup.
Now all I have to do is figure out how Leedy fits into all this.
What?
The Board of Review is looking at this in two weeks...
The Board of Review!
...to determine yours and Terry's responsibility for the accident.
- What responsibility?
- Pete, listen to me.
The FAA and the airline's in the middle of a goddamn firestorm with the media, the insurance companies, relatives of dead passengers...
Nobody wants to hear about skydiving.
Skydiving from 747s!
They're looking to point fingers at somebody, and you and Terry are it.
Don't you understand that?
You know the SOP on this.
I have to ask you for your badge and your gun.
- What?
You're suspending me?
- Pete, please, you know the rules.
Give me your badge and your gun, please.
I don't care.
I'm not quitting on this.
MAN:
I took a team out in a commercial jet.
Delta Squad deployment, hostage-drill scenario.
- So it can be done?
- We did it.
But it was a 727 at 20,000 feet.
And it was a drill, no explosions.
A 747 at 38,000 feet, I doubt it.
Plus, you got another problem.
- Petty Officer.
- Yes, sir.
You see this?
You see this D-ring?
High-density metal.
Now, your terrorists may have had somebody stash a few guns behind a seat, but not five parachute rigs.
Five rigs going through X-ray and metal detectors would raise holy hell with airport security.
- Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.
So, with the right equipment, it is possible.
Mister, to even think about jumping from a 747 you've either got to be very skilled or dick-brained.
- Now, which one do you wanna talk to?
- What do you mean?
Well, skilled is a guy named Don Jagger.
World-champion skydiver.
Dick-brained is his old partner, Jess Crossman.
Where can I find them?
I don't think they jump together anymore, but Crossman lives real close to here.
- Jess Crossman?
- Not today, man.
- Do you know where I can find him?
- Oh, you must be with the class.
Check upstairs.
- Thanks a lot.
- No problem, dude.
JESSIE:
Be right out.
(ENGINE FALTERING)
(ENGINE BACKFIRING)
(BRAKES SQUEALING)
Damn!
- What was that?
- Can you believe that?
Now you listen here to me.
I hope you're good at fixing toilets, because you're never, ever gonna fix another plane of mine.
I got my new chute in.
You want to take me up later?
I'll take your face off if you don't come and fix this plane right.
Where did you learn how to fix planes?
Mr. Goodwrench?
(SIGHS)
This isn't a waiting room, and the next load is booked.
Damn.
And I really wanted to get on that plane.
DEA, fbi or local?
Jess Crossman.
If you want to talk to me, you're either a skydiver or a cop.
And, well, you definitely don't look like any skydiver I have ever seen.
You know, cops, I don't like them.
Every time you've met one has been right after you've broken the law.
Yeah.
Did I go out of state without calling my parole officer?
Yes, I admit it.
But it was an emergency.
Uh-huh.
You're not here about a parole violation?
Have you heard about a hijacking of a 747?
Yeah.
Hear about it, how could I miss it?
What a major screwup!
What if it wasn't a screwup?
What if someone just wanted to make it look that way?
- Why?
- To grab a prisoner I was escorting.
A jump.
A jailbreak from a 747?
That's a cool idea.
No offense.
- Could you do it?
- What, am I a suspect?
Why do you ask?
Well, because people probably told you that Jessie Crossman was the only person skilled enough to jump from a 747.
Well, the actual phrase used was "dick-brained. "
And I checked.
You were with your parole officer.
Look, some yahoo pulled a John Wayne on that flight and got a lot of people killed, all right?
That's not what happened, Ms. Crossman.
And that yahoo was my brother.
Well, God.
I'm sorry about that.
But if I'm not a suspect, then I don't have to talk to you, do I?
You still haven't answered the question about the jump.
See, the longer I stand here, the broker I get.
So...
You want to talk to me about jumping, you can pay like everyone else, right, Mr. Cop?
We'll see.
What do I need this getup for if I don't have a chute?
It's my drop zone, it's my rules.
Wait a minute, now.
You're not scared, are you?
No.
Hey, wait!
Hold on!
Wait for me!
(EXCLAIMING)
JESSIE:
All right, give me a controlled exit and a good arch.
Ready, set, go!
(SCREAMING)
I don't get the attraction.
You know, haven't you ever watched a bird gliding on the wind
- and wished you could do it?
- Yeah, for about 20 seconds.
You know, you just don't get it, do you?
What could be so difficult about jumping out of an airplane?
You count to 20, you pull the damn string and that's it.
Let the air sculpt your body position, all right?
Ready, set, go!
(WHOOPING)
- JESSIE:
Yes!
- Jesus...
Can you see the way the wind forces the...
Come here.
Can you see the way the wind forces their bodies open?
We're only at 80 knots.
A 747 at 500 knots would rip a jumper clean apart.
And that, my friend, is where the skill comes in.
No big deal.
You are way out of your league up here, cowboy.
Way out.
I hear you talking all this stuff about skill.
If you're so good, how come you're still working in this shithole?
What?
What, you need to be hooked on phonics?
Shit hole.
Shithole.
Hey!
(YELLING)
(CROSSMAN LAUGHING)
He paid for one jump, I might as well give him one.
For Christ's sake, just go get him, okay?
All right.
(SCREAMING)
Help!
Help!
PETE:
Get off of me!
Get off of me.
You kicked me.
Wait!
Come back!
Come back!
Come back!
- Help me!
- I've got you.
You're crazy!
(CROSSMAN LAUGHS)
(CROSSMAN WHOOPING)
(PETE GROANING)
- Hold still.
- Get me out of this.
I thought you did okay.
Welcome to the sky!
You fell, you lived, good start.
Now you fell, you lived, I'm gone.
You're out of your damn mind.
There are things in here.
(LAUGHING)
WINONA:
Hey!
Hey, I didn't know she was going to do that, okay?
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah?
I bet it was a whole lot safer than landing with you in that damn plane of yours.
Where can I find Don Jagger?
There's a big jump this weekend at Ocean Reef.
All the hot ones will be there.
That's your best bet, man.
Thank you.
Skydivers are a real tight group.
You're gonna have a tough time breaking in by yourself.
Well, I'll take my chances, thank you very much.
Hey, you know, Jess didn't mean anything by that.
Ever since Jagger went south on her she's been a little touchy.
What happened to Jagger?
He says he got conned into making some drug jumps.
He did a little time.
She did a little time, too.
- They never patched things up.
- Why would she want to?
She's loyal.
I'd give her that much.
What do you think?
I think it's time for you to zip it.
And let's go on and get that rammerjammy fixed on the tail, all right?
- Nice jump, man.
- Yeah, right!
(GROANING)
Shit!
Shit!
I'll kill you.
LEEDY:
Please, don't push me.
Don't let me...
Wait.
No, wait.
No!
(SCREAMING)
- Oh, nice landing.
- Good.
Good.
(SHOUTING)
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Come on, come on, come on...
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
- I can't.
I can't.
- Hit it, brother.
Hit it, brother.
Hit it.
- I can't, I'm sorry...
- Leedy, do your job.
I need a minute to steady myself.
When we break in, we don't have minutes, we have seconds.
- It's the jump.
Don't...
It's the jump.
- Now, do it.
- I can't think.
- Jump him until he can.
Maybe he's had enough for one day, all right?
I haven't had enough for one day.
Jump him till he can, come on.
- Please.
I can't think.
- Come on.
Up and at 'em.
- Go!
Come on!
Let's go.
- Let's go.
Up and at 'em.
Come on, let's go.
LEEDY:
I don't want to jump anymore!
JAGGER:
Come on, go!
This is going to be a snap.
God, this is easy.
They're not going to know what hit them.

- Hi, Joy Willins.
- I'm Pete.
- Pete.
Yeah.
- It's a pleasure.
Miami Police.
They've been really great.
Come on, Lena's around back.
Look what I've got for you.
Thank you.
PETE:
That's to replace the one that you lost on the plane.
Maybe it'll make you feel a little better.
Lena, do you remember me?
Remember that your tiger bumped me upside the head when we were on the plane?
Do you remember anything about your plane trip?
Maybe that there was something strange happening, there was noise, yelling?
No, I fell asleep and when I woke up we were already landed.
I'm going to show you some pictures and I want you to look at them very carefully.
This is the plane that we were on.
Remember?
Remember the plane?
And then something went wrong.
Something happened.
There was a loud noise.
There was a lot of smoke.
- (STAMMERING) A big noise?
- A big noise.
There was a lot of wind and people were yelling and screaming.
Do you remember if you saw anyone?
Help me!
Help me!
- (STAMMERING) What are you doing?
- Do you remember anything about what he may have been wearing or...
What?
He wore glasses?
He...
The scar.
He had a scar?
Lena, was this the man that you saw on the plane?
You can tell me, nobody's gonna hurt you.
Look, see, he has a scar.
(SCREAMING)
PETE:
Is this the man?
All right, okay.
Look, look.
That's enough, okay?
- That's enough.
Could you please go now?
- PETE:
See, he has a scar.
- Was this the man you saw?
- Let's end it.
I'm gonna get the detectives.
- You can answer, it's okay.
- Detective Wallace!
- That's all right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Please.
- Thank you, Lena.
I'm sorry.
- Come on, it's all right.
That's all right.
Yes!
Detective Fox, Miami Metro.
Concerning that plane accident you're investigating.
The other US Marshal on the plane has acquired some information.
- The other Marshal?
- FOX:
That's correct.
The young lady on the plane, she gave him a partial ID of one of the hijackers.
A scar under his right eye.
MONCRIEF:
Oh, I'm impressed.
FOX:
Thank you.
Not with you, with the other Marshal.
(WHISTLES)
Hang on, I wanna come with you.

I'm serious.

Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Hey.

Hey, hey, let me go.
What are you doing?
Let me go!
Hey!

It's all over.
Bye-bye.
No!

Cool move, papa.
You see that?
9-1-1 is not gonna work for him.
What you just saw there can happen to any one of you.
Our skydiving team is now four strong.
No problems with that.
(RHYTHMIC MUSIC PLAYING)
POOL PLAYER:
Oh, God.
Did you ever jump those round chutes?
You can't steer the damn things and you never know where they're gonna come down.
I got enough branches up my ass to start a pulpwood mill.
Hi.
I'd like...
I don't know, maybe...
A minute to wait for you to come back.
- Look at this guy.
- MAN:
What's he doing at our table?
I don't think he gets it.
Let's explain it to him.
(LAUGHING) Yeah.
Oh, here it goes.
This is going to get messy.
Hey, guys, oh, I'm sitting in your seats?
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Can I offer you a beer?
- Sure.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
PETE:
Hey, hey, come on, man.
If you wanted me to move, you just should have asked.
(GRUNTING)
Whoa!
Jesus!
Take it.
Get these guys a beer.
Get him a pillow.
- Nessip.
- Bob.
Nice to meet you, Bob.
See you up there.
(LAUGHING)
Well, I see you've met some skydivers.
You're not much of a cop, but you sure do make friends easy.
If you blow my cover, I'm gonna bust your ass right back to prison.
Do you understand me?
Looks like you're doing a good job of blowing your own cover.
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Last time I did that, I got into a fight.
Look, buddy, at the moment we're the only cover you've got.
Have a seat.
Look, all I want to do is talk to your friend Jagger.
Okay, then here's what I want.
There's a big exhibition jump in DC next weekend.
I want to go, but my parole officer won't let me.
- Keep talking.
- Well, see, you got a big problem here.
The only way you're gonna learn anything is if you hang out with the best.
And right now, you're kind of sticking out like a Cub Scout in a whorehouse.
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)
Bad news, man, you're not gonna believe what happened.
I reach your parole officer and you work me in with these guys, right?
Oh, and another thing... (BELL CLANGING)
Burn in.
Drinks up!
Blue skies!
- Black death!
- Black death!
What the hell is that?
It means some skydiver somewhere burned in today.
- What does that mean?
- As in, crash landed.
Dead.
They're gonna ring that bell and raise a toast every hour till midnight.
- Great tradition.
- Who hammered in?
Jagger.
Damn!
The cops found him with a fat sack of cocaine on him.
He was stuck up in some power lines.
Power lines?
What, he just floated into the power lines, Sel?
It's just what I heard.
I'm sorry.
- No, that's not possible.
- Jessie, I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
If you want my help, you pay for me and the airplane.
- Okay, how much?
- $15,000.
- $15,000?
- That's what it costs.
What do you care, anyway?
It's the government's money.
I don't work for the government anymore.
I'll talk to you later.
What's up, man?
(EXHALING)
(SQUAWKING)
- Good news.
Good news, Mr. Moncrief.
- What's that?
Our client has found your offer quite interesting.
We're all just a little concerned about the fact that you used to be an agent for the DEA.
Used to be.
Used to be is why I'm worth something to you.
Right, right, well your past leaves a bad taste in our client's mouth.
You have to do better than that.
If the taste was bad, gentlemen, you wouldn't be here.
(LAUGHING)
What I'm offering you, no one else in the world can provide.
No one else.
I'm willing to prove it by doing it one time for free.
Then when we meet again, you tell your boss to bring his wallet.
Payment in full.
Simple as that.
Then we have a deal.
Thanks for lunch.
Let's go.
Go!
You're up.
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready.

You're making me nervous.
Would you just get away?
You got two minutes, Earl.
- What can I do to help you?
- Shh!
I've got access.
Good.

I have to admit it, you're good, but so am I.

Excellent.
Thank you, carry on.

Is this the Marshal, the other Marshal?
The one on the plane?

You told me you took care of him.

What do you mean, don't worry about it?

Good formation.
That's great.

- Hey, Jess.
- How you doing?
- How you doing, baby?
I'm getting together a team for the DC jump.
What about it?
- Hell, yes.
Are you kidding me?
- Cool.
Have you seen Swoop around?
No, not for a while.
I heard that crazy bastard was living on the street, though.
(LAUGHING) Yeah, right.
What else is new?
I think I know where he's at.
We'll find him and Hockridge and we've got ourselves a team.
- I'm in.
Good to see you.
- All right.
Good to see you.
Jess, come here.
Hockridge is out, he busted his ankle.
- What?
- It wasn't even on a jump.
He slipped getting out of the bathtub.
But, you see, I figure I could take his place, no problem.
What have you logged, sweet pea, a whole 20 jumps?
Come on, Jess, when was the last time you actually saw me jump?
No, he is looking a lot better, Jess.
I've been giving him some extra air time.
- He's good.
- You give me half the chance,
- I'll slice the sky to pieces.
- Look, Selly, I don't need an Indiana Jones.
I need somebody who's good and who takes orders, period.
Well, I like the kid's attitude.
He's got a lot of enthusiasm.
I think he does, too, but enthusiasm can get you killed up there.
Thank you, Pete.
- I can get Burt, he'll be here next week.
- No, I can't deal with Burt.
MAN ON PA:
Can I have your attention, please?
All right, Selly, you're in.
But here's the drill.
First of all, you're our mechanic, so please keep the plane flying.
Second of all, if you hotdog on me, you're gone.
And third, Winona, keep a watch on the extra air time.
Come on, let's go.
I'm taking Pete, we're gonna go find Swoop.
- Swoop?
He's a nutcase.
- Swoop is cool.
Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop you.
- PETE:
I'm jumping, right?
- Jumping out of a plane?
No, I need you alive to deal with my probation officer.
- Come on, Jess, I'm serious.
- So am I. I'm a good teacher, but nobody's good enough to get you up to exhibition level in a week.
Jess, here's the deal.
Something tells me I'm not going to find who I'm looking for down here, right?
So, I gotta go up there.
If I don't jump, we've got no deal.
All right, you're an alternate, you train, but you don't jump the exhibition.
Way to go, kid.
JESSIE:
Swoop.
PETE:
Why are we up here, again?
JESSIE:
Swoop!

SWOOP:
Over here.
- Hey, Swoop.
- Hey!
- What are you doing?
- PETE:
Jeez.
How about this, huh?
The fine folks of this building asked if I'd just come out here and do a few windows, this and that.
(LAUGHING)
- I need you for a team, Swoop.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
How much does it pay?
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
All your jumps are paid for.
So, how about those jumps, there, Jess, are they paid for?
- Yeah, they are.
- Didn't I just say that to him?
Yeah, but if he hasn't jumped with you, he won't talk to you.
He won't.
Well, I am going to have to require a free T-shirt, Jess.
- What?
Can we get him a free T-shirt?
- Yes.
Tell him he can have a T-shirt.
- Okay.
Free T, Swoop.
Whatever you want.
- Yeah!
- Swoop.
Yeah.
- My lucky day.
Here, give me a hand.

Did you know about this?
(WHISTLING)
PETE:
Find what you're looking for?
- How long have you been following me?
- Ever since you decided to be my friend.
What's this all about?
When a skydiver burns in, the cops bring the rig to a safety officer for inspection.
- And this is Jagger's.
- And...
What?
There's nothing wrong with this rig.
Which means he would have had to screw up big time in order to float into those power lines.
And there's no way that happened.
He had help.
PETE:
Aren't these supposed to be metal?
JESSIE:
Yeah, it's a smuggler's rig.
- A what?
- It's a smuggler's rig.
Drug runners custom-make them out of high-density fabric to escape radar.
- There's no metal in them.
- Would these pass through airport security?
- JESSIE:
Yeah, probably.
- Damn!
What?
Pete!
Put this back right where you found it, all right?
You listen to me, these people are killers.
You leave the cop stuff to me.
All right.
(PHONE RINGING)
- Milton.
- PETE:
Mike.
Wake up, Mike.
This is Nessip.
Pete.
What?
I got an envelope that I'm delivering to you with a piece of nylon in it.
I want you to examine it for explosives, all right?
Explosives?
Nylons?
Are you dating that Mongolian feminist again?
(IMITATING LAUGHTER)
Look, I need your help on this, Mike.
I thought you were on suspension...
Vacation.
PETE:
Suspension.
You can say it.
Yeah, I am.
That's why I need you to do this for me.
Just examine it for explosives, alloys, powder, whatever you can find.
Anything.
This is the Justice Department.
We don't have time for that.
Mike, just do it, okay?
All right.
And don't tell them it's for me, or else they'll fire your ass.
Why can't you just be calling to borrow money like usual, Pete?
Hey.
- Let's go.
- Go in.
(WHISTLING)
(MIMICKING FEAR)
MAN:
Come on!
Get in there.
(WHOOPING)
Yeah, watch this.
(EXCLAIMS)
- He isn't balancing at all.
- Yeah.
(LAUGHING)
See?
(ALL SCREAMING)
(WHOOPS)
(WHOOPING)
Beautiful!
(EXCLAIMING IN DELIGHT)
- BOBBY:
Watch it coming down.
- I love it.
Oh, yeah!
Crash and burn.
(WHOOPING)
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
I love it!
I love it!
What a ride!
What a ride!
Need for speed.
(WHOOPING)
That was great!
That was great!
It was incredible!
How did I do?
Come on, what's with him?
I jumped with him.
What's the deal?
I don't think he counts what you just did as a jump.
He's kind of funny that way.
Well, what kind of other jump is there?
There's only one kind ofjump and I did a sweet one, if I must say.
MILTON:
My buddy, Luxem, ran the lab on your nylon.
This is serious guacamole.
Look at this.
He found C-4 explosive, flash-bang residue, high-grade alloys.
I mean, you ain't dealing with a cat burglar, Pete.
Yeah, but it means I'm in the right place.
Tell your friend I owe him one.
No need, I promised him you'd paint his house this summer.
The chopper's aboard.
Good to see you.
Hey, how you doing?
Good to see you again.
- How are you?
- Good to see you.
- Welcome.
Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.
- Follow me, please.
- We've tested your free sample and decided we want more.
There's only one way you're gonna get more.
Your price is rather large.
So are the results.
Good evening, everyone.
Welcome aboard.
I'm only interested in long-term investments.
What happens when the DEA replaces their dead agents?
And they will.
You're buying a very sophisticated data service.
Once we're in the DEA computer, we're in, and we'll update you whenever they do.
And the charge for this update?
$2 million a month for the operations and names of every undercover DEA agent in the world.
What can I say?
When do we see the list?
The day after Thomas Jefferson died, July 5th.
God bless America.
ANNOUNCER:
All right, settle down, everybody, settle down.
And welcome to DC.
ALL:
Yeah!
(ALL CHEERING)
The jump tomorrow is one you're gonna tell your grandchildren about.
We're jumping into the city's fireworks display and coming right down in Potomac Park.
(CHEERING)
That's right.
Everybody settle down.
That's right, a 34-way carousel dive.
Got Jack in the center surrounded by a nine-way star, outside of that, a 24-way star.
The judges today determine who gets to jump tomorrow, and who doesn't.
You wanna be in a big fireworks show, you'd better fly your butts off.
You need 10 points or better to qualify.
That's all I've got to say.
Let's load them up and skydive!
SWOOP:
Four hundred, 450.
Something like that.
SELKIRK:
No.
- What kind of competition is that?
- SWOOP:
A vicious competition, man.
Ten points I gotta get?
Hey, Swoop, how did you fix in with this group, man?
- It's a little embarrassing, isn't it?
- It's all right.
It's all right.
What are you, a comedian?
Why don't you fuck off?
(EXCLAIMING)
Nice landing, man!
- You are bad!
- That's my man.
My chute!
- All right.
All right.
Okay.
- All right.
(CHEERING)
Okay, that's 10 points for Moncrief's team.
- That's 10 points for Crossman's team.
- Both teams qualify.
(SWOOP HOWLING)
Hey, Torski, watch your butt!
Hey!
Hey!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Hey, get the hell out of my face, man.
- Hey!
Hey, you, you son of a bitch.
- Merry Christmas, asshole.
- Holy shit.
What's that guy doing?
- ANNOUNCER:
It looks like a gift wrap.
Rock and roll!
(WHOOPING)
TORSKl:
God damn it!
TORSKl:
Get away from me.
Get away from me.
(CHEERING)
Son of a bitch!
Get away.
No, get the hell away from me!
Bunch of assholes!
High five.
ALL: (CHANTING) Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop!
Swoop!
(WHISTLING)
Thank you.
- Who's the guy with Torski?
- JESSIE:
Ty Moncrief.
He's military or something.
He shows up now and then for big jumps.
I got to go strangle the weasel.
You do that, Pete.
- That guy was right.
- We'll mess things up.
- Look who's here, Deucie.
- Knock yourself out, man.
- Mr. Comedian.
- We're just jumpers, here.
- What do you think you're doing, sport?
- Can't we all just...
You think it's funny?
You wanna play with me?
You son of a bitch.
(GRUNTING)
How are you doing now, sport?
You wanna do this?
You want to play with me, son?
How do you like that?
Shit!
- Yeah, the toilet's stopped up, man.
- Yeah?
- Why don't you go use a tree?
- A tree?
- Yeah, right there, see?
- Okay.
That's okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm environmentally conscious.
Why don't you try this on for a while?
Hey, man, none of this is any of your business, unless you want me to make it such, so why don't you get out of here?
You fuck with my team, you fuck with me.
Hey, fuck you and fuck your team.
I look out for everyone.
Come on.
Come on.
Swoop.
Swoop.
Watch your head.
Come on.
What?
Ow.
PETE:
So, what about this Ty Moncrief?
Jagger did a couple of drug carries for them three years ago.
Thanks.
Is he good enough to be one of the people I'm looking for?
If I find out that he killed Jagger, it won't matter how good he is.
Well, why would he risk showing his face around here?
I mean, what's so special about this DC jump?
Well, the 4th-of-July exhibition, Pete, it's the biggest thing in the world.
I mean, Washington, DC is a drop zone.
Any other day, it's the most restricted air space.
That's why every skydiver worth his ass wants in on this load.
- Where exactly are they putting down?
- Sel, pass me that map.
Please.
Thank you.
It's right there, right by the Washington Monument.
PETE:
You mean a jumper could put down anyplace he wanted to?
I myself am going to make a landing right in Abe Lincoln's lap.
Jess, you tell the new guy, "Thanks. "
Thanks.
Yeah, tell him, "Anytime. " I enjoyed it.
- Can I keep this?
- Sure.
All right, see you, guys.
That's him.
That's what I've been trying to tell you all along.
- I know.
I know.
- And I'm telling you, we'd better take this son of a bitch out
- before he shuts us down.
- Shut up.
Shut up.
This is real simple.
Cops can smell dead cops 100 miles away.
We keep their team on the ground, they'll never touch us.
- I see.
So how do you plan on doing that?
- By taking out their leader.
Crossman.
This is Jessie's trailer.
Not much longer, man, we've gotta move.
Have a nice trip.
Patrick, get this off to Chicago and wait for the fax.
It's number six.
PETE:
Tom.
- Holy shit.
What the hell happened to you?
- I've got to talk to you.
Come on in here.
Patrick, let me know when that comes in.
Working undercover while on suspension violates your sworn oath.
Not to mention 20 different laws.
- Me accessing his file makes it 21.
- I'm in the middle of them.
As a matter of fact, I found one of the chutes from the 747.
- Did you know that?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
If you've got evidence, make your case to the fbi.
You're going to have to do better than this Ty Moncrief fellow.
He's DEA.
See that?
- Moncrief is DEA?
- Honorably discharged eight months ago.
I'll bring his service record up so you can see it.
What the hell's going on with this computer?
Leedy.
Peter.
Pete!
ANNOUNCER:
Okay, folks, check it out.
Demo jumpers, we've got about a 12-minute call to dress rehearsal.
Twelve-minute call.
Let's nail this one, puppies.
We've gotta nail this one.
- Guys, has anyone seen Nessip?
- Who?
No.
Pete.
No.
What's your problem, ace?
What's the matter, sweet pea?
Nothing, I mean, I'm not the pro here,
I don't want to be the one to screw things up.
Sel, you're not going to screw anything up.
Listen to me.
This rig, it logged two world titles for Jagger and one for me, all right?
You wanna wear this?
This mean I don't have to wear that stupid helmet?
Sel, no, you don't gotta wear the stupid helmet.
How's that, all right?
(WHOOPING)
- Yeah!
Let's jump!
- The star!
(WHOOPING)
- I'm ready.
- Hold on, hotdog.
- Time to go.
- SWOOP:
Come on, let's go.
BOBBY:
Let's get out there.
JESSIE:
Do it!
(ALL WHOOPING)
Shit.
Somebody didn't open.
Selkirk, cut away.
Damn it.
Cut away.
I can't get it.
Cut away.
4,000 feet.
Swoop, get him.
God damn.
- Two grand.
Pull it!
- Pull it!
- Pull it.
- Pull it.
Come on, pull.
Come on.
(SELKIRK SCREAMING)
Paramedics to the water area now!
(SIREN WAILING)
We need a medic over here.
- God, what happened to him?
- It's not good.
Sel, can you hear us?
Please.
God damn it, get this off him.
- Stay with us, Selly.
- JESSIE:
Oh, Bobby, he's not breathing.
He's not breathing.
SWOOP:
He tried to pull it, it just wouldn't work.
JESSIE:
God.
Get up!
SWOOP:
Here we go.
BOBBY:
Get us a medic, God damn it.
Stay with us, Selly.
- I hear it.
I hear it.
SWOOP:
Yeah!
Yeah!
Selkirk, buddy.
- He's breathing.
He's breathing.
- There you go.
- He's breathing.
- PARAMEDIC:
Look out, let me in here.
- Look out.
You all right?
- He's breathing.
SWOOP:
Okay.
Good job.
Good job.
(COUGHING)
(SELKIRK COUGHING)
- PARAMEDIC:
You're going to be okay.
- You're gonna be okay, buddy.
- PARAMEDIC:
Can you hear me?
- It's okay.
- Sel.
- Take it easy.
- We're right here, buddy.
- Sorry, guys, but you can't stay in here.
We're going to stay right here with you, buddy, all right?
You can meet us at the hospital, but nobody rides in the van.
- Bullshit, we're family.
- Nobody.
Hey, guys, don't worry about it, right?
You guys have gotta jump anyway.
Get the hell out of here.
Just tell Jess her rig's broken.
All right, man, we'll see you at the hospital.
Where the hell is Jessie?
Winona, let's get this plane in the air.
We're going after Ty's plane.
- Who's this?
- I'm a US Marshal.
Now, you can read about it later.
No way, later.
We're going.
Come on.
Crank it up.
- MAN:
I want to jump!
- Okay, let's go.
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go!
Bye-bye.
Let's go.
Chutes on.
Let's go.
Here we go.
(FIREWORKS EXPLODING)
(SPECTATORS EXCLAIMING)
We're so close to pulling this off.
All you have to do...
Hey, surprise!
Only one of you really has to die.
So tell me, who killed Jagger?
How about me?
You wanna try me?
You come here, I'll shoot you right in between the fucking eyes!
Jesus, Jessie, bad idea...
You look like a little boy without a chute, Jessie.
(MONCRIEF LAUGHING)
- I knew it was you, Ty.
- Stay there.
You don't know what you're doing.
No.
You don't know what the fuck you're doing.
Let me tell you about Jagger.
He betrayed you.
He left you in prison to rot like jailbait.
This is his girlfriend.
You meant nothing to him.
He's dead.
You're on the wrong...
Sit down.
Get off of me.
- Get off.
- Throw her out.
Throw her out.
MONCRIEF:
Jump.
Jump, Jessie, I dare you.
- Oh, shit.
- Jess.
(GASPING)
- She's got a lot ofjuice.
- Yeah, but she ain't got no wings, man.
MONCRIEF:
Let's go, get our chutes on.
We've lost them.
They sure as hell weren't tracking for the fireworks.
I know where Ty's headed.
He's going to the DEA building.
Right near the drop zone.
- Should I radio for backup?
- Yeah, right.
First they'll laugh at you, then they'll throw your ass in jail.
Jesus, Mary, priest!
Jessie.
BOBBY:
She's hanging on the footrail.
What the hell is she doing?
I know exactly what she's doing.
It's the only trick I know.
- BOBBY:
Swoop, what are you doing?
- I'm not going to miss this.
(SIGHING)
(WHOOPS)
SPOCK ON TV:... reveals nothing.
I suggest his mind has been so conditioned as part of a preconceived plan.
GUARD:
God damn, look at this dweeb.
You think by the 23rd century they'd have better toupees than that.
- They all wear wigs on that show.
- Not Spock.
- He got the ears.
- What the hell are you talking about?
All clear up here.
I'm going to the 19th floor.
(CRACKLING)
GUARD:
Little power hit.
Probably burning down the kitchen again.
Joanne, are you cooking again?
We've had a couple power spikes.
No, you guys want to order a pizza?
I'm starving.
All right, we're in.
MONCRIEF:
Radio check.
One.
DEPUTY DOG:
Two.
LENA:
Three.
DEPUTY DOG:
Clear.
SPOCK ON TV:
Not now.
There is no logic in Thelev's attack upon the Captain.
There is no logic...
Okay.
(HISSING)
- Is it going to work?
- It's going to work.
Come on, come on, come on.
(BEEPING)
Go, go, go, go, go.
- Leedy.
Earl.
Earl!
- Leedy, quickly.
Where are you?
Come on.
(GRUNTING)
- We're all clear.
- Good.
Okay, we're into the game.
Come on.
How smart can one man be?
Jimmy Sansome, Jesus Christ, that guy used to hit on me.
This guy's a Fed?
- Deuce, run code blue.
Are you ready?
- Yeah, copy, Ty.
I'm ready to rock and roll.
(EXCLAIMING)
It's cool up here.
The chutes are ready.
- What the...
- Look out!
(SCREAMING)
What's the matter, you can't fly?
Swoop, get away from the door.
Follow me.
Come on, get him up.
You're dead, dead.
Oh, thank God!
MONCRIEF:
Listen up.
Stage 1 is completed.
Stay focused, we're right on schedule.
Yeah.
Well, the schedule's gonna change.
- Come on.
Are you okay?
- There you go.
- Swoop, stay here.
Don't rob him, okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
Okay, okay.
- I'm going for help.
- Okay, easy, take it easy.
Easy.
She's going for help.
GUARD:
What the hell?
Joanne, come back to me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got you.
GUARD:
Joanne, we've got a circuit trip, says a washer trolley is moving.
Check it out, will you?
(WITH SCOTTISH ACCENT) Hi, we might be under attack from Klingons.
Maybe they got food.
Okay, I'm on my way.
I'll be back.
Ty, the elevator's moving.
Stop it on this floor.
I'm coming to meet you.
Stay with Leedy.
Hey!
(WHISPERING) Quiet, quiet, quiet.
Give him the gun, give him the gun.
It's okay, don't panic.
Why don't you radio down and tell them everything's fine, you're okay?
Tell them you're fine.
Nothing going on up here.
We're still getting a washer-trolley signal, though.
- Probably just a short.
- Roger.
Yeah, thank you.
You're dismissed.
You take care of her.
I'm letting them know.
Oh, my God!
- Oh, fuck!
- MONCRIEF:
What?
Whoa!
God damn it!
You go up on the roof.
Kara, check the floor.
I'm coming with Leedy.
I'm with the magician.
You're on the roof.
I need you.
Come on, come on, let's go.
- All right, Leedy, I'm right outside.
- What?
Where are you going?
Hey!
(YELLING)
Shit!
I'm calling for backup.
Call the fire department, too.
We got smoke on the 20th floor.
Right.
Close it out.
Close it out.
Now!
(SCREAMING)
(CACKLING)
- Ty...
- You little...
God damn it.
Kara.
- Are you proud of yourself?
- Ty, get off me.
Come on.
Come on, go, go.
I'll be right back, okay?
Okay, I'll be right nearby.
- Right nearby, okay?
- All right.
All right.
Jessie?
Jessie, what do you want me to do?
Jessie...
- Leedy, don't you move.
- What?
Wait, wait.
No, wait, wait.
- Don't move.
- You got them.
You got them.
You've got them on hijacking, murder, smuggling, kidnapping, cruelty to animals.
Look what they did to me.
They took my finger...
Ow!
Thought you'd get away from me, huh?
Earl.
Earl, you disappoint me.
They're going to put you away if you go in.
Who's your friend?
Look, I was just trying to stall them for you.
You're the reason your little brother's dead, you idiot.
Families shouldn't fly together.
That's all right, you'll meet him again.
I guarantee that.
And when you do, he's gonna bust your ass.
You try and stop me, or bring me somewhere, you're fucked!
He's bluffing, Jessie.
He needs this little bastard.
Don't you think about it!
LEEDY:
Shoot him, shoot him dead!
Freeze!
Drop your weapons.
I said drop them!
(GUN FIRING)
Leedy?
Leedy!
(POLICE SIRENS WAILING)
Oh, shit!
(EXCLAIMING)
(GUN CLICKS)
(GUN CLICKS)
I'm going for it.
(MONCRIEF SCREAMING)
(SCREAMING)
Oh, Jesus.
Look, guys, is this really necessary?
I'm not that hurt.
You know, I've been through worse than this before.
LEEDY:
I will personally write the President and recommend that you receive commendation for your actions.
Now, if you'll just maintain your stations here, and secure this location,
I'll be checking the rest of the area.
- Jerry.
- Dupont, Ted.
- Yes, very good work.
- With a "J."
Leedy.
Leedy.
Leedy, you come back here.
Leedy.
Leedy.
Stop that guy.
Stop.
The one with the bozo hairdo.
Leedy.
Jesus, listen to me.
Listen to me.
He's wearing a DEA jacket.
Stop...
Leedy, you come...
Leedy!
Leedy!
Stop that guy.
(LAUGHING) No way.
Don't make me roll after you.
You better not make me roll after you.
Yeah, that guy right there.
He's one of the bad guys.
(EXCLAIMING)
(GRUNTING)
Fucking awesome, man.
(SIGHS)
Way to go, Swoop!
Hey, man, it's the other leg, man.
JESSIE:
All right, I'll see you in a bit.
BOBBY:
All right.
Pete!
Hi, Pete, are you all right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Well, you jumped, you lived.
That's a good start.
Yeah.
Maybe in another 40 or 50 years I'll try it again.
Pete!
Pete, Pete, Pete.
- Swoop!
- Hey, Pete, Pete.
- Listen, talk to these guys, okay?
- We want to help you.
Okay?
Tell them that my leg is broke, okay?
Anything you want, Swoop.
Anything you want, brother.
LOVE STORIES my grandmother tells
Hello!
Oh, well Jack wait a second I take my...
Ed its Jack
But Dana.
Yeah we are doing a movie here, We've got all this machinery.
Yeah.
I have your caviar.
Why don't we have that?
It's a special occasion.
I see.
Did you wake up... did they call you or did you call them?
Oh, I see.
They called you this morning, oh I see.
Ok.
My childhood began in the horse and buggy days.
This period changed abruptly with the outbreak of World War I in 1914.
Page 7.
Father proposed to my mother taking her for a ride in the carriage.
The Batner family at first were taken aback.
For those days when you asked for the ladies hand in marriage this was done in the parlour.
Over a period of three years, electricity, telephones, phonographs, cars and airplanes all appeared on the scene.
They played Caruso records and had many long conversations.
Of course, they were the most beautiful records and they're still using that voice, you know.
There was just no voice like Caruso... even Pavarotti.
That was the first record and the only record we had.
"I would like special people to stay on." said Krishnamurti.
"Gustav Regler and Peggy and eight others."
and we said "We are going to India."
It was then that he asked us to come to Madras.
Cause we said, we are going around the world.
And then of course we didn't get there because Gustav died, in New Delhi.
You know everybody burns up the body on the Ganges.
But then they throw the ashes in the river, it's a sacred river.
You walk and go to the boat down the river, you see everybody sitting there burning mimosa.
- Rather interesting, beside.
- Right.
They still do that everybody in India, all the time.
We came home for lunch, to the Pavlant's and Keenie's house.
And Gustav said, he wanted to sit in the garden and write, and I said, I'll take the little walk around the Elodie tombs.
Then he run upstairs to get a pencil.
And he fell on the staircase.
And wether He hit his head and had a haemorrhage, or he hadva haemorrhage and fell
We don't know.
So I had to come back and they pushed him in an old black Mariah to a field where you get... get a piece of cement as big as that rug.
And then you look around you give a man 50 cents or something, said we need wood to build a fire.
So the man brings the wood.
And then he finally dumps the body on top of it.
And he said the law is that you light the fire, nearest of kin.
And they said, we better put some grease on it because it's hard for him to burn.
So I covered him with grease.
And then this sister we'd been to came, and she brought petals, flower petals.
So instead of being absolutely naked poor little Gustav... she covered him with flower petals which was very nice, I thought.
"She covered him with flower petals."
I wanted to jump into the fire too because you know... many places in India the wives all jump in the fire.
The next day I went into a state of shock.
I was coming back in the driveway and the little man had came by on a bicycle.
It was something in a piece of newspaper.
He said, "Could you deliver this in the house?"
And I said, yes.
So I called Keenie and I said... there is something came in a newspaper for you.
And she opened it and it was Gustav's ashes.
Gustav was the big thing in my life.
I was just bowled over by his brilliance.
He was the top author in Germany before Hitler came in.
Gustav had been to Russia with Andrei Malrowe, Pasternak, and Sheed... and lot of the important intellectuals of Europe.
Thought the communism was the answer.
In other words they thought it was gonna put on a lot of new reforms.
And then they found out that it was another form of Nazism.
And that was even almost worse.
So they were disillusioned.
In '37 Gustav was badly wounded.
While visiting the Spanish war.
He was on a back seat of four people and three companions when a shell landed in Gustav's lower back.
Eh they were in a car... it blew up.
It went through the left side and he pulled out from the right.
Missing the kidney by one millimeter.
We were certainly forced to fight in Spain.
When in one battle we had... fifty airplanes against us.
We had only four.
When the States gave no support we knew we were done.
I used to take the train down when school holidays came.
My father came and picked me up.
He would give me a peck on the cheek, and say,
"You carry your own bag and follow me.
"We're not going to waste any money on taxis.
We're going over to Pennsylvania Station and we're going by subway.
The phone rang and he said, "Oh yes, you wrote me."
I said, "Yes, I wrote you a year ago."
He said, "I'm gonna ask the letter now."
I'd like to meet you.
I said, "Where are you?
He said, "I'm on 35th street."
And I said, "Where is 35th?
Why don't you come right over... and we'll talk?"
So I had quite a friendship with him.
Then one day he said, kind of a Krishnamurti trick
I know all about you now
I don't think I wanna see you anymore so goodbye.
That's the way Krishnamurti used to be.
So our friendship came to an end.
The first thing I told him, it was just after Gustav died,
I wasn't able to get over the... shock of having to burn Gustav alive, light the fire.
And set Gustav and burn him on this Ghat.
And that I used to wake up at night seeing myself lighting the fire.
You know it's very hard to burn up your husband.
And he helped me to get over that.
He died by accident in India.
I buried his body on a ghat You know what a ghat is?
What is that?
Ghat is a cement block where you burn the bodies in India.
The ashes I put back in Urpsig.
Totality is that KGS word with another dimension.
I was so into philosophy and mysticism I was studying, studying...
Gustav inspired me and then he goes and dies and you miss all out stimulation.
When I was going to Paris to meet this man that I... he was a great man of my life.
I met him before Gustav died, in Paris.
And I said, "Oh boy, Gustav ever dies that's the man for me.
After Gustav died...
I went to an art exhibition because he was a painter.
And he was there.
But he was married, of course.
They're always married.
So without a long, long sad story.
- Did you get together with him?
- Oh yes.
I've spent a month with him.
But he had this wife and she was very nice.
She, he never... he was always going away leaving her and painting.
It wasn't very good.
They had three children.
They had been separated in the War.
She lived in Rome.
She was very nice and she loved him.
And I said, we cannot...
We've got to say good bye, because you cannot take at 50... it's a dirty trick to take a husband away from a very nice woman.
You know, you just don't do that.
I said, we'd be so ridden with guilt
Thinking while sitting alone.
We have never had a happy day.
Because we both were decent people.
So we had to say good bye.
With great trauma, good-byes and everything.
A year later or two years later...
I said we're not ever gonna see each other again because its gotta stop.
And then two years later I was with Alec.
A friend had given us an apartment right across from the plaza.
Alec went out one afternoon to go to a museum or something.
And I rushed around with.. to gristidius to buy something.
And gristidius was a long thing like this at the back with all the refrigerators.
There was a refrigerator that went like this and like this.
And I go and open this and a hand goes and opens that.
And it's this man.
I said, "What are you doing here?"
He said, "I am around the corner with my wife."
I said, "You know we can't see each other."
Because why we just can't do it.
We both began to sort of shake.
We didn't know what to do.
I said, "Why don't you come up to my place you can stay 20 mins because Alec might be coming back any minute."
so he came up and I said, "Don't sit near me you can sit over there... because I can't touch you because if I do I go to pieces.
It was so natural to fall asleep by his side.
The weekend will be eat and sleep.
We made love and went to the cafe where Voltaire used to eat, cold and grey Paris with Francois Michel.
When you really have been in love with a man and you know what the real thing is you just can't sit around and go with somebody else.
The important men in my life, except for Gustav, were not the men I married.
Of course that was the Landon thing which turned me upside down.
My marriage was sound because it made me realize what a huge mistake I've made.
The difference between Landon and Sam.
Then there was the Alvaro connection.
He was a brilliant man.
Then I realized what a life could be like.
And then I realized what life could be like with another type of man.
And then there was the man between Alec and Gustav.
Which was Seman.
I don't know why I was so bowled over by him.
- In Paris?
- Yeah, in Paris.
Living with him for a while.
- So that's it.
- But you had a very long relationship with Alec.
It was 22 years.
It was only 20 years with Gustav, and 21 with Sam.
So that was it.
Sam Irwin began to call for me after he left law school, at the door of my school and drove me home through that beautiful Fairmount Park.
Day after day, and he left me at my door.
After several months of this devotion marriage was in the air.
My relationship with Sam was never any good because...
I had loved Landon so deeply.
It was very superficial our relationship.
We were both very young, we didn't know what we're doing anyway.
What was the motivation for going Reno?
To get the divorce?
Well get divorce because I couldn't stand living with a drunken man.
And I had all these other men telling me I should leave this kind of alone.
It was just a great mistake.
I had lots of lovers during that time,
because he did too.
He had a mistress.
I called the Travel Bureau and I said
"I have 1200 dollars where can I go?"
Any place with 1200 dollars.
They called me back and said there's a freighter leaving for Baltimore you can... carrying bananas to Haiti
It takes usually 52 people but it hasn't any lifeboats so its only gonna take 5.
You can go on that freighter.
So I said, "Fine".
There were five others.
A married couple, a very unhappy woman and a man, called Artzi Bashev.
He was having a break down.
His wife had sent him off.
So we had the best old time on Tahiti.
The silence of the evening was occasionally interrupted by the blowing of an automobile horn.
Life moved at a faster pace.
He said... he said, you are pathetic.
You are just unhappy, married an American girl, you know nothing about life, sex or men.
You've got three children and you don't know what you are doing.
You'd better come up and spend the night... sleep with me every night...
I'll tell you a little bit what is going on...
I'm married, I'm going back to my wife
I'll never see you again after this trip so I said, sure.
He was up on 8 deck.
We had champagne and big suite and everything.
We had a good time, and we said good bye.
I got to London.
Then I picked up this man... the diplomat who'd asked me to come over.
He met me, came over to the hotel he said, let's go over to the apartment.
I said, fine.
We got to the apartment.
He walked in the door he said, I never wear any clothes in the apartment.
You have to take your clothes off.
I said, that's all right.
Having just had these nights with the Polish man.
We had a very nice few days together.
So ridiculous.
I was married with three children he was this wild man living in London.
A year after going to London, I decided to divorce Sam.
So I went to Rhino, and I hired a governess to take care of the children.
Oh, mother died long before and he doesn't even remember her.
Mother died when Paul was born.
Paul was about 3 or 4.
When mother died.
She adored Paul.
Sam phoned, "I fired the governess you have to come back."
"Crazy blackmail," I said.
Then he came every night at 7 o'clock and he said
Listen, I'm very rich my brother is a big lawyer.
I am getting the children from you.
If you don't marry me again.
He said, you have no money.
Your father won't give you any.
And you can't fight me.
I said, well... let me think it over.
All right.
I'll marry Sam.
So he met me at Baltimore and we got married again.
- You did?
- Yeah.
Then I said, I take Andy 16.
I don't want any trouble.
I want my evenings to myself.
I refuse to play bridge every night with you.
He said, fine.
But I'll give you 50 dollars when you leave.
And that was the contract so he stayed until Andrew was 16.
I think it was about 5 years, I don't remember.
I had lots of lovers during that time because he did too.
He had a mistress.
Ever since I was young I've been reading philosophers, religions...
I was always studying.
Because this man, friend of Sam's, who was a great reader and he told me to read all these things.
Here is one thing.
"Love is self remains constant.
Only the particular body from whom we sometimes come to expect may change."
- That's interesting.
- Yeah.
Religion is nothing but form.
A form way of living.
With lots of rules.
He says, we better get out of this as much further.
There's lots more out there.
And when you get... bring yourself out of that box into the spiritual life you enlarge and you grow
...you expand... into many more higher interests.
And a different form of attitude of life towards people and towards everything that you do.
It was an autumn morning and we were driving through Fairmount Park.
At the upper end of the drive there is a small stream that runs along side and can be seen very clearly.
When we were rounding a bend.
My father said in animated tones,
"Look, Margaret dear, at that group of willows that line the banks of the creek." "Yes," I nodded.
"That, to me, is just what Shakespeare had in mind as the kind of place where poor Ophelia was drowned.
Yes, this is the way it was."
For years I could never pass that spot without imagining Ophelia floating along there with her white dress and long matted hair.
Pearl Harbour.
You know Pearl Harbour we started the war.
Sam decided that he would go to war.
And Paul was called to war.
I kept the children in Mexico and it was Christmas time.
Sam wrote and said, I think it's very important we all have as a family, a reunion in Orlando.
So we went.
We had... we all had terrible time getting there.
Cause you just couldn't travel in war time.
How did you get there?
You know, there were soldiers on the train and everything.
In the morning the next day, a large envelope, mailed from Mexico was delivered to me.
I had called... told Gustav that I was going.
And Gustav said, that he wanted to write me a diary.
And that he would mail it to me to Orlando.
But in order to disguise it he would call himself...
What did he call himself?
He called me Pug and called my father King Lear.
We had different names.
So this diary comes for me.
And it's censored by the army.
It's partly in German and French.
He liked to change it around because he knew Sam couldn't understand them.
Sam said, what a hell is this?
The army has decided that you are a spy.
I'm gonna be kicked out of the army and you're going to have to go... you're gonna have a hearing tomorrow.
And explain this diary.
So I went and I said well... it happens to be someone that I know that I love very much.
They found out it was just a love letter, you see.
But that broke up the marriage pretty well.
So that's the end of that story.
We went every morning and set around with Krishnamurti.
It was then that he invited us to Madras.
And of course we didn't get there because Gustav died in New Delhi.
I went into a state of shock.
I used to wake up at night seeing myself lighting the fire.
Of course, Gustav was a big thing in my life.
I was just bowled over by his brilliance.
And his terrific experience and all the horrors he'd had in his life.
He was like a cat with nine lives I mean he's almost killed and died so many times.
His son died killed by the Nazis,
Then he landed in Mexico with a wife with cancer and... having his son die... killed by the Nazis, it was just one tragic thing after another.
He said, that his affection for me was that I was so full of life.
And he had had so much death.
He wanted to hold on to me because I sort of could revive him.
It was just one tragic thing after another.
Bring him back while his wife was dying.
Then I got nervous about the relationship.
Because I didn't think I should be having this strong relationship.
It wasn't fair to the wife.
So I left Mexico.
I went to live in Washington.
13... a year before she died.
So that she wouldn't get wind of the thing.
That was a very difficult year.
That was in 19...
You know the War ended in '45.
I went I think the end of '43 to Washington.
A year later I ran over a squirrel.
We had little meat so I took it home and cooked it.
I don't know why I did that.
The War was over, Paul was safe.
He wrote, I may go to Japan, damn it.
Because he'd been fighting.
They said, we have to take the season troops to Japan.
Paul was in that but then the bomb came.
Then came the end.
Paul telephoned for 5 minutes from overseas.
The same day, then Sam telephoned.
And said, let's get married again.
And then Gustav telephoned.
All this happened on one day that Marie Louise had died.
So I was going to marry him.
Then Gustav called me up a month or two later and he said.
I have 400 dollars in the bank.
I said, I couldn't come.
I couldn't leave the children.
I had no money.
He called up and said, I have 400 dollars in the bank,
I'm sending it all to you and I'm not eating until you come.
I received the money draft from Gustav.
It was all he had.
But enough for me to come for 10 days.
Both of us were completely penniless but happy.
We took a second class bus to Veracruz where he knew a woman who has been a grenade thrower in the war in Spain.
I think that's enough.
Don't you, Dana?
- Well, I tell you one more thing here.
- Ok.
My mother told me.
She'd had some children.
She had all these boys and she was exhausted.
She nursed all of them for 2 years or something.
She had gone 4 years without any children.
Three years.
She was having menopause.
She thought this is just wonderful I am through.
Father came over to go to the library.
She came to New York.
And she went to the doctor... and he said, you are pregnant.
Oh my God.
Another boy.
She had five in a row.
That was six all together.
She met father at the library.
She sat in front of this lion on a bench and cried.
She wasn't strong enough to have...
She was never well after I came.
Because she haemorrhaged
And you know she died quite young.
And I think my father blamed me a lot on her death because it really brought her down.
She never should have had this child.
Those days they did not know what to do so...
The only thing was if it's a girl it won't be so bad.
I told that to Gustav and this is what he said.
It's so sweet.
"Your mother hesitated to launch you into the century.
But I invite you to a tour de monde, a tour the world."
He invited me to go around the world.

Schedule "Delta Wing" for maintenance at 1400 and make sure Conference Room 7 is properly laid out for the Tikar delegation.
Six yarwood chairs placed precisely one meter apart in a star pattern with the hee-lok on the center chair.
Very good.
-Sheridan.
-"Captain..."
...there's a problem in the ambassadorial section.
We need a command officer.
I'll handle it.
Help is on the way.
It's good to be the captain.
Isogi-san.
Talia, it's been too long.
What did you think of my NeoMars proposal?
It's like all your proposals: too progressive, too risky and too costly in the short run.
-But if you can make it happen....
-I must make it happen.
FutureCorp has to expand beyond Earth, and Mars is the first step.
The Senate won't like it, and the Mars Conglomerate will try to bury you.
We're prepared for that.
Now I need only convince Mars to share the risk.
And if they won't?
Then their path to freedom may well be drenched with innocent blood and a long-held dream of mine will die.
Mr. Isogi?
Amanda Carter, Mars Colony Business Affairs Committee.
Ms. Carter, Ms. Talia Winters one of the finest commercial telepaths I've ever worked with.
She will be monitoring our negotiations for FutureCorp.
Ms. Winters.
Please.
I read your proposal, Mr. Isogi.
Frankly, you're either insane or a very brave man.
That's what they said of your great-grandfather, John when he volunteered to pilot the first colony ship to Mars.
So they did.
Let's talk.
Please.
--"begin by focusing more on the needs" of our own people to move on to create the world that Luis Santiago....
Thirteen.
All components have arrived safely on Babylon 5.
Control is prepared to go online.
Commence operation.
The Babylon Project was our last, best hope for peace.
"A self"-"contained world, five miles long," located in neutral territory.
A place of commerce and diplomacy for a quarter of a million humans and aliens.
A shining beacon in space, all alone in the night.
It was the dawn of the Third Age of mankind.
The year the Great War came upon us all.
This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations.
The year is 2259.
The name of the place is Babylon 5.
Sheridan.
Captain, you have a transmission from Senator Voudreau.
Patch her through.
Capt. Sheridan.
Senator, what can I do for you?
Taro Isogi, chief executive of FutureCorp has arranged a meeting on Babylon 5 with Amanda Carter a representative of the Mars Provisional Government.
Carter is an outspoken advocate of Mars independence and we suspect FutureCorp is conspiring with her to finance another rebellion on Mars Colony.
Do you have any proof?
We know FutureCorp desperately wants a foothold in space.
An exclusive trade and services agreement with Mars would give it to them if they could move the current Mars Conglomerate out.
Many of the members wanted to pull out after the last rebellion.
Another would have them running like river rats.
I understand your concern, but there's not much I can do about it.
I have no authority over corporate negotiations.
Babylon 5 is neutral territory.
Any race can negotiate here without interference, even our own.
This is a possible threat to Earth Alliance security, captain and as such, we are asking you to check it out.
Nothing official.
Just keep an eye peeled and an ear open and report anything of interest to me.
With all due respect, senator my duties as commander of B5 don't include spying on civilians.
These are volatile times, captain.
Practicality is more important than principles if lives are to be saved.
I'll expect to hear from you soon.
-Yes?
-"Captain..."
...the Tikar delegation is docking.
I'll meet them in the conference room immediately.
Mars has resources the alien worlds need.
Now, they in turn can supply an economic base which will enable the colony to become self-sufficient within 10 years.
You can win your independence without bloodshed.
It will be a hard sell with the Committee.
They'll need concrete assurances from the alien worlds.
Not entirely true.
You're sure the Committee will accept your recommendation.
You're the one who needs assurance.
Yes, I do, Ms. Winters.
Mars is being ripped apart at the seams right now and before I bargain with its future, I need to know what's expected of us.
Naturally.
That's one of the reasons why I suggested Babylon 5 for this meeting.
All our prospective partners have representatives here.
We can iron out all the details to your government's satisfaction.
You actually believe you can make this work?
No, I believe we can try.
I'll speak with the Business Affairs Committee.
I think I can have an answer by tomorrow afternoon.
Very good.
She likes the idea.
She has her doubts, but basically she likes it.
And you?
Now that you've heard the details of my little plan do you also have your doubts?
Frankly, yes.
The financial risk is bad enough but the legal maneuvering will be even--
I want to hear them.
Over dinner?
I'd love to.
Well, commander, may I?
Please.
How did the conference go?
Very well, very well.
Your seating arrangement was flawless.
Latir Corvo himself complimented it.
I think we'll be seeing the Tikar on Babylon 5 soon.
I'm pleased.
They're an interesting people.
And I believe you made first contact with them.
Yes.
The "Agamemnon" was in an unexplored sector beyond the St. Andre Nebula when we sighted this green cloud floating in space.
Only, it wasn't a cloud at all.
It was a ship.
We hailed it, but got no response.
We moved toward it.
It moved away.
We kept that up for hours, until finally they responded.
It took our linguistics division a whole day to get even close to deciphering their language.
They'd already deciphered ours but neglected to tell us so.
Oh, a Jovian sunspot.
-You're indulging.
-I earned it.
And I'm off duty.
Please, continue.
Well, we finally broke the language barrier and introduced ourselves.
And I was invited aboard their ship.
It was incredible.
I'd never seen so much space on a starship.
And the Tikar themselves so unlike any other alien species we'd encountered.
I spent two days with them.
And what I learned in that time made me realize just how wondrous this galaxy of ours really is.
I've never seen you so excited about a deal before.
Well, it's not just a deal, Talia.
It's a step into the future.
Mars can be the beginning of a whole new life for the human species as it was meant to be.
Free Mars.
No!
Taro!
Taro.
So you have no idea what the images you got from the killer meant?
No, it was all too quick.
Just a blur of light and sound and then the blackness.
And all he said was, "Free Mars"?
Yes, but my first assignment was Mars Colony.
I scanned several Free Mars people during that time.
They're violent fanatics with a murderous hatred of Earth Alliance.
But this man was different.
There was no thought of a cause in his head, no anger no emotion of any kind, just those images.
So, what reason would Free Mars have for killing your client?
None.
Taro's proposal was a peaceful solution to the Mars problem.
Earth Central feels differently.
They believe he was going to back another rebellion on Mars.
Taro hated the violence on Mars.
He never would have done such a thing.
Someone's been lying to you, captain.
-Or to you.
-I'm a telepath.
Telepaths are human beings.
You are an old friend of Isogi's.
-You trusted him.
-With good reason.
Taro Isogi spent his life improving the lives of others.
He built a business based on that principle and he never broke a rule or harmed another to do it.
Mars was his dream, captain.
Now he's been murdered for it, and you're trying to cast the blame on him.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
I'm also tired, and I hurt.
May I go back to my quarters now?
Yes.
I'll arrange for an escort.
One escort, at your service.
This really isn't necessary.
Captain's orders.
He's worried about you, and so am I.
This gives us a chance to get to know each other better.
I've led a fascinating life.
Mr. Garibaldi, Taro Isogi was like a father to me.
I loved him as a client and as a mentor and as a friend.
And now he's dead.
You'll forgive me if I'm not in the mood for your usual badinage.
You're right.
This is a bad time for you.
I'm being a yutz.
Apology accepted.
Could you at least tell me what badinage means?
Well, my pop always said that laughter was better than pills for what ails you.
He was right.
We'll get the creep who did this.
I promise.
That won't bring Taro back, or his dreams for Mars Colony.
No.
But it will save someone else from getting killed.

Location of Talia Winters.
I want you to hold all outgoing traffic until further notice.
There's been a murder, and I don't want the killer leaving.
-Do you know who it is?
-Not yet.
But we do have an eyewitness, Talia Winters.
Was she hurt?
Fortunately not.
I think the killer wanted a witness.
Tell me.
What do you think of her?
Ms. Winters?
I think she's an interesting person.
You never describe anybody that way.
I don't really know her that well.
We've chatted from time to time.
And she's interesting.
You know how I feel about telepaths.
Do I ever!
You threw one out of a third-story window on lo.
-There was a pool below the window.
-I'll assume you knew that.
Aside from Ms. Winters' "interesting" quality do you think she can be trusted?
Yes, except she's very loyal to Psi Corps.
And you don't trust Psi Corps?
No.
Do you?
Telepaths are gifted and cursed in ways I can never hope to understand.
But they're still human beings, good, bad or indifferent.
No.
I trust in individuals, not organizations.
Then you may trust Ms. Winters.
Come in.
Ms. Carter, I'm Capt. John Sheridan, commander of Babylon 5.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about your meeting with Taro Isogi.
I'm afraid I must decline, captain.
Private negotiations are not subject to Earthforce scrutiny.
In this case, they are.
Mr. Isogi was murdered last night.
What?
Who could--?
According to an eyewitness, the killer said, "Free Mars."
Free Mars?
Yes.
No, that can't be.
There's no way they could have known about this meeting.
And even if they did, they had nothing to gain by killing Mr. Isogi.
Taro was working to achieve a peaceful compromise that would ensure the colony's independence without bloodshed.
Somebody obviously didn't like it.
Damn them.
Any idea who "they" might be?
The Senate, Mars Conglomerate.
They'd be the most opposed.
I never thought they'd go this far.
Thank you for your time, Ms. Carter.
I may have more questions for you later.
I'll be glad to help.
Whoever killed Taro Isogi killed Mars' best hope for the future.
What have you come up with?
Forensics said Isogi's body was hit with a massive electrical charge.
Disrupted every cell in his body.
There's scorch marks on his throat that show the outline of fingers but no prints or striations of any kind.
A slaver's glove?
No.
I mean, they pack a jolt but not enough to do this much damage.
No, this is high-tech and definitely not standard Free Mars issue.
My guess is some sort of prosthetic weaponry.
What I can't figure is how he got it on station.
A power source that would generate that big a charge should show up on scanners.
Maybe he had some special help.
You want to explain that?
Not until we have more to go on.
Keep an escort on Ms. Winters and intensify the search.
Include EarthGov and Corp secure areas.
Will do.
Captain?
I'd like to know where you're going with this.
Someplace very dark.
I hope to God I'm wrong.
Hey, Earther!
Free Mars.
No.
Help!
Help me, somebody!
What have they done to me?
The images in his mind were the same as before except this time I saw an Earth Alliance ship.
A big one.
A cruiser, I think.
It was firing at him.
And I know this sounds crazy.
But it hit him, and he died.
Died?
It was as if he were reliving the thought of his death over and over again clinging to it as if it were the only thought he had.
Captain, I've got an ID on our perp.
I checked the DNA in the hair that Ms. Winters pulled out.
It's positive.
Take a look.
-That's him.
-He's Free Mars, all right.
One of their leaders in fact.
Name's Abel Horn.
-Abel Horn?
-Do you know him?
In a way.
My wife Anna and I had some very special friends on Mars.
They worked at Ritchey Station.
They were there when Free Mars blew it.
Abel Horn claimed responsibility for it.
I want him, Mr. Garibaldi.
So do I, but there's a problem.
According to Earthforce Intelligence, Abel Horn is dead.
A cruiser scragged his ship over Phobos during the rebellion.
Oh, my God.
Is that what you saw in his mind?
Yes.
Would someone tell me what the hell we're talking about?
Sir?
Later.
Right now I want her in protective custody and a fugitive alert posted on Horn.
Done.
Ms. Winters.
Amanda.
It's been a long time.
I thought you were dead.
Damn near.
Earthers blew me up over Phobos.
Your old buddy Singer found me, got me out.
A snakehead doc fixed me up.
I've been hiding in the Tigris Sector ever since.
Then I got word you were coming here.
-Why did you kill Taro Isogi?
-Who?
The man I came here to meet.
They say you killed him.
There's a fugitive alert out for you.
They're lying.
I haven't killed anyone.
I came here to see you.
I have to get back to Mars, and you're the only one who can help me.
I can't do that, Abel.
I am finally in a position to help with Mars independence.
If anyone found out I was once a member of Free Mars--
Which just might come out if they were to catch me here.
You came here to blackmail me into smuggling you back to Mars?
That was never your style, Abel.
I've changed.
Abel, what's wrong?
Abel!
Amanda, please.
Have to...help me!
Help me!
Did something to...to me.
Telepath knows.
Talia Winters saw it in my head!
Have to find her!
-Lose, lose, lose, lose, losing control!
-Stop!
Stop!
There's one way in, and I have a detail on it.
It'll take an army to get in.
If you need to go somewhere, call the guard post and they'll assign an escort.
Try to relax, enjoy yourself.
We'll take care of this guy.
Mr. Garibaldi?
I was just going to make a cup of tea to soothe my nerves.
Would you like one?
Well, since I am chief of Security, I guess seeing you're secure is my job.
And tea just happens to be my third favorite thing in the universe.
I needed this yesterday.
The captain of the "Matheson" is demanding an update on his departure.
Tell him to go away.
Tell them all to go away.
-How's it going?
-We've had 20 complaints six formal protests and one threat, all in the last hour.
The natives are restless.
Start moving them out.
What about the murderer?
I don't think he's trying to leave yet.
But have every ship searched.
I'll be in my quarters.
There's something I want to check out.
So then my pop says to the guy, "Fifty credits for a salami?
I could've killed you for 20."
-Your father was quite a character.
-He was the best.
He cooked like an angel, swore like the devil and taught me everything about security.
He could spot a crook a sector away, and he was still hauling them in at 75.
Then he got Torg's Syndrome and just kind of faded away.
I sure miss him.
I never really knew my father or my mother.
I was raised by Psi Corps from the time I was 5.
-Of course, there was Abby.
-Abby?
She was my support during my first year at the Center.
When telepaths first come, a senior telepath guides them through the program.
The first day I was crying all the time.
I was scared and confused and hurting.
And then Abby came.
She held me for a very long time, never saying a word.
I didn't know it then, but she was scanning me, ever so gently.
And little by little, the pain and fear and confusion melted.
And all that was left was this warm, safe place in my mind.
It was wonderful.
But the next year Abby was assigned to another newcomer.
Garibaldi.
Mr. Garibaldi, please report to my quarters.
On my way.
Sorry.
Mr. Garibaldi.
Thank you.
My pleasure, Ms. Winters.
Come.
Mr. Garibaldi, take a look at this.
Project Lazarus?
Never heard of it.
It was part of Earthforce's cyber experiments back in the late '30s.
The cyber experiments were a bust.
Humans couldn't function...
-...with machines in their brains.
-Correct.
That's why they decided to use subjects on the verge of death:
Accident victims, wounded soldiers, people in comas--
You're kidding?
That's grotesque.
It gets even better.
The theory was to hardwire the subject's brain with a computer intelligence.
It kept the brain functional while the body was repaired.
Then using telepathic deep-scan the subject was fixated on the moment of his death shutting down all conscious thought.
The computer takes complete control while the subject is dying over and over again in his subconscious.
Ms. Winters said that Horn was clinging to the thought of his death as if it were the only thought he had.
Hold on.
Are you saying Horn is one of these cyber zombies?
I'm saying he might be.
His body could have been recovered after the blast.
Or Intelligence was wrong again, and Horn was never in the ship that was blasted.
Well, that's the simple explanation.
And ordinarily I'd accept it, but this isn't a simple thing.
A known Free Mars terrorist kills a man in front of a witness and leaves her alive.
Later he kills another man to get to that witness and again leaves her alive.
Why?
He's squeamish about killing women?
Or maybe Talia Winters touched something in him.
Something that made Horn realize who he really was for a moment.
I think it's playing havoc with his programming.
-You almost have me believing this load.
-I'm not sure I believe it myself.
But if it's true, there should be a way to locate him.
Command?
I'd like to make a transmission to Ms. Talia Winters.
Working.
-So you'll meet with me?
-"Yes.
In a half"-"hour?"
I'll look forward to it.
-Amanda, I knew you'd help me.
-Abel, all I did was--
This is a long shot.
My information on Lazarus is 20 years old but according to the files the computer power crystal emits a low level of a benign radiation.
It wouldn't ordinarily show up on the environmental scanners but if we could reconfigure them to look for it....
-Garibaldi.
-"Chief, Zack Allan."
Ms. Winters is requesting an escort for a business meeting in Red 7.
-With who?
-"Amanda Carter."
That's a go, Zack.
Come through Red Alpha.
I'll join you at Point 6.
This is trickier than I thought.
The element is definitely out-of-date.
Why not let the wizard have a go?
Now, all we have to do is cross-reference with the Medlab files find the updated element number log that with e-systems and, voilá!
It's trickier than you thought.
Thanks Mr. Wizard.
Ms. Winters, it's not a good idea to be roaming around the station.
I'm hardly roaming.
No, I guess not.
So, what's up?
Amanda Carter wants to pursue Taro's plan.
I don't know if I can convince FutureCorp to go along but if I could, it would be like a memorial for Taro.
They can kill a good man but not a good idea.
Take your time.
We'll be right here.
Hello?
Hello?
Ms. Carter?
Ms. Carter.
Make one sound, and I'll kill you.
That should do it.
Computer, begin scan.
Commencing.
What am I?
Tell me!
I don't understand.
You're a mindbender.
You saw it in my head.
Tell me what it means!
Tell me!
-Pain.
Pain.
-Yes, pain!
Tell me.
Tell me, please.
Please.
Ours now.
All ours.
You were dying.
They operated on you, rebuilt you.
Scanned you.
There was a Psi Cop.
Scan complete.
"Low"-"level ironium radiation detected."
Red 7, Suite 15.
Suite 15?
Amanda Carter.
Garibaldi.
-"Captain?"
-Where's Ms. Winters?
Meeting with Ms. Carter in her quarters.
Our perp's inside.
Get him, but get him alive.
I'm on my way.
Our perp's inside!
Jackson, left side.
Hansen, right.
Watch out for Talia and remember this guy kills by touch.
Zack, let's get the door.
Ready?
Go.
Freeze!
I'll fry her.
I swear it.
End of the road, pal.
There's nowhere to go.
-Come on, think about it.
-Can't think.
Die when I think.
Okay, okay.
-Take it easy.
-Drop the guns.
Back off.
Do it!
You hurt her and I'll see it takes you 10 days to die.
I'm already dead, Mr. Security Man.
No, you aren't, Horn.
Now, just listen to me.
They are using you to betray your own world.
How do you know this?
You know it too, Abel.
You can feel the machine crawling in your brain.
Get out of my way!
Let us help you.
That's all we want to do.
You let her go, and we'll help you.
You've died too many times, Abel.
There's no need to die again.
Good.
Now, put the weapon down.
It was the Earthers, wasn't it?
It wasn't enough just to kill me?
We'll find out who it was together.
Just put the gun down.
Mars will never be free until the sands run red with Earther blood.
Thanks for ending it, Earther.
Damn it.
Captain, I'm reading a dangerous energy surge from the body.
Get her out of here.
Come on, everybody out.
Everybody out!
Come on!
Go now!
No trace.
No evidence.
I am very sorry, Ms. Winters.
Abel said you knew what was wrong with him.
I was worried about him.
-I didn't think he'd harm you.
-And how does a Mars Government rep know so much about a Free Mars terrorist?
Abel Horn wasn't always a terrorist.
Fifteen years ago he was a bright young man utterly devoted to independence for Mars Colony.
That's when I met him.
Fell in love with him.
He convinced me to join Free Mars.
It wasn't a radical group at the time.
Later, when they began to become violent, I left them.
I never saw Abel again until today.
Tell me another one.
You can have Ms. Winters scan me if you think I'm lying.
Besides, I've already said enough to ruin my career.
If we report it.
Are you proposing a deal, captain?
You said Taro Isogi's plan was the best hope for Mars.
-Did you mean that?
-Yes.
Then continue to negotiate with FutureCorp.
Make that happen.
I doubt they'd be interested after what happened here.
I'll be glad to speak to them for you.
I'll make it clear that your government had nothing to do with the murder.
I'm sure they'll consider going ahead.
Why?
To make sure Taro Isogi's dream becomes a reality and to keep you where you can do the most good.
Thank you.
We'll talk later.
Captain, begging your pardon, but have you gone space happy?
She is an accessory to murder and attempted murder.
Horn wasn't trying to kill me.
He wanted me to scan him.
There was something in his mind, controlling him...
-...something he wanted me to find.
-And did you?
I saw an image, some sort of an operation.
Well, did you recognize anything?
A location, a face, uniform?
No.
Take Ms. Winters to her quarters.
I'll help lvanova move the traffic out.
Captain.
Mr. Garibaldi.
Is there something?
There's a whole list.
But let's start with how you knew about the Lazarus Project.
Some people collect coins or art.
I collect secrets.
Black projects, conspiracies, secret organizations.
They fascinate me.
Does one of those secrets include who was behind this thing?
-It's better you don't ask that.
-Look, captain you don't trust me the way Jeff used to, but if there's a threat--
The threat goes far beyond Babylon 5, Mr. Garibaldi.
I'm not surprised.
If Horn was what you say he was, then this has nothing to do with Free Mars.
To pull something like this off would take a lot of power and a lot of money.
And I think you know who it is.
All right.
But promise me this information will never be repeated outside this room.
You got it.
For the past six years there have been rumors about a rogue agency operating deep inside EarthGov.
A dirty-trick squad dealing in black projects and star chamber justice.
It took me over three years just to get a name.
Bureau 13.
And the man who gave me that name died soon after.
I am convinced they exist and that they are behind this incident.
Why?
Isogi was a danger to Earth policy on Mars.
I think his death was a warning to the other corporations.
I also think Horn was meant to destroy Free Mars from the inside and possibly ruin Amanda Carter as well.
Unfortunately...
-...
I can't prove any of it.
-If this is true--
Then everything we believe in is in jeopardy.
There is a spider in the web, Mr. Garibaldi.
And I intend to find it and kill it.
Thirteen.
Report from Babylon 5 Control.
Mission only partly successful.
Isogi terminated but unit was destroyed before he could leave station for Mars.
Is the Bureau at hazard?
Control does not believe so.
Belief is not enough.
He is to follow up until he is certain.

TaIia, it's been too long.
What did you think of my NeoMars proposal?
Like all your proposals: too progressive, too risky and too costly in the short run.
-But if you can make it happen... .
-I must make it happen.
FutureCorp has to expand beyond Earth, and Mars is the first step.
The Senate won't like it, and the Mars conglomerate will try to bury you.
We're prepared for that.
Now I need only convince Mars to share the risk.
And if they won't?
Then their path to freedom may well be drenched with innocent blood...

Thirteen.
All components have arrived safely on Babylon 5.
Control is prepared to go online.
Commence operation.
The Babylon Project was our last, best hope for peace.
A self-contained world, five miles long, located in neutral territory.
A place of commerce and diplomacy for a quarter of a million humans and aliens.
A shining beacon in space, all alone in the night.
It was the dawn of the Third Age of mankind.
The year the Great War came upon us all.
This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations.
The year is 2259.
The name of the place is Babylon 5.
Sheridan.
Captain, you have a transmission from Senator Voudreau.
Patch her through.
Capt. Sheridan.
Senator, what can I do for you?
Taro Isogi, chief executive of futurecorp has arranged a meeting on Babylon 5 with Amanda Carter a representative of the Mars Provisional Government.
Carter is an outspoken advocate of Mars independence and we suspect futurecorp is conspiring with her to finance another rebellion on Mars Colony.
Do you have any proof?
We know futurecorp desperately wants a foothold in space.
An exclusive trade and services agreement with Mars would give it to them if they could move the current Mars Conglomerate out.
Many of the members wanted to pull out after the last rebellion.
Another would have them running like river rats.
I understand your concern, but there's not much I can do about it.
I have no authority over corporate negotiations.
babylon 5 is neutral territory.
Any race can negotiate here without interference, even our own.
This is a possible threat to Earth Alliance security, captain and as such, we are asking you to check it out.
Nothing offic]ial.
Just keep an eye peeled and an ear open and report anything of interest to me.
With all due respect, senator...
... mydutiesas commanderofB5 don't include spying on civilians.
These are volatile times, captain.
Practicality is more important than principles if lives are to be saved.
I'll expect to hear from you soon.
-Yes?
-Captain the Tikar delegation is docking.
I'II meet them in the conference room immediately.
Mars has resources the alien worlds need.
Now, they in turn can supply an economic base...
... whichwillenablethe colonytobecome seIf-sufficient within 1 0 years.
You can win your independence without bloodshed.
It will be a hard sell with the Committee.
They'II need concrete assurances from the alien worlds.
Not entirely true.
You're sure the Committee will accept your recommendation.
You're the one who needs assurance.
Yes, I do, Ms. Winters.
Mars is being ripped apart at the seams right now...
... andbeforeIbargainwith itsfuture, I need to know what's expected of us.
naturally.
That's one of the reasons why I suggested babylon 5 for this meeting.
AII our prospective partners have representatives here.
We can iron out all the details to your government's satisfaction.
You actually believe you can make this work?
No, I believe we can try.
I'II speak with the Business Affairs Committee.
I think I can have an answer by tomorrow afternoon.
Very good.
She likes the idea.
She has her doubts, but basically she likes it.
And you?
Now that you've heard the details of my little plan...
... doyoualsohaveyour doubts?
frankly, yes.
The financial risk is bad enough...
... butthelegalmaneuvering will be even--
I want to hear them.
Over dinner?
I'd love to.
well, commander, may I?
please.
How did the conference go?
Very well, very well.
Your seating arrangement was flawless.
Latir Corvo himself complimented it.
I think we'II be seeing the Tikar on babylon 5 soon.
I'm pleased.
They're an interesting people.
And I believe you made first contact with them.
Yes.
The Agamemnon was in an unexplored sector beyond the St. Andre nebula...
... whenwesightedthisgreencloud floating in space.
only, it wasn't a cloud at all.
It was a ship.
We hailed it, but got no response.
We moved toward it.
It moved away.
We kept that up for hours, until finally they responded.
It took our linguistics division a whole day...
... togetevenclosetodeciphering their language.
They'd already deciphered ours but neglected to tell us so.
Oh, a Jovian sunspot.
-You're indulging.
-I earned it.
And I'm off duty.
please, continue.
well, we finally broke the language barrier and introduced ourselves.
And I was invited aboard their ship.
It was incredible.
I'd never seen so much space on a starship.
And the Tikar themselves...
... sounlikeanyotheralienspecies we'd encountered.
I spent two days with them.
And what I Iearned in that time...
... mademerealizejusthowwondrous this galaxy of ours really is.
I've never seen you so excited about a deal before.
well, it's not just a deal, TaIia.
It's a step into the future.
Mars can be the beginning of a whole new life for the human species...
... asitwasmeanttobe .
Free Mars.
No!
Taro!
Taro.
So you have no idea...
... whattheimagesyou got from the killer meant?
No, it was all too quick.
Just a blur of light and sound and then the blackness.
And all he said was, ""Free Mars""?
Yes, but my first assignment was Mars colony.
I scanned several Free Mars people during that time.
They're violent fanatics with a murderous hatred of Earth alliance.
But this man was different.
There was no thought of a cause in his head, no anger...
... noemotionof anykind, just those images.
So, what reason would Free Mars have for killing your client?
None.
Taro's proposal was a peaceful solution to the Mars problem.
Earth central feels differently.
They believe he was going to back another rebellion on Mars.
Taro hated the violence on Mars.
He never would have done such a thing.
Someone's been lying to you, captain.
-Or to you.
-I'm a telepath.
TeIepaths are human beings.
You are an old friend of Isogi's.
-You trusted him.
-With good reason.
Taro Isogi spent his life improving the lives of others.
He built a business based on that principle...
... andheneverbrokearuleorharmed another to do it.
Mars was his dream, captain.
Now he's been murdered for it, and you're trying to cast the blame on him.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
I'm also tired, and I hurt.
May I go back to my quarters now?
Yes.
I'II arrange for an escort.
One escort, at your service.
This really isn't necessary.
Captain's orders.
He's worried about you, and so am I.
This gives us a chance to get to know each other better.
I've led a fascinating life.
Mr. GaribaIdi, Taro Isogi was like a father to me.
I Ioved him as a client and as a mentor and as a friend.
And now he's dead.
You'II forgive me if I'm not in the mood for your usual badinage.
You're right.
This is a bad time for you.
I'm being a yutz.
apology accepted.
could you at Ieast tell me what badinage means?
well, my pop always said that laughter was better than pills for what ails you.
He was right.
We'II get the creep who did this.
I promise.
That won't bring Taro back, or his dreams for Mars colony.
No.
But it will save someone else from getting killed.

I think the killer wanted a witness.

I don't really know her that well.
We've chatted from time to time.

You know how I feel about teIepaths.

You threw one out of a third-story window on Io.

No.

Then you may trust Ms. Winters.
Come in.
Ms. Carter, I'm Capt. John Sheridan, commander of babylon 5.
I'd Iike to ask you a few questions about your meeting with Taro Isogi.
I'm afraid I must decline, captain.
Private negotiations are not subject to Earthforce scrutiny.
In this case, they are.
Mr. Isogi was murdered last night.
What?
Who couId--?
According to an eyewitness, the killer said, ""Free Mars. ""
Free Mars?
Yes.
No, that can't be.
There's no way they could have known about this meeting.
And even if they did, they had nothing to gain by killing Mr. Isogi.
Taro was working to achieve a peaceful compromise...
... thatwouldensurethe colony's independence...
... withoutbloodshed.
Somebody obviously didn't like it.
Damn them.
Any idea who ""they"" might be?
The Senate, Mars conglomerate.
They'd be the most opposed.
I never thought they'd go this far.
Thank you for your time, Ms. Carter.
I may have more questions for you later.
I'II be glad to help.
Whoever killed Taro Isogi killed Mars' best hope for the future.
What have you come up with?
Forensics said Isogi's body was hit with a massive electrical charge.
Disrupted every cell in his body.
There's scorch marks on his throat that show the outline of fingers...
... butnoprintsorstriationsofany kind.
A slaver's glove?
No.
I mean, they pack a jolt but not enough to do this much damage.
No, this is high-tech and definitely not standard Free Mars issue.
My guess is some sort of prosthetic weaponry.
What I can't figure is how he got it on station.
A power source that would generate that big a charge should show up on scanners.
Maybe he had some special help.
You want to explain that?
Not until we have more to go on.
Keep an escort on Ms. Winters and intensify the search.
include earthgov and Corp secure areas.
will do.
Captain?
I'd Iike to know where you're going with this.
someplace very dark.
I hope to God I'm wrong.
Hey, Earther!
Free Mars.
No.
help!
help me, somebody!
What have they done to me?
The images in his mind were the same as before except...
... thistimeIsaw anEarthallianceship.
A big one.
A cruiser, I think.
It was firing at him.
And I know this sounds crazy.
But it hit him, and he died.
Died?
It was as if he were reliving the thought of his death over and over again...
... clingingtoit as if it were the only thought he had.
Captain, I've got an ID on our perp.
I checked the DNA in the hair that Ms. Winters pulled out.
It's positive.
Take a look.
-That's him.
-He's Free Mars, all right.
One of their leaders in fact.
Name's AbeI Horn.
-AbeI Horn?
-Do you know him?
In a way.
My wife, Anna, and I had some very special friends on Mars.
They worked at Ritchey Station.
They were there when Free Mars blew it.
abel Horn claimed responsibility for it.
I want him, Mr. GaribaIdi.
So do I, but there's a problem.
According to Earthforce intelligence, abel Horn is dead.
A cruiser scragged his ship over Phobos during the rebellion.
Oh, my God.
Is that what you saw in his mind?
Yes.
would someone tell me what the hell we're talking about?
Sir?
Later.
Right now I want her in protective custody and a fugitive alert posted on Horn.
Done.
Ms. Winters.
Amanda.
It's been a Iong time.
I thought you were dead.
Damn near.
Earthers blew me up over Phobos.
Your old buddy Singer found me, got me out.
A snakehead doc fixed me up.
I've been hiding in the Tigris Sector ever since.
Then I got word you were coming here.
-Why did you kill Taro Isogi?
-Who?
The man I came here to meet.
They say you killed him.
There's a fugitive alert out for you.
They're lying.
I haven't killed anyone.
I came here to see you.
I have to get back to Mars, and you're the only one who can help me.
I can't do that, abel.
I am finally in a position to help with Mars independence.
If anyone found out I was once a member of Free Mars--
Which just might come out if they were to catch me here.
You came here to blackmail me into smuggling you back to Mars?
That was never your style, abel.
I've changed.
abel, what's wrong?
abel!
Amanda, please.
Have to... helpme!
help me!
Did something to... tome.
TeIepath knows.
TaIia Winters...
... sawitin my head!
Have to find her!
-Lose, lose, lose, lose, losing control!
-Stop!
Stop!
There's one way in, and I have a detail on it.

She was my support during my first year at the Center.
When teIepaths first come, a senior teIepath guides them through the program.
The first day I was crying all the time.
I was scared and confused and hurting.
And then Abby came.
She held me for a very long time, never saying a word.
I didn't know it then, but she was scanning me, ever so gently.
And little by little, the pain and fear and confusion melted.
And all that was left was this warm, safe place in my mind.
It was wonderful.
But the next year Abby was assigned to another newcomer.
GaribaIdi.
Mr. Garibaldi, please report to my quarters.
On my way.
Sorry.
Mr. GaribaIdi.
Thank you.
My pleasure, Ms. Winters.
Come.
Mr. GaribaIdi, take a look at this.
Project Lazarus?
Never heard of it.
It was part of Earthforce's cyber experiments back in the late '30s.
The cyber experiments were a bust.
Humans couldn't function...
-... withmachinesin theirbrains.
-Correct.
That's why they decided to use subjects on the verge of death:
Accident victims, wounded soldiers, people in comas--
You're kidding?
That's grotesque.
It gets even better.
The theory was to hardwire the subject's brain with a computer intelligence.
It kept the brain functional while the body was repaired.
Then using telepathic deep-scan...
... thesubjectwasfixated on the moment of his death...
... shuttingdownallconsciousthought.
The computer takes complete control...
... whilethesubjectisdyingover and over again in his subconscious.
Ms. Winters said that Horn was clinging to the thought of his death...
... asifit werethe onlythoughthehad .
hold on.
Are you saying Horn is one of these cyber zombies?
I'm saying he might be.
His body could have been recovered after the blast.
Or intelligence was wrong again, and Horn was never in the ship that was blasted.
well, that's the simple explanation.
And ordinarily I'd accept it, but this isn't a simple thing.
A known Free Mars terrorist kills a man in front of a witness and leaves her alive.
Later he kills another man to get to that witness...
... andagainleavesher alive.
Why?
He's squeamish about killing women?
Or maybe TaIia Winters touched something in him.
Something that made Horn realize who he really was for a moment.
I think it's playing havoc with his programming.
-You almost have me believing this load.
-I'm not sure I believe it myself.
But if it's true, there should be a way to locate him.
Command?
I'd Iike to make a transmission to Ms. TaIia Winters.
Working.
-So you'II meet with me?
-Yes.
In a half-hour?
I'II look forward to it.
-Amanda, I knew you'd help me.
-AbeI, all I did was--
This is a Iong shot.
My information on Lazarus is 20 years old...
... butaccordingto thefiles...
... thecomputerpowercrystalemits a Iow level of a benign radiation.
It wouldn't ordinarily show up on the environmental scanners...
... butifwe couldreconfigure them to look for it... .
-GaribaIdi.
-Chief, Zack Allan.
Ms. Winters is requesting an escort for a business meeting in Red 7.
-With who?
-Amanda Carter.
That's a go, Zack.
Come through Red alpha.
I'II join you at Point 6.
This is trickier than I thought.
The element is definitely out-of-date.
Why not let the wizard have a go?
Now, all we have to do...
... iscross-reference with the medlab files...
... findtheupdatedelementnumber...
... logthatwithe-systems and, voila!
It's trickier than you thought.
Thanks...
... Mr.Wizard.
Ms. Winters, it's not a good idea to be roaming around the station.
I'm hardly roaming.
No, I guess not.
So, what's up?
Amanda Carter wants to pursue Taro's plan.
I don't know if I can convince futurecorp to go along...
... butifIcouId,itwouId be like a memorial for Taro.
They can kill a good man but not a good idea.
Take your time.
We'II be right here.
hello?
hello?
Ms. Carter?
Ms. Carter.
Make one sound, and I'II kill you.
That should do it.
Computer, begin scan.
Commencing.
What am I?
tell me!
I don't understand.
You're a mindbender.
You saw it in my head.
tell me what it means!
tell me!
-Pain.
Pain.
-Yes, pain!
tell me.
tell me, please.
please.
Ours now.
AII ours.
You were dying.
They operated on you, rebuilt you.
Scanned you.
There was a Psi Cop.
Scan complete.
Low-level ironium radiation detected.
Red 7, Suite 1 5.
Suite 1 5?
Amanda Carter.
GaribaIdi.
-Captain?
-Where's Ms. Winters?
Meeting with Ms. Carter in her quarters.
Our perp 's inside.
Get him, but get him alive.
I'm on my way.
Our perp's inside!
Jackson, left side.
Hansen, right.
Watch out for TaIia and remember this guy kills by touch.
Zack, Iet's get the door.
Ready?
Go.
Freeze!
I'II fry her.
I swear it.
End of the road, pal.
There's nowhere to go.
-Come on, think about it.
-Can't think.
Die when I think.
Okay, okay.
-Take it easy.
-Drop the guns.
Back off.
Do it!
You hurt her and I'II see it takes you 1 0 days to die.
I'm already dead, Mr. Security Man.
No, you aren't, Horn.
Now, just listen to me.
They are using you to betray your own world.
How do you know this?
You know it too, abel.
You can feel the machine crawling in your brain.
Get out of my way!
Let us help you.
That's all we want to do.
You let her go, and we'II help you.
You've died too many times, abel.
There's no need to die again.
Good.
Now, put the weapon down.
It was the Earthers, wasn't it?
It wasn't enough just to kill me?
We'II find out who it was together.
Just put the gun down.
Mars will never be free...
... untilthesandsrun red with Earther blood.
Thanks for ending it, Earther.
Damn it.
Captain, I'm reading a dangerous energy surge from the body.
Get her out of here.
Come on, everybody out.
Everybody out!
Come on!
Go now!
No trace.
No evidence.
I am very sorry, Ms. Winters.
abel said you knew what was wrong with him.
I was worried about him.
-I didn't think he'd harm you.
-And how does a Mars Government rep...
... knowsomuchabout a Free Mars terrorist?
abel Horn wasn't always a terrorist.
Fifteen years ago he was a bright young man...
... utterlydevotedto independence for Mars colony.
That's when I met him.
fell in love with him.
He convinced me to join Free Mars.
It wasn't a radical group at the time.
Later, when they began too become violent, I Ieft them.
I never saw AbeI again until today.
tell me another one.
You can have Ms. Winters scan me if you think I'm lying.
Besides, I've already said enough to ruin my career.
If we report it.
Are you proposing a deal, captain?
You said Taro Isogi's plan was the best hope for Mars.
-Did you mean that?
-Yes.
Then continue to negotiate with futurecorp.
Make that happen.
I doubt they'd be interested after what happened here.
I'II be glad to speak to them for you.
I'II make it clear that your government had nothing to do with the murder.
I'm sure they'II consider going ahead.
Why?
To make sure Taro Isogi's dream becomes a reality...
... andtokeepyou where you can do the most good.
Thank you.
We'II talk later.
Captain, begging your pardon, but have you gone space happy?
She is an accessory to murder and attempted murder.
Horn wasn't trying to kill me.
He wanted me to scan him.
There was something in his mind, controlling him...
-... somethinghewantedmetofind.
-And did you?
I saw an image, some sort of an operation.
well, did you recognize anything?
A location, a face, uniform?
No.
Take Ms. Winters to her quarters.
I'II help Ivanova move the traffic out.
Captain.
Mr. GaribaIdi.
Is there something?
There's a whole list.
But let's start with how you knew about the Lazarus Project.
Some people collect coins or art.
I collect secrets.
black projects, conspiracies, secret organizations.
They fascinate me.
Does one of those secrets include who was behind this thing?
-It's better you don't ask that.
-Look, captain...
... youdon'ttrustmethewayJeff used to, but if there's a threat--
The threat goes far beyond babylon 5, Mr. GaribaIdi.
I'm not surprised.
If Horn was what you say he was, then this has nothing to do with Free Mars.
To pull something like this off would take a Iot of power and a Iot of money.
And I think you know who it is.
AII right.
But promise me this information will never be repeated outside this room.
You got it.
For the past six years...
... therehavebeenrumorsaboutarogue agency operating deep inside earthgov.
A dirty-trick squad dealing in black projects and star chamber justice.
It took me over three years just to get a name.
Bureau 1 3.
And the man who gave me that name died soon after.
I am convinced they exist and that they are behind this incident.
Why?
Isogi was a danger to Earth policy on Mars.
I think his death was a warning to the other corporations.
I also think Horn was meant to destroy Free Mars from the inside...
... andpossiblyruinAmandaCarteraswell.
unfortunately...
-...
Ican'tproveany ofit.
-If this is true--
Then everything we believe in is in jeopardy.
There is a spider in the web, Mr. GaribaIdi.
And I intend to find it...
... andkillit .

Schedule Delta Wing for maintenance at 1400 and make sure Conference Room 7 is properly laid out for the Tikar delegation.
Six yarwood chairs placed precisely one meter apart in a star pattern with the hee-lok on the center chair.
Very good.
- Sheridan.
- Captain there's a problem in the ambassadorial section.
We need a command officer.
I'll handle it.
Help is on the way.
It's good to be the captain.
Isogi-san.
Talia, it's been too long.
What did you think of my NeoMars proposal?
Like all your proposals:
Too progressive, too risky and too costly in the short run.
- But if you can make it happen...
- I must make it happen.
FutureCorp has to expand beyond Earth, and Mars is the first step.
The Senate won't like it, and the Mars Conglomerate will try to bury you.
We're prepared for that.
Now I need only convince Mars to share the risk.
And if they won't?
Then their path to freedom may well be drenched with innocent blood and a long-held dream of mine will die.
Mr. Isogi?
Amanda Carter, Mars Colony Business Affairs Committee.
Ms. Carter, Ms. Talia Winters one of the finest commercial telepaths I've ever worked with.
She will be monitoring our negotiations for FutureCorp.
Ms. Winters.
Please.
I read your proposal, Mr. Isogi.
Frankly, you're either insane or a very brave man.
That's what they said of your great-grandfather, John when he volunteered to pilot the first colony ship to Mars.
So they did.
Let's talk.
Please.
- Begin by focusing more on the needs of our own people to move on to create the world that Luis Santiago...
Thirteen.
All components have arrived safely on Babylon 5.
Control is prepared to go online.
Commence operation.
The Babylon Project was our last, best hope for peace.
A self-contained world, five miles long, located in neutral territory.
A place of commerce and diplomacy for a quarter of a million humans and aliens.
A shining beacon in space, all alone in the night.
It was the dawn of the Third Age of mankind.
The year the Great War came upon us all.
This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations.
The year is 2259.
The name of the place is Babylon 5.
Sheridan.
Captain, you have a transmission from Senator Voudreau.
Patch her through.
Capt. Sheridan.
Senator, what can I do for you?
Taro Isogi, chief executive of FutureCorp has arranged a meeting on Babylon 5 with Amanda Carter a representative of the Mars Provisional Government.
Carter is an outspoken advocate of Mars independence and we suspect FutureCorp is conspiring with her to finance another rebellion on Mars Colony.
Do you have any proof?
We know FutureCorp desperately wants a foothold in space.
An exclusive trade and services agreement with Mars would give it to them if they could move the current Mars Conglomerate out.
Many of the members wanted to pull out after the last rebellion.
Another would have them running like river rats.
I understand your concern, but there's not much I can do about it.
I have no authority over corporate negotiations.
Babylon 5 is neutral territory.
Any race can negotiate here without interference, even our own.
This is a possible threat to Earth Alliance security, captain and as such, we are asking you to check it out.
Nothing official.
Just keep an eye peeled and an ear open and report anything of interest to me.
With all due respect, senator my duties as commander of B5 don't include spying on civilians.
These are volatile times, captain.
Practicality is more important than principles if lives are to be saved.
I'll expect to hear from you soon.
- Yes?
- Captain the Tikar delegation is docking.
I'll meet them in the conference room immediately.
Mars has resources the alien worlds need.
Now, they in turn can supply an economic base which will enable the colony to become self-sufficient within 10 years.
You can win your independence without bloodshed.
It will be a hard sell with the Committee.
They'll need concrete assurances from the alien worlds.
Not entirely true.
You're sure the Committee will accept your recommendation.
You're the one who needs assurance.
Yes, I do, Ms. Winters.
Mars is being ripped apart at the seams right now and before I bargain with its future, I need to know what's expected of us.
Naturally.
That's one of the reasons why I suggested Babylon 5 for this meeting.
All our prospective partners have representatives here.
We can iron out all the details to your government's satisfaction.
You actually believe you can make this work?
No, I believe we can try.
I'll speak with the Business Affairs Committee.
I think I can have an answer by tomorrow afternoon.
Very good.
She likes the idea.
She has her doubts, but basically she likes it.
And you?
Now that you've heard the details of my little plan do you also have your doubts?
Frankly, yes.
The financial risk is bad enough but the legal maneuvering will be even...
I want to hear them.
Over dinner?
I'd love to.
Well, commander, may I?
Please.
How did the conference go?
Very well, very well.
Your seating arrangement was flawless.
Latir Corvo himself complimented it.
I think we'll be seeing the Tikar on Babylon 5 soon.
I'm pleased.
They're an interesting people.
And I believe you made first contact with them.
Yes.
The Agamemnon was in an unexplored sector beyond the St. Andre Nebula when we sighted this green cloud floating in space.
Only, it wasn't a cloud at all.
It was a ship.
We hailed it, but got no response.
We moved toward it.
It moved away.
We kept that up for hours, until finally they responded.
It took our linguistics division a whole day to get even close to deciphering their language.
They'd already deciphered ours but neglected to tell us so.
Oh, a Jovian sunspot.
- You're indulging.
- I earned it.
And I'm off duty.
Please, continue.
Well, we finally broke the language barrier and introduced ourselves.
And I was invited aboard their ship.
It was incredible.
I'd never seen so much space on a starship.
And the Tikar themselves so unlike any other alien species we'd encountered.
I spent two days with them.
And what I learned in that time made me realize just how wondrous this galaxy of ours really is.
I've never seen you so excited about a deal before.
Well, it's not just a deal, Talia.
It's a step into the future.
Mars can be the beginning of a whole new life for the human species as it was meant to be.
Free Mars.
No!
Taro!
Taro.
So you have no idea what the images you got from the killer meant?
No, it was all too quick.
Just a blur of light and sound and then the blackness.
And all he said was, "Free Mars"?
Yes, but my first assignment was Mars Colony.
I scanned several Free Mars people during that time.
They're violent fanatics with a murderous hatred of Earth Alliance.
But this man was different.
There was no thought of a cause in his head, no anger no emotion of any kind, just those images.
So, what reason would Free Mars have for killing your client?
None.
Taro's proposal was a peaceful solution to the Mars problem.
Earth Central feels differently.
They believe he was going to back another rebellion on Mars.
Taro hated the violence on Mars.
He never would have done such a thing.
Someone's been lying to you, captain.
- Or to you.
- I'm a telepath.
Telepaths are human beings.
You are an old friend of Isogi's.
- You trusted him.
- With good reason.
Taro Isogi spent his life improving the lives of others.
He built a business based on that principle and he never broke a rule or harmed another to do it.
Mars was his dream, captain.
Now he's been murdered for it, and you're trying to cast the blame on him.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
I'm also tired, and I hurt.
May I go back to my quarters now?
Yes.
I'll arrange for an escort.
One escort, at your service.
This really isn't necessary.
Captain's orders.
He's worried about you, and so am I.
This gives us a chance to get to know each other better.
I've led a fascinating life.
Mr. Garibaldi, Taro Isogi was like a father to me.
I loved him as a client and as a mentor and as a friend.
And now he's dead.
You'll forgive me if I'm not in the mood for your usual badinage.
You're right.
This is a bad time for you.
I'm being a yutz.
Apology accepted.
Could you at least tell me what badinage means?
Well, my pop always said that laughter was better than pills for what ails you.
He was right.
We'll get the creep who did this.
I promise.
That won't bring Taro back, or his dreams for Mars Colony.
No.
But it will save someone else from getting killed.

Location of Talia Winters.
I want you to hold all outgoing traffic until further notice.
There's been a murder, and I don't want the killer leaving.
- Do you know who it is?
- Not yet.
But we do have an eyewitness, Talia Winters.
Was she hurt?
Fortunately not.
I think the killer wanted a witness.
Tell me.
What do you think of her?
Ms. Winters?
I think she's an interesting person.
You never describe anybody that way.
I don't really know her that well.
We've chatted from time to time.
And she's interesting.
You know how I feel about telepaths.
Do I ever!
You threw one out of a third-story window on lo.
- There was a pool below the window.
- I'll assume you knew that.
Aside from Ms. Winters' "interesting" quality do you think she can be trusted?
Yes, except she's very loyal to Psi Corps.
And you don't trust Psi Corps?
No.
Do you?
Telepaths are gifted and cursed in ways I can never hope to understand.
But they're still human beings, good, bad or indifferent.
No.
I trust in individuals, not organizations.
Then you may trust Ms. Winters.
Come in.
Ms. Carter, I'm Capt. John Sheridan, commander of Babylon 5.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about your meeting with Taro Isogi.
I'm afraid I must decline, captain.
Private negotiations are not subject to Earthforce scrutiny.
In this case, they are.
Mr. Isogi was murdered last night.
What?
Who could...?
According to an eyewitness, the killer said, "Free Mars."
Free Mars?
Yes.
No, that can't be.
There's no way they could have known about this meeting.
And even if they did, they had nothing to gain by killing Mr. Isogi.
Taro was working to achieve a peaceful compromise that would ensure the colony's independence without bloodshed.
Somebody obviously didn't like it.
Damn them.
Any idea who "they" might be?
The Senate, Mars Conglomerate.
They'd be the most opposed.
I never thought they'd go this far.
Thank you for your time, Ms. Carter.
I may have more questions for you later.
I'll be glad to help.
Whoever killed Taro Isogi killed Mars' best hope for the future.
What have you come up with?
Forensics said Isogi's body was hit with a massive electrical charge.
Disrupted every cell in his body.
There's scorch marks on his throat that show the outline of fingers but no prints or striations of any kind.
A slaver's glove?
No.
I mean, they pack a jolt but not enough to do this much damage.
No, this is high-tech and definitely not standard Free Mars issue.
My guess is some sort of prosthetic weaponry.
What I can't figure is how he got it on station.
A power source that would generate that big a charge should show up on scanners.
Maybe he had some special help.
You want to explain that?
Not until we have more to go on.
Keep an escort on Ms. Winters and intensify the search.
Include EarthGov and Corp secure areas.
Will do.
Captain?
I'd like to know where you're going with this.
Someplace very dark.
I hope to God I'm wrong.
Hey, Earther!
Free Mars.
No.
Help!
Help me, somebody!
What have they done to me?
The images in his mind were the same as before except this time I saw an Earth Alliance ship.
A big one.
A cruiser, I think.
It was firing at him.
And I know this sounds crazy.
But it hit him, and he died.
Died?
It was as if he were reliving the thought of his death over and over again clinging to it as if it were the only thought he had.
Captain, I've got an ID on our perp.
I checked the DNA in the hair that Ms. Winters pulled out.
It's positive.
Take a look.
- That's him.
- He's Free Mars, all right.
One of their leaders in fact.
Name's Abel Horn.
- Abel Horn?
- Do you know him?
In a way.
My wife, Anna, and I had some very special friends on Mars.
They worked at Ritchey Station.
They were there when Free Mars blew it.
Abel Horn claimed responsibility for it.
I want him, Mr. Garibaldi.
So do I, but there's a problem.
According to Earthforce Intelligence, Abel Horn is dead.
A cruiser scragged his ship over Phobos during the rebellion.
Oh, my God.
Is that what you saw in his mind?
Yes.
Would someone tell me what the hell we're talking about?
Sir?
Later.
Right now I want her in protective custody and a fugitive alert posted on Horn.
Done.
Ms. Winters.
Amanda.
It's been a long time.
I thought you were dead.
Damn near.
Earthers blew me up over Phobos.
Your old buddy Singer found me, got me out.
A snakehead doc fixed me up.
I've been hiding in the Tigris Sector ever since.
Then I got word you were coming here.
- Why did you kill Taro Isogi?
- Who?
The man I came here to meet.
They say you killed him.
There's a fugitive alert out for you.
They're lying.
I haven't killed anyone.
I came here to see you.
I have to get back to Mars, and you're the only one who can help me.
I can't do that, Abel.
I am finally in a position to help with Mars independence.
If anyone found out I was once a member of Free Mars...
Which just might come out if they were to catch me here.
You came here to blackmail me into smuggling you back to Mars?
That was never your style, Abel.
I've changed.
Abel, what's wrong?
Abel!
Amanda, please.
Have to... help me!
Help me!
Did something to... to me.
Telepath knows.
Talia Winters saw it in my head!
Have to find her!
- Lose, lose, lose, lose, losing control!
- Stop!
Stop!
There's one way in, and I have a detail on it.
It'll take an army to get in.
If you need to go somewhere, call the guard post and they'll assign an escort.
Try to relax, enjoy yourself.
We'll take care of this guy.
Mr. Garibaldi?
I was just going to make a cup of tea to soothe my nerves.
Would you like one?
Well, since I am chief of Security, I guess seeing you're secure is my job.
And tea just happens to be my third favorite thing in the universe.
I needed this yesterday.
The captain of the Matheson is demanding an update on his departure.
Tell him to go away.
Tell them all to go away.
- How's it going?
- We've had 20 complaints six formal protests and one threat, all in the last hour.
The natives are restless.
Start moving them out.
What about the murderer?
I don't think he's trying to leave yet.
But have every ship searched.
I'll be in my quarters.
There's something I want to check out.
So then my pop says to the guy, "Fifty credits for a salami?
I could've killed you for 20."
- Your father was quite a character.
- He was the best.
He cooked like an angel, swore like the devil, taught me everything about security.
He could spot a crook a sector away, and he was still hauling them in at 75.
Then he got Torg's Syndrome and just kind of faded away.
I sure miss him.
I never really knew my father or my mother.
I was raised by Psi Corps from the time I was 5.
- Of course, there was Abby.
- Abby?
She was my support during my first year at the Center.
When telepaths first come, a senior telepath guides them through the program.
The first day I was crying all the time.
I was scared and confused and hurting.
And then Abby came.
She held me for a very long time, never saying a word.
I didn't know it then, but she was scanning me, ever so gently.
And little by little, the pain and fear and confusion melted.
And all that was left was this warm, safe place in my mind.
It was wonderful.
But the next year Abby was assigned to another newcomer.
Garibaldi.
Mr. Garibaldi, please report to my quarters.
On my way.
Sorry.
Mr. Garibaldi.
Thank you.
My pleasure, Ms. Winters.
Come.
Mr. Garibaldi, take a look at this.
Project Lazarus?
Never heard of it.
It was part of Earthforce's cyber experiments back in the late '30s.
The cyber experiments were a bust.
Humans couldn't function with machines in their brains.
- Correct.
That's why they decided to use subjects on the verge of death:
Accident victims, wounded soldiers, people in comas...
You're kidding?
That's grotesque.
It gets even better.
The theory was to hardwire the subject's brain with a computer intelligence.
It kept the brain functional while the body was repaired.
Then using telepathic deep-scan the subject was fixated on the moment of his death shutting down all conscious thought.
The computer takes complete control while the subject is dying over and over again in his subconscious.
Ms. Winters said that Horn was clinging to the thought of his death as if it were the only thought he had.
Hold on.
Are you saying Horn is one of these cyber zombies?
I'm saying he might be.
His body could have been recovered after the blast.
Or Intelligence was wrong again, and Horn was never in the ship that was blasted.
Well, that's the simple explanation.
And ordinarily I'd accept it, but this isn't a simple thing.
A known Free Mars terrorist kills a man in front of a witness and leaves her alive.
Later he kills another man to get to that witness and again leaves her alive.
Why?
He's squeamish about killing women?
Or maybe Talia Winters touched something in him.
Something that made Horn realize who he really was for a moment.
I think it's playing havoc with his programming.
- You almost have me believing this load.
- I'm not sure I believe it myself.
But if it's true, there should be a way to locate him.
Command?
I'd like to make a transmission to Ms. Talia Winters.
Working.
- So you'll meet with me?
- Yes.
In a half-hour?
I'll look forward to it.
- Amanda, I knew you'd help me.
- Abel, all I did was...
This is a long shot.
My information on Lazarus is 20 years old but according to the files the computer power crystal emits a low level of a benign radiation.
It wouldn't ordinarily show up on the environmental scanners but if we could reconfigure them to look for it...
- Garibaldi.
- Chief, Zack Allan.
Ms. Winters is requesting an escort for a business meeting in Red 7.
- With who?
- Amanda Carter.
That's a go, Zack.
Come through Red Alpha.
I'll join you at Point 6.
This is trickier than I thought.
The element is definitely out-of-date.
Why not let the wizard have a go?
Now, all we have to do is cross-reference with the Medlab files find the updated element number log that with e-systems and, voilà!
It's trickier than you thought.
Thanks Mr. Wizard.
Ms. Winters, it's not a good idea to be roaming around the station.
I'm hardly roaming.
No, I guess not.
So, what's up?
Amanda Carter wants to pursue Taro's plan.
I don't know if I can convince FutureCorp to go along but if I could, it would be like a memorial for Taro.
They can kill a good man but not a good idea.
Take your time.
We'll be right here.
Hello?
Hello?
Ms. Carter?
Ms. Carter.
Make one sound, and I'll kill you.
That should do it.
Computer, begin scan.
Commencing.
What am I?
Tell me!
I don't understand.
You're a mindbender.
You saw it in my head.
Tell me what it means!
Tell me!
- Pain.
Pain.
- Yes, pain!
Tell me.
Tell me, please.
Please.
Ours now.
All ours.
You were dying.
They operated on you, rebuilt you.
Scanned you.
There was a Psi Cop.
Scan complete.
Low-level ironium radiation detected.
Red 7, Suite 15.
Suite 15?
Amanda Carter.
Garibaldi.
- Captain?
- Where's Ms. Winters?
Meeting with Ms. Carter in her quarters.
Our perp 's inside.
Get him, but get him alive.
I'm on my way.
Our perp's inside!
Jackson, left side.
Hansen, right.
Watch out for Talia and remember this guy kills by touch.
Zack, let's get the door.
Ready?
Go.
Freeze!
I'll fry her.
I swear it.
End of the road, pal.
There's nowhere to go.
- Come on, think about it.
- Can't think.
Die when I think.
Okay, okay.
- Take it easy.
- Drop the guns.
Back off.
Do it!
You hurt her and I'll see it takes you 10 days to die.
I'm already dead, Mr. Security Man.
No, you aren't, Horn.
Now, just listen to me.
They are using you to betray your own world.
How do you know this?
You know it too, Abel.
You can feel the machine crawling in your brain.
Get out of my way!
Let us help you.
That's all we want to do.
You let her go, and we'll help you.
You've died too many times, Abel.
There's no need to die again.
Good.
Now, put the weapon down.
It was the Earthers, wasn't it?
It wasn't enough just to kill me?
We'll find out who it was together.
Just put the gun down.
Mars will never be free until the sands run red with Earther blood.
Thanks for ending it, Earther.
Damn it.
Captain, I'm reading a dangerous energy surge from the body.
Get her out of here.
Come on, everybody out.
Everybody out!
Come on!
Go now!
No trace.
No evidence.
I am very sorry, Ms. Winters.
Abel said you knew what was wrong with him.
I was worried about him.
- I didn't think he'd harm you.
- And how does a Mars Government rep know so much about a Free Mars terrorist?
Abel Horn wasn't always a terrorist.
Fifteen years ago he was a bright young man utterly devoted to independence for Mars Colony.
That's when I met him.
Fell in love with him.
He convinced me to join Free Mars.
It wasn't a radical group at the time.
Later, when they began too become violent, I left them.
I never saw Abel again until today.
Tell me another one.
You can have Ms. Winters scan me if you think I'm lying.
Besides, I've already said enough to ruin my career.
If we report it.
Are you proposing a deal, captain?
You said Taro Isogi's plan was the best hope for Mars.
- Did you mean that?
- Yes.
Then continue to negotiate with FutureCorp.
Make that happen.
I doubt they'd be interested after what happened here.
I'll be glad to speak to them for you.
I'll make it clear that your government had nothing to do with the murder.
I'm sure they'll consider going ahead.
Why?
To make sure Taro Isogi's dream becomes a reality and to keep you where you can do the most good.
Thank you.
We'll talk later.
Captain, begging your pardon, but have you gone space happy?
She is an accessory to murder and attempted murder.
Horn wasn't trying to kill me.
He wanted me to scan him.
There was something in his mind, controlling him something he wanted me to find.
- And did you?
I saw an image, some sort of an operation.
Well, did you recognize anything?
A location, a face, uniform?
No.
Take Ms. Winters to her quarters.
I'll help lvanova move the traffic out.
Captain.
Mr. Garibaldi.
Is there something?
There's a whole list.
But let's start with how you knew about the Lazarus Project.
Some people collect coins or art.
I collect secrets.
Black projects, conspiracies, secret organizations.
They fascinate me.
Does one of those secrets include who was behind this thing?
- It's better you don't ask that.
- Look, captain you don't trust me the way Jeff used to, but if there's a threat...
The threat goes far beyond Babylon 5, Mr. Garibaldi.
I'm not surprised.
If Horn was what you say he was, then this has nothing to do with Free Mars.
To pull something like this off would take a lot of power and a lot of money.
And I think you know who it is.
All right.
But promise me this information will never be repeated outside this room.
You got it.
For the past six years there have been rumors about a rogue agency operating deep inside EarthGov.
A dirty-trick squad dealing in black projects and star chamber justice.
It took me over three years just to get a name.
Bureau 13.
And the man who gave me that name died soon after.
I am convinced they exist and that they are behind this incident.
Why?
Isogi was a danger to Earth policy on Mars.
I think his death was a warning to the other corporations.
I also think Horn was meant to destroy Free Mars from the inside and possibly ruin Amanda Carter as well.
Unfortunately I can't prove any of it.
- If this is true...
Then everything we believe in is in jeopardy.
There is a spider in the web, Mr. Garibaldi.
And I intend to find it and kill it.
Thirteen.
Report from Babylon 5 Control.
Mission only partly successful.
Isogi terminated but unit was destroyed before he could leave station for Mars.
Is the Bureau at hazard?
Control does not believe so.
Belief is not enough.
He is to follow up until he is certain.
Thirteen out.

Babylon 5, produced by Babylonian Productions, Inc and distributed by Warner Bros. Domestic TV Distribution.
Schedule Delta Wing for maintenance at 1400... and make sure Conference Room 7 is properly laid out for the Tikar delegation.
Six yarwood chairs placed precisely one meter apart in a star pattern... with the hee-lok on the center chair.
Very good.
- Sheridan.
- Captain there's a problem... in the ambassadorial section.
They're asking for a command officer.
I'll handle it.
Help is on the way.
It's good to be the captain.
Isogi-san.
Talia, it's been too long.
What did you think of my NeoMars proposal?
It's like all your proposals:
too progressive, too risky and too costly in the short run.
- But if you can make it happen...
- I must make it happen.
FutureCorp has to expand beyond Earth, and Mars is the first step.
The Senate won't like it, and the Mars Conglomerate will try to bury you.
We're prepared for that.
Now I need only convince Mars to share the risk.
And if they won't?
Then their path to freedom may well be drenched with innocent blood... and a long-held dream of mine will die.
Mr. Isogi?
Amanda Carter, Mars Colony Business Affairs Committee.
Ms. Carter, Ms. Talia Winters... one of the finest commercial telepaths I've ever worked with.
She will be monitoring our negotiations for FutureCorp.
Ms. Winters.
Please.
I read your proposal, Mr. Isogi.
Frankly, you're either insane or a very brave man.
I can well imagine that's what they said of your great-grandfather, John... when he volunteered to pilot the first colony ship to Mars.
So they did.
Let's talk.
Please.
Begin by focusing more on the needs of our own people... to move on to create the world that Luis Santiago...
Thirteen.
All components have arrived safely on Babylon 5.
Control is prepared to go online.
Commence operation.
The Babylon Project was our last, best hope for peace.
A self-contained world, five miles long, located in neutral territory.
A place of commerce and diplomacy... for a quarter of a million humans and aliens.
A shining beacon in space, all alone in the night.
It was the dawn of the Third Age of mankind.
The year the Great War came upon us all.
This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations.
The year is 2259.
The name of the place is Babylon 5.

BABYLON 5 2x06 "SPIDER IN THE WEB"
Captain, you have a transmission from Senator Voudreau.
Patch her through.
Capt. Sheridan.
Senator, what can I do for you?
Taro Isogi, chief executive of FutureCorp... has arranged a meeting on Babylon 5 with Amanda Carter... a representative of the Mars Provisional Government.
Carter is an outspoken advocate of Mars independence... and we suspect FutureCorp is conspiring with her... to finance another rebellion on Mars Colony.
Do you have any proof?
We know FutureCorp desperately wants a foothold in space.
An exclusive trade and services agreement with Mars would give it to them... if they could move the current Mars Conglomerate out.
Many of the members wanted to pull out after the last rebellion.
Another would have them running like river rats.
I understand your concern, but there's not much I can do about it.
I have no authority over corporate negotiations.
Babylon 5 is neutral territory.
Any race can negotiate here without interference, even our own.
This is a possible threat to Earth Alliance security, captain... and as such, we are asking you to check it out.
Nothing official.
Just keep an eye peeled and an ear open... and report anything of interest to me.
With all due respect, senator... my duties as commander of B5 don't include spying on civilians.
These are volatile times, captain.
Practicality is more important than principles if lives are to be saved.
I'll expect to hear from you soon.
- Yes?
- Captain... the Tikar delegation is docking.
I'll meet them in the conference room immediately.
Mars has resources the alien worlds need.
Now, they in turn can supply an economic base... which will enable the colony to become self-sufficient within 10 years.
You can win your independence without bloodshed.
It will be a hard sell with the Committee.
They'll need concrete assurances from the alien worlds.
Not entirely true.
You're pretty sure the Committee will accept your recommendation.
And you're the one who needs the assurance.
Yes, I do, Ms. Winters.
Mars is being ripped apart at the seams right now... and before I bargain with its future, I need to know what's expected of us.
Naturally.
That's one of the reasons why...
I suggested Babylon 5 for this meeting.
All our prospective partners have representatives here.
Now, we can iron out all the details to your government's satisfaction.
You actually believe you can make this work?
No, I believe we can try.
I'll speak with the Business Affairs Committee.
I think I can have an answer for you by tomorrow afternoon.
Very good.
She likes the idea.
She has her doubts, but basically she likes it.
And you?
Now that you've heard the details of my little plan... do you also have your doubts?
Frankly, yes.
The financial risk is bad enough... but the legal maneuvering will be even-
I want to hear them.
Over dinner?
I'd love to.
Well, commander, may I?
Please.
How did the conference go?
Very well, very well.
Your seating arrangement was flawless.
Latir Corvo himself complimented it.
I think we'll be seeing the Tikar on Babylon 5 soon.
I'm pleased.
They're an interesting people.
And I believe you made first contact with them.
Yes.
The Agamemnon was in an unexplored sector beyond the St. Andre Nebula... when we sighted this green cloud floating in space.
Only, it wasn't a cloud at all.
It was a ship.
We hailed it, but got no response.
We moved toward it.
It moved away.
We kept that up for hours, until finally they responded.
It took our linguistics division a whole day... to get even close to deciphering their language.
They'd already deciphered ours but neglected to tell us so.
Oh, a Jovian sunspot.
You're indulging.
I earned it.
And I'm off duty.
Please, continue.
Well, we finally broke the language barrier and introduced ourselves.
And I was invited aboard their ship.
It was incredible.
I'd never seen so much space on a starship.
And the Tikar themselves... so unlike any other alien species we'd encountered.
I spent two days with them.
And what I learned in that time... made me realize just how wondrous this galaxy of ours really is.
I've never seen you so excited about a deal before.
Well, it's not just a deal, Talia.
It's a step into the future.
Mars can be the beginning of a whole new life for the human species... as it was meant to be.
Free Mars.
No!
Taro!
Taro.
Taro.
Taro.
So you have no idea... what the images you got from the killer meant?
No, it was all too quick.
Just a blur of light and sound and then the blackness.
And all he said was, "Free Mars"?
Yes, but my first assignment was Mars Colony.
I scanned several Free Mars people during that time.
They're violent fanatics with a murderous hatred of Earth Alliance.
But this man was different.
There was no thought of a cause in his head, no anger... no emotion of any kind, just those images.
So, what reason would Free Mars have for killing your client?
None.
Taro's proposal was a peaceful solution to the Mars problem.
Earth Central feels differently.
They believe he was going to back another rebellion on Mars.
Taro hated the violence on Mars.
He never would have done such a thing.
Someone's been lying to you, captain.
- Or to you.
- I'm a telepath.
Telepaths are human beings.
You are an old friend of Isogi's.
- You trusted him.
- With good reason.
Taro Isogi spent his life improving the lives of others.
He built a business based on that principle... and he never broke a rule or harmed another to do it.
Mars was his dream, captain.
Now he's been murdered for it, and you're trying to cast the blame on him.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
I'm also tired, and I hurt.
May I go back to my quarters now?
Yes.
I'll arrange for an escort.
One escort, at your service.
This really isn't necessary.
Captain's orders.
He's worried about you, and so am I.
Besides, this gives us a chance to get to know each other better.
I've led a fascinating life.
Mr. Garibaldi, Taro Isogi was like a father to me.
I loved him as a client and as a mentor and as a friend.
And now he's dead.
You'll forgive me if I'm not in the mood for your usual badinage.
You're right.
This is a bad time for you.
I'm being a yutz.
Apology accepted.
Could you at least tell me what badinage means?
Well, my pop always said that laughter was better than pills for what ails you.
He was right.
We'll get the creep who did this.
I promise.
That won't bring Taro back, or his dreams for Mars Colony.
No.
But it will save someone else from getting killed.

Understood.

Location of Talia Winters.
I want you to hold all outgoing traffic until further notice.
There's been a murder, and I don't want the killer jump off the station.
- Do you know who it is?
- Not yet.
But we do have an eyewitness, Talia Winters.
Was she hurt?
Fortunately not.
I think the killer wanted a witness.
Tell me.
What do you think of her?
Ms. Winters?
I think she's an interesting person.
You never describe anybody that way.
I don't really know her that well.
We've chatted from time to time.
And she's interesting.
You know how I feel about telepaths.
Do I ever!
You threw one out of a third-story window on Io.
- There was an ample pool below the window.
- I'll assume you knew that.
Aside from Ms. Winters' "interesting" quality... do you think she can be trusted?
Yes, except... she's very loyal to Psi Corps.
And you don't trust Psi Corps?
No.
Do you?
Telepaths are gifted and cursed in ways I can never hope to understand.
But they're still human beings, good, bad or indifferent.
No.
I trust in individuals, not organizations.
Then you may trust Ms. Winters.
Come in.
Ms. Carter, I'm Capt. John Sheridan, commander of Babylon 5.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about your meeting with Taro Isogi.
I'm afraid I must decline, captain.
Private negotiations are not subject to Earthforce scrutiny.
In this case, they are.
Mr. Isogi was murdered last night.
What?
Who could-?
According to an eyewitness, the killer said: "Free Mars. "
- Free Mars?
- Yes.
No, that can't be.
There's no way they could have known about this meeting.
And even if they did, they had nothing to gain by killing Mr. Isogi.
Taro was working to achieve a peaceful compromise... that would ensure the colony's independence... without bloodshed.
Somebody obviously didn't like it.
Damn them.
Any idea who "they" might be?
The Senate, Mars Conglomerate.
They'd be the most opposed.
I never thought they'd go this far.
Thank you for your time, Ms. Carter.
I may have some aditional questions for you later.
I'll be glad to help.
Whoever killed Taro Isogi killed Mars' best hope for the future.
What have you come up with?
Forensics said Isogi's body was hit with a massive electrical charge.
Disrupted every cell in his body.
There's scorch marks on his throat that show the outline of fingers... but no prints or striations of any kind.
A slaver's glove?
No.
I mean, they pack a jolt but not enough to do this much damage.
No, this is high-tech... and definitely not standard Free Mars issue.
My guess is some sort of prosthetic weaponry.
What I can't figure is how he got it on station.
A power source that would generate that big a charge should show up on scanners.
Maybe he had some special help.
You want to explain that?
Not until we have more to go on.
Keep an escort on Ms. Winters and intensify the search.
Include EarthGov and Corp secure areas.
Will do.
Captain?
I'd sure like to know where you're going with this.
Someplace very dark.
And I hope to God I'm wrong.
Hey, Earther!
Free Mars.
No.
Help!
Help me, somebody!
What have they done to me?
The images in his mind were the same as before except... this time I saw an Earth Alliance ship.
A big one.
A cruiser, I think.
It was firing at him.
And I know this sounds crazy.
But it hit him, and he died.
Died?
It was as if he were reliving the thought of his death over and over again... clinging to it as if it were the only thought he had.
Captain, I've got an ID on our perp.
I checked the DNA in the hair that Ms. Winters pulled out of his head.
It's positive.
Take a look.
- That's him.
- He's Free Mars, all right.
One of their leaders in fact.
Name's Abel Horn.
- Abel Horn?
- Do you know him?
In a way.
My wife Anna and I had some very special friends on Mars.
They worked at Ritchey Station.
They were there when Free Mars blew it.
Abel Horn claimed responsibility for it.
I want him, Mr. Garibaldi.
So do I, but there's a problem.
According to Earthforce Intelligence, Abel Horn is dead.
A cruiser scragged his ship over Phobos during the rebellion.
Oh, My God.
Is that what you saw in his mind?
Yes.
Would someone tell me what the hell we're talking about?
Sir?
Later.
Right now I want her in protective custody and a fugitive alert posted on Horn.
Done.
Ms. Winters.
Amanda.
It's been a long time.
I thought you were dead.
Damn near.
Earthers blew me up over Phobos.
Your old buddy Singer found me, got me out.
A snakehead doc fixed me up.
I've been hiding in the Tigris Sector ever since.
Then I got word you were coming here.
- Why did you kill Taro Isogi?
- Who?
The man I came here to meet.
They say you killed him.
There's a fugitive alert out for you.
They're lying.
I haven't killed anyone.
I came here to see you.
I have to get back to Mars, and you're the only one who can help me.
I can't do that, Abel.
I am finally in a position to help with Mars independence.
If anyone found out I was once a member of Free Mars-
Which just might come out if they were to catch me here.
You came here to blackmail me into smuggling you back to Mars?
That was never your style, Abel.
I've changed.
Abel, what's wrong?
Abel!
Amanda, please.
Have to... help me!
Help me!
Did something to... to me.
Telepath knows.
Talia Winters... saw it in my head!
Have to find her!
- Lose, lose, lose, lose, losing control!
- Stop!
Stop!
There's one way in here, and I have a full detail on it.
It'll take an army to get to you.
If you need to go somewhere, call the guard post and they'll assign an escort.
Try to relax, enjoy yourself.
We'll take care of this guy.
Mr. Garibaldi?
I was just going to make a cup of tea to soothe my nerves.
Would you like one?
Well, since I am chief of Security, I guess seeing you're secure is my job.
And tea just happens to be my third favorite thing in the universe.
I needed this yesterday.
Commander, the captain of the Matheson is demanding an update on his departure.
Tell him to go away.
Tell them all to go away.
- How's it going?
- We've had 20 complaints... six formal protests and one outright threat, all in the last hour.
The natives are very restless.
Start moving them out.
What about the murderer?
I don't think he's trying to leave yet.
But have every ship searched.
I'll be in my quarters.
There's something I want to check out.
So then my pop says to the guy, "Fifty credits for a salami?
I could've killed you for 20."
- Your father was quite a character.
- He was the best.
He cooked like an angel, swore like the devil... and taught me everything I know about security.
He'll make a spot a crook a sector away, and he was still hauling them in at 75.
Then he got Torg's Syndrome and just kind of faded away.
I sure miss him.
I never really knew my father or my mother.
I was raised by Psi Corps from the time I was 5.
- Of course, there was Abby.
- Abby?
She was my support during my first year at the Center.
When telepaths first come, they are assigned a senior telepath... to guide them through the early stages of the program.
The first day I was crying all the time.
I was scared and confused and hurting.
And then Abby came.
She held me for a very long time, never saying a word.
I didn't know it then, but she was scanning me, ever so gently.
And little by little, the pain and fear and confusion melted.
And all that was left was this warm, safe place in my mind.
It was wonderful.
But the next year Abby was assigned to another newcomer.
Garibaldi.
Mr. Garibaldi, please report to my quarters.
On my way.
Sorry.
Mr. Garibaldi.
Thank you.
My pleasure, Ms. Winters.
Come.
Mr. Garibaldi, take a look at this.
Project Lazarus?
Never heard of it.
It was part of Earthforce's cyber experiments back in the late '30s.
Most of the cyber experiments were a bust.
Humans couldn't function...
- ... with machines in their brains.
- Correct.
That's why they came up with the idea of using subjects on the verge of death:
Accident victims, wounded soldiers, people in comas-
You're kidding?
That's grotesque.
It gets even better.
The theory was to hardwire the subject's brain with a computer intelligence.
It kept the brain functional while the body was repaired.
Then using telepathic deep-scan... the subject was fixated on the moment of his death... shutting down all conscious thought.
The computer takes complete control... while the subject is dying over and over again in his subconscious.
Ms. Winters said that Horn was clinging to the thought of his death... as if it were the only thought he had.
Wow, hold on.
Are you saying Horn is one of these cyber zombies?
I'm saying he might be.
His body could have been recovered after the blast.
Or Intelligence was wrong again, and Horn was never in the ship that was blasted.
Well, that's the simple explanation.
And ordinarily I'd accept it, but this isn't a simple thing.
A known Free Mars terrorist kills a man... in front of a witness and leaves her alive.
Later he kills another man to get to that witness... and again leaves her alive.
Why?
Maybe he's squeamish about killing women?
Or maybe Talia Winters touched something in him.
Something that made Horn realize who he really was for a moment.
I think it's playing havoc with his programming.
- You almost have me believing this load.
- I'm not sure I believe it myself.
But if it's true, there should be a way to locate him.
Command?
I'd like to make a transmission to Ms. Talia Winters.
Working.
- So you'll meet with me?
- Yes.
In a half hour?
I'll look forward to it.
- Amanda, I knew you'd help me.
- Abel, all I did was-
This is a long shot.
My information on Lazarus is 20 years old... but according to the files... the computer power crystal emits a low level of a benign radiation.
It wouldn't ordinarily show up on the environmental scanners... but if we could reconfigure them to look for it...
- Garibaldi.
- Chief, Zack Allan.
Ms. Winters is requesting an escort for a business meeting in Red 7.
- With who?
- Amanda Carter.
That's a go, Zack.
Come through Red Alpha.
I'll join you at Point 6.
This is trickier than I thought.
The element is definitely out-of-date.
Why not let the wizard have a go?
Now, all we have to do... is cross-reference with the Medlab files... find the updated element number... log that with e-systems and, voilá!
It's trickier than you thought.
Thanks...
Mr. Wizard.
Ms. Winters, it's not a good idea to be roaming around the station.
I'm hardly roaming.
No, I guess not.
So, what's up?
Amanda Carter wants to pursue Taro's plan.
I don't know if I can convince FutureCorp to go along... but if I could, it would be like a memorial for Taro.
They can kill a good man but not a good idea.
Take your time.
We'll be right here.
Hello?
Hello?
Ms. Carter?
Ms. Carter.
Make one sound, and I'll kill you.
That should do it.
Computer, begin scan.
Commencing.
What am I?
Tell me!
I don't understand.
You're a mindbender.
You saw it in my head.
Tell me what it means!
Tell me!
- Pain.
Pain.
- Yes, pain!
Tell me.
Tell me, please.
Please.
Ours now.
All ours.
You were dying.
They operated on you, rebuilt you.
Scanned you.
There was a Psi Corp.

Amanda Carter.
Garibaldi.
- Captain?
- Where's Ms. Winters?
Meeting with Ms. Carter in her quarters.
Our perp's inside.
Get him, but get him alive.
I'm on my way.
Dam!
Our perp's inside!
Jackson, left side.
Hansen, right.
Watch out for Talia and remember this guy kills by touch.
Zack, let's get the door.
Ready?
Go.
Freeze!
I'll fry her.
I swear it.
End of the road, pal.
There's nowhere to go.
- Come on, think about it.
- Can't think.
Die when I think.
Okay, okay.
- Take it easy.
- Drop the guns.
Back off.
Do it!
You hurt that lady and I'll see it takes you 10 days to die.
I'm already dead, Mr. Security Man.
No, you aren't, Horn.
Now, just listen to me.
They are using you to betray your own world.
How do you know this?
You know it too, Abel.
You can feel the machine crawling in your brain.
Get out of my way!
Let us help you.
That's all we want to do.
You let her go, and we'll help you.
You've died too many times, Abel.
There's no need to die again.
Good.
Now, put the weapon down.
It was the Earthers, wasn't it?
It wasn't enough just to kill me?
We'll find out who it was together.
Just put the gun down.
Mars will never be free... until the sands run red with Earther blood.
Thanks for ending it, Earther.
Damn it.
Captain, I'm reading a dangerous energy surge from the body.
Get her out of here.
Come on, everybody out.
Everybody out!
Come on!
Go now!
No trace.
No evidence.
I am very sorry, Ms. Winters.
Abel said you knew what was wrong with him.
I was worried about him.
I never thought he'd try to harm you.
And how does a Mars Government rep... know so much about a Free Mars terrorist?
Abel Horn wasn't always a terrorist.
Fifteen years ago he was a bright young man... utterly devoted to independence for Mars Colony.
That's when I met him.
Fell in love with him.
He convinced me to join Free Mars.
It wasn't a radical group at the time.
Later, when they began to become violent, I left them.
I never saw Abel again until today.
Tell me another one.
You can have Ms. Winters scan me if you think I'm lying.
Besides, I've already said enough to ruin my career.
If we report it.
Are you proposing a deal, captain?
You said Taro Isogi's plan was the best hope for Mars.
- Did you mean that?
- Yes.
Then continue to negotiate with FutureCorp.
Make that happen.
I doubt they'd be interested after what happened here.
I'll be glad to speak to them for you.
I'll make it clear that your government had nothing to do with the murder.
I'm sure they'll consider going ahead.
Why?
To make sure Taro Isogi's dream becomes a reality... and to keep you where you can do the most good.
Thank you.
We'll talk later.
Captain, begging your pardon, but have you gone space happy?
That woman is an accessory to murder and attempted murder.
Horn wasn't trying to kill me.
He wanted me to scan him.
There was something in his mind, controlling him...
- ... something he wanted me to find.
- And did you?
I saw an image, some sort of an operation.
Well, did you recognize anything?
A location, a face, uniform?
No.
Take Ms. Winters to her quarters.
I'll help Ivanova move the traffic out.
Captain.
Mr. Garibaldi.
- Is there something?
- There's a whole list.
But let's start with how you knew about the Lazarus Project.
Some people collect coins or art.
I collect secrets.
Black projects, conspiracies, secret organizations.
They fascinate me.
Does one of those secrets include who was behind this thing?
- It's better you don't ask that.
- Look, captain...
I know you don't trust me the way Jeff used to, but if there's a threat to this station-
The threat goes far beyond Babylon 5, Mr. Garibaldi.
I'm not surprised.
If Horn was what you say he was, then this has nothing to do with Free Mars.
To pull something like this off would take a lot of power and a lot of money.
And I think you know who it is.
All right.
But promise me this information will never be repeated outside this room.
You got it.
For the past six years... there have been rumors about a rogue agency operating deep inside EarthGov.
A dirty-trick squad dealing in black projects and star chamber justice.
It took me over three years just to get a name.
Bureau 13.
And the man who gave me that name died soon after.
I am convinced they exist and that they are behind this incident.
Why?
Isogi was a danger to Earth policy on Mars.
I think his death was a warning to the other corporations.
I also think Horn was meant to destroy Free Mars from the inside... and possibly ruin Amanda Carter as well.
Unfortunately...
- ...
I can't prove any of it.
- If this is true-
Then everything we believe in is in jeopardy.
There is a spider in the web, Mr. Garibaldi.
And I intend to find it... and kill it.
Thirteen.
Report from Babylon 5 Control.
Mission only partly successful.
Isogi terminated but unit was destroyed... before he could leave station for Mars.
Is the Bureau at hazard?
Control does not believe so.
Belief is not enough.
He is to follow up until he is certain.
Thirteen out.

-Sheridan.
-"Captain..."
...there's a problem in the ambassadorial section.
We need a command officer.
I'll handle it.
Help is on the way.
It's good to be the captain.
Isogi-san.
Talia, it's been too long.
What did you think of my NeoMars proposal?
It's like all your proposals: too progressive, too risky and too costly in the short run.
-But if you can make it happen....
-I must make it happen.
FutureCorp has to expand beyond Earth, and Mars is the first step.
The Senate won't like it, and the Mars Conglomerate will try to bury you.
We're prepared for that.
Now I need only convince Mars to share the risk.
And if they won't?
Then their path to freedom may well be drenched with innocent blood and a long-held dream of mine will die.
Mr. Isogi?
Amanda Carter, Mars Colony Business Affairs Committee.
Ms. Carter, Ms. Talia Winters one of the finest commercial telepaths I've ever worked with.
She will be monitoring our negotiations for FutureCorp.
Ms. Winters.
Please.
I read your proposal, Mr. Isogi.
Frankly, you're either insane or a very brave man.
That's what they said of your great-grandfather, John when he volunteered to pilot the first colony ship to Mars.
So they did.
Let's talk.
Please.
--"begin by focusing more on the needs" of our own people to move on to create the world that Luis Santiago....
Thirteen.
All components have arrived safely on Babylon 5.
Control is prepared to go online.
Commence operation.
The Babylon Project was our last, best hope for peace.
"A self"-"contained world, five miles long," located in neutral territory.
A place of commerce and diplomacy for a quarter of a million humans and aliens.
A shining beacon in space, all alone in the night.
It was the dawn of the Third Age of mankind.
The year the Great War came upon us all.
This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations.
The year is 2259.
The name of the place is Babylon 5.
Sheridan.
Captain, you have a transmission from Senator Voudreau.
Patch her through.
Capt. Sheridan.
Senator, what can I do for you?
Taro Isogi, chief executive of FutureCorp has arranged a meeting on Babylon 5 with Amanda Carter a representative of the Mars Provisional Government.
Carter is an outspoken advocate of Mars independence and we suspect FutureCorp is conspiring with her to finance another rebellion on Mars Colony.
Do you have any proof?
We know FutureCorp desperately wants a foothold in space.
An exclusive trade and services agreement with Mars would give it to them if they could move the current Mars Conglomerate out.
Many of the members wanted to pull out after the last rebellion.
Another would have them running like river rats.
I understand your concern, but there's not much I can do about it.
I have no authority over corporate negotiations.
Babylon 5 is neutral territory.
Any race can negotiate here without interference, even our own.
This is a possible threat to Earth Alliance security, captain and as such, we are asking you to check it out.
Nothing official.
Just keep an eye peeled and an ear open and report anything of interest to me.
With all due respect, senator my duties as commander of B5 don't include spying on civilians.
These are volatile times, captain.
Practicality is more important than principles if lives are to be saved.
I'll expect to hear from you soon.
-Yes?
-"Captain..."
...the Tikar delegation is docking.
I'll meet them in the conference room immediately.
Mars has resources the alien worlds need.
Now, they in turn can supply an economic base which will enable the colony to become self-sufficient within 10 years.
You can win your independence without bloodshed.
It will be a hard sell with the Committee.
They'll need concrete assurances from the alien worlds.
Not entirely true.
You're sure the Committee will accept your recommendation.
You're the one who needs assurance.
Yes, I do, Ms. Winters.
Mars is being ripped apart at the seams right now and before I bargain with its future, I need to know what's expected of us.
Naturally.
That's one of the reasons why I suggested Babylon 5 for this meeting.
All our prospective partners have representatives here.
We can iron out all the details to your government's satisfaction.
You actually believe you can make this work?
No, I believe we can try.
I'll speak with the Business Affairs Committee.
I think I can have an answer by tomorrow afternoon.
Very good.
She likes the idea.
She has her doubts, but basically she likes it.
And you?
Now that you've heard the details of my little plan do you also have your doubts?
Frankly, yes.
The financial risk is bad enough but the legal maneuvering will be even--
I want to hear them.
Over dinner?
I'd love to.
Well, commander, may I?
Please.
How did the conference go?
Very well, very well.
Your seating arrangement was flawless.
Latir Corvo himself complimented it.
I think we'll be seeing the Tikar on Babylon 5 soon.
I'm pleased.
They're an interesting people.
And I believe you made first contact with them.
Yes.
The "Agamemnon" was in an unexplored sector beyond the St. Andre Nebula when we sighted this green cloud floating in space.
Only, it wasn't a cloud at all.
It was a ship.
We hailed it, but got no response.
We moved toward it.
It moved away.
We kept that up for hours, until finally they responded.
It took our linguistics division a whole day to get even close to deciphering their language.
They'd already deciphered ours but neglected to tell us so.
Oh, a Jovian sunspot.
-You're indulging.
-I earned it.
And I'm off duty.
Please, continue.
Well, we finally broke the language barrier and introduced ourselves.
And I was invited aboard their ship.
It was incredible.
I'd never seen so much space on a starship.
And the Tikar themselves so unlike any other alien species we'd encountered.
I spent two days with them.
And what I learned in that time made me realize just how wondrous this galaxy of ours really is.
I've never seen you so excited about a deal before.
Well, it's not just a deal, Talia.
It's a step into the future.
Mars can be the beginning of a whole new life for the human species as it was meant to be.
Free Mars.
No!
Taro!
Taro.
So you have no idea what the images you got from the killer meant?
No, it was all too quick.
Just a blur of light and sound and then the blackness.
And all he said was, "Free Mars"?
Yes, but my first assignment was Mars Colony.
I scanned several Free Mars people during that time.
They're violent fanatics with a murderous hatred of Earth Alliance.
But this man was different.
There was no thought of a cause in his head, no anger no emotion of any kind, just those images.
So, what reason would Free Mars have for killing your client?
None.
Taro's proposal was a peaceful solution to the Mars problem.
Earth Central feels differently.
They believe he was going to back another rebellion on Mars.
Taro hated the violence on Mars.
He never would have done such a thing.
Someone's been lying to you, captain.
-Or to you.
-I'm a telepath.
Telepaths are human beings.
You are an old friend of Isogi's.
-You trusted him.
-With good reason.
Taro Isogi spent his life improving the lives of others.
He built a business based on that principle and he never broke a rule or harmed another to do it.
Mars was his dream, captain.
Now he's been murdered for it, and you're trying to cast the blame on him.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
I'm also tired, and I hurt.
May I go back to my quarters now?
Yes.
I'll arrange for an escort.
One escort, at your service.
This really isn't necessary.
Captain's orders.
He's worried about you, and so am I.
This gives us a chance to get to know each other better.
I've led a fascinating life.
Mr. Garibaldi, Taro Isogi was like a father to me.
I loved him as a client and as a mentor and as a friend.
And now he's dead.
You'll forgive me if I'm not in the mood for your usual badinage.
You're right.
This is a bad time for you.
I'm being a yutz.
Apology accepted.
Could you at least tell me what badinage means?
Well, my pop always said that laughter was better than pills for what ails you.
He was right.
We'll get the creep who did this.
I promise.
That won't bring Taro back, or his dreams for Mars Colony.
No.
But it will save someone else from getting killed.

Location of Talia Winters.
I want you to hold all outgoing traffic until further notice.
There's been a murder, and I don't want the killer leaving.
-Do you know who it is?
-Not yet.
But we do have an eyewitness, Talia Winters.
Was she hurt?
Fortunately not.
I think the killer wanted a witness.
Tell me.
What do you think of her?
Ms. Winters?
I think she's an interesting person.
You never describe anybody that way.
I don't really know her that well.
We've chatted from time to time.
And she's interesting.
You know how I feel about telepaths.
Do I ever!
You threw one out of a third-story window on lo.
-There was a pool below the window.
-I'll assume you knew that.
Aside from Ms. Winters' "interesting" quality do you think she can be trusted?
Yes, except she's very loyal to Psi Corps.
And you don't trust Psi Corps?
No.
Do you?
Telepaths are gifted and cursed in ways I can never hope to understand.
But they're still human beings, good, bad or indifferent.
No.
I trust in individuals, not organizations.
Then you may trust Ms. Winters.
Come in.
Ms. Carter, I'm Capt. John Sheridan, commander of Babylon 5.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about your meeting with Taro Isogi.
I'm afraid I must decline, captain.
Private negotiations are not subject to Earthforce scrutiny.
In this case, they are.
Mr. Isogi was murdered last night.
What?
Who could--?
According to an eyewitness, the killer said, "Free Mars."
Free Mars?
Yes.
No, that can't be.
There's no way they could have known about this meeting.
And even if they did, they had nothing to gain by killing Mr. Isogi.
Taro was working to achieve a peaceful compromise that would ensure the colony's independence without bloodshed.
Somebody obviously didn't like it.
Damn them.
Any idea who "they" might be?
The Senate, Mars Conglomerate.
They'd be the most opposed.
I never thought they'd go this far.
Thank you for your time, Ms. Carter.
I may have more questions for you later.
I'll be glad to help.
Whoever killed Taro Isogi killed Mars' best hope for the future.
What have you come up with?
Forensics said Isogi's body was hit with a massive electrical charge.
Disrupted every cell in his body.
There's scorch marks on his throat that show the outline of fingers but no prints or striations of any kind.
A slaver's glove?
No.
I mean, they pack a jolt but not enough to do this much damage.
No, this is high-tech and definitely not standard Free Mars issue.
My guess is some sort of prosthetic weaponry.
What I can't figure is how he got it on station.
A power source that would generate that big a charge should show up on scanners.
Maybe he had some special help.
You want to explain that?
Not until we have more to go on.
Keep an escort on Ms. Winters and intensify the search.
Include EarthGov and Corp secure areas.
Will do.
Captain?
I'd like to know where you're going with this.
Someplace very dark.
I hope to God I'm wrong.
Hey, Earther!
Free Mars.
No.
Help!
Help me, somebody!
What have they done to me?
The images in his mind were the same as before except this time I saw an Earth Alliance ship.
A big one.
A cruiser, I think.
It was firing at him.
And I know this sounds crazy.
But it hit him, and he died.
Died?
It was as if he were reliving the thought of his death over and over again clinging to it as if it were the only thought he had.
Captain, I've got an ID on our perp.
I checked the DNA in the hair that Ms. Winters pulled out.
It's positive.
Take a look.
-That's him.
-He's Free Mars, all right.
One of their leaders in fact.
Name's Abel Horn.
-Abel Horn?
-Do you know him?
In a way.
My wife Anna and I had some very special friends on Mars.
They worked at Ritchey Station.
They were there when Free Mars blew it.
Abel Horn claimed responsibility for it.
I want him, Mr. Garibaldi.
So do I, but there's a problem.
According to Earthforce Intelligence, Abel Horn is dead.
A cruiser scragged his ship over Phobos during the rebellion.
Oh, my God.
Is that what you saw in his mind?
Yes.
Would someone tell me what the hell we're talking about?
Sir?
Later.
Right now I want her in protective custody and a fugitive alert posted on Horn.
Done.
Ms. Winters.
Amanda.
It's been a long time.
I thought you were dead.
Damn near.
Earthers blew me up over Phobos.
Your old buddy Singer found me, got me out.
A snakehead doc fixed me up.
I've been hiding in the Tigris Sector ever since.
Then I got word you were coming here.
-Why did you kill Taro Isogi?
-Who?
The man I came here to meet.
They say you killed him.
There's a fugitive alert out for you.
They're lying.
I haven't killed anyone.
I came here to see you.
I have to get back to Mars, and you're the only one who can help me.
I can't do that, Abel.
I am finally in a position to help with Mars independence.
If anyone found out I was once a member of Free Mars--
Which just might come out if they were to catch me here.
You came here to blackmail me into smuggling you back to Mars?
That was never your style, Abel.
I've changed.
Abel, what's wrong?
Abel!
Amanda, please.
Have to...help me!
Help me!
Did something to...to me.
Telepath knows.
Talia Winters saw it in my head!
Have to find her!
-Lose, lose, lose, lose, losing control!
-Stop!
Stop!
There's one way in, and I have a detail on it.
It'll take an army to get in.
If you need to go somewhere, call the guard post and they'll assign an escort.
Try to relax, enjoy yourself.
We'll take care of this guy.
Mr. Garibaldi?
I was just going to make a cup of tea to soothe my nerves.
Would you like one?
Well, since I am chief of Security, I guess seeing you're secure is my job.
And tea just happens to be my third favorite thing in the universe.
I needed this yesterday.
The captain of the "Matheson" is demanding an update on his departure.
Tell him to go away.
Tell them all to go away.
-How's it going?
-We've had 20 complaints six formal protests and one threat, all in the last hour.
The natives are restless.
Start moving them out.
What about the murderer?
I don't think he's trying to leave yet.
But have every ship searched.
I'll be in my quarters.
There's something I want to check out.
So then my pop says to the guy, "Fifty credits for a salami?
I could've killed you for 20."
-Your father was quite a character.
-He was the best.
He cooked like an angel, swore like the devil and taught me everything about security.
He could spot a crook a sector away, and he was still hauling them in at 75.
Then he got Torg's Syndrome and just kind of faded away.
I sure miss him.
I never really knew my father or my mother.
I was raised by Psi Corps from the time I was 5.
-Of course, there was Abby.
-Abby?
She was my support during my first year at the Center.
When telepaths first come, a senior telepath guides them through the program.
The first day I was crying all the time.
I was scared and confused and hurting.
And then Abby came.
She held me for a very long time, never saying a word.
I didn't know it then, but she was scanning me, ever so gently.
And little by little, the pain and fear and confusion melted.
And all that was left was this warm, safe place in my mind.
It was wonderful.
But the next year Abby was assigned to another newcomer.
Garibaldi.
Mr. Garibaldi, please report to my quarters.
On my way.
Sorry.
Mr. Garibaldi.
Thank you.
My pleasure, Ms. Winters.
Come.
Mr. Garibaldi, take a look at this.
Project Lazarus?
Never heard of it.
It was part of Earthforce's cyber experiments back in the late '30s.
The cyber experiments were a bust.
Humans couldn't function...
-...with machines in their brains.
-Correct.
That's why they decided to use subjects on the verge of death:
Accident victims, wounded soldiers, people in comas--
You're kidding?
That's grotesque.
It gets even better.
The theory was to hardwire the subject's brain with a computer intelligence.
It kept the brain functional while the body was repaired.
Then using telepathic deep-scan the subject was fixated on the moment of his death shutting down all conscious thought.
The computer takes complete control while the subject is dying over and over again in his subconscious.
Ms. Winters said that Horn was clinging to the thought of his death as if it were the only thought he had.
Hold on.
Are you saying Horn is one of these cyber zombies?
I'm saying he might be.
His body could have been recovered after the blast.
Or Intelligence was wrong again, and Horn was never in the ship that was blasted.
Well, that's the simple explanation.
And ordinarily I'd accept it, but this isn't a simple thing.
A known Free Mars terrorist kills a man in front of a witness and leaves her alive.
Later he kills another man to get to that witness and again leaves her alive.
Why?
He's squeamish about killing women?
Or maybe Talia Winters touched something in him.
Something that made Horn realize who he really was for a moment.
I think it's playing havoc with his programming.
-You almost have me believing this load.
-I'm not sure I believe it myself.
But if it's true, there should be a way to locate him.
Command?
I'd like to make a transmission to Ms. Talia Winters.
Working.
-So you'll meet with me?
-"Yes.
In a half"-"hour?"
I'll look forward to it.
-Amanda, I knew you'd help me.
-Abel, all I did was--
This is a long shot.
My information on Lazarus is 20 years old but according to the files the computer power crystal emits a low level of a benign radiation.
It wouldn't ordinarily show up on the environmental scanners but if we could reconfigure them to look for it....
-Garibaldi.
-"Chief, Zack Allan."
Ms. Winters is requesting an escort for a business meeting in Red 7.
-With who?
-"Amanda Carter."
That's a go, Zack.
Come through Red Alpha.
I'll join you at Point 6.
This is trickier than I thought.
The element is definitely out-of-date.
Why not let the wizard have a go?
Now, all we have to do is cross-reference with the Medlab files find the updated element number log that with e-systems and, voilá!
It's trickier than you thought.
Thanks Mr. Wizard.
Ms. Winters, it's not a good idea to be roaming around the station.
I'm hardly roaming.
No, I guess not.
So, what's up?
Amanda Carter wants to pursue Taro's plan.
I don't know if I can convince FutureCorp to go along but if I could, it would be like a memorial for Taro.
They can kill a good man but not a good idea.
Take your time.
We'll be right here.
Hello?
Hello?
Ms. Carter?
Ms. Carter.
Make one sound, and I'll kill you.
That should do it.
Computer, begin scan.
Commencing.
What am I?
Tell me!
I don't understand.
You're a mindbender.
You saw it in my head.
Tell me what it means!
Tell me!
-Pain.
Pain.
-Yes, pain!
Tell me.
Tell me, please.
Please.
Ours now.
All ours.
You were dying.
They operated on you, rebuilt you.
Scanned you.
There was a Psi Cop.
Scan complete.
"Low"-"level ironium radiation detected."
Red 7, Suite 15.
Suite 15?
Amanda Carter.
Garibaldi.
-"Captain?"
-Where's Ms. Winters?
Meeting with Ms. Carter in her quarters.
Our perp's inside.
Get him, but get him alive.
I'm on my way.
Our perp's inside!
Jackson, left side.
Hansen, right.
Watch out for Talia and remember this guy kills by touch.
Zack, let's get the door.
Ready?
Go.
Freeze!
I'll fry her.
I swear it.
End of the road, pal.
There's nowhere to go.
-Come on, think about it.
-Can't think.
Die when I think.
Okay, okay.
-Take it easy.
-Drop the guns.
Back off.
Do it!
You hurt her and I'll see it takes you 10 days to die.
I'm already dead, Mr. Security Man.
No, you aren't, Horn.
Now, just listen to me.
They are using you to betray your own world.
How do you know this?
You know it too, Abel.
You can feel the machine crawling in your brain.
Get out of my way!
Let us help you.
That's all we want to do.
You let her go, and we'll help you.
You've died too many times, Abel.
There's no need to die again.
Good.
Now, put the weapon down.
It was the Earthers, wasn't it?
It wasn't enough just to kill me?
We'll find out who it was together.
Just put the gun down.
Mars will never be free until the sands run red with Earther blood.
Thanks for ending it, Earther.
Damn it.
Captain, I'm reading a dangerous energy surge from the body.
Get her out of here.
Come on, everybody out.
Everybody out!
Come on!
Go now!
No trace.
No evidence.
I am very sorry, Ms. Winters.
Abel said you knew what was wrong with him.
I was worried about him.
-I didn't think he'd harm you.
-And how does a Mars Government rep know so much about a Free Mars terrorist?
Abel Horn wasn't always a terrorist.
Fifteen years ago he was a bright young man utterly devoted to independence for Mars Colony.
That's when I met him.
Fell in love with him.
He convinced me to join Free Mars.
It wasn't a radical group at the time.
Later, when they began to become violent, I left them.
I never saw Abel again until today.
Tell me another one.
You can have Ms. Winters scan me if you think I'm lying.
Besides, I've already said enough to ruin my career.
If we report it.
Are you proposing a deal, captain?
You said Taro Isogi's plan was the best hope for Mars.
-Did you mean that?
-Yes.
Then continue to negotiate with FutureCorp.
Make that happen.
I doubt they'd be interested after what happened here.
I'll be glad to speak to them for you.
I'll make it clear that your government had nothing to do with the murder.
I'm sure they'll consider going ahead.
Why?
To make sure Taro Isogi's dream becomes a reality and to keep you where you can do the most good.
Thank you.
We'll talk later.
Captain, begging your pardon, but have you gone space happy?
She is an accessory to murder and attempted murder.
Horn wasn't trying to kill me.
He wanted me to scan him.
There was something in his mind, controlling him...
-...something he wanted me to find.
-And did you?
I saw an image, some sort of an operation.
Well, did you recognize anything?
A location, a face, uniform?
No.
Take Ms. Winters to her quarters.
I'll help lvanova move the traffic out.
Captain.
Mr. Garibaldi.
Is there something?
There's a whole list.
But let's start with how you knew about the Lazarus Project.
Some people collect coins or art.
I collect secrets.
Black projects, conspiracies, secret organizations.
They fascinate me.
Does one of those secrets include who was behind this thing?
-It's better you don't ask that.
-Look, captain you don't trust me the way Jeff used to, but if there's a threat--
The threat goes far beyond Babylon 5, Mr. Garibaldi.
I'm not surprised.
If Horn was what you say he was, then this has nothing to do with Free Mars.
To pull something like this off would take a lot of power and a lot of money.
And I think you know who it is.
All right.
But promise me this information will never be repeated outside this room.
You got it.
For the past six years there have been rumors about a rogue agency operating deep inside EarthGov.
A dirty-trick squad dealing in black projects and star chamber justice.
It took me over three years just to get a name.
Bureau 13.
And the man who gave me that name died soon after.
I am convinced they exist and that they are behind this incident.
Why?
Isogi was a danger to Earth policy on Mars.
I think his death was a warning to the other corporations.
I also think Horn was meant to destroy Free Mars from the inside and possibly ruin Amanda Carter as well.
Unfortunately...
-...
I can't prove any of it.
-If this is true--
Then everything we believe in is in jeopardy.
There is a spider in the web, Mr. Garibaldi.
And I intend to find it and kill it.
Thirteen.
Report from Babylon 5 Control.
Mission only partly successful.
Isogi terminated but unit was destroyed before he could leave station for Mars.
Is the Bureau at hazard?
Control does not believe so.
Belief is not enough.
He is to follow up until he is certain.
Thirteen out.

All ours.

Six yarwood chairs placed precisely one meter apart in a star pattern with the hee-lok on the center chair.
Very good.
-Sheridan.
-"Captain..."
...there's a problem in the ambassadorial section.
We need a command officer.
I'll handle it.
Help is on the way.
It's good to be the captain.
Isogi-san.
Talia, it's been too long.
What did you think of my NeoMars proposal?
It's like all your proposals: too progressive, too risky and too costly in the short run.
-But if you can make it happen....
-I must make it happen.
FutureCorp has to expand beyond Earth, and Mars is the first step.
The Senate won't like it, and the Mars Conglomerate will try to bury you.
We're prepared for that.
Now I need only convince Mars to share the risk.
And if they won't?
Then their path to freedom may well be drenched with innocent blood and a long-held dream of mine will die.
Mr. Isogi?
Amanda Carter, Mars Colony Business Affairs Committee.
Ms. Carter, Ms. Talia Winters one of the finest commercial telepaths I've ever worked with.
She will be monitoring our negotiations for FutureCorp.
Ms. Winters.
Please.
I read your proposal, Mr. Isogi.
Frankly, you're either insane or a very brave man.
That's what they said of your great-grandfather, John when he volunteered to pilot the first colony ship to Mars.
So they did.
Let's talk.
Please.
--"begin by focusing more on the needs" of our own people to move on to create the world that Luis Santiago....
Thirteen.
All components have arrived safely on Babylon 5.
Control is prepared to go online.
Commence operation.
The Babylon Project was our last, best hope for peace.
"A self"-"contained world, five miles long," located in neutral territory.
A place of commerce and diplomacy for a quarter of a million humans and aliens.
A shining beacon in space, all alone in the night.
It was the dawn of the Third Age of mankind.
The year the Great War came upon us all.
This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations.
The year is 2259.
The name of the place is Babylon 5.
Sheridan.
Captain, you have a transmission from Senator Voudreau.
Patch her through.
Capt. Sheridan.
Senator, what can I do for you?
Taro Isogi, chief executive of FutureCorp has arranged a meeting on Babylon 5 with Amanda Carter a representative of the Mars Provisional Government.
Carter is an outspoken advocate of Mars independence and we suspect FutureCorp is conspiring with her to finance another rebellion on Mars Colony.
Do you have any proof?
We know FutureCorp desperately wants a foothold in space.
An exclusive trade and services agreement with Mars would give it to them if they could move the current Mars Conglomerate out.
Many of the members wanted to pull out after the last rebellion.
Another would have them running like river rats.
I understand your concern, but there's not much I can do about it.
I have no authority over corporate negotiations.
Babylon 5 is neutral territory.
Any race can negotiate here without interference, even our own.
This is a possible threat to Earth Alliance security, captain and as such, we are asking you to check it out.
Nothing official.
Just keep an eye peeled and an ear open and report anything of interest to me.
With all due respect, senator my duties as commander of B5 don't include spying on civilians.
These are volatile times, captain.
Practicality is more important than principles if lives are to be saved.
I'll expect to hear from you soon.
-Yes?
-"Captain..."
...the Tikar delegation is docking.
I'll meet them in the conference room immediately.
Mars has resources the alien worlds need.
Now, they in turn can supply an economic base which will enable the colony to become self-sufficient within 10 years.
You can win your independence without bloodshed.
It will be a hard sell with the Committee.
They'll need concrete assurances from the alien worlds.
Not entirely true.
You're sure the Committee will accept your recommendation.
You're the one who needs assurance.
Yes, I do, Ms. Winters.
Mars is being ripped apart at the seams right now and before I bargain with its future, I need to know what's expected of us.
Naturally.
That's one of the reasons why I suggested Babylon 5 for this meeting.
All our prospective partners have representatives here.
We can iron out all the details to your government's satisfaction.
You actually believe you can make this work?
No, I believe we can try.
I'll speak with the Business Affairs Committee.
I think I can have an answer by tomorrow afternoon.
Very good.
She likes the idea.
She has her doubts, but basically she likes it.
And you?
Now that you've heard the details of my little plan do you also have your doubts?
Frankly, yes.
The financial risk is bad enough but the legal maneuvering will be even--
I want to hear them.
Over dinner?
I'd love to.
Well, commander, may I?
Please.
How did the conference go?
Very well, very well.
Your seating arrangement was flawless.
Latir Corvo himself complimented it.
I think we'll be seeing the Tikar on Babylon 5 soon.
I'm pleased.
They're an interesting people.
And I believe you made first contact with them.
Yes.
The "Agamemnon" was in an unexplored sector beyond the St. Andre Nebula when we sighted this green cloud floating in space.
Only, it wasn't a cloud at all.
It was a ship.
We hailed it, but got no response.
We moved toward it.
It moved away.
We kept that up for hours, until finally they responded.
It took our linguistics division a whole day to get even close to deciphering their language.
They'd already deciphered ours but neglected to tell us so.
Oh, a Jovian sunspot.
-You're indulging.
-I earned it.
And I'm off duty.
Please, continue.
Well, we finally broke the language barrier and introduced ourselves.
And I was invited aboard their ship.
It was incredible.
I'd never seen so much space on a starship.
And the Tikar themselves so unlike any other alien species we'd encountered.
I spent two days with them.
And what I learned in that time made me realize just how wondrous this galaxy of ours really is.
I've never seen you so excited about a deal before.
Well, it's not just a deal, Talia.
It's a step into the future.
Mars can be the beginning of a whole new life for the human species as it was meant to be.
Free Mars.
No!
Taro!
Taro.
So you have no idea what the images you got from the killer meant?
No, it was all too quick.
Just a blur of light and sound and then the blackness.
And all he said was, "Free Mars"?
Yes, but my first assignment was Mars Colony.
I scanned several Free Mars people during that time.
They're violent fanatics with a murderous hatred of Earth Alliance.
But this man was different.
There was no thought of a cause in his head, no anger no emotion of any kind, just those images.
So, what reason would Free Mars have for killing your client?
None.
Taro's proposal was a peaceful solution to the Mars problem.
Earth Central feels differently.
They believe he was going to back another rebellion on Mars.
Taro hated the violence on Mars.
He never would have done such a thing.
Someone's been lying to you, captain.
-Or to you.
-I'm a telepath.
Telepaths are human beings.
You are an old friend of Isogi's.
-You trusted him.
-With good reason.
Taro Isogi spent his life improving the lives of others.
He built a business based on that principle and he never broke a rule or harmed another to do it.
Mars was his dream, captain.
Now he's been murdered for it, and you're trying to cast the blame on him.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
I'm also tired, and I hurt.
May I go back to my quarters now?
Yes.
I'll arrange for an escort.
One escort, at your service.
This really isn't necessary.
Captain's orders.
He's worried about you, and so am I.
This gives us a chance to get to know each other better.
I've led a fascinating life.
Mr. Garibaldi, Taro Isogi was like a father to me.
I loved him as a client and as a mentor and as a friend.
And now he's dead.
You'll forgive me if I'm not in the mood for your usual badinage.
You're right.
This is a bad time for you.
I'm being a yutz.
Apology accepted.
Could you at least tell me what badinage means?
Well, my pop always said that laughter was better than pills for what ails you.
He was right.
We'll get the creep who did this.
I promise.
That won't bring Taro back, or his dreams for Mars Colony.
No.
But it will save someone else from getting killed.

Location of Talia Winters.
I want you to hold all outgoing traffic until further notice.
There's been a murder, and I don't want the killer leaving.
-Do you know who it is?
-Not yet.
But we do have an eyewitness, Talia Winters.
Was she hurt?
Fortunately not.
I think the killer wanted a witness.
Tell me.
What do you think of her?
Ms. Winters?
I think she's an interesting person.
You never describe anybody that way.
I don't really know her that well.
We've chatted from time to time.
And she's interesting.
You know how I feel about telepaths.
Do I ever!
You threw one out of a third-story window on lo.
-There was a pool below the window.
-I'll assume you knew that.
Aside from Ms. Winters' "interesting" quality do you think she can be trusted?
Yes, except she's very loyal to Psi Corps.
And you don't trust Psi Corps?
No.
Do you?
Telepaths are gifted and cursed in ways I can never hope to understand.
But they're still human beings, good, bad or indifferent.
No.
I trust in individuals, not organizations.
Then you may trust Ms. Winters.
Come in.
Ms. Carter, I'm Capt. John Sheridan, commander of Babylon 5.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about your meeting with Taro Isogi.
I'm afraid I must decline, captain.
Private negotiations are not subject to Earthforce scrutiny.
In this case, they are.
Mr. Isogi was murdered last night.
What?
Who could--?
According to an eyewitness, the killer said, "Free Mars."
Free Mars?
Yes.
No, that can't be.
There's no way they could have known about this meeting.
And even if they did, they had nothing to gain by killing Mr. Isogi.
Taro was working to achieve a peaceful compromise that would ensure the colony's independence without bloodshed.
Somebody obviously didn't like it.
Damn them.
Any idea who "they" might be?
The Senate, Mars Conglomerate.
They'd be the most opposed.
I never thought they'd go this far.
Thank you for your time, Ms. Carter.
I may have more questions for you later.
I'll be glad to help.
Whoever killed Taro Isogi killed Mars' best hope for the future.
What have you come up with?
Forensics said Isogi's body was hit with a massive electrical charge.
Disrupted every cell in his body.
There's scorch marks on his throat that show the outline of fingers but no prints or striations of any kind.
A slaver's glove?
No.
I mean, they pack a jolt but not enough to do this much damage.
No, this is high-tech and definitely not standard Free Mars issue.
My guess is some sort of prosthetic weaponry.
What I can't figure is how he got it on station.
A power source that would generate that big a charge should show up on scanners.
Maybe he had some special help.
You want to explain that?
Not until we have more to go on.
Keep an escort on Ms. Winters and intensify the search.
Include EarthGov and Corp secure areas.
Will do.
Captain?
I'd like to know where you're going with this.
Someplace very dark.
I hope to God I'm wrong.
Hey, Earther!
Free Mars.
No.
Help!
Help me, somebody!
What have they done to me?
The images in his mind were the same as before except this time I saw an Earth Alliance ship.
A big one.
A cruiser, I think.
It was firing at him.
And I know this sounds crazy.
But it hit him, and he died.
Died?
It was as if he were reliving the thought of his death over and over again clinging to it as if it were the only thought he had.
Captain, I've got an ID on our perp.
I checked the DNA in the hair that Ms. Winters pulled out.
It's positive.
Take a look.
-That's him.
-He's Free Mars, all right.
One of their leaders in fact.
Name's Abel Horn.
-Abel Horn?
-Do you know him?
In a way.
My wife Anna and I had some very special friends on Mars.
They worked at Ritchey Station.
They were there when Free Mars blew it.
Abel Horn claimed responsibility for it.
I want him, Mr. Garibaldi.
So do I, but there's a problem.
According to Earthforce Intelligence, Abel Horn is dead.
A cruiser scragged his ship over Phobos during the rebellion.
Oh, my God.
Is that what you saw in his mind?
Yes.
Would someone tell me what the hell we're talking about?
Sir?
Later.
Right now I want her in protective custody and a fugitive alert posted on Horn.
Done.
Ms. Winters.
Amanda.
It's been a long time.
I thought you were dead.
Damn near.
Earthers blew me up over Phobos.
Your old buddy Singer found me, got me out.
A snakehead doc fixed me up.
I've been hiding in the Tigris Sector ever since.
Then I got word you were coming here.
-Why did you kill Taro Isogi?
-Who?
The man I came here to meet.
They say you killed him.
There's a fugitive alert out for you.
They're lying.
I haven't killed anyone.
I came here to see you.
I have to get back to Mars, and you're the only one who can help me.
I can't do that, Abel.
I am finally in a position to help with Mars independence.
If anyone found out I was once a member of Free Mars--
Which just might come out if they were to catch me here.
You came here to blackmail me into smuggling you back to Mars?
That was never your style, Abel.
I've changed.
Abel, what's wrong?
Abel!
Amanda, please.
Have to...help me!
Help me!
Did something to...to me.
Telepath knows.
Talia Winters saw it in my head!
Have to find her!
-Lose, lose, lose, lose, losing control!
-Stop!
Stop!
There's one way in, and I have a detail on it.
It'll take an army to get in.
If you need to go somewhere, call the guard post and they'll assign an escort.
Try to relax, enjoy yourself.
We'll take care of this guy.
Mr. Garibaldi?
I was just going to make a cup of tea to soothe my nerves.
Would you like one?
Well, since I am chief of Security, I guess seeing you're secure is my job.
And tea just happens to be my third favorite thing in the universe.
I needed this yesterday.
The captain of the "Matheson" is demanding an update on his departure.
Tell him to go away.
Tell them all to go away.
-How's it going?
-We've had 20 complaints six formal protests and one threat, all in the last hour.
The natives are restless.
Start moving them out.
What about the murderer?
I don't think he's trying to leave yet.
But have every ship searched.
I'll be in my quarters.
There's something I want to check out.
So then my pop says to the guy, "Fifty credits for a salami?
I could've killed you for 20."
-Your father was quite a character.
-He was the best.
He cooked like an angel, swore like the devil and taught me everything about security.
He could spot a crook a sector away, and he was still hauling them in at 75.
Then he got Torg's Syndrome and just kind of faded away.
I sure miss him.
I never really knew my father or my mother.
I was raised by Psi Corps from the time I was 5.
-Of course, there was Abby.
-Abby?
She was my support during my first year at the Center.
When telepaths first come, a senior telepath guides them through the program.
The first day I was crying all the time.
I was scared and confused and hurting.
And then Abby came.
She held me for a very long time, never saying a word.
I didn't know it then, but she was scanning me, ever so gently.
And little by little, the pain and fear and confusion melted.
And all that was left was this warm, safe place in my mind.
It was wonderful.
But the next year Abby was assigned to another newcomer.
Garibaldi.
Mr. Garibaldi, please report to my quarters.
On my way.
Sorry.
Mr. Garibaldi.
Thank you.
My pleasure, Ms. Winters.
Come.
Mr. Garibaldi, take a look at this.
Project Lazarus?
Never heard of it.
It was part of Earthforce's cyber experiments back in the late '30s.
The cyber experiments were a bust.
Humans couldn't function...
-...with machines in their brains.
-Correct.
That's why they decided to use subjects on the verge of death:
Accident victims, wounded soldiers, people in comas--
You're kidding?
That's grotesque.
It gets even better.
The theory was to hardwire the subject's brain with a computer intelligence.
It kept the brain functional while the body was repaired.
Then using telepathic deep-scan the subject was fixated on the moment of his death shutting down all conscious thought.
The computer takes complete control while the subject is dying over and over again in his subconscious.
Ms. Winters said that Horn was clinging to the thought of his death as if it were the only thought he had.
Hold on.
Are you saying Horn is one of these cyber zombies?
I'm saying he might be.
His body could have been recovered after the blast.
Or Intelligence was wrong again, and Horn was never in the ship that was blasted.
Well, that's the simple explanation.
And ordinarily I'd accept it, but this isn't a simple thing.
A known Free Mars terrorist kills a man in front of a witness and leaves her alive.
Later he kills another man to get to that witness and again leaves her alive.
Why?
He's squeamish about killing women?
Or maybe Talia Winters touched something in him.
Something that made Horn realize who he really was for a moment.
I think it's playing havoc with his programming.
-You almost have me believing this load.
-I'm not sure I believe it myself.
But if it's true, there should be a way to locate him.
Command?
I'd like to make a transmission to Ms. Talia Winters.
Working.
-So you'll meet with me?
-"Yes.
In a half"-"hour?"
I'll look forward to it.
-Amanda, I knew you'd help me.
-Abel, all I did was--
This is a long shot.
My information on Lazarus is 20 years old but according to the files the computer power crystal emits a low level of a benign radiation.
It wouldn't ordinarily show up on the environmental scanners but if we could reconfigure them to look for it....
-Garibaldi.
-"Chief, Zack Allan."
Ms. Winters is requesting an escort for a business meeting in Red 7.
-With who?
-"Amanda Carter."
That's a go, Zack.
Come through Red Alpha.
I'll join you at Point 6.
This is trickier than I thought.
The element is definitely out-of-date.
Why not let the wizard have a go?
Now, all we have to do is cross-reference with the Medlab files find the updated element number log that with e-systems and, voilá!
It's trickier than you thought.
Thanks Mr. Wizard.
Ms. Winters, it's not a good idea to be roaming around the station.
I'm hardly roaming.
No, I guess not.
So, what's up?
Amanda Carter wants to pursue Taro's plan.
I don't know if I can convince FutureCorp to go along but if I could, it would be like a memorial for Taro.
They can kill a good man but not a good idea.
Take your time.
We'll be right here.
Hello?
Hello?
Ms. Carter?
Ms. Carter.
Make one sound, and I'll kill you.
That should do it.
Computer, begin scan.
Commencing.
What am I?
Tell me!
I don't understand.
You're a mindbender.
You saw it in my head.
Tell me what it means!
Tell me!
-Pain.
Pain.
-Yes, pain!
Tell me.
Tell me, please.
Please.
Ours now.
All ours.
You were dying.
They operated on you, rebuilt you.
Scanned you.
There was a Psi Cop.
Scan complete.
"Low"-"level ironium radiation detected."
Red 7, Suite 15.
Suite 15?
Amanda Carter.
Garibaldi.
-"Captain?"
-Where's Ms. Winters?
Meeting with Ms. Carter in her quarters.
Our perp's inside.
Get him, but get him alive.
I'm on my way.
Our perp's inside!
Jackson, left side.
Hansen, right.
Watch out for Talia and remember this guy kills by touch.
Zack, let's get the door.
Ready?
Go.
Freeze!
I'll fry her.
I swear it.
End of the road, pal.
There's nowhere to go.
-Come on, think about it.
-Can't think.
Die when I think.
Okay, okay.
-Take it easy.
-Drop the guns.
Back off.
Do it!
You hurt her and I'll see it takes you 10 days to die.
I'm already dead, Mr. Security Man.
No, you aren't, Horn.
Now, just listen to me.
They are using you to betray your own world.
How do you know this?
You know it too, Abel.
You can feel the machine crawling in your brain.
Get out of my way!
Let us help you.
That's all we want to do.
You let her go, and we'll help you.
You've died too many times, Abel.
There's no need to die again.
Good.
Now, put the weapon down.
It was the Earthers, wasn't it?
It wasn't enough just to kill me?
We'll find out who it was together.
Just put the gun down.
Mars will never be free until the sands run red with Earther blood.
Thanks for ending it, Earther.
Damn it.
Captain, I'm reading a dangerous energy surge from the body.
Get her out of here.
Come on, everybody out.
Everybody out!
Come on!
Go now!
No trace.
No evidence.
I am very sorry, Ms. Winters.
Abel said you knew what was wrong with him.
I was worried about him.
-I didn't think he'd harm you.
-And how does a Mars Government rep know so much about a Free Mars terrorist?
Abel Horn wasn't always a terrorist.
Fifteen years ago he was a bright young man utterly devoted to independence for Mars Colony.
That's when I met him.
Fell in love with him.
He convinced me to join Free Mars.
It wasn't a radical group at the time.
Later, when they began to become violent, I left them.
I never saw Abel again until today.
Tell me another one.
You can have Ms. Winters scan me if you think I'm lying.
Besides, I've already said enough to ruin my career.
If we report it.
Are you proposing a deal, captain?
You said Taro Isogi's plan was the best hope for Mars.
-Did you mean that?
-Yes.
Then continue to negotiate with FutureCorp.
Make that happen.
I doubt they'd be interested after what happened here.
I'll be glad to speak to them for you.
I'll make it clear that your government had nothing to do with the murder.
I'm sure they'll consider going ahead.
Why?
To make sure Taro Isogi's dream becomes a reality and to keep you where you can do the most good.
Thank you.
We'll talk later.
Captain, begging your pardon, but have you gone space happy?
She is an accessory to murder and attempted murder.
Horn wasn't trying to kill me.
He wanted me to scan him.
There was something in his mind, controlling him...
-...something he wanted me to find.
-And did you?
I saw an image, some sort of an operation.
Well, did you recognize anything?
A location, a face, uniform?
No.
Take Ms. Winters to her quarters.
I'll help lvanova move the traffic out.
Captain.
Mr. Garibaldi.
Is there something?
There's a whole list.
But let's start with how you knew about the Lazarus Project.
Some people collect coins or art.
I collect secrets.
Black projects, conspiracies, secret organizations.
They fascinate me.
Does one of those secrets include who was behind this thing?
-It's better you don't ask that.
-Look, captain you don't trust me the way Jeff used to, but if there's a threat--
The threat goes far beyond Babylon 5, Mr. Garibaldi.
I'm not surprised.
If Horn was what you say he was, then this has nothing to do with Free Mars.
To pull something like this off would take a lot of power and a lot of money.
And I think you know who it is.
All right.
But promise me this information will never be repeated outside this room.
You got it.
For the past six years there have been rumors about a rogue agency operating deep inside EarthGov.
A dirty-trick squad dealing in black projects and star chamber justice.
It took me over three years just to get a name.
Bureau 13.
And the man who gave me that name died soon after.
I am convinced they exist and that they are behind this incident.
Why?
Isogi was a danger to Earth policy on Mars.
I think his death was a warning to the other corporations.
I also think Horn was meant to destroy Free Mars from the inside and possibly ruin Amanda Carter as well.
Unfortunately...
-...
I can't prove any of it.
-If this is true--
Then everything we believe in is in jeopardy.
There is a spider in the web, Mr. Garibaldi.
And I intend to find it and kill it.
Thirteen.
Report from Babylon 5 Control.
Mission only partly successful.
Isogi terminated but unit was destroyed before he could leave station for Mars.
Is the Bureau at hazard?
Control does not believe so.
Belief is not enough.
He is to follow up until he is certain.
Thirteen out.
Scanning files from listed data.
All ours.
Match found.

Brlan, honey?
Are you Ignoring me, sweetheart?
If you are, It's okay.
Just tell me.
My mother Is a behavioral psychologist.
If you left him alone, maybe he'd break out of this prolonged latency.
And my father Is a Freudlan psychiatrist.
- Our child is not in latency.
- Keep living in denial, Bernice.
Which basically means that they fundamentally disagree... on everything.
- Brl?
Everything all right?
- Feel free not to respond.
At Angela's house, they probably laugh and eat unbalanced meals... and talk about things that don't have deep symbolic meaning.
They're probably this like normal family.
- Child abuse!
- Well, it's tangled.
Where the hell is it?
Sweetie, I can't do braids in a basement.
- It was right here.
- Fine, I'll do my braids myself.
So this is actually happening?
You're actually going to wallpaper the bedroom?
- Yes, what's the big deal?
- Nothing.
Except this wallpaper sat here through the entire Bush administration.
I just figure since I'm not working, you know, keep me off the streets.
So you feel okay about...
I mean, you've done this before, right?
- Patty, I can wallpaper a room.
- Right, I'm sorry.
This is really great.
I became yearbook photographer because I liked the idea... that I could sort of watch life without having to be a part of It.
But when you are yearbook photographer... you are never In the picture.
I'm yearbook photographer.
This is my job.
Brian, I'd like you to meet Delia.
She's new.
- It's really nice meeting you.
- Yes.
Maybe I'll see you around?
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Nice, Krakow.
Real suave.
- What?
It was pretty obvious what she was thinking.
What?
She likes you.
Ask her to the dance!
Hold on, wait.
This World Happiness thing?
It's not a "thing".
It's a dance.
Which I am trying to make into a great dance.
Which is almost impossible since apparently the idea of school spirit... is out the window.
Wait, so getting back to this Delia thing...
She's working at Big Guy Burger tonight from 3:30 until 8:00.
Did she actually say anything?
Let's just say it was very clearly implied.
I mean, World Happiness!
Who thought of that?
- It sounds like Sharon.
- Definitely Sharon.
- So, are you like going?
- What?
I know, I just thought in this really obvious way it'd be sort of fun.
Angela, if you expect Jordan Catalano to ask you...
- Maybe she just wants to dance.
- Exactly.
Wait, so there's no chance?
Angela, Jordan Catalano doesn't go to school dances.
- As, like, policy.
- Right.
I sort of figured.
So...
I mean, if you wanted to go, which of course you don't... you could let Brian Krakow ask you.
- Rayanne!
- What?
If you don't get Catalano, you've got Brian Krakow to pay.
Then excuse me, I'd be at the dance with Brian Krakow.
- Excuse me?
- Can we help you?
I was just...
Is Miss Chavatal around?
Do you see Miss Chavatal?
Cool vest.
What has always amazed me, Is fishermen.
How they wait there forever... and when something finally tugs on their line, they don't panic.
The strange thing is... even though I've established verbal communication with Della Flsher...
I still think about Angela, constantly.
Why am I like this?
I truly slcken myself.
I just have to stop being her little puppet.
I vow to never again... to show up at Angela's door with some lame excuse.
Hi.
I mean, hello.
I sort of lent this atlas to Angela... which she was technically supposed to return in March.
So...
Well, she isn't here now.
- Could you...
- Right.
Right.
So, putting up wallpaper?
Lower, lower.
Wait.
The morning glories aren't lined up.
In my room, one seam is a little off and I stare at it constantly.
It's like destroying me.
So, you're like what, retired?
I mean, I mean, not retired.
No.
I'm sort of planning what to do next.
I don't want to jump into anything blindly.
I mean, it's like wallpaper.
I mean, there are hundreds of patterns out there, and it's kind of daunting... because you're going to have to live with your decision for a long time.
Let's say you're deciding between two particular patterns... and one of them, you definitely know that you really like... and the other is nice wallpaper and all, but just you're not sure if it's really...
- For you.
- Exactly.
But the really great wallpaper... let's say, is totally out of your price range.
Do you take the other wallpaper, even though you don't, let's say... really desire it that much, or do you wait until... the really great wallpaper is cheaper.
I guess it depends on how badly you need wallpaper.
- I would say pretty badly.
- I guess that says it.
Yes.
I can't believe this.
Apparently Della Flsher smiles at everyone.
She's probably from one of those small towns... friendly and smiles at you for no reason.
I hate that type of town.
Napkins.
Thanks for choosing Big Guy.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Welcome to Big Guy Burger, where every guy is a big guy.
I was just, you know, happened to be in the neighborhood, and so...
So, what can I get for you?
- Just a Hunkburger.
- For here or to go?
I guess to go.
I just, you know, should probably go.
There's something about my life.
It's just automatically true that nothing actually happens.
Not hungry after all?
I was told not to eat red meat by my doctor.
So...
Sorry about being so standard in there.
My manager watches us.
- Right.
- I'm glad you came.
Somewhere far away there was a car alarm.
One of those really annoying ones.
Do you want a sip?
But suddenly, It was the best sound I had ever heard.
So, I guess I should go.
Me, too.
So maybe this is what people mean... when they talk about, you know, life.
So are you going to ask me to this dance, or what?
I was going to, eventually.
So you just haven't gotten around to it?
Exactly.
Look, Kyle.
I am under a ton of pressure here, okay?
The dance committee, student council, yearbook, band.
I don't have time to worry about being alone at the very dance I organized!
Fine.
Would you like to go to the dance with me?
Yes.
And if you screw this up, I will really hate you.
Like forever.
My life is so ridiculous.
I have to ask Della Flsher to the dance.
I have to.
And I'll do It now.
On the count of three.
One.
Two.
Three.
- I got to run.
I'll catch you later.
- Okay.
Speak!
- Hey.
What's going on?
- Not much.
- So.
You going to the dance?
- Doubtful.
You?
I would kind of have to say, at this point, no.
Guidance is so weird.
So she looked at me all concerned... wanting to know if I was going to the school dance... like that wasn't the stupidest question in history.
And so, I broke down and cried.
It was hysterical.
But, I mean, how's it going?
I mean, how're you doing?
Ten days.
No drink, no drugs.
I'm so clean you could eat off me.
- So, you know that girl, Pam Troy?
- The one with the really bad perm?
No, the one with the diamond stud in her nose.
The one with the crop-tops and... she broke down and cried that time in Human Sexuality?
Yes, so?
So I was thinking of asking her to the dance.
Why?
I know you think the dance is really stupid...
- Why don't you ask him?
- Shut up!
Well, isn't that who you really want to go with?
Isn't it?
Yes, in some imaginary universe that exists in my mind, but...
Leave it to me.
Rayanne, if you say one word to him, I'd kill you.
Rayanne!
My.
Are those morning glories not lining up?
They're lining up.
Because if they're even the slightest bit off... that's all you're ever going to notice.
Is that a bubble?
Patty, I tried every conceivable way to get rid of that bubble.
It is there forever, it's part of our lives.
It will outlive us all.
So, I dropped off that brochure I did for the university... with their precious perforations.
While I was there, I picked up a Continuing Education bulletin.
Why did you circle all these cooking classes?
Why do you think?
I mean, isn't that what you always talked about?
Well, this is some kind of adult education workshop.
What I talked about was going full time to a culinary institute.
- Which we can't...
- Which we can't afford.
I know.
But that we can afford, so why are you closing your mind?
- Can we at least think about it?
- Okay.
Great.
- Hi.
- Hey.
So, did you hear that they're going to exterminate...
- Fourth period lunch?
- I didn't hear that.
It's just something people are obsessing about.
It's like sometimes people fill their minds with all these... stupid things, you know?
To keep themselves from thinking about, you know... what's really important.
Like this World Happiness Dance.
I mean, it's so stupid.
What does that even mean, you know?
Like if we dance the world is really going to get happier?
I mean, really, come on.
I don't think so.
There's a dance?
Yes, there's like five hundred posters up around the school about it.
Right.
I guess I kind of mean the idea of the dance is kind of false.
I mean, I doubt I'm even going.
I mean, I'm sure you're obviously not going.
Right?
- See, I have this philosophy.
- You have a philosophy?
If I go somewhere and someone I know is there... then cool, there's something natural about it.
But once you start making plans, then you have like... obligations and that basically blows.
So my feeling is, whatever happens, happens.
I have to say, I really respect that.
I forgot my geometry book in my locker, so...
- Hi.
- Hi.
I've been looking for you all day.
I've been really busy.
I'm carrying a triple minor.
I didn't even know you could have a triple minor.
They sort of bent the rules for me.
So...
Miss Chavatal wants me to catch up with the rest of the unit... since I just transferred here.
I have no idea what I'm even looking at.
Simple.
They're just paramecia.
Can I look?
Finally, an erection from actual physical contact.
What are the little hairy things around the edges?
Those are cilia.
They propel the paramecia.
You're a lifesaver.
So, remember when we were discussing wallpaper?
Okay, lower.
A little bit lower.
It's just so weird when you've chosen your wallpaper... and you think you're pretty happy with it... but every time you pass by the other wallpaper... the one that you sort of like more...
Brian, we're not talking about wallpaper here, are we?
Maybe not.
- Brian Krakow is here.
Good.
- Hi, I was just...
Helping, I know.
Thank you.
So, did you get a chance to look at that bulletin?
Not yet.
I should have mentioned, tomorrow's the last day...
- Of registration.
So...
- That's all right.
I'll do it next time.
Because you know, there are some very important chefs...
- Running some of the these classes.
- Sure, like who?
- Stephan Dieter.
- Who?
You know, that guy from the TV show.
Stephan's Kitchen.
- That guy died.
- He did not die.
Are you sure?
Graham, can I just say, I don't understand.
I thought that you planned to do this.
At this point the way things are now... it just doesn't feel right to make plans.
I'd rather let whatever happens, happen.
- So.
- So.
Have you thought about the dance?
Not much.
Have you?
No.
I mean, it's just that if I'm not going to work Saturday...
I have to, you know, switch with someone right away.
I see.
So, if I'm going to go, I would need to know now.
That's... yes.
- Rayanne's right.
- About what?
- Corey and the dance.
- She told you?
- It's okay, I understand.
- No, you don't understand.
I mean, you don't understand because you don't.
You couldn't...
You're right, Rickie.
I couldn't possibly understand having... an obsession for a person I have zero hope of ever becoming involved with.
We're hopeless.
And so in conclusion, I guess the truth is that I can't, you know... work twenty-four hours a day.
All work and no play, or whatever.
Brian, are you asking me to the dance?
- Yes.
- I thought so.
Angela, maybe we should go.
You know, to that stupid dance.
- Oh, my God, we should go together!
- Right.
Eight o'clock?
Eight o'clock!
I feel so much better, you know?
Just to know that it's settled.
Hey, Rickie.
So, see you Saturday right?
Excuse me?
Rayanne said the three of us are going to hang together.
At the dance?
Did I get that wrong?
No.
I mean, you got it completely right.
Cool.
So, Saturday.
So, I guess I should go with you and Rayanne and Corey, right?
Sure.
I mean, except that, you know, then it might seem like... you and I are together.
Like a boy-girl thing.
- It might?
- Yes, like a double date?
Yes, I guess it might.
Whereas if it's just me and Corey and Rayanne...
Wait a second!
Oh, my God, this is too obvious, isn't it?
I mean, maybe you should come.
No, I shouldn't.
You know, you're right.
I got to go find Rayanne.
Hi.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
It's kind of an emergency.
We were just...
No, it's okay.
I got to go anyway.
So, see you Saturday?
Yes.
- So you asked her to the dance?
- Yes.
In fact, I just wanted to go with someone, so I just thought her.
So I just asked.
It was, you know, that simple.
She seemed pretty much blown away.
That's great.
Look, this is going to sound really weird.
Rayanne's doing this thing for Rickie... because he has an enormous crush on someone... and it's just this very delicate balance.
And I know you're going with Delia, and I'm really happy for you...
And as she continued to basically babble, It started to sink In that... something truly amazing was happening.
I was thinking, that since we're neighbors, it'd be sort of convenient... if there was just some way I could go along...
When you stripped away all the blathering...
Angela Chase was asking to go to the dance with me.
I mean, just to get me there.
Not that we'd actually be going together.
Of course.
No.
I mean, not to go go, because you're going with Delia.
I just need a technical way to get there.
It's not a problem.
- I mean, fine.
Tag along.
- Thanks.
Can he excuse us?
- How could you do that?
- What did I do?
What did you do?
You invited Corey to the dance with you and me...
- When I specifically told you not to.
- Oh, that.
He painted your shoes.
- You want me to ask him to do yours?
- Rayanne!
Listen to me.
This isn't funny.
Now you've driven me crazy in the past, but I'm willing to overlook it... because the truth is, I want to go to the dance.
But if you say one word to embarrass me while the three of us are together...
- What?
- I won't be there.
What?
I just don't think I'm ready to go to an event like that.
I talked to the counselor, and she said she doesn't think I'd be able to.
Who cares about your stupid drinking problem?
This is my life!
- Don't worry, it's no problem.
- Yes, it is.
I will call Corey.
I will explain the whole thing.
It'll be fine.
Hi.
Did you want to talk to me?
Yes.
How are you?
Brian.
We only have a minute so...
Right.
So, it's sort of about the dance.
It turns out that I kind of forgot... about this other commitment that I already had.
It's kind of, you know, special or whatever, so I...
Of all the stupid things I've said, which are countless...
I've never wanted to take something back more than that one.
Maybe we can go catch a movie or whatever.
This other commitment, is it another girl or something?
Brian, look.
It doesn't matter who you told first.
You know, if it was her or it was me.
You should go with who you want to go with.
Just be honest with me, please?
Okay.
- So, I guess I would.
- You would what?
Rather go.
You know, with her.
I'm really sorry.
It would be really good if you would leave.
- Delia...
- Please?
I know this is weird, but just take a look at this?
So what does this mean?
So you enrolled me?
Yes.
I mean, I know that you've had your hands full... with the wallpaper and everything.
Graham, I just have this feeling like you're really going to enjoy this.
You signed me up...
Yes.
I know that sometimes it's hard for you to...
- What?
- Focus.
Graham, look.
I just thought...
I mean, I know you like to cook...
It's not that I like to cook.
It's this thing I can just do.
The one thing I can do.
- That's just the point, sweetheart...
- I'll get it!
Honey, I mean... ask who it is first.
- Who is it?
- Brlan Krakow.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
We're going to that dance thing.
I mean, we're actually not going with each other.
Oh, my God.
You know, when I want to, I can focus just fine.
So, we're picking Delia up?
Wait a second.
Your father is picking the three of you up... after the dance, right?
- As it turns out, Delia can't go.
- Wait a second.
Why?
It's her aunt actually.
She's actually in the hospital.
I hope it isn't anything too serious.
Graham?
I'm sorry, okay?
Graham?
Oh, my God.
This room looks amazing.
I guess we found another thing you can do.
You're welcome.
My God.
Did you see her face... when he told her that that other girl wasn't coming?
They're going to have such a terrible time.
Look...
I know you probably feel like you can't breathe sometimes... like I'm this horrible nag, or something.
Feel free to stop me any time.
Look, I'll put a stop on the check.
I'll call the registrar and just tell them...
Don't do that.
I sort of have to see if Stephan Dieter can still stiffen his egg whites.
I mean, since I'm already signed up.
I mean, thank you for signing me up.
So finally the mouse starts running across the classroom... and I swear to God, it starts chasing Mrs. Schindleheim... which is when she tripped over Nicholas Cayhill, which is why... she's wearing that neck brace.
You're really funny.
So, where's Rayanne?
- She didn't call you?
- No, why?
Well, she told me she was going to call you... because she's not coming.
Why?
It's kind of a long story.
- So she's not coming at all?
- No, sorry.
You don't have to be sorry.
I wanted to ask her how she liked her sneakers.
Well, Rayanne is very changeable.
It's just weird, you know... when you have a picture of how something is going to be... and it turns out completely different.
Yeah.
It is weird.
- Lot of people.
- Yes.
Okay, this is the simplest thing in the world.
People do It every day.
Just start a conversation.
Yes.
So, do you think you can get me something to drink?
- Okay.
What do you want?
- Just, you know, whatever.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.
So, you and Angela come together?
Sort of.
So I was thinking of hanging with you guys, but I didn't know... if you were here as friends, or as an actual thing, but... you know, it's whatever is better for you.
Whatever.
I mean, maybe you shouldn't come over.
We might want to dance or something.
That's really great.
- It's punch.
- Thanks.
- What did Rickie want?
- Nothing.
What did you say to him?
Nothing.
I just said it was better that maybe he didn't hang out with us.
- What?
- I thought that it might be awkward.
Rickie is my friend.
He's my friend, too.
It's just...
what if we...
I don't know...
If we wanted privacy or something?
- Why would we want privacy?
- We probably wouldn't, but...
Brian, what do you think is happening here?
What?
Nothing?
Didn't I explain what the whole reasoning for this was?
I just thought if we wanted to dance or something.
Why would...
we're not going to dance.
I realize that.
Look, it wasn't some big plan or anything.
I don't even believe in making plans.
Whatever happens, happens.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.
What did you say to Delia?
What do you mean?
You don't understand people, Krakow.
You're so heartless.
I mean, the fact that she called me heartless... that's just really good.
That's excellent.
How ironic can you get without puking?
I was really wrong.
I realize that now... that what I did was pretty heartless or whatever.
I am so glad you made it.
You know Kyle, right?
Yes.
Hi.
You know what, I am glad you decided to come on your own.
It's better.
There are so many really cute guys I want you to meet!
Okay?
So, Rayanne never called Corey.
Would you like me to kill her?
That's a really nice offer, but the truth is... that would only solve half the problem.
What's the other half?
The other half is, like, you know, the tough half.
Which is?
Which is like just, you know... that I belong nowhere, with no one.
That I don't fit.
I'm starving, man.
What do you think?
- Yes, let's go get something to eat.
- I've got to pick up Kimmy, too.
- She's getting out of work.
- Hey, Catalano, let's go, man.
We're going to Kathy's first, right?
There's a killer place I want to check out, too, later.
Yes, in a minute.
It's okay.
Go.
Hey.
- Why are you like this?
- Like what?
- Like how you are?
- Hey, Jordan, you coming or not?
How am I?
How am I?
I'll be right back.
Okay?
Yes.
Hi.
Brian, this was all my fault.
Her hair smelled Incredlble.
I mean, I ruined your night and Delia's night.
I should have stayed out of it.
Her hair smelled like this orange grove we passed when I was eight... on the way to see my grandmother.
And I can't really explain why I even got involved.
But I'm sorry.
But I guess that Is just her shampoo.
Or whatever.
These things are so stupid.
I know.
No one ever has a good time.
So, I don't know, you want to dance or something?
Not with you.
Well, I'm just...
I just...
I don't care about dancing that much.
Me either.
Brlan, honey?
Are you ignoring me, sweetheart?
If you are, lt's okay, J ust tell me,
My mother ls a behavioral psychologist, lf you left him alone, maybe he'd break out of this prolonged latency,
And my father ls a Freudlan psychiatrist,
- Our child ls not ln latency,
- Keep living ln denial, Bernlce,
Whlch basically means that they fundamentally disagree, on everything,
- Brl?
Everythlng all right?
- Feel free not to respond,
At Angela's house, they probably laugh and eat unbalanced meals, and talk about things that don't have deep symbolic meaning,
They're probably this like normal family,
- Child abuse!
- Well, it's tangled.
Where the hell is it?
Sweetie, I can't do braids in a basement.
- lt was right here.
- Fine, I'll do my braids myself.
So this is actually happening?
You're actually going to wallpaper the bedroom?
- Yes, what's the big deal?
- Nothing.
Except this wallpaper sat here through the entire Bush administration.
I just figure since I'm not working, you know, keep me off the streets.
So you feel okay about-- l mean, you've done this before, right?
- Patty, I can wallpaper a room.
- Right, I'm sorry.
This is really great.
I became yearbook photographer because I liked the idea, that I could sort of watch life without having to be a part of lt,
But when you are yearbook photographer, you are never ln the picture,
I'm yearbook photographer.
This is my job.
Brian, I'd like you to meet Delia.
She's new.
- lt's really nice meeting you.
- Yes.
Maybe I'll see you around?
- Bye.
- Bye.
- N ice, Krakow.
Real suave.
- What?
It was pretty obvious what she was thinking.
What?
She likes you.
Ask her to the dance!
Hold on, wait.
This World Happiness thing?
It's not a "thing".
It's a dance.
Which I am trying to make into a great dance.
Which is almost impossible since apparently the idea of school spirit... is out the window.
Wait, so getting back to this Delia thing...
She's working at Big Guy Burger tonight from 3: 30 until 8: 00.
Did she actually say anything?
Let's just say it was very clearly implied.
I mean, World Happiness!
Who thought of that?
- lt sounds like Sharon.
- Definitely Sharon.
- So, are you like going?
- What?
I know, I just thought in this really obvious way it'd be sort of fun.
Angela, if you expect Jordan Catalano to ask you...
- Maybe she just wants to dance.
- Exactly.
Wait, so there's no chance?
Angela, Jordan Catalano doesn't go to school dances.
- As, like, policy.
- Right. I sort of figured.
So... I mean, if you wanted to go, which of course you don't... you could let Brian Krakow ask you.
- Rayanne!
- What?
If you don't get Catalano, you've got Brian Krakow to pay.
Then excuse me, I'd be at the dance with Brian Krakow.
- Excuse me?
- Can we help you?
I was just-- ls M iss Chavatal around?
Do you see M iss Chavatal?
Cool vest.
What has always amazed me, ls fishermen,
How they wait there forever, and when something finally tugs on their line, they don't panic,
The strange thing ls, even though I've established verbal communication with Della Flsher, I still think about Angela, constantly,
Why am I like this?
I truly slcken myself, I just have to stop being her little puppet, I vow to never again, to show up at Angela's door with some lame excuse,
H i. l mean, hello.
I sort of lent this atlas to Angela... which she was technically supposed to return in March.
So...
Well, she isn't here now.
- Could you...
- Right.
Right.
So, putting up wallpaper?
Lower, lower.
Wait.
The morning glories aren't lined up.
I n my room, one seam is a little off and I stare at it constantly.
It's like destroying me.
So, you're like what, retired?
I mean, I mean, not retired.
No. I'm sort of planning what to do next.
I don't want to jump into anything blindly.
I mean, it's like wallpaper.
I mean, there are hundreds of patterns out there, and it's kind of daunting... because you're going to have to live with your decision for a long time.
Let's say you're deciding between two particular patterns... and one of them, you definitely know that you really like... and the other is nice wallpaper and all, but just you're not sure if it's really...
- For you.
- Exactly.
But the really great wallpaper... let's say, is totally out of your price range.
Do you take the other wallpaper, even though you don't, let's say... really desire it that much, or do you wait until... the really great wallpaper is cheaper.
I guess it depends on how badly you need wallpaper.
- l would say pretty badly.
- l guess that says it.
Yes.
I can't believe this,
Apparently Della Flsher smiles at everyone,
She's probably from one of those small towns, friendly and smiles at you for no reason, I hate that type of town,
Napkins.
Thanks for choosing Big Guy.
- H i.
- H i.
Welcome to Big Guy Burger, where every guy is a big guy.
I was just, you know, happened to be in the neighborhood, and so...
So, what can I get for you?
- J ust a H unkburger.
- For here or to go?
I guess to go. I just, you know, should probably go.
There's something about my life, lt's just automatically true that nothing actually happens,
Not hungry after all?
I was told not to eat red meat by my doctor.
So...
Sorry about being so standard in there.
My manager watches us.
- Right.
- l'm glad you came.
Somewhere far away there was a car alarm,
One of those really annoying ones,
Do you want a sip?
But suddenly, lt was the best sound I had ever heard,
So, I guess I should go.
Me, too.
So maybe this is what people mean... when they talk about, you know, life.
So are you going to ask me to this dance, or what?
I was going to, eventually.
So you just haven't gotten around to it?
Exactly.
Look, Kyle. I am under a ton of pressure here, okay?
The dance committee, student council, yearbook, band.
I don't have time to worry about being alone at the very dance I organized!
Fine.
Would you like to go to the dance with me?
Yes.
And if you screw this up, I will really hate you.
Like forever.
My life ls so ridiculous, I have to ask Della Flsher to the dance, I have to,
And I'll do lt now, On the count of three,
One, Two, Three,
- l got to run. I'll catch you later.
- Okay.
Speak!
- Hey.
What's going on?
- Not much.
- So.
You going to the dance?
- Doubtful.
You?
I would kind of have to say, at this point, no.
Guidance is so weird.
So she looked at me all concerned... wanting to know if I was going to the school dance... like that wasn't the stupidest question in history.
And so, I broke down and cried.
It was hysterical.
But, I mean, how's it going?
I mean, how're you doing?
Ten days.
No drink, no drugs.
I'm so clean you could eat off me.
- So, you know that girl, Pam Troy?
- The one with the really bad perm?
No, the one with the diamond stud in her nose.
The one with the crop- tops and... she broke down and cried that time in H uman Sexuality?
Yes, so?
So I was thinking of asking her to the dance.
Why?
I know you think the dance is really stupid...
- Why don't you ask him?
- Shut up!
Well, isn't that who you really want to go with?
Isn't it?
Yes, in some imaginary universe that exists in my mind, but...
Leave it to me.
Rayanne, if you say one word to him, I'd kill you.
Rayanne!
My.
Are those morning glories not lining up?
They're lining up.
Because if they're even the slightest bit off... that's all you're ever going to notice.
is that a bubble?
Patty, I tried every conceivable way to get rid of that bubble.
It is there forever, it's part of our lives.
It will outlive us all.
So, I dropped off that brochure I did for the university... with their precious perforations.
While I was there, I picked up a Continuing Education bulletin.
Why did you circle all these cooking classes?
Why do you think?
I mean, isn't that what you always talked about?
Well, this is some kind of adult education workshop.
What I talked about was going full time to a culinary institute.
- Which we can't--
- Which we can't afford. I know.
But that we can afford, so why are you closing your mind?
- Can we at least think about it?
- Okay.
Great.
- H i.
- Hey.
So, did you hear that they're going to exterminate...
- fourth period lunch?
- l didn't hear that.
It's just something people are obsessing about.
It's like sometimes people fill their minds with all these... stupid things, you know?
To keep themselves from thinking about, you know... what's really important.
Like this World Happiness Dance.
I mean, it's so stupid.
What does that even mean, you know?
Like if we dance the world is really going to get happier?
I mean, really, come on.
I don't think so.
There's a dance?
Yes, there's like five hundred posters up around the school about it.
Right.
I guess I kind of mean the idea of the dance is kind of false.
I mean, I doubt I'm even going.
I mean, I'm sure you're obviously not going.
Right?
- See, I have this philosophy.
- You have a philosophy?
If I go somewhere and someone I know is there... then cool, there's something natural about it.
But once you start making plans, then you have like... obligations and that basically blows.
So my feeling is, whatever happens, happens.
I have to say, I really respect that.
I forgot my geometry book in my locker, so...
- H i.
- H i.
I've been looking for you all day.
I've been really busy.
I'm carrying a triple minor.
I didn't even know you could have a triple minor.
They sort of bent the rules for me.
So...
M iss Chavatal wants me to catch up with the rest of the unit... since I just transferred here.
I have no idea what I'm even looking at.
Simple.
They're just paramecia.
Can I look?
Flnally, an erection from actual physical contact,
What are the little hairy things around the edges?
Those are cilia.
They propel the paramecia.
You're a lifesaver.
So, remember when we were discussing wallpaper?
Okay, lower.
A little bit lower.
It's just so weird when you've chosen your wallpaper... and you think you're pretty happy with it... but every time you pass by the other wallpaper... the one that you sort of like more...
Brian, we're not talking about wallpaper here, are we?
Maybe not.
- Brian Krakow is here.
Good.
- H i, I was just...
Helping, I know.
Thank you.
So, did you get a chance to look at that bulletin?
Not yet.
I should have mentioned, tomorrow's the last day...
- of registration.
So...
- That's all right. I'll do it next time.
Because you know, there are some very important chefs...
- running some of the these classes.
- Sure, like who?
- Stephan Dieter.
- Who?
You know, that guy from the TV show.
Stephan's Kitchen.
- That guy died.
- He did not die.
Are you sure?
Graham, can I just say, I don't understand.
I thought that you planned to do this.
At this point the way things are now... it just doesn't feel right to make plans.
I'd rather let whatever happens, happen.
- So.
- So.
Have you thought about the dance?
Not much.
Have you?
No. I mean, it's just that if I'm not going to work Saturday... I have to, you know, switch with someone right away.
I see.
So, if I'm going to go, I would need to know now.
That's-- yes.
- Rayanne's right.
- About what?
- Corey and the dance.
- She told you?
- lt's okay, I understand.
- No, you don't understand.
I mean, you don't understand because you don't.
You couldn't...
You're right, Rickie. I couldn't possibly understand having... an obsession for a person I have zero hope of ever becoming involved with.
We're hopeless.
And so in conclusion, I guess the truth is that I can't, you know... work twenty- four hours a day.
All work and no play, or whatever.
Brian, are you asking me to the dance?
- Yes.
- l thought so.
Angela, maybe we should go.
You know, to that stupid dance.
- Oh, my God, we should go together!
- Right.
Eight o'clock?
Eight o'clock!
I feel so much better, you know?
J ust to know that it's settled.
Hey, Rickie.
So, see you Saturday right?
Excuse me?
Rayanne said the three of us are going to hang together.
At the dance?
Did I get that wrong?
No. I mean, you got it completely right.
Cool.
So, Saturday.
So, I guess I should go with you and Rayanne and Corey, right?
Sure. I mean, except that, you know, then it might seem like... you and I are together.
Like a boy- girl thing.
- lt might?
- Yes, like a double date?
Yes, I guess it might.
Whereas if it's just me and Corey and Rayanne--
Wait a second!
Oh, my God, this is too obvious, isn't it?
I mean, maybe you should come.
No, I shouldn't.
You know, you're right.
I got to go find Rayanne.
H i.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
It's kind of an emergency.
We were just...
No, it's okay. I got to go anyway.
So, see you Saturday?
Yes.
- So you asked her to the dance?
- Yes.
I n fact, I just wanted to go with someone, so I just thought her.
So I just asked.
It was, you know, that simple.
She seemed pretty much blown away.
That's great.
Look, this is going to sound really weird.
Rayanne's doing this thing for Rickie... because he has an enormous crush on someone... and it's just this very delicate balance.
And I know you're going with Delia, and I'm really happy for you...
And as she continued to basically babble, lt started to sink ln that, something truly amazing was happening, I was thinking, that since we're neighbors, it'd be sort of convenient... if there was just some way I could go along...
When you stripped away all the blathering,
Angela Chase was asking to go to the dance with me, I mean, just to get me there.
Not that we'd actually be going together.
Of course.
No. I mean, not to go go, because you're going with Delia.
I just need a technical way to get there.
It's not a problem.
- l mean, fine.
Tag along.
- Thanks.
Can he excuse us?
- How could you do that?
- What did I do?
What did you do?
You invited Corey to the dance with you and me...
- when I specifically told you not to.
- Oh, that.
He painted your shoes.
- You want me to ask him to do yours?
- Rayanne!
Listen to me.
This isn't funny.
Now you've driven me crazy in the past, but I'm willing to overlook it... because the truth is, I want to go to the dance.
But if you say one word to embarrass me while the three of us are together...
- What?
- l won't be there.
What?
I just don't think I'm ready to go to an event like that.
I talked to the counselor, and she said she doesn't think I'd be able to.
Who cares about your stupid drinking problem?
This is my life!
- Don't worry, it's no problem.
- Yes, it is.
I will call Corey. I will explain the whole thing. lt'll be fine.
H i.
Did you want to talk to me?
Yes.
How are you?
Brian.
We only have a minute so...
Right.
So, it's sort of about the dance.
It turns out that I kind of forgot... about this other commitment that I already had.
It's kind of, you know, special or whatever, so I...
Of all the stupid things I've said, which are countless, I've never wanted to take something back more than that one,
Maybe we can go catch a movie or whatever.
This other commitment, is it another girl or something?
Brian, look. lt doesn't matter who you told first.
You know, if it was her or it was me.
You should go with who you want to go with.
J ust be honest with me, please?
Okay.
- So, I guess I would.
- You would what?
Rather go.
You know, with her.
I'm really sorry.
It would be really good if you would leave.
- Delia...
- Please?
I know this is weird, but just take a look at this?
So what does this mean?
So you enrolled me?
Yes. I mean, I know that you've had your hands full... with the wallpaper and everything.
Graham, I just have this feeling like you're really going to enjoy this.
You signed me up...
Yes.
I know that sometimes it's hard for you to...
- What?
- Focus.
Graham, look.
I just thought-- l mean, I know you like to cook... lt's not that I like to cook.
It's this thing I can just do.
The one thing I can do.
- That's just the point, sweetheart...
- l'll get it!
Honey, I mean-- ask who it is first.
- Who is it?
- Brlan Krakow,
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
We're going to that dance thing.
I mean, we're actually not going with each other.
Oh, my God.
You know, when I want to, I can focus just fine.
So, we're picking Delia up?
Wait a second.
Your father is picking the three of you up... after the dance, right?
- As it turns out, Delia can't go.
- Wait a second.
Why?
It's her aunt actually.
She's actually in the hospital.
I hope it isn't anything too serious.
Graham?
I'm sorry, okay?
Graham?
Oh, my God.
This room looks amazing.
I guess we found another thing you can do.
You're welcome.
My God.
Did you see her face... when he told her that that other girl wasn't coming?
They're going to have such a terrible time.
Look... I know you probably feel like you can't breathe sometimes... like I'm this horrible nag, or something.
Feel free to stop me any time.
Look, I'll put a stop on the check.
I'll call the registrar and just tell them--
Don't do that.
I sort of have to see if Stephan Dieter can still stiffen his egg whites.
I mean, since I'm already signed up.
I mean, thank you for signing me up.
So finally the mouse starts running across the classroom... and I swear to God, it starts chasing M rs.
Schindleheim... which is when she tripped over N icholas Cayhill, which is why... she's wearing that neck brace.
You're really funny.
So, where's Rayanne?
- She didn't call you?
- No, why?
Well, she told me she was going to call you... because she's not coming.
Why?
It's kind of a long story.
- So she's not coming at all?
- No, sorry.
You don't have to be sorry.
I wanted to ask her how she liked her sneakers.
Well, Rayanne is very changeable.
It's just weird, you know... when you have a picture of how something is going to be... and it turns out completely different.
Yeah. lt is weird.
- Lot of people.
- Yes.
Okay, this ls the simplest thing ln the world,
People do lt every day, J ust start a conversation,
Yes.
So, do you think you can get me something to drink?
- Okay.
What do you want?
- J ust, you know, whatever.
- H i.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.
So, you and Angela come together?
Sort of.
So I was thinking of hanging with you guys, but I didn't know... if you were here as friends, or as an actual thing, but... you know, it's whatever is better for you.
Whatever.
I mean, maybe you shouldn't come over.
We might want to dance or something.
That's really great.
- lt's punch.
- Thanks.
- What did Rickie want?
- Nothing.
What did you say to him?
Nothing. I just said it was better that maybe he didn't hang out with us.
- What?
- l thought that it might be awkward.
Rickie is my friend.
He's my friend, too. lt's just-- what if we-- l don't know-- lf we wanted privacy or something?
- Why would we want privacy?
- We probably wouldn't, but...
Brian, what do you think is happening here?
What?
Nothing?
Didn't I explain what the whole reasoning for this was?
I just thought if we wanted to dance or something.
Why would-- we're not going to dance.
I realize that.
Look, it wasn't some big plan or anything.
I don't even believe in making plans.
Whatever happens, happens.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.
What did you say to Delia?
What do you mean?
You don't understand people, Krakow.
You're so heartless.
I mean, the fact that she called me heartless... that's just really good.
That's excellent.
How ironic can you get without puking?
I was really wrong.
I realize that now... that what I did was pretty heartless or whatever.
I am so glad you made it.
You know Kyle, right?
Yes.
H i.
You know what, I am glad you decided to come on your own.
It's better.
There are so many really cute guys I want you to meet!
Okay?
So, Rayanne never called Corey.
Would you like me to kill her?
That's a really nice offer, but the truth is... that would only solve half the problem.
What's the other half?
The other half is, like, you know, the tough half.
Which is?
Which is like just, you know... that I belong nowhere, with no one.
That I don't fit.
I'm starving, man.
What do you think?
- Yes, let's go get something to eat.
- l've got to pick up Kimmy, too.
- She's getting out of work.
- Hey, Catalano, let's go, man.
We're going to Kathy's first, right?
There's a killer place I want to check out, too, later.
Yes, in a minute.
It's okay.
Go.
Hey.
- Why are you like this?
- Like what?
- Like how you are?
- Hey, Jordan, you coming or not?
How am I?
How am I?
I'll be right back.
Okay?
Yes.
H i.
Brian, this was all my fault.
Her hair smelled incredible, I mean, I ruined your night and Delia's night.
I should have stayed out of it.
Her hair smelled like this orange grove we passed when I was eight, on the way to see my grandmother,
And I can't really explain why I even got involved.
But I'm sorry.
But I guess that ls just her shampoo, Or whatever,
These things are so stupid.
I know.
No one ever has a good time.
So, I don't know, you want to dance or something?
Not with you.
Well, I'm just... I just...
I don't care about dancing that much.
Me either.
Brlan, honey?
Are you ignoring me, sweetheart?
If you are, lt's okay, J ust tell me,
My mother ls a behavioral psychologist, lf you left him alone, maybe he'd break out of this prolonged latency,
And my father ls a Freudlan psychiatrist,
- Our child ls not ln latency,
- Keep living ln denial, Bernlce,
Whlch basically means that they fundamentally disagree, , , on everything,
- Brl?
Everythlng all right?
- Feel free not to respond,
At Angela's house, they probably laugh and eat unbalanced meals, , , and talk about things that don't have deep symbolic meaning,
They're probably this like normal family,
- Child abuse!
- Well, it's tangled.
Where the hell is it?
Sweetie, I can't do braids in a basement.
- lt was right here.
- Fine, I'll do my braids myself.
So this is actually happening?
You're actually going to wallpaper the bedroom?
- Yes, what's the big deal?
- Nothing.
Except this wallpaper sat here through the entire Bush administration.
I just figure since I'm not working, you know, keep me off the streets.
So you feel okay about-- l mean, you've done this before, right?
- Patty, I can wallpaper a room.
- Right, I'm sorry.
This is really great.
I became yearbook photographer because I liked the idea, , , that I could sort of watch life without having to be a part of lt,
But when you are yearbook photographer, , , you are never ln the picture,
I'm yearbook photographer.
This is my job.
Brian, I'd like you to meet Delia.
She's new.
- lt's really nice meeting you.
- Yes.
Maybe I'll see you around?
- Bye.
- Bye.
- N ice, Krakow.
Real suave.
- What?
It was pretty obvious what she was thinking.
What?
She likes you.
Ask her to the dance!
Hold on, wait.
This World Happiness thing?
It's not a "thing".
It's a dance.
Which I am trying to make into a great dance.
Which is almost impossible since apparently the idea of school spirit...
is out the window.
Wait, so getting back to this Delia thing...
She's working at Big Guy Burger tonight from 3: 30 until 8: 00.
Did she actually say anything?
Let's just say it was very clearly implied.
I mean, World Happiness!
Who thought of that?
- lt sounds like Sharon.
- Definitely Sharon.
- So, are you like going?
- What?
I know, I just thought in this really obvious way it'd be sort of fun.
Angela, if you expect Jordan Catalano to ask you...
- Maybe she just wants to dance.
- Exactly.
Wait, so there's no chance?
Angela, Jordan Catalano doesn't go to school dances.
- As, like, policy.
- Right. I sort of figured.
So...
I mean, if you wanted to go, which of course you don't...
you could let Brian Krakow ask you.
- Rayanne!
- What?
If you don't get Catalano, you've got Brian Krakow to pay.
Then excuse me, I'd be at the dance with Brian Krakow.
- Excuse me?
- Can we help you?
I was just-- ls M iss Chavatal around?
Do you see M iss Chavatal?
Cool vest.
What has always amazed me, ls fishermen,
How they wait there forever, , , and when something finally tugs on their line, they don't panic,
The strange thing ls, , , even though I've established verbal communication with Della Flsher, , , I still think about Angela, constantly,
Why am I like this?
I truly slcken myself, I just have to stop being her little puppet, I vow to never again, , , to show up at Angela's door with some lame excuse,
H i. l mean, hello.
I sort of lent this atlas to Angela...
which she was technically supposed to return in March.
So...
Well, she isn't here now.
- Could you...
- Right.
Right.
So, putting up wallpaper?
Lower, lower.
Wait.
The morning glories aren't lined up.
I n my room, one seam is a little off and I stare at it constantly.
It's like destroying me.
So, you're like what, retired?
I mean, I mean, not retired.
No. I'm sort of planning what to do next.
I don't want to jump into anything blindly.
I mean, it's like wallpaper.
I mean, there are hundreds of patterns out there, and it's kind of daunting...
because you're going to have to live with your decision for a long time.
Let's say you're deciding between two particular patterns...
and one of them, you definitely know that you really like...
and the other is nice wallpaper and all, but just you're not sure if it's really...
- For you.
- Exactly.
But the really great wallpaper...
let's say, is totally out of your price range.
Do you take the other wallpaper, even though you don't, let's say...
really desire it that much, or do you wait until...
the really great wallpaper is cheaper.
I guess it depends on how badly you need wallpaper.
- l would say pretty badly.
- l guess that says it.
Yes.
I can't believe this,
Apparently Della Flsher smiles at everyone,
She's probably from one of those small towns, , , friendly and smiles at you for no reason, I hate that type of town,
Napkins.
Thanks for choosing Big Guy.
- H i.
- H i.
Welcome to Big Guy Burger, where every guy is a big guy.
I was just, you know, happened to be in the neighborhood, and so...
So, what can I get for you?
- J ust a H unkburger.
- For here or to go?
I guess to go. I just, you know, should probably go.
There's something about my life, lt's just automatically true that nothing actually happens,
Not hungry after all?
I was told not to eat red meat by my doctor.
So...
Sorry about being so standard in there.
My manager watches us.
- Right.
- l'm glad you came.
Somewhere far away there was a car alarm,
One of those really annoying ones,
Do you want a sip?
But suddenly, lt was the best sound I had ever heard,
So, I guess I should go.
Me, too.
So maybe this is what people mean...
when they talk about, you know, life.
So are you going to ask me to this dance, or what?
I was going to, eventually.
So you just haven't gotten around to it?
Exactly.
Look, Kyle. I am under a ton of pressure here, okay?
The dance committee, student council, yearbook, band.
I don't have time to worry about being alone at the very dance I organized !
Fine.
Would you like to go to the dance with me?
Yes.
And if you screw this up, I will really hate you.
Like forever.
My life ls so ridiculous, I have to ask Della Flsher to the dance, I have to,
And I'll do lt now, On the count of three,
One, Two, Three,
- l got to run. I'll catch you later.
- Okay.
Speak!
- Hey.
What's going on?
- Not much.
- So.
You going to the dance?
- Doubtful.
You?
I would kind of have to say, at this point, no.
Guidance is so weird.
So she looked at me all concerned...
wanting to know if I was going to the school dance...
like that wasn't the stupidest question in history.
And so, I broke down and cried.
It was hysterical.
But, I mean, how's it going?
I mean, how're you doing?
Ten days.
No drink, no drugs.
I'm so clean you could eat off me.
- So, you know that girl, Pam Troy?
- The one with the really bad perm?
No, the one with the diamond stud in her nose.
The one with the crop-tops and...
she broke down and cried that time in H uman Sexuality?
Yes, so?
So I was thinking of asking her to the dance.
Why?
I know you think the dance is really stupid...
- Why don't you ask him?
- Shut up!
Well, isn't that who you really want to go with?
Isn't it?
Yes, in some imaginary universe that exists in my mind, but...
Leave it to me.
Rayanne, if you say one word to him, I'd kill you.
Rayanne!
My.
Are those morning glories not lining up?
They're lining up.
Because if they're even the slightest bit off...
that's all you're ever going to notice.
is that a bubble?
Patty, I tried every conceivable way to get rid of that bubble.
It is there forever, it's part of our lives.
It will outlive us all.
So, I dropped off that brochure I did for the university...
with their precious perforations.
While I was there, I picked up a Continuing Education bulletin.
Why did you circle all these cooking classes?
Why do you think?
I mean, isn't that what you always talked about?
Well, this is some kind of adult education workshop.
What I talked about was going full time to a culinary institute.
- Which we can't--
- Which we can't afford. I know.
But that we can afford, so why are you closing your mind?
- Can we at least think about it?
- Okay.
Great.
- H i.
- Hey.
So, did you hear that they're going to exterminate...
- fourth period lunch?
- l didn't hear that.
It's just something people are obsessing about.
It's like sometimes people fill their minds with all these...
stupid things, you know?
To keep themselves from thinking about, you know...
what's really important.
Like this World Happiness Dance.
I mean, it's so stupid.
What does that even mean, you know?
Like if we dance the world is really going to get happier?
I mean, really, come on.
I don't think so.
There's a dance?
Yes, there's like five hundred posters up around the school about it.
Right.
I guess I kind of mean the idea of the dance is kind of false.
I mean, I doubt I'm even going.
I mean, I'm sure you're obviously not going.
Right?
- See, I have this philosophy.
- You have a philosophy?
If I go somewhere and someone I know is there...
then cool, there's something natural about it.
But once you start making plans, then you have like...
obligations and that basically blows.
So my feeling is, whatever happens, happens.
I have to say, I really respect that.
I forgot my geometry book in my locker, so...
- H i.
- H i.
I've been looking for you all day.
I've been really busy.
I'm carrying a triple minor.
I didn't even know you could have a triple minor.
They sort of bent the rules for me.
So...
M iss Chavatal wants me to catch up with the rest of the unit...
since I just transferred here.
I have no idea what I'm even looking at.
Simple.
They're just paramecia.
Can I look?
Flnally, an erection from actual physical contact,
What are the little hairy things around the edges?
Those are cilia.
They propel the paramecia.
You're a lifesaver.
So, remember when we were discussing wallpaper?
Okay, lower.
A little bit lower.
It's just so weird when you've chosen your wallpaper...
and you think you're pretty happy with it...
but every time you pass by the other wallpaper...
the one that you sort of like more...
Brian, we're not talking about wallpaper here, are we?
Maybe not.
- Brian Krakow is here.
Good.
- H i, I was just...
Helping, I know.
Thank you.
So, did you get a chance to look at that bulletin?
Not yet.
I should have mentioned, tomorrow's the last day...
- of registration.
So...
- That's all right. I'll do it next time.
Because you know, there are some very important chefs...
- running some of the these classes.
- Sure, like who?
- Stephan Dieter.
- Who?
You know, that guy from the TV show.
Stephan's Kitchen.
- That guy died.
- He did not die.
Are you sure?
Graham, can I just say, I don't understand.
I thought that you planned to do this.
At this point the way things are now...
it just doesn't feel right to make plans.
I'd rather let whatever happens, happen.
- So.
- So.
Have you thought about the dance?
Not much.
Have you?
No. I mean, it's just that if I'm not going to work Saturday...
I have to, you know, switch with someone right away.
I see.
So, if I'm going to go, I would need to know now.
That's-- yes.
- Rayanne's right.
- About what?
- Corey and the dance.
- She told you?
- lt's okay, I understand.
- No, you don't understand.
I mean, you don't understand because you don't.
You couldn't...
You're right, Rickie. I couldn't possibly understand having...
an obsession for a person I have zero hope of ever becoming involved with.
We're hopeless.
And so in conclusion, I guess the truth is that I can't, you know...
work twenty-four hours a day.
All work and no play, or whatever.
Brian, are you asking me to the dance?
- Yes.
- l thought so.
Angela, maybe we should go.
You know, to that stupid dance.
- Oh, my God, we should go together!
- Right.
Eight o'clock?
Eight o'clock!
I feel so much better, you know?
J ust to know that it's settled.
Hey, Rickie.
So, see you Saturday right?
Excuse me?
Rayanne said the three of us are going to hang together.
At the dance?
Did I get that wrong?
No. I mean, you got it completely right.
Cool.
So, Saturday.
So, I guess I should go with you and Rayanne and Corey, right?
Sure. I mean, except that, you know, then it might seem like...
you and I are together.
Like a boy-girl thing.
- lt might?
- Yes, like a double date?
Yes, I guess it might.
Whereas if it's just me and Corey and Rayanne--
Wait a second !
Oh, my God, this is too obvious, isn't it?
I mean, maybe you should come.
No, I shouldn't.
You know, you're right.
I got to go find Rayanne.
H i.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
It's kind of an emergency.
We were just...
No, it's okay. I got to go anyway.
So, see you Saturday?
Yes.
- So you asked her to the dance?
- Yes.
I n fact, I just wanted to go with someone, so I just thought her.
So I just asked.
It was, you know, that simple.
She seemed pretty much blown away.
That's great.
Look, this is going to sound really weird.
Rayanne's doing this thing for Rickie...
because he has an enormous crush on someone...
and it's just this very delicate balance.
And I know you're going with Delia, and I'm really happy for you...
And as she continued to basically babble, lt started to sink ln that, , , something truly amazing was happening, I was thinking, that since we're neighbors, it'd be sort of convenient...
if there was just some way I could go along...
When you stripped away all the blathering, , ,
Angela Chase was asking to go to the dance with me, I mean, just to get me there.
Not that we'd actually be going together.
Of course.
No. I mean, not to go go, because you're going with Delia.
I just need a technical way to get there.
It's not a problem.
- l mean, fine.
Tag along.
- Thanks.
Can he excuse us?
- How could you do that?
- What did I do?
What did you do?
You invited Corey to the dance with you and me...
- when I specifically told you not to.
- Oh, that.
He painted your shoes.
- You want me to ask him to do yours?
- Rayanne!
Listen to me.
This isn't funny.
Now you've driven me crazy in the past, but I'm willing to overlook it...
because the truth is, I want to go to the dance.
But if you say one word to embarrass me while the three of us are together...
- What?
- l won't be there.
What?
I just don't think I'm ready to go to an event like that.
I talked to the counselor, and she said she doesn't think I'd be able to.
Who cares about your stupid drinking problem?
This is my life!
- Don't worry, it's no problem.
- Yes, it is.
I will call Corey. I will explain the whole thing. lt'll be fine.
H i.
Did you want to talk to me?
Yes.
How are you?
Brian.
We only have a minute so...
Right.
So, it's sort of about the dance.
It turns out that I kind of forgot...
about this other commitment that I already had.
It's kind of, you know, special or whatever, so I ...
Of all the stupid things I've said, which are countless, , , I've never wanted to take something back more than that one,
Maybe we can go catch a movie or whatever.
This other commitment, is it another girl or something?
Brian, look. lt doesn't matter who you told first.
You know, if it was her or it was me.
You should go with who you want to go with.
J ust be honest with me, please?
Okay.
- So, I guess I would.
- You would what?
Rather go.
You know, with her.
I'm really sorry.
It would be really good if you would leave.
- Delia...
- Please?
I know this is weird, but just take a look at this?
So what does this mean?
So you enrolled me?
Yes. I mean, I know that you've had your hands full...
with the wallpaper and everything.
Graham, I just have this feeling like you're really going to enjoy this.
You signed me up...
Yes.
I know that sometimes it's hard for you to...
- What?
- Focus.
Graham, look.
I just thought-- l mean, I know you like to cook...
It's not that I like to cook.
It's this thing I can just do.
The one thing I can do.
- That's just the point, sweetheart...
- l'll get it!
Honey, I mean-- ask who it is first.
- Who is it?
- Brlan Krakow,
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
We're going to that dance thing.
I mean, we're actually not going with each other.
Oh, my God.
You know, when I want to, I can focus just fine.
So, we're picking Delia up?
Wait a second.
Your father is picking the three of you up...
after the dance, right?
- As it turns out, Delia can't go.
- Wait a second.
Why?
It's her aunt actually.
She's actually in the hospital.
I hope it isn't anything too serious.
Graham?
I'm sorry, okay?
Graham?
Oh, my God.
This room looks amazing.
I guess we found another thing you can do.
You're welcome.
My God.
Did you see her face...
when he told her that that other girl wasn't coming?
They're going to have such a terrible time.
Look...
I know you probably feel like you can't breathe sometimes...
like I'm this horrible nag, or something.
Feel free to stop me any time.
Look, I'll put a stop on the check.
I'll call the registrar and just tell them--
Don't do that.
I sort of have to see if Stephan Dieter can still stiffen his egg whites.
I mean, since I'm already signed up.
I mean, thank you for signing me up.
So finally the mouse starts running across the classroom...
and I swear to God, it starts chasing M rs.
Schindleheim...
which is when she tripped over N icholas Cayhill, which is why...
she's wearing that neck brace.
You're really funny.
So, where's Rayanne?
- She didn't call you?
- No, why?
Well, she told me she was going to call you...
because she's not coming.
Why?
It's kind of a long story.
- So she's not coming at all?
- No, sorry.
You don't have to be sorry.
I wanted to ask her how she liked her sneakers.
Well, Rayanne is very changeable.
It's just weird, you know...
when you have a picture of how something is going to be...
and it turns out completely different.
Yeah. lt is weird.
- Lot of people.
- Yes.
Okay, this ls the simplest thing ln the world,
People do lt every day, J ust start a conversation,
Yes.
So, do you think you can get me something to drink?
- Okay.
What do you want?
- J ust, you know, whatever.
- H i.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.
So, you and Angela come together?
Sort of.
So I was thinking of hanging with you guys, but I didn't know...
if you were here as friends, or as an actual thing, but...
you know, it's whatever is better for you.
Whatever.
I mean, maybe you shouldn't come over.
We might want to dance or something.
That's really great.
- lt's punch.
- Thanks.
- What did Rickie want?
- Nothing.
What did you say to him?
Nothing. I just said it was better that maybe he didn't hang out with us.
- What?
- l thought that it might be awkward.
Rickie is my friend.
He's my friend, too. lt's just-- what if we-- l don't know-- lf we wanted privacy or something?
- Why would we want privacy?
- We probably wouldn't, but...
Brian, what do you think is happening here?
What?
Nothing?
Didn't I explain what the whole reasoning for this was?
I just thought if we wanted to dance or something.
Why would-- we're not going to dance.
I realize that.
Look, it wasn't some big plan or anything.
I don't even believe in making plans.
Whatever happens, happens.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.
What did you say to Delia?
What do you mean?
You don't understand people, Krakow.
You're so heartless.
I mean, the fact that she called me heartless...
that's just really good.
That's excellent.
How ironic can you get without puking?
I was really wrong.
I realize that now...
that what I did was pretty heartless or whatever.
I am so glad you made it.
You know Kyle, right?
Yes.
H i.
You know what, I am glad you decided to come on your own.
It's better.
There are so many really cute guys I want you to meet!
Okay?
So, Rayanne never called Corey.
Would you like me to kill her?
That's a really nice offer, but the truth is...
that would only solve half the problem.
What's the other half?
The other half is, like, you know, the tough half.
Which is?
Which is like just, you know...
that I belong nowhere, with no one.
That I don't fit.
I'm starving, man.
What do you think?
- Yes, let's go get something to eat.
- l've got to pick up Kimmy, too.
- She's getting out of work.
- Hey, Catalano, let's go, man.
We're going to Kathy's first, right?
There's a killer place I want to check out, too, later.
Yes, in a minute.
It's okay.
Go.
Hey.
- Why are you like this?
- Like what?
- Like how you are?
- Hey, Jordan, you coming or not?
How am I?
How am I?
I'll be right back.
Okay?
Yes.
H i.
Brian, this was all my fault.
Her hair smelled incredible, I mean, I ruined your night and Delia's night.
I should have stayed out of it.
Her hair smelled like this orange grove we passed when I was eight, , , on the way to see my grandmother,
And I can't really explain why I even got involved.
But I'm sorry.
But I guess that ls just her shampoo, Or whatever,
These things are so stupid.
I know.
No one ever has a good time.
So, I don't know, you want to dance or something?
Not with you.
Well, I'm just...
I just...
I don'tcare about dancing that much.
Me either.
Brlan, honey?
Are you Ignoring me, sweetheart?
If you are, It's okay.
Just tell me.
My mother Is a behavioral psychologist.
If you left him alone, maybe he'd break out of this prolonged latency.
And my father Is a Freudlan psychiatrist.
- Our child is not in latency.
- Keep living in denial, Bernice.
Which basically means that they fundamentally disagree... on everything.
- Brl?
Everything all right?
- Feel free not to respond.
At Angela's house, they probably laugh and eat unbalanced meals... and talk about things that don't have deep symbolic meaning.
They're probably this like normal family.
- Child abuse!
- Well, it's tangled.
Where the hell is it?
Sweetie, I can't do braids in a basement.
- It was right here.
- Fine, I'll do my braids myself.
So this is actually happening?
You're actually going to wallpaper the bedroom?
- Yes, what's the big deal?
- Nothing.
Except this wallpaper sat here through the entire Bush administration.
I just figure since I'm not working, you know, keep me off the streets.
So you feel okay about...
I mean, you've done this before, right?
- Patty, I can wallpaper a room.
- Right, I'm sorry.
This is really great.
I became yearbook photographer because I liked the idea... that I could sort of watch life without having to be a part of It.
But when you are yearbook photographer... you are never In the picture.
I'm yearbook photographer.
This is my job.
Brian, I'd like you to meet Delia.
She's new.
- It's really nice meeting you.
- Yes.
Maybe I'll see you around?
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Nice, Krakow.
Real suave.
- What?
It was pretty obvious what she was thinking.
What?
She likes you.
Ask her to the dance!
Hold on, wait.
This World Happiness thing?
It's not a "thing".
It's a dance.
Which I am trying to make into a great dance.
Which is almost impossible since apparently the idea of school spirit... is out the window.
Wait, so getting back to this Delia thing...
She's working at Big Guy Burger tonight from 3:30 until 8:00.
Did she actually say anything?
Let's just say it was very clearly implied.
I mean, World Happiness!
Who thought of that?
- It sounds like Sharon.
- Definitely Sharon.
- So, are you like going?
- What?
I know, I just thought in this really obvious way it'd be sort of fun.
Angela, if you expect Jordan Catalano to ask you...
- Maybe she just wants to dance.
- Exactly.
Wait, so there's no chance?
Angela, Jordan Catalano doesn't go to school dances.
- As, like, policy.
- Right.
I sort of figured.
So...
I mean, if you wanted to go, which of course you don't... you could let Brian Krakow ask you.
- Rayanne!
- What?
If you don't get Catalano, you've got Brian Krakow to pay.
Then excuse me, I'd be at the dance with Brian Krakow.
- Excuse me?
- Can we help you?
I was just...
Is Miss Chavatal around?
Do you see Miss Chavatal?
Cool vest.
What has always amazed me, Is fishermen.
How they wait there forever... and when something finally tugs on their line, they don't panic.
The strange thing is... even though I've established verbal communication with Della Flsher...
I still think about Angela, constantly.
Why am I like this?
I truly slcken myself.
I just have to stop being her little puppet.
I vow to never again... to show up at Angela's door with some lame excuse.
Hi.
I mean, hello.
I sort of lent this atlas to Angela... which she was technically supposed to return in March.
So...
Well, she isn't here now.
- Could you...
- Right.
Right.
So, putting up wallpaper?
Lower, lower.
Wait.
The morning glories aren't lined up.
In my room, one seam is a little off and I stare at it constantly.
It's like destroying me.
So, you're like what, retired?
I mean, I mean, not retired.
No.
I'm sort of planning what to do next.
I don't want to jump into anything blindly.
I mean, it's like wallpaper.
I mean, there are hundreds of patterns out there, and it's kind of daunting... because you're going to have to live with your decision for a long time.
Let's say you're deciding between two particular patterns... and one of them, you definitely know that you really like... and the other is nice wallpaper and all, but just you're not sure if it's really...
- For you.
- Exactly.
But the really great wallpaper... let's say, is totally out of your price range.
Do you take the other wallpaper, even though you don't, let's say... really desire it that much, or do you wait until... the really great wallpaper is cheaper.
I guess it depends on how badly you need wallpaper.
- I would say pretty badly.
- I guess that says it.
Yes.
I can't believe this.
Apparently Della Flsher smiles at everyone.
She's probably from one of those small towns... friendly and smiles at you for no reason.
I hate that type of town.
Napkins.
Thanks for choosing Big Guy.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Welcome to Big Guy Burger, where every guy is a big guy.
I was just, you know, happened to be in the neighborhood, and so...
So, what can I get for you?
- Just a Hunkburger.
- For here or to go?
I guess to go.
I just, you know, should probably go.
There's something about my life.
It's just automatically true that nothing actually happens.
Not hungry after all?
I was told not to eat red meat by my doctor.
So...
Sorry about being so standard in there.
My manager watches us.
- Right.
- I'm glad you came.
Somewhere far away there was a car alarm.
One of those really annoying ones.
Do you want a sip?
But suddenly, It was the best sound I had ever heard.
So, I guess I should go.
Me, too.
So maybe this is what people mean... when they talk about, you know, life.
So are you going to ask me to this dance, or what?
I was going to, eventually.
So you just haven't gotten around to it?
Exactly.
Look, Kyle.
I am under a ton of pressure here, okay?
The dance committee, student council, yearbook, band.
I don't have time to worry about being alone at the very dance I organized!
Fine.
Would you like to go to the dance with me?
Yes.
And if you screw this up, I will really hate you.
Like forever.
My life is so ridiculous.
I have to ask Della Flsher to the dance.
I have to.
And I'll do It now.
On the count of three.
One.
Two.
Three.
- I got to run.
I'll catch you later.
- Okay.
Speak!
- Hey.
What's going on?
- Not much.
- So.
You going to the dance?
- Doubtful.
You?
I would kind of have to say, at this point, no.
Guidance is so weird.
So she looked at me all concerned... wanting to know if I was going to the school dance... like that wasn't the stupidest question in history.
And so, I broke down and cried.
It was hysterical.
But, I mean, how's it going?
I mean, how're you doing?
Ten days.
No drink, no drugs.
I'm so clean you could eat off me.
- So, you know that girl, Pam Troy?
- The one with the really bad perm?
No, the one with the diamond stud in her nose.
The one with the crop-tops and... she broke down and cried that time in Human Sexuality?
Yes, so?
So I was thinking of asking her to the dance.
Why?
I know you think the dance is really stupid...
- Why don't you ask him?
- Shut up!
Well, isn't that who you really want to go with?
Isn't it?
Yes, in some imaginary universe that exists in my mind, but...
Leave it to me.
Rayanne, if you say one word to him, I'd kill you.
Rayanne!
My.
Are those morning glories not lining up?
They're lining up.
Because if they're even the slightest bit off... that's all you're ever going to notice.
Is that a bubble?
Patty, I tried every conceivable way to get rid of that bubble.
It is there forever, it's part of our lives.
It will outlive us all.
So, I dropped off that brochure I did for the university... with their precious perforations.
While I was there, I picked up a Continuing Education bulletin.
Why did you circle all these cooking classes?
Why do you think?
I mean, isn't that what you always talked about?
Well, this is some kind of adult education workshop.
What I talked about was going full time to a culinary institute.
- Which we can't...
- Which we can't afford.
I know.
But that we can afford, so why are you closing your mind?
- Can we at least think about it?
- Okay.
Great.
- Hi.
- Hey.
So, did you hear that they're going to exterminate...
- Fourth period lunch?
- I didn't hear that.
It's just something people are obsessing about.
It's like sometimes people fill their minds with all these... stupid things, you know?
To keep themselves from thinking about, you know... what's really important.
Like this World Happiness Dance.
I mean, it's so stupid.
What does that even mean, you know?
Like if we dance the world is really going to get happier?
I mean, really, come on.
I don't think so.
There's a dance?
Yes, there's like five hundred posters up around the school about it.
Right.
I guess I kind of mean the idea of the dance is kind of false.
I mean, I doubt I'm even going.
I mean, I'm sure you're obviously not going.
Right?
- See, I have this philosophy.
- You have a philosophy?
If I go somewhere and someone I know is there... then cool, there's something natural about it.
But once you start making plans, then you have like... obligations and that basically blows.
So my feeling is, whatever happens, happens.
I have to say, I really respect that.
I forgot my geometry book in my locker, so...
- Hi.
- Hi.
I've been looking for you all day.
I've been really busy.
I'm carrying a triple minor.
I didn't even know you could have a triple minor.
They sort of bent the rules for me.
So...
Miss Chavatal wants me to catch up with the rest of the unit... since I just transferred here.
I have no idea what I'm even looking at.
Simple.
They're just paramecia.
Can I look?
Finally, an erection from actual physical contact.
What are the little hairy things around the edges?
Those are cilia.
They propel the paramecia.
You're a lifesaver.
So, remember when we were discussing wallpaper?
Okay, lower.
A little bit lower.
It's just so weird when you've chosen your wallpaper... and you think you're pretty happy with it... but every time you pass by the other wallpaper... the one that you sort of like more...
Brian, we're not talking about wallpaper here, are we?
Maybe not.
- Brian Krakow is here.
Good.
- Hi, I was just...
Helping, I know.
Thank you.
So, did you get a chance to look at that bulletin?
Not yet.
I should have mentioned, tomorrow's the last day...
- Of registration.
So...
- That's all right.
I'll do it next time.
Because you know, there are some very important chefs...
- Running some of the these classes.
- Sure, like who?
- Stephan Dieter.
- Who?
You know, that guy from the TV show.
Stephan's Kitchen.
- That guy died.
- He did not die.
Are you sure?
Graham, can I just say, I don't understand.
I thought that you planned to do this.
At this point the way things are now... it just doesn't feel right to make plans.
I'd rather let whatever happens, happen.
- So.
- So.
Have you thought about the dance?
Not much.
Have you?
No.
I mean, it's just that if I'm not going to work Saturday...
I have to, you know, switch with someone right away.
I see.
So, if I'm going to go, I would need to know now.
That's... yes.
- Rayanne's right.
- About what?
- Corey and the dance.
- She told you?
- It's okay, I understand.
- No, you don't understand.
I mean, you don't understand because you don't.
You couldn't...
You're right, Rickie.
I couldn't possibly understand having... an obsession for a person I have zero hope of ever becoming involved with.
We're hopeless.
And so in conclusion, I guess the truth is that I can't, you know... work twenty-four hours a day.
All work and no play, or whatever.
Brian, are you asking me to the dance?
- Yes.
- I thought so.
Angela, maybe we should go.
You know, to that stupid dance.
- Oh, my God, we should go together!
- Right.
Eight o'clock?
Eight o'clock!
I feel so much better, you know?
Just to know that it's settled.
Hey, Rickie.
So, see you Saturday right?
Excuse me?
Rayanne said the three of us are going to hang together.
At the dance?
Did I get that wrong?
No.
I mean, you got it completely right.
Cool.
So, Saturday.
So, I guess I should go with you and Rayanne and Corey, right?
Sure.
I mean, except that, you know, then it might seem like... you and I are together.
Like a boy-girl thing.
- It might?
- Yes, like a double date?
Yes, I guess it might.
Whereas if it's just me and Corey and Rayanne...
Wait a second!
Oh, my God, this is too obvious, isn't it?
I mean, maybe you should come.
No, I shouldn't.
You know, you're right.
I got to go find Rayanne.
Hi.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
It's kind of an emergency.
We were just...
No, it's okay.
I got to go anyway.
So, see you Saturday?
Yes.
- So you asked her to the dance?
- Yes.
In fact, I just wanted to go with someone, so I just thought her.
So I just asked.
It was, you know, that simple.
She seemed pretty much blown away.
That's great.
Look, this is going to sound really weird.
Rayanne's doing this thing for Rickie... because he has an enormous crush on someone... and it's just this very delicate balance.
And I know you're going with Delia, and I'm really happy for you...
And as she continued to basically babble, It started to sink In that... something truly amazing was happening.
I was thinking, that since we're neighbors, it'd be sort of convenient... if there was just some way I could go along...
When you stripped away all the blathering...
Angela Chase was asking to go to the dance with me.
I mean, just to get me there.
Not that we'd actually be going together.
Of course.
No.
I mean, not to go go, because you're going with Delia.
I just need a technical way to get there.
It's not a problem.
- I mean, fine.
Tag along.
- Thanks.
Can he excuse us?
- How could you do that?
- What did I do?
What did you do?
You invited Corey to the dance with you and me...
- When I specifically told you not to.
- Oh, that.
He painted your shoes.
- You want me to ask him to do yours?
- Rayanne!
Listen to me.
This isn't funny.
Now you've driven me crazy in the past, but I'm willing to overlook it... because the truth is, I want to go to the dance.
But if you say one word to embarrass me while the three of us are together...
- What?
- I won't be there.
What?
I just don't think I'm ready to go to an event like that.
I talked to the counselor, and she said she doesn't think I'd be able to.
Who cares about your stupid drinking problem?
This is my life!
- Don't worry, it's no problem.
- Yes, it is.
I will call Corey.
I will explain the whole thing.
It'll be fine.
Hi.
Did you want to talk to me?
Yes.
How are you?
Brian.
We only have a minute so...
Right.
So, it's sort of about the dance.
It turns out that I kind of forgot... about this other commitment that I already had.
It's kind of, you know, special or whatever, so I...
Of all the stupid things I've said, which are countless...
I've never wanted to take something back more than that one.
Maybe we can go catch a movie or whatever.
This other commitment, is it another girl or something?
Brian, look.
It doesn't matter who you told first.
You know, if it was her or it was me.
You should go with who you want to go with.
Just be honest with me, please?
Okay.
- So, I guess I would.
- You would what?
Rather go.
You know, with her.
I'm really sorry.
It would be really good if you would leave.
- Delia...
- Please?
I know this is weird, but just take a look at this?
So what does this mean?
So you enrolled me?
Yes.
I mean, I know that you've had your hands full... with the wallpaper and everything.
Graham, I just have this feeling like you're really going to enjoy this.
You signed me up...
Yes.
I know that sometimes it's hard for you to...
- What?
- Focus.
Graham, look.
I just thought...
I mean, I know you like to cook...
It's not that I like to cook.
It's this thing I can just do.
The one thing I can do.
- That's just the point, sweetheart...
- I'll get it!
Honey, I mean... ask who it is first.
- Who is it?
- Brlan Krakow.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
We're going to that dance thing.
I mean, we're actually not going with each other.
Oh, my God.
You know, when I want to, I can focus just fine.
So, we're picking Delia up?
Wait a second.
Your father is picking the three of you up... after the dance, right?
- As it turns out, Delia can't go.
- Wait a second.
Why?
It's her aunt actually.
She's actually in the hospital.
I hope it isn't anything too serious.
Graham?
I'm sorry, okay?
Graham?
Oh, my God.
This room looks amazing.
I guess we found another thing you can do.
You're welcome.
My God.
Did you see her face... when he told her that that other girl wasn't coming?
They're going to have such a terrible time.
Look...
I know you probably feel like you can't breathe sometimes... like I'm this horrible nag, or something.
Feel free to stop me any time.
Look, I'll put a stop on the check.
I'll call the registrar and just tell them...
Don't do that.
I sort of have to see if Stephan Dieter can still stiffen his egg whites.
I mean, since I'm already signed up.
I mean, thank you for signing me up.
So finally the mouse starts running across the classroom... and I swear to God, it starts chasing Mrs. Schindleheim... which is when she tripped over Nicholas Cayhill, which is why... she's wearing that neck brace.
You're really funny.
So, where's Rayanne?
- She didn't call you?
- No, why?
Well, she told me she was going to call you... because she's not coming.
Why?
It's kind of a long story.
- So she's not coming at all?
- No, sorry.
You don't have to be sorry.
I wanted to ask her how she liked her sneakers.
Well, Rayanne is very changeable.
It's just weird, you know... when you have a picture of how something is going to be... and it turns out completely different.
Yeah.
It is weird.
- Lot of people.
- Yes.
Okay, this is the simplest thing in the world.
People do It every day.
Just start a conversation.
Yes.
So, do you think you can get me something to drink?
- Okay.
What do you want?
- Just, you know, whatever.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.
So, you and Angela come together?
Sort of.
So I was thinking of hanging with you guys, but I didn't know... if you were here as friends, or as an actual thing, but... you know, it's whatever is better for you.
Whatever.
I mean, maybe you shouldn't come over.
We might want to dance or something.
That's really great.
- It's punch.
- Thanks.
- What did Rickie want?
- Nothing.
What did you say to him?
Nothing.
I just said it was better that maybe he didn't hang out with us.
- What?
- I thought that it might be awkward.
Rickie is my friend.
He's my friend, too.
It's just...
what if we...
I don't know...
If we wanted privacy or something?
- Why would we want privacy?
- We probably wouldn't, but...
Brian, what do you think is happening here?
What?
Nothing?
Didn't I explain what the whole reasoning for this was?
I just thought if we wanted to dance or something.
Why would...
we're not going to dance.
I realize that.
Look, it wasn't some big plan or anything.
I don't even believe in making plans.
Whatever happens, happens.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.
What did you say to Delia?
What do you mean?
You don't understand people, Krakow.
You're so heartless.
I mean, the fact that she called me heartless... that's just really good.
That's excellent.
How ironic can you get without puking?
I was really wrong.
I realize that now... that what I did was pretty heartless or whatever.
I am so glad you made it.
You know Kyle, right?
Yes.
Hi.
You know what, I am glad you decided to come on your own.
It's better.
There are so many really cute guys I want you to meet!
Okay?
So, Rayanne never called Corey.
Would you like me to kill her?
That's a really nice offer, but the truth is... that would only solve half the problem.
What's the other half?
The other half is, like, you know, the tough half.
Which is?
Which is like just, you know... that I belong nowhere, with no one.
That I don't fit.
I'm starving, man.
What do you think?
- Yes, let's go get something to eat.
- I've got to pick up Kimmy, too.
- She's getting out of work.
- Hey, Catalano, let's go, man.
We're going to Kathy's first, right?
There's a killer place I want to check out, too, later.
Yes, in a minute.
It's okay.
Go.
Hey.
- Why are you like this?
- Like what?
- Like how you are?
- Hey, Jordan, you coming or not?
How am I?
How am I?
I'll be right back.
Okay?
Yes.
Hi.
Brian, this was all my fault.
Her hair smelled Incredlble.
I mean, I ruined your night and Delia's night.
I should have stayed out of it.
Her hair smelled like this orange grove we passed when I was eight... on the way to see my grandmother.
And I can't really explain why I even got involved.
But I'm sorry.
But I guess that Is just her shampoo.
Or whatever.
These things are so stupid.
I know.
No one ever has a good time.
So, I don't know, you want to dance or something?
Not with you.
Well, I'm just...
I just...
I don't care about dancing that much.
Me either.
This is MediaBreak.
Give us three minutes and we'll give you the world!
Good evening.
I'm Bo Harlan with Rocky Crenshaw, and these are today's top stories:
Good news for the environment.
In Detroit today the first
BS-5000 rolled off the assembly line.
Rocky, it's a methane powered car that actually runs on manure.
Oh, there's certainly lots of that around, Bo.
On a more serious note.
Another homeless man has disappeared from our city streets, the twelfth in less than a month.
Please report known new clues and fear that a serial killer, some call 'the Dogtown Ripper', may be stalking Old Detroit homeless.
Good news for Delta City today.
Omni-Consumer Products announced plans to use cutting edge technology in a far reaching project that will automate
Delta City's utilities in public transportation infrastructure.
I have great hopes for Metronet, a supercomputer that will power this city into a future, that not only has the silver lining but will work better and cost less.
But can it program your VCR?
We'll be right back.
They're flagellant or senile, and the best years of their lives are pretty much behind.
If you're over sixty, should you still be allowed to vote?
Tune in tomorrow and we'll see "What's on Your Mind" with me, Umberto Ortega.
This just in.
A terrorist is taking hostages at a retirement home in Old Detroit.
We take you now to the scene live with MediaBreak correspondent Charles Coffey.
- Charles?
- Yes, Rockee, I'm here, at Convalescence Services.
And it's not a pretty picture.
One officer dead, one wounded, and inside
- William Ray 'Pudface' Morgan, a violent psychopath who recently escaped from the Henry Ford center for the morally challenged.
He's currently holding a group of helpless retired people hostage.
Don't jerk me around, cops!
Do what I tell you, or I'll get mad and do something really ugly!
You know there's no escape, Morgan!
You know we don't negotiate with terrorists!
Sergeant, he's up there with a military hardware, he's got the whole place barricaded.
Yeah, there are two or three of his gang in there that who would just love us to try a frontal assault.
Tell us, Sergeant, just exactly what it is Mr. Morgan wants?
You know, I wish it was that simple.
See, when he was arrested five years ago by Robocop, he suffered severe damage to his face in a toxic accident of his own making.
So what you're saying is, he wants revenge?
- No, he wants Robocop!
- Listen up!
You've got one minute to send me the robot, or I'll blow all this thing and send them to kingdom come!
- Any comments, Sergeant?
Officer?
- Get outta here.
- All right, here's the situation...
- You called me...
It's bad.
Go get them, Murphy.
'Pudface' Morgan?
Hey, robot.
You wanted to talk to me?
Nah...
I wanna kill ya.
Hands above your head.
You are under arrest.
No, you're too late for that, robot.
Take a good look at this face.
You did this to me.
Every time I sneeze I think of you.
And I don't wanna ever think of you again!
Now what, tin man?
Police brutality?
In front of all these prune sacs?
You're deadly, you metal giant...
Aaaah...!
Nice job back there, Murphy.
Thank you, Madigan.
Oh, I took my exam for detective this morning.
I don't know for sure but I think I aced it.
The force can always use another good detective.
Thank you.
Messy, lazy, sentimental, irrational, supersticious, compassionate.
The main obstacle to running the world properly has always been the human element.
Pardon me?
- You're right about that, doc.
- Yes, I tried, I tried to convince those fools at MIT futurological congress.
Of course they had no vision.
They threw ethics at me.
- Well, I should hope so.
- Well, that'll never happen here at OCP, doc.
This isn't academia.
It's corporate culture, baby.
We've got the money, we've got the gas, we've got the guts.
After you.
Yes, now the real work can begin, which, of course, means obliterating everything spontaneous.
NeuroBrain will reduce all decisions to an unimpeachable binary utopia:
yes-no, black-white, on-off, yes-no, black-white...
In short, utter perfection.
- What about the human spirit?
- The human spirit?
Ha-ha.
My dear chaos behind the other name.
- Miss Powers, that will be all.
- No-no-no,
I would very much like to hear what your secretary thinks of my philosophy.
Is there something you don't understand?
This utopia of yours sounds close to something a dictator like Hitler would come up with.
- And I don't think I would really like that.
- How dare you compare me to Hitler...
Don't pay attention to her, doc, she's just a secretary.
I am a vice-president, I pay to have opinions and I think you're brilliant.
Yes, Hitler was an amateur.
As you know,
OCP is hosting an upcoming shareware expo.
We never share anything but it's our chance to sniff out the competition.
Chip?
Copernicus.
Newton.
Einstein.
Disney.
Geniuses with the credentials to change the world.
Cybersafe Concepts has found just such brilliants in the man it is now my pleasure to introduce to you.
My fellow executives, doctor Cray Mallardo.
Oh, Chip...
When my new cybernetic interface, NeuroBrain, goes online, life as we know it will be over.
Where once a city employed and was victim to the whims of ten thousand civil servants.
NeuroBrain can never go on strike, will not call in sick and does not need a coffee break every 3.25 hours...
Imagine a city... where transportation systems, like corpuscles in the blood stream, move freely with purpose and at speed;
where utilities are dispersed from one central point, digestive system directing nutrients to hungry organs:
schools and hospitals.
A law enforcement that efficiently identifies and apprehends criminals like antibodies attacking the virus.
It is a bold, new world, ladies and gentlemen;
and, if I have anything to say about it, one that we will be visiting very soon.
What's the earliest possible time for him to having Metronet online?
NeuroBrain portfolio, please...
Oh, no, no!
- I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!
- No-no-no, don't touch me.
Don't ever touch me.
No touching, no touching.
That's it, Powers, you're fired.
- Get out!
- Nonsense, Chip.
Accidents happen.
Now, when do you expect to be online?
Well, sir, we're pretty much ready to go right now, it's just we have some little bugs tying down.
Excellent.
When CamSoft, Mega,
Extel and all others show at shareware expo,
I want to stand at this window and see my city run by NeuroBrain.
They'll eat their hearts out.
Get out of my way!
Move it!
Look out!
Emergency!
Out of the way!
Watch your feet!
What are you doing back in my station again?
You've got to lock me up, sergeant Parks.
I've been a material witness.
I saw some bank robbers, five or six of them,
- if you don't give me protection they'll...
- No way.
You know what?
You're going back to Family services.
You've gotta believe me!
Please don't make me go back!
I hate that place.
Please let me stay.
I'll be good.
You'll be good...
you're telling lies, you run away...
You know what you need?
What you need is a good spanking.
- Come here!
- Help!
Child abuse!
Help!
You're okay?
Yes!
Test results are in.
Upper 10%, thank you very much.
I knew I aced it.
You think I'll make a good detective?
You figured out who I was.
I heard you trashed another car.
Any other little problems I should know about?
All systems are functional.
Good. 'Cause every time you break something I get blamed for it.
Try not to do it with... this.
Check it out.
Wow.
That's a... piece to roll on.
Yeah, it's one of the new interceptors.
0 to 60 in 4.2 seconds, top speed 200+, heads-up display, maps, a satellite uplink, and a lot of other goodies that cost more than I make any year.
Well, let us take it for a ride, shall we?
Hide me!
They come to take me away...
Wow, Robocop!
You're my hero.
When I grow up, I gonna be just like you.
When I grow up, I gonna be just like you, Dad.
- Hey-hey, no kids allowed.
- It's okay, that's okay, ease up, Charlie.
No one's going to hurt you, what's your name, little one?
Gadget.
She's a runaway from Family services and she's going back there right now.
This is a police station, not an orphanage.
No, no, I don't wanna go back there, no!
Please don't take me...
You were thinking about them again, weren't you?
Images are all that's left of what I was.
I want to remember.
Murphy, why don't you just tell Nancy and Jimmy who you are?
No.
It's better that they think I am dead.
No, no, no!
No-no, tell the others I want main trunk brought in under the floor here.
All right doc, I don't care what it takes just as long as NeuroBrain is online in time for the shareware expo.
A-ah...
We still have a problem.
Oh, not again.
Jeez, what's it been so far, doc?
Twelve?
Trying is the only way to eliminate ever, you know?
You know me...
I'll do anything to get ahead but isn't this getting a bit ridiculous?
Nonsense, Chip.
The interface between a decision-making complexity of a human mind and a computing power of artificial intelligence is a delicate matter.
Now, you know what I need.
And the sooner I'll get it the sooner you'll meet your deadline, alright?
Just do it.
Hey!
Hey!
Cut it out!
- Hey, we're not gonna hurt you...
- We're just gonna kill you!
You can't keep running forever, old man!
That's it!
Come on, get him, boys!
Please...
I ain't done nothing.
I was just minding my own business.
You've got no right...
It's people like you that make people like us mad, you got it?
It's people like us that keep people like you in line, you got that?
I ain't got nothing but the clothes on my back.
What do you just want from me?
It's obvious that you have never used your brain to your fullest advantage.
Hold him, boys...
Let him go, he's not going far.
He's looking pretty stiff.
Now, cut it out, that's not funny!
He's not dead yet.
And it's no good for OCP if he's damaged at all.
Now get him in the trunk!
Hug the children, hold them close to you,
hug the children, make a dream come true...
When it's cold and dark and no one cares, there's still a place where shelter is provided, no matter what your race, creed, color or gender.
Please support the Rainbow playroom.
And remember to hug the children.
Has the Dogtown Ripper claimed another victim?
Police fear that a disappearance of Henry Aaron Wincler will end up as yet another unsolved murder.
Many believe it to be the work of an elusive serial killer.
At city hall, mayor Friendly had this to say:
Police investigators have assured me that these rumors of a serial killer are utterly unfounded.
No bodies have been found, no witnesses have come forward.
And I really think we should consider the fringe lifestyles of the indigenes involved as a possible source of the problem.
Come on, Sarge, I saw old Hank playing chess just every day for five years on that corner.
I know it too, Madigan, what do you want from me?
He has been missing for 24 hours homicide hasn't even assigned anybody to the case!
Now his friends said the last time they saw him he was headed for the shelter, right?
And to get there, he's got a cut to the old tire plant...
Look, when you make a detective is gonna be a sorry-day for the criminal element in Detroit, but until then there's that little thing called departmental protocol.
Come on, Sarge, if the victim was some butthead VIP at OCP the whole department would be on this case, but no!
Since old Hank doesn't pay property taxes, nobody cares!
- Are you getting personally involved in this?
- All I know is somebody's gotta give a damn, Sarge!
I saw him!
I saw him, I saw him!
I know who've done it!
What?
What did you see?
The Dogtown Ripper.
I saw him get some guy.
He was wearing a suit and he had a sharp thing like the doctor uses.
- Is that so?
- Yeah, and he had some accomplishments with him.
- You mean accomplices?
- Yeah, that too.
You know what?
You're very good little witness, I'm impressed.
I've got some mug shots.
I want you to take a look and tell me if you recognize anybody.
Male, female?
- Now look real close...
- Hey, let me go!
Give me your hand.
You're not gonna run away again, I'll tell you that.
Put your finger... the other one...
You ought to be ashamed of yourself lying about other people's bad luck.
- But I'm not lying!
- Yeah, alright...
All right, which one of you guys is gonna take her back to Family Services?
Hey, Robocop.
- I've got a job for you.
- Trouble?
If she stays on a street, yeah, she's headed for real trouble.
Take her back to Family Services, will you?
She's a compulsive liar and rebel.
I don't wanna go back there.
No one's gonna ever adopt me.
Let's go, little one.
Feeling better, Chayken?
Sorry about the mess, doc, it's just a... when his eyes started staring up at you like that... then the bonesaw...
I've told you many times it is essential for the NeuroBrain interface that the subject be alive when the brain is removed.
- You see, as I...
- Please doc, don't...
How did it go?
Well, the transplanting to the neuro receptacle was flawless, but that has never been the problem.
Get rid of the husk.
Body's in the trunk.
Take it to the toxic waste disposal center and oxidize it like you did the others.
You know, usually we hate people like you.
But you kill people we hate... hate real good.
Thank you.
That's what I like most about business:
money makes friends out of almost anybody.
Hug the children, hold them close to you,
hug the children...
Why won't anybody believe me?
- Because you lied.
- But I'm not lying now.
It was the Dogtown Ripper, and I saw what he did to that poor old man.
poor old man
Tell me what you saw.
Some Dogtown boys held the old man so he could give him a shot.
He looked dead, but he wasn't.
His eyes were still alive.
What did the Ripper look like?
He was tall, but not too tall.
He had brown hair
- and he was wearing a suit.
- Did he say anything?
He said he needed the old man's brain.
- Why?
- I don't know, something for the OCP...
- Do you believe me?
- Yes.
A good citizen always tells the truth, right?
Right.
But what if somebody acts like a good citizen but lies anyways?
That's the worst kind of liar.
Come on, I want to show you something.
Hug the children, make a dream come true...
Now listen to me, you useless little brat.
Act cute.
I don't care if the building falls down around you, you're going to act cute.
You know what happens to troublemakers.
I send them to live with Dogtown boys...
All right, that's it.
Roll camera, are we rolling, Ed, we'd better be rolling.
- God, yes!
- ... hold the tap closer.
That spontaneous expression!
It's better than anything you get from these brats when you ask them to act.
Jeez...
All right, that's it.
Okay, so now we cut that face with bowls of food and crowdshots from Bangladesh - and we got a new intro for the show.
Okay, people, that's a wrap.
Miss Lamour, there's a woman here, a parent with a lost child.
I tried to tell her...
Oh, I do not have time for another modeling display of parental loss...
Okay, let's make it quick.
This is where Fanny Lamour tells the biggest lies that ever were.
My dear, I feel your pain.
I'm worried about my son Jimmy.
I yelled at him about his grades, and he ran away.
I thought maybe he came here...
Till death do us part
I brought a video that I made last Christmas.
He's a good boy.
But we lost his father a while ago.
And it's been hard to raise him by myself.
I really have to tell you something:
I love you very much
Come on, Jimmy, how about a smile?
What's there to smile about?
This is for you, Dad
I know every child here and I'm sorry to say he's not with us.
Edward, please, take down this poor woman's information in case her child does show up here.
- Phone call, miss Lamour.
- If you'll excuse me,
I really must go and be with the children, it's story time.
- What's the matter?
- I have to go.
Somewhere there is a crime happening.
Hey, baby.
How are your hormons?
Stop it, Chip, I'm not in the mood.
I just had a mother in here whose son was one of those brats your Dogtown associates recruited.
Our arrangement is starting to make me really nervous.
Hey, what's the worry?
You got kids that are too old to be adopted, and I need kids that can get their hands dirty instead of me.
It's win-win, babycake.
Family Services must never be associated with the Dogtown boys.
- What if he talks...
- Oh, who's gonna believe a Dogtown boy?
And you know how it is in those gangs:
either you're in, or you're kibbled.
You know what I mean?
Well, I'll leave the testosteron management up to you, Chip.
That's the ticket, baby.
So, how about it:
my place, tomorrow, sexercise...
Beg for it.
Who-ho-ho...
Kissy lovey-dovey, sugar sweetie, honey pumpkin pie.
I'll be there at noon.
When I grow up, I'm gonna be just like you, Dad
Murphy, why don't you just tell Nancy and Jimmy who you are
He's a good boy.
But we lost his father a while ago
He signed the release forms when he joined the force.
Legally he's dead.
We can pretty much do what we want
He's a machine, he doesn't have a memory, he has a program
"Hate everyone, you're always right while everyone else is always wrong, join the Dog...", huh, "People like us...
Uplink 99-05606.

The cerebral cortex can both process information and learn from its mistakes, but the computer is quicker and more reliable than the human brain, so, what I have is the best of the both worlds:
a brain married to a computer.
- It's beautiful.
- Yes.
Yes, yes!
NeuroBrain is a living machine, a flux is its life course.
This means, we're gonna be online in time for the shareware expo?
I can't wait to see my bonus.
Doc, you're gonna be able to write your own ticket.
A chair at MIT, Science Department at the White House!
Small potatoes, Chayken.
The city of tomorrow will be modelled after Delta City, ergo the man who controls Delta city controls the future.
And with NeuroBrain at my command I can do anything!
I can even make you the number one at OCP.
Yes, I could, and I will...
No, no, no-no-no-no-no...
I thought you said this one was intelligent!
Hey, he was a chess player, you've gotta be smart to do that!
What do you think went wrong, doc?
Well, there's only one explanation in there!
A bad brain, a brain damaged by stress and human abuse, it couldn't bare the load, could it?
Well, if you don't get this thing working by shareware, we're the ones who're gonna be damaged by stress and human abuse!
What I need is a young brain, a fresh brain, a brain not yet corrupted by life.
Excuse me, Mr. Chayken, but I found something significant in the Himble digital play... suit.
They actually stole our program and rewrote it to make it look like it was their idea.
I'm sorry to interrupt doctor Mallardo but I found Mr. Chayken will want to know.
That's all right, eh, that's just a...
that's quite a...
Could you excuse us, just a moment, please?
Have a look around.
Good work, Miss Powers.
You just earned yourself a bonus.
All right, listen up.
Everybody who listens to the message gets peanut butter and a jelly sandwich, and white bread, of course...
- Eat up, Murphy.
- What, you ain't hungry?
- Smells like something died in here.
- I don't smell nothing.
Except maybe some new dog meat.
Bare your throats to the biggest dog of all.
Somebody broke the square!
Who broke the square, Big Dog?
Dork parents and their idiot politicians.
They said there was enough to go around.
They let the foreigners in.
They squander your future to poor people and bums.
They sure changed you... man, they stole your freedom...
Those days are over!
Corporate America has finally answered to the wake up call and joined us.
And we'll fight for better tomorrow.
With their help, we've already begun to clean up the homeless vermin that pollute old Detroit.
So, who will join us?
Who wants to make the square whole?
Make the square whole!
Make the square whole!
Make the square whole!
Make the square whole!
- Where are you going, little dog?
- I heard your message.
Your message sucks!
I'm outta here.
You're not one of us.
You're kibbled.
Boys that don't play nice don't get to play at all.
Drop the bats!
Freeze!
Stop it!
Don't do it!
Freeze!
Hank...
Cause of death?
Well, at hand I'd have to say he died because somebody removed his brain.
- What, some kind of a satanic ritual or something?
- No-no-no.
It's not an usual "axe-him-up-hack-him-up" psycho torch murder.
This is a work of a doctor.
- A doctor?
- It had to be.
His blood show traces of tubocurarini chloride.
It's a neurological agent, used to paralyze patients so they don't go flipping around during delicate surgical procedures.
Right, right, that's what the lab said was in this.
I found it where Hank was last seen.
He looked dead, but he wasn't.
His eyes were still alive
What's he doing?
The last image the deceased saw is after preserved in the back of the retina.
Wait a sec, you mean we might be able to ID old Hank's murderer?
Unless his eyes looked someplace else.
Then you've got nothing.
- It's not clear.
- What I tell you...
But it can be enhanced.
Great.
I'll have OCP forensics check of the shipping crate.
Excuse me.
I can't keep this up much longer.
No, we've only been aerobic for eight minutes.
- Don't wimp out on me now!
- Come on, baby.
- I'm beat.
- Just do it!
- Hello, who is it?
- Who do you think you're...
Doc, calm down, I can't understand anything you're saying!
- ...a catastrophe...
- That's right, just take a deep breath, attaboy.
Okay, now what is the matter?
You are a stupid worthless imbecile.
You said you take care of everything?
Well, guess what:
Robocop's on the case!
Robocop?
Doc, this isn't going to be a problem,
I know a perfect man to take care of Robocop.
This is highly unusual, Mr. Chayken.
What's the problem, Warden?
This transfer has been approved by OCP, do you want me to get your boss on the phone?
Oh, no-no-no, that won't be necessary.
But just out of curiosity, what exactly is the CyberSafe Concepts planning to do with Delta City's most dangerous criminal?
Have you ever heard of doctor Cray Mallardo, the brilliant cyberneticist?
Dr. Mallardo has taken a personal interest in applying of disturbed psychopaths, like this poor fellow.
Perhaps with time, study and a modicum of human kindness,
Mr. Morgan might one day be able to make a meaningful contribution to the community.
Would you like that, Mr. Morgan?
All I ever wanted was a chance to be good.
To a better understanding of the criminal mind.
I always get bubbles up my nose, he-he-he...
Let's cut to the chase.
Now, you wouldn't get me out of there if you didn't want something.
How right you are.
And what I want is to give you an opportunity to go down in history... as the man who killed Robocop.
40 millimeter, armor-piercing
Cobra assault cannon.
- Nice.
- Stare at the art, Pudface.
May I call you Pudface?
Sure thing, poodle boy.
Wait a sec.
Did I hear you right, partner?
Cray Mallardo, the scientist?
- He's OCP, you be careful.
- According to the retinal scan, he was the last person to see the victim alive.
I'm on my way.
Excellent.
Dr. Cray Mallardo, you're under arrest.
I don't...
I don't understand, what are the charges?
- The suspicion of murder.
- Murder?
Murder, that's ludicrous!
I'm a scientist, my work benefits all mankind.
You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in accord of law.
Oh...
Aaah, no!
No please, don't beat me again, aaah!
No, it hurts!
Excuse me, officer,
I'd like to report a crime in progress.
- Where?
- About right where you're standing.
See you in hell, Robocop!
Nice shooting, Puddles!
Officer down!
What took you so long, you don't know what I've been through.
Come on, doc!
- Drive!
- Hang on!
It's time for
Commander Cash!
Weapon crime, moral decay, the city's going to heck!
But what can we do?
You can come with me!
Commander Cash!
Fight crime with our strong economy... and these!
Credit cards!
Be a superhero!
Be a supershopper!
The OCP supercard!
No annual membership fee and still at the low low 38% annual interest rate!
The people of Detroit lost a hero yesterday when Robocop was destroyed in a criminal ambush by escaped psychopath William Ray 'Pudface' Morgan.
But today Robocop's illustrious crime-fighting reputation was tarnished by allegations of police misconduct.
No, I don't know what he wanted but he was out of control as it's abundantly clear from the videotape that I turned over to the authorities.
MediaBreak has obtained the copy of this tape.
We want to warn the more sensitive viewers they may find the following images disturbing.
At Public Works, Chip Chayken, vice-president, "Cybersafe Concepts", had this to say:
We here at OCP would like everybody to try to remember the good things about Robocop and not let this truly unfortunate final episode tarnish what otherwise has been
a sterling career.
Rest in peace, Robocop.
No, Murphy...
Charlie.
- Just a second...
Yeah?
- He's...
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.
The way the suits are talking, it might as well be.
Now he's able to preserve his organics but it will cost a fortune to bring him back online.
According to the guy on the right,
OCP's not paying.
Lippencot!
What do you mean, OCP's not paying for this?
This man did more to fight crime in the city than any other police officer in its history.
- Who are you?
- Officer Lisa Madigan.
He was my friend and my partner.
Well, that says a lot about the pathetic side of your social life.
You see, that is not a man.
That is a machine.
And the machine belongs to OCP.
Now, why don't you be a good cop and go and busy yourself with some sort of police work?
I have reasons to believe that doctor Cray Mallardo, the man Robocop had under arrest, may be involved in several homicides.
Now, what do you think about that?
That is absurd.
Doctor Mallardo is a scientist of unimpeachable integrity.
I know him personally.
Oh, then maybe you can explain why the body in the morgue with no brain has a latent image of Mallardo on its retina?
Body?
I don't know anything about bodies.
I'm an executive.
This is just another example of the police trying to blame the victim.
We'll see about that.
I can't believe you let the cops find that old bum's body.
Hey, it was a glitch.
But it's been handled, for sure this time.
The body and the eyeball are toast.
I'm sure that all of us gathered here today have experienced their share of gridlock.
In a workplace, on the highways, even in our own homes.
But today represents an end to all that.
A brave new world where things work the way they were meant to.
And the service of their creators.
Without further ado, Metronet.
Lights, please...
An entire city under the control of a single powerful computer,
NeuroBrain.
Unbelievable.
To the future!
There he goes, look at him.
Doing what he does best:
taking credit for other people's work!
The idiot, his lack of vision is appalling, even he believes that NeuroBrain was built to run traffic lights.
Well, let him have his little day in the sun.
It will be his last.
- Oh my God!
- What?
What?
What's the matter?
I...
I saw my secretary.
My former secretary,
- I saw her face in there!
- Chip, Chip, Chip, come here.
Chip, come here, come on.
Come on, Chip.
Listen to me, Chip.
Men who seek to change the world cannot afford the luxury of the guilty conscience.
It's all in your mind, Chip.
It's all in your mind, yes.
Now...
Now it's time to show the OCP chairman who has the whip hand...
Well, the show's over at OCP.
Now, it's time for dinner, little drinkies and shop talk, maybe even a little hanky-fanky in a hot tub with miss Walkenhomper from the home office.
This Metronet thing looks big.
We've got a prototype in works but, frankly, we can't crack the hardware.
It's hard to believe the second-rater like Mallardo pulled it off.
I don't think I've ever met a more pompous guy, what's his problem?
He's got his head stuck far in where the sun doesn't shine.
If you know what I mean.
Ooh, that remark will cost you.
Wow.
They don't teach you that at the Harward business school.
Murderers!
Did you hear that?
Now you have me imagining things.
Old Hank is ashes and so is the evidence.
Case is fried, Murphy.
Sure could use your help right about now.
Oh, come in, Dr. Mallardo.
I wanted to thank you personally, that was quite a demonstration you put on last night.
Yes, well, it was entirely for your benefit.
My Metronet is a glowing success.
I was referring to the mishap with the elevator.
The elevator?
You had something to do with that?
Yes, yes, I had everything to do with it, old man... everything in the world.
You see,
I control NeuroBrain,
NeuroBrain controls your Metronet, and Metronet controls, well, everything.
Including the elevators.
You catch my drift.
- You're not implying...
- Yes, I am, I am...
I am implying.
From this moment forward, I control the destiny of Delta City.
You have 36 hours to drop the necessary papers
- and make our new arrangement legal.
- Never.
I will never allow you or anyone else to usurp the authority I have worked so hard to maintain.
Oh... um... gee...
Oh, there's one thing.
You should take the stairs on your way out tonight or that just might be your final answer.
Mallardo's computer has invaded every system at OCP.
He's locked us out of all our files and he's got fiscal control of the entire company.
What kind of options do we have?
I wish I could tell you.
If we bring in the cops, the SCC will demand full disclosure.
Oh, terrific.
That means I'd have to face the stockholders.
I hope you gentlemen are enjoying the day one of my little siege.
I know I am.
And if you don't comply with my demands tomorrow will be much, much worse.
There must be some way to stop him!
Oh, gee...
For God's sake, don't use the... elevator...
Now, let's see how OCP does without its executive staff.
Not this time you don't.
Who are you?
When you murder someone, the least you could do is remember their name.
It's fantastic.
Your brain is in there and you, if you could still be called you, I don't know if you had... well, it doesn't matter, doesn't matter, you are busy performing thousands of tasks simultaneously, all over the city.
- Like what kind of tasks?
- Well, running the subways, the hospitals, water treatment plants, the electric company, airports, you name it;
you're running it!
- I'm running the entire city?
- Uh-huh.
Yes, I knew I was executive material.
Okay, if my brain is in there,
- where is the rest of me?
- Ah... yes.
Well, um... you see, with your brain gone, the rest of your body was quite useless and it was... it was disposed of.
- Disposed of?
- Disposed of, yes.
That was a perfectly good body.
No wrinkles, no stretch marks, very little cellulite.
Do you know how I starved myself?
I haven't even had a dessert in a year.
When I get out of here, I'm gonna kill you!
Well, fortunately for me, you can't get out of there.
I mean not alive, anyway.
Then I'll crash the city board and take me with it.
Just think about what you'd be doing.
It would be all the traffic accidents, deluding, the chaos, not to mention all those poor little sick babies on life support systems in hospitals all over the city.
- Babies?
- Little-little babies.
What are you trying to pull?
Well, check your memory banks.
You're right.
There're currently 35 infants in critical condition in 16 metropolitan city hospitals.
And they're all dependent on you.
I'm not going to listen to you anymore.
I didn't ask for this kind of responsibility.
You poor, poor baby.
You have more power than any woman who has ever lived and you want to go back to be somebody's secretary.
You don't deserve your fate.
Sarge.
I've got to talk to you, something weird is going on in the Ripper case.
What, are you looking for trouble?
You were ordered to stay out of that.
Sarge, just hear me out, okay?
Robo told me he had evidence linking Dr. Cray Mallardo to the Dogtown murders, and the other day I run into this VIP creep named Chayken who got real nervous when I asked him about the VIP doctor.
- Well, I guess that explains this, huh?
- What's this?
Looks like you ruffled a few feathers at OCP.
Traffic?
Come on, Sarge, what is this?
I just aced the test for detective.
Yeah, but you flunked the departmental politics protocol, Madigan.
Rule number one: never ever let the brass know you're smarter than they are.
Crock.
Metro South.
Sergeant Parks?
I want to report a crime.
This would better not be who I think it is.
Fanny Lamour says she's taking care of kids.
But she's really sending them off to Dogtown.
She's a liar in a first degree.
- Tastes one I know, huh, kid?
- I'm not a liar anymore.
I'm a good citizen now, honest.
Hey you!
Get away from the phone!
I wish I could help you, little one.
Get in there with the other children and watch TV like you're supposed to!
...it's so good 4 out of 5 doctors of the Omnimediplex recommend it to stop diarrhoea.
- Try "No-Go".
- They're lean, they're mean, and they're your marines.
Marines posing nude for charity.
The Corps says no, but what do you think?
And if naked sweaty marines aren't your thing, then phone in and tell me what's on your mind.
I am so sorry to bust in like this, I'm officer Lisa Madigan,
- I'm a friend of Robocop's.
- Where are you coming?
Wait, wait, the police are always welcome at Omni-Consumer Products.
- What can I do for you, officer?
- Robocop has evidence that will incriminate Dr. Cray Mallardo and the Dogtowners, you've got to put him back online or our killer goes free.
Can a felon run a publicly held company?
No sir, that would be against the law.
- Sir, what are you doing?
- OCP will assist the Detroit police department in their investigation of Dr. Mallardo.
But to ensure the safety of all OCP employees,
I think it prudent to allow Mallardo to think he has won.
Doc!
We've got big trouble!
Listen, this is important,
Robocop is being put back online!
I need you to help me think about how to... him.
I said shut up!
Get in the car.
I don't think it can wait, it's important...
I don't think she will be able to hear us in here.
- Who?
- Your ex-secretary, that's who.
Diana Powers?
She's dead!
Not exactly...
And so, there you are, my friend.
The frontiers of science are full of surprises.
What we have here is a new form of intelligence, a completely unique melding of human and machine, it's... it's a miracle.
I say we kill it.
Yes, well, of course, but carefully.
The trick is to exterminate the ghost without harming the delicate NeuroBrain interface.
How you're gonna do that?
Darn it!
I don't know, the miller board shot,
I've got to treat its old pulmonary filters, and replacements aren't here yet, on account that they gotta come from a company in Japan, and...
- well, there's a frame damage...
- Can you do it?
Well, I guess with some luck... yes sir, I believe we can.
Then get to it.
You heard what the man said.
Let's go.
Let's power him up.
He had a tough day, but he's responding now.
We can have him online in the next 24 hours.
But right now he needs a sleep cycle.
So do you.
We're all pulling for you, son.
We're counting on you to set things right.
Hi there.
How we doing, bucket-boy?
You know, it's my understanding that you're in possession of certain information that could lead to the conviction of one doctor Cray Mallardo.
That's a Robo no-no.
Let's see what 50 million zoiden gausses can do to help your total recall.
- All right, turn him on.
- Oh, very exciting.
How soon after we get the statement can you move on Mallardo?
Well, we've got a judge standing by to sign a warrant, a team of detectives to make the arrest; an hour, perhaps.
All right, bring him up to full power.
He's online.
- Hey, how are you feeling?
- Welcome back to Metro South.
Tell us everything you know about Cray Mallardo.
Hey, are you all right?
Who are you?
Lippencot?
There's nothing wrong with the circuits.
It's gotta be organic.
I just signed my company over to a madman!
Madigan, you assured me Robocop could incriminate him.
What's wrong with him?
Well, it looks to me like it's caught into delta wave degeneration.
- Will you please speak English, Lippencot?
- Amnesia.
Blow it.
Who am I?
This is really frustrating Sarge.
I can't stand it, getting away with murder and we've got nothing.
Look, without a witness or some kind of physical evidence,
- no judge will assure warrant for Mallardo.
- Okay, let's make a case, all right?
Some Dogtown boy at the crash pad where I found old Hank's body
- was bragging about some deal at OCP.
- Dogtown?
That orphan kid Gadget told me a crazy story about a suit with a syringe attacking some old guy in Dogtown.
Well, maybe that's not so crazy 'cause a hypocartridge I found had a schedule one chemical in it that only a doctor could have access to.
- Mallardo?
- Mallardo.
Now, why would you be kill homeless people in Old Detroit?
Well, if we can answer that question we'll crack this case wide open.
All right, I'll pay a visit to Family Services and have a little talk with Lamour...
That's great.
You know I tagged one of those punks the other night?
I'll hit the streets, I'll scan every Dogtowner I know, maybe we can turn a witness.
Open this door!
Open this door!
All right, cut it open.
I have designed a virus to clear out NeuroBrain;
unfortunately, there will be a few side-effects:
brownouts, blackouts and, generally speaking, a complete breakdown in a long order.
Doc, that's rough.
How long is that gonna last?
Well, it depends on how much cyberspace she occupies.
Now listen, Chip.
I am concerned that my enemies at OCP and in the police department might use the coming chaos to mount an assault against me.
Come on, doc, Robocop is toast.
You've won.
I need protection!
So, in your latest project, Fried Green Lasagne, it seems you've taken a stand against vulturous violence.
- What's that all about?
- Boys, this place is dump.
Well, Umberto, the modern man's got to get in touch with his feminine sides, you know?
I have found a child in question, Gadget, but she's only eight years old and I'm afraid it's past her bedtime.
I'll have to ask you to come back tomorrow.
What is going on here?
I'm on, I got a movie star in here!
Umberto, Umberto.
Boy do I have a story for you!
Hey!
Okay, all right.
What's the story you've got here, little one?
"I live at Family Services.
It's really a nasty place..."
Well,
I guess I know where my little friend learned how to lie.
What the...
Got business with the big guy here.
- Be my guest.
- Um... hi there.
Um... we don't really know each other, and this is going to be a strange to meet, but I have a feeling that we've got a lot in common.
Wow, someone really messed you up in here.
Let me take a look...
There's the problem.
I remember.
I'm at Public Works.
The same guy who tried to kill you is trying to kill me.
Please, come as fast as you can.
Wait a second, tell me about Mallardo!
Mallardo's wanted for murder.
- Did you hear that?
- Ah!
What's going?
Did I miss something?
Murder.
Murder!
This is Pudface, he's in charge.
Hey, I don't know anything about this guy, what are his politics?
Does he even know what we stand for?
Do as I say or I'll kill you.
How'd you like them politics, huh?
Chip, Chip, Chip.
These guys have their minds tight into their behinds.
If the heat gets turned up, their butter is going to melt.
- You know what I'm saying?
- Don't worry about it.
They're going to be the bait, you're going to be the hook.
Our security concepts manufactures some pretty nifty light artillery that'll make you look like a one man army.
Come on, you wanna see it?
Just a minute...
All right.
I like you.
You're all very good boys.
I don't care how you do it, don't let anyone in that door.
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.
Very good.
Come on, boys!
Let's make the square whole!
Ears up!
This is big time now, doggies.
OCP has got a special job for us.
Alright, we gonna take on the cops, man.
Hey, look!
Hey, it's the Murphy kid!
There's the reason the traitors snitched us.
- There he is!
- Get him!
Make dogmeat out of him!
You're dead, kid!
Okay, let's go boys, build the forts.
Build the army.
Build a new square!
Yeah, he's a snake.
Eat my shorts, douche-bag.
Jeez!
Police, hold it!
Drop the gun, lie face on the ground, now!
Drop all of it, now!
On the ground!
Give me your hand!
You're squeezing my fingers...
Shut up, punk.
Central, send a porta-perp to Edzel and Nader.
Tagger ID number 6684, officer Madigan, Lisa.
Dogtown incident, March 6, 21:00 hours.
All right, what did you do to make them so mad?
I don't know, I don't wanna join their stupid game.
- What's your name, tough guy?
- Jimmy.
Jimmy Murphy.
I know you, your dad was a cop, right?
Alex Murphy.
Yeah, but he got killed.
It sure messed up my mom.
I know your mom, too, Nancy.
So I wonder what your dad would think if he knew his son turned out to be a Dogtown boy?
I'm not a Dogtowner.
I went to Family Services 'cause I didn't want to live with my mom anymore.
Some counsellor there told me I was right for the Dogtown boys.
All right, listen.
I want you to come down to the station and talk to my sergeant, all right?
- You're gonna put me in jail?
- Not if you have a place to stay.
Oh, it won't do any good to throw a tantrum, it is too late for that now.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know;
a man can work all his life, create something truly magnificent and all it takes is one woman to completely screw it up.
This particular virus uses a transcendental number to seek out and delete all non-essential data... oh, that's you, by the way.
Boy, Umberto was surprised that you came all the way down here to get me.
- You must like me.
- Yeah?
Maybe I started, little one.
BD-10, come in.
BD-10, code 1.
BD-10, I'm on the air, go.
BD-10, we have classified unusual occurrence.
City wide mass of power failure with widespread looting potential.
BD-10, if it can walk and talk
I want it in uniform and I want it on the street now.
Roger, BD-10.
All units on frequency, stand by.
We have a city-wide unusual occurrence.
Metro South units... one.
Blackouts and power failures...
Listen, doggies.
We're gonna howl tonight.
The cops try to get by us, dust them.
Build the wall, let's go!
Soak it good, pour that gas on them, make the square strong!
All right!
Torching!
- This guy is crazy!
- One lousy cop?
We're gonna kill him!
Come quietly or there will be trouble.
Let him have it!
Charge him!
Come on!
Go back to school, punk.
Book him!
Well, you just better hope that oblivion is not as dreadful as it sounds.
Wow!
You stay here.
You again?
How many times do I need to take you out?
You're under arrest, Morgan.
In your dreams, robot!
I'm gonna open you up like a tin can, tin man!
- You stay in the car, all right?
- Yeah.
Hey, do me a favor, call your mom, huh?
You have the right to remain silent.
It was a lucky shot, you sack of bolts.
Come on, let's go.
Move it.
Doc, it's Robocop.
He's coming your way.
Please, help me...
Robo!
Why?
Why are you helping her?
Can't you see she's ruining everything?
She's got to be stopped!
Got to get the human out of the machine!
Stop!
She's gone.
She's gone!
I killed her.
I had to kill her twice,
- but the shrew is finally dead!
- You are under arrest.
Anything you say can and will be used against you.
Not again.
She's back!
How come there was never a guy like you around when I was still a girl?
Glad to be of assistance, ma'am.
Excuse me, I have to arrest Dr. Mallardo.
Don't worry, he won't get far.
- What've we got, Sarge?
- Hang on, Madigan.
Oh, don't shoot.
Chip Chayken, OCP.
Boy, am I glad to see you, fellows.
This is the creep I told you about, that's Mallardo's friend.
Yes, I guess we can safely say this.
That Mallardo had us all fooled.
Thank God for Robocop, anyway he's in there kicking ass right now.
- It's him!
- Who's him?
The Dogtown Ripper!
I don't know what you're talking about.
- But I do know you're lying.
- He's the one who gave old Hank a shot.
I think she's telling the truth.
Madigan, your case, your call.
You are under arrest, big shot.

I'm going to the airport, and I'm getting out on an airplane.

It's sad, really, the criminal mind.

Well, I guess it's time to get you back to Family services, huh?
No, I hate that place.
Well, I guess that means somebody's gonna have to adopt you.
Oh!
Okay, come on, come on.
- He must be here, he called me.
- Sorry, ma'am, no one's...
- Nancy, over here!
- Madigan!
All right, let her through!
- Have you seen Jimmy?
- He's fine, he's fine, he's right over there in my car.
Oh, Jimmy,
- I was so worried about you.
- Don't worry, mom, I'm okay.
How about now, Murph?
No.
They need a husband and a father.
- I can't be that.
- They're your family, Murphy.
Yes.

After breakfast, me and Milhouse are going down to the ravine.
We got a tip from a six-year-old that there's a dead Martian down there.
And I'm going to the park to jam with the Little White Girls Blues Quartet.
- Wanna come with me, Daddio?
- I'd love to, honey... but Daddy has to go to a beer-drinking contest today.
- Think you'll win?
- Son, when you participate in sporting events... it's not whether you win or lose, it's how drunk you get.
- Gotcha.
Well, gotta go.
- [ Homer, Lisa ] Me too.
Uh, it's hard for us to leave when you're standing there, Mom.
- Push her down, Son.
- No one's going anywhere.

- Hello?
- I won!
I won!
You win your choice of $10,000 or-- What's our gag prize this week, Bill?
[ Bill Laughs ] A full-grown African elephant.
Well, all that money sounds mighty tempting, Marty... but I think I'm gonna have to go with the elephant.
He's taking the elephant instead of the money.
- [ Marty Whispering ] The kid wants the elephant.
- We don't have a damn elephant.
- Don't whisper into the mike.
- [ Clears Throat ] Kid, the elephant's a gag prize.
- Nobody takes the gag prize.
You want the cash.
- I want the elephant.
[ Laughs ] Stick it to the man.
No, wait!
We'll call you back.
Bart, with $10,000, we'd be millionaires!
We could buy all kinds of useful things like...
love.
Or double-ply windows.
They look just like regular windows... but they'll save us four percent on our heating bill.
Well, they will.
You all seem to be forgetting the most important thing... which is, that it's wrong to imprison an animal.
- Lisa, go to your room.
- [ Man Laughing ]
We appreciate you coming down, but, look, kid.
The thing is, uh-- [ Chuckles ] we don't have an elephant.
[ Laughs ]
Come on, kid, just take the money, huh?
Otherwise, we might get fired.
- You don't want us to get fired, do you?
- Eh, either way.
[ Both Gasp ]
We think we know how your mind works, Bart, so how 'bout this?
We pay your principal $10,000 to pull down his pants...
- and keep 'em down for the rest of the school year.
- [ Laughs ]
- I'll do it, Bart.
- Um... no.
Okay, okay.
What if we use the 10,000 to surgically transform Skinner here... into a-- some kind of a lobster-like creature?
Well, now wait just a minute.
That wasn't discussed with me.
Uh, gentlemen, I am not leaving without my elephant.
- Hey!

Where's my elephant?

So, isn't that what we're all asking in our own lives?
Where's my elephant?
I know that's what I've been asking.

Look, our ratings are down, and the station is being swamped... with angry calls and letter bombs.

Whoa, that was the caller from hell.
Well, hot dog, we have a "wiener."

Oh, he smells worse than anything.
Hey, you, elephant!
Lift me up on your back, man.
Whoo!
[ Marge Gasps ] Bart!
[ Grunts ] Cool!
[ Chuckles ] He tried to kill me.
I really think this is a bad idea.
Marge, I agree with you in theory.
In theory, Communism works.
In theory.
Look, he thinks he's people.
[ Trumpets ]
I think I'm gonna call him Stampy.
[ Trumpets ]
- What's he yelling about?
- He's hungry.
Here you go, Stampy.
Eat it slow.
It has to last for--
You ate it too fast.
Maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move, it wouldn't get so hungry.
You can't do that, Dad.
It's cruel!
Oh, everything's cruel according to you.
Keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel.
Pulling on his tail is cruel.
Yelling in his ears is cruel.
Everything is cruel.
So excuse me if I'm cruel!

[ Swallowing ]
[ Crunching ]
[ Grunts ] I think you're taking unfair advantage of my generous offer.
- Shut up!
- [ Stampy, Labored Breathing ]
He can't just eat peanuts, Dad.
He needs plants to live.
Plants, eh?
[ Squirrels Chittering ]
Strip the bark now, Stampy.
- Hey, any more arboretums around here?
- No!
[ Gasps ] That bird!
He's killing the elephant!
Stop him!
No, Dad, he's grooming him.
Grooming him, eh?
Oh, Homer, there's a bird on your head.
I know.
He's grooming me.
Mm, elephant fresh.
[ Several Dogs Barking ]
[ Stampy Trumpets ]

Good night, Stampy.
[ Sniffing ]
[ Bart Sighs ]
[ Yawns, Grunts ]
Uh-
- Ahem.
Thanks, bud.
Appreciate it.
- Hmm.
- Taught Stampy any tricks yet, Bart?
Nah.
He doesn't wanna learn, and I don't wanna teach him.
We get along fine.
- [ Heavy Panting ]
- Hey, what's with them?
I think they're trying to get some attention.
Oh.
Good luck!
Look at these bills.
"Chain for elephant."
"Shots for elephant." "Oversized decorative poncho"!
Technically, it's for a giraffe, but I think I can let it out a little.
Well, these bills will have to be paid out of your allowance.
You'll have to raise my allowance to about $1 ,000 a week.
- Then that's what I'll do, smart guy.
- [ Doorbell Rings ]
- Can we see the elephant?
- We'll pay you money.
For the ninth time, no!
[ Doorbell Rings ]
Wait a minute.
This gives me an idea.
Mm, here's a better sign, Dad.
I don't have time to read it.
Just give me the gist of it, Son.
[ Playful Chattering ]
- [ Grunts ]
- Your kid flew five feet.
- That counts as a ride.
Two bucks.
- That was never five feet.
That animal of yours is certainly bad-tempered.
Yeah, well, you'd be grumpy too if you were taken out of your natural habitat... and gawked at by a bunch of slack-jawed yokels.
Hey, Ma, look at that pointy-hairded little girl.
[ Guffaws ]
You guys don't understand Stampy.
He's just like me.
We're a pair of jokers, and both of us are wild.
We don't take nothing from nobody.
[ Sighs ]
[ Laughs ] Smithers!
This reminds me of that fat man I used to ride to work.
- [ Groaning ] - [ Door Closes ]
Look at this, Marge.
$58 and all of it profit!
I'm the smartest businessman in the world.
Stampy's food bill today was $300.
Marge, please, don't humiliate me in front of the money.
[ Humming ]
[ Customers Reacting Negatively ]
[ Car Doors Slamming, Tires Screeching ]
[ Vehicles Departing ]
Um, Milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once, right?
Yes, but we paid you four dollars.
Well, that was under our old price structure.
Under our new price structure... your bill comes to a total of $700.
Now, you've already paid me four dollars... so that's just $696 more that you owe me.
Get off our property.
This town is full of deadbeats.
We can't afford this elephant.
No, Dad, he's my friend.
Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna have to sell him.
"["Mary Had A Little Lamb"]
- [ Roars ]
- Well, sir, I'll be honest with ya.
I need a large African elephant, and I need it today.
But I'm afraid this just isn't what I'm looking for.
What do you mean?
It's an elephant, isn't it?
Well, it is and it isn't, if you understand what I mean.
He likes peanuts.
Our wildlife refuge is the ideal environment for your elephant.
Thousands of acres of simulated African savannah.
It's perfect, Dad.
I only have two questions:
How much?
And give it to me.
Well, we really can't offer you any money.
- We're a nonprofit organization.
- So, your bid is zero?
- Well, we'd like to think of it as--
- Thank you.
- You know, I really think--
- Thank you.
Mr. Simpson, I think you'll find this amount more than fair.
Dad, I think he's an ivory dealer.
His boots are ivory.
His hat is ivory.
And I'm pretty sure that check is ivory.
Lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt Stampy... than a guy whose ivory supplies are low.
- [ Growling ] We love... you.
- [ Meows ]
- Mr. Blackheart?
- Yes, my pretty.
- Are you an ivory dealer?
- [ Laughs ]
Little girl, I've had lots of jobs in my day-- whale hunter, seal clubber, president of the Fox network--
And, like most people, yeah, I've dealt a little ivory.
Dad, you can't do this.
Stampy is my friend.
Don't worry, Son.
I'll get you a new elephant.
- I'll take that one too.
- Done.
- I'll be back in the morning to pick up Stampy.
- Here's the keys.
- Elephants don't have keys.
- I'll just keep these then.
Don't worry, Stampy.
I won't let Homer sell you to that ivory dealer.
You and I are gonna run away together.
We'll keep to the back roads and make our way south.
Then, if I know my geography, it's just 12 miles to Africa.
Okay, bud, very quietly, let's just sneak through- [ Grunts ] Stampy!
- [ Trumpets ]
[ Gasps ] Oh, it's the four elephants of the Apocalypse.
- That's horsemen, Ned.
- Well, getting closer.
Mom, Dad, Bart and Stampy are gone!
Oh, my Lord!
I bet it's because of that horrible ivory dealer, Dad.
He took Bart too?
That wasn't part of our deal, Blackheart!
That wasn't part!
Piece of cake.
All we have to do is follow the path of destruction.
Oh, stupid tornado!
[ Laughs ] Look.
It got Patty and Selma.
- [ Groans ] I feel it all the way up my skirt.
- Ditto.
- [ Trumpets ] - [ Men ] Whoa!
[ Men ] Whoa!
[ Chuckles ] Yeah, right, lady.
An elephant ran through your front yard.
Okay.
Wiggum.
Yeah, right, mister.
Mm-hmm.
An elephant just knocked over your mailbox.
Okay.
Wiggum.
Yeah, right, buddy.

This is the moment we've feared, people.
Many of you thought it would never happen... but I insisted we spend two hours every morning training for it.
You all thought I was mad.
Many of you requested to be transferred to another peanut factory.
- But now, we-- - [ Trumpets ]

Stampy, where are you, boy?

Oh.

- [ Loud Trumpeting ] - [ Gasps ] Stampy!
Mm.
Huh?
Oh, you're lonely for other elephants, aren't you?
- D'oh!
- A deer!
- A female deer.
Son, you're okay!
And you led us to the precious ivory.
And, of course, your lovable pet, who it's connected to.
Dad, I can't let you sell him.
Stampy and I are friends.
Ow!
Anyway, I want him to go to that animal refuge.
Forget it!
That elephant cost me thousands of dollars.
Dad, how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer?
- I'd like it fine.
- Even if he killed you... and made your teeth into piano keys?
Yes, of course I would.
Who wouldn't like that, to be part of the music scene?
- Dad, you're sinking!
- Huh?
- Get a rope, Bart.
- No, that's okay.
I'm pretty sure I can struggle my way out.
First, I'll just reach in and pull my legs out.
Now I'll pull my arms out with my face.
Mm.
[ Gurgling ]
- Dad!
- Homie!
Stampy, quick!
Pull him out!
Thanks, Stampy.
Ow!
[ Gasping ]
Ah, I'm alive!
I'm alive!
And I owe it all to this feisty feline.
Dad, feline means cat.
Elephant, honey.
It's an elephant.
And I'm sure he'll make a grand piano.
- [ Both ] Dad!
- Oh.
I guess it wouldn't be right to sell Stampy... after he saved my life.
And the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him.
- Thanks, Dad.
- On the other hand... who's to say what's right these days... what with all our modern ideas...
and products?
All right.
We'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal refuge.
[ Both ] Yea!
Uh, Mom, we're stuck to Dad.
[ Groans ] This is just what happened at the caramel factory.
- Ow!
- Ow, my hair!
- [ Grunting ]
- Mmm, caramel.
[ Trumpets ]
So long, Stampy.
I know you're gonna like it here.
No, Stampy, no!
[ Trumpets ]
[ Chuckles ] Oh, thanks, boy.
- [ Roars ]
- Whoa!
Whoa, boy!
Wh-Whoa!
- [ Grunts ] - [ Trumpets ]
[ Laughs ] Attaboy, Stampy.
Butt him once for me.
Gosh, I thought he'd be happier in his true habitat.
Oh, I think he is.
Then why is he attacking all those other elephants?
Well, animals are a lot like people, Mrs. Simpson.
- Some of them act badly because they've had a hard life--
- Stampy!
or have been mistreated.
But, like people, some of them are just jerks.
- Stop that, Mr. Simpson.

[ Both Gasp ]
We think we know how your mind works, Bart, so how 'bout this?
We pay your principal $1 0,000 to pull down his pants...
- and keep 'em down for the rest of the school year.
- [ Laughs ]
- I'll do it, Bart.
- Um... no.
Okay, okay.
What if we use the 1 0,000 to surgically transform Skinner here... into a-- some kind of a lobster-like creature?
Well, now wait just a minute.
That wasn't discussed with me.
Uh, gentlemen, I am not leaving without my elephant.
- Hey!
- Whee!
Where's my elephant?
- " [ Static, Mellow Music ] - [ Bart ] Where's my elephant?
Where's my elephant?

So, isn't that what we're all asking in our own lives?
Where's my elephant?
I know that's what I've been asking.

Look, our ratings are down, and the station is being swamped... with angry calls and letter bombs.
- And it's all your fault.
- Yes, it is, ma'am.
This is the DJ-3000.
It plays CDs automatically... and it has three distinct varieties of inane chatter.
[ Man ] Hey, hey, how about that weather out there?
Whoa, that was the caller from hell.
Well, hot dog, we have a "wiener."
Man, that thing's great.
Don't praise the machine.
If you don't get that kid an elephant by tomorrow, the DJ-3000 gets your job.

Oh, he smells worse than anything.
Hey, you, elephant!
Lift me up on your back, man.
Whoo!
[ Marge Gasps ] Bart!
[ Grunts ] Cool!
[ Chuckles ] He tried to kill me.
I really think this is a bad idea.
Marge, I agree with you in theory.
In theory, Communism works.
In theory.
Look, he thinks he's people.
[ Trumpets ]
I think I'm gonna call him Stampy.
[ Trumpets ]
- What's he yelling about?
- He's hungry.
Here you go, Stampy.
Eat it slow.
It has to last for--
You ate it too fast.
Maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move, it wouldn't get so hungry.
You can't do that, Dad.
It's cruel!
Oh, everything's cruel according to you.
Keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel.
Pulling on his tail is cruel.
Yelling in his ears is cruel.
Everything is cruel.
So excuse me if I'm cruel!

[ Swallowing ]

[ Grunts ] I think you're taking unfair advantage of my generous offer.
- Shut up!
- [ Stampy, Labored Breathing ]
He can't just eat peanuts, Dad.
He needs plants to live.
Plants, eh?
[ Squirrels Chittering ]
Strip the bark now, Stampy.
- Hey, any more arboretums around here?
- No!
[ Gasps ] That bird.!
He's killing the elephant.!
Stop him.!
No, Dad, he's grooming him.
Grooming him, eh?
Oh, Homer, there's a bird on your head.

He's grooming me.
Mm, elephant fresh.

[ Yawns, Grunts ]

- Ahem.
Thanks, bud.
Appreciate it.
- Hmm.
- Taught Stampy any tricks yet, Bart?
Nah.
He doesn't wanna learn, and I don't wanna teach him.
We get along fine.
- [ Heavy Panting ]
- Hey, what's with them?
I think they're trying to get some attention.
Oh.
Good luck!
Look at these bills.
"Chain for elephant."
"Shots for elephant." "Oversized decorative poncho"!
Technically, it's for a giraffe, but I think I can let it out a little.
Well, these bills will have to be paid out of your allowance.
You'll have to raise my allowance to about $1 ,000 a week.
- Then that's what I'll do, smart guy.
- [ Doorbell Rings ]
- Can we see the elephant?
- We'll pay you money.
For the ninth time, no!
[ Doorbell Rings ]
Wait a minute.
This gives me an idea.
Mm, here's a better sign, Dad.
I don't have time to read it.
Just give me the gist of it, Son.
[ Playful Chattering ]
- [ Grunts ]
- Your kid flew five feet.
- That counts as a ride.
Two bucks.
- That was never five feet.
That animal of yours is certainly bad-tempered.
Yeah, well, you'd be grumpy too if you were taken out of your natural habitat... and gawked at by a bunch of slack-jawed yokels.
Hey, Ma, look at that pointy-hairded little girl.
[ Guffaws ]
You guys don't understand Stampy.
He's just like me.
We're a pair of jokers, and both of us are wild.
We don't take nothing from nobody.
[ Sighs ]
[ Laughs ] Smithers.!
This reminds me of that fat man I used to ride to work.
- [ Groaning ] - [ Door Closes ]
Look at this, Marge.
$58 and all of it profit!
I'm the smartest businessman in the world.
Stampy's food bill today was $300.
Marge, please, don't humiliate me in front of the money.
[ Humming ]
[ Customers Reacting Negatively ]
[ Car Doors Slamming, Tires Screeching ]
[ Vehicles Departing ]
Um, Milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once, right?
Yes, but we paid you four dollars.
Well, that was under our old price structure.
Under our new price structure... your bill comes to a total of $7 00.
Now, you've already paid me four dollars... so that's just $696 more that you owe me.
Get off our property.
This town is full of deadbeats.
We can't afford this elephant.
No, Dad, he's my friend.
Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna have to sell him.
"["Mary Had A Little Lamb"]
- [ Roars ]
- Well, sir, I'll be honest with ya.
I need a large African elephant, and I need it today.
But I'm afraid this just isn't what I'm looking for.
What do you mean?
It's an elephant, isn't it?
Well, it is and it isn't, if you understand what I mean.
He likes peanuts.
Our wildlife refuge is the ideal environment for your elephant.
Thousands of acres of simulated African savannah.
It's perfect, Dad.
I only have two questions:
How much?
And give it to me.
Well, we really can't offer you any money.
- We're a nonprofit organization.
- So, your bid is zero?
- Well, we'd like to think of it as--
- Thank you.
- You know, I really think--
- Thank you.
Mr. Simpson, I think you'll find this amount more than fair.
Dad, I think he's an ivory dealer.
His boots are ivory.
His hat is ivory.
And I'm pretty sure that check is ivory.
Lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt Stampy... than a guy whose ivory supplies are low.
- [ Growling ] We love... you.
- [ Meows ]
- Mr. Blackheart?
- Yes, my pretty.
- Are you an ivory dealer?
- [ Laughs ]
Little girl, I've had lots of jobs in my day-- whale hunter, seal clubber, president of the Fox network--
And, like most people, yeah, I've dealt a little ivory.
Dad, you can't do this.
Stampy is my friend.
Don't worry, Son.
I'll get you a new elephant.
- I'll take that one too.
- Done.
- I'll be back in the morning to pick up Stampy.
- Here's the keys.
- Elephants don't have keys.
- I'll just keep these then.
Don't worry, Stampy.
I won't let Homer sell you to that ivory dealer.
You and I are gonna run away together.
We'll keep to the back roads and make our way south.
Then, if I know my geography, it's just 1 2 miles to Africa.
Okay, bud, very quietly, let's just sneak through- [ Grunts ] Stampy!
- [ Trumpets ]
[ Gasps ] Oh, it's the four elephants of the Apocalypse.
- That's horsemen, Ned.
- Well, getting closer.
Mom, Dad, Bart and Stampy are gone!
Oh, my Lord!
I bet it's because of that horrible ivory dealer, Dad.
He took Bart too?
That wasn't part of our deal, Blackheart!
That wasn't part!
Piece of cake.
All we have to do is follow the path of destruction.
Oh, stupid tornado!
[ Laughs ] Look.
It got Patty and Selma.
- [ Groans ] I feel it all the way up my skirt.
- Ditto.
- [ Trumpets ] - [ Men ] Whoa!
[ Men ] Whoa!
[ Chuckles ] Yeah, right, lady.
An elephant ran through your front yard.
Okay.

Yeah, right, mister.
Mm-hmm.
An elephant just knocked over your mailbox.
Okay.

This is the moment we've feared, people.
Many of you thought it would never happen... but I insisted we spend two hours every morning training for it.
You all thought I was mad.
Many of you requested to be transferred to another peanut factory.
- But now, we-- - [ Trumpets ]

Oh.
He's gone forever.
- [ Loud Trumpeting ] - [ Gasps ] Stampy!
Mm.
Huh?
Oh, you're lonely for other elephants, aren't you?
- D'oh!
- A deer!
- A female deer.
Son, you're okay!
And you led us to the precious ivory.
And, of course, your lovable pet, who it's connected to.
Dad, I can't let you sell him.
Stampy and I are friends.
Ow!
Anyway, I want him to go to that animal refuge.
Forget it!
That elephant cost me thousands of dollars.
Dad, how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer?
- I'd like it fine.
- Even if he killed you... and made your teeth into piano keys?
Yes, of course I would.
Who wouldn't like that, to be part of the music scene?
- Dad, you're sinking!
- Huh?
- Get a rope, Bart.
- No, that's okay.
I'm pretty sure I can struggle my way out.
First, I'll just reach in and pull my legs out.
Now I'll pull my arms out with my face.
Mm.
[ Gurgling ]
- Dad!
- Homie!
Stampy, quick!
Pull him out!
Thanks, Stampy.
Ow!
[ Gasping ]
Ah, I'm alive!
I'm alive!
And I owe it all to this feisty feline.
Dad, feline means cat.
Elephant, honey.
It's an elephant.
And I'm sure he'll make a grand piano.
- [ Both ] Dad!
- Oh.
I guess it wouldn't be right to sell Stampy... after he saved my life.
And the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him.
- Thanks, Dad.
- On the other hand... who's to say what's right these days... what with all our modern ideas...
and products?
All right.
We'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal refuge.
[ Both ] Yea!
Uh, Mom, we're stuck to Dad.
[ Groans ] This is just what happened at the caramel factory.
- Ow!
- Ow, my hair!
- [ Grunting ]
- Mmm, caramel.
[ Trumpets ]
So long, Stampy.
I know you're gonna like it here.
No, Stampy, no!
[ Trumpets ]
[ Chuckles ] Oh, thanks, boy.
- [ Roars ]
- Whoa!
Whoa, boy!
Wh-Whoa!
- [ Grunts ] - [ Trumpets ]
[ Laughs ] Attaboy, Stampy.
Butt him once for me.
Gosh, I thought he'd be happier in his true habitat.
Oh, I think he is.
Then why is he attacking all those other elephants?
Well, animals are a lot like people, Mrs. Simpson.
- Some of them act badly because they've had a hard life--
- Stampy!
or have been mistreated.
But, like people, some of them are just jerks.

And I'm going to the park to jam with the Little White Girls Blues Quartet.
- Wanna come with me, Daddio?
- I'd love to, honey... but Daddy has to go to a beer-drinking contest today.
- Think you'll win?
- Son, when you participate in sporting events... it's not whether you win or lose, it's how drunk you get.
- Gotcha.
Well, gotta go.
- [ Homer, Lisa ] Me too.
Uh, it's hard for us to leave when you're standing there, Mom.
- Push her down, Son.

You and I are gonna run away together.
We'll keep to the back roads and make our way south.
Then, if I know my geography, it's just 12 miles to Africa.
Okay, bud, very quietly, let's just sneak through- [ Grunts ] Stampy!
- [ Trumpets ]
[ Gasps ] Oh, it's the four elephants of the Apocalypse.
- That's horsemen, Ned.
- Well, getting closer.
Mom, Dad, Bart and Stampy are gone!
Oh, my Lord!
I bet it's because of that horrible ivory dealer, Dad.
He took Bart too?
That wasn't part of our deal, Blackheart!
That wasn't part!
Piece of cake.
All we have to do is follow the path of destruction.
Oh, stupid tornado!
[ Laughs ] Look.
It got Patty and Selma.
- [ Groans ] I feel it all the way up my skirt.
- Ditto.
- [ Trumpets ] - [ Men ] Whoa!
[ Men ] Whoa!
[ Chuckles ] Yeah, right, lady.
An elephant ran through your front yard.
Okay.

Yeah, right, mister.
Mm-hmm.
An elephant just knocked over your mailbox.

This is the moment we've feared, people.
Many of you thought it would never happen... but I insisted we spend two hours every morning training for it.
You all thought I was mad.
Many of you requested to be transferred to another peanut factory.
- But now, we-- - [ Trumpets ]
Stampy!
Stampy, where are you, boy?

Stampy, where are you, boy?
- [ Trumpeting ]
- Huh?

Huh?
Oh, you're lonely for other elephants, aren't you?
- D'oh!
- A deer!
- A female deer.
Son, you're okay!
And you led us to the precious ivory.
And, of course, your lovable pet, who it's connected to.
Dad, I can't let you sell him.
Stampy and I are friends.
Ow!
Anyway, I want him to go to that animal refuge.
Forget it!
That elephant cost me thousands of dollars.
Dad, how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer?
- I'd like it fine.
- Even if he killed you... and made your teeth into piano keys?
Yes, of course I would.
Who wouldn't like that, to be part of the music scene?
- Dad, you're sinking!
- Huh?
- Get a rope, Bart.
- No, that's okay.
I'm pretty sure I can struggle my way out.
First, I'll just reach in and pull my legs out.
Now I'll pull my arms out with my face.
Mm.
[ Gurgling ]
- Dad!
- Homie!
Stampy, quick!
Pull him out!
Thanks, Stampy.
Ow!
[ Gasping ]
Ah, I'm alive!
I'm alive!
And I owe it all to this feisty feline.
Dad, feline means cat.
Elephant, honey.
It's an elephant.
And I'm sure he'll make a grand piano.
- [ Both ] Dad!
- Oh.
I guess it wouldn't be right to sell Stampy... after he saved my life.
And the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him.
- Thanks, Dad.
- On the other hand... who's to say what's right these days... what with all our modern ideas...
and products?
All right.
We'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal refuge.
[ Both ] Yea!
Uh, Mom, we're stuck to Dad.
[ Groans ] This is just what happened at the caramel factory.
- Ow!
- Ow, my hair!
- [ Grunting ]
- Mmm, caramel.

Butt him once for me.
Gosh, I thought he'd be happier in his true habitat.
Oh, I think he is.
Then why is he attacking all those other elephants?
Well, animals are a lot like people, Mrs. Simpson.
- Some of them act badly because they've had a hard life--
- Stampy!

But, like people, some of them are just jerks.

After breakfast, me and Milhouse are going down to the ravine.
We got a tip from a six-year-old that there's a dead Martian down there.
And I'm going to the park to jam with the Little White Girls Blues Quartet.
- Wanna come with me, Daddio?
- I'd love to, honey... but Daddy has to go to a beer-drinking contest today.
- Think you'll win?
- Son, when you participate in sporting events... it's not whether you win or lose, it's how drunk you get.
- Gotcha.
Well, gotta go.
- [ Homer, Lisa ] Me too.
Uh, it's hard for us to leave when you're standing there, Mom.
- Push her down, Son.
- No one's going anywhere.
We're going to clean the whole house from top to bottom.
- [ Gasps ] - [ Gasps ]
Oh, dear God, no!
[ Panting, Struggling ]
I think you'll find that escape is impossible.
Now, each one of you take a floor and get started.
- I call the basement.
- [ All ] Fine.
D'oh?
D'oh!
- [ Squeaking ]
- I'm tired.
I'm hungry.
Can't we just buy a new house?
Oh, Bart, cleaning doesn't have to be a chore.

"Another day older and deeper in debt "
- Amen, Ernie.

- Hello.
- KBBL is gonna give me something stupid!
- Well, hot dog, we have a "wiener." - [ Alarm Sounds ]
- Hello?
- I won!
I won!
You win your choice of $1 0,000 or-- What's our gag prize this week, Bill?
[ Bill Laughs ] A full-grown African elephant.
Well, all that money sounds mighty tempting, Marty... but I think I'm gonna have to go with the elephant.
He's taking the elephant instead of the money.
- [ Marty Whispering ] The kid wants the elephant.
- We don't have a damn elephant.
- Don't whisper into the mike.
- [ Clears Throat ] Kid, the elephant's a gag prize.
- Nobody takes the gag prize.
You want the cash.
- I want the elephant.
[ Laughs ] Stick it to the man.
No, wait!
We'll call you back.
Bart, with $1 0,000, we'd be millionaires!
We could buy all kinds of useful things like...
love.
Or double-ply windows.
They look just like regular windows... but they'll save us four percent on our heating bill.
Well, they will.
You all seem to be forgetting the most important thing... which is, that it's wrong to imprison an animal.
- Lisa, go to your room.
- [ Man Laughing ]
We appreciate you coming down, but, look, kid.
The thing is, uh-- [ Chuckles ] we don't have an elephant.
[ Laughs ]
Come on, kid,just take the money, huh?
Otherwise, we might get fired.
- You don't want us to get fired, do you?
- Eh, either way.
[ Both Gasp ]
We think we know how your mind works, Bart, so how 'bout this?
We pay your principal $1 0,000 to pull down his pants...
- and keep 'em down for the rest of the school year.
- [ Laughs ]
- I'll do it, Bart.
- Um... no.
Okay, okay.
What if we use the 1 0,000 to surgically transform Skinner here... into a-- some kind of a lobster-like creature?
Well, now wait just a minute.
That wasn't discussed with me.
Uh, gentlemen, I am not leaving without my elephant.

Look, our ratings are down, and the station is being swamped... with angry calls and letter bombs.

Hey, you, elephant!
Lift me up on your back, man.
Whoo!
[ Marge Gasps ] Bart!
[ Grunts ] Cool!
[ Chuckles ] He tried to kill me.
I really think this is a bad idea.
Marge, I agree with you in theory.
In theory, Communism works.
In theory.
Look, he thinks he's people.
[ Trumpets ]
I think I'm gonna call him Stampy.
[ Trumpets ]
- What's he yelling about?
- He's hungry.
Here you go, Stampy.
Eat it slow.
It has to last for--
You ate it too fast.
Maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move, it wouldn't get so hungry.
You can't do that, Dad.
It's cruel!
Oh, everything's cruel according to you.
Keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel.
Pulling on his tail is cruel.
Yelling in his ears is cruel.
Everything is cruel.
So excuse me if I'm cruel!

- Shut up!
- [ Stampy, Labored Breathing ]
He can't just eat peanuts, Dad.
He needs plants to live.
Plants, eh?
[ Squirrels Chittering ]
Strip the bark now, Stampy.
- Hey, any more arboretums around here?
- No!
[ Gasps ] That bird.!
He's killing the elephant.!
Stop him.!
No, Dad, he's grooming him.
Grooming him, eh?
Oh, Homer, there's a bird on your head.
I know.
He's grooming me.
Mm, elephant fresh.

Uh-
- Ahem.

- Hmm.
- Taught Stampy any tricks yet, Bart?
Nah.
He doesn't wanna learn, and I don't wanna teach him.
We get along fine.
- [ Heavy Panting ]
- Hey, what's with them?
I think they're trying to get some attention.
Oh.
Good luck!
Look at these bills.
"Chain for elephant."
"Shots for elephant." "Oversized decorative poncho"!
Technically, it's for a giraffe, but I think I can let it out a little.
Well, these bills will have to be paid out of your allowance.
You'll have to raise my allowance to about $1 ,000 a week.
- Then that's what I'll do, smart guy.
- [ Doorbell Rings ]
- Can we see the elephant?
- We'll pay you money.
For the ninth time, no!
[ Doorbell Rings ]
Wait a minute.
This gives me an idea.
Mm, here's a better sign, Dad.
I don't have time to read it.
Just give me the gist of it, Son.
[ Playful Chattering ]
- [ Grunts ]
- Your kid flew five feet.
- That counts as a ride.
Two bucks.
- That was never five feet.
That animal of yours is certainly bad-tempered.
Yeah, well, you'd be grumpy too if you were taken out of your natural habitat... and gawked at by a bunch of slack-jawed yokels.
Hey, Ma, look at that pointy-hairded little girl.
[ Guffaws ]
You guys don't understand Stampy.
He's just like me.
We're a pair of jokers, and both of us are wild.
We don't take nothing from nobody.
[ Sighs ]
[ Laughs ] Smithers.!
This reminds me of that fat man I used to ride to work.
- [ Groaning ] - [ Door Closes ]
Look at this, Marge.
$58 and all of it profit!
I'm the smartest businessman in the world.
Stampy's food bill today was $300.
Marge, please, don't humiliate me in front of the money.
[ Humming ]
[ Customers Reacting Negatively ]
[ Car Doors Slamming, Tires Screeching ]
[ Vehicles Departing ]
Um, Milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once, right?
Yes, but we paid you four dollars.
Well, that was under our old price structure.
Under our new price structure... your bill comes to a total of $7 00.
Now, you've already paid me four dollars... so that's just $696 more that you owe me.
Get off our property.
This town is full of deadbeats.
We can't afford this elephant.
No, Dad, he's my friend.
Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna have to sell him.
"["Mary Had A Little Lamb"]
- [ Roars ]
- Well, sir, I'll be honest with ya.
I need a large African elephant, and I need it today.
But I'm afraid this just isn't what I'm looking for.
What do you mean?
It's an elephant, isn't it?
Well, it is and it isn't, if you understand what I mean.
He likes peanuts.
Our wildlife refuge is the ideal environment for your elephant.
Thousands of acres of simulated African savannah.
It's perfect, Dad.
I only have two questions:
How much?
And give it to me.
Well, we really can't offer you any money.
- We're a nonprofit organization.
- So, your bid is zero?
- Well, we'd like to think of it as--
- Thank you.
- You know, I really think--
- Thank you.
Mr. Simpson, I think you'll find this amount more than fair.
Dad, I think he's an ivory dealer.
His boots are ivory.
His hat is ivory.
And I'm pretty sure that check is ivory.
Lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt Stampy... than a guy whose ivory supplies are low.
- [ Growling ] We love... you.
- [ Meows ]
- Mr. Blackheart?
- Yes, my pretty.
- Are you an ivory dealer?
- [ Laughs ]
Little girl, I've had lots of jobs in my day-- whale hunter, seal clubber, president of the Fox network--
And, like most people, yeah, I've dealt a little ivory.
Dad, you can't do this.
Stampy is my friend.
Don't worry, Son.
I'll get you a new elephant.
- I'll take that one too.
- Done.
- I'll be back in the morning to pick up Stampy.
- Here's the keys.
- Elephants don't have keys.
- I'll just keep these then.
Don't worry, Stampy.
I won't let Homer sell you to that ivory dealer.
You and I are gonna run away together.
We'll keep to the back roads and make our way south.
Then, if I know my geography, it's just 1 2 miles to Africa.

- We don't have a damn elephant.
Don't whisper into the mike.
- Kid, the elephant's a gag prize.
Nobody takes the gag prize.
You want the cash.
I want the elephant.
Stick it to the man.
No, wait!
We'll call you back.
Bart, with $10,000, we'd be millionaires!
We could buy all kinds of useful things like...
love.
Or double-ply windows.
They look just like regular windows... but they'll save us four percent on our heating bill.
Well, they will.
You all seem to be forgetting the most important thing... which is, that it's wrong to imprison an animal.
Lisa, go to your room.
-
We appreciate you coming down, but, look, kid.
The thing is, uh-- we don't have an elephant.
Come on, kid, just take the money, huh?
Otherwise, we might get fired.
You don't want us to get fired, do you?
- Eh, either way.
We think we know how your mind works, Bart, so how 'bout this?
We pay your principal $10,000 to pull down his pants... and keep 'em down for the rest of the school year.
I'll do it, Bart.
- Um... no.
Okay, okay.
What if we use the $10,000 to surgically transform Skinner here... into a-- some kind of a lobster-like creature?
Well, now wait just a minute.
That wasn't discussed with me.
Uh, gentlemen, I am not leaving without my elephant.
Hey!
- Whee!
Where's my elephant?
'
- Where's my elephant?
Where's my elephant?
'
- Where's my elephant?
Hey, they're playing 'The Elephant Song.'
I love that.
Reminds me of elephants.
So, isn't that what we're all asking in our own lives?
Where's my elephant?
I know that's what I've been asking.
Look, our ratings are down, and the station is being swamped... with angry calls and letter bombs.
And it's all your fault.
- Yes, it is, ma'am.
This is the DJ-3000.
It plays CDs automatically... and it has three distinct varieties of inane chatter.
Hey, hey, how about that weather out there?
Whoa, that was the caller from hell.
Well, hot dog, we have a 'wiener.'
Man, that thing's great.
Don't praise the machine.
If you don't get that kid an elephant by tomorrow, the DJ-3000 gets your job.
Looks like those clowns in Congress did it again.
What a bunch of clowns.
-
How does he keep up with the news like that?
Whoo-ho-ho-ho!
- Homer?
It looks like it could gore.
It does look like Al Gore.
Oh, he smells worse than anything.
Hey, you, elephant!
Lift me up on your back, man.
Whoo!
Bart!
Cool!
He tried to kill me.
I really think this is a bad idea.
Marge, I agree with you in theory.
In theory, Communism works.
In theory.
Look, he thinks he's people.
I think I'm gonna call him Stampy.
What's he yelling about?
- He's hungry.
Here you go, Stampy.
Eat it slow.
It has to last for--
You ate it too fast.
Maybe if we tied it down so it couldn't move, it wouldn't get so hungry.
You can't do that, Dad.
It's cruel!
Oh, everything's cruel according to you.
Keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel.
Pulling on his tail is cruel.
Yelling in his ears is cruel.
Everything is cruel.
So excuse me if I'm cruel!
Now I've had my head in an elephant, a hippo and a giant sloth.
I think you're taking unfair advantage of my generous offer.
Shut up!
-
He can't just eat peanuts, Dad.
He needs plants to live.
Plants, eh?
Strip the bark now, Stampy.
Hey, any more arboretums around here?
- No!
That bird.!
He's killing the elephant.!
Stop him.!
No, Dad, he's grooming him.
Grooming him, eh?
Oh, Homer, there's a bird on your head.
I know.
He's grooming me.
Mm, elephant fresh.
Good night, Stampy.
Uh-
- Ahem.
Thanks, bud.
Appreciate it.
Hmm.
- Taught Stampy any tricks yet, Bart?
Nah.
He doesn't wanna learn, and I don't wanna teach him.
We get along fine.
- Hey, what's with them?
I think they're trying to get some attention.
Oh.
Good luck!
Look at these bills.
'Chain for elephant.'
'Shots for elephant.' 'Oversized decorative poncho'!
Technically, it's for a giraffe, but I think I can let it out a little.
Well, these bills will have to be paid out of your allowance.
You'll have to raise my allowance to about $1,000 a week.
Then that's what I'll do, smart guy.
-
Can we see the elephant?
- We'll pay you money.
For the ninth time, no!
Wait a minute.
This gives me an idea.
Mm, here's a better sign, Dad.
I don't have time to read it.
Just give me the gist of it, Son.
- Your kid flew five feet.
That counts as a ride.
Two bucks.
- That was never five feet.
That animal of yours is certainly bad-tempered.
Yeah, well, you'd be grumpy too... if you were taken out of your natural habitat... and gawked at by a bunch of slack-jawed yokels.
Hey, Ma, look at that pointy-hairded little girl.
You guys don't understand Stampy.
He's just like me.
We're a pair of jokers, and both of us are wild.
We don't take nothing from nobody.
Smithers.!
This reminds me of that fat man I used to ride to work.
Look at this, Marge.
$58 and all of it profit!
I'm the smartest businessman in the world.
Stampy's food bill today was $300.
Marge, please, don't humiliate me in front of the money.
Um, Milhouse saw the elephant twice and rode him once, right?
Yes, but we paid you four dollars.
Well, that was under our old price structure.
Under our new price structure... your bill comes to a total of $7 00.
Now, you've already paid me four dollars... so that's just $696 more that you owe me.
Get off our property.
This town is full of deadbeats.
We can't afford this elephant.
No, Dad, he's my friend.
Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna have to sell him.
- Well, sir, I'll be honest with ya.
I need a large African elephant, and I need it today.
But I'm afraid this just isn't what I'm looking for.
What do you mean?
It's an elephant, isn't it?
Well, it is and it isn't, if you understand what I mean.
He likes peanuts.
Our wildlife refuge is the ideal environment for your elephant.
Thousands of acres of simulated African savannah.
It's perfect, Dad.
I only have two questions:
How much?
And give it to me.
Well, we really can't offer you any money.
We're a nonprofit organization.
- So, your bid is zero?
Well, we'd like to think of it as--
- Thank you.
You know, I really think--
- Thank you.
Mr. Simpson, I think you'll find this amount more than fair.
Dad, I think he's an ivory dealer.
His boots are ivory.
His hat is ivory.
And I'm pretty sure that check is ivory.
Lisa, a guy who has lots of ivory is less likely to hurt Stampy... than a guy whose ivory supplies are low.
We love... you.
-
Mr. Blackheart?
- Yes, my pretty.
Are you an ivory dealer?
-
Little girl, I've had lots of jobs in my day-- whale hunter, seal clubber, president of the Fox network--
And, like most people, yeah, I've dealt a little ivory.
Dad, you can't do this.
Stampy is my friend.
Don't worry, Son.
I'll get you a new elephant.
I'll take that one too.
- Done.
I'll be back in the morning to pick up Stampy.
Here's the keys.
Elephants don't have keys.
- I'll just keep these then.
Don't worry, Stampy.
I won't let Homer sell you to that ivory dealer.
You and I are gonna run away together.
We'll keep to the back roads and make our way south.
Then, if I know my geography, it's just 1 2 miles to Africa.
Okay, bud, very quietly, let's just sneak through--
Stampy!
-
Oh, it's the four elephants of the Apocalypse.
That's horsemen, Ned.
- Well, getting closer.
Mom, Dad, Bart and Stampy are gone!
Oh, my Lord!
I bet it's because of that horrible ivory dealer, Dad.
He took Bart too?
That wasn't part of our deal, Blackheart!
That wasn't part!
Piece of cake.
All we have to do is follow the path of destruction.
Oh, stupid tornado!
Look.
It got Patty and Selma.
I feel it all the way up my skirt.
- Ditto.
- Whoa!
Whoa!
Yeah, right, lady.
An elephant ran through your front yard.
Okay.
Wiggum.
Yeah, right, mister.
Mm-hmm.
An elephant just knocked over your mailbox.
Okay.
Wiggum.
Yeah, right, buddy.
Liquor store robbery, officer down.
Sure.
And I'm Edward G. Robinson.
Waah!
- Whoa!
This is the moment we've feared, people.
Many of you thought it would never happen... but I insisted we spend two hours every morning training for it.
You all thought I was mad.
Many of you requested to be transferred to another peanut factory.
But now, we-- -
Stampy!
Stampy, where are you, boy?
Stampy!
Stampy, where are you, boy?
- Huh?
These prehistoric creatures blundered into the tar pits... which presered their skeletons in showroom condition.
Oh.
He's gone forever.
- Stampy!
Mm.
Huh?
Oh, you're lonely for other elephants, aren't you?
D'oh!
- A deer!
A female deer.
Son, you're okay!
And you led us to the precious ivory.
And, of course, your lovable pet, who it's connected to.
Dad, I can't let you sell him.
Stampy and I are friends.
Ow!
Anyway, I want him to go to that animal refuge.
Forget it!
That elephant cost me thousands of dollars.
Dad, how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer?
I'd like it fine.
- Even if he killed you... and made your teeth into piano keys?
Yes, of course I would.
Who wouldn't like that, to be part of the music scene?
Dad, you're sinking!
- Huh?
Get a rope, Bart.
- No, that's okay.
I'm pretty sure I can struggle my way out.
First, I'll just reach in and pull my legs out.
Now I'll pull my arms out with my face.
Mm.
Dad!
- Homie!
Stampy, quick!
Pull him out!
Thanks, Stampy.
Ow!
Ah, I'm alive!
I'm alive!
And I owe it all to this feisty feline.
Dad, feline means cat.
Elephant, honey.
It's an elephant.
And I'm sure he'll make a grand piano.
Dad!
- Oh.
I guess it wouldn't be right to sell Stampy... after he saved my life.
And the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him.
Thanks, Dad.
- On the other hand... who's to say what's right these days... what with all our modern ideas...
and products?
All right.
We'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal refuge.
Yea!
Uh, Mom, we're stuck to Dad.
This is just what happened at the caramel factory.
Ow!
- Ow, my hair!
- Mmm, caramel.
So long, Stampy.
I know you're gonna like it here.
No, Stampy, no!
Oh, thanks, boy.
- Whoa!
Whoa, boy!
Wh-Whoa!
Attaboy, Stampy.
Butt him once for me.
Gosh, I thought he'd be happier in his true habitat.
Oh, I think he is.
Then why is he attacking all those other elephants?
Well, animals are a lot like people, Mrs. Simpson.
Some of them act badly because they've had a hard life--
Stampy!
or have been mistreated.
But, like people, some of them are just jerks.
Stop that, Mr. Simpson.
The moon is so pretty.
Sing, whenever the moon is so pretty, make a wish.
Then your wish will come true.
- Really?
- Yeah!
Moon,
I wish to be an Official.
I want to be a decent one, to arrest criminals and corrupted officials.
"Fair and Justice"
Who comes early in the morning?
Broken drum!
Broken board!
Poor court!
Ask you poor official out.
How dare you insult our Honour?
He is just a junior official.
He doesn't worth to be insulted by me, Mr. Fong Tong Kan.
Fong Tong Kan?
Are you the best lawyer in Canton, nick named "Mirror Fong"?
This is the lawsuit.
I represent Mr. Lin to accuse Wong Lo-chou's wife.
When Mr. Lam went to collect rent, she tried... to rape Mr. Lin.
You are framing me.
It was Mr. Lin who wanted to rape me wife.
Where is His Honour?
He's gone to your grandpa's home.
Check!
No way, I'll sit out.
I check again.
I will kill your king.
Don't think that you are great as being a magistrate.
How can I compete with you?
Have you remember what I told you?
You should be a decent and honest official.
Dad, but you were a...
Yes, I was corrupted official.
I could do anything for money.
Since I did so many bad deeds.
So, twelve of your brothers died before me.
Your brothers died one after another.
I could do nothing, but retried... - and donated all my wealth for charity.
That's why your live is kept.
See, I wrote a word for you as decoration.
That's "HONEST".
But, I think It's like the word "Poverty".
Uncle... what a big trouble...
- Uncle, grandpa.
- What's the matter?
Come, come and have some sweet soup.
It's delicious.
Kau, come and eat.
Mom, I am Sing, your 13th son.
Do I have so many sons?
Kid, who are you looking for?
I am your husband.
How about you?
I am your grandson, grandma.
My lovely little girl, you are so tall now.
Hubby, eat now, or it will get cold.
I am Sing, Mom.
Uncle, we will be rich.
Let "Mirrow Fong" lead the show.
We will get advantage in the middle.
Well done.
I've wasted so much to buy this post,
I just want money.
You bad kid.
I asked you not be corrupted official, why don't you listen to me?
Mirror Fong is the first lawyer in Canton.
Do you want to compete with him?
Stop dreaming.
It's alright, dad, I know it.
- Let's go.
- Grandpa, we are leaving.
Son, don't forget to take my calligraphy.
That calligraphy is left for you.
Why are you standing?
I am Fong Tong Kan.
Being a scholar, I needn't kneel in front of you.
How cocky you are!
You always help the rich to bully the poor.
Just like sending others shit in snowy season.
Be careful, if he passes the examination, he will be your senior.
I don't care, now.
I do want to teach you a lesson.
Thank you...
I've heard that your mom is hospitable.
No matter local people of foreigners, she won't mind.
I've known... that you always greet others "God-father".
You are welcome, but my mom is really hospitable.
No, he means your mom is hooker.
You mean my mom is a hooker, right?
Well, when did you see me... sending others shit in snowy season?
This is only a description.
Well, I mean... you mom is friendly only.
I don't always greet others God-father, you...
I don't know that.
But Wong's wife did intend... to rape Mr. Lin.
Please give her appropriate punishment.
His wife intended to rape him?
I am framed, sir.
Mr. Lin came to collate rent, he wanted to indecent assault her.
When I came back, I saw him holding my wife's hands.
He pressed my wife on the table, and wanted to rape her.
I couldn't help attacking him with the rod.
His fellows rushed in at once, and held me.
Lin Chi-Yong, you held other's hands.
Obviously, you wanted to rape his wife.
Sir, you are so smart today.
Really?
You look great.
I am always look great.
Are you your palms red?
Show me please.
What are you doing?
You said, holding hands mean raping, so, am I raping you now?
Take a seat and watch my show.
The fact is, Mr. Lin wanted to take his house back, for Wong and his wife didn't pay the rent.
They do want to blackmail...
Mr. Lin by raping him.
Please give a fair judgement.
No, sir.
The house was rented by Mr. Line's dad to my dad.
Since my dad saved his dad's life.
So, his dad let us the house which charges 30 tales a year.
We pay the rent every year.
Do are have and life deeds?
Show me.
- Yes.
- So tiny is this?
!
Well, why not this one?
It's father.
Which one do you want?
Big one please, I've got father of it.
Good boy.
You did greet me "God-father".
Right?
Would you read it out?
I, Lin Da-fu, am renting the house in Tai Shu Street... to my benefactor Wong, so as to repay his merit.
If no rent is paid, never mind charge 30 taels a year.
Do not collect it and rent to others.
My sons and grandsons should follow this title-deeds.
See?
Your dad said, you can't blame him if he doesn't pay the rent.
Instead, he pays the rent every year, how can you collect his house.
We pay 30 taels a year.
What?
It should be $300,000 taels.
What did you say?
Are you literate?
I know you are not.
Let me teach you.
You should read this in this way.
The house is rented to Wong, so as to repay his merit.
If no rent is paid, never mind charging $300,000 taels a year.
Do notice, collect it and rent to others.
How can you amend it like this?
Can you make your judgement now?
Do you want to be bribed from a delayed judgement?
This cheque for $3,000 taels, is not yours.
This is for you, you worth this much only.
Take it.
One tael?
- If you don't want it, just forget it.
- No.
Hurry up.
Announce your judgement now.
Wong didn't pay the rent, you should move out as soon as possible.
Return the house to Lin Chi-yong.
About the raping case, since she couldn't make it, just forget it.
Mr. Lin is so generous.
See you!
What a unfair world!
God-son, take me advice, you'd better go home and be a farmer.
How can you be an official?
You will never stop losing face, boy!
The Chi's sedan chair is here to pick up the bride.
Who is going to marry that consumptive?
Even Pao Lung Sing can be the government official, everything can happen.
Come on, have some tea.
Uncle, where are you going to?
I would like to take a walk.
- No...
- Why?
That's too mush.
Yu Fa, go and take a look first.
Mr. Pao is out.
Throw him to death...
Sir, there is something wrong.
I see.
Let's go from the rear exit.
Uncle, it's safe, come out.
It's alright.
Let's go!
What's the matter?
Welcome, Bastard!
Is it for you?
Impossible.
I am not called "Bastard".
Throw him to death.
Take a look, it's pretty.
Come and buy vegetable.
Mister, buy some, it's fresh.
We have been safe.
No one recognises me.
Mr. Pao.
Deep fried Mr. Pao!
Deep fried Pao Lung Sing.
Pal, this is tried stinky beancurd.
How is it related to Pao Lung Sing?
That bastard!
He is as stink as this.
How can you talk like this?
Deep fried Pao Lung Sing.
Today's story is...
Pao was raped by few strong men.
This corrupted officer deserves to be raped...
Am I that disgusting?
Yau Wai, tell me, tell me the truth.
Sometimes, after starring at you for a while.
I do want to vomit.
But I think a little bit reservation is needed.
Pao was towed to the muddy pool, the muscular men fed him with shit, but he loved it.
He even enjoyed eating shit.
He said, "I can't stop eating!".
Did I do anything bad to you, thus you hate me that much?
Anyway, I am an official!
Although I am not very handsome.
But you needn't tease me like this.
I don't think everyone hates me that much.
Anybody likes me, hands up.
Go...
Well, you don't like to raise your hand, just forget it.
But you ran away, what does that mean?
Where are they going to?
To take weapon.
Throw him to death...
I think, they are against me only.
That's truth.
What a failure!
I make no money, and make everyone hate me.
I'd better educate the next generation.
Because the children will master the future.
If only they like me, I will have future.
Little friend.
You good boy, I love you, kid.
I can't imagine.
How can a kid spit so much.
Kidding?
How can that consumptive get married?
That's right.
Wonderful.
He is fighting in my territory, but he didn't inform me beforehand.
I'm Panther, the No.1 constable, I'm here to arrest the Notorious 10.
Whoever blocks my way, who will be killed with no mercy.
What's wrong with this sedan chair?
Son, go and pick your bride up.
What a waste!
Will her husband die suddenly tonight?
If he dies, then you will replace him?
I didn't say so, you said it.
Mr. Pao.
I am not Pal, mind your tongue, or I will report to the court.
You needn't deny,
I recognise you from your special smell.
Thank you for coming to our wedding party, I feel so proud of you.
Uncle, you are appreciated.
You have to thank God.
Old man, are you appreciating me?
If there is corrupted official, we, traffickers could make money easily.
So you are a trafficker!
Sir, please give me face, go in and join our party.
Alright, let's go.
- Remember to give us a red pocket.
- This way.
Please...
Give me a cheerful face.
It will be alright soon, it's almost done.
Old man, your son seems to be seriously sick.
He is fine.
Don't cough the lung out, pal.
It's okay!
What is it?
A piece of liver!
Pal, I don't need this for making hot pot.
I feel so comfortable.
It's finished, take a rest please.
Uncle, they are going to get married, stop dreaming.
What?
He may die during the wedding.
He even coughed out his liver.
Is that real liver?
What do you think?
Thank you!
Cousin Yuen Kwan, congratulations, you've a daughter-in-law now.
I am his step-mother only.
None of my business.
I know... you've kept a hand copy of Wahyim Sutra.
Could you let me have a look?
You go first.
How can you escape?
Panther, your sword is powerful,
- if you have guts, drop your sword.
- Alright!
Attack!
Panther, your hands are powerful, if you have guts, just fight with us without using your hands.
Alright.
Attack!
You have powerful feet.
If you have guts, fight with us without using hands, legs, and sword.
Alright!
His voice is really powerful.
Someone is killed, report to the court now.
I am an official.
How about me?
I am the first constable.
I am Lui Pao, nick named "Panther".
I've chased after these notorious robbers... for 7 days and nights.
You've kept them here.
Sir, I don't know what had happened.
Don't you know they were coming to your party?
Sir, my son's getting married.
I didn't know they had sneaked in.
Really?
Sir, I daren't cheat you.
Mr. Pao, don't you think so?
Mr. Pao, where have you been?
Mr. Pao...
Sir, he is paying no respect to us.
It's faceless to hide under the table.
Shut up, let's take a rest here, it's fine.
He seems to be powerful now,
I just let him be number one first.
Once he loses control, he will do something wrong, then I will go out to attack.
What's the matter?
I'm researching how to eat the roasted pig, why do you disturb me.
You are the official of this place, right?
Right, I am.
You must have linked with him to give those robbers protection.
And you wanted to rebel against the government, right?
He is as good as you at framing others.
Since we are of the same kind, let's share the money we are going to blackmail.
Maybe, I will take the bigger share.
I want all.
That's good.
What can I help you?
I tell you, my visit today, is being an undercover, to check whether you've committed crime.
Thank God.
We've discovered you.
You are the man behind of so many criminal cases.
Men, take him back.
Sir, none of my business, sir.
I am framed.
None of my business.
- Deal.
- Thank you!
They said they will give us 50 thousand taels within two hours.
Why not go back... and asked 2 girls to dine with us?
Just 2?
I want twenty!
Sir, please wait here.
I am going to check whether the girls have come or not.
They are coming.
Have they arrived?
Go and serve Mr. Panther, got me?
Sir.
You bastard, how dare you offend me?
You shit-head.
That bastard Mr. Pao has fallen into the hole.
Bastard, throw him to death...
- He deserves it.
- You are great Kung-fu master?
What are you doing?
Are you playing?
Have you listening to what I said?
How can you drop rats into it?
Mr. Panther, don't panic.
I will let a snake eat up all the rats.
Wait for me, Uncle.
Hurry up.
The banquet must have been finished.
I just want to eat the dessert only.
It's almost dawn, you will be lucky if they reserve an orange for you.
Your Honour...
I am not...
Your Honour, don't go.
We know that you are great.
You fixed that Panther... and saved Chi's family.
We represent Chi's family to welcome you.
Let's clap our hands to welcome Mr. Pao.
You are great!
Bravo!
Mr. Pao, would you say something to us?
Mind your tongue, say something decent.
Have you eaten the noodles yet?
Mr. Pao, we haven't eaten the roasted pig yet, we have reserved one for you.
Let's go.
Let's go for our dinner.
Thank you Sir, you are really wise.
You're welcome, take this as my gift.
Old man, haven't you eaten the roasted pig yet?
Kid, it's you again!
Do you want to spit again?
Stop it, or I will beat you up.
This is for you.
Great, Mr. Pao.
Thank you.
Treat you wife better, or I will lock you up.
And, take care.
Eat more liver, it's nutritious.
Go and enjoy your first night.
Go now, go...
I don't want to marry you.
I want to marry Mr. Pao.
Mr. Pao...
Siu Lin...
Great, Siu Lin...
Come here, Siu Lin.
Uncle, what are you doing?
Being started by the handsome men and pretty girls.
Go!
Be careful of fire.
"Pretend to have stomach ache.
Line up for a toilet."
- "Pretend to have stomach ache..."
- Help!
- What's the matter?
- Go.
Don't move.
Let me do it.
You'd better go.
Uncle, if you can't make it, let me take your place.
Damn it, how dare you hit me?
The Chi's family was killed...
Don't touch anything.
How dare you!
Bite, bite with all your strength.
I won't panic.
Uncle, stop playing with him.
Watch out.
None of my business.
Let go of me...
How dare you, do you know...
I know nothing.
Do you understand...
I know nothing.
- Bastard!
Men, prepare for punishment.
- Beat him.
Do you want to beat me?
How dare you beat me?
You are such a junior staff!
You know?
My dad is the Navy Commander, Sir Shang Kwan.
Is Navy Commander a senior post?
Much more senior then yours.
Brother Shang, have you eaten yet?
Brother Shang, do you want some tea?
How about the finest tea?
No way, I am a decent and honest official.
Shit, even the emperor commits the law.
- He should be perished.
- "Punished".
Just the same, if he were the son of the emperor!
Mrs. Chi, did he kill your family?
Yes, Sir!
My family, all together 13 people, were killed by him.
Please give a fair judgement.
What the hell is this?
Tell me now.
Sir!
Shang Wai is my mother-in-law's cousin.
He always visits our family.
On that night, since my hubby was sick.
I want to worship God to beg good luck for him.
Suddenly.
Someone covered my face with a handkerchief.
I could smell some medicine.
Then I fainted.
When I woke up,
I was...
I was raped by Shang Wai.
You beast!
Men!
Beat him 12738 times.
Stop!
I'd better do it myself.
Uncle, don't get mad, listen to her story first.
Alright, go on.
On that night...
You beast, you are inhuman...
Enough!
You were unconscious just then.
Why not make love again as a compensations to you?
Don't come over.
You asshole.
How dare you!
You've had secret affair with her!
Shut up!
Hands off me!
Shut up...
Shut up...
Yuen Kwan...
You bastard, you killed my wife.
I won't let you go, I want to report to the court.
Father!
I want to kill you, I want to kill you.
Don't be impulsive, listen to her story first.
Time reporter, what had happened?
I was reporting time.
Suddenly,
I heard Chi's dog barking madly.
So I want in and checked.
Suddenly, I saw dead bodies everywhere.
And I saw Shang Wai and Loi Fook fighting.
Later, I was kicked and I lost consciousness.
I saw nothing then.
Summon Loi Fook.
Did Shang Wai kill 13 people of Chi's family?
Yes...
He wanted to kill me too.
Don't panic, I am here to protect you.
Help, sir, please help me.
You said you would protect me.
He did give me face.
If I were not around, he would have bitten you to death.
Thank you Sir.
- Then, what happened?
- Lock him up temporarily, chop him after examining the bodies.
Lock him up first,
- chop him after examination of bodies.
- Yes.
You want to kill me?
I won't give it a damn.
I won't give it a damn.
What did you say...
You made a mistake.
Where is justice?
Mrs. Chi.
Don't worry, I will try my best.
To take revenge for your family.
Uncle, you've done a great job.
What's shinning?
It's the light from the gold, Sir.
It's you?
We work for our own masters in the court.
And I'd like... to compensate now.
What compensation?
As an old Chinese saying, there is golden house in the books.
If you do me a small favour, you needn't study, but get his golden house free.
Let's discuss it.
What do you mean?
Mister Shang Wai is the son of Sir Shang Kwan.
You have know it, right?
But, do you know that...
Mr. Shang is the buddy... of Eunuch Li.
Who is that?
Isn't he Li Lin-ying, the most powerful eunuch?
He is the right hand...
- of the Empress Dowager.
- You scared me.
These money... is sent buy Mr. Shang to you as present.
What the hell do you want?
Mr. Shang's mom is now 97 years old.
She loves Mr. Shang very much.
She heard the news about Mr. Shang.
She's been crying again and again.
Mr. Shang hopes you.
Mr. Pao, to let Mrs. Shang pay a visit to her grandson.
Sir, you'd better take an easily the rest.
Tomorrow, I will lead Mrs. Shang to leave the prison.
Why don't you just give a hand to such simple matters?
Are you bribing me?
Isn't it the practice of you?
I have been an honest and decent...
I won't be brided, I tell you.
- Have you ever heard of it?
- Yes!
But, just be considerate, she is so old.
Yeah, she is old, I have to respect her.
Filial duty is the first thing we Chinese should do.
I am a little bit tired.
- Yau Wai, lead them to the prison.
- Yes!
Wait!
When I wake up,
I want Shang Wai kneeling in the court, got me?
Sure... thank you Sir.
This way please.
She is almost a hundred's years old.
She just wants to see grandson, it's alright.
Let me go...
You know?
My dad is the Navy Commander.
My God-father is Eunuch Li.
I want to kill your family.
Don't chat so long, you know, you will make me feel difficult.
- Sorry for bothering.
- Thank you!
Who are you?
Your grandma is coming to visit you.
Grandma?
Dad...
Are you looking for death?
You have made a big trouble.
Dad, take me away.
Where can you go?
I am the Navy Commander.
Even you escaped, the government'd still request me to arrest you.
I disguise to visit you, it's a big risk you know?
If I am discovered, I would be in trouble.
- What'll I do?
I am scared.
- Don't worry.
I've employed Mr. Fong to defend for you.
Mr. Shang, you have to tell me every details.
Don't miss anything.
How is the case?
Can you help?
Luckily, it's 5 o'clock, we still have 4 hours to work.
What are we going to do?
To change white to black.
To change the accused to be the prosecutor.
Tomorrow, you have to remember...
Court...
Yau Wai...
What's the matter, Uncle?
I haven't got up yet, why you start the court?
Mr. Chan has come back early in the morning.
Mr. Chan.
Yes, he is the magistrate, you are the acting magistrate.
He's recovered, so he will be judge of this court.
You've had a sound sleep,
- so I didn't wake you up.
- Shit!
Uncle...
Sir.
Sir, this case has been...
Cut the crap, step aside.
- Step aside.
- Yes.
Uncle, sit here.
Damn it.
Mrs. Chi, you sue Shang Wai of killing your family.
Other than you, who has witnessed it?
Summon the coroner.
Sir, 13 people of Chi's family and a dog.
Their faces all turned to black.
I tested it with a silver needle, it turned black too.
I am sure that they were poisoned to death.
I discovered a pot of sweet soup.
It's mixed with arsenic.
How dare you!
Your family was poisoned to death.
Why did you claim they were beaten to death by Shang Wai?
You are framing him, aren't you?
Sir, I am framed.
Sir, I saw Shang Wai chasing after her servant...
Who saw Shang Wai chasing Loi Fook?
I saw it, the time reporter saw it too.
Time reporter?
Summon the time reporter.
Sir, I didn't see Shang Wai chasing after Loi Fook.
When I entered the Chi's garden, I saw Loi Fook... chasing after Shang Wai, Shang wanted to counter attack.
Later, I was kicked by Loi Fook, then fainted.
I didn't know anything at all.
This is not what you said last night, you...
I felt dizzy last night, so I couldn't tell every details.
Think before talking, such thing...
Shut up!
Summon the drugs store keeper Chu Yee.
Right, sir.
Yesterday at noon.
This woman came to my store to buy drugs.
She said there were rats in her house, so I sold her a catty of arsenic.
I didn't, Sir.
I didn't buy any arsenic in this store.
I always go there... to buy coughing herbs.
Who is it?
Sir, I am Fong Tong Kan, I want to sue someone.
He...
Who are you going to sue?
I represent Mr. Shang to sue...
Mrs. Chi who blackmailed My.
Shang.
She failed, thus she framed him of murdering.
I want to sue Mr. Pao, he is bribed and want to fame Mr. Shang.
Sir, I've heard that,
Mr. Pao has been bribed by Mrs. Chi with $30,000.
Now, his house is filled with money.
Really?
- Men, go check it.
- Yes!
Sir, we are trapped.
- No, I have to tidy up our place first.
- Freeze.
Sir, there is much money in Mr. Pao's place.
Pao, you are now temporarily suspended.
Until the truth has been discovered.
Mrs. Chi didn't give me money, he gave me money.
How dare you framing others now?
If your speak up again, I will beat you.
I...
Uncle, save it, they are allied.
Come on.
Just stay with me.
My God-son, I can't help you now.
And, I want to sue Mrs. Chi who killer her whole family.
Sir, I am framed.
Sharing Wai killed my family.
How are you miss up in court?
- Men beat her mouth.
- Yes!
I am framed.
Sir, how come the accused become the prosecutor?
You are fired.
If you don't keep your mouth shut, I will beat you to nuts.
Men, summon Shang Wai.
Sir!
Sir, I am Yiu's brother.
Last night!
I discovered the secret affair of Mrs. Chi and Loi Fook.
Mrs. Chi begged me not to disclose the secret.
And she asked me to discuss with her in her place.
I went to her place, she made some sweet soup.
But her family had all gone.
She wanted to treat me sweet soup.
You are lying...
- Beat her mouth again.
- Yes Sir.
Sir...
I suspected that, and I didn't drink it.
Later, I discovered her family were all dead.
Loi Fook rushed in to kill me, he asked his dog to bite me.
I am scared, and I rushed to the street, Loi Fook was after me.
Suddenly, he shouted for help.
I didn't know what kind of code is that,
Later, Mr. Pao and his men arrived, they arrested me.
You are lying...
Summon the gynecologist.
Sir...
I've checked...
Mrs. Chi.
On the day the tragedy happened, she was mated with someone.
And she is now pregnant.
That's right.
Her husband is having phthisis.
Doctor said he couldn't have son.
The public knows it.
Now she is pregnant, it proves her affair with Loi Fook.
Summon Loi Fook.
Sir!
How dare you seduce your master?
And you killed Chi's family, don't you know it's felony?
Sir, I did have secret affair with Mrs. Chi.
But I didn't poison Chi's family, she did it alone.
I didn't...
You are lying!
How can she fall for you?
Who will believe in you?
Show me evidence.
Mrs. Chi loves me, for she thinks that I am civilized, she sent me a poem.
I've brought it here, sir, let me read it out.
"Once we meet, I know we are two of a kind."
"Who cares how long can we stay, just enjoy our time".
Sir, please read this.
I am framed.
How dare you hook with your servant, and poisoned you family to death?
Now, all evidences are enough to prove you are guilty.
Are you going to admit it?
I am framed.
Give her punishment.
Sir, stop it, she can stand no more.
Uncle, stop arguing.
Sir, my ancestors and I have been officials for three generations.
I know pretty well that, traps are needed in politics.
But, you are going too far now.
You have no say here.
No...
Go on.
Mrs. Chi confessed.
Well, she will have her capital punishment after Autumn.
- Yes.
- Lock her up now.
Adjourn.
Sorry!
You bastard, you allied with them to set me up.
I won't let you go.
Snow!
It's snowing.
Snow in June.
It's a set up.
Come and have judgement again...
- Uncle...
- It's a set up.
The house is empty, where can we get the evidence?
Are you expecting the evidence is put on the table?
You should discover is yourself.
Bravo.
A tough dog.
Isn't it the dog of Chi?
Bill!
How do you know that?
Who wrote it?
I remembered, you asked them not to move the evidence, and you wanted them to label it.
God is helping me.
Show me its head.
Turn it!
Not poisoned?
Obviously, its neck was broken.
It's killed.
Why were they found poisoned?
I have to check the bodies.
It's felony to interrupt the dead bodies.
Oh, the head is connected by needles.
If the needle is pulled, the body will be separated.
He was beaten to death.
But the needle turns black.
It proves that, there is poisoned substance inside their throats.
Hurry up, it stinks.
I have to check another body.
Try stabbing into the stomach.
If they are poisoned, the needle will turn black too.
It isn't, there is no poisoned substance inside his stomach.
But there is poison in the throat?
I guess, they were beaten to death.
Then, the poison was poured into their throat.
So, the poison could never reach the stomach.
Right!
I've got it.
Bingo!
I've got it.
Bravo.
Sir, why are you here?
I am coming to arrest you.
Do you want to destroy the evidence?
You will be put in jail.
Mr. Chan.
Mr. Shang.
Well done.
You are very wise.
You know they will come back to look for evidence.
Set a fire and destroy everything.
Yes Sir.
And, uproot the trouble.
Ask someone to go to the prison and...
Pal, please tell my senior, how about let me change... to be stained waitress...
You nuts.
Your nephew is smarter than you, he is the stained waitress.
He is going to against you.
He is now staying home and having soup.
- You deserve it.
- What id you say?
You corrupted official.
You deserve to be put it jail.
I am not in good mood, cut the crap.
I won't give you face.
So what?
Come and fight with me if you have guts.
Don't push me, I will beat you.
You bastard, you should stay with that bitch.
Which bitch?
What did you say?
Repeat.
That's Mrs. Chi.
She is right behind you.
You mean behind this wall?
Yeah.
You should have told me earlier.
Mrs. Chi, I am Pao Lung Sing.
Where are you?
Save you crocodile's tears.
Just charge me anything you want.
In fact, I do want to go to heaven to stay with my husband.
What a pity that,
I am having his baby.
Is that consumptive's blood?
No, I mean you husband?
My husband has got a hereditary nostrum.
He took medicine regularly, he had almost recovered.
And he got the reproductive ability too.
So great.
Why don't you come here?
So you could torture me.
You misunderstood.
Look at me.
In order to fight for justice for you.
I was dragged down too.
I misunderstand you, I am sorry.
It doesn't matter, I wish I could go out.
And you will let me copy your hereditary nostrum.
However,
I think they will kill me this time.
Sir, I am sorry.
Please don't say that.
Mrs. Chi, please give me your finger.
I don't think there is no justice at all.
I promise, once I am alive.
I will try my beat to save you.
Thank you Mr. Pao.
Uncle...
- You bastard.
- Cut the crap.
- You are sentenced to death.
- Death?
They said you allied with notorious robbers.
Smuggling arms.
Pushed an old lady to the sea.
And raped a pig.
Never, I didn't rape a pig.
Anyway, they wanted to frame you.
You will be dead meat.
I've discussed with grandpa.
Before your death, we want you to leave a descendant.
So, we've got you a virgin.
- I want that too.
- You will be the next.
Cut the crap, go in and reproduce.
Yu Fa, hurry up.
It's you.
Of course.
Don't waste time, hurry up.
Yau Wai, mask me please.
You needn't be masked, but I have a new method. "Incredible Stance!"
Yu Fa, you are incredible!
Cut the crap, let's go now.
Mrs. Chi, don't worry,
I will come back to save you.
Go.
Sir, I wish you to be safe.
Lucky forever.
Son, I am glad you are back.
Great, you have got you memory.
Mom.
Son, it's great to see you.
Your dad is seriously sick.
Are you alright?
I am glad you are rescued.
I am useless, I lost you face.
How come?
It's you who is not as vicious as them.
A corrupted should be vicious.
A decent official should be more vicious.
Or, how can you cope with those bastards?
Son, go to the capital to sue them.
I do want to do so.
I have half cake.
I've kept this for 20 years, you'd better make good use of it.
What is it?
The Judicial Secretary is... my best friend.
Once he was almost starved to death.
I had a cake, I just gave him all.
Late, he returned half to me.
He said, when he got rich, if my descendants took this cake to him.
He would try his best to help us.
But I am afraid I couldn't compete with them.
How come?
We are from the Pao's family.
In Sung Dynasty, our ancestor Pao Ching...
- The Great Judge?
- Yeah, that's him.
He wrote this sacred scroll.
I've learnt everything.
Why don't you tell me earlier?
Where is it now?
It's under the table.
But I can't read such letters!
This is ancient letters.
You didn't study hard, that's why you don't know.
Ask someone to teach you.
I know it, dad.
What else do you have?
We have a Royal Sword.
It is sent by the Emperor, take this to the capital.
Where is it now?
Take it.
This is authorised to kill the corrupted king and vicious officials.
Take it.
Yau Wai, keep the sword.
Dad.
I just want to...
What's wrong with you?
Do you want to set me free so as to kill Pao Lung Sing?
You are nasty too.
I will kill him into pieces.
Yau Wai, mom does give us some gold.
Why do you carry so many carrots?
That's the gold which Grand-mom mentioned.
I think these carrots are enough for us to go to the capital.
Uncle, there is something over there.
That idiot seems to be you.
No, he isn't like that.
Thank God.
Uncle, is this the look you've just made?
It seems to be very dangerous.
We passed.
That's him.
Don't go.
Run!
Don't go!
Hurry up, it's getting dark.
Hurry up, let's go on board.
Untie the boat.
Don' go, bastard!
Don't chase after me.
Wait for me.
A girl.
Why did you risk so much?
Someone wants to kill me, so I should run for my life.
Don't go.
You can never escape.
Bastard!
Don't go, bastard.
Who is he calling?
He is greeting me as Betty.
Betty?
Thank you for your help.
May I know your name?
Stone Mansion.
- And you.
- Stone Talk.
Don't mention and don't talk?
- Stone Mansion.
- Stone Talk.
Forget it.
Why did the guy chase after you?
I know it...
He wanted to rape her, so...
Nuts, he is a man.
Don't panic,
I will be the boss, I will help you to calm down.
Come on, eat now.
Miss Stone, are you going to the capital?
Yes, we are.
But we won't go into the capital.
- Come on, help yourself.
- Sure.
Why not go there together, so we can take care of each other.
Ask brother.
But you have to help us in the show.
I know nothing.
You may take a lesson.
What?
Come and eat some food, come on.
Take this.
Come on.
Bravo!
Underwear.
Ying, where are you going?
I don't want to bother you, since I know you are not happy with me.
I'd better leave.
Where are you going?
I don't know, just go anywhere.
You'd better get a shelter here.
- If you stay, I will take care of you.
- Thank you.
I won't reject your hospitality.
You are nasty.
I...
Damn it, just a small trick!
Now, I have got free accommodation and meal.
What a coincidence?
How did you come in?
There is a hole.
That's the hole for the rat.
I know how to shrink my body.
Wonderful!
Cut the crap, the inn is full.
I am afraid we have to sleep in the same bed.
How come?
We are men,
- unless you are...
- I am not.
So, come on.
Ying, come out now.
I am coming.
What's the matter?
- Your relative wants to see you.
- My relative?
I've found you at last.
Shut up, I don't want to see you, get lost.
- I don't...
- Shut up.
- I don't...
- Shut up!
Why don't you let me greet you?
Miss Betty.
You are so smart!
If I were smart, I wouldn't have been beaten.
You almost discovered my secret.
What?
Miss Betty.
They are so kind to let you stay, why do you cheat them?
Sorry, she is a girl.
- She is called Betty at home.
- Dad!
You are a woman?
!
You know, it's not convenient for a girl to fool around.
So she dressed like this.
Girl, say sorry to them.
Go.
Oh, you're your brother's sister... and you're your sister's brother too!
Please don't tease me.
Miss Betty, would you please come over?
Stop bothering.
I want to tell you something about Uncle Sing.
I will be right back.
I've checked, this circus is going to the capital.
We just have two carrots, how can we afford going North?
Let's follow them to the capital!
You needn't teach me.
Brother, you can't do that to her!
She is a girl.
I don't know it at all.
So, you know it now?
Ying!
Sleep with me tonight.
Great!
Wait, I daren't sleep together, I am afraid of darkness.
No problem, I will accompany you.
What a beautiful moon.
It won't be beautiful soon, come and sleep.
Have you chatted with others on the roof top?
I hate this most.
I forgot which old man told me.
When the moon is most pretty, tell her your wish, then your wish will come true.
Have you ever made a wish to the moon?
How about you?
I made a wish, I want to be a decent official.
Until now, I know it's hard to be a decent official.
But I am between decent and nasty.
I achieved nothing.
I've heard the muscular man... scolded our as bastard,
who are you?
- My surname is Pao.
- Are you Pao Lung Sing?
Do you know me?
All the people in nearby provinces know you!
You were fired in order to fight for justice for a woman.
You courage is praised.
In fact I am not.
I daren't look down.
To my mind, you are the most courageous hero.
Since you force me, I have to admit.
Since I love low profile.
And, please don't report to the court.
I may sleep outside.
If you don't sleep with me, your identity will be easily disclosed.
You'd better take care.
Think of me any time.
You've to wear more clothes when you are doing shows.
Remember, think of me, got me?
- Don't court girls.
- Don't seduce man.
Don't worry, I won't.
When will we meet again?
Next year, we will meet in Spring when the flowers blossom.
Take care.
- Is this your cake?
- Yes!
I am glad to see you, how is your dad?
He has just passed away.
Why kind hearted people don't have long life?
Be frank,
I come a long way here to meet you,
I just want to help me to sue someone in front of the Emperor.
What is it about?
I was an official.
But a rich guy hooked with a corrupted official...
Stop it!
Damn it!
I hate such kind of people most.
Uncle, I am so glad to meet you.
Tell me, who is that guy?
I will fight for justice for you by all means.
He is called Shang Wai.
His dad is that bastard Shang Kwan, the Navy Commander.
Your Excellency, what do you think?
What's your idea?
I wish I could chop their heads off.
And use their heads to clean my ass.
Uncle, let it clean mine too.
After cleaning your ass, return it to me, I will clean mine again.
Old man, do you have interest to clean yours with their heads?
I will lend it to you.
Do I have a shave?
Uncle, may I know your name?
I am Shang Kwan!
It's a trap!
I won't give it a damn!
Your Excellency, it's so decent of you that,
- this guy...
- Save your breath.
- What?
- Save your breath!
Go now.
The officials are protecting each other.
My dad helped you once.
Even you don't help me, you should give me some advantage.
May be, pay me a million or something.
You dad just gave me a tasteless cake.
I could just repay you a cake.
But I am kind enough to pay you 100 times of it.
You really have guts.
Yau Wai, let's go.
Freeze, you needn't hurry.
Why not eat the cake first?
Men, feed them with cakes.
Come on, open you mouth.
Swallow it...
How dare you!
Even the Emperor could do nothing to me.
Why not kill them?
No, I want them to stay in the capital to be beggars!
So as to lose his dad's face.
Yau Wai, how are you?
Are you alright?
I feel a little bit hungry.
- Thank you for you help.
- You are welcome.
Daughter-in-law, come and thank his Excellency.
- Thank you...
- You're welcome...
When will you give birth to the baby?
Next month,
- you have to join this birthday party.
- Sure...
Get away...
Come on, buy some incense.
You will be blessed.
Miss, come and buy some incense, come on.
Do you want to sell incense?
Uncle, we have been driven to a dead end.
We will have some way out.
I know, but we haven't eaten for days.
Thank you...
Pal, but I am an official.
Free buns!
Miss, please give me one, one more please.
I haven't eaten for days.
Yau Wai, don't take those buns.
If you take it, you will become a beggar at once.
I prefer being a beggar, forget about me.
- Listen to me please.
- Don't block my way.
Someone is distributing money.
Yau Wai.
If I am used to be a beggar, I could never be an official again.
I won't be a beggar!
How dare you cheat for meal in our place?
Go to hell.
Go to hell...
Pal, you cheat for a free lunch?
So what?
I'm going to some place else.
Right, I'd like to be a cheater.
Come again when you have time.
Mister, I can tell from your face that, you must be a visitor.
I can tell you must be rich.
Fung, Chun, come and serve our VIP tea.
Come on, have some tea.
You don't like it?
Come to our VIP room then.
I will serve you with the best dishes, come on.
Mister, don't hurry, take care.
Eat some more fish, come on.
Are you full?
Well, have some wine.
- Come on, this is my toast.
- Stop bothering me.
Come on, drink it.
No one cares only eating in a prostitute house!
- Nuts!
- No, he isn't nuts.
He's good taste, he is not interested in such ordinary girls.
I've to serve him with our treasure...
Yu Yin.
Let's go out...
You...
Don't care who I am.
It's fate for us... to know each other now.
I...
Shut up, let's close our eyes, to guess the character of each other, say identity and interest.
One two three.
You are a woman.
You are a decent woman, you don't care about money.
And...
Guess what I am.
I don't know your past.
But, later...
You will become a handicapped person.
You haven't a penny, how dare you come to our place?
Don't come over.
Or, I will stab her eyes.
How dare you visit a prostitute house without money?
No money but have great meal?
!
And order girls to accompany you.
I will cut your balls out.
How dare you?
Have you seen it?
This is the correct way to beat him.
No money at all?
Just some cheap clothes?
Damn it.
Just one old book!
Don't touch my book...
Don't burn my book.
You can't damage it.
Don't!
- It's over.
- From this day onward, you have to be gigolo for three months.
Clean it, work hard.
Poor the water.
How poor is he, he can't shut up his mouth.
How can he eat?
Ask your mistress out.
Or.
I will scold her family as well.
What's the matter?
Your girls have taken all my customers, what do you think?
The clients pay whoever they like, it's not our fault.
No way, I want you to repay my loss, give me tea and say sorry.
Otherwise, I will teach you good lesson.
Do you want to quarrel with me?
Your son has no ass, your dad is a gigolo.
You have broken ass, you love eating chicken ass.
Big ass, how can you blame me for your poor business?
- Let me scold you...
- No, I will tell you my story first.
My dad died when I was three, when I was 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, my dad died too.
I started to seduce man early at 10,
I slept with your man too.
- How dare you, old bluffer!
- If you've guts to show me your man,
I'll have the guts to court him.
I want to squeeze you to death.
You have guts to squeeze me, I have guts to enjoy it.
I...
Damn you.
What is this word?
- Isn't it "Smart"?
- It's "Smart"...
Damn it, it's "Shame", don't you feel shame?
You started to seduce man at 7, now you are 40 something.
Don't you feel shame?
You'd better go to hell.
What have you achieved in your life?
I've trained 4 famous hookers, they are the top ones in the capital.
Right, but they are now under me.
Haven't they told you?
You are old and you have no money.
Even your girls left you, you should suicide.
You are stupid, even you become a ghost, you'll be a stupid ghost.
You will become a shit-head in your next life.
- What does that mean?
- Shit-head!
Do you want to quarrel with me?
Got lost!
Wonderful.
- I love you.
- Good.
Go to hell!
- What are you doing?
- Don't ask me.
Don't you feel it?
Close your eyes first.
You still want to fool me like this?
I was terribly beaten.
I won't beat you,
I just want to chat with someone.
Why?
I feel lonely, and I feel cold.
Is it that serious?
I always face those bastards,
I can't make friends with them.
- I am bastard too.
- No, you are not that bad.
That's right.
Hold me.
Do you need that?
I won't fool you.
I just want a man who is not so disgusting to give me warmth.
No way?
Just take this as charity.
Alright.
Be frank, you have to give me a red pocket.
Bastard, how dare you court my girl?
- Do you want to quarrel with me?
- I don't want to quarrel with you.
I pay you living, how dare you court my girl?
You heartless man.
She said it's boring to be hooker, she is bored.
She just wants me to comfort her.
You are hooker, and is an old hooker.
Have you ever felt Lonely and cold?
Yes.
None of your business.
None of my business?
I'm working in a prostitute house, I don't want you to have happy life.
If you are not in good mood, you will treat the clients badly.
No clients come and we will close.
If we closed, I've to sleep on the road.
Isn't it my business?
How dare you answer back?
You will suffer!
Before my death, I will pack up your bones for you.
Your son will have no ass.
You mean your son?
How long can you be that cocky?
Until you die.
- I...
- You are beautiful if you don't make up.
You will live happily if you die.
- You...
- I will drive you mad anyway.
If I were a ghost, I would have scared you to death.
How come this guy is so powerful... in quarrelling?
- Are you alright?
- Get lost!
Kid, don't go if you have guts.
I will look for help and quarrel with you.
I am waiting.
- You...
- Damn...
We heard you had a terrible quarrel with Auntie San?
She even twisted her lips.
It was no big deal.
You're the "Sharp Tongue" in the brothel now.
Someone comes to challenge us again.
- How dare you!
- Let me handle it.
I'm working now.
If Yu Yin doesn't come to serve me tonight.
I'll turn this place over to find the criminal.
Impossible.
She doesn't sell her body.
I won't pay, that's okay.
- What are you doing?
- Panther is here!
Hide up.
There's a pond over there.
Sir.
Sir, don't to this.
I'll shout for help.
Go ahead!
Nobody will hear you.
Help...
Beast!
Could you stop now.
The Duke is here.
He wants Yu Yin too.
- Really?
- Yes, he brought a pate young man with him.
There's someone.
Duke!
So this is Yu Yin.
No...
Kidding, she is so pretty, but you said "No"?
No wonder, she is the number one here.
Brother...
Have a chat.
Come with me.
Yes, take you time.
Don't do this.
I'm going to scream.
Go ahead!
It's useless.
Beast!
There's a guest with Yu Yin.
Damn!
I'm the Secretary for home Affair, who is going to stop me?
- Please, Secretary for home Affair.
- Get lost.
He's here?
If he catches me here, he'll tell the queen,
I'll be in deep shit.
It's a pond out there.
Under the bed.
Please don't go in...
How dare you lie to me?
There's no one here.
You can have a bridge party now.
Can you handle it?
Don't worry.
Nice to meet you.
- What's your name?
- Ai-Shin-Chue-Luo.
Stop it!
Or I'll scream.
Go ahead.
It's useless.
How come men are all like this?
I'm getting bored.
Beast!
Have you ever played the "animal chess"?
Elephant eats tiger, tiger eats cat, cat eats rat, rat eats elephant!
Rat, you know what to do?
Who is it?
Sir, a great hero like you indeed acts bravely in bed, too.
I'm here to learn your skill.
Bastard!
Get out!
Sure, but I have a big mouth.
I just don't know how to keep secrets.
So hundreds people might come to admire you like I do.
They'll be you cheering team.
Here's the money!
Get out.
I pay you, do it quickly.
I...
It's either you or me to leave.
You go!
Alright, you go...
- Help...
- What's the matter?
You arranged some audiences here?
Like what I did.
Come out.
Who are they?
They're the professionals who do talk shows.
They will tell... a new story about you.
I'm sure... the audiences will love it.
Just forget me.
Only one?
We've four.
Alright, three more.
Thank you.
You were great!
Take it!
You are pretty smart.
You Majesty.
How do you know that?
Forgive me please.
I found your royal underwear.
Please forgive me.
Maybe it was dropped for I am being scared.
Your Majesty.
It's a secret that.
I came to the brothel.
Whoever tells,
I'll kill all his family.
Your Majesty, I have to ask for a favor.
If you don't help me, I'll tell the secret.
I'd rather get killed.
How dare you threaten me?
Why do you have so much interest in observing the plants today?
I observed the weather... to be quite abnormal lately.
I guess, there must be some misjustice.
Your Majesty, everyone is having a happy and stable life.
Is it?
Then why would someone file a lawsuit?
Some villains are too bored with their life.
Set up, it must be a set up.
But Pao seems... to be decent.
Pao looks like a rat.
His father was well known for his corruption.
Like father, like son.
- He is corrupted too.
- Right...
- Is he that bad?
- Sure!
He came here to sue someone before?
Summon Pao Lung Sing.
- You Majesty.
- Rise.
Did he come to sue someone?
Yes, Your Majesty.
He took bribes... and tried to frame my son.
But his boss was smart enough to fire him.
He's still... a wanted criminal.
How did Your Majesty get to know him?
I have people bringing me news from everywhere.
According to my information.
He even work as a pimp in a brothel.
I'm sure Your Majesty won't trust a pimp's words.
- Unless you've been...
- Bastard!
How could an Emperor visit there?
Yes...
I've never been a pimp.
I hide up to study.
I want to return to fight for justice.
You're never been a pimp?
Bring Auntie San.
Luckily I've got the secret information.
He would be dead meat.
This woman is the owner of that brothel!
She'll identify Pao.
Yes, sir.
Is he the pimp of your brothel?
No!
I've never met him.
What's wrong?
You've never seen pretty girls?
Step aside.
If he's not a pimp, I can trust his words now.
Tell us about your case.
I used to be an alternate judge.
But I was bullied by my boss, Chan Pak Cheung.
Who framed a poor woman.
She was pregnant and yet she was sentenced to death.
I need a fair trial.
He's lying, anyway, he's a criminal.
What was his crime?
He tried to interrupt dead bodies.
No, I tried to investigate the real cause of victims' death.
Because the death was suspicious.
You both sound right.
What should I do?
Let's make a bet.
Here's an apple.
If you can stab into it with this dagger.
I'll let the case retrial.
Please think about it.
If you miss, you'll be killed.
Your Majesty, stop considering.
It's difficult to make it if we put it on the table.
Let's put it on my head.
Take care, You Majesty.
Take care of yourself.
You're really...
Loyal to me.
I'll let you replace my position to hold the apple.
Go ahead!
Ready?
Okay!
Your Majesty,
I'd like to have my eyes covered first.
You used to do it like this?
No, but the blood will make me sick.
Alright.
Come on!
I think the victim must be framed.
The case should go to court again.
I don't mean to force you.
Not at all.
Justice comes first.
Pao, come forward.
You're now appointed the supreme Judge.
You'll go with the Secretary and the Navy Commander.
To re-trial the case.
Panther, you'll guard Pao's life forever.
You're appointed as "Great Kung Fu Master".
Go now with Pao.
Thanks, You Majesty.
What rank is the Supreme Judge?
First.
Great!
Your Majesty, thanks very much.
I've tried my best, you should treat me out.
Let's go to the brothel.
Great!
It's time.
Chop.
Please forgive her.
Don't listen to him.
Chop.
Decree from the Majesty.
Stop chopping.
Take the criminal under custody.
Wait until Supreme Judge come and rejudge.
Mr. Pao.
"Fair and Justice"
Mr. Pao wants to prove Ms. Chi's innocence.
Go and give him a hand.
Dad, I will re-establish our reputation today.
What's wrong?
How come your face is so black?
Uncle wants to be tanned so as to look like Pao Ching.
Is that your idea?
Uncle, how come you're not tanned?
I had a mask with me.
I just need this mark.
How come you're so tanned?
I was trapped.
The murder case of the Chi's family, will be re-trailed by, three departments.
The most superior judge would be Pao Lung Sing.
And the Secretary of the judicial Department, Mr. Fa.
The Navy Commander, Mr. Shang and me.
Keep silence in court.
Today, no one's allowed to speak foul language.
You can't curse at each other's parents or mention any sex organ.
I should be granted special rights.
Alright, you can curse at other's mother only.
Damn your mother.
Uncle, you'll win for sure.
Dessert.
He's nothing special, except he uses a bigger desk.
We'll find a way to fight him.
Have a sip.
Don't worry.
Eunuch Lee supports us.
Try our best to beat him.
You'll get him.
- Your...
- What?
- Your Honour.
- What's wrong?
You shouldn't say so.
You shouldn't stare at me.
- What?
- You stared at me.
You stared at me first, so you knew I was staring at you.
I can call you slut, but you can't stare at me.
How dare you call me slut?
I'll report to His Majesty.
Slut...
You can't do this.
He's appointed by his Majesty.
Damn you mother.
You can't curse in court...
Damn you mother.
There's nothing to do with any mother.
Damn you mom.
You are slut!
I'm here to re-trial the case.
I did not ask you to speak yet.
You're tried to offend the Supreme Judge!
Tell me, are you slut?
You can't leave.
You claim yourself great?
Why did you step out?
What's your problem?
Do you want to play some tricks?
I came with other people for fun.
I just step out a bit.
Alright, I will step back.
Cut the crap, step back...
Stand behind the yellow line...
Stand...
So what?
So what?
Shit, I step forward again.
Shit, I step back again.
So what?
So what?
Are you going to beat me?
Alright!
You all heard... that he asked for it.
I've never seen any request like this.
Sir, we should question Chi first.
Mrs. Chi, what do you have to say?
We'll be fair.
Sir, it's all under you control.
My family was murdered, by Shang Wai,
and I was raped by him, too.
Summon Shang Wai.
Your Honours.
How did... her family die?
She killed them.
Summon the drugs store keeper and the coroner.
Your Honour.
Mr. Chu, from you last statement,
Mrs. Chi bought arsenic in you store, right?
Yes, Your Honour.
Coroner, and you testified that the dessert was poisoned, right?
Yes, Your Honour.
Look, here's some sugar and poison.
If we pour them in, it'll be too sticky.
Do you think anyone would want to eat this?
Maybe, the Chi's family was too stupid.
Would you like to try some?
It's wonderful, drink it, then you can fly.
Help...
You're stupid too, even you are not willing to drink it.
Don't you think the dead would be smarter than you?
Maybe she didn't use all those arsenic.
So where did the rest go?
I've searched all over didn't see any.
If she didn't need that much.
Why would she buy that much?
So the truth is... you lied!
I didn't lie, Your Honour.
Really?
We stole this account book from you.
Not many people buy arsenic.
And you only ordered half a catty of arsenic.
And yet and said you sold her a catty?
- Sir, I have a very bad memory.
- Bad Memory?
How about a few months ago... when you testified?
You always have poor memory.
- Great Kung-fu Master.
- Yes, Sir.
I asked you to examine the bodies, and what was the result?
Please turn around.
Your Honour, look.
Only the throats... turned black.
According to my experience.
Some one must have poured poisonous substance into their mouths.
So the poison didn't reach the stomach.
Every bodies had a serious fracture.
Their heads were put back together with nails.
I think the murderer must be an great master in Kung-fu.
Later, someone wanted to cover it.
Shang Wai, did you hear it?
Sir, I have something to say.
He just said... the killer knows Kung-fu.
Well.
But Mr. Shang doesn't know any Kung-fu.
So, how can you prove him to be the murderer?
Then why did we... arrest him in great effort?
I'm born to be strong.
Really?
Serve him with great punishment.
Yes.
If you don't resist, you'll suffer from the penalties.
If you resist, it means you know Kung-fu.
Eunuch Lee arrives.
God-father.
- Your Excellency.
- Buddy.
I come to hear... the trial.
I brought something for Wai, my God-son.
God-father.
Behave yourself.
If you commit any crime,
I'll punish you, too.
But if anyone wants to frame you.
I'll back you up.
Of course...
This is from the queen.
If you wear it, nobody is allowed to hit you, except the Emperor.
No one is allowed to hurt you.
Your Honour...
Uncle, we can't beat him, what'll we do?
How wise is he!
Maybe they were not... poisoned to death.
But Chi might have hired a killer to murder them.
The time reporter also saw Wai being beaten up, too.
We should punish Chi to make her confess.
Prepare the penalty.
You're so smart.
I admire your flattering ability.
Mr. Pao, what do you mean?
Nothing serious,
I'll say something else...
- You...
- Don't mention my mom.
Who mentioned to punish Chi?
Mr. Pao, you don't have to distract our attention.
- Prepare for the punishment.
- Yes.
Wait a moment.
Who is going to give order?
What?
Mr. Pao, you're very bureaucratic.
If we let you get promoted in future, you won't even respect the Empress Dowager.
Respect has a different meaning to me.
I respect His Highness from the bottom of my heart.
Unlike you who always talks... but not really respect her.
- You...
- You were not filial... to your mother, by becoming an eunuch.
You're not loyal because you don't respect the Empress Dowager.
So what would a damn sissy... guy sitting here for?
How dare you talk like this?
I'm the Supreme judge.
You're just a housekeeper... of the royal family.
I'm standing, how dare you sit there?
I must teach you about manners.
Okay, I'll report to His Majesty, and kill your...
Damn you father.
Go ahead if you think you can walk out of here.
Shut the door!
Release the dogs.
Mr. Pao...
I can handle this by myself.
Let's come back to the trial.
Alright.
Asshole.
- Who do you mean?
- Whoever answers me.
You bastard.
I'll ignore you.
You're maniac.
Damn you.
Go to hell...
Sissy asshole.
Your Honour.
Mr. Pao is dragging time, let's go threatening the witness.
- Go.
- Yes.
Isn't that the coroner?
How come he's beaten up like this?
He made a false testimony.
He took bribery and he framed that victim.
So Pao beated him up like this.
The drugs store keeper Chu Yee, was cut into two halves by Pao.
It hurts.
Help...
What are you doing?
It hurts.
I can't walk.
I can't move.
- Don't tell lies.
- Don't come close.
It hurts... help...
What are you doing?
Go away, help...
What are you doing down there?
I want to write the word "miserable".
I can't read.
Don't bother me.
I'm over.
It's your turn.
You have a rat face, eagle nose, elephant ears... yellow teeth, pig legs, big mouth... beary waist, and chicken chest.
If I were you, I would have committed suicide already.
- I...
- You took off your pants before sleep.
The marks of ass are all over your body.
Damn you...
Your Excellency, are you alright?
Come and take a seat.
Go to hell!
Why don't you punish her?
You've messed up for ages.
Are you delaying on purpose?
Of course not.
Go on.
Summon Loi Fook and the gynecologist.
Your Honour, we're willing to tell the truth.
One by one, let's question Mrs. Chi first.
It's not your turn yet.
Punish Chi first.
- I feel great pain.
- Are you pretending?
It hurts.
My baby is coming out.
She's acting.
Let's just go ahead to punish her.
Come on.
Wait, let's ask the gynecologist's opinion.
She'll know it after a check.
It hurts.
Sir, her baby is coming out.
What would you say?
I'm not the judge.
You'll decide it.
Let's vote.
If you think she should be punished now, hands up.
- Three to one!
Punish her!
- No way.
Everybody can vote here.
Hands up if you think she should have her baby laboured first.
Let her give birth...
Let her give birth...
Let her give birth...
What would you say?
We can't offend the public.
Let her have her baby laboured first.
Alright, Chi is permitted to have her baby laboured first.
- Be careful.
- It hurts...
There was something wrong with your testimony.
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth.
What did you really see on that day?
I...
I saw Shang Wai beating Loi Fook.
So the dog attacked Shang Wai.
But Shang kicked the dog to death.
Loi Fook got away and I tried to escape, too.
But Shang kicked me hard, and I fainted.
Why didn't you say this last time?
Because Mr. Fong gave me... 500 taels to make a false testimony.
Your Honour, please don't kill me.
Mind your tongue.
You mean everybody is lying?
Loi Fook, what did you see on that night?
I forgot.
Did you commit adultery with Chi?
Did she ask you to murder the whole family?
No, I only had affair with her.
You said Chi was very fond of you.
- She even wrote you a love poem, right?
- Yes!
Bring him the love poem.
Could you read it once again?
We are two of a kind.
Our love will last forever.
There're few words missing, right?
The is another poem, idiot.
What character is this?
Damn it.
You can't even read the word "Dead"!
Kill him.
How dare you frame her up?
Men, kill him now.
No, Your Honour, I am framed.
Fong gave me 5,000 tales... so as to frame Chi.
I still have 3,000 taels at home.
Bastard.
How dare you to betray me?
You did commit adultery.
Kill me, sir.
I have evidence.
I can't never have any affair with Chi.
I'll show you.
Show us them.
I was born in a poor family, so I castrated myself.
I wanted to be an eunuch, but I didn't have money to bribe the eunuch, so I failed.
Then I went to work for the Chi's family.
So I can't have any sex.
Another damn eunuch.
I don't mean you.
Alright.
Let's dismiss Fong's title first.
Then we'll trial him later.
What do you think?
Sure, whatever you say.
Fong!
You'd better tell the truth.
I'll consider a slight punishment if you turn to be stained witness.
Fong and Loi Fook are guilty of bribery, so they should be chopped to death.
You're so vicious.
How are you.
Slap him.
Uncle, they were seriously hurt.
So we don't have any witness now.
My son, I've brought the Royal Sword to you.
Mom, you...
Grandma, stop playing, we are busy.
Take the salted fish away.
This is not salted fish, it's real.
Royal Sword?
Uncle, make sure of it, may be...
It's really a Royal Sword.
Shang Wai, don't you think I couldn't beat you up?
In front of me, you could never tell lies.
I will chop your fingers off with my Sword.
Are you going to confess now?
Asshole, get lost.
My Sword is authorised to kill corrupted king and nasty official.
I don't want to hurt you.
Since the reign of Ching Dynasty,
I've never heard of Royal Sword.
What is this?
This is not common stuff, you don't know it of course.
Grandma, tell them!
Which Emperor granted this to our family?
This is granted by Emperor Sung-ching of Ming Dynasty.
Ming Dynasty?
You used Ming's sword to chop the official of Ching Dynasty?
You mean a rebellion?
In fact... the atmosphere is too tense, my mom and I just want to do something... to give you fun.
Don't you mind this?
If you swallow it, I will take this as fun.
Well, I will do it.
Thank you...
Now, it's alright.
Back to the trial.
Forget the things just happened.
If you don't show any evidence to accuse Shang Wai, you have to adjourn.
Then Wai will be a coquetted.
Hey, the baby is born, congratulations.
Stop messing up, decide it now.
Well, we have no choice but... test it with blood.
Blood test?
Right!
Scare him first!
Shang Wai you said you didn't rape the accused.
So her baby must have nothing to do with you.
So, your blood can't be matched with its blood.
If you take the blood test, you've chance to proof you're innocent.
If you don't take the test, you must be the murderer.
Go ahead.
I scare nothing.
It's matched, you must be the murderer.
You'd have raped her and then killed her family.
You'd not deny.
Men, prepare the guillotine.
Impossible...
God-father, the kid is not mine.
It is not mine.
God-father...
- I am here, don't panic.
- You have to help me...
If you were not the adulator, why the blood matches each other?
That must be your kid, you can never explain.
He is not my kid.
I screwed her that night, how can she get pregnant on the next day?
Oh, you screwed her!
You beast, how dare you cheat me?
Are you happy?
Here is the truth.
I won't take care of you.
Please give way.
Mister, how are you?
Honey, why are you here?
It's you and father-in-law who asked me to come.
That's my son?
You mean, he is my son?
You bastard!
How dare you trick me?
So what?
Stop talking to him.
Shut the door and let the dogs out.
I won't care about you, I am leaving.
God-father...
Don't come over.
Bastard, do you want to rebel?
You said you didn't know Kung-fu, now you confess again.
Stand back.
I'll kill him.
Eunuch Li, thank you for sacrificing yourself.
I will report to His Majesty and give you a great funeral.
Open the door, let the dogs out.
Don't come over.
Panther, throw him here.
Sir, it's me.
I've seen it, go out and fight again, great Kung-fu master.
You dragged me to death.
Do you believe I would kick you to death?
Please, would you don't swing the car?
I will have care sick.
Congratulations...
Thank you.
I am not longer official.
Why do you open a drugs store... and quit you post?
I can't explain to you for you are too stupid.
Look at your sister and Yu Yin.
Honey.
Be careful, have a kiss.
Mrs. Pao.
I've given Mr. Pao... the hereditary nostrum.
After taking the medicine, he was capable to have two sons.
Now he is going to use this in business.
"India's miraculous cure"
From India.
I could have such great achievements is all because of His Majesty.
I miss him so much.
Luckily, I have his underwear as my collection.
I feel great after smelling it.
I gives me strength.
It's of good taste too.
Don't miss it.
Prince Tin has arrived.
Welcome...
Mr. Pao, I could send you any congratulations.
But I've to tell you a bad news.
His Majesty passed away.
His Majesty...
What's wrong with it?
Why?
- Sickness.
- What sickness?
It is...
Syphilis!
The moon is so pretty.
Sing, whenever the moon is so pretty, make a wish.
Then your wish will come true.
- Really?
- Yeah!
Moon,
I wish to be an Official.
I want to be a decent one, to arrest criminals and corrupted officials.
"Fair and Justice"
Who comes early in the morning?
Broken drum!
Broken board!
Poor court!
Ask you poor official out.
How dare you insult our Honour?
He is just a junior official.
He doesn't worth to be insulted by me, Mr. Fong Tong Kan.
Fong Tong Kan?
Are you the best lawyer in Canton, nick named "Mirror Fong"?
This is the lawsuit.
I represent Mr. Lin to accuse Wong Lo-chou's wife.
When Mr. Lam went to collect rent, she tried... to rape Mr. Lin.
You are framing me.
It was Mr. Lin who wanted to rape me wife.
Where is His Honour?
He's gone to your grandpa's home.
Check!
No way, I'll sit out.
I check again.
I will kill your king.
Don't think that you are great as being a magistrate.
How can I compete with you?
Have you remember what I told you?
You should be a decent and honest official.
Dad, but you were a...
Yes, I was corrupted official.
I could do anything for money.
Since I did so many bad deeds.
So, twelve of your brothers died before me.
Your brothers died one after another.
I could do nothing, but retried... - and donated all my wealth for charity.
That's why your live is kept.
See, I wrote a word for you as decoration.
That's "HONEST".
But, I think It's like the word "Poverty".
Uncle... what a big trouble...
- Uncle, grandpa.
- What's the matter?
Come, come and have some sweet soup.
It's delicious.
Kau, come and eat.
Mom, I am Sing, your 13th son.
Do I have so many sons?
Kid, who are you looking for?
I am your husband.
How about you?
I am your grandson, grandma.
My lovely little girl, you are so tall now.
Hubby, eat now, or it will get cold.
I am Sing, Mom.
Uncle, we will be rich.
Let "Mirrow Fong" lead the show.
We will get advantage in the middle.
Well done.
I've wasted so much to buy this post,
I just want money.
You bad kid.
I asked you not be corrupted official, why don't you listen to me?
Mirror Fong is the first lawyer in Canton.
Do you want to compete with him?
Stop dreaming.
It's alright, dad, I know it.
- Let's go.
- Grandpa, we are leaving.
Son, don't forget to take my calligraphy.
That calligraphy is left for you.
Why are you standing?
I am Fong Tong Kan.
Being a scholar, I needn't kneel in front of you.
How cocky you are!
You always help the rich to bully the poor.
Just like sending others shit in snowy season.
Be careful, if he passes the examination, he will be your senior.
I don't care, now.
I do want to teach you a lesson.
Thank you...
I've heard that your mom is hospitable.
No matter local people of foreigners, she won't mind.
I've known... that you always greet others "God-father".
You are welcome, but my mom is really hospitable.
No, he means your mom is hooker.
You mean my mom is a hooker, right?
Well, when did you see me... sending others shit in snowy season?
This is only a description.
Well, I mean... you mom is friendly only.
I don't always greet others God-father, you...
I don't know that.
But Wong's wife did intend... to rape Mr. Lin.
Please give her appropriate punishment.
His wife intended to rape him?
I am framed, sir.
Mr. Lin came to collate rent, he wanted to indecent assault her.
When I came back, I saw him holding my wife's hands.
He pressed my wife on the table, and wanted to rape her.
I couldn't help attacking him with the rod.
His fellows rushed in at once, and held me.
Lin Chi-Yong, you held other's hands.
Obviously, you wanted to rape his wife.
Sir, you are so smart today.
Really?
You look great.
I am always look great.
Are you your palms red?
Show me please.
What are you doing?
You said, holding hands mean raping, so, am I raping you now?
Take a seat and watch my show.
The fact is, Mr. Lin wanted to take his house back, for Wong and his wife didn't pay the rent.
They do want to blackmail...
Mr. Lin by raping him.
Please give a fair judgement.
No, sir.
The house was rented by Mr. Line's dad to my dad.
Since my dad saved his dad's life.
So, his dad let us the house which charges 30 tales a year.
We pay the rent every year.
Do are have and life deeds?
Show me.
- Yes.
- So tiny is this?
!
Well, why not this one?
It's father.
Which one do you want?
Big one please, I've got father of it.
Good boy.
You did greet me "God-father".
Right?
Would you read it out?
I, Lin Da-fu, am renting the house in Tai Shu Street... to my benefactor Wong, so as to repay his merit.
If no rent is paid, never mind charge 30 taels a year.
Do not collect it and rent to others.
My sons and grandsons should follow this title-deeds.
See?
Your dad said, you can't blame him if he doesn't pay the rent.
Instead, he pays the rent every year, how can you collect his house.
We pay 30 taels a year.
What?
It should be $300,000 taels.
What did you say?
Are you literate?
I know you are not.
Let me teach you.
You should read this in this way.
The house is rented to Wong, so as to repay his merit.
If no rent is paid, never mind charging $300,000 taels a year.
Do notice, collect it and rent to others.
How can you amend it like this?
Can you make your judgement now?
Do you want to be bribed from a delayed judgement?
This cheque for $3,000 taels, is not yours.
This is for you, you worth this much only.
Take it.
One tael?
- If you don't want it, just forget it.
- No.
Hurry up.
Announce your judgement now.
Wong didn't pay the rent, you should move out as soon as possible.
Return the house to Lin Chi-yong.
About the raping case, since she couldn't make it, just forget it.
Mr. Lin is so generous.
See you!
What a unfair world!
God-son, take me advice, you'd better go home and be a farmer.
How can you be an official?
You will never stop losing face, boy!
The Chi's sedan chair is here to pick up the bride.
Who is going to marry that consumptive?
Even Pao Lung Sing can be the government official, everything can happen.
Come on, have some tea.
Uncle, where are you going to?
I would like to take a walk.
- No...
- Why?
That's too mush.
Yu Fa, go and take a look first.
Mr. Pao is out.
Throw him to death...
Sir, there is something wrong.
I see.
Let's go from the rear exit.
Uncle, it's safe, come out.
It's alright.
Let's go!
What's the matter?
Welcome, Bastard!
Is it for you?
Impossible.
I am not called "Bastard".
Throw him to death.
Take a look, it's pretty.
Come and buy vegetable.
Mister, buy some, it's fresh.
We have been safe.
No one recognises me.
Mr. Pao.
Deep fried Mr. Pao!
Deep fried Pao Lung Sing.
Pal, this is tried stinky beancurd.
How is it related to Pao Lung Sing?
That bastard!
He is as stink as this.
How can you talk like this?
Deep fried Pao Lung Sing.
Today's story is...
Pao was raped by few strong men.
This corrupted officer deserves to be raped...
Am I that disgusting?
Yau Wai, tell me, tell me the truth.
Sometimes, after starring at you for a while.
I do want to vomit.
But I think a little bit reservation is needed.
Pao was towed to the muddy pool, the muscular men fed him with shit, but he loved it.
He even enjoyed eating shit.
He said, "I can't stop eating!".
Did I do anything bad to you, thus you hate me that much?
Anyway, I am an official!
Although I am not very handsome.
But you needn't tease me like this.
I don't think everyone hates me that much.
Anybody likes me, hands up.
Go...
Well, you don't like to raise your hand, just forget it.
But you ran away, what does that mean?
Where are they going to?
To take weapon.
Throw him to death...
I think, they are against me only.
That's truth.
What a failure!
I make no money, and make everyone hate me.
I'd better educate the next generation.
Because the children will master the future.
If only they like me, I will have future.
Little friend.
You good boy, I love you, kid.
I can't imagine.
How can a kid spit so much.
Kidding?
How can that consumptive get married?
That's right.
Wonderful.
He is fighting in my territory, but he didn't inform me beforehand.
I'm Panther, the No.1 constable, I'm here to arrest the Notorious 10.
Whoever blocks my way, who will be killed with no mercy.
What's wrong with this sedan chair?
Son, go and pick your bride up.
What a waste!
Will her husband die suddenly tonight?
If he dies, then you will replace him?
I didn't say so, you said it.
Mr. Pao.
I am not Pal, mind your tongue, or I will report to the court.
You needn't deny,
I recognise you from your special smell.
Thank you for coming to our wedding party, I feel so proud of you.
Uncle, you are appreciated.
You have to thank God.
Old man, are you appreciating me?
If there is corrupted official, we, traffickers could make money easily.
So you are a trafficker!
Sir, please give me face, go in and join our party.
Alright, let's go.
- Remember to give us a red pocket.
- This way.
Please...
Give me a cheerful face.
It will be alright soon, it's almost done.
Old man, your son seems to be seriously sick.
He is fine.
Don't cough the lung out, pal.
It's okay!
What is it?
A piece of liver!
Pal, I don't need this for making hot pot.
I feel so comfortable.
It's finished, take a rest please.
Uncle, they are going to get married, stop dreaming.
What?
He may die during the wedding.
He even coughed out his liver.
Is that real liver?
What do you think?
Thank you!
Cousin Yuen Kwan, congratulations, you've a daughter-in-law now.
I am his step-mother only.
None of my business.
I know... you've kept a hand copy of Wahyim Sutra.
Could you let me have a look?
You go first.
How can you escape?
Panther, your sword is powerful,
- if you have guts, drop your sword.
- Alright!
Attack!
Panther, your hands are powerful, if you have guts, just fight with us without using your hands.
Alright.
Attack!
You have powerful feet.
If you have guts, fight with us without using hands, legs, and sword.
Alright!
His voice is really powerful.
Someone is killed, report to the court now.
I am an official.
How about me?
I am the first constable.
I am Lui Pao, nick named "Panther".
I've chased after these notorious robbers... for 7 days and nights.
You've kept them here.
Sir, I don't know what had happened.
Don't you know they were coming to your party?
Sir, my son's getting married.
I didn't know they had sneaked in.
Really?
Sir, I daren't cheat you.
Mr. Pao, don't you think so?
Mr. Pao, where have you been?
Mr. Pao...
Sir, he is paying no respect to us.
It's faceless to hide under the table.
Shut up, let's take a rest here, it's fine.
He seems to be powerful now,
I just let him be number one first.
Once he loses control, he will do something wrong, then I will go out to attack.
What's the matter?
I'm researching how to eat the roasted pig, why do you disturb me.
You are the official of this place, right?
Right, I am.
You must have linked with him to give those robbers protection.
And you wanted to rebel against the government, right?
He is as good as you at framing others.
Since we are of the same kind, let's share the money we are going to blackmail.
Maybe, I will take the bigger share.
I want all.
That's good.
What can I help you?
I tell you, my visit today, is being an undercover, to check whether you've committed crime.
Thank God.
We've discovered you.
You are the man behind of so many criminal cases.
Men, take him back.
Sir, none of my business, sir.
I am framed.
None of my business.
- Deal.
- Thank you!
They said they will give us 50 thousand taels within two hours.
Why not go back... and asked 2 girls to dine with us?
Just 2?
I want twenty!
Sir, please wait here.
I am going to check whether the girls have come or not.
They are coming.
Have they arrived?
Go and serve Mr. Panther, got me?
Sir.
You bastard, how dare you offend me?
You shit-head.
That bastard Mr. Pao has fallen into the hole.
Bastard, throw him to death...
- He deserves it.
- You are great Kung-fu master?
What are you doing?
Are you playing?
Have you listening to what I said?
How can you drop rats into it?
Mr. Panther, don't panic.
I will let a snake eat up all the rats.
Wait for me, Uncle.
Hurry up.
The banquet must have been finished.
I just want to eat the dessert only.
It's almost dawn, you will be lucky if they reserve an orange for you.
Your Honour...
I am not...
Your Honour, don't go.
We know that you are great.
You fixed that Panther... and saved Chi's family.
We represent Chi's family to welcome you.
Let's clap our hands to welcome Mr. Pao.
You are great!
Bravo!
Mr. Pao, would you say something to us?
Mind your tongue, say something decent.
Have you eaten the noodles yet?
Mr. Pao, we haven't eaten the roasted pig yet, we have reserved one for you.
Let's go.
Let's go for our dinner.
Thank you Sir, you are really wise.
You're welcome, take this as my gift.
Old man, haven't you eaten the roasted pig yet?
Kid, it's you again!
Do you want to spit again?
Stop it, or I will beat you up.
This is for you.
Great, Mr. Pao.
Thank you.
Treat you wife better, or I will lock you up.
And, take care.
Eat more liver, it's nutritious.
Go and enjoy your first night.
Go now, go...
I don't want to marry you.
I want to marry Mr. Pao.
Mr. Pao...
Siu Lin...
Great, Siu Lin...
Come here, Siu Lin.
Uncle, what are you doing?
Being started by the handsome men and pretty girls.
Go!
Be careful of fire.
"Pretend to have stomach ache.
Line up for a toilet."
- "Pretend to have stomach ache..."
- Help!
- What's the matter?
- Go.
Don't move.
Let me do it.
You'd better go.
Uncle, if you can't make it, let me take your place.
Damn it, how dare you hit me?
The Chi's family was killed...
Don't touch anything.
How dare you!
Bite, bite with all your strength.
I won't panic.
Uncle, stop playing with him.
Watch out.
None of my business.
Let go of me...
How dare you, do you know...
I know nothing.
Do you understand...
I know nothing.
- Bastard!
Men, prepare for punishment.
- Beat him.
Do you want to beat me?
How dare you beat me?
You are such a junior staff!
You know?
My dad is the Navy Commander, Sir Shang Kwan.
Is Navy Commander a senior post?
Much more senior then yours.
Brother Shang, have you eaten yet?
Brother Shang, do you want some tea?
How about the finest tea?
No way, I am a decent and honest official.
Shit, even the emperor commits the law.
- He should be perished.
- "Punished".
Just the same, if he were the son of the emperor!
Mrs. Chi, did he kill your family?
Yes, Sir!
My family, all together 13 people, were killed by him.
Please give a fair judgement.
What the hell is this?
Tell me now.
Sir!
Shang Wai is my mother-in-law's cousin.
He always visits our family.
On that night, since my hubby was sick.
I want to worship God to beg good luck for him.
Suddenly.
Someone covered my face with a handkerchief.
I could smell some medicine.
Then I fainted.
When I woke up,
I was...
I was raped by Shang Wai.
You beast!
Men!
Beat him 12738 times.
Stop!
I'd better do it myself.
Uncle, don't get mad, listen to her story first.
Alright, go on.
On that night...
You beast, you are inhuman...
Enough!
You were unconscious just then.
Why not make love again as a compensations to you?
Don't come over.
You asshole.
How dare you!
You've had secret affair with her!
Shut up!
Hands off me!
Shut up...
Shut up...
Yuen Kwan...
You bastard, you killed my wife.
I won't let you go, I want to report to the court.
Father!
I want to kill you, I want to kill you.
Don't be impulsive, listen to her story first.
Time reporter, what had happened?
I was reporting time.
Suddenly,
I heard Chi's dog barking madly.
So I want in and checked.
Suddenly, I saw dead bodies everywhere.
And I saw Shang Wai and Loi Fook fighting.
Later, I was kicked and I lost consciousness.
I saw nothing then.
Summon Loi Fook.
Did Shang Wai kill 13 people of Chi's family?
Yes...
He wanted to kill me too.
Don't panic, I am here to protect you.
Help, sir, please help me.
You said you would protect me.
He did give me face.
If I were not around, he would have bitten you to death.
Thank you Sir.
- Then, what happened?
- Lock him up temporarily, chop him after examining the bodies.
Lock him up first,
- chop him after examination of bodies.
- Yes.
You want to kill me?
I won't give it a damn.
I won't give it a damn.
What did you say...
You made a mistake.
Where is justice?
Mrs. Chi.
Don't worry, I will try my best.
To take revenge for your family.
Uncle, you've done a great job.
What's shinning?
It's the light from the gold, Sir.
It's you?
We work for our own masters in the court.
And I'd like... to compensate now.
What compensation?
As an old Chinese saying, there is golden house in the books.
If you do me a small favour, you needn't study, but get his golden house free.
Let's discuss it.
What do you mean?
Mister Shang Wai is the son of Sir Shang Kwan.
You have know it, right?
But, do you know that...
Mr. Shang is the buddy... of Eunuch Li.
Who is that?
Isn't he Li Lin-ying, the most powerful eunuch?
He is the right hand...
- of the Empress Dowager.
- You scared me.
These money... is sent buy Mr. Shang to you as present.
What the hell do you want?
Mr. Shang's mom is now 97 years old.
She loves Mr. Shang very much.
She heard the news about Mr. Shang.
She's been crying again and again.
Mr. Shang hopes you.
Mr. Pao, to let Mrs. Shang pay a visit to her grandson.
Sir, you'd better take an easily the rest.
Tomorrow, I will lead Mrs. Shang to leave the prison.
Why don't you just give a hand to such simple matters?
Are you bribing me?
Isn't it the practice of you?
I have been an honest and decent...
I won't be brided, I tell you.
- Have you ever heard of it?
- Yes!
But, just be considerate, she is so old.
Yeah, she is old, I have to respect her.
Filial duty is the first thing we Chinese should do.
I am a little bit tired.
- Yau Wai, lead them to the prison.
- Yes!
Wait!
When I wake up,
I want Shang Wai kneeling in the court, got me?
Sure... thank you Sir.
This way please.
She is almost a hundred's years old.
She just wants to see grandson, it's alright.
Let me go...
You know?
My dad is the Navy Commander.
My God-father is Eunuch Li.
I want to kill your family.
Don't chat so long, you know, you will make me feel difficult.
- Sorry for bothering.
- Thank you!
Who are you?
Your grandma is coming to visit you.
Grandma?
Dad...
Are you looking for death?
You have made a big trouble.
Dad, take me away.
Where can you go?
I am the Navy Commander.
Even you escaped, the government'd still request me to arrest you.
I disguise to visit you, it's a big risk you know?
If I am discovered, I would be in trouble.
- What'll I do?
I am scared.
- Don't worry.
I've employed Mr. Fong to defend for you.
Mr. Shang, you have to tell me every details.
Don't miss anything.
How is the case?
Can you help?
Luckily, it's 5 o'clock, we still have 4 hours to work.
What are we going to do?
To change white to black.
To change the accused to be the prosecutor.
Tomorrow, you have to remember...
Court...
Yau Wai...
What's the matter, Uncle?
I haven't got up yet, why you start the court?
Mr. Chan has come back early in the morning.
Mr. Chan.
Yes, he is the magistrate, you are the acting magistrate.
He's recovered, so he will be judge of this court.
You've had a sound sleep,
- so I didn't wake you up.
- Shit!
Uncle...
Sir.
Sir, this case has been...
Cut the crap, step aside.
- Step aside.
- Yes.
Uncle, sit here.
Damn it.
Mrs. Chi, you sue Shang Wai of killing your family.
Other than you, who has witnessed it?
Summon the coroner.
Sir, 13 people of Chi's family and a dog.
Their faces all turned to black.
I tested it with a silver needle, it turned black too.
I am sure that they were poisoned to death.
I discovered a pot of sweet soup.
It's mixed with arsenic.
How dare you!
Your family was poisoned to death.
Why did you claim they were beaten to death by Shang Wai?
You are framing him, aren't you?
Sir, I am framed.
Sir, I saw Shang Wai chasing after her servant...
Who saw Shang Wai chasing Loi Fook?
I saw it, the time reporter saw it too.
Time reporter?
Summon the time reporter.
Sir, I didn't see Shang Wai chasing after Loi Fook.
When I entered the Chi's garden, I saw Loi Fook... chasing after Shang Wai, Shang wanted to counter attack.
Later, I was kicked by Loi Fook, then fainted.
I didn't know anything at all.
This is not what you said last night, you...
I felt dizzy last night, so I couldn't tell every details.
Think before talking, such thing...
Shut up!
Summon the drugs store keeper Chu Yee.
Right, sir.
Yesterday at noon.
This woman came to my store to buy drugs.
She said there were rats in her house, so I sold her a catty of arsenic.
I didn't, Sir.
I didn't buy any arsenic in this store.
I always go there... to buy coughing herbs.
Who is it?
Sir, I am Fong Tong Kan, I want to sue someone.
He...
Who are you going to sue?
I represent Mr. Shang to sue...
Mrs. Chi who blackmailed My.
Shang.
She failed, thus she framed him of murdering.
I want to sue Mr. Pao, he is bribed and want to fame Mr. Shang.
Sir, I've heard that,
Mr. Pao has been bribed by Mrs. Chi with $30,000.
Now, his house is filled with money.
Really?
- Men, go check it.
- Yes!
Sir, we are trapped.
- No, I have to tidy up our place first.
- Freeze.
Sir, there is much money in Mr. Pao's place.
Pao, you are now temporarily suspended.
Until the truth has been discovered.
Mrs. Chi didn't give me money, he gave me money.
How dare you framing others now?
If your speak up again, I will beat you.
I...
Uncle, save it, they are allied.
Come on.
Just stay with me.
My God-son, I can't help you now.
And, I want to sue Mrs. Chi who killer her whole family.
Sir, I am framed.
Sharing Wai killed my family.
How are you miss up in court?
- Men beat her mouth.
- Yes!
I am framed.
Sir, how come the accused become the prosecutor?
You are fired.
If you don't keep your mouth shut, I will beat you to nuts.
Men, summon Shang Wai.
Sir!
Sir, I am Yiu's brother.
Last night!
I discovered the secret affair of Mrs. Chi and Loi Fook.
Mrs. Chi begged me not to disclose the secret.
And she asked me to discuss with her in her place.
I went to her place, she made some sweet soup.
But her family had all gone.
She wanted to treat me sweet soup.
You are lying...
- Beat her mouth again.
- Yes Sir.
Sir...
I suspected that, and I didn't drink it.
Later, I discovered her family were all dead.
Loi Fook rushed in to kill me, he asked his dog to bite me.
I am scared, and I rushed to the street, Loi Fook was after me.
Suddenly, he shouted for help.
I didn't know what kind of code is that,
Later, Mr. Pao and his men arrived, they arrested me.
You are lying...
Summon the gynecologist.
Sir...
I've checked...
Mrs. Chi.
On the day the tragedy happened, she was mated with someone.
And she is now pregnant.
That's right.
Her husband is having phthisis.
Doctor said he couldn't have son.
The public knows it.
Now she is pregnant, it proves her affair with Loi Fook.
Summon Loi Fook.
Sir!
How dare you seduce your master?
And you killed Chi's family, don't you know it's felony?
Sir, I did have secret affair with Mrs. Chi.
But I didn't poison Chi's family, she did it alone.
I didn't...
You are lying!
How can she fall for you?
Who will believe in you?
Show me evidence.
Mrs. Chi loves me, for she thinks that I am civilized, she sent me a poem.
I've brought it here, sir, let me read it out.
"Once we meet, I know we are two of a kind."
"Who cares how long can we stay, just enjoy our time".
Sir, please read this.
I am framed.
How dare you hook with your servant, and poisoned you family to death?
Now, all evidences are enough to prove you are guilty.
Are you going to admit it?
I am framed.
Give her punishment.
Sir, stop it, she can stand no more.
Uncle, stop arguing.
Sir, my ancestors and I have been officials for three generations.
I know pretty well that, traps are needed in politics.
But, you are going too far now.
You have no say here.
No...
Go on.
Mrs. Chi confessed.
Well, she will have her capital punishment after Autumn.
- Yes.
- Lock her up now.
Adjourn.
Sorry!
You bastard, you allied with them to set me up.
I won't let you go.
Snow!
It's snowing.
Snow in June.
It's a set up.
Come and have judgement again...
- Uncle...
- It's a set up.
The house is empty, where can we get the evidence?
Are you expecting the evidence is put on the table?
You should discover is yourself.
Bravo.
A tough dog.
Isn't it the dog of Chi?
Bill!
How do you know that?
Who wrote it?
I remembered, you asked them not to move the evidence, and you wanted them to label it.
God is helping me.
Show me its head.
Turn it!
Not poisoned?
Obviously, its neck was broken.
It's killed.
Why were they found poisoned?
I have to check the bodies.
It's felony to interrupt the dead bodies.
Oh, the head is connected by needles.
If the needle is pulled, the body will be separated.
He was beaten to death.
But the needle turns black.
It proves that, there is poisoned substance inside their throats.
Hurry up, it stinks.
I have to check another body.
Try stabbing into the stomach.
If they are poisoned, the needle will turn black too.
It isn't, there is no poisoned substance inside his stomach.
But there is poison in the throat?
I guess, they were beaten to death.
Then, the poison was poured into their throat.
So, the poison could never reach the stomach.
Right!
I've got it.
Bingo!
I've got it.
Bravo.
Sir, why are you here?
I am coming to arrest you.
Do you want to destroy the evidence?
You will be put in jail.
Mr. Chan.
Mr. Shang.
Well done.
You are very wise.
You know they will come back to look for evidence.
Set a fire and destroy everything.
Yes Sir.
And, uproot the trouble.
Ask someone to go to the prison and...
Pal, please tell my senior, how about let me change... to be stained waitress...
You nuts.
Your nephew is smarter than you, he is the stained waitress.
He is going to against you.
He is now staying home and having soup.
- You deserve it.
- What id you say?
You corrupted official.
You deserve to be put it jail.
I am not in good mood, cut the crap.
I won't give you face.
So what?
Come and fight with me if you have guts.
Don't push me, I will beat you.
You bastard, you should stay with that bitch.
Which bitch?
What did you say?
Repeat.
That's Mrs. Chi.
She is right behind you.
You mean behind this wall?
Yeah.
You should have told me earlier.
Mrs. Chi, I am Pao Lung Sing.
Where are you?
Save you crocodile's tears.
Just charge me anything you want.
In fact, I do want to go to heaven to stay with my husband.
What a pity that,
I am having his baby.
Is that consumptive's blood?
No, I mean you husband?
My husband has got a hereditary nostrum.
He took medicine regularly, he had almost recovered.
And he got the reproductive ability too.
So great.
Why don't you come here?
So you could torture me.
You misunderstood.
Look at me.
In order to fight for justice for you.
I was dragged down too.
I misunderstand you, I am sorry.
It doesn't matter, I wish I could go out.
And you will let me copy your hereditary nostrum.
However,
I think they will kill me this time.
Sir, I am sorry.
Please don't say that.
Mrs. Chi, please give me your finger.
I don't think there is no justice at all.
I promise, once I am alive.
I will try my beat to save you.
Thank you Mr. Pao.
Uncle...
- You bastard.
- Cut the crap.
- You are sentenced to death.
- Death?
They said you allied with notorious robbers.
Smuggling arms.
Pushed an old lady to the sea.
And raped a pig.
Never, I didn't rape a pig.
Anyway, they wanted to frame you.
You will be dead meat.
I've discussed with grandpa.
Before your death, we want you to leave a descendant.
So, we've got you a virgin.
- I want that too.
- You will be the next.
Cut the crap, go in and reproduce.
Yu Fa, hurry up.
It's you.
Of course.
Don't waste time, hurry up.
Yau Wai, mask me please.
You needn't be masked, but I have a new method. "Incredible Stance!"
Yu Fa, you are incredible!
Cut the crap, let's go now.
Mrs. Chi, don't worry,
I will come back to save you.
Go.
Sir, I wish you to be safe.
Lucky forever.
Son, I am glad you are back.
Great, you have got you memory.
Mom.
Son, it's great to see you.
Your dad is seriously sick.
Are you alright?
I am glad you are rescued.
I am useless, I lost you face.
How come?
It's you who is not as vicious as them.
A corrupted should be vicious.
A decent official should be more vicious.
Or, how can you cope with those bastards?
Son, go to the capital to sue them.
I do want to do so.
I have half cake.
I've kept this for 20 years, you'd better make good use of it.
What is it?
The Judicial Secretary is... my best friend.
Once he was almost starved to death.
I had a cake, I just gave him all.
Late, he returned half to me.
He said, when he got rich, if my descendants took this cake to him.
He would try his best to help us.
But I am afraid I couldn't compete with them.
How come?
We are from the Pao's family.
In Sung Dynasty, our ancestor Pao Ching...
- The Great Judge?
- Yeah, that's him.
He wrote this sacred scroll.
I've learnt everything.
Why don't you tell me earlier?
Where is it now?
It's under the table.
But I can't read such letters!
This is ancient letters.
You didn't study hard, that's why you don't know.
Ask someone to teach you.
I know it, dad.
What else do you have?
We have a Royal Sword.
It is sent by the Emperor, take this to the capital.
Where is it now?
Take it.
This is authorised to kill the corrupted king and vicious officials.
Take it.
Yau Wai, keep the sword.
Dad.
I just want to...
What's wrong with you?
Do you want to set me free so as to kill Pao Lung Sing?
You are nasty too.
I will kill him into pieces.
Yau Wai, mom does give us some gold.
Why do you carry so many carrots?
That's the gold which Grand-mom mentioned.
I think these carrots are enough for us to go to the capital.
Uncle, there is something over there.
That idiot seems to be you.
No, he isn't like that.
Thank God.
Uncle, is this the look you've just made?
It seems to be very dangerous.
We passed.
That's him.
Don't go.
Run!
Don't go!
Hurry up, it's getting dark.
Hurry up, let's go on board.
Untie the boat.
Don' go, bastard!
Don't chase after me.
Wait for me.
A girl.
Why did you risk so much?
Someone wants to kill me, so I should run for my life.
Don't go.
You can never escape.
Bastard!
Don't go, bastard.
Who is he calling?
He is greeting me as Betty.
Betty?
Thank you for your help.
May I know your name?
Stone Mansion.
- And you.
- Stone Talk.
Don't mention and don't talk?
- Stone Mansion.
- Stone Talk.
Forget it.
Why did the guy chase after you?
I know it...
He wanted to rape her, so...
Nuts, he is a man.
Don't panic,
I will be the boss, I will help you to calm down.
Come on, eat now.
Miss Stone, are you going to the capital?
Yes, we are.
But we won't go into the capital.
- Come on, help yourself.
- Sure.
Why not go there together, so we can take care of each other.
Ask brother.
But you have to help us in the show.
I know nothing.
You may take a lesson.
What?
Come and eat some food, come on.
Take this.
Come on.
Underwear.
Ying, where are you going?
I don't want to bother you, since I know you are not happy with me.
I'd better leave.
Where are you going?
I don't know, just go anywhere.
You'd better get a shelter here.
- If you stay, I will take care of you.
- Thank you.
I won't reject your hospitality.
You are nasty.
I...
Damn it, just a small trick!
Now, I have got free accommodation and meal.
What a coincidence?
How did you come in?
There is a hole.
That's the hole for the rat.
I know how to shrink my body.
Wonderful!
Cut the crap, the inn is full.
I am afraid we have to sleep in the same bed.
How come?
We are men,
- unless you are...
- I am not.
So, come on.
Ying, come out now.
I am coming.
What's the matter?
- Your relative wants to see you.
- My relative?
I've found you at last.
Shut up, I don't want to see you, get lost.
- I don't...
- Shut up.
- I don't...
- Shut up!
Why don't you let me greet you?
Miss Betty.
You are so smart!
If I were smart, I wouldn't have been beaten.
You almost discovered my secret.
What?
Miss Betty.
They are so kind to let you stay, why do you cheat them?
Sorry, she is a girl.
- She is called Betty at home.
- Dad!
You are a woman?
!
You know, it's not convenient for a girl to fool around.
So she dressed like this.
Girl, say sorry to them.
Go.
Oh, you're your brother's sister... and you're your sister's brother too!
Please don't tease me.
Miss Betty, would you please come over?
Stop bothering.
I want to tell you something about Uncle Sing.
I will be right back.
I've checked, this circus is going to the capital.
We just have two carrots, how can we afford going North?
Let's follow them to the capital!
You needn't teach me.
Brother, you can't do that to her!
She is a girl.
I don't know it at all.
So, you know it now?
Ying!
Sleep with me tonight.
Great!
Wait, I daren't sleep together, I am afraid of darkness.
No problem, I will accompany you.
What a beautiful moon.
It won't be beautiful soon, come and sleep.
Have you chatted with others on the roof top?
I hate this most.
I forgot which old man told me.
When the moon is most pretty, tell her your wish, then your wish will come true.
Have you ever made a wish to the moon?
How about you?
I made a wish, I want to be a decent official.
Until now, I know it's hard to be a decent official.
But I am between decent and nasty.
I achieved nothing.
I've heard the muscular man... scolded our as bastard,
who are you?
- My surname is Pao.
- Are you Pao Lung Sing?
Do you know me?
All the people in nearby provinces know you!
You were fired in order to fight for justice for a woman.
You courage is praised.
In fact I am not.
I daren't look down.
To my mind, you are the most courageous hero.
Since you force me, I have to admit.
Since I love low profile.
And, please don't report to the court.
I may sleep outside.
If you don't sleep with me, your identity will be easily disclosed.
You'd better take care.
Think of me any time.
You've to wear more clothes when you are doing shows.
Remember, think of me, got me?
- Don't court girls.
- Don't seduce man.
Don't worry, I won't.
When will we meet again?
Next year, we will meet in Spring when the flowers blossom.
Take care.
- Is this your cake?
- Yes!
I am glad to see you, how is your dad?
He has just passed away.
Why kind hearted people don't have long life?
Be frank,
I come a long way here to meet you,
I just want to help me to sue someone in front of the Emperor.
What is it about?
I was an official.
But a rich guy hooked with a corrupted official...
Stop it!
Damn it!
I hate such kind of people most.
Uncle, I am so glad to meet you.
Tell me, who is that guy?
I will fight for justice for you by all means.
He is called Shang Wai.
His dad is that bastard Shang Kwan, the Navy Commander.
Your Excellency, what do you think?
What's your idea?
I wish I could chop their heads off.
And use their heads to clean my ass.
Uncle, let it clean mine too.
After cleaning your ass, return it to me, I will clean mine again.
Old man, do you have interest to clean yours with their heads?
I will lend it to you.
Do I have a shave?
Uncle, may I know your name?
I am Shang Kwan!
It's a trap!
I won't give it a damn!
Your Excellency, it's so decent of you that,
- this guy...
- Save your breath.
- What?
- Save your breath!
Go now.
The officials are protecting each other.
My dad helped you once.
Even you don't help me, you should give me some advantage.
May be, pay me a million or something.
You dad just gave me a tasteless cake.
I could just repay you a cake.
But I am kind enough to pay you 100 times of it.
You really have guts.
Yau Wai, let's go.
Freeze, you needn't hurry.
Why not eat the cake first?
Men, feed them with cakes.
Come on, open you mouth.
Swallow it...
How dare you!
Even the Emperor could do nothing to me.
Why not kill them?
No, I want them to stay in the capital to be beggars!
So as to lose his dad's face.
Yau Wai, how are you?
Are you alright?
I feel a little bit hungry.
- Thank you for you help.
- You are welcome.
Daughter-in-law, come and thank his Excellency.
- Thank you...
- You're welcome...
When will you give birth to the baby?
Next month,
- you have to join this birthday party.
- Sure...
Get away...
Come on, buy some incense.
You will be blessed.
Miss, come and buy some incense, come on.
Do you want to sell incense?
Uncle, we have been driven to a dead end.
We will have some way out.
I know, but we haven't eaten for days.
Thank you...
Pal, but I am an official.
Free buns!
Miss, please give me one, one more please.
I haven't eaten for days.
Yau Wai, don't take those buns.
If you take it, you will become a beggar at once.
I prefer being a beggar, forget about me.
- Listen to me please.
- Don't block my way.
Someone is distributing money.
Yau Wai.
If I am used to be a beggar, I could never be an official again.
I won't be a beggar!
How dare you cheat for meal in our place?
Go to hell.
Go to hell...
Pal, you cheat for a free lunch?
So what?
I'm going to some place else.
Right, I'd like to be a cheater.
Come again when you have time.
Mister, I can tell from your face that, you must be a visitor.
I can tell you must be rich.
Fung, Chun, come and serve our VIP tea.
Come on, have some tea.
You don't like it?
Come to our VIP room then.
I will serve you with the best dishes, come on.
Mister, don't hurry, take care.
Eat some more fish, come on.
Are you full?
Well, have some wine.
- Come on, this is my toast.
- Stop bothering me.
Come on, drink it.
No one cares only eating in a prostitute house!
- Nuts!
- No, he isn't nuts.
He's good taste, he is not interested in such ordinary girls.
I've to serve him with our treasure...
Yu Yin.
Let's go out...
You...
Don't care who I am.
It's fate for us... to know each other now.
I...
Shut up, let's close our eyes, to guess the character of each other, say identity and interest.
One two three.
You are a woman.
You are a decent woman, you don't care about money.
And...
Guess what I am.
I don't know your past.
But, later...
You will become a handicapped person.
You haven't a penny, how dare you come to our place?
Don't come over.
Or, I will stab her eyes.
How dare you visit a prostitute house without money?
No money but have great meal?
!
And order girls to accompany you.
I will cut your balls out.
How dare you?
Have you seen it?
This is the correct way to beat him.
No money at all?
Just some cheap clothes?
Damn it.
Just one old book!
Don't touch my book...
Don't burn my book.
You can't damage it.
Don't!
- It's over.
- From this day onward, you have to be gigolo for three months.
Clean it, work hard.
Poor the water.
How poor is he, he can't shut up his mouth.
How can he eat?
Ask your mistress out.
Or.
I will scold her family as well.
What's the matter?
Your girls have taken all my customers, what do you think?
The clients pay whoever they like, it's not our fault.
No way, I want you to repay my loss, give me tea and say sorry.
Otherwise, I will teach you good lesson.
Do you want to quarrel with me?
Your son has no ass, your dad is a gigolo.
You have broken ass, you love eating chicken ass.
Big ass, how can you blame me for your poor business?
- Let me scold you...
- No, I will tell you my story first.
My dad died when I was three, when I was 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, my dad died too.
I started to seduce man early at 10,
I slept with your man too.
- How dare you, old bluffer!
- If you've guts to show me your man,
I'll have the guts to court him.
I want to squeeze you to death.
You have guts to squeeze me, I have guts to enjoy it.
I...
Damn you.
What is this word?
- Isn't it "Smart"?
- It's "Smart"...
Damn it, it's "Shame", don't you feel shame?
You started to seduce man at 7, now you are 40 something.
Don't you feel shame?
You'd better go to hell.
What have you achieved in your life?
I've trained 4 famous hookers, they are the top ones in the capital.
Right, but they are now under me.
Haven't they told you?
You are old and you have no money.
Even your girls left you, you should suicide.
You are stupid, even you become a ghost, you'll be a stupid ghost.
You will become a shit-head in your next life.
- What does that mean?
- Shit-head!
Do you want to quarrel with me?
Got lost!
Wonderful.
- I love you.
- Good.
Go to hell!
- What are you doing?
- Don't ask me.
Don't you feel it?
Close your eyes first.
You still want to fool me like this?
I was terribly beaten.
I won't beat you,
I just want to chat with someone.
Why?
I feel lonely, and I feel cold.
Is it that serious?
I always face those bastards,
I can't make friends with them.
- I am bastard too.
- No, you are not that bad.
That's right.
Hold me.
Do you need that?
I won't fool you.
I just want a man who is not so disgusting to give me warmth.
No way?
Just take this as charity.
Alright.
Be frank, you have to give me a red pocket.
Bastard, how dare you court my girl?
- Do you want to quarrel with me?
- I don't want to quarrel with you.
I pay you living, how dare you court my girl?
You heartless man.
She said it's boring to be hooker, she is bored.
She just wants me to comfort her.
You are hooker, and is an old hooker.
Have you ever felt Lonely and cold?
Yes.
None of your business.
None of my business?
I'm working in a prostitute house, I don't want you to have happy life.
If you are not in good mood, you will treat the clients badly.
No clients come and we will close.
If we closed, I've to sleep on the road.
Isn't it my business?
How dare you answer back?
You will suffer!
Before my death, I will pack up your bones for you.
Your son will have no ass.
You mean your son?
How long can you be that cocky?
Until you die.
- I...
- You are beautiful if you don't make up.
You will live happily if you die.
- You...
- I will drive you mad anyway.
If I were a ghost, I would have scared you to death.
How come this guy is so powerful... in quarrelling?
- Are you alright?
- Get lost!
Kid, don't go if you have guts.
I will look for help and quarrel with you.
I am waiting.
- You...
- Damn...
We heard you had a terrible quarrel with Auntie San?
She even twisted her lips.
It was no big deal.
You're the "Sharp Tongue" in the brothel now.
Someone comes to challenge us again.
- How dare you!
- Let me handle it.
I'm working now.
If Yu Yin doesn't come to serve me tonight.
I'll turn this place over to find the criminal.
Impossible.
She doesn't sell her body.
I won't pay, that's okay.
- What are you doing?
- Panther is here!
Hide up.
There's a pond over there.
Sir.
Sir, don't to this.
I'll shout for help.
Go ahead!
Nobody will hear you.
Help...
Beast!
Could you stop now.
The Duke is here.
He wants Yu Yin too.
- Really?
- Yes, he brought a pate young man with him.
There's someone.
Duke!
So this is Yu Yin.
No...
Kidding, she is so pretty, but you said "No"?
No wonder, she is the number one here.
Brother...
Have a chat.
Come with me.
Yes, take you time.
Don't do this.
I'm going to scream.
Go ahead!
It's useless.
Beast!
There's a guest with Yu Yin.
Damn!
I'm the Secretary for home Affair, who is going to stop me?
- Please, Secretary for home Affair.
- Get lost.
He's here?
If he catches me here, he'll tell the queen,
I'll be in deep shit.
It's a pond out there.
Under the bed.
Please don't go in...
How dare you lie to me?
There's no one here.
You can have a bridge party now.
Can you handle it?
Don't worry.
Nice to meet you.
- What's your name?
- Ai-Shin-Chue-Luo.
Stop it!
Or I'll scream.
Go ahead.
It's useless.
How come men are all like this?
I'm getting bored.
Beast!
Have you ever played the "animal chess"?
Elephant eats tiger, tiger eats cat, cat eats rat, rat eats elephant!
Rat, you know what to do?
Who is it?
Sir, a great hero like you indeed acts bravely in bed, too.
I'm here to learn your skill.
Bastard!
Get out!
Sure, but I have a big mouth.
I just don't know how to keep secrets.
So hundreds people might come to admire you like I do.
They'll be you cheering team.
Here's the money!
Get out.
I pay you, do it quickly.
I...
It's either you or me to leave.
You go!
Alright, you go...
- Help...
- What's the matter?
You arranged some audiences here?
Like what I did.
Come out.
Who are they?
They're the professionals who do talk shows.
They will tell... a new story about you.
I'm sure... the audiences will love it.
Just forget me.
Only one?
We've four.
Alright, three more.
Thank you.
You were great!
Take it!
You are pretty smart.
You Majesty.
How do you know that?
Forgive me please.
I found your royal underwear.
Please forgive me.
Maybe it was dropped for I am being scared.
Your Majesty.
It's a secret that.
I came to the brothel.
Whoever tells,
I'll kill all his family.
Your Majesty, I have to ask for a favor.
If you don't help me, I'll tell the secret.
I'd rather get killed.
How dare you threaten me?
Your Majesty, everyone is having a happy and stable life.
Is it?
Then why would someone file a lawsuit?
Some villains are too bored with their life.
Set up, it must be a set up.
But Pao seems... to be decent.
Pao looks like a rat.
His father was well known for his corruption.
Like father, like son.
- He is corrupted too.
- Right...
- Is he that bad?
- Sure!
He came here to sue someone before?
Summon Pao Lung Sing.
- You Majesty.
- Rise.
According to my information.
He even work as a pimp in a brothel.
I'm sure Your Majesty won't trust a pimp's words.
- Unless you've been...
- Bastard!
How could an Emperor visit there?
Yes...
I've never been a pimp.
I hide up to study.
I want to return to fight for justice.
You're never been a pimp?
Bring Auntie San.
Luckily I've got the secret information.
He would be dead meat.
This woman is the owner of that brothel!
She'll identify Pao.
Yes, sir.
Is he the pimp of your brothel?
No!
I've never met him.
What's wrong?
You've never seen pretty girls?
Step aside.
If he's not a pimp, I can trust his words now.
Tell us about your case.
I used to be an alternate judge.
But I was bullied by my boss, Chan Pak Cheung.
Who framed a poor woman.
She was pregnant and yet she was sentenced to death.
I need a fair trial.
He's lying, anyway, he's a criminal.
What was his crime?
He tried to interrupt dead bodies.
No, I tried to investigate the real cause of victims' death.
Because the death was suspicious.
You both sound right.
What should I do?
Let's make a bet.
Here's an apple.
If you can stab into it with this dagger.
I'll let the case retrial.
Please think about it.
If you miss, you'll be killed.
Your Majesty, stop considering.
It's difficult to make it if we put it on the table.
Let's put it on my head.
Take care, You Majesty.
Take care of yourself.
You're really...
Loyal to me.
I'll let you replace my position to hold the apple.
Go ahead!
Ready?
Okay!
Your Majesty,
I'd like to have my eyes covered first.
You used to do it like this?
No, but the blood will make me sick.
Alright.
Come on!
I think the victim must be framed.
The case should go to court again.
I don't mean to force you.
Not at all.
Justice comes first.
Pao, come forward.
You're now appointed the supreme Judge.
You'll go with the Secretary and the Navy Commander.
To re-trial the case.
Panther, you'll guard Pao's life forever.
You're appointed as "Great Kung Fu Master".
Go now with Pao.
Thanks, You Majesty.
What rank is the Supreme Judge?
First.
Great!
Your Majesty, thanks very much.
I've tried my best, you should treat me out.
Let's go to the brothel.
Great!
It's time.
Chop.
Please forgive her.
Don't listen to him.
Chop.
Decree from the Majesty.
Stop chopping.
Take the criminal under custody.
Wait until Supreme Judge come and rejudge.
Mr. Pao.
"Fair and Justice"
Mr. Pao wants to prove Ms. Chi's innocence.
Go and give him a hand.
Dad, I will re-establish our reputation today.
What's wrong?
How come your face is so black?
Uncle wants to be tanned so as to look like Pao Ching.
Is that your idea?
Uncle, how come you're not tanned?
I had a mask with me.
I just need this mark.
How come you're so tanned?
I was trapped.
The murder case of the Chi's family, will be re-trailed by, three departments.
The most superior judge would be Pao Lung Sing.
And the Secretary of the judicial Department, Mr. Fa.
The Navy Commander, Mr. Shang and me.
Keep silence in court.
Today, no one's allowed to speak foul language.
You can't curse at each other's parents or mention any sex organ.
I should be granted special rights.
Alright, you can curse at other's mother only.
Damn your mother.
Uncle, you'll win for sure.
Dessert.
He's nothing special, except he uses a bigger desk.
We'll find a way to fight him.
Have a sip.
Don't worry.
Eunuch Lee supports us.
Try our best to beat him.
You'll get him.
- Your...
- What?
- Your Honour.
- What's wrong?
You shouldn't say so.
You shouldn't stare at me.
- What?
- You stared at me.
You stared at me first, so you knew I was staring at you.
I can call you slut, but you can't stare at me.
How dare you call me slut?
I'll report to His Majesty.
Slut...
You can't do this.
He's appointed by his Majesty.
Damn you mother.
You can't curse in court...
Damn you mother.
There's nothing to do with any mother.
Damn you mom.
You are slut!
I'm here to re-trial the case.
I did not ask you to speak yet.
You're tried to offend the Supreme Judge!
Tell me, are you slut?
You can't leave.
You claim yourself great?
Why did you step out?
What's your problem?
Do you want to play some tricks?
I came with other people for fun.
I just step out a bit.
Alright, I will step back.
Cut the crap, step back...
Stand behind the yellow line...
Stand...
So what?
So what?
Shit, I step forward again.
Shit, I step back again.
So what?
So what?
Are you going to beat me?
Alright!
You all heard... that he asked for it.
I've never seen any request like this.
Sir, we should question Chi first.
Mrs. Chi, what do you have to say?
We'll be fair.
Sir, it's all under you control.
My family was murdered, by Shang Wai,
and I was raped by him, too.
Summon Shang Wai.
Your Honours.
How did... her family die?
She killed them.
Summon the drugs store keeper and the coroner.
Your Honour.
Mr. Chu, from you last statement,
Mrs. Chi bought arsenic in you store, right?
Yes, Your Honour.
Coroner, and you testified that the dessert was poisoned, right?
Yes, Your Honour.
Look, here's some sugar and poison.
If we pour them in, it'll be too sticky.
Do you think anyone would want to eat this?
Maybe, the Chi's family was too stupid.
Would you like to try some?
It's wonderful, drink it, then you can fly.
Help...
You're stupid too, even you are not willing to drink it.
Don't you think the dead would be smarter than you?
Maybe she didn't use all those arsenic.
So where did the rest go?
I've searched all over didn't see any.
If she didn't need that much.
Why would she buy that much?
So the truth is... you lied!
I didn't lie, Your Honour.
Really?
We stole this account book from you.
Not many people buy arsenic.
And you only ordered half a catty of arsenic.
And yet and said you sold her a catty?
- Sir, I have a very bad memory.
- Bad Memory?
How about a few months ago... when you testified?
You always have poor memory.
- Great Kung-fu Master.
- Yes, Sir.
I asked you to examine the bodies, and what was the result?
Please turn around.
Your Honour, look.
Only the throats... turned black.
According to my experience.
Some one must have poured poisonous substance into their mouths.
So the poison didn't reach the stomach.
Every bodies had a serious fracture.
Their heads were put back together with nails.
I think the murderer must be an great master in Kung-fu.
Later, someone wanted to cover it.
Shang Wai, did you hear it?
Sir, I have something to say.
He just said... the killer knows Kung-fu.
Well.
But Mr. Shang doesn't know any Kung-fu.
So, how can you prove him to be the murderer?
Then why did we... arrest him in great effort?
I'm born to be strong.
Really?
Serve him with great punishment.
Yes.
If you don't resist, you'll suffer from the penalties.
If you resist, it means you know Kung-fu.
Eunuch Lee arrives.
God-father.
- Your Excellency.
- Buddy.
I come to hear... the trial.
I brought something for Wai, my God-son.
God-father.
Behave yourself.
If you commit any crime,
I'll punish you, too.
But if anyone wants to frame you.
I'll back you up.
Of course...
This is from the queen.
If you wear it, nobody is allowed to hit you, except the Emperor.
No one is allowed to hurt you.
Your Honour...
Uncle, we can't beat him, what'll we do?
How wise is he!
Maybe they were not... poisoned to death.
But Chi might have hired a killer to murder them.
The time reporter also saw Wai being beaten up, too.
We should punish Chi to make her confess.
Prepare the penalty.
You're so smart.
I admire your flattering ability.
Mr. Pao, what do you mean?
Nothing serious,
I'll say something else...
- You...
- Don't mention my mom.
Who mentioned to punish Chi?
Mr. Pao, you don't have to distract our attention.
- Prepare for the punishment.
- Yes.
Wait a moment.
Who is going to give order?
What?
Mr. Pao, you're very bureaucratic.
If we let you get promoted in future, you won't even respect the Empress Dowager.
Respect has a different meaning to me.
I respect His Highness from the bottom of my heart.
Unlike you who always talks... but not really respect her.
- You...
- You were not filial... to your mother, by becoming an eunuch.
You're not loyal because you don't respect the Empress Dowager.
So what would a damn sissy... guy sitting here for?
How dare you talk like this?
I'm the Supreme judge.
You're just a housekeeper... of the royal family.
I'm standing, how dare you sit there?
I must teach you about manners.
Okay, I'll report to His Majesty, and kill your...
Damn you father.
Go ahead if you think you can walk out of here.
Shut the door!
Release the dogs.
Mr. Pao...
I can handle this by myself.
Let's come back to the trial.
Alright.
Asshole.
- Who do you mean?
- Whoever answers me.
You bastard.
I'll ignore you.
You're maniac.
Damn you.
Go to hell...
Sissy asshole.
Your Honour.
Mr. Pao is dragging time, let's go threatening the witness.
- Go.
- Yes.
Isn't that the coroner?
How come he's beaten up like this?
He made a false testimony.
He took bribery and he framed that victim.
So Pao beated him up like this.
The drugs store keeper Chu Yee, was cut into two halves by Pao.
It hurts.
Help...
What are you doing?
It hurts.
I can't walk.
I can't move.
- Don't tell lies.
- Don't come close.
It hurts... help...
What are you doing?
Go away, help...
What are you doing down there?
I want to write the word "miserable".
I can't read.
Don't bother me.
I'm over.
It's your turn.
You have a rat face, eagle nose, elephant ears... yellow teeth, pig legs, big mouth... beary waist, and chicken chest.
If I were you, I would have committed suicide already.
- I...
- You took off your pants before sleep.
The marks of ass are all over your body.
Damn you...
Your Excellency, are you alright?
Come and take a seat.
Go to hell!
Why don't you punish her?
You've messed up for ages.
Are you delaying on purpose?
Of course not.
Go on.
Summon Loi Fook and the gynecologist.
Your Honour, we're willing to tell the truth.
One by one, let's question Mrs. Chi first.
It's not your turn yet.
Punish Chi first.
- I feel great pain.
- Are you pretending?
It hurts.
My baby is coming out.
She's acting.
Let's just go ahead to punish her.
Come on.
Wait, let's ask the gynecologist's opinion.
She'll know it after a check.
It hurts.
Sir, her baby is coming out.
What would you say?
I'm not the judge.
You'll decide it.
Let's vote.
If you think she should be punished now, hands up.
- Three to one!
Punish her!
- No way.
Everybody can vote here.
Hands up if you think she should have her baby laboured first.
Let her give birth...
Let her give birth...
Let her give birth...
What would you say?
We can't offend the public.
Let her have her baby laboured first.
Alright, Chi is permitted to have her baby laboured first.
- Be careful.
- It hurts...
There was something wrong with your testimony.
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth.
What did you really see on that day?
I...
I saw Shang Wai beating Loi Fook.
So the dog attacked Shang Wai.
But Shang kicked the dog to death.
Loi Fook got away and I tried to escape, too.
But Shang kicked me hard, and I fainted.
Why didn't you say this last time?
Because Mr. Fong gave me... 500 taels to make a false testimony.
Your Honour, please don't kill me.
Mind your tongue.
You mean everybody is lying?
Loi Fook, what did you see on that night?
I forgot.
Did you commit adultery with Chi?
Did she ask you to murder the whole family?
No, I only had affair with her.
You said Chi was very fond of you.
- She even wrote you a love poem, right?
- Yes!
Bring him the love poem.
Could you read it once again?
We are two of a kind.
Our love will last forever.
There're few words missing, right?
The is another poem, idiot.
What character is this?
Damn it.
You can't even read the word "Dead"!
Kill him.
How dare you frame her up?
Men, kill him now.
No, Your Honour, I am framed.
Fong gave me 5,000 tales... so as to frame Chi.
I still have 3,000 taels at home.
Bastard.
How dare you to betray me?
You did commit adultery.
Kill me, sir.
I have evidence.
I can't never have any affair with Chi.
I'll show you.
Show us them.
I was born in a poor family, so I castrated myself.
I wanted to be an eunuch, but I didn't have money to bribe the eunuch, so I failed.
Then I went to work for the Chi's family.
So I can't have any sex.
Another damn eunuch.
I don't mean you.
Alright.
Let's dismiss Fong's title first.
Then we'll trial him later.
What do you think?
Sure, whatever you say.
Fong!
You'd better tell the truth.
I'll consider a slight punishment if you turn to be stained witness.
Fong and Loi Fook are guilty of bribery, so they should be chopped to death.
You're so vicious.
How are you.
Slap him.
Uncle, they were seriously hurt.
So we don't have any witness now.
My son, I've brought the Royal Sword to you.
Mom, you...
Grandma, stop playing, we are busy.
Take the salted fish away.
This is not salted fish, it's real.
Royal Sword?
Uncle, make sure of it, may be...
It's really a Royal Sword.
Shang Wai, don't you think I couldn't beat you up?
In front of me, you could never tell lies.
I will chop your fingers off with my Sword.
Are you going to confess now?
Asshole, get lost.
My Sword is authorised to kill corrupted king and nasty official.
I don't want to hurt you.
Since the reign of Ching Dynasty,
I've never heard of Royal Sword.
What is this?
This is not common stuff, you don't know it of course.
Grandma, tell them!
Which Emperor granted this to our family?
This is granted by Emperor Sung-ching of Ming Dynasty.
Ming Dynasty?
You used Ming's sword to chop the official of Ching Dynasty?
You mean a rebellion?
In fact... the atmosphere is too tense, my mom and I just want to do something... to give you fun.
Don't you mind this?
If you swallow it, I will take this as fun.
Well, I will do it.
Thank you...
Now, it's alright.
Back to the trial.
Forget the things just happened.
If you don't show any evidence to accuse Shang Wai, you have to adjourn.
Then Wai will be a coquetted.
Hey, the baby is born, congratulations.
Stop messing up, decide it now.
Well, we have no choice but... test it with blood.
Blood test?
Right!
Scare him first!
Shang Wai you said you didn't rape the accused.
So her baby must have nothing to do with you.
So, your blood can't be matched with its blood.
If you take the blood test, you've chance to proof you're innocent.
If you don't take the test, you must be the murderer.
Go ahead.
I scare nothing.
It's matched, you must be the murderer.
You'd have raped her and then killed her family.
You'd not deny.
Men, prepare the guillotine.
Impossible...
God-father, the kid is not mine.
It is not mine.
God-father...
- I am here, don't panic.
- You have to help me...
If you were not the adulator, why the blood matches each other?
That must be your kid, you can never explain.
He is not my kid.
I screwed her that night, how can she get pregnant on the next day?
Oh, you screwed her!
You beast, how dare you cheat me?
Are you happy?
Here is the truth.
I won't take care of you.
Please give way.
Mister, how are you?
Honey, why are you here?
It's you and father-in-law who asked me to come.
That's my son?
You mean, he is my son?
You bastard!
How dare you trick me?
So what?
Stop talking to him.
Shut the door and let the dogs out.
I won't care about you, I am leaving.
God-father...
Don't come over.
Bastard, do you want to rebel?
You said you didn't know Kung-fu, now you confess again.
Stand back.
I'll kill him.
Eunuch Li, thank you for sacrificing yourself.
I will report to His Majesty and give you a great funeral.
Open the door, let the dogs out.
Don't come over.
Panther, throw him here.
Sir, it's me.
I've seen it, go out and fight again, great Kung-fu master.
You dragged me to death.
Do you believe I would kick you to death?
Please, would you don't swing the car?
I will have care sick.
Congratulations...
Thank you.
I am not longer official.
Why do you open a drugs store... and quit you post?
I can't explain to you for you are too stupid.
Look at your sister and Yu Yin.
Honey.
Be careful, have a kiss.
Mrs. Pao.
I've given Mr. Pao... the hereditary nostrum.
After taking the medicine, he was capable to have two sons.
Now he is going to use this in business.
"India's miraculous cure"
From India.
I could have such great achievements is all because of His Majesty.
I miss him so much.
Luckily, I have his underwear as my collection.
I feel great after smelling it.
I gives me strength.
It's of good taste too.
Don't miss it.
Prince Tin has arrived.
Welcome...
Mr. Pao, I could send you any congratulations.
But I've to tell you a bad news.
His Majesty passed away.
His Majesty...
What's wrong with it?
Why?
- Sickness.
- What sickness?
It is...
Syphilis!
Hey!
Oof!
Whew, I better cut out the chocolate

Then I had this really strange dream, where my mom was telling me:
"Come to Dragon's Nest.
Come to Dragon's Nest."
"Dragon's Nest"?
It's were all the lady dragons go
Nicole, access dragon behavior.
Emphasis on migration
Searching, Sally
One area found
Onset of migrational pattern behavior during adolescence
Onset of what during who?
Display, Nicole
During adolescence, dragons enter a trance like state which draws them to their nesting ground
Although only adult dragons lay eggs, adolescents have survival patterning which draws them to dragons nest and-
D'oh!
Wait a Sonic-second!
Can we do this in english?
Dulcy has dreams that tell her to go to Dragon's Nest, their nesting place
Got it
May I continue?
Please
Dragon's Nest is located in Deep Canyon which is the nesting area where adult females lay there eggs.
Oooh, Dragon's Nest!
Of course that's where the dragon was headed
The very cradle of their civilization
I think it's time for the cradle to fall!
Ready my command ship, Snively.
It's Dragon hunting season
Nicole, can you monitor dream sleep frequencies?

Well, isn't she just cuter than a chipmunk's cheeks?
Aww...

Good girl!
Now, ease up a little!
Oh!
That was wonderful!

How do I know?
I don't even know how I got here
It can't be yours Dulcy, you're too young.
That other dragon?
What other dragon?
Okay, Ma!
I got it know!
Dulcy, I sorry but we can't stay here!
Robotnik captured the mother and I think he's still looking for you!
But
- But when the egg hatches, the baby's gonna need her milk!
Well, how long before it hatches?
Soon...
Now tell me, how many dragons are left and how many females with powers!
?
I know of no other dragons, Robotnik.
You have us all now
You're lying!
There are still more out there.
I can feel them
I hope you're right
Snively!

Yes sir!
I thought this was you, but I was mistaken
This one remains free and she has the powers!
Now how do I find her?
Even if I knew, Robotnik, I would never tell you!
Very well...
Send her to the Roboticizer!
Hedgehogs don't do this stuff Sal!

Good luck Bunnie
Nice egg.
That's it-
Yo, unc'!

He's moving her to the dragon Roboticizer
Well, where's that?
He'll take this route, I'll set up right here

Dulcy, your mother would be proud
We'll meet again.
You'll know the time
Good luck!
Ahem!

Here they come.
Then I had this really strange dream, where my mom was telling me:
"Come to Dragon's Nest!"
"Come to Dragon's Nest!"
Dragon's Nest?
It's where all the lady dragons go.
Nicole, access "dragon behavior"!
Emphasis on "migration".
Searching, Sally.
One area found.
Onset of migrational pattern behavior during adolescence.
Onset of what during who?
Display, Nicole!
During adolescence dragons enter a trance like state, which draws them to their nesting ground.
Although only adult dragons lay eggs, adolescents have survival patterning which draws them to Dragon's Nest and-
Wait a Sonic-second!
Can we do this in English?
Dulcy has dreams that tell her to go to Dragon's Nest, their nesting place.
Got it.
May I continue?
Please!
Dragon's Nest is located in Deep Canyon which is the nesting area where adult females lay their eggs.
Oh, Dragon's Nest!
Of course that's where the dragon was headed.
The very cradle of their civilization.
I think it's time for the cradle to fall!
Ready my command ship, Snively!
It's dragon hunting season.
Nicole, can you monitor dream sleep frequencies?
Generating frequency sensitive hologram.
Well, isn't she just cuter than a chipmunk's cheeks?
- Look at that!
- Oh my baby.
My bab-
Now more right wing, Dulcy!
Okay, mom!
Good girl!
Good girl!
Now ease up a little!
That was wonderful!
Good, Dulcy!
Very, very good.
I don't like it, mom.
All my friends laugh at me when I do this.
Oh, Dulcy, don't mind them!
Just remember that you are special.
Oh, boy!
It's time!
Woah!
Dulce!
Wait a second!
Out of the way, Sonic!
I gotta go!
Hey, we all gotta go sometime.
Just chill a minute!
Okay, what?
Dulcy!
We know what's happening to you.
Then you understand why I've got to go.
"Warn Dulcy!
Robotnik on route to Dragon's Nest."
Activate camouflage!
Activating, sir!
No sign of her.
I had no clue she could crank like that.
Better slap me some power, Sal!
Way cool!
Dust and bust time!
Mondo huge!
Where to?
The top.
Why did I know that?
Grab your socks, were hitting the rocks!
Oh, no!
Sonic!
Sal, we're too late.
Oh my gosh, is that Dulcy?
No way!
It's Dulcy.
I don't get it.
Is this my egg?
What am I supposed to do, fry it?
I was just kidding, okay?
Don't have a cow.
I got it!
Yo, Dulce!
Who's is that?
How do I know?
I don't even know how I got here.
It can't be yours, Dulcy, you're too young.
That other dragon?
What other dragon?
Okay, ma!
I got it know!
Dulcy, I'm sorry but we can't stay here.
Robotnik captured the mother and I think he's still looking for you.
But when the egg hatches, the baby's gonna need her milk.
Well, how long before it hatches?
Soon.
Now, tell me, how many dragons are left, and how many females with powers?
I know of no other dragons, Robotnik.
You have us all now.
You're lying!
There are still more out there.
I can feel them.
I hope you're right.
Snively, play the surveillance tape!
Yes, sir.
I thought this was you, but...
I was mistaken.
This one remains free and she has the powers.
Now how do I find her?
Even if I knew, Robotnik,
I would never tell you!
Very well.
Send her to the Roboticizer!
Hedgehogs don't do this stuff, Sal.
It's embarrassing.
Alright, Sonic.
I'll take over.
You're a princess, Sal!
Well, well.
A three for one sell.
The fates are smiling.
Prepare the force field net!
I want them alive and well!
Yo, Dulce!
Better crank!
Bald company coming.
Going down!
Cool moves, Dulce!
He's not getting this egg.
No way!
Sonic!
Dulcy!
Target off radar, sir.
Then find it!
A dragon can't just disappear!
Hang on, Sally!
We're going home.
Incredible.
Serious.
Dulcy, you made a perfect landing!
Sure.
I was carrying an egg.
Cool!
So, what happens if it hatches?
Bunnie, just make sure it doesn't fly away!
But when are y'all coming back?
Soon as we find the mother.
Good luck, Bunnie!
Nice egg.
That's it...
Yo, Unc!
Robotnik's back.
What about the mother dragon?
He's moving her to the Dragon Roboticizer.
Well, where's that?
He'll take this route,
I'll set up right here.
How much time?
Ten minutes.
E.T.A. 90 seconds, sir.
No sign of the hedgehog or the dragon.
Patience, Snively!
They'll be here.
Alert the backup unit!
Unit 2 approaching your position.
Roger.
Standing by.
Yes!
Swat-cicles!
Nice work, Dulcy!
Good luck!
You too!
I love a parade.
The hedgehog, sir!
I have the control, Snively.
Switch to automatic tracking!
Activate workerbots!
It's working.
Have units 2 and 3 stand by!
Yo, Robuttnik!
Give it your best shot!
Right there is perfect, hedgehog.
Just where I want you.
Snively?
Units 2 and 3, attack!
Repeat, units 2 and 3, attack!
A rag top, cool!
Snively!
Unit 2, attack!
Why is he just standing there, Snively?
That's why, sir.
Oh, no!
Nice flying, Sal!
Uh-oh, trouble.
Next time you won't have back up.
You'll be mine!
Sonic, let's go!
Oh my stars!
It won't be long now.
Aw.
Look at that!
It's cracking.
Oh, look at this!
She's so cute.
She's a protector.
The fate of all dragons rests on her, and the other protector,
Dulcy.
Thank you all!
We won't forget you.
Oh, you're so welcome.
But don't you want to rest?
No, Sally.
It's too dangerous here.
I know a place where even Robotnik won't find us.
Dulcy, your mother would be proud.
We'll meet again.
You'll know the time.
Good luck!
I made you a little present, Dulcy.
For me?
- Wow, what is it?
- Open it!
Knee pads.
I thought maybe you could use them.
Thanks, Rotor!
Purple's my favorite color.
Well, it was either that or carpet the meadow.
[Child's laughter]
So whose turn is it tonight?
Girl:
Tucker.
Where is your sweet little bro?
You mean he isn't here yet?
I knew that little puke was gonna be trouble.
Don't worry.
He's here.
[Cell phone rings]
[Ring]
Am I missing something?
[Ring]
[Ring]
Tucker?
Yeah.
We're all set.
OK.
[Beep]
Go.
Can everybody hear me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
OK.
I'm telling my story this way, 'cause if you think about it, a telephone is probably the scariest thing in your house.
Boy:
Say what?
You might feel safe with your doors and windows locked, but all someone has to do is dial your number.
You answer the phone, and bingo, they're inside.
But it's just their voice.
Yeah, but when you pick up that phone, you made a connection, and it might be to a place that you don't want to be connected to.
Do you have the pouch?
All set.
Submitted for the approval of the Midnight Society,
I call this story...
TheTaleof thePhonePolice.
[Footsteps]
Man:
Hello?
You go.
What are you scared of?
Woman:
Hello?
Yeah, uh...
Hello.
This is the acme appliance company.
Is your refrigerator running?
Yeah.
You better run after it before it gets away.
Lame.
Very lame.
Listen and learn, my friend.
Woman:
Hello?
And hello to you, ma'am!
This is radio station kzit--k-zit-- and you have just been selected to be one of our lucky contestants.
Now, to qualify for an all-expense-paid dream vacation, all you have to do is answer one easy question.
Woman:
What kind of question?
Listen carefully.
In centimeters, exactly how wide is Antarctica?
You have 10 seconds.
Come on, Jake.
It's not funny.
Hurry, ma'am.
Don't let this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity slip away.
Oh, dear!
I--I--I really don't know.
You have 4... 3... 2...1...
Caught ya!
What are you doing?
No, what are you doing, making crank calls again?
No.
I was trying to get Mum and Dad.
Look, pal,
I'm in charge here while they're on vacation, so stop acting like a little wart!
I can't believe you're letting him talk you into this stuff.
You're not gonna tell Mum and Dad, are you?
Forget Mum and Dad.
You're gonna get tagged by the Phone Police, you zero.
Phone Police?
What are the Phone Police?
You're kidding, right?
You've never heard of the Phone Police?
Uh... no.
Well, the phone has certain rules of operation.
You don't leave it off the hook.
You don't let it ring too long, and you don't make stupid calls like my blunt little brother.
She's making this up.
You think so, eh?
Oh.
Keep messing with the phone, and you'll end up like the Baxter kid.
Who's the Baxter kid?
Billy Baxter.
Happened a long time ago.
He was making crank calls, and the Phone Police got him.
Oh, gimme a break!
It's true.
They never saw him again.
How do you know all this?
Hmph.
Everybody knows about the Baxter kid, except you, my vacant sibling.
Ha.
You mess with the phone, you answer to the Phone Police.
Wanna make a call?
I gotta go.
Good thing one of you guys has some brains.
Chris, you don't believe that stuff, do you?
It doesn't matter.
It's no fun, anyway.
See you tomorrow.
Chris.
The Phone Police.
Yeah, right.
Stupid.
"A...
Amis...
Angelo.
"B.
"Ben.
Billy Baxter"?
It's only got 6 numbers.
This won't work.
Hello?
[Static] Man:
Help me.
Someone, please!
Help--
[telephone rings]
[Ring]
Hello?
[Static] Man:
Hey, kid.
I know you can hear me.
You gotta help me, please--

Who are you?
What do you want?
Man:
You know who I am.
You called me.
It's Billy Baxter.
You've gotta help me.
[Ring]
Please help me!
[Ring]
Please!
[Static]
It musta been Annie.
It musta been Annie pulling your chain.
It was unplugged, Chris.
How could she make it ring?
I don't know.
Maybe it was a dream.
[Telephone rings]
Can't be!
[Ring]
So answer it.
No way!
You answer it.
[Ring]
[Ring]
Hello?
That guy last night, did he sound like this?
[Static] Help!
You gotta get me out!
Lose this!
We gotta do something.
Number1-1-8 to maintenance.
Number1-1-8to maintenance.
Ahem.
Excuse me.
Yes.
How can we find out where this number comes from?
There's only 6 numbers, and we thought it was foreign or something.
It's not foreign.
It's old and discontinued.
It can't be.
We just called it and got somebody.
You called this number and got an answer?
Well, sorta.
It was more like static, but someone was there.
Then they started calling me back.
The records department is in the basement.
They'll take care of you.
Thanks.
Number12, call 4-2-2-9.
4-2-2-9.
Now what?
There.
[Ding]
[Door closes]
Where's the number?
Yeah?
What can I do for you?
The lady upstairs said you could tell us who has this number.
Hmm.
I see.
Ha.
We don't get very many of these nowadays.
Come on back.
Using the phone to tell a couple of jokes, eh?
What?
Just stand there, young fella.
We'll take care of ya.
[Whispers] What's goin' on?
[Footsteps approaching]
Jake O'Brian.
Phone Police.
What?
!
Hey!
[Muffled screams]
Hey!
Lemme outta here!
What is this?
You'll figure it out.
I know, 'cause you're a real smart kid!
You got here quicker than anyone ever has!
[Menacingly] Ha ha ha ha ha!
Help!
Chris!
Somebody help!
[Telephone rings]
[Ring]
Hello?
[Static] Don't bother shouting.
No one can hear you.
I know.
I've tried.
Who is this?
Have you forgotten already?
It's Billy Baxter.
Oh, man, what is this place?
Why am I here?
You never should have messed with the phone.
Now they've got you.
No!
I'm gonna call my parents.
Not on that phone.
It only takes incoming calls.
But you called me.
That's 'cause you called me first.
Maybe you'll be lucky.
Stay on the phone.
Someone might hear you someday.
Ha ha ha!
Wait!
Don't hang up.
[Dial tone]
Yeah, yeah.
Hang on.
Annie, Annie!
They got Jake!
Just like you said!
It's the Phone Police!
We went down to the phone company--
Who are you, and how do you know my name?
What?
It's me!
Get out of here before I phone the police.
It's me, Chris, Jake's friend.
They got him.
I don't know you, and I don't know any Jake.
I'm calling the cops.
Wait!
Jake's your brother!
What is with you?
Look, I don't have any brother, OK?
Now get outta here!
You're not kidding, are you?
No, I'm not kidding!
I'll bean you!
Hey!
I'll prove it to you...
This is Jake's bed... room.
Are you gonna get out, or do I call the cops?
The cops.
Yeah.
You told us a story about the Phone Police and a kid named Billy Baxter.
You know the story?
Yeah, I know it.
Except the way I heard it, they got a kid named O'Brian, a Jake O'Brian.
Jake O'Brian?
No!
Let me go!
Lemme go!
I didn't do anything.
I swear it was just a joke!
Nobody got hurt!
Oh, man!
Those guys work fast.
[Ring]
Leave me alone, you crazy old--
Jake, take it easy.
It's me.
Chris!
Get me outta here, man!
This place is nuts.
I didn't do anything wrong!
You gotta help me!
Whoa!
Calm down.
Get Annie!
Get my parents!
Uh...
I can't do that, Jake.
Why not?
You gotta do something, or I'll be stuck here forever.
This whole thing is weirder than you even know.
I'm scared, Chris.
Me, too.
But I got a plan.
Maybe we can beat the phone police at their own game.
[Telephone rings]

That's it!
You've had it!

Aah!
Let's get outta here!
[Ring]
Forget it, kid!
No one gets away from the Phone Police!
Wait.
Come on!
[Slam]
No!
This way.
Oh, man!
They're all over the place.
There they are!
This way.
We're dead!
We're not giving up now.
Yes!
We got it!
We're outta here.
We're-- trapped.
There!
Now where did they--
OK.
Coast is clear.
Come on.
[Siren]
Thanks, man.
I'm glad to be outta there.
[Wheels screech]
Run!
We made it.
You saved me, man.
OK.
Listen.
I gotta tell you something.
After you got caught,
I went to your house, and--aah!
What's wrong with you guys?
This is Jake, Annie, your brother.
You gotta remember him now.
Where do you get these friends from, Jake.
Do you, uh, order them from the back of comics?
You remember him?
You know who he is?
Yeah.
In fact, I'd like to forget him if I could.
I don't believe this.
Jake, your room's back to normal.
What are you two yams talking about?
[Doorbell] Don't answer it!
You two are losin' it.
Annie, don't!
It's the Phone Police.
Phone Police?
Airhead, I made that up.
But it's true!
They got me.
Yeah, I wish.
Ha.
Pizza.
One jumbo, extra cheese, all dressed, hold the anchovies.
Did you guys order a pizza?
Oh, jeez, sorry.
It's 238, not 328.
Night.
I can't believe you guys bought that story about the Phone Police.
Talk about gullible.
I'm gonna lie down.
I'm exhausted.
It did happen, though, didn't it?
[Ring]
[Ring]
Man:
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Jake and Chris never made another crank call 'cause they were never sure if the Phone Police were really real, or if they could believe anything else they ever saw... again.
The end!
[Laughter]
Excellent, Tucker.
The.
Great story, Tuck.
Great story.
I declare this meeting of the Midnight Society closed.
[Ring]
[Together] I'll get it!

Long ago, when the line between Good and Evil was clearly drawn twin brothers faced each other in battle.
Good was triumphant, and the Knight buried his brother.
Now, a thousand years later, the struggle continuous.
THE WANDERER
Episode 7 "NO BULL"
What does my twin want from you, Hermit?
He wants your memory, Knight.
How long you've been standing there?
About two cycles.
Marvelous aid to the meditative process...
your modern front loader.
For instance I get the definite impression that you have added to your burden.
I killed two men.
That you did.
Justly too, me thinks.
Justly or unjustly.
I don't wanna have to go about hurting people all the time.
Well, there is always Arnold.
Who is Arnold?
The ancient and noble art of Arnold originating it is said out of the mists of time on the "Wrestling Associations Handbook".
Meet Arnold.
And I can show you one or two spots, here and there, which if you press you can cut off Arnold's motor.
Okay.
Nah.
- There?
- Harder!
Much harder!
Here.
I'm never gonna get this.
Godbold!
Are we playing hide-and-seek?
I can smell your perfume.
A gift or a warning?
A gift and the warning.
Thank you, my lady.
Don't be shy.
Let's have a look at you.
Clare!
I tried to forget you, not to follow you.
- Dammit, Clare!
- It didn't work.
- With everything that's happened.
- Because of everything that's happened.
And could happen.
You know you're in danger while you anywhere near me.
I don't care!
Do you ever stop to wander?
How you were able to find me?
You're wasting your breath.
I won't leave you!
- Oh.
We can't argue here.
- Wrong.
I can argue anywhere.
What's that?
It's a melon.
What do you think it is?
- Well.
You can't stay here.
- I can stay where I like.
Well, stay.
This is quiet a nice little spot for you.
Well, it went well.
Take it up!
Get up!
This is the place.
Oh no!
- Where is everyone?
- Probably staying outta the sun.
Like you should be doing in your short little sports car going in the opposite direction home.
It's a nice place.
That's strange, don't you think?
You have trouble staying on the subject, don't you, Clare?
Is something bothering you?
This is where it'll happen.
What?
Have no idea.
Well, you're not gonna send me home without lunch.
Lunch.
And then you leave.
Maybe.
A siesta.
I don't think they get many tourists.
I wish that's all we were.
Tourists.
Gracias!
Nothing but... time for each other.
Thousand years of history.
I don't even know if you like ketchup on your French Fries.
What do you think about Carpaccio?
Have you been in "Weightwatchers"?
It's a silly question.
Lunch, then you leave.
I won't.
You know I won't.
You're not trying.
You're not trying to hurt.
Come on!
Come on!
Yes!
Much better!
Much better!
That's it!
Come on!
I like you.
You have spirit.
Always leave them wanting more.
Just keep driving into the faraway.
Then call me and I'll join you.
You won't!
You avoid me.
I promise.
Something is brewing here, isn't it?
And you are trying to avoid it because of me.
You can't avoid fate.
Neither of us can.
That's why we are here.
Someone wanted you to find me.
And wanted us both here.
It's way too easy.
I want us both here.
We belong together.
- This place gets stranger by the minute.
- Just a local festival.
But we are the only audience.
Looks that way.
My son!
Oh my son!
You shouldn't come here.
I begged you not to.
Can I not?
When are you coming home?
Let's not start that again, please.
Leave these people!
They're changing you!
They're destroying you.
You even look at your mother now as if she's the enemy.
Leave me along, mother.
I'm fine.
I'm with my friends.
What kind of friends won't allow you to return home?
Go home!
You're wasting your time here.
I made my mother crying account of you.
Not the first time, I bet.
You were the biggie.
- Where are you going?
- She needs help.
What are your parents make of you?
- They think I'm headstrong.
- I can't see why?
We ain't gonna get long, just fine.
Enter.
- Well...?
- They're in the square.
- All of them?
- All of them.
Excellence is becoming quite a pleasant day.
- How long have you been in my service?
- Since 1509th, sir.
I thought I'd recognised the older style.
You can't get the staff these days.
Off you go then.
Lower!
I don't know how long I'll be staying.
But I need a room.
She's staying.
What all the problem is?
Whatever it is, she's gonna put up a fight.
Why don't I talk to her first?
Woman to woman.
You wait outside.
She might tell you remind her own business.
Not, that it'll make any difference.
Excuse me.
Is everything alright?
- Went according to plan?
- Yes, they were watching.
They saw you arguing with her?
Yeah.
- And they saw you leave?
- Yes.
You left her weeping?
Yes.
Very touching irresistible, I should think.
Newer could resist a tear.
I shall drown him in sentiment before we are finished.
You're fitting in?
You're happy with us?
Yes.
Good-good.
You will help me?
You think, you can help me?
I can try.
We'll help you.
My son is lost to me.
Ever since he met these people, he's... changed.
I can hardly recognise him.
All the tears I used to see in his eyes are no longer there.
Now there's only dullness or fear.
I know what you mean.
Who are these people?
They claim to be a "Bullfighting School".
We thought at first that it was all quite normal.
It wasn't what we wanted for him.
He was at university reading law.
Now his father has given up.
Lost hope.
And patience.
I can see how the move from...
law to bullfighting would shock most parents.
But it's not exactly sinister.
Many young men has dreamed of glory.
No.
I've seen the changes its made in my son.
Excuse me.
She's finally asleep.
But the dreams are bad.
Now what?
Guess I'll take a look at that "Bullfighting School".
You're not convinced?
You felt something early, didn't you?
Could be just a worried mother's fever imagination.
- I'm coming with you.
- No.
No need for that.
- I don't expect to find anything.
- Lair.
You gotta find me right by your side for a start.
You don't give up easy, do you?
After you.
They're on their way.
- Maybe she was right.
- What is it?
What kind of school needs sentries?
- Well, we're going in anyway.
- I'm going in.
You stay here.
You're kinda old-fashioned, aren't you?
Haven't you ever heard of women's lib?
Women's lib?
Doesn't ring a bell at all.
Come on.
Keep down.
When are we gonna be able to just do ordinary things?
- Enjoy ourselves!
- Ordinary things?
What an ordinary things?
What?
Like this?
Yes.
Oh yes!
And this?
That's so beautiful.
And this?
Yeah.
And this?
Well, something like this.
And this?
Hey, there!
What are you doing?
My legs!
I can't move my legs!
It's tiny pressure point.
You'll get to use back in a few moments.
Oh, you're swine!
And when you get used back in those pretty legs you get them to take you to the hotel.
Where you'll wait... um... for me.
I'll catch you for this.
The hotel.
How's that...?
Neck...
Strafe as argument.
Oh, I love the Spain, it's a lovely here.
Ah!
Hola!
Senores!
I'm so happy here!
Oh, it's smoking.
That is very bad.
It is very dangerous.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm drunk too much.
Silly of me.
One out of two.
Not bad.
Gotta spend a little more time with Arnold.
Come on!
Okay.
Okay.
Excuse me senor!
But I need your belt.
I see you too met the "deadly digit".
Bait taken!
My young man played that very convincingly.
The beating was real.
He hadn't much choice, had he?
Whereas this...
Ta-dam!
This is acting scale.
My God, Beatrice.
If the things we do in pursuit of Evil, why don't you just morph?
I can't do it at the moment.
No wonder, you're using too much energy being jealous of Clare.
She makes me sick.
I'll make you a sick if you start loosing your grip force, teeth, and wings.
You meant to be a precision instrument of the Evil, not some pantomime dame.
My performance was wonderful!
Would you believe I'm suddenly stuck here with "good old cranky".
- They were going to kill me tonight.
- Why?
Well, they no longer trust me.
They think my mother may have influenced me.
- There.
- They think I want to escape.
A once in, there is no escape.
Nice people.
Stay here!
Alright.
I should have guessed.
Why aren't you in the hotel with his mother?
- She is not at the hotel.
- Where is she?
She was heading for the bullring.
Probably looking for you.
- What happened to you?
- His mother was right.
Why would they do this?
I'm gonna find out.
There must to be another way into the bullring.
- There has to be.
- There is.
Yeah?
Alright.
You get back to the hotel.
No.
I won't!
Oh, not again!
You get back to the hotel and you wait for me there.
- I don't have a choice, do I?
- No, you don't.
- She is very beautiful!
- Really?
I hadn't noticed.
We'll go now?
No, we'll wait till night.
Come on!
It don't hurtle, d' you know.
If they'll give me the chance...
Then let's sue that they'll not.
Don't worry, we'll find your mother.
Come on!
I wasn't thinking about my mother.
It's going wrong!
Your young man swooning like some lovelorn schoolboy of that pasty-faced princess.
Sickening to watch!
It's the stone influencing our boy blocking our plans throwing all this sugar generated by our lovebirds.
I told you so: your twin, the stone, now the girl.
Didn't I say, his strength will grow now?
He is getting too strong.
Much you seise it.
All these dark and brooding manners.
If it's not gonna trigger some damn memory flash.
So much for subtlety.
Let's just steal his stone instead.
Oh.
I was just coming for you.
Come with me.
They're going to kill them.
At this way.
Come on.
It's time.
What's in the case?
Family jewels.
Let's go.
- So, it's Zachary.
- Yes, it's Zachary.
- He's got your mother.
- Perhaps we shouldn't go rushing in.
Come on.
He'll kill her.
She's not really my mother.
- Are they coming?
- I can hear them coming.
I wish I get and move on.
This stage is very badly sprung.
My God.
It's killing me.
Here they come.
I think we've got him.
By Jove, we've got him.
Well done, lad!
Greetings, twin!
You've met Beatrice?
Yes of course.
Well...
This seems like a little reunion.
I must say I feel remarkably good about things.
You're weird, brother.
Do you like that, twin?
I thought Beatrice and I were splendid.
We so glad you can join us.
We have plans for you.
What do you want?
You're looking well, brother.
A little tense, but...
reasonably well.
We'll soon change that.
Forgive the melodrama.
Purely cosmetic.
Thought it might just conjure up something from the past.
- No?
- No.
No?
And never mind.
Bring me his case.
The stone in the sword.
I want... your stone.
I want its power.
It seems you have it.
Hm, I do, don't I?
It's not quite so simple, is it?
It seems...
I need you to give it to me.
Then you're in trouble.
You refuse to make the gift?
O-o-ow.
I think we might be able to persuade you.
Think brother.
Surely you remember my last little flirtation with your lady.
Surrender!
No!
You betrayed him.
What did he ever see in you?
You have a surface beauty.
You lack my depth.
- Of Evil.
- If you like.
Depth, nonetheless.
Stop her!
Stop him!
What're you doing?
Get him!
Clare!
Adam!
Let's go!
Don't shoot him, I need his gift!
Get him!
Get him!
Get him!
Would they kill us?
Not even I can help it - would.
Get down!
Oh good.
Okay.
We're trapped!
Poor confused pup.
Gotta crush, have we?
Don't think for a moment that Mommy doesn't understand.
Believe me.
I'm all for crushing that cow.
- Adam!
- Clare!
No!
Back so soon?
That's enough!
Stop there!
Are you ready with my gift, brother?
And then what?
You'll go free!
Diminished in power, but free.
Remember, you have my grave to find.
And Clare?
God, he drives a hard bargain!
Right, done.
And Clare.
Hand him the sword.
- Nothing tricky, brother.
- Don't trust him!
I don't have any choice, do I?
There, far enough!
Throw it.
Get him!
Don't let him get away!
Get him!
Get him!
Oh no, you don't!
Find him!
Oh, I've got her!
This way!
Stop, you idiot!
Zachary!
Where are you going?
Get soldiers!
Nobody can leave the ring!
- What are you doing?
- Lock every exit!
Zachary!
You!
Find my brother.
Bring him to me.
Get him!
- And what about Clare?
- Do it, Beatrice!
But don't hurt her until I'll get back.
- Here.
- You frighteningly good at Evil.
It runs in the family.
She must have a very small head.
Adam, Clare!
This way!
He can't had got away!
Find him!
Get round!
Get round!
Watch him, he's a tricky.
Come on!
Out Adam!
It's me, you stupid woman!
He did something to my shoulders!
You've let them get away!
You stupid...
You let them get away!
Beatrice!
Beatrice!
Beatrice!
We've got the stone!
You should have listened to your mother and become a lawyer.
Well, Zachary is not without charm.
I know.
I liked him once but...
I couldn't do the things he required of me.
He was attracted to the Good in you.
A challenge.
- Something to destroy.
- Yeah.
Well, I must go.
Yeah well, off you go then.
Go and find the better life.
It's waiting for you.
- And good luck.
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Don't you start that again.
Trust me.
People die around you, don't they?
I now understand.
Just be careful.
'Cause now you don't even have the stone to protect you.
I will.
Don't worry.
I thought we'd never see the dawn.
We'd have been near anyway.
'Cause it's thing about the life.
It's not extinguishable...

Excuse me, I'm looking for Ambassador Delenn.
- Could you tell me where to find her?
- Of course.
This way.
- Shuttle 1 is ready.
- Any more seismic disturbances?
We're still picking up rumbles from further down.
I wouldn't bother, but we're in orbit.
- Best to check it out, just to be sure.
- Agreed.
- Shuttle 1, begin geological survey.
- Confirmed.
Initiating launch.
I have to go.
Let me know when the team is back.
Will do.
- Ms. Winters.
- Hello, commander.
- Problem with the transport tube?
- No, not really.
Every time I get into the tube, Garibaldi's there, like he knows.
Mr. Garibaldi is many things, but he's not omniscient.
- I think I'll take the stairs.
- I think I'll join you.
Range to surface, 40 miles.
Close enough.
Activate scanners, set for maximum depth.
Let's see what's going on underneath.
What the hell was that?
!
- We've lost power.
Get it back.
- I can't, I have no controls here!
It was the dawn of the Third Age of mankind 10 years after the Earth-Minbari War.
The Babylon Project was a dream given form.
Its goal: to prevent another war by creating a place where humans and aliens could work out their differences.
It's a port of call, home away from home for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs and wanderers.
Humans and aliens, wrapped in 2,500,000 tons of spinning metal, all alone in the night.
It can be a dangerous place.
But it's our last, best hope for peace.
This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations.
The year is 2258.
The name of the place is Babylon 5.
Babylon Control to Shuttle 1.
Shuttle 1, do you receive?
Confirmed, we're receiving you.
All of our readouts blacked out.
Same here.
It was some kind of massive power surge, right off the scale.
Knocked half our systems out.
It came from inside the planet.
- What's your situation?
- Controls are fried.
We've achieved orbit, but we can't make it back.
- Can you send someone?
- Confirmed.
We'll send two starfuries ASAP.
Don't go anywhere.
Don't go anywhere?
As if we could.
Okay, we've got a while to wait.
Who's got a deck of cards?
- You're sure they're all right?
- They're shaken, but fine.
- They'll be back in a few hours.
- Good.
And find out what's going on.
- Sorry.
- It's quite all right.
An interesting riddle.
I thought the planet was uninhabited.
None of our surveys found signs of life down there.
Perhaps in the past, someone might have lived down there.
If that's true, you may have awakened something.
Perhaps.
We'll know more later.
Now, as far as these new trade routes are concerned....
Babylon, this is Delta Leader.
We have retrieved shuttle crew and are returning to Cobra Bay.
I want all the equipment loaded:
spectral analysis, thermal probes.
- We'll reconvene tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.
- Dr. Tasaki!
- Lieutenant commander.
- What was that?
- I have no idea.
We were told the planet was safe and uninhabited.
- Now it appears it isn't.
- Incorrect.
We don't know if anyone's alive there.
The seismic activity could've triggered an automatic system.
- We'll know more once we go back.
- What are you going to do?
Process the data collected from the power burst then call my wife.
She loves mysteries.
- This doesn't worry you?
- It scares the hell out of me.
But, what better way to go out than in the cause of scientific knowledge?
Is this a multiple-choice question?
Because I have some ideas.
We will release our trade routes to Sector 119 provided that our ships are allowed free use of the Centauri jumpgate.
- You drive a very hard bargain.
- It's a fair deal.
Your government stands to profit substantially.
The jumpgate fees are pocket change.
What I consider a tent, you consider a pocket.
But you are right.
It is a reasonable demand.
Done and done.
I will have my government issue an agreement by... when?
Tomorrow this time?
