-Almas kettle!
He should have a book to read.
Get rid of the cane.
Give it here.
Alma should have a kettle.
No, without the tray.
Like that, Yes.
And a coffee cup as well.
-With any coffee inside?
-Leave it for now.
You can wear it in your sleeve.
I'll fix it later.
This is complicated.
I have to think.
Let's begin over here.
He should have a book.
Find him a book.
12 Actors in a very individual and detailed activity.
When she's here...
You'll open the door.
And you let out the Doctor.
Lydia is still inside.
And dr Fürstenberg comes out.
You have met already.
Just nod your head discreetly.
It's just been an hour or so.
Start moving over here...
You may take her hand.
Like that, yes.
Then approach the people here.
That's when you come out.
You walk...
Wait!
And you enter the other room.
You're confused.
Stand here and look around you.
Then walk back to the room again, and lock the door after you.
You stand up.
Just to hear what he has to say.
That's when you come forth and offer him coffee.
You pour it, but remain in this position overhearing their chat.
Then we need a sign for Lydia to come out.
She is crying.
Big time.
You run...
Pass them like this.
Once more, Gunn.
That's it.
We'll fix that later.
Go ahead!
Fixate on her as she walks towards the door.
Forgive me, I didn't say "now".
You have to look at her as well, and maybe reach out like this?
Like he wanted to touch her, but couldn't.
She's mad at him.
He has allowed himself to be a total failure.
Begin!
Now!
Stop!
Bengan!
The sliding door doesn't work.
When Dr. Fürstenberg comes out you turn towards him.
Like that.
Yes.
That's better.
Is that okay for you?
Come out of the room and walk towards them.
Just like that.
And she...
Like so...
That's correct, Yes.
And then Alma leaves.
Alma comes out this way when the kettle is empty.
Around here, and exit over there.
And...
Please begin, Petra!
-Lydia
-Lydia!
Here she comes.
Lydia is running.
She pays no attention to the children.
And then Petra..
Like that, and put it down.
-That works doesn't it?
-Yes, excellent.
This is what the scene looked like.
It took 3 hours to finish.
-What's the verdict?
-It's a matter of hours.
-Is he in pain?
-No, he sleeps a lot.
You two!
Go to the kitchen.
There's bread and cocoa for you.
A camera movement should never be noticeable.
Sven and I disagree on how to acheive this.
You can stand up now.
And walk away.
-It's of course...
-That small camera movement...
-The tilt.
-You have to live with it.
It's not my problem.
It's easily done.
But if she appears in almost the same place where Ewa exits...
That's not very good.
This was very good.
-I don't understand what you mean.
-Listen up.
Ewa is over here.
The camera is straight, like this.
Then she comes here.
Then you have to tilt it.
She can't be placed behind her.
That would look weird.
-In line for something.
-I thought "at the same time".
Yes, but not from behind her.
You will have to tilt it.
I don't understand your point.
I would like to...
Ewa, come here!
Gunn, please stand over there.
Now she's standing.
That's the cue for Gunn to start.
And you leave.
Like that.
That's good.
It's important that you won't catch the top of her head.
-Thanks!
-Please hold your positions?
Gunn, a tad earlier please.
Just a second or so.
You can begin a tad earlier.
-When she's sitting already?
-No, by the time she's standing.
-Oh, I was scared to death!
-Don't forget this now.
I won't.
-How does it look?
-Great.
Lasse, you were on the spot, but maybe the transition...
Let's try it one more time.
Fanny.
One more take.
When you're sitting over here, and you come to get them...
Take them in your arms.
Thanks!
Excellent.
Without it being too weird.
-And you got a clean shot of Gunn?
-Yes.
You were a bit late.
Just a tad earlier.
I'll show you.
When she's getting the kids, Gunn is in frame already?
Let's do this!
Thanks!
The Bishop sympathizes
The wall over there...
And that chandelier...
And the black too.
Down to here.
And remove that.
This as well.
Ok, That's good.
Leave some headroom.
It's that chandelier...
Really?
Let's do this as we planned.
Stop here.
I'm nearsighted.
I can't even see the mark.
Excuse me.
That's incorrect.
Like that, Yes!
That's right.
And take a bow.
And take Ewa with you.
Enter where she is now.
Now, where is Gunn?
Gunn!
Stand over there please.
-What was the framing like?
-About here.
I just made it wider.
Where are we?
25,30?
Make it a bit wider here.
That's better.
And you go...
Schh!
Shut up kids!
Fanny!
Walk towards Alexander.
Like that, Yes.
Whisper something in his ear.
And grab his arm.
And then pull him towards you and whisper something awful.
..Around the bishop's wooden leg.
Like that, Yes.
That's good.
And you say...
Dear Emelie Ekdahl!
Words can be so unsufficient.
Like this.
And we'll do a tilt here.
-You said to stop here.
-No.
Let's do a cross cut.
That's fine.
Too bad she walks out of frame.
What's your position, dearest?
Let's see how it looks if we focus on him!
Once again.
Dear Emelie!
Words can be so unsufficient.
I think that works.
Just another thing...
A small adjustment on Ewa.
Let's all sit down!
Not too deep!
Dear Emilie Ekdahl...
Words are unsufficient.
The Baptism.
Hi, Monica.
Hi!
On your old turf?
Since Ekdahls are keen on celebrating, there will be a hell of a party.
The party has lasted several hours and it's time for the cake.
You have all been eating and drinking and the mood is very joyful.
Everybody is blabbing, nobody hears anything.
Everybody is excited.
Where is Jalle by the way?
Maybe he left?
He has three pages to read through.
Ok.
Let's start the festivities.
Yes!
On my mark!
We'll take the chatter bit first.
-Can we eat now?
-One moment, Yes!
One, two, three
- Action!
Thanks!
Very good.
Now, let's have the playback and the music.
Can we have playback, please?
On my mark!
Action!
That was great.
Shall we try a take?
Quiet!
Please begin!
We, the Ekdahl family haven't been put on this earth to try to see it through.
Never believe we are just that.
We are not equipped with any instruments of exclusiveness.
It's better to avoid the big wholeness.
We should concentrate on the simple things in the small world.
We'll worship this small world.
And make it grow.
And make the best out of it.
Suddenly, death approaches.
And an abyss cracks open.
Suddenly a storm breaks out, and disaster strikes.
We know all that already, But we don't want to think about it.
We enjoy all the excuses we make up.
Without excuses you will go mad.
You have to understand people.
Otherwise you can neither love or hate them.
The Puppet Show
This is all great magic.
It makes you shiver.
You are thinking:
Better go talk with mother.
Then sit up and observe the door.
No, now he disappeared.
Where do you want me to be?
-Over there.
-Here?
No, first over there and then...
No, lie down again.
And then raise your head.
That's fine, isn't it?
Do a close-up shot, and then he walks towards the door.
Cough!
Yes, that's good.
You got me now, right?
I Reconstruct Memories From My Own Childhood.
It's A Peculiar Experience.
Put the doll inside.
Before that, sit like this.
With a sort of nauseous look.
Like that.
Yes.
And now you're tired.
Lie down.
And close your eyes.
You're thinking: "I have to go to my mother.
My throat hurts"
Ok, you have to move there.
Pick up the doll.
And a sigh....
And back to the floor.
Close your eyes.
Then look straight up..
..look up thinking:
"I have to see my mother"
I Always Wanted To Become A Director.
Except For A Short Moment, When I Wanted To Be An Engineer.
Come here.
You'll lie here.
Rest your head on your right arm.
Yes, that works.
-That's right.
I forgot.
-Sven, could you check this, please?
Do this instead of shutting the eyes.
My mistake.
Sorry!
And then you let go, and go to find your mother.
Don't do like this.
But rather like this.
Do you understand, Sven?
Try this one more time.
With the figurine in your hand, observing it.
And then let go of it.
Rise up.
Christmas Dinner.
Put this aside.
Like this, Sven.
This is an annual happening.
Everybody is excited.
Like before a Bayreuth passion play.
It's a part of it.
The expectations.
And everything erupts into a lavastream of consent.
Let's do it once more!
-You can give them the cue.
-I did that, but nobody saw me.
You'll have to wait.
Spit out the almond.
And shout: "I got the almond"
Stand up.
Then show it to everybody.
Let's go through this once more.
Stand up.
Like this.
He holds it like that, Yes.
And he says: "A porridge rhyme" (Traditional Swedish rhyming verse)
-A porridge rhyme.
-No, I think sitting down is better.
Everybody is talking, when you announce: "one moment"
One moment!
A porridge rhyme!
-The porridge is like a stronghold.
-It's our food and joy.
-Misery and sorrow will be exchanged for gold.
-At last our hope will deploy!
Like that, Yes.
And you keep talking.
Käbi is drunk as you all know.
And then, Fanny shouts.
I got the almond.
-I got the almond!
Long live the bride of the year!
Hooray, Hooray, Hooray, Hooray!
-Hooray!
Like that!
Do it five times.
I once had haemorrhoids, and my behind was bleeding.
It dripped down the toilet.
And I remember thinking...
I've had something like it.
Begin!
A porridge rhyme!
-The porridge is like a stronghold.
-It's our food and joy.
-Misery and sorrow will be exchanged for gold.
-At last our hope will deploy!
-Well!
-Look, I got the almond!
Long live the bride of the year
Hooray, Hooray, Hooray, Hooray!
No!
When they cheer for you, just stand there observing, right?
Look, I got the almond!
Hooray, Hooray, Hooray, Hooray!
We can't spray that one.
What kind of lamp is it?
Over there.
Dancing in a ring!
How fun!
-And Putte.
-Shall I be here?
And Lydia Carl.
Oscar after Carl, and then Vega.
Then Esther Alma.
Then Emilie after Alva.
And Alida.
Then Siri, Lisen and Jacobi.
Everybody in their places?
Come here.
-A lot of twists and turns at the end.
-It's the hardest position.
Here's the hard part.
You go over here.
Suddenly you take her here.
The others move on.
Push her against the wall, and say...
Would Maj like to visit me later in my room?
Continue here.
She will free herself this way.
That's correct.
And then in here again.
And you force your way in here.
Yes, that's good!
Camera Crew Is Supposed To Follow The Colonel Through A Door.
It Looks Less Hazardous Than It Actually Is.
Left!
My Condolenses.
Left!
Left!
With the deepest upmost respect allow me to kiss your hand.
I offer my complete support.
-Thank you.
That's good.
-Shall I remain here?
He kisses her hand like this.
Then he puts the hand back like so, and then stands like this.
Looking at her.
Like this.
All stiff and serious.
..while gazing compassionately at the widow.
You understand?
-It's not that hard.
-No it isn't.
The Dolls
-Where did you get all the dolls?
-There was a Puppet Theater once.
In the beginning of the 18:th century.
We found them packed in boxes.
It was packed in boxes for the Stockholm World Expo in 1907.
-This?
-Nobody owns them?
There were more than 300 exhibitions.
And the director kept on going.
He rented a place on Biblioteksgatan (Library Street).
Most likely the old RODA KVARN.
Back then it was "OLYMPIABIOGRAFEN"
He worked two more years, and had 18 premieres.
Then he couldn't afford it.
You can have some milk too.
-Who owns them then?
-They belong to the government.
Drottningholm's Theater Museum.
Let's move the bench 8 inches more towards the wall.
And Mattsson will follow.
8 inches I told you!
I had just quit, but then I did a film in which I was smoking, and that made me start again.
But I've been off it now for five years.
Hopefully for good.
-Mom and Dad smoke a lot.
-And you don't like it?
Therefore it's better to blame the mirrors, because people are laughing.
And it's more economical.
Like this, and you go...
-Yes, above all economical.
-Right.
And then: "Look closely"
And go over like this.
Hold the hand down, and then..
You see?
And follow the hand like that.
And then turn it.
Sven Nykvist Uses Minimal Lighting With High Precision.
This is darker.
Light will be here.
And it's not too much.
It's a bit too dark.
Light that now.
-Cover it completely?
-Yes.
-Do you want that half as well?
-Yes, you're right.
Now it's wrong.
Use it to shield off a bit here.
We Think He's Unique.
The Rest Of The World Think So Too.
If you talk too much, the mystique might disappear.
Put a light up here and direct it towards the mummy and the boy.
But now it hits here as well?
That's fine.
We Rehearse The Discreet Camera Movements-
-That Follow Alexander Ismael.
Like that, Yes.
That's good, Jenny.
-It's not me that...
-It's not me talking.
-It's you.
-And then put...
Correct.
-Cover his face.
-Now don't hesitate.
-He sleeps heavily.
-One moment.
Cover his face.
-Like that.
-Now don't hesitate.
-He sleeps heavily.
-And we'll follow the hands.
-Plagued by nightmares.
-Wait, Let's see.
Like that.
Yes.
Stand still!
The hands near the lower edge, and the eyebrows near the upper edge.
And then the mouth.
-And then you say...
-He sleeps heavily, has a nightmare.
Maybe that's good.
Like that.
The doors shall be opened.
Give me your hands, Alexander.
Like that, Yes.
Hands up, please.
It's the safest...
The doors shall be opened.
Hands higher, please!
When the hands are up, do a tilt like this.
One moment!
Keep the hands near the lower edge.
Wait a moment.
I know what you're thinking of.
A big grey-haired man.
He is blue-eyed.
One more time.
It's this camera movement...
Now I had my toes in the way.
We have to time it better.
Ready, Sven?
Just the last bit once more.
Stand up.
-And...
-You're carrying thoughts of a dead man.
Just look into one of his eyes.
His left.
The camera eye so to speak.
Look into that one.
Quiet!
-You're carrying thoughts of a dead man.
Wait!
I know whom.
A big grey-haired man.
He is blue-eyed.
Clear, blue eyes and a friendly face.
Now he's dreaming; he kneels in front of an altar...
By the altar hangs the crucified prophet.
In his dream he stands up and shouts:
"My god, my god - Why have you abandoned me?"
Nobody answers him.
Not as much as a laughter.
-Don't talk like that.
-It's not me talking.
It's you.
-Now don't hesitate.
-Look scared, alexander!
Like that, Yes.
And let her close your eyes.
You don't shut them.
Yes, That's it.
Now don't hesitate.
He sleeps heavily, plagued by nightmares.
With your hands, Alexander.
It's not really necessary.
But it's safer.
The doors shall be opened, a shout will be heard from the house.
-I don't want to.
-It's too late.
I know what you wish for.
A boy like you with a hate that never ends!
Your skinny torso could explode.
Don't be afraid, alexander.
Just don't hesitate.
Therefor I hold you in my arms.
There's only one way to go.
And I'll follow you.
My life expires and I enter your body...
Don't be afraid.
I'm the angel that protects you.
It's five in the morning.
The sun has just risen.
The doors open...
No, Wait.
First there's a scream.
A horrendeous scream that cut through the room.
An unrecognizable, fire-ridden silhouette runs through the house.
I don't want to.
Let me go!
Thank you!
Now you feared the camera.
I could see it in your acting.
Apart from that it was very nice.
Take a brake.
Go drink some, and do a touch up on the make-up.
The Concentration Is Total And We Don't Let Anything Disturb Us.
I know of whom you're thinking.
A big grey-haired man.
He is blue-eyed.
He's increasingly scared.
Right now he is dreaming.
He kneels in front of an altar.
By the altar hangs the crucified prophet.
In his dream he stands up and shouts:
"My god, my god - Why have you abandoned me?"
Nobody answers him.
Not as much as a laughter.
-Don't talk like that.
-It's not me talking.
It's you.
Allan Edwall Practises The Role Of The Ghost In Hamlet.
It's Hard To Portray A "Bad Actor"
Listen up, if you love your precious father.
-Oh my god!
-His bestial deed.
Murder!
-You avenge!
-Mord?
Yes, Murder!
And murder is gruesome by itself, but this is worse!
-Worst..!
-And the most cruel!
-And the most gruesome!
-Speak up!
-A natural slip-up.
-Wonderful, very good!
Now...
A tad more theatrical.
And more energetic.
More hysterical.
Like this.
You understand?
Give it all you got.
Murder!
Everything you've got, Mattson.
It happened, in an instant the leprosy struck!
Like Lazarus, with wounds and boils, 'round my smooth body!
That's how I became at once crowned queen and then dethroned...
And cast away in the midst of my blossoming sins.
With communion, confessional, and salvation then sent to my destiny!
With my guilty conscience and all my sins on my mind.
Awful, Extremely awful!
If you have a heart, It would never cope.
Good!
-A couple of small things.
-Let's do it once more.
When you do this movement..
Sit here.
In an instant.
Almost a second after.
Not like that, but like this!
Do you understand?
Letting the blood of sins just like pouring vinegar in milk.
And then you do like this.
-This button will kill me.
-You can remove it.
Gunnar Bjornstrand Sings:
"The Jester's Song"
Arne Carlsson's Camera Followed Him All Day.
You'll See A Great Actor, And His Battle Against His Own Fear,-
-His Failing Instrument, And His Disease.
Gunnar Bjornstrand Has Approved Of These Takes To Be Shown.
-We must do like this.
-Climb the ladder.
I'll do it like this.
That's a hugh pillow.
Do we need one?
No, the other way.
-Facing the audience?
-Yes.
-You're and old actor, you see.
-That's fine.
Don't let this one scare you.
Can you make it on top of it?
Is that alright?
You don't need a pillow, do you?
Maybe a thin one.
It's pretty rough.
Begin like this.
-Shall we try to do a take?
-Is the candle lit?
No, will be soon.
Can someone please light it?
-The rain maker?
-He's in place.
Thank you!
-A strong scene.
-Once more!
Music!
Thank you!
Music!
-Thank you!
-That was good.
-Did that work?
-Yes.
Maybe one small detail...
When you raise the umbrella, you tremble.
-Yes, it's hard.
-Please try holding it with both hands.
-I can do that.
-Let's see it!
Wait!
That's good!
Maybe more to the side?
So that you don't cover the face.
That works excellent.
That looks even funnier too.
Camera!
Music!
Thank you!
Please move a little to the right!
Left, I mean.
Once more!
That's good!
Please light the candle again.
Camera!
Music!
You held it...
You couldn't see the candle.
It's difficult with a candle glued to your head.
-I need more practise.
-Never mind.
Let's try one more take.
Camera!
Music!
Thank you!
I think that was good.
Phenomenal!
-That's it then.
-They aren't there anymore.
No more.
Went away many years ago.
-I sat like this.
-I'll remove this.
The scarf is visible.
-Is this in frame, Sven?
-No, It's not.
-Can we practise first?
-What?
-Can we try once first?
-Do you want that?
Or with film?
-No, we do it your way.
-If you want to we'll do it.
-I don't think we need to.
-No.
Ok.
Let's try it.
-You want to rehearse the verse?
-No.
Oh, well, maybe the first line.
That's right, Yes.
Like that, and then you take the umbrella over the candle.
One moment!
Quiet!
Camera!
Music!
Thank you!
Perfect!
Masterful!
-You can come out here.
-Yes, Thanks.
-Turn off the rain!
-Too much clatter.
Wait a moment.
-Do you want to sit here?
-Doesn't matter.
Do you think the ramp will show?
Then we have to raise them.
Light the candle.
Hold the umbrella just like on the previous verse.
Like that, Yes.
-And then down?
-Yes.
Like that.
Raise it!
Camera!
Music!
Stop, Gunnar!
Umbrella has to come down.
Once more!
Quiet!
When you begin to sing, place the umbrella on your shoulder.
Camera!
Music!
Thank you!
-How was that?
-Fine!
We can do it once more.
Raise the umbrella.
Music!
Very good, Gunnar!
Once more.
Begin.
-Thanks!
Very nice.
-Thank you.
-Have you practised?
-No.
Remove the candle.
And put it out.
Now I'm in the way again.
So, attach it to my head again?
It was perfect.
It's stuck, right?
It won't fall off while he sings?
Perhaps a little bit more to the side.
The microphone is visible.
Camera!
Music!
Stop!
Don't sing until he finishes the last note.
Once again then!
And the microphone is very close so you can do it low-key.
Never mind the candle on your head.
Quiet!
Camera!
-Do you see the microphone, Sven?
-No.
Music!
You forgot the candle!
Continue.
More rain please.
More intense!
-Imagine there's an audience.
-Yes, I do.
Music!
Thank you.
Stop!
Remove the candle at once.
Otherwise it was good.
Let's try it.
A little more rain.
That's good.
Camera!
Very nice, Gunnar.
Please begin!
Thank you!
Very nice.
Oscar's Funeral Was Filmed On A Very Cold Day.
There were 500 Extras And An Unpresidented Number Of Actors.
-Britt Inger NiIsson?
-Bus no. 6.
Stand still!
The Director Had The Flu And Was Having A Severe Fever.
But With Careful Planning Some Co-Workers Took Over.
Stop!
Let's do this.
And a closer shot.
-Perfect.
How about you, Sven?
-It was perfect.
-It's 11.
-I know.
Explain to the actors that we'll do safety copies and new versions.
We go up close on a few shots.
That's why we do more takes.
-I will.
-Thank you.
Friday 12/2 1982 The 100th Day
We begin with a flash!
-Did you see that?
-And then you run!
-A Thunderstorm.
-It is close by.
-What if it strikes the church?
-God will punish you for such thoughts.
If god punishes Alexander for such minor things, he's a jerk.
Turn around this way!
No, that's too much.
-No, that was the intention.
-I like the flute.
Keep that up!
And then you go. "Schh"
He plays the flute.
And then you turn towards her, and then sit down, both of you.
If we really concentrate hard enough, and wish him dead, he will die.
But we have to start at the same time.
One, two, three
- Die you pig!
When they say that, the second flash has to come.
You say: "one, two, three" Then he'll go first with: "Die you pig"
-Yeah, like we did earlier.
-Correct, Yes.
The second take was good.
-You see him praying.
Then you do it too.
-Yeah, I was about to.
And sit straight.
Both of you.
One, two, three
-Die you pig
-He's still playing.
-We have to try it again.
Look at her when you say that.
One, two, three
-Die you pig
And look up.
And you go...
Is it my turn?
Now it disappeared.
-Maybe he's dead.
-Maybe he died?
Maybe he died?
Me and my sister did just like that.
-I recognize this.
-Did you laugh as well?
No, we were serious.
Once more!
Fanny!
"Do you hear that?
He's playing flute"
-Yes, but you can say whatever you want.
-Yes, but maybe: "Did you hear that?"
-And: "Maybe he died"
-In the end, yes.
Quiet!
Once more!
A giant flash!
Begin!
Did you see that?
-What if...
-Wait!
And listen !
-He's still playing.
-Correct.
There will be sound of thunder, but we'll put that in later.
"If we concentrate really hard.." Sit straight!
If we concentrate really hard and wish him dead, he will die.
-One, two, three:
Die, you..
-And you, close your eyes!
That's right!
Shut them with a grin.
Like you sat on the toilet taking a dump.
But don't do it here!
"If we concentrate really hard"
If we concentrate really hard and wish him dead, he will die.
And then the grin!
One, two, three:
Die, you pig
He still plays.
Let's try one more time.
One, two, three...
-Die, you pig!
-Thank you!
I know you'll concentate later.
Let's do a take!
Did you see that?
-A thunderstorm!
-And just close by.
-Hope it hits the damned church.
-What if god'll punish you?
If god'll punish me for such a small thing like that, he is nothing more than a jerk.
Schh!
Do you hear that?
-If we concentrate...
-A bit quicker, please!
Begin!
Did you see that?
-A thunderstorm!
-And just close by.
-Hope it hits the damned church.
-What if god'll punish you?
If god'll punish me for such a small thing like that, he is nothing more than a jerk.
Schh!
Do you hear that?
If we concentrate really hard and wish him dead, he will die.
But we have to do it together.
One, two, three:
Die, you pig
-He's still playing the flute!
-We'll try one more time.
One, two, three:
Die, you pig
-Now it stopped.
-Perhaps he died?
Thank you!
I Sensed Something Was Bound To Go Wrong.
The Stuntman That Doubled For-
-The Burning Woman Had Prepared Carefully.
Good.
Like that.
Perfect!
Thanks!
-13 seconds, right?
-Yes.
-Is 13 seconds alright?
-Yes, it is.
Who'll wait for who?
We can start this scene now.
We can do the fire-proof treatment.
Is the lighting ok?
Sven isn't completely ready yet.
Even though There Was Careful Planning, He Received Severe Napalm Burns
When Reality Shatters My Work I Feel A Strong Urge To Quit For Good,-
After Seven Months Of Hard Work We Finally Reached The Last Day.
We Were Both Surprised And Sentimental.
Quiet!
Camera!
Action!
Look down the bottom when you're drinking.
Then give her the bowl back.
Thank you!
-Was that alright?
-Yes.
It Was Almost A Sad Feeling.
Everybody has to smoke!
Dear friends!
We don't say "Good Bye"
-It's too depressing.
See you all at the party, we'll all have fun!
Cheers!

THE MAKING OF FANNYAND ALEXANDER
Pictures from a film production can never be more than just that:
pictures from a film production.
The arcane processes, the magic, the violent spiritual and physical exertion - these are glimpsed only occasionally.
What we see, in fact, is an album of memories, images arbitrarily recorded by the mind's eye.
This can be interesting.
It may even be entertaining.
The day before shooting started, we met to say hello, to show ourselves at our friendliest, and perhaps even to conjure up a certain excitement.
Here's our Fanny.
Hi.
I play the role of Ester.
This is Fanny, and this is - What's your name?
Eva, right?
- Fanny, Jenny and Putte.
- That's right.
This sounds strange, and I wonder if it's what I intended.
You see, I've completely forgotten what I wrote.
It no longer exists.
Now I'm just the director who has a piece of material to work with.
This material is now in your hands.
It's fantastic.
It's an incredible relief to see the actors take over.
But be careful with it, understand?
- I'd better read it.
The first day of shooting is always dreadful, so we decided to begin with something easy and pleasant.
One, two, three.
- What do you say?
Will that do?
- It was deafening.
I've been thinking about it.
You've all got slippers on.
- Should we take them off?
- I'm worried you might slip.
What do you think?
It's a bit risky.
- I'll take them off.
- Isn't it better without them?
But make sure you know where they are when you're not on camera.
Actually, it's better if you're not wearing slippers.
Before we begin, let's make sure there are no nails sticking up.
And then - Listen!
Wait a minute.
Stop.
You'll have your torn pillow lying here.
Pick it up and whack Alexander over the head with it.
But not until we start shooting.
So I don't have a pillow in the beginning?
Yes, but you drop it here.
You won't hurt yourselves, will you?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Let's try it once, calmly.
Can I sit here so I don't have to run in and out?
I'm aiming from that teddy bear, so it will be a wide shot.
It's supposed to be.
If the girls can enter a bit later, I'll have time to pan across and back.
Here's what I'll do.
Let's see.
Right.
I'll yell -
No, wait.
- Should we use the cue light?
- No.
We could push a button.
I'll yell "now," Anna and Maj, when it's time for you to rush in.
There'll be a slight delay.
- So we forget about "one, two, three"?
- No, when they've already run in.
As soon as you see them disappear there, swing back over.
Let's try it.
Don't rush in after they've disappeared, until I yell "now."
All right, silence!
Silence!
Action!
Now!
Out!
Cut!
Thanks, that was very good.
The war cry from the girls should come simultaneously.
But I'm sure it will.
How does it look?
- I'm coming over a little too fast.
It took too long.
The camera was there before they came.
Really?
I'd better stand next to you and look at it from your point of view.
Shall we give it a try now?
I'm afraid I'll knock off her wig.
Don't be.
That's makeup's headache.
It won't come off.
Shooting the autumn exteriors in Uppsala was quite stimulating, since the city fathers had received us with unusual generosity.
We were allowed to redecorate the streets and plazas as we pleased.
You'll start there.
Maybe not on "action," but a little later.
We'll see.
This'll be your starting point.
- Will I be selling fish?
- You certainly will.
As for you, you're out buying fish for your cook who's ill.
Let's not make him a hunchback.
- But you're not made up.
- No.
Eva told me to...
Should he have makeup?
You're never made up.
- Well, they usually brush my hair.
- Then go get it done, quickly.
- You've got to have a customer.
- I don't have one.
You don't have one.
I'll get you one.
Just a moment.
You know how to do this, right?
- Sure.
If I ask you to behead one, you'll do it?
You're here everyday without noticing what happens around you, even though there are thousands of people about.
- Quiet!
- Quiet on the set!
Camera ready!
Action!
- Cut!
- Cut!
Back to your places, everybody!
Just a second.
- It's the woman in brown over there.
- Right.
Bertil!
Nice, boys.
Nice.
That was nice.
On the last take, you looked so damn happy walking around looking at everything.
But the dean of Uppsala Cathedral was annoyed when we wanted to pull down his TV antenna.
Maybe he uses it to communicate with Higher Powers.
- Now, damn it!
Let's go!
- Let's get ready to shoot!
Quiet on the set!
Camera ready?
- Yes.
- Camera.
- Hold it.
Just a second.
We're waiting for the sun.
- There's a hair trigger on this one.
Now!
- Camera!
Action!
- Cut!
- Cut!
Everybody, back to your places!
Another take, please!
Let's put a shawl on this pretty girl.
- Wardrobe!
- A dark shawl!
Ingmar's not in this film.
He ended up on the cutting room floor.
You can go sit down on your throne.
Be prepared in case the sun comes out.
We have a lot of things to discuss.
Let's have lunch in peace and quiet, and then we'll meet -
Hell, we're not through yet.
- No, but we can eat later.
That's right.
We have one more setup, don't we?
This one...
- It's the same camera position.
- No.
Sven wants a different one.
- Same set, in any case.
- Yeah, but he's grumpy.
- He's irritable?
- Yeah.
He's grumpy.
He wants to stand up there.
He claims we discussed it.
But I can't remember it.
- On the contrary.
We had decided - We talked about it.
- Mr. Nykvist.
- Sven and I agreed on it.
What did we agree on?
We agreed to shoot the theater from somewhere around here.
Here, right here.
Not from out in the street.
Really?
I say we shoot it from here.
The director got it into his head that a cat, two horses, a huge wagon, and an actor could all work in collaboration.
Goddamned cat!
There was no collaboration.
How was that sequence?
The sun's moved.
We got sunlight on the horse.
That's all for today, thanks.
In film, "blocking" is the relation of the actors' movements to the motion of the camera.
Lydia, Fürstenberg and Emilie are in here.
We'll get to you in a moment.
- Do I sit here?
- Yes.
You'll walk - Alma doesn't have a shawl.
Sussi, Alma needs a pitcher.
- Coffee.
- A coffeepot.
He needs a book to read while he sits there.
You don't need the cane.
You've set it aside.
I'll take it.
Alma's supposed to have a pitcher - I mean a coffeepot.
No tray, nothing.
Yes, that's right.
She should have a coffee cup too.
- Should it have coffee in it?
- No.
We'll do that later.
You can put it in your sleeve.
That's excellent.
I'll fix that later.
This is a complicated scene.
It demands some thought.
We'll start with you over here.
He should have a book to read.
Can we get a small book?
Here we see 12 actors involved in their separate and highly detailed activities.
When she gets here... you open the door, like so, and let Dr. Fürstenberg out.
Lydia is still inside.
Dr. Fürstenberg comes out.
You've greeted each other earlier, so you only nod faintly to each other, as if to say that it's only a matter of hours.
Then you step over here.
You might take her hand in yours.
Right.
Then you go over to the others.
Like so.
Right?
Then you come out.
Come out for a moment - Then you step inside.
You wander out for a moment in confusion.
You stand here looking around, and then you go back in again.
And then you close the door.
And then you stand up... to hear what's happened.
Then you go over and offer him some coffee.
You pour a cup for him.
Then you stand here listening.
We'll give them a sign in here.
They'll open the door, and Lydia rushes out, crying.
Weeping profusely, and running.
You run past the group here.
Oh, excuse me, dear.
One more time, Gunn dear.
We'll fix that later.
Let's begin, please.
Look at Grandmother when she enters, both of you.
Sorry.
I forgot to say "now."
You should look at her too.
He can reach out his hand, as if he wanted to touch her, but she doesn't let him.
She's furious with him.
He has allowed himself the luxury of failure.
Action.
Now.
Stop.
Bengan.
Bengan, your sliding door here isn't working.
When Fürstenberg comes out... turn around and face him the moment he enters.
Like that.
I think that's better.
Is that difficult for you?
- Not at all.
Okay, you make your entrance and then go over to them... and she comes out.
That's right.
And then Alma leaves.
Back over there.
Alma can leave this way.
Maybe the coffeepot's empty, so go this way, around them, then out that way.
Good.
And then... go ahead, Petra.
- Wait.
No, it's Lydia.
- Now Lydia enters!
Lydia's running.
She ignores the children.
Then Petra enters.
She puts it down and arranges the cups.
You can put it there for now.
That's it.
Does it work?
- Excellent.
What follows now is the scene in its complete state.
It took us three hours to arrange it, light it and film it.
- How is he?
- It's a matter of hours.
- Is he in pain?
- He sleeps most of the time.
Go see Ester and Vega for hot chocolate and sandwiches.
Cut!
The movement of the camera should be imperceptible.
Sven and I are somewhat at odds over how this imperceptible movement can best be achieved.
Now you can rise.
You stand there, and as Gunn comes forward, you leave.
- It's that dipping of the camera.
- Huh?
- It's that little dip of the camera -
- You simply have to do it.
I'm not complaining.
It's a fairly easy move to make.
I just feel that if Gunn comes in about the same place... where Eva goes out -
That seems a bit contrived.
I thought it was quite good.
I'm not sure I know what you mean.
It's like this:
Gunn is - Eva's up here.
We've got the camera straight up.
And then here comes Gunn, and the camera has to tilt down.
If she was here instead, the camera -
- She can't stand behind her.
That'll look pretty damned peculiar.
Like they're waiting in line.
- I thought she entered simultaneously.
She does, but she can't come from behind Eva.
No, it doesn't work.
You'll just have to make that little dip.
I can't see why it's -
I'd even like to -
Come over here again, Eva.
Gunn, would you stand over there.
All right, now she's stood up.
Gunn starts moving forward, and you walk away.
There.
It's good like that.
You know what's important?
That we don't see a tuft of hair gliding into the bottom of the frame.
- Cut!
- Please stay where you are.
One more thing:
Can't Gunn enter earlier?
- Earlier?
- Right.
The frame is empty for just a second.
You can begin walking - Try moving forward earlier.
While she's sitting?
No, but as soon as she stands up.
Then you can begin to move forward.
You scared me.
- Otherwise?
- Looks great.
Lasse, you did well too.
It was only that transition -
Shall we try it one more time?
What do you say, Fanny?
Want to try it again?
Yes.
They're sitting over here.
When you walk over to get them...
I think you should bring them over like this.
Cut.
Did it flow well?
- Excellent.
- Didn't look strange?
- No.
- And you could find Gunn.
- Yes.
You were a bit late.
I'll give you a clearer sign next time.
Bringing the kids over, I mean.
While she's getting the kids, you're watching Gunn, right?
Is that right?
Okay, get ready for a take.
Cut.
Perfect.
The bishop extends his condolences.
...that wall over there.
Let's follow along.
- That chandelier should be lowered.
- Is this one okay?
Lower it.
And get rid of that black thing.
Take a look over here.
This chandelier must be lowered too.
And that's got to go.
We're also going to remove - Look here, this has to be removed too.
You've already started over there?
Good.
Lower it enough for you to walk under it, Bengan.
Just enough for you to walk under it.
It's that chandelier.
Let's run through this step by step first.
Like this.
Stop here.
What?
All right.
Do you want the spot marked?
No, that won't be necessary.
- You don't need it?
- No.
I'll be damned.
I'm so damn nearsighted, I couldn't see the mark anyhow.
I'll play it by ear.
He enters.
- Left, Jan.
- I'm sorry.
You're standing in front of her.
Can you -
- Like this?
- Like that.
Does it feel strange?
No.
That's about right.
Then you curtsy.
Take the widow with you.
Now you zoom in.
Let's see.
Where's Gunn?
Gunn!
Come here.
You should stand there.
Right there.
How far did you zoom in?
- Like this.
There.
I don't believe so.
I widened a bit here.
- Yes, a bit.
What are we on?
Twenty-five?
I think we can widen imperceptibly there.
Like that.
That looks a lot better to me.
Then you say -
Shut up, kids!
Fanny, go over and stand beside...
Alexander.
You can whisper something in his ear.
Take him by the arm.
Pull him down to you, and whisper something naughty about the bishop's wooden leg.
Just like that.
That's great.
Then you... you say...
Dear Emilie Ekdahl... words are so inadequate.
And here we zoom in, like so.
You said you would stay there.
No.
We'll alternate back and forth on him, then combine the settings.
I don't like her walking out of frame.
How will you be sitting, sweetheart?
Let's see how it looks if we stay on him.
Go back once more so we can see.
Dear Emilie Ekdahl, words are so inadequate.
Maybe that's good.
It's beautiful.
Come, let's go sit down.
Dear Emilie Ekdahl, words are so inadequate.
Cut!
The Christening
- So, here we are again.
- Exactly.
Since the Ekdahls love to celebrate, they've decided to have a spectacular party.
One hell of a bash.
You've been at it for a few hours now.
It's time for dessert, which you do your best to stuff down.
Everyone's full of food and drink and is having a damn good time.
Everybody's talking at once.
No one hears a word the other is saying,
The excitement is tremendous.
Where's Jalle?
Maybe he's flown the coop.
He's got three pages of lines.
All right, everybody.
Shall we get these festivities in gear?
Lets do it!
Okay, then, get ready.
No music yet.
We'll take the conversation first.
- May we eat?
- Of course.
One, two, three.
Begin.
Thank you, that was good!
That was very good.
Now let's have the playback and the music.
I mean, the playback and the conversation.
May we have the playback?
Get ready!
Action!
Cut!
That was fantastic!
Let's try it now.
Quiet, please!
Action!
Therefore... and consequently... we Ekdahls have not come into the world to see through it.
Never think that.
We are not equipped for such excursions.
We might just as well ignore the big things.
We must live in the little world.
We will be content with that and cultivate it and make the best of it.
Suddenly death strikes.
Suddenly the abyss opens.
Suddenly the storm howls and disaster is upon us.
All that we know.
But let us not think of all that unpleasantness.
We Ekdahls love our subterfuges.
Rob a man of his subterfuges and he goes mad and begins lashing out.
Damn it all, people must be intelligible!
Otherwise we don't dare to love them or speak ill of them.
The Puppet Theater
That, you see, is the greatest magic.
It'll make your flesh crawl.
Okay.
Let's close it now.
You're thinking, "I'll go and speak to Mama."
Then you look up, no.
You sit up and gaze at the door there.
No, he disappeared.
- Do you want me to be there or here?
- You should be visible here.
In here?
First here, then there.
No, wait a moment.
Lie down like that.
Like that, and then look at that.
And then you get up.
Get up.
Go.
That's right.
Does that work?
- Yes.
Stay tight on him as he goes to the door.
Cough.
And keep me out of the shot.
Good.
I reconstruct, in detail, a few moments from my childhood 60 years ago.
It's a strange feeling.
Put in the puppet.
Before you put the puppet in, sit like this... and stare, as if you didn't feel well.
That's right.
And now you're tired, so you lie down.
Close your eyes.
Then you think, "I'll go to Mama.
My throat hurts."
You've got to move out of the way, or else he'll see both of us.
Pick up the puppet.
Give a little sigh.
Now lie down.
Close your eyes.
Look up.
Then look up.
Look up and think, "I'll go to Mama."
I always wanted to be a film director, except for a short period when I wanted to drive a locomotive.
Here, I'll show you.
You're lying like this, right?
You're lying on this arm, aren't you?
Yes, that seems to work.
- I forgot it again.
- You certainly did.
Take a look here, Sven.
- Sure.
I got it.
Play with this a little instead of closing your eyes.
Instead of closing your eyes.
I said it wrong before.
Then put it down and think, "I'll go to Mama."
When you get up - Look here.
Don't do it this way, but get up like this.
You understand, Sven?
- Yes.
Try it one more time.
Okay.
You're lying there, playing with it.
Look at it.
Then put it down.
And then you get up.
How's that?
- Much better.
Christmas Dinner
Move the candelabra over to the side a bit.
Sven, can you see it?
- Yes, I can.
Now his bitterness is complete.
- This is the disgusting part.
- Yes, it's extraordinary.
- I'm not having very much.
- No.
This is a yearly performance, and everyone's waiting for it, like the Passion Play at Bayreuth.
They're all anxious with anticipation, and they burst into a storm of applause when it's all over.
Right?
I think it's time to turn on the lights.
Hey, Christmas gnomes Let's raise our glasses and be merry
Our time on earth is brief Full of toil and grief
Hey, Christmas gnomes Let's raise our glasses and be merry
Let's take that again.
Let's pour them some schnapps.
If it's difficult to begin, give them a downbeat.
I did, but nobody was watching.
Okay, but just count.
After "our time on earth," on the return, you should wait.
You didn't the last time.
Spit out the almond.
Then you shout, "I've got the almond!"
Then you get up and show the almond like this, on the spoon.
Let's go through it step by step, now.
Now you stand up.
- Is this the rice?
Let's see.
He holds it like that.
Then he says, "A rhyme for the porridge!"
- A rhyme for the porridge.
- At first, everyone is talking.
And then you stand, and you ask for silence.
You say, "Just a moment!"
Just a moment!
A rhyme for the porridge!
"Our porridge is our strength and stay
It is our staple food
In joy, in grief, both night and day
It always does us good"
Okay, keep on talking.
As for you, you're rather drunk, just as she said.
Now you say, "I found the almond!"
- I found the almond!
Four cheers for the coming year's little bride-to-be!
That's right.
Good.
Say it five times.
A while back I had this bleeding hemorrhoid, and I was sweating as I looked down into the toilet to see if any blood was dripping, and I thought to myself...
I must tell you I once had a...
Much worse.
Action!
A rhyme for the porridge!
"Our porridge is our strength and stay
It is our staple food
In joy, in grief, both night and day
It always does us good"
- Now!
- Look!
I found the almond!
Four cheers for the coming year's little bride-to-be!
Cut!
You stand up, and when they cheer you, look at each of them.
Hey, we mustn't spray that one.
Whose harsh lamp is that?
- Yours.
- No.
- Yeah, yours.
- Just look over there.
- A line dance.
What fun.
- You bet.
It'll go that way.
Wait a minute.
Gustav Adolf.
After him Putte, then Petra.
- Putte.
- Am I here?
Then Lydia and Carl.
Carl's behind Lydia.
Oscar behind Carl.
Then we have Vega, Ester and Alma.
Alma's behind Ester.
Then Emilie after Alma.
Alida, Siri, Lisen, and finally Jacobi.
Is everybody with me?
Come on, now.
Are you with us, Sven?
Be careful, everybody.
There's a threshold here.
- The whiplash is worst at the end.
- It sure is.
I've got the toughest job.
Now this is the funny part.
You enter like this.
And suddenly you steer her over here.
You join their hands.
They keep on going.
Continue.
You push her in there, and you say,
Shall I visit you tonight?
Yes, yes, and you continue on.
She gets free and escapes.
Then she rescues herself by joining the group here.
Unfortunately, you end up here next to your wife.
That's good.
Thank you.
Now it's Yule again, now it's Yule again and Yule will last until it's Easter
That's not true of course No, that's not true of course
The camera and its crew must plunge headlong through a doorway after the colonel.
This is more dangerous than it looks.
Left!
My condolences.
Left.
Left.
Left.
Allow me to kiss your hand in veneration and affection... and venture so boldly as to offer every support an imperfect mortal -
- Can.
- Can.
- Cut!
- Shall I stay here?
He kisses her hand, thus.
Then he puts her hand down again.
Then he stands at attention, as if at a graveside.
He stands there in dumb reverence, staring at the widow passionately.
Yes, with desire.
- That's not difficult.
- Not difficult at all.
The Dolls
Where did you find all the dolls?
They come from an old doll theater from the early 1900s that was stored at Drottningholm Castle.
It was built for the Stockholm Exhibition in 1907.
Doesn't anyone own them?
Over 300 performances were given at the Exhibition.
Then the director, the man who owned the theater, rented a place on Biblioteksgatan, presumably the old Red Mill Theater.
It was called something else before.
There he continued for the next two years and had no fewer than 18 premieres.
But he couldn't keep it up.
It was too expensive.
Who do all the dolls belong to now?
They belong to the Swedish state, specifically to the Theater Museum at Drottningholm Castle.
Can we move that sink over there a little bit, about eight inches towards the wall?
- This one?
- Yes, that one.
And then move the - I said eight inches.
I quit for a year and a half.
Then I acted in a film where I had to smoke, so I started again.
I kept it up for several years, but five years ago I quit.
- My parents smoke a lot.
- Do they?
Does it bother you?
- Yes.
The Mummy
It's better to blame it on mirrors, machines and projections.
Then people laugh, and that's healthier from all viewpoints, especially financially.
That's right.
Like that.
And then you say...
Especially financially.
- And then you say, "Watch carefully."
- Watch carefully now.
Then you go over here.
Now if you hold your hand down here -
Look carefully now.
Can you see the hand there?
Now follow the hand.
Like so.
And then twist it - Like that, right?
How creepy!
Sven Nykvist uses the fewest possible sources of light with the greatest possible precision.
It's darker now.
This is where it comes from.
If we had that light, there wouldn't be any problem.
We've got that one there.
Yes, and it's just a bit too much.
Turn that light on.
How can you mask it?
That's what I was thinking.
Completely?
- Yes.
But it's a little skimpy.
I suggest the half light.
Use the half light.
It's a little stronger.
You're right.
What?
Let me see.
Now that one's not angled right.
It could cover a lot more.
- What?
- We were talking about the light.
Here in Sweden, we consider him unique.
The rest of the world agrees with us.
This light goes up so it hits both the mummy and him.
If you want to, we can switch it for a smaller one.
Now this one's on target, right?
Good, good.
That'll be wonderful.
We'll take it like that.
Now we rehearse the almost imperceptible movement of the camera as it follows Alexander and Ismael.
Is everything okay?
"It is not I..."
It is not I talking.
It is yourself.
Then put your hand in front of his face.
Like that.
You are not to hesitate.
He's sound asleep.
Just a moment.
Hold your hand in front of his eyes.
You are not to hesitate.
He's sound asleep.
Then we follow the hand down.
Wait, let's see... that's right.
Stand still.
The hands are at the bottom of the frame, the eyebrows at the top.
Look here.
Look at the mouth.
Then you say...
You can open it.
It might not look bad if you have to use a bit of force.
Like that.
That's good.
That's enough.
The doors will be thrown open.
Give me your hands.
Then the hands come up.
Lift your hands.
Good.
Hold your hands even higher.
When their hands go up, you go up like this.
Just a second.
Tilt upwards, keeping the hands at the bottom of the frame.
Wait a moment.
I know who you're thinking of:
a tall man with fair, graying hair.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
He has clear blue eyes -
- Can we take that movement again?
My feet were in the way.
You must sense exactly when the movement begins, operator.
That's where you start.
Understand?
Right, Sven?
Take that last bit again.
That's right.
You're already standing.
And then you say...
- You're thinking of -
Look into only one of his eyes.
The left eye, from your point of view.
The eye towards the camera side.
That's the eye you should look at.
So your eyes don't wander.
Quiet.
You're thinking of a man's death.
Wait a moment.
I know who you're thinking of:
a tall man with fair, graying hair.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
He has clear blue eyes and a boyish face.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
He's asleep and dreams he's kneeling at the altar.
Above the altar hangs the crucified prophet.
In his dream he gets up and cries out,
"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
There is no answer, not even a laugh.
Don't talk like that.
It is not I talking.
It is yourself.
You are not to hesitate.
Look frightened, Alexander, before she turns you around.
That's right.
Then let her press your eyelids shut so that you don't close your eyes yourself.
Right.
You are not to hesitate.
He's sound asleep, plagued by nightmares.
Give me your hands.
It isn't really necessary, but it's safer.
The doors will be thrown open.
A scream will echo through the house.
- I don't want to.
- It's too late.
I know your wish.
A little boy like you nursing such hatred.
Your thin little chest could burst.
Don't be afraid, Alexander.
All you have to do is not to hesitate.
I'll hold you in my arms.
You have only one way to go, and I am with you.
I obliterate myself.
I merge into you, my child.
Don't be afraid.
I am with you.
I'm your guardian angel.
It is 5:00 in the morning, and the sun has just risen.
The doors are thrown open.
No, wait.
First a horrible scream echoes through the house.
A shapeless burning figure moves across the floor, screaming.
I don't want to.
Let me go!
Let me go!
Cut!
This time you were a bit too frightened.
Remember that you're playing toward the camera.
In itself, it looked quite good.
Is it working well?
- Yes.
Get out from under those lights, now.
Get something to drink and freshen your makeup, or what have you.
Our concentration is total.
We can't be distracted by the noise in the studio.
I know who you're thinking of:
a tall man with fair, graying hair.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
He has clear blue eyes -
- He becomes more and more scared.
He becomes terrified.
He's asleep and dreams he's kneeling at the altar.
Above the altar hangs the crucified prophet.
In his dream he gets up and cries out,
"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
There is no answer, not even a laugh.
Don't talk like that.
It is not I talking.
It is yourself.
Cut!
Allan Edvall rehearses the role of the Ghost in Hamlet.
It's as difficult for a good actor to convincingly portray a bad actor as it is for a musical person to sing off-key.
List, O list!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love...
O God!
revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
Murder?
Yes, murder.
Murder most foul, as in the best it is.
But this most foul... strange -
- And unnatural.
- Huh?
And unnatural.
Haste me to know't -
A perfectly natural slip of the lip.
It was splendid, splendid.
Damned good.
Now for you.
Overact a bit more.
Work yourself up more.
Get a bit hysterical, okay?
All right.
Give it everything you've got.
Murder!
Everything you've got.
Give it all you've got, young Mattsson.
So did it mine and a most instant tetter bark'd about most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand... of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatched.
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, unhousel'd, disappointed, unannel'd, no reckoning made but sent to my account with all my imperfections on my head.
O horrible, most horrible!
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
Cut!
Good.
We'll just take it one more time.
Sit right there.
Not all at once, but a second later.
Understand?
And with a sudden vigor it doth possess and curd, like eager droppings into milk -
- This collar button is killing me!
- Why not take it off?
Gunnar Björnstrand sings "The Fool's Song" from Twelfth Night.
Arne Carlsson's camera has been observing him throughout this long and arduous day.
What we are witnessing is a great actor's heroic struggle with his own fear, his failing instrument, and his illness.
It should be added that Gunnar Björnstrand saw these takes and gave them his approval.
Climb up on this ladder.
You can sit astride it.
We can try and stick the pillow in like this.
It's awfully big and clumsy.
You might not need one.
No, this way.
- Towards the audience?
- Yes, preferably.
- Odd, having to face them.
Why, an old trouper like you...
You needn't be worried.
Can you sit on this now?
Are you sitting comfortably?
You don't really need a pillow.
- No, but something thinner.
- All right.
Just a little rag or something.
This perch is hard on the rump.
When it starts, you begin like this.
I begin like this, and then raise it up.
That side's lit up very bright.
Shall we try it now?
- Is the candle lit?
- No, but it will be.
Can somebody be the candle lighter?
- Who's the rainmaker?
- He's in position upstairs, I think.
- Is Danne there?
- Yeah.
When that I was a little tiny boy
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain
A foolish thing was but a toy
For the rain it raineth every day
Cut!
We didn't see the candle.
You didn't lift the umbrella enough.
Once more, please.
Music!
When that I was a little tiny boy
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain
A foolish thing was but a toy
For the rain it raineth every day
Cut!
Music!
Cut!
That went well.
- Did it work?
- Yes.
I've been thinking about one thing.
When you lift the umbrella, when you hold it, your hand shakes a bit.
My hand gets so tense.
Yes, but why don't you try holding it with both hands?
- All right.
- Let's see.
Hold it up so I can see.
Hold it.
Let's see here.
That works just fine.
- Of course.
Can you hold it more to the side?
So it's not in front of your face.
- Now it's good.
- It's good right there?
That'll do just fine.
It looks even more comical.
Camera!
Music!
Cut!
- You didn't see me, did you?
- No, but I saw a bit of him over there.
Really?
Move to the right.
No, pardon me.
Left.
He shouldn't be in the frame.
Once more, please.
It's looking great like that.
Let's light up Gunnar again.
Quiet!
Camera!
Music!
The way you're holding it, we can't see the candle.
It's difficult when you have a candle on your head.
I've got so many things -
I should have rehearsed this.
- Don't worry about it.
All right, try it again.
Quiet!
Camera!
Music!
Cut!
The umbrella?
- It touched the candle once.
But that was all.
It was fine.
Phenomenal!
- They're no longer here.
- No.
- Nittel's gone, too.
- But, my dear...
- Decades ago.
- To be sure.
I sat like this, right?
You can tuck this in.
The shawl slid forward.
- It has?
- Can you see this, Sven?
It doesn't show, okay.
Can't we rehearse a little before we start?
Can't we run through it?
Do you want to?
Otherwise we can rehearse it on film.
We'll do as you see fit.
Would you feel better if we rehearsed?
I don't think it's necessary.
Maybe not.
Maybe a certain freshness would be lost.
We'll try it.
- Shall I go over the verse with you?
- No.
Yes.
Read the first line.
"But when I came to man's estate."
That's right.
But when I came to man's estate
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain
'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate
For the rain it raineth every day
Then you lift up the piano -
What am I saying?
Lift up the umbrella.
Begin!
Just a moment.
Quiet.
Camera!
Music!
But when I came to man's estate
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain
'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate
For the rain it raineth every day
Cut!
Excellent!
That was wonderful.
- Come here now.
- Good.
- Turn off the rain.
- What a lot of climbing.
Wait, you have the umbrella.
See that he doesn't slip there.
Can we get that ramp in?
What about the prompter's box?
What?
Then we'll have to set them up.
Quiet!
Light the candle!
Quiet.
Hold the umbrella just as you did in the verse before.
That's right.
- Then he brings it down.
- Then you rest it on your shoulder.
There.
Now hold it up.
Camera!
Music!
But when I came, alas, to wive
With hey, ho, the wind -
Stop.
Gunnar.
The umbrella goes on the shoulder.
- Damn it, that's right.
- One more time.
Raise it a little bit.
Quiet!
When you start to sing, lay the umbrella across your shoulder.
Camera!
Music!
But when I came, alas, to wive
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain
By swaggering could I never thrive
For the rain it raineth every day
Cut!
That was good.
How was the shot?
- Good, fine.
We can take it once more.
Music!
But when I came unto my beds
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain
With tosspots still had drunken heads
For the rain it raineth every day
That was very nice, Gunnar.
We'll take that again.
- With a little less "tossing" now.
- Okay.
From the top, Gunnar.
But when I came unto my beds
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain
With tosspots still had drunken heads
For the rain it raineth every day
Cut!
Very good, Gunnar!
- Thank you.
Can you take that off.
Have you rehearsed?
- No.
- Take it off your head.
- Who do I give it to?
- Then you blow it out.
Then we can put it back on again, right?
It sticks on easily, and it's not difficult to take off.
Is it secure now?
It won't fall off when you're singing?
You're sure it won't?
Guarantee it.
A great while ago the world begun
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain
But that's all one, our play is done
And we'll strive to please you every day
You guys can stand more to the side, here.
The mike's in the picture.
Quiet, please!
Camera!
Music!
A great while ago the world begun
With hey-
Stop!
You don't begin to sing before he's finished the note.
Okay.
I see.
Once again, then.
And take it gently.
You can take it very softly.
- Right.
Just as softly as you did before.
Don't worry about the candle.
Quiet!
Camera.
Do you see the mike, Sven?
Can you see the mike?
No.
Music!
A great while ago the world begun
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain
But that's all one, our play is done
And we'll strive to please you every day
You forgot the candle.
One more time.
We'll proceed at once.
More rain!
It'll get the air out of the pipes!
Turn on more rain!
That's good.
Quiet, please!
Camera.
Music!
Stop, stop, stop.
You should remove the candle at once.
All right, then.
Once more.
It was awfully good.
Let's proceed now.
Give us more rain!
That's good.
Camera.
That was awfully good, Gunnar.
Awfully good.
Nice and soft.
Action!
Cut!
Very good.
Oscar's funeral was filmed on a cold, windy day, with 500 extras, horses, wagons, a brass band, and innumerable actors.
Bus number six.
Stand still.
Smile for the cameraman.
The director had come down with influenza and a fever of 103°.
But thanks to meticulous planning, his responsibilities could be shouldered by his capable coworkers.
Back to your places!
We'll take it again!
Faster, this time!
Get a safety shot.
And then close up.
- It was perfect for us.
For you, Sven?
It was perfect.
Allow me to inform you, gentlemen, that it's 11:00.
I know.
Benita?
Explain to the actors that we need to get a safety take, and that we're filming different variations.
Tell them we're shooting closer this time.
So bear with us.
- Will do.
- Thanks.
FEBRUARY 12, 1982 100TH DAY OF SHOOTING, SHOT 771
We start with a flash of lightning.
- Did you see that?
- Then run.
- The lightning struck.
- It was nearby.
I hope the damn cathedral went to hell.
What if God punishes you for saying that?
If a big know-it-all like him punishes a runt like me for so little, then he's just the dirty bastard I suspect he is.
- Listen, he's playing the flute.
- Turn this way as you speak.
Not with that expression.
That's too much.
- I didn't mean it.
It's good if you play the flute.
Now turn outward.
Like that.
That much.
"Shh!" you say.
He's playing the flute.
If we concentrate -
Then you turn toward her, and you both sit down.
If we concentrate on him dying, then he will.
But we have to start together.
One, two, three:
Die, you devil!
"Die, you devil." Then there's another flash of lightning.
You say, "One, two, three."
Then he says, "Die, you devil," by himself.
Right.
We did it that way before.
It was good the second time, too.
You fold your hands -
- Yes, and I do, too.
- Good.
And sit up straight, like this.
Don't slouch.
Then you look at him and copy his posture.
Okay?
One, two, three.
Die, you devil!
- He's still playing.
- Let's try again.
Look at her, then say "Let's try."
One, two, three:
Die, you devil!
Then you look up.
And you say...
- "You can't..."
- Is it my turn?
You can't hear it anymore.
Maybe he's dead.
- Maybe he died!
- Yes, right.
Maybe he died.
My sister and I used to carry on like that.
I recognize it well.
- Did you laugh about it?
- No.
We were damn serious.
Once more.
By the way, Fanny.
"Listen, he's playing the flute."
But she's to say "shh!" Then "Listen."
- Yes.
And then "Maybe he died."
- No.
At the end, right.
Quiet.
Once more.
There's a gigantic bolt of lightning.
And action!
Did you see that?
Lightning.
- Let's try again.
- Wait.
You must listen!
- "He's still playing."
- That's right.
Exactly, and there'll be thunder here, but we don't hear it now.
Now then, "If we concentrate -"
- If we concentrate on -
Sit up straight.
If we concentrate on him dying, then he will.
One, two, three:
Die, you -
Close your eyes there.
That's right.
Tightly, as if you were on the toilet, pressing as hard as you could.
But don't do it.
Okay, "If we concentrate."
If we concentrate on him dying, then he will.
Right.
Now, squeeze.
One, two, three.
One, two, three:
Die, you devil!
He's still playing.
Let's try again.
One, two, three:
Die, you devil!
Cut.
You'll calm down a bit.
Let's take it once more.
Did you see that?
The lightning struck.
- It was nearby.
I hope the damn cathedral went to hell.
What if God punishes you for saying that?
If a big know-it-all like him punishes a runt like me for so little, then he's just the dirty bastard I suspect he is.
Listen, he's playing the flute.
Just a little faster.
Action!
Did you see that?
The lightning struck.
It was nearby.
I hope the damn cathedral went to hell.
What if God punishes you for saying that?
If a big know-it-all like him punishes a runt like me for so little, then he's just the dirty bastard I suspect he is.
Listen, he's playing the flute.
If we concentrate on him dying, then he will.
But we have to start together.
One, two, three:
Die, you devil!
He's still playing.
Let's try again.
One, two, three:
Die, you devil!
- I can't hear it anymore.
- Maybe he died.
Cut!
All morning I'd had the feeling that something would go wrong.
The stunt man who was to portray the burning woman had prepared carefully.
Very good, very good!
That's right.
Cut!
Thirteen seconds, was it?
Thirteen seconds.
Is that okay?
Very good.
Who's waiting for whom?
We can start with you now if the lighting's ready.
I'll ask about that.
Sven's not quite ready.
But despite our precautions, he got napalm on his hands and suffered severe burns.
Whenever reality plays havoc with my games,
I have a good mind to walk out of the studio forever.
After seven months of concerted efforts, the last day of shooting suddenly arrived.
All of us felt surprised and a bit sentimental.
Quiet!
Camera!
Action!
Cut.
Was it okay?
- Yes.
Well, that's that.
It felt almost sad.
Even those who don't smoke should smoke now.
Dear friends, let's not say good-bye.
It's awful, so let's not.
Let's have one helluva party instead.
Cheers, everyone.
Comments by Ingmar Bergman
Hello everybody, I am Rick Steinberger.
Today I would like to show you a videofilm.
Recent development of science is marvelous.
However these are many mysterious things which we cannot explicate even by the ultramodern technology.
E. g., why the dinosaurs became extinct?
Why migratory birds travel many thousands of miles?
Why UFOs do not show themselves in their true colors to humans on Earth, although they've been observed many times?
Why there are different human races?
No one can answer these questions.
Of course, not even scientists like us.
Today, I would like to introduce to you a most mysterious matter for which we have no explanation.
It was an unbelievable horrible and cruel incident that happened to one ordinary person who lived in Tokyo.
Well everybody, let's have a look at the film together and experience this dreadful story in all its reality as captured on film.
Remember I repeat again Reality as captured on film.
Oh, it hurts, it hurts, uh.
Excuse me.
What is this?
How many times do I have to tell you?
I am not angry.
You do a lousy job and the complaints of our clients are killing me.
Please leave me alone!
It's too much for me.
You want to kill me?
This is a bad joke.
Do you have anything to say?
Say!
Say something!
A bad joke!
Say!
Say!
Listen, I would like to go to the cinema or for a drive.
Which do you prefer?
Whichever, as you like.
- Shall we go to see "Chorus Line"?
That's a good idea.
- Let's go to Ginza after.
I found a great place.
- Did you?
- Well, please do it then.
Ah, Hideshi!
Please redo all of them.
- All of them?
Yes, as soon as possible.
- Excuse me, all of this, too, thank you.
What are you doing here?
No matter what.
Hello, it's me again.
Even people who are graduate from the same school have different abilities.
Some people can accomplish anything, others can succeed at nothing.
The main character of this story is a cheerful but ordinary student.
He succeeded in passing the tough entrance examination to the computer company he had always dreamed of joining.
But the work was boring and uninspiring.
In addition, his mind was starting to be disturbed by the very old and traditional
Japanese human relationship between employee and the company.
It was now affecting him physically and mentally.
He was absent from the company and locked himself in his room for four days now.
He left his room only once.
What will happen with him?
We shall see in this film.
Now everybody, let's have a look at it together.
What're you doing?
Dance!
Dance!
Dance!
I hold your head!
Ah, how stupid!
Taratta, ratta atta, dance of the rabbit.
Grandpa, Hideshi is absent from the company already for four days.
And absence without notice.
And is he has not been fired?
There is no telephone call from the company.
Did his colleagues already forget him?
Oh, how sad.
Don't say sad!
Why is it sad?
Shall we kiss grandma?
We didn't kiss for such a long time.
Let's go!
B-chu!
B-chu!
B-chu!
B-chu!
Ah, grandpa, its good!
I didn't feel so good in a long time!
Feels good!
I really forgot for such a long time.
It's me, I was forgotten!
I have cut my wrist!
What?
Bleeding has stopped.
I feel no pain!
Strange!
I feel no pain.
Not at all.
But why?
I really have cut my wrist.
No pain at all?
Why?
Look!
Why?
Then I can do it?
Nothing, nothing happens at all!
Why?
My arms are cut like this!
But I feel no pain.
No blood!
I cannot die even if I bleed.
Am I a man who cannot die?
No!
It is not true!
I...
I should die!
I should die!
I should die!
Die!
Shit!
Shit!
Die!
Yell!
Why?
It fell!
What did I do?
Grubby?
No...
I may be a real man who cannot die.
Immortal man?
Strange but interesting.
It's sad.
Can't I die really?
I don't want a body like that!
I don't need such a body.
I!
It's not an joke!
I am no more ordinary member of mankind.
What will my father say?
Ah!
I want to die.
Oh it's tough.
I'm hungry.
Oh no, I am dieing.
But not you?
Fool!
Everybody is tired of it.
You make me tired.
Manager Yamanaka!
What kind of fellow is he?
You see?
What is this?
How many times do I have to tell you?
I am not angry.
You do a lousy job and the complaints of our clients are killing me.
Please leave me alone!
It's to much for me.
You want to kill me?
Go to hell my dear!
You know?
How can I say this, it will not be of interest to a person without talent.
I am, you know, rather, what can I say, a person with great sensibility, no?
There are no attractive men in this company.
No men good for anything.
I'll never marry a man who works for the company!
But I don't feel good in Japan, do you?
It's how should I say, the complicated human relationships?
Fools!
What are you really?
Why don't you die!
Now!
Now!
No!
What am I, a Zombie?
Is it a dream?
I feel no pain!
No pain, is it a dream?
Yes or no?
Not a dream?
What's happened?
1-1-0.
No that's not it.
In this case, it's 1-1-9.
Emergency services.
Fire or ambulance?
- Hello!
I am a man who cannot die.
- Cannot die?
May I have your name?
- My name doesn't matter.
What happened to you?
- I cut my wrist, but the blood... my blood stops.
- Good!
Are you ok?
Just as I was.
Excuse me.
Then, what can I do for you?
- I am sorry.
What shall I do?
What can I do?
Well, I'll call somebody!
I'll call somebody.
Whom shall I call?
Shimomura?
He will be frightened.
Yoshida?
Takiguchi may be good, because he is a timorous man.
Well, Hayashi.
He has a weak back.
His back will get worse.
Well, well, Takashima would be good, too.
Shall I call the Minato Ward office?
The Tax office?
Whom shall I call?
E-T!
You are fairly...
What did you say?
Nothing.
Don't stop in the middle.
That's teasing.
I'm not a tease, you know?
Then don't tease me.
Tell ma all.
I m fairly what?
You are fairly bold.
What does that mean?
- Because you surprise me.
What surprised you?
- Don't pretend not to know.
What?
Tell me.
- No!
You!
Am I so fantastic?
- No!
Stupid!
Not that!
Tell me, tell me.
What's then?
How?
You surprised me, you were shouting "oh, oh, oh" so loudly.
Stupid!
Hallo this is Nakamura speaking.
Who is it?
Hideshi-san?
What's the matter with you?
You've been absent for days.
It's been a lot of trouble.
How are we?
We're dead.
We have had to do all your work.
Yes, it's been tough.
Yes.
Anyway, what have you been doing?
Where are you now?
I was dead in my house.
- It is us who were dead.
Really, you are irresonsible!
Manager Yamanka was really angry.
He said he was going to kill you.
Did he call you?
No one called me at all.
Strange.
Some one had to have called you.
What?
You want me to come to your house now?
No!
Anyway not now!
Please, come.
Ah, you have a girl in your room!
No, nobody in my room.
I am not as popular among the girls as you.
Believe me.
And what?
Yes I have done the gardening.
Yes, I have the gardening scissors.
What are you going to do with them?
Do you want them now?
A hatchet?
Just wait, Hideshi.
What is going on now?
Why should I bring such things to you?
Oh no!
Really no!
I have to get up early tomorrow morning.
Please!
This is the last thing I will ever ask of you.
Please!
Please!
Please!
It's cold, how come it's still snowing this time of year?
Really.
I already put my coat away in my closet.
But you really are a good hearted fellow.
I wouldn't got to him at midnight in such weather.
- But I owe him for the time being.
- You didn't tell me that you were working on the side as his gardener.
- Oh yes.
I am a good gardener.
Hideshi will be surprised when he sees us.
Hideshi!
Good evening!
Strange!
Hideshi!
Hideshi!
Oh my!
What a surprise!
Woa!
Welcome to my cursed house, Mr. Elvis Nakamura!
What happened with you, Hideshi?
Welcome!
Cu-cukk, cu-cukk, cu-cukk my pale face!
I am not the Hideshi of before.
No longer the old Hideshi who is always apologizing...
No, I am sorry.
Not really but...
Meet the new Hideshi who will not die.
I will show you many painful things.
It's not true.
Look!
Look at this horrible thing.
It is the piece of carotid.
No!
Hideshi!
What are you doing?
Please stop now!
Stop now!
Murder!
Murder?
I kill nobody!
Ah!
No!
Don't do it!
Nakamura.
Oh it's painful, Nakamura.
It's painful.
So I have to cut here.
Stop it please!
You do it well, Nakamura.
What's that?
It's a large intestine.
I cut it out.
But I do not die.
Look!
Say don't cry Nakamura.
It feels good to cut out my stomach and inestine.
And next?
It's my bladder.
Dirty man!
Stop it now!
I telll you I am with Kyoko!
Please forgive me.
I m sorry!
Oh, oh!
Prize man Nakamura?
Look, look!
Let's get on with it!
What comes next?
I used company money for my own account.
I am sorry!
It's the first I heard of it.
Please pardon me!
Oh, you apologize?
Hideshi!
Please stop it now!
One more!
Nothing more!
And today's show and entrails are over!
Did you lose consciousness?
It has such a strong impact.
The horror, it petrifies them.
I would be petrefied too, if I had to look at it.
So, well, what shall I do for an encore?
It's late.
What is Nakamura doing?
Hideshi might be sick.
Where is Hideshi?
Maybe something terible has happened.
What happened?
Hey!
I told you hatchet.
But this is an axe.
Elvis is late.
Hideshi?
Was it a family name?
Good evening!
Come in!
I am the man who cannot die.
Dirty!
What did you do?
Wow!
No!
You made such a mess.
I can't help it.
Nakamura!
Get up!
Get up!
What are you doing here?
Oh, I am so sorry.
- I was waiting for you outside.
Oh, horrible.
You made me dirty.
Oh!
Say Hideshi!
What are you doing?
You've made such a mess.
What will the owner of the room say?
- Kyoko.
It's awful, isn't it?
Don't act stupid!
There is nobody who wouldn't feel awful now.
It is... rather dirty.
Really, it's dirty.
Why?
You don't feel awful?
No, no!
It's not awful.
I need a cleaner.
Cleaner!
Clean the room!
- It became awfully usual.
Heavy.
What is it?
What?
What is this?
Kyouko.
No, I have to check by myself.
Aha!
It my hand.
Is that so?
- You cut it off by yourself, didn't you?
Just leave it.
Really you are silly.
A mere neck cannot clean the house, can it?
- Even if only my neck is left,
I'll go to my office.
Yes, I can stand up now!
Something is different!
I feel a different Hideshi from yesterday.
Ok, I feel I am living.
I will go to my company.
- Hideshi, where shall I put this video?
Which video?
- This dirty one.
Hide it.
I don't want Kyoko to see the video.
How did you find this film?
It is an unbelievable story.
It is only a story which happened in Tokyo.
But it is not only a story for some unknown audience, it may be for you, watching this video.
You may be a second or third immortal man.
Or maybe you are already an immortal man.
Let's have a think, what are life and death for mankind.
The secret is found within yourself.
Anyway, please take care.
Hello everybody, I am Rick Steinberger.
Today I would like to show you a videofilm.
Recent development of science is marvelous.
However these are many mysterious things which we cannot explicate even by the ultramodern technology.
E. g., why the dinosaurs became extinct?
Why migratory birds travel many thousands of miles?
Why UFOs do not show themselves in their true colors to humans on Earth, although they've been observed many times?
Why there are different human races?
No one can answer these questions.
Of course, not even scientists like us.
Today, I would like to introduce to you a most mysterious matter for which we have no explanation.
It was an unbelievable horrible and cruel incident that happened to one ordinary person who lived in Tokyo.
Well everybody, let's have a look at the film together and experience this dreadful story in all its reality as captured on film.
Remember I repeat again Reality as captured on film.
Oh, it hurts, it hurts, uh.
Excuse me.
What is this?
How many times do I have to tell you?
I am not angry.
You do a lousy job and the complaints of our clients are killing me.
Please leave me alone!
It's too much for me.
You want to kill me?
This is a bad joke.
Do you have anything to say?
Say!
Say something !
A bad joke!
Say!
Say!
Listen, I would like to go to the cinema or for a drive.
Which do you prefer?
Whichever, as you like.
-Shall we go to see "Chorus Line"?
That's a good idea.
-Let's go to Ginza after.
I found a great place.
-Did you?
-Well, please do it then.
Ah, Hideshi!
Please redo all of them.
-All of them?
Yes, as soon as possible.
-Excuse me, all of this, too, thank you.
What are you doing here?
No matter what.
Hello, it's me again.
Even people who are graduate from the same school have different abilities.
Some people can accomplish anything, others can succeed at nothing.
The main character of this story is a cheerful but ordinary student.
He succeeded in passing the tough entrance examination to the computer company he had always dreamed of joining.
But the work was boring and uninspiring.
In addition, his mind was starting to be disturbed by the very old and traditional
Japanese human relationship between employee and the company.
It was now affecting him physically and mentally.
He was absent from the company and locked himself in his room for four days now.
He left his room only once.
What will happen with him?
We shall see in this film.
Now everybody, let's have a look at it together.
What're you doing?
Dance!
Dance!
Dance!
I hold your head !
Ah, how stupid !
Taratta, ratta atta, dance of the rabbit.
Grandpa, Hideshi is absent from the company already for four days.
And absence without notice.
And is he has not been fired?
There is no telephone call from the company.
Did his colleagues already forget him?
Oh, how sad.
Don't say sad !
Why is it sad?
Shall we kiss grandma?
We didn't kiss for such a long time.
Let's go!
B-chu!
B-chu!
B-chu!
B-chu!
Ah, grandpa, its good !
I didn't feel so good in a long time!
Feels good !
I really forgot for such a long time.
It's me, I was forgotten!
I have cut my wrist!
What?
Bleeding has stopped.
I feel no pain!
Strange!
I feel no pain.
Not at all.
But why?
I really have cut my wrist.
No pain at all?
Why?
Look!
Why?
Then I can do it?
Nothing, nothing happens at all!
Why?
My arms are cut like this!
But I feel no pain.
No blood !
I cannot die even if I bleed.
Am I a man who cannot die?
No!
It is not true!
I...
I should die!
I should die!
I should die!
Die!
Shit!
Shit!
Die!
Yell!
Why?
It fell!
What did I do?
Grubby?
No...
I may be a real man who cannot die.
Immortal man?
Strange but interesting.
It's sad.
Can't I die really?
I don't want a body like that!
I don't need such a body.
I!
It's not an joke!
I am no more ordinary member of mankind.
What will my father say?
Ah!
I want to die.
Oh it's tough.
I'm hungry.
Oh no, I am dieing.
But not you?
Fool!
Everybody is tired of it.
You make me tired.
Manager Yamanaka !
What kind of fellow is he?
You see?
What is this?
How many times do I have to tell you?
I am not angry.
You do a lousy job and the complaints of our clients are killing me.
Please leave me alone!
It's to much for me.
You want to kill me?
Go to hell my dear!
You know?
How can I say this, it will not be of interest to a person without talent.
I am, you know, rather, what can I say, a person with great sensibility, no?
There are no attractive men in this company.
No men good for anything.
I'll never marry a man who works for the company!
But I don't feel good in Japan, do you?
It's how should I say, the complicated human relationships?
Fools!
What are you really?
Why don't you die!
Now!
Now!
No!
What am I, a Zombie?
Is it a dream?
I feel no pain!
No pain, is it a dream?
Yes or no?
Not a dream?
What's happened?
1-1-0.
No that's not it.
In this case, it's 1-1-9.
Emergency services.
Fire or ambulance?
-Hello!
I am a man who cannot die.
-Cannot die?
May I have your name?
-My name doesn't matter.
What happened to you?
-I cut my wrist, but the blood... my blood stops.
-Good !
Are you ok?
Just as I was.
Excuse me.
Then, what can I do for you?
-I am sorry.
What shall I do?
What can I do?
Well, I'll call somebody!
I'll call somebody.
Whom shall I call?
Shimomura?
He will be frightened.
Yoshida?
Takiguchi may be good, because he is a timorous man.
Well, Hayashi.
He has a weak back.
His back will get worse.
Well, well, Takashima would be good, too.
Shall I call the Minato Ward office?
The Tax office?
Whom shall I call?
E-T!
You are fairly...
What did you say?
Nothing.
Don't stop in the middle.
That's teasing.
I'm not a tease, you know?
Then don't tease me.
Tell ma all.
I m fairly what?
You are fairly bold.
What does that mean?
-Because you surprise me.
What surprised you?
-Don't pretend not to know.
What?
Tell me.
-No!
You!
Am I so fantastic?
-No!
Stupid !
Not that!
Tell me, tell me.
What's then?
How?
You surprised me, you were shouting "oh, oh, oh" so loudly.
Stupid !
Hallo this is Nakamura speaking.
Who is it?
Hideshi-san?
What's the matter with you?
You've been absent for days.
It's been a lot of trouble.
How are we?
We're dead.
We have had to do all your work.
Yes, it's been tough.
Yes.
Anyway, what have you been doing?
Where are you now?
I was dead in my house.
-It is us who were dead.
Really, you are irresonsible!
Manager Yamanka was really angry.
He said he was going to kill you.
Did he call you?
No one called me at all.
Strange.
Some one had to have called you.
What?
You want me to come to your house now?
No!
Anyway not now!
Please, come.
Ah, you have a girl in your room !
No, nobody in my room.
I am not as popular among the girls as you.
Believe me.
And what?
Yes I have done the gardening.
Yes, I have the gardening scissors.
What are you going to do with them?
Do you want them now?
A hatchet?
Just wait, Hideshi.
What is going on now?
Why should I bring such things to you?
Oh no!
Really no!
I have to get up early tomorrow morning.
Please!
This is the last thing I will ever ask of you.
Please!
Please!
Please!
It's cold, how come it's still snowing this time of year?
Really.
I already put my coat away in my closet.
But you really are a good hearted fellow.
I wouldn't got to him at midnight in such weather.
-But I owe him for the time being.
-You didn't tell me that you were working on the side as his gardener.
-Oh yes.
I am a good gardener.
Hideshi will be surprised when he sees us.
Hideshi!
Good evening !
Strange!
Hideshi!
Hideshi!
Oh my!
What a surprise!
Woa !
Welcome to my cursed house, Mr. Elvis Nakamura !
What happened with you, Hideshi?
Welcome!
Cu-cukk, cu-cukk, cu-cukk my pale face!

Oh, horrible.
You made me dirty.
Oh!

Anyway, please take care.
Harvey.
Your mother was a wonderful woman, Adam.
You keep her memory proud.
Come on, son.
Well, it's only you and me now, boy.
Mr. Milsap.
I'm Jane Muncie, county social services.
We met in your daughter's hospital room.
- I remember.
- I'll be out to see you very soon, sir.
We have some very difficult decisions to make about Adam.
Oh, but this is hardly the time.
This is Harvey Milsap, Station K219-niner-1, broadcasting in the clear on frequency 558 to outer space.
I say again, this is Harvey Milsap calling outer space.
Is anyone out there?
Over.
Grandpa?
Grandpa?
It's the middle of the night.
What are you doing up?
- Couldn't sleep.
- Me neither.
Why'd she have to die, Grandpa?
I mean, first my dad, then her.
Why'd they have to leave me?
I don't know, son.
You won't leave me, will you, Grandpa?
Never.
- You promise?
- As God is my witness.
Did you have a good sleep?
Who can sleep all scrunched up in a back seat?
- Want me drive for a while?
- Yeah, sure.
What are you doing?
I hate when you do that.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.
You like it.
- Hey, wait a minute.
Stop the car.
- Now, how can I stop the car?
Oh, yeah.
There.
- What is it?
- Listen.
What are you listening for, a sign from heaven?
There.
Look at that.
Will you look at that.
- Let's go.
- Where?
Just follow that star.
Why did I know he was gonna say that?
Grandpa, did you see that?
Could it be, you know, one of them?
Could be, I expect.
Sure landed close.
You know, might even be worth looking for.
Yeah.
Do you think we'll ever see spacemen, like you did, Grandpa?
We sure will, boy.
You sure will.
Driving on the moon with all these potholes.
Where is this falling star of yours, anyway?
Should be getting close.
Better slow down.
We need new shocks anyway.
- Mark, you're driving too fast.
- Hey, you wanna get there, don't you?
Besides, don't worry, the suspension is already shot!
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah, I think so.
I'm not too sure about the car.
Boy, this is the granddaddy of all potholes.
This isn't a pothole.
We're in a crater.
You mean, this is it?
This is where the meteor hit?
- That's right.
- Well, where is it?
Shouldn't there be a big hot rock around here or something?
- That's it.
- That made this hole?
That's what's left of what made this hole.
Come on, let's go.
Hi, there.
That's all right, son.
Don't be afraid.
We're strangers here.
We need some help.
Yeah.
Crashed in the hole there.
Are you from up there?
- Up there?
Does he know you?
- Yeah, I'm from up there.
You can call me Jonathan.
This is Mark.
We mean you no harm.
- What are you doing here?
- We got a message to come.
A message?
Wow, that's from my grandpa.
He's always sending messages into space.
- Into space?
Now, look, all we need--
- Is a room for a couple of days.
Can you help us, Adam?
Wow, you know my name.
Of course you would.
My grandpa talks about me.
Yeah, Mrs. Kelsey has a room for rent.
All right, that'll be fine.
But you got to make us a promise.
You don't tell anyone who we are or where we came from.
No one?
Not even my grandpa?
No one, not even your grandpa.
Agreed?
Agreed.
Can I look in the hole?
Sure, go ahead.
There's nothing here.
Where's your ship?
What the--?
Where's my ship?
It's being repaired.
Don't worry about it.
Come on, Adam, let's see about the room.
It's easy for him to say.
He can fly.
Car only had 180,000 miles on it and it was paid for.
How long do you think you'll be staying?
That's kind of hard to say, Mrs. Kelsey.
- Oh, please, call me Mildred.
- All right, Mildred.
Do you have any other boarders?
Well, actually, you're my very first.
My son had that room until recently.
And then he got a job offer in another state, you see.
And it was for the best.
He's 30 years old.
Time he was on his own.
Land sakes, it's 10:00 already?
I can't miss my soap opera.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Oh, no, not again.
Oh, your TV on the fritz?
It's Harvey Milsap across the street, playing with his radio equipment and antennas and such.
Is that Adam's grandfather?
The neighbourhood had to get a court order to stop him from operating that equipment any time except in the middle of the night.
He just ignores it.
Why don't you just tell him to shut it off?
Oh, I'm afraid of the old coot.
He believes in flying saucers.
Can you imagine?
And he spends all night trying to communicate with spacemen on his radio set.
Now, there's no telling what a person like that might try to do.
Well, I'll talk to him, see what I can do.
Well, I don't know what good it would do.
Don't sell Jonathan short.
He can be mighty persuasive at times.
I'll do my best.
- Was it okay?
- Hey, it was perfect.
- We got a room.
- Great.
Look, Adam, I wanna give you something for helping us find this place and for keeping our secret.
Wow, I've never seen a rock like this before.
Hey, that's no ordinary rock.
It came a long way from here.
It's got powers.
Powers?
What can it do?
Well, it all depends who has it.
It means different things to different people.
But it's got amazing power, as long as you believe.
I believe, all right.
Come on, I want you to meet my grandpa.
Okay, but remember, we got a secret.
Yeah, I know.
It's gonna be hard to keep but I will.
Let's go.
This is very serious, Mr. Milsap.
As a social caseworker, my report will weigh heavily
- in the judge's decision.
- I'm the boy's grandfather.
He's all I got and I'm all he's got.
There's no decision to be made.
Yes, well, it's not that simple, I'm afraid.
You're a widower and you're unemployed.
Well, I can't help being a widower, but I'll get a job.
How's that?
Well, there are other considerations I have to make.
Certain indications show that you are not providing the proper psychological environment for Adam.
Psychological environment?
What the dickens does that mean?
Certain neighbours have informed me that you spend a lot of your time doing some very bizarre things.
Like trying to contact alien beings on your radio.
Oh, that's crazy.
Who'd say a darn thing like that?
Your neighbours.
Mrs. Kelsey, for one.
Mrs. Kelsey?
Well, for your information, that long-nosed, old biddy doesn't even know me well enough to call me by my first name.
But let me tell you-
I say again, this is Harvey Milsap calling outer space.
Is anyone there?
Over.
This is Harvey Milsap, Station K219-niner-1, broadcasting in the clear on frequency 55--
All right, it's true.
Just because I think the good Lord might have put other creatures on other planets, doesn't mean I'm crazy.
It means, I'm curious.
And there's nothing in the whole world that's wrong with that.
All right.
I'll accept that.
But that doesn't alter the other problems.
- I said, I'll get a job.
- At your age?
I'm healthy and I'm not afraid of hard work.
Just give me time to get a job and prove myself.
I'll be back in a week.
Good day, Mr. Milsap.
Grandpa, this is Jonathan and Mark.
They're staying over at Mrs. Kelsey's house.
I'm Harvey Milsap.
Pleased to meet you.
- Pleasure.
- Hi, how are you?
You got quite a place.
What do you generate?
Close to 10 000 watts.
Built it myself from scratch.
Grandpa transmits to outer space.
He sends messages, like I told you.
- He's a ufologist.
- Oh, don't go on now, Adam.
Most folks don't even know what that means.
Oh, sure.
That's an expert on UFOs.
Grandpa saw one once, a flying saucer.
Hush, Adam.
You're running on like a leaky old faucet.
He watched it land and people got out, didn't they, Grandpa?
Well, sounds kind of crazy.
Not at all.
You believe it?
Sure.
Who knows what goes on up there?
You know, I had a friend once that thought he saw an angel.
An angel?
And folks call me crazy.
I don't want to sound like I'm complaining, but Mrs. Kelsey wondered if you could turn off your transmitter.
She's trying to watch her soap operas.
Oh, that nosy, old busybody.
Tell her it's off.
- We'll see you later.
- You bet.
Oh stop by.
I got a bunch of books on UFOs.
I'll do that.
- See you, Adam.
- See you.
Where'd you meet those two?
On the dirt road, while I was looking for the meteor.
You find anything?
No.
No, not a thing.
Come on, you gotta run.
All, right.
Yeah.
- All right.
- Come on.
Come on, let's go.
Hey, wimp.
- Hey, Adam.
How you doing?
- Okay.
- How come you're not playing?
- I didn't get picked.
I never do unless they're one short.
I'm pretty lousy.
Well, you practice a lot?
I've got no one to practice with.
Besides, I'm just no good.
Well, you never will be with that attitude.
I got a glove back at the place.
We'll toss the ball around a little bit.
You play baseball where you come from?
Sure we do.
And we're good, too.
And you know why?
- Why?
- Practice, boy, practice.
Come on, run.
All right, now you're gonna see what practicing can do.
All right, back up to the sidewalk there.
All right, now, get your body into it.
Come on, now, pitch it right in here.
See?
I'm just lousy.
You're not giving yourself a chance, Adam.
Hey, Adam, what happened to the stone?
Nothing.
It's right here in my pocket.
- Then why don't you use it?
- I'm not sure how.
All right.
You got the stone, so all you have to do is believe you can do it.
- Believe in yourself.
- That's it?
That's it.
Go on, why don't you try it again, huh?
And this time, believe.
Come on, Adam, what are you doing?
You giving up?
- No, I'm not quitting.
- All right.
All right, pitcher, let's see your fastball.
Put it right in here.
- It works.
- Well, sure, it works.
I gotta get Grandpa.
I want him to see.
Okay, but remember our secret.
Oh, I know.
I just want him to see me pitch.
- You give him the stuff, huh?
- No, he always had the stuff, he just didn't believe it.
Why didn't you tell him it wasn't the stone?
I will.
When the time comes.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
Wait'll you see.
I can pitch great, really great.
Grandpa?
I know.
I cry sometimes too.
But we're gonna be all right, just you and me.
That's just it, son.
They're trying to stop it from being you and me.
What do you mean?
I mean, that lady that was here the other day?
She's from the county.
They're trying to take you away from me.
What do you mean?
They can't do that.
Oh, yes they can.
They can do anything they darn well please.
They don't care about love or...
They just care about the rules.
I got no wife.
I got no job.
- But you can get one.
- I tried.
It ain't very good.
You know, you reach a certain age and folks won't hire you for nothing.
But they will, they will.
You just wait and see.
Today's just one day.
You'll find something tomorrow.
God, I pray that you're right, son.
I pray you're right.
- Now, who is that one?
- That's Cameron.
He's engaged to Iris.
He used to be married to Phyllis.
Phyllis?
Now, she's the one that Cameron's boss is blackmailing, right?
Very good, Mark.
You learn fast.
Look out Iris, Cameron's gonna open the door.
Oh, no.
It's no use.
When Harvey Milsap turns on his machines over there, it just messes up everything.
Well, I'll just go have a little talk with Mr. Milsap.
Mildred, I think it's about time you took the bull by the horns and went over there and talked to him yourself.
You know, you're right.
Enough is enough.
Mr. Milsap, I'd like a word with you.
Well, I'm busy right now.
You were told not to turn on that contraption of yours while other people are trying to watch television.
I know that.
Well, then, why are you doing it now?
- I'm not.
- You are.
And I'm telling you I ain't.
Hold on a minute.
Are you saying that the transmitter's not on?
No.
I'm just going out to look for work.
Why would I want to have it on now?
Must be your TV set this time.
But I never had any trouble with that set.
Well, you do now.
Mildred, I'm afraid he's right.
Well, then I apologise.
Cranky old biddy.
Oh, come on, Harvey.
She had good reason to think it was you.
- Well, it wasn't.
- Well, she apologised, didn't she?
Why don't you go over there and see if you can't fix her set for her.
Why should I?
She said some bad things about me.
- Then show her she was wrong.
- What for?
I don't like her.
Harvey, you don't even know her.
Come on, what's it gonna hurt to be a good neighbour, huh?
All right, let's go.
There you go.
It's as good as new.
Well, I declare, that is a better picture than I've had in years.
Oh, it just needed a little adjustment, a little tightening here and there.
I don't know how to thank you, Mr. Milsap.
Well, just being a good neighbour, Mrs. Kelsey.
Mildred.
I mean, we are neighbours.
We should be on a first-name basis.
All right, Mildred.
Well, I gotta be going.
Harvey?
I've got a hot apple pie in the kitchen, if you'd like some.
Why, thank you, but I gotta get going into town.
Well, maybe another time.
Yeah.
Yeah, that'll be nice.
- Mind if I ride into town with you?
- Be my guest.
I guess you found out Mildred's not a screeching banshee after all, huh?
She's a nice lady.
What are you gonna do about keeping custody of your grandson?
- How do you know about that?
- He told me.
Well, they said I should get a wife or a job to raise Adam properly.
Jobs ain't easy to get at my age.
- What'd you do before?
- Carpentry.
Too tough at my age.
Many people said I was too old to work, lost my usefulness.
Can't even care for a 9-year-old boy anymore.
- Sounds to me like you're giving up.
- No, I ain't giving up.
Honestly, Jonathan, I don't know what to do.
I'd think a man with your skills would have no trouble finding work.
What skills?
Electronics.
I mean, look at the way you fixed Mildred's TV set back there.
That's just a hobby.
Well, maybe that's what you'd call it, but TV repairmen do darn well.
Yeah?
You know, I never thought about that.
By golly, I think you've got something there.
Hey, I'd like to hire you.
Lord knows I could use the help.
But that sign in my window says,
I only use certified technicians in my place.
If you'll only give me a chance to show you what I can do.
- Sorry.
- Well, how do you get certified?
The state gives a test once a month.
The next one's Saturday morning down at city hall.
I know because my nephew's taking it.
It'll be his fourth time.
He hasn't passed it yet.
This test, it's tough, is it?
It's tough, all right.
Anyone passes it really knows his stuff.
Hey, well, that's Harvey.
Nobody knows more about electronics than he does.
Well, then go on down and sign up for the test.
Cost you 20 bucks.
If you pass, you got a job.
Well, Harvey, it looks like today is your lucky day, huh?
Why is that?
Well, you heard the man.
You take the test and you got a job.
He said, if you pass the test, you get a job.
- No way I can pass that test.
- Come on, how do you know that?
Because I know.
I got no formal education.
- But you've got practical experience.
- Big deal.
These young whippersnappers today, they're all like wizards.
No.
No, I can't pass it.
I hate to see you let the boy down just because you're afraid of failing.
- I don't wanna let the boy down.
- Well, then take the test.
You can't pass it if you don't take it.
Come on, get some guts, Harvey.
Well, let's just say I can't afford the $20 right now.
- Hey.
Hey, look at this.
- Where is that...?
Hey, who cares where?
Are you telling me this isn't a sign?
You need $20 to take a test and, bingo, you got $20.
You got no excuses.
You take this down to city hall and you sign up for that test.
I'll see you later.
All right, I will.
- Do you think--?
- Sir, this is your admission form.
Be sure to bring it with you on Saturday or you won't be allowed to take the test.
Yes, ma'am.
I'll remember.
- And good luck.
- Thank you.
You know, you're gonna need all the luck you can get.
Oh, you think so?
It's that hard, is it?
No, it's a snap, if you're an electrical engineer.
If not, then good luck.
- You've taken the test?
- Twice.
Failed it twice, even though I took every correspondence course I could find.
Do you know what they say?
Third time's the charm.
Yeah.
- Well, good luck.
- Thanks.
Good luck to you too, sir.
Hold that piece of paper, that's gin.
Oh, Jonathan, that's four in a row.
You are lucky at cards.
It can't last.
I'm not a good card player.
- Go on.
- Yeah, go on.
Be right back.
My deal.
Jonathan, it is not much fun when you use the stuff.
I would think you'd let the lady win one.
- I didn't use the stuff.
- You swear?
Is that really necessary?
I'm an angel.
- Look who's here.
- Hey.
Hi, Harvey.
How you doing?
And look at the lovely flowers that he brought me.
Oh, hey, those are really pretty.
We're just playing some cards, Harv.
You want to join in?
Oh, no, thank you.
I just came to ask Mildred if she wanted to walk down and get some ice cream.
Wednesday night they got this crazy Bubble Gum and Cream.
Well, I hate to leave my guests.
Oh, no, go ahead.
I'm really getting tired of watching him win anyway.
Well, all right, if you don't mind.
Let's go.
Hey, Harv, you get signed up for the test all right?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I did.
See you later.
A cute couple.
You know, I think Harvey's sweet on her.
Yeah.
I just hope it's for the right reasons.
Well, I did it again.
Got half the ice cream on my shirt.
Well, that's not your fault.
They put too much in them.
- You can't eat them before they melt.
- I used to when I was a kid.
Oh, well, we used to do a lot of things when we were kids.
Yeah, ain't that the truth.
- We probably still could.
- Could what?
Do a lot of things that we don't do.
We get lazy and we stop trying.
I suppose.
But maybe we're afraid of trying.
Well, here we are.
- Seems like we just went out.
- Yeah.
- Look, do you like the movies?
- You mean, go out to one?
- Yeah.
- Oh, I haven't done that in years.
Seems like in all of them, everybody says "hell,"
and the next thing you know, they're naked.
- We can always cover up our eyes.
- Okay.
- Tomorrow night?
- What?
Go to the movies.
I suppose I could find us a PG.
- I'd like that.
- Tomorrow night then?
Can I play?
No way, wimp.
Get lost.
Yeah?
I bet I could strike you out.
You?
No way.
- Why don't we see?
- Okay, wimp, get on the mound.
Oh, no.
It's in my other pants.
Hey, let's go, wimp.
- Yeah, let's go.
Come on.
- Come on.
- I gotta go home for a minute.
- What for?
I just gotta go.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
It's probably Old Man Milsap's suppertime and Rogers has to go home and spoon-feed the crazy old man his oatmeal.
- My granddad's not crazy.
- Oh, of course not.
Has he seen any flying saucers lately?
My dad says Milsap the Sap is nutty as a fruitcake.
- He ought to be put away.
- Take it back, Jeff.
- Make me.
- I can't today.
Coward.
I'm not a coward.
I just can't today.
Well, how's Saturday, before the game?
Does that suit you better?
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be here.
Milsap's a sap and so is his chicken grandson.
Milsap's a sap and so is his chicken grandson.
Milsap's a sap and so is his chicken grandson.
We got that hedge of yours in the back yard trimmed down to size.
- Oh, you boys didn't have to do that.
- No trouble at all.
Mrs. Kelsey?
I'm Jane Muncie.
We spoke last month concerning Mr. Milsap across the street.
- Yes, of course.
Won't you come in?
- Thank you.
And these are my new boarders.
- Jonathan Smith and Mark Gordon.
- Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Mrs. Kelsey, what I have to discuss with you is of a private nature.
- Private?
- Yes.
It concerns your engagement to Mr. Milsap.
- My engagement?
- Yes.
He told you that we were engaged?
Yes.
He said you were to be married within the month.
Isn't that correct?
No.
Why should he say such a thing?
Well, I'm afraid he was using you.
You see, I told him he needed employment or a wife if he wanted to have custody of his grandson.
I see.
Mr. Milsap, this is Mildred Kelsey.
I'm afraid that I have to decline our date for tonight.
No, not tomorrow, not ever.
I have just spoken with Miss Muncie and I must ask you not to see me again.
Not ever.
Excuse me.
- Hello.
- Hey, Rogers.
Jeff.
Just wanna make sure you didn't forget about our little date tomorrow.
- No, I didn't forget.
- You mean, you're gonna show up?
Of course I'm gonna show up.
Well, I gotta give a few friends a call, make sure they don't miss it.
Like Hollie Sims, the one you're keeping your eye on all the time.
I don't care who you call.
We'll see how big you talk tomorrow.
What are you sitting out here for, Grandpa?
Just thinking.
Aren't the mosquitoes biting you?
No, there's not enough blood left in an old man to make it worth their while.
It's getting late.
What time you gotta take that test tomorrow, Grandpa?
- Grandpa?
- I ain't taking it.
What do you mean?
Oh, because there's no way in heaven that I can pass the test.
Folks go to school and they study books year after year to learn everything they know.
I never had any schooling in electronics.
Everything I learned, I learned by myself.
But you know everything.
Nobody knows everything, son.
Especially an ignorant old man like your grandfather, who quit school in the eighth grade.
But you gotta pass that test, Grandpa.
You know what that lady said:
She'd take me away from you.
I don't wanna leave you, Grandpa.
And I don't want to leave you, son.
But there's nothing I can do.
I wasn't supposed to say nothing about this, but I gotta now.
See this rock?
It's got the power.
- What are you talking about?
- It's true, Grandpa.
I can't tell you anything except I got it from an alien.
Like the ones you seen that time.
They gave it to me.
You can do anything if you got it.
That's nonsense.
That's what the folks said when you told them about the spacemen.
And they were right.
What?
They were right.
I never saw such a thing.
Never.
But why?
Well, because people call me crazy and silly and I wanted my grandson to think I was more than I was.
- But I'm not lying, Grandpa.
- Adam.
On my mother's grave, I'm telling you true.
Do you know what you're saying?
You know I wouldn't say it unless it was so.
Sleep good, Grandpa.
It'll be all right.
Quite a boy.
Where'd you come from?
You gave him this stone.
Where did you come from?
That doesn't matter.
What matters is you take that test tomorrow.
Well, I can't.
I figured I couldn't pass the test, so I I threw the certificate away.
The lady said I couldn't take the test without it.
God, I wish I hadn't thrown it away.
Jonathan, look.
Jonathan, Jonathan.
- Hi, Adam.
How's it going?
- Here.
- What's this?
- A letter to my grandpa.
I wanted to tell him how much I love him.
Why don't you just tell him yourself?
I gotta fight Jeff today.
I might get killed or something.
I wanted him to know.
See, I gave Grandpa the stone so he could pass his test.
Now I gotta fight Jeff without it.
Oh, I see.
I'll tell you, that was a pretty brave thing you did, giving him that stone.
Look, Adam, I have a confession I'm gonna have to make to you.
That stone I gave you, there's nothing magical about it.
It's just a piece of meteor fragment I found.
It doesn't have any powers.
But I pitched perfect strikes.
I threw better than I ever could.
That's right, you did.
But the stone didn't have anything to do with it.
Then, why'd you say it was magical?
Oh, I don't know,
I wanted to give you something to believe in.
I'll tell you something.
The magic's all inside of you, if you believe in yourself.
Then, I don't need the stone?
Never did.
Just in case I don't believe in myself enough, be sure to give the note to Grandpa.
I will, Adam.
Bye.
Come and get it, runt.
- Come on, go get him!
- Come on, get him!
Hit him!
I still say your grandpa's loony.
Milsap the Sap.
You can say whatever you want about me, but don't you ever say anything against my grandfather.
Hey, Adam.
Hey, Adam, come on.
Now look, come on, that's enough.
Adam, that's enough.
Hey, hey.
Hey, that's enough.
I guarantee you, he's not gonna say anything about your grandfather again.
Come on, let's go home.
Where do you think you're going with that boy, miss?
Well, you know good and well where.
And from the looks of Adam, it's none too soon.
Well, what the devil happened to you?
I was in a fight.
But I won.
Well, if you won, I'd sure hate to see the other fella.
Come on, Adam.
Now, hold on, miss.
You and me got a bargain.
You are looking at a genuine, certified, electronics technician.
And I got me a job starting Monday, making more money than I ever made in my life.
I'll have to confirm that, of course.
Oh, you do as you like.
But, until then, you get back in that buggy of yours and scoot.
- You passed the test?
- With flying colours.
But I couldn't have done it without this.
Your magic stone.
I must have lost it in the hole in my pocket.
It doesn't matter, Grandpa.
We don't need the stone.
The magic's inside of us.
Well, Mildred, we're on our way.
We wanna thank you for all of your hospitality.
Yeah.
I can't remember the last time I tasted cooking as good as yours.
You sure you can't stay just a few more days?
I wish we could, but we've got some work we have to do.
Of course.
The house just gets so empty.
Looks like your television set's on the blink again.
That's Harvey Milsap again.
This time I am going over there and put a stop to this nonsense.
Evening, Mildred.
Mr. Milsap, your radio antenna is disrupting my TV programmes.
It hasn't been on.
It hasn't been for two days.
I apologise.
Good night.
Mildred.
I don't blame you for the way you feel about me.
In the beginning, it was a plan.
I was scared of losing my grandson.
But now I want you to know that this crazy old man who lives across the street from where you live,
loves you dearly.
Hi, Mrs. Kelsey.
Are Jonathan and Mark at home?
They're moving out, dear, but maybe if you hurry...
Excuse me.
- He's a nice boy.
- I couldn't lose him, Milly.
That's why I did what I did.
Could you forgive me?
It's something worth talking about.
Jonathan?
Mark?
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.
Hammer!
In my office right now!
Right this minute, Hammer!
Hammer, I got a problem.
Do you know the reporter Phil Gumm from Action News?
I don't watch the news, I make it.
He wants to ride along with one of us for one day.
- So what's the problem?
- He chose you!
- Why me?
- Because, on paper, you have a perfect arrest record.
You have put over a thousand men behind bars.
God knows if any of them are guilty of anything!
- They looked guilty to me.
- You don't understand my dilemma.
I've been fighting with City Hall for over two months.
They're talking about making cutbacks.
The Mayor's threatening this department.
Do you understand what I am saying?
- You want me to kill the Mayor.
- No!
I'm saying this report could either help us or hurt us.
It could be good PR or bad PR.
I'm ordering you to act responsibly.
Don't worry, me and my one-man band will give him some wholesome family entertainment!
Put that gun away.
Now, get the hell outta here!
Over here is where we do our fingerprinting.
That man over there is a fiendish killer.
Tied his dates to a Magic Fingers bed.
- 12 women massaged to death.
- How awful.
Made the Ten Most Wanted list.
Also made Cosmo's Bachelor of the Month.
Hi.
You must be that Mr Gumm I've heard so much about.
Hammer... this is the reporter.
Oh.
Hi.
I'm Inspector Hammer.
How's that story going so far?
All I've seen is a bunch of policemen hanging around and not doing much.
Just wait till you see me in action, paI.
Doreau, can I see you for a second, please?
I want you to do something for me today.
It's very important.
- Sir, I can handle anything.
- Keep Hammer under control.
I'll settle for no gunplay.
Just try for no gunplay on camera, all right?
If you make a good showing today, I can tell City Hall to go stuff it.
Admit it, punk, you were trying to steal a car.
But that cop said he had no handcuffs so he ties me to his fender like a deer.
Then he called me names.
He called me Bambi.
Hey, there he is!
That's him!
- Who's that?
- My favourite hood ornament.
- I didn't have handcuffs...
- Could we drive?
We have business to take care of.
I realise you're driving, but could you look to the camera?
I wanna catch your good side, OK?
Mr Gumm, today you're gonna find out what it's like to be a real cop.
It's not like the guys on TV - JT Hooker shooting moon men.
Ahh!
Hammer!
Being a cop is stench, it's bodies... .. it's floating corpses.
Ever see a body that's been lying in an alley for two weeks?
- No.
- Well, we'll do it after lunch.
- What was that?
- A plate.
It came from over there.
We'll put a stop to this right now, whatever it is.
Aghhh!
I can't stand the smell of lacquer on your breath!
That's liquor, you hag!
- All right, freeze!
Police!
- Phil Gumm, Action News.
- Thank God you're here!
- All right, drop it, fella.
Nice and easy.
Hey, what's with the cameras?
We're not fighting here.
Where did the broken plates come from?
A Greek wedding?
Listen, people, I'm running out of patience real fast.
I wanna hear how this whole thing got started and I wanna hear it right now!
I can't say on TV.
Can't you just give me a hint?
Oh, come on, just a...
Whisper it in my ear.
- Oh, you're a lousy lover.
- Why...!
Listen, paI, why don't you try eating oysters, huh?
- Hammer, please!
- It's a good suggestion!
Let me handle this.
It's not gonna work.
- Sir, you look like a sensitive man...
- Oh, him?
Get serious!
Will you stop?
Please!
Every couple has their ups and downs.
- How long have you been married?
- A week.
OK.
Well, promise me you'll go and have some counselling on this, OK?
Yeah, yeah, sure, baby, I promise.
He's lying!
You're not gonna leave me here with him?
Please!
Listen, ma'am, just between you and me, I'm not a big fan of counselling, OK?
So, if he gives you any more trouble... use this.
Let's go.
You be good.
We're outta here.
- Come on!
- OK, take it easy, take it easy!
Gimme the money in the safe!
Hurry up!
I'll blow your head off!
Take it easy!
Here you go.
You filth!
That's for charity!
- Shut up and give me the money!
- Here!
- Anything else?
- Yeah, gimme two lottery tickets.
Here you go.
Here.
First you play Dr Ruth, then you take a coffee-and-doughnut break.
All you've done is confirm the stereotype of the police.
I am not impressed.
OK, I would like to address that particular stereotype if I may.
Fine.
Your stereotypicaI doughnut is nothing but dough and sugar fried in fat, right?
That fat gums up your arteries and goes to your brain and you turn liberal.
Then Barry Manilow is on the turntable and you're voting for gun control!
See what I'm saying?
See the connection?
- Yes, yes.
- That's why I eat granola.
- I'd like a cup of coffee, please?
- What?
Oh, yeah... sure.
- Get that camera off me!
- What's the matter?
I'm camera-shy.
I was a child actor.
- Hey!
- What?
Better close that safe.
Some braindead rodent's gonna rob you.
- Here.
Goodbye.
- I gotta pay you, don't I?
On the house.
Just get outta here.
I gotta close up shop.
- Wait, this place is open 24 hours...
- Where am I?
Take this, Doreau.
Know what I'll do to you?
Stick your head in that microwave and set it on "sandwich"!
- You can't do that!
- No setting for sandwich?
- This is appalling!
- That's right.
The only reason I steal is cos I ain't got enough to eat.
Oh, are you hungry?
That's it?
Cover him, Doreau.
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna give him a little bit of lunch.
That's expired two weeks ago.
He can't eat that.
Ohh, six weeks old.
That's much better.
This is...
Ooh, expired 1968.
'67, '66.
Look at this.
Good, good, good.
- Eat.
- You can't make him eat that.
Well, he's nothing but scum and bones.
Eat!
1959.
Very good year for horseradish.
Oh, he should've saved room for dessert!
So our police can't solve a crime unless they've the dumb luck to stumble on it.
Well, that's not true, Mr Gumm.
Part of our job is to prevent crime.
- Statistics show a 45%...
- You don't have to feed him that bunk.
We found that crime because there's crime everywhere in this jungle.
A crime happens every 12 seconds...
- Sledge, your car!
- Right on time!
Come back here, you tapeworm!
Get in!
Sorry, police business.
Go, go, go!
- I'm not sure this is a good idea.
- Trust me, I know what I'm doing.
- Come on, come on!
- Hammer!
Come on, come on, after him!
I don't have insurance till next week.
- Always remember to turn into the skid.
- Just don't ask me to parallel park.
Hammer, be careful!
The brakes, hit the brakes!
Hit the brakes!
Everybody, jump!
- You OK?
- Yeah, fine.
So does this mean I won't get my licence?
Hammer, where's Gumm?
- Think he's dead?
- You'd better hope so.
Doreau, I told you how important this was.
You let me down.
You let this precinct down.
I just wanna say, in Hammer's defence...
- Shut up, Doreau.
- Captain, let me just say that I am sorry.
The next time you send a reporter out with me, I'll do a better job.
- Next time, next time?
- Well, if there is a next time.
Think I'll let you drive off a cliff with Dan Rather?
No, no!
I never repeat myself!
Doreau, would you excuse us for a moment, please?
Certainly.
Close the door.
Thank you.
How can you joke after what you did to that poor man?
Poor?
He makes 20 times what I do.
Besides, he wanted to ride with me.
You almost killed him!
Ah, well, the key word here, of course, is "almost".
He's fine.
I heard him screaming my name in the ambulance.
- I cannot believe what happened to him!
- Hey, it was tough on all of us.
The paint job on my car got scratched pretty bad.
You don't see me crying.
Hammer, I called him to apologise.
He would not answer the phone.
Well... he had, you know, two... broken arms and they're bad, I mean, they are busted in half!
They got 'em back.
When this gets over the air, men are going to lose their jobs, Hammer!
Let's just...
Really, now, take it easy.
I'm sorry.
I've been softening him up.
I sent him candy and I sent him flowers and now there's...
Let me show you, I have to show you.
Singing telegram.
See if you like this.
Ahhh!
Just a note from your pal Sle-e-e-e-e-edge
Sorry you fell off the le-e-e-edge
Thank you very much.
Well, I don't know.
That was sorta cute, right?
Little rhyme with the sledge-ledge and the "aa" rhyming scheme.
Hammer... is it your goal to make my life a living hell?
I don't really have any goals, Captain.
I just try to take things day by day.
'Beep!
'
The bird is speeding.
You know, just once I'd like to see the coyote eat that feathered freak!
- Ah, well.
- Well, Hammer, it's time for the report.
- That's right.
Turn on the news, please.
- Certainly.
'Coming up - downtown rocked by another Extortionist bombing.
- 'Now, time for Gumm On The Street. '
- Don't worry, it's not gonna be that bad.
'As you know, our police are facing massive lay-offs 'so I took the opportunity to objectively observe them in action.
- 'I was quite surprised at what I saw. '
- So far. so good.
'Our cops are nothing but a bunch of pistoI-packing, trigger-happy brutes. '
- Sorry he was so hard on you.
- 'We don't have police.
'We have frontier gunslingers.
'You feel they'd like to get up on a roof, start shooting, 'and hope that they hit a criminal!
'
Who needs to go on a roof, huh?
'How dangerous are our police?
'Let's say, I spent one day with them and came away with two broken arms 'and I consider myself very lucky. '
- I don't wanna hear what Trunk will say.
- I'll bet he didn't even see it.
'That concludes our special report.
And now back to Miami Vice. '
Hey, nice work, buddy!
You did it this time.
Don't give me a swelled head, huh?
- Cleaning out your locker?
- I got laid off this morning.
- I'm sorry.
Anything I can do?
- No, you've done enough already.
- Hammer.
- I'd like to register a formal complaint.
- Somebody wrote "fink" on my locker.
- Yes, Hammer, that was me.
- What's going on?
- Ever since your brilliant performance,
City Hall has been up in arms.
The Mayor has ordered me to lay off half my men.
The only consolation I can think of is that I am rid of you.
- I'm suspended again, right?
Pity.
- No, you don't understand.
You are fired, sacked, dumped, banished, terminated!
You're outta here, you're history!
That's a wrap!
What are you getting at?
Hammer, you are no longer a cop.
Sorry, Hammer.
They laid off a lot of good men.
They ought to be adding cops, not getting rid of 'em.
Guess everybody thinks I let 'em down, huh?
- I'm gonna go.
- Thought about a new job?
No, I was born to do this!
When I was a kid, I took a vocational aptitude test.
They said I was best suited to be a cop!
A cop!
A cop or a game show host.
Listen, there's a lot of things you can do.
I mean, I'm sure you can find something that's worthy of your unique capabilities.
All right, you people, move along.
The rest of you people, stay there.
All right, kids, come on along.
Gee, mister, can I see your gun?
Son, this thing is not a toy.
You remember that, all right?
Go ahead.
This city is going wild.
I got snipers and no SWAT team, bombs and no explosives experts and, on top of that, there's an outbreak of crossing guard brutality.
Sir, if things are so bad, perhaps you should consider Hammer.
Hammer?
Hammer?
He single-handedly caused this entire mess.
Do you really think you should let one bad day ruin a man's career?
One bad...
One?
One bad day?
Are we talking about Sledge "I didn't know the thing was loaded" Hammer?
Yes?
Oh, that's all I need.
All right, I'll get on it.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
There's been a bomb planted in the business district.
There are over a thousand people down there.
Report to the scene immediately.
Alone?
What do you expect me to do?
Look good.
Attention, I want the attention...
All right, sorry, kid, you're clean.
Go ahead.
'.. update on the business district bomb scare.
'The Extortionist time bomb could go off any second.
Police have evacuated... '
Sorry, kid, I need this.
official school crossing guard business.
No one has found the bomb and soon a neighbourhood will be laid to waste and no one has the courage to do anything about it, especially...
Look out!
Quit lying down on the job, Gumm.
Keep your dignity.
- My cast!
- I'll have to sign that later.
- I got a bomb to take care of.
- Hammer, what are you doing here?
I won't let some mutant blow up half this city, especially the half I live in.
- The bombers are leftist militants.
- I hate those guys.
They asked for a million dollars, a plane, and an end to Star Wars.
- Yeah, well, three movies were enough.
- They tied sticks of dynamite to a clock.
Dynamite tied to a clock.
Oh, finding that will be child's play.
Turn that off!
I don't wanna make a hero outta that bozo!
More than you're doing, Gumm.
Gimme that.
We'll let the public decide.
Doreau, get out, get out!
Only a fool would come in here!
- What's this?
- These are the clocks I checked.
- I got all these to go yet.
- You'll never make it.
The bomb's gonna go off in a couple of seconds.
I got an idea.
Stand back.
Bingo!
- You know how to disarm a bomb?
- I don't.
I have this.
Bomb Disarming, my Book Of The Month Club selection this month.
Go, Hammer, go!
Go, Hammer, go!
Go, Hammer, go!
Go, Hammer, go!
Go, bomb, go!
Go, bomb, go!
- Go, Hammer, go!
- Go, Hammer, go.
Go, Hammer, go.
All right, here we go. "If remaining wires are orange and brown... "
Orange and brown.
Check.
".. see next volume in the series. " typical!
- What are we gonna do?
- Don't panic.
I've been in pressure packed situations before and there's only one thing to do.
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo.
Whoa!
What...?
Time to get up!
Enough adulation.
Well, I guess even a cretin can look good on TV.
Don't flatter yourself.
Take a second look at this city's cops that took a bum rap on account of me.
By the way, I got something for you.
Officer, would you hold this, please?
Let's go, Doreau.
Hammer, because of your effort, the Mayor has allowed me to rehire my entire force.
And it has also been approved that we all receive a 20% increase in benefits.
Never thought I'd see the day when I'd say this, but, Hammer,
I'm proud to have you on the force.
If there's anything I can do to show my appreciation, just let me know.
Thank you and get out.
Well, actually, there is one thing.
No!
Well, you said anything.
No, you said it.
If you don't...
All right, all right, all right.
What is it?
It's something I've wanted to do for a long time, but it takes two people.
This does not involve a gun, does it?
No, no!
Come on, no, of course not.
- No.
No.
- Try it.
No!
No.
Hammer...
Hammer!
Friends, we are gathered here on this occasion... to join together this young man and woman in the bonds of holy matrimony.
This is both a joyous and serious occasion.
The exchange of rings is symbolic of the bonds of matrimony... one that signifies a transformation of your individual selves... as God's picked representatives of.... ...purified and beloved of God, himself.
As the ring encircles your finger, let love encircle your heart.
...kindness, humble in mind.
If there is anyone present who knows any reason... why this man and this woman should not be joined.... ...and be most patient....
Guide them by your word... to serve you all the days of their lives.
Dear Lord, strengthen Deborah and Michael with the gift of your spirit.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Thank you, it's wonderful to see you.
You look very beautiful.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Mr. Prosecutor.
Larry.
It was a lovely wedding, you should be very proud.
Even got a little choked up there for a minute myself.
You?
There's not a judge in town that will believe that.
Now, don't use it against me in court, huh?
Buy you a drink.
We can't leave without saying good-bye.
Robert, we're on our way.
Just wanted to say congratulations and thanks.
So soon?
Yeah.
Can't have too good a time.
Everybody back at the monastery gets jealous.
Here's the father of the bride.
It's picture time.
How can I refuse?
How are you, Crockett?
Those that have given their statements are free to go.
We ask you not to discuss your statements with anyone else or any other witnesses.
Crockett... if there's anything I can do to help....
Sure.
If we catch the guy, I'll give him your number.
What is your problem?
I don't dig seeing my friends get killed.
Or don't you remember?
Langley and I were very close.
Yeah?
How close were you to Grainy?
I was this close.
What's this got to do with Grainy?
I filed a motion, the judge declared a mistrial.
Take it up with him.
Don't read me the record, pal.
There aren't any technicalities to hide behind on the street.
I had to stand there and watch Grainy bleed to death.
Your partner's got some great timing.
How about we shelve this till after the funeral?
You want to fill me in?
I was showing the ropes to this... this new kid, Grainy, a few years ago.
It was our first week under.
Our first week.
We were working some Rastas.
They tried to pull a rip.
The kid got nervous....
They shot him in the face twice with a .45.
I collared the guy and tuned him up a bit.
Mr. "Hotshot" Thurmond... got him a mistrial on some... shaky, due process rap.
The guy just had a kid.
His wife freaked.
It was a nightmare.
Come on, Sonny, let's get out of here.
Yeah, all right.
Let me give this supplemental to homicide.
The word from the hospital confirms what you've already heard.
Assistant State Attorney Richard Langley is dead.
He was one of us.
He used to open doors for me at the courthouse.
I liked him.
Two other people were killed along with Langley.
Sisters, in their teens.
Bridesmaids in a wedding they were all attending.
Crockett and Tubbs are still on the scene.
Any I.D. on the shooter?
Caucasian male, but no positive I.D.
Who would want to kill Langley?
Was it something personal?
No.
Then what?
Richard Langley, for the past six months, has been guiding the D.E.A. efforts... to bring pressure against Jean Faber's outfit.
French Canadian connection.
Is Faber that crazy he'd put a hit out on a state's attorney?
Le Loup, a nightclub up by Fort Lauderdale.
State's attorney's office says that Faber's people have been spotted there.
I want you to work it, hard.
It was you.
It was you, wasn't it?
Are you crazy, man?
What are you talking about?
If you think Faber is going to approve of this....
That's not your business, is it?
You ever killed a man, Marcel?
No, you don't have the guts.
No guts in there at all.
Hey.
Come on, tough guy, show me.
Not here.
Parlez-vous français?
Polly want a cracker?
You ain't got nothing on me.
Nothing.
Oh, yeah, but you've got something on you.
Qu'est-ce que c'est, buddy?
You're under arrest for the possession of narcotics.
Possession?
You made my night.
Well, you have the right to remain silent.
Hey, come on, one gram.
It's a joke.
You're a lawyer, figure something out.
What about the actual arrest?
Did he fail to read you your rights, or threaten you in anyway?
Nice suit, very nice.
I should be out of here by now.
I don't like to speak no evil of the dead, but you become a crusader like Langley... and things are bound to happen, know what I mean?
You're talking about murder here.
Three people.
Two of them teenagers.
Yeah, well what do you expect?
Twins are bad luck.
Twins?
How do you know they were twins?
I read it in the papers.
The paper only said they were sisters.
Maybe I heard it on the radio.
Where were you last night before Le Loup?
I was having dinner at Duke's.
Hey, where do you get off asking me that?
Just do the job Faber is paying you to do, understand?
Just do your damn job.
Keep the reins tight, Marcie, so he knows where to go.
Won't that hurt his mouth?
No, Popcorn wants you to tell him what to do.
Like all your boyfriends will when you grow up.
Bonjour, Monsieur _hurmon_.
Hi, princess.
Larry.
I know I'm interrupting.
No, I wish you'd come by more often.
Speculating isn't your style.
Even Sagot's alibi about being at Duke's is phony, Jean.
And murdering two children and an assistant state's attorney isn't your style.
All right.
Suppose a certain irresponsible young man... took it upon himself to do this thing.
Supposing that was the case, that's not your business.
Langley was my friend.
Did you know he was looking into our affairs?
I could have protected you legally.
Beautiful conformation.
Listen, Jean.
You helped with the firm, you've been very generous... but I cannot represent these people anymore.
These people are me, Larry.
I realize your personal involvement here will pass.
No, I don't think so.
After these many years... is it a matter of conscience?
It's very simple, I want out.
Now.
I mean it, Jean.
That's impossible, Larry.
If Sagot is charged with anything further...
I know you will take care of him.
Crockett, you're in early this morning.
I see you didn't get any sleep last night, either.
Langley was good people.
At least he played by the rules.
You grab any breakfast?
We got a briefing in a half hour.
What briefing?
Lieutenant wants an eyewitness report on what happened last night... in the strategy room.
You saw what I saw.
Can you handle it for me?
If I have to.
And if he asks for you?
Tell him I went to see my therapist.
300 out of 300.
I'm impressed, Crockett.
Set them up again.
Again?
Set them up again, I want to run it.
Okay, Tommy, what's the story this time?
Sonny boy, are you familiar with the expression...
"a carburetor is like a good woman"?
Tommy.
A carburetor is like a good woman because... if you don't make constant delicate adjustments, she'll choke you to death.
I adjusted your carbs and I did some other stuff... and the ticket's on the front seat.
Wait a minute.
What other stuff?
Sonny, when did I ever, ever, ever overcharge you?
How the hell should I know?
You're the only one that works on this car!
I'm the best, Sonny, it's a fact.
Tommy?
You rang?
$600?
You want to know something, Crockett?
Not if it's gonna cost me another $600.
I'm doing pretty much the same work on this car here... but this car belongs to a rich lawyer.
I'm charging him more.
Fair, but more.
And if you tell him, I'll kill you.
Why should I tell him?
Well, he said he was a friend of yours.
The rich lawyer, Thurmond.
Great.
Yeah, Crockett.
The man responsible for the death... of State's Attorney Richard Langley... is Philippe Sagot.
He was arrested last night for possession of narcotics.
Who is this?
Hello.
Philippe Sagot's file.
Zito yanked him out of a fight at that French Canadian joint last night.
I was thinking we could run down the guys he was fighting with.
Well, the hit man had curly hair and a moustache.
Maybe a disguise.
You have nothing.
Just an anonymous tip.
Homicide's got less.
I want to chase it.
Briefly.
Yeah, get me Zito.
A little item here you didn't mention to Castillo.
What's that?
When Zito bagged Sagot... the guy he used to defend him was Larry Thurmond.
Zito.
You're wasting my time.
I haven't seen Sagot in months.
How many times do I have to tell you this, guys?
I haven't seen Sagot in months, maybe a year.
How's your neck, Marcel?
Remember this guy?
I think the last time you saw him, you were something like this, weren't you?
Like that?
Now if you've got something to say, pal, you better spit it out.
Who made the call, Marcel?
If you're holding back on me, pal, you and I are gonna have a real problem.
You don't understand.
Sagot is crazy.
Crazy enough to kill Langley at his daughter's wedding?
Maybe.
What do you mean, maybe?
What are you saying?
Hey, Crockett.
Man, come on, be cool.
Hey, be cool.
What are you saying, man?
I just said maybe.
I don't want to say nothing else until I have my lawyer.
Look, we're gonna protect you.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Right.
Like you protected your attorney?
No, merci.
Get him out of here.
I'm getting too old for these games.
Yeah.
I think Sagot is our man.
And it should have been homicide's case.
Here we are, back at square one.
No evidence and nobody left to talk to.
Except Thurmond.
Well, what's he gonna tell us?
No.
I'm gonna tell him... that we think his ex-client murdered his best friend.
It looks good.
Thanks.
It's really been crazy around here with the opening and all.
You know, I forgot I have to be downtown in a few minutes, I....
Larry, why did you call?
Come on, this was the deal breaker in the divorce.
And I found this in one of my casebooks.
I know you don't like photographs of yourself, but....
The only fish I ever caught.
Larry, is everything really okay?
How's the practice?
It's not everything anymore.
Well, maybe there should be a law that we have to be 38... before we make the decisions we make when we're 28.
Good idea.
And I bet you Larry's just the guy to come up with the precedent for it.
What are you doing here?
Detective, you two still at it?
If you'd return your calls, you'd know.
Can't it wait?
No.
Sorry, Alecia.
I have to be going anyway, Larry.
Thanks for everything, really.
I'll try calling you later, okay?
Take care.
What?
Your client, Philippe Sagot.
My former client.
Whatever.
I think he's gonna need your services again.
We got a tip.
We checked it out with some people.
He killed Langley.
And?
What do you mean, "and"?
That's all you have for evidence?
A tip and some hearsay?
I'm telling you that he's our number one suspect.
Does it matter to you at all that, through your manipulations of the system... you cut loose the guy who killed your best friend?
Yeah, it matters to me.
Now what do you expect me to do about it?
Nothing.
Not a damn thing.
What did you do?
Did you trade in your conscience when you passed the bar?
You've been running up a big phone bill.
Thurmond met with him at Le Loup.
They talked for approximately an hour at the beach... and then we lost Sagot after he dropped Thurmond back at the club.
We figure that Thurmond told Sagot we got a tip... which explains why Marcel got hit last night.
Interesting theory.
Bring me a case.
Someone dropped a dime on me.
It had to be Marcel.
I don't give a damn about Marcel.
I care about the business, the heat you're attracting.
What heat?
The cops can't touch me.
They pop me now and they blow their case.
They got no probable cause.
Where did you hear that?
From Thurmond.
He came by last night to set me down.
He says, "In case anything goes down...."
I told him everything about the hit.
He says they got no hard evidence.
So I got nothing to worry about.
I don't care what he says.
I want you to disappear for a while.
Bien.
Make it soon.
Forget him.
I want Thurmond taken care of.
A little joy ride, Mr. Thurmond?
No.
A little high-altitude meditation.
Very pretty, mademoiselle.
In case I lose you cops, here's our afternoon.
Bal Harbor to buy some luggage... then down to the Palms for a haircut, just a little trim on the edge.
If you think I need it.
Take everything off above the neck.
I'm taking a little plane trip out of the country tomorrow.
What do you say you come along as a carryon luggage?
Why don't you stick around?
We'll send you on a vacation.
I'll send you a postcard.
Do you think this guy practices at being a tubesteak?
What did you do trade in your conscience... when you passed the bar?
He killed Langley.
You cut loose the guy that killed your best friend?
Now what do you expect me to do about it?
They couldn't even find Thurmond's body.
The way those currents are out there, I'm surprised they found anything at all.
Any mention of sabotage?
There wasn't enough left.
Maybe Thurmond and his clients weren't as tight as you think.
I'm out of this pop stand.
Looks like Sagot's gonna make that plane.
Night all.
Good night, Trudy.
Trudy....
Keep dreaming.
Crockett.
Hello?
Copy all this down very carefully... and you will have enough to convict Philippe Sagot... for the murder of Richard Langley.
Put a trace on this call.
Another tip.
Same guy, same voice.
This is Tubbs.
I need a pen register on our office line, ext. 220.
The gun that he used was a .9 mm, semi-automatic pistol.
It is now in a safe-deposit box at first Miami... on 51st, under the name of Collier.
The caterer's uniform was stolen a week before the murder... from the Benton Caterer's at 3100 Princeton Avenue.
We got it.
I was off when these fellows checked in, so I ain't never seen them.
Hey, it's okay, Lucy, baby, it's only the police.
He has a problem with cops.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, Crockett, come here.
He calls from anywhere and triggers the calls.
Smart dude.
Copy all this down very carefully... and you will have enough to convict Philippe Sagot... for the murder of Richard Langley.
Man, this is taking too long.
Relax, man.
Zito should have a warrant any minute.
Yeah, he should.
Then he's still got to drill the box at the bank.
How much time we got?
According to the travel agent...
Sagot's plane leaves at 9:15.
Great, that leaves us a whole 45 minutes.
Man, if it was up to me I'd grab him, gun or no gun.
State attorney says we need the gun for probable cause.
This guy killed Langley, Lieutenant, and if we let him get on that plane... we got a chance in hell of him coming back.
Yeah?
Then he's gone.
Zito's got the warrant.
He's on the way to the bank.
Crockett, don't move in until Zito I.D# s the gun.
Get me backup!
Man, oh, man, how long can it take to drill a safe-deposit box?
I don't know.
Zito better get his act together soon.
He spotted me.
You better do something in a hurry.
Everybody stay cool, I'll tell you when.
Yeah?
Sonny, we got the gun.
Everybody, go!
Everybody, go!
This is the police.
Cut your engines and stop the boat.
Cut your engines, or we will fire.
Blink and you're mine.
Trout and white wine, that's all I'm eating for a week.
Tommy, I need the story on this car right now.
God, it's terrible.
Young guy, had everything going for him.
Boom, gonesville.
Yeah, when Thurmond came in, did he say anything or do anything weird?
Well, he paid me up-front, that was pretty weird.
And he said if he wasn't back in a couple of days to pick up the car... that I should call this Alecia woman and have her pick up the car... which I am going to do first thing after lunch.
Tommy, come on now, was there anything else?
As a matter of fact, yeah.
He said you guys should be coming by and would I give you a package.
So the messenger delivered it.
I signed for it.
Where?
I signed for it here.
Where?
The package, where is it?
It's in the front seat where I keep the tickets.
He's giving us Faber.
He's giving us the whole operation.
Signed affidavits.
We got enough here to put him away for 25 years.
Thurmond is alive.
Yeah.
Now we're gonna find him and bring him back.
This time he's gonna be a witness, pal.
Yeah.
Thanks, Tommy.
See you.
What's the matter with you?
Save it for your new lawyer, Faber.
We've got the book on you.
Read him his rights.
He's gonna need them.
I still can't believe it.
No one else could have made those calls... no one else knew what he knew.
You said the last phone call came after the crash.
Larry couldn't have placed the call.
Yes.
But he could have recorded the message earlier... and then anyone could have triggered the machine.
What difference would that make now?
Not a lot, unless that plane crash was no accident.
I don't think it was.
He came by to say good-bye.
What do you mean?
The day you came here... he came by out of the blue to bring me this present.
And he gave me this.
The happiest I've ever seen him was on this dumb island.
Where was this?
Rum Cay.
It's near Bimini.
Thank you.
I mean, if you wanted to really cool out... wouldn't you pick the one place that turns you on?
Yeah, I would have bet the farm.
Three laps around this sandbox is enough for me.
How?
Yeah, let's pick it up where you parachuted.
J A rubber raft to Bimini seaplane to here.
I can't go back.
Guess again, bucko.
Didn't I give you enough evidence to put Sagot and Faber away?
Yeah.
But you know what they say in law school:
"Nothing beats live testimony."
Crockett I gave up everything.
If you're looking for sympathy from me, buddy... you're knocking on the wrong door.
You chose your clients.
Yeah, you're right.
It got so that I couldn't look at myself in the mirror anymore.
That, and the fact that I was settling an old score... with a guy that I always thought was a good cop.
I'll get my things.
You think this makes us even?
No, not at all.
It's just the best that I had to offer.
The hell with it.
You want to be dead?
Bang.
You're dead.

[Music playing]
[People chattering]
[Inaudible]
Thank you, it's wonderful to see you.
You look very beautiful.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Mr. Prosecutor.
Larry.
It was a lovely wedding, you should be very proud.
Even got a little choked up there for a minute myself.
You?
There's not a judge in town that will believe that.
Now, don't use it against me in court, huh?
Buy you a drink.
We can't leave without saying good-bye.
Robert, we're on our way.
Just wanted to say congratulations and thanks.
So soon?
Yeah.
Can't have too good a time.
Everybody back at the monastery gets jealous.
[Tubbs laughing]
Here's the father of the bride.
It's picture time.
How can I refuse?
How are you, Crockett?
[People screaming]
[Guns firing]
[Camera clicking]
(policeman) Those that have given their statements are free to go.
We ask you not to discuss your statements with anyone else or any other witnesses.
(Thurmond) Crockett... if there's anything I can do to help...
Sure.
If we catch the guy, I'll give him your number.
What is your problem?
I don't dig seeing my friends get killed.
Or don't you remember?
Langley and I were very close.
Yeah?
How close were you to Grainy?
I was this close.
What's this got to do with Grainy?
I filed a motion, the judge declared a mistrial.
Take it up with him.
Don't read me the record, pal.
There aren't any technicalities to hide behind on the street.
I had to stand there and watch Grainy bleed to death.
[Sighing]
Your partner's got some great timing.
How about we shelve this till after the funeral?
[People murmuring]
You want to fill me in?
I was showing the ropes to this... this new kid, Grainy, a few years ago.
It was our first week under.
Our first week.
[Sighing]
We were working some Rastas.
They tried to pull a rip.
The kid got nervous...
They shot him in the face twice with a.45.
I collared the guy and tuned him up a bit.
Mr. "Hotshot" Thurmond... got him a mistrial on some... shaky, due process rap.
The guy just had a kid.
His wife freaked.
It was a nightmare.
Come on, Sonny, let's get out of here.
Yeah, all right.
Let me give this supplemental to homicide.
The word from the hospital confirms what you've already heard.
Assistant State Attorney Richard Langley is dead.
(Gina) He was one of us.
He used to open doors for me at the courthouse.
I liked him.
Two other people were killed along with Langley.
Sisters, in their teens.
Bridesmaids in a wedding they were all attending.
Crockett and Tubbs are still on the scene.
Any I.D. On the shooter?
Caucasian male, but no positive I.D.
Who would want to kill Langley?
Was it something personal?
(Martin) No.
Then what?
Richard Langley, for the past six months, has been guiding the D.E.A. Efforts... to bring pressure against Jean Faber's outfit.
French Canadian connection.
Is Faber that crazy he'd put a hit out on a state's attorney?
Le Loup, a nightclub up by Fort Lauderdale.
State's attorney's office says that Faber's people have been spotted there.
I want you to work it, hard.
[People chattering] ['80s pop music playing]
It was you.
It was you, wasn't it?
Are you crazy, man?
What are you talking about?
[Scoffing]
If you think Faber is going to approve of this...
That's not your business, is it?
You ever killed a man, Marcel?
No, you don't have the guts.
No guts in there at all.
Hey.
Come on, tough guy, show me.
[Speaking French]
Not here.
[People chattering]
[Shouts]
Parlez-vous français?
Polly want a cracker?
You ain't got nothing on me.
Nothing.
Oh, yeah, but you've got something on you.
Qu'est-ce que c'est, buddy?
You're under arrest for the possession of narcotics.
[Laughing]
Possession?
You made my night.
Well, you have the right to remain silent.
Hey, come on, one gram.
It's a joke.
You're a lawyer, figure something out.
What about the actual arrest?
Did he fail to read you your rights, or threaten you in anyway?
Nice suit, very nice.
I should be out of here by now.
I don't like to speak no evil of the dead, but you become a crusader like Langley... and things are bound to happen, know what I mean?
(Thurmond) You're talking about murder here.
Three people.
Two of them teenagers.
Yeah, well, what do you expect?
Twins are bad luck.
Twins?
How do you know they were twins?
I read it in the papers.
The paper only said they were sisters.
Maybe I heard it on the radio.
Where were you last night before Le Loup?
I was having dinner at Duke's.
Hey, where do you get off asking me that?
Just do the job Faber is paying you to do, understand?
Just do your damn job.
Keep the reins tight, Marcie, so he knows where to go.
Won't that hurt his mouth?
No, Popcorn wants you to tell him what to do.
Like all your boyfriends will when you grow up.
Bonjour, Monsieur Thurmond.
Hi, princess.
Larry.
I know I'm interrupting.
No, I wish you'd come by more often.
Speculating isn't your style.
Even Sagot's alibi about being at Duke's is phony, Jean.
And murdering two children and an assistant state's attorney isn't your style.
All right.
[Horses neighing]
Suppose a certain irresponsible young man... took it upon himself to do this thing.
Supposing that was the case, that's not your business.
Langley was my friend.
[Sighing]
Did you know he was looking into our affairs?
I could have protected you legally.
Beautiful conformation.
[Horses neighing]
Listen, Jean.
You helped with the firm, you've been very generous... but I cannot represent these people anymore.
These people are me, Larry.
I realize your personal involvement here will pass.
No, I don't think so.
After these many years... is it a matter of conscience?
It's very simple, I want out.
Now.
I mean it, Jean.
That's impossible, Larry.
If Sagot is charged with anything further...
I know you will take care of him.
Crockett, you're in early this morning.
I see you didn't get any sleep last night, either.
Langley was good people.
At least he played by the rules.
You grab any breakfast?
We got a briefing in a half hour.
What briefing?
Lieutenant wants an eyewitness report on what happened last night... in the strategy room.
[Sighing]
You saw what I saw.
Can you handle it for me?
(Tubbs) If I have to.
And if he asks for you?
Tell him I went to see my therapist.
[Plane engine roaring]
[Face To Face playing]
[Gun fires]
300 out of 300.
I'm impressed, Crockett.
Set them up again.
Again?
Set them up again, I want to run it.
[Mustang Sally playing]
Okay, Tommy, what's the story this time?
Sonny boy, are you familiar with the expression...
"a carburetor is like a good woman"?
Tommy.
A carburetor is like a good woman because... if you don't make constant delicate adjustments, she'll choke you to death.
I adjusted your carbs and I did some other stuff... and the ticket's on the front seat.
Wait a minute.
What other stuff?
Sonny, when did I ever, ever, ever overcharge you?
How the hell should I know?
You're the only one that works on this car!
I'm the best, Sonny, it's a fact.
Tommy?
You rang?
$600?
You want to know something, Crockett?
Not if it's gonna cost me another $600.
I'm doing pretty much the same work on this car here... but this car belongs to a rich lawyer.
I'm charging him more.
Fair, but more.
And if you tell him, I'll kill you.
Why should I tell him?
Well, he said he was a friend of yours.
The rich lawyer, Thurmond.
Great.
[Phone ringing]
Yeah, Crockett.
(man) The man responsible for the death... of State's Attorney Richard Langley... is Philippe Sagot.
He was arrested last night for possession of narcotics.
Who is this?
Hello.
[Dial tone buzzing]
Philippe Sagot's file.
Zito yanked him out of a fight at that French Canadian joint last night.
I was thinking we could run down the guys he was fighting with.
Well, the hit man had curly hair and a moustache.
Maybe a disguise.
You have nothing.
Just an anonymous tip.
[Sighing]
Homicide's got less.
I want to chase it.
Briefly.
Yeah, get me Zito.
A little item here you didn't mention to Castillo.
What's that?
When Zito bagged Sagot... the guy he used to defend him was Larry Thurmond.
Zito.
You're wasting my time.
I haven't seen Sagot in months.
How many times do I have to tell you this, guys?
I haven't seen Sagot in months, maybe a year.
How's your neck, Marcel?
Remember this guy?
I think the last time you saw him, you were something like this, weren't you?
Like that?
Now if you've got something to say, pal, you better spit it out.
[Sighing]
(Tubbs) Who made the call, Marcel?
If you're holding back on me, pal, you and I are gonna have a real problem.
You don't understand.
Sagot is crazy.
Crazy enough to kill Langley at his daughter's wedding?
Maybe.
What do you mean, maybe?
What are you saying?
Hey, Crockett.
Man, come on, be cool.
Hey, be cool.
What are you saying, man?
I just said maybe.
I don't want to say nothing else until I have my lawyer.
Look, we're gonna protect you.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Right.
Like you protected your attorney?
No, merci.
Get him out of here.
[Sighing]
[Door closing]
I'm getting too old for these games.
Yeah.
I think Sagot is our man.
And it should have been homicide's case.
Here we are, back at square one.
No evidence and nobody left to talk to.
Except Thurmond.
Well, what's he gonna tell us?
No.
I'm gonna tell him... that we think his ex-client murdered his best friend.
It looks good.
Thanks.
It's really been crazy around here with the opening and all.
You know, I forgot I have to be downtown in a few minutes, I...
Larry, why did you call?
Come on, this was the deal breaker in the divorce.
[Sighing]
And I found this in one of my casebooks.
I know you don't like photographs of yourself, but... [chuckles]
The only fish I ever caught.
Larry, is everything really okay?
How's the practice?
It's not everything anymore.
Well, maybe there should be a law that we have to be 38... before we make the decisions we make when we're 28.
(Crockett) Good idea.
And I bet you Larry's just the guy to come up with the precedent for it.
What are you doing here?
Detective, you two still at it?
If you'd return your calls, you'd know.
Can't it wait?
No.
Sorry, Alecia.
I have to be going anyway, Larry.
Thanks for everything, really.
I'll try calling you later, okay?
Take care.
What?
Your client, Philippe Sagot.
My former client.
Whatever.
I think he's gonna need your services again.
We got a tip.
We checked it out with some people.
He killed Langley.
And?
What do you mean, "and"?
That's all you have for evidence?
A tip and some hearsay?
I'm telling you that he's our number one suspect.
Does it matter to you at all that, through your manipulations of the system... you cut loose the guy who killed your best friend?
Yeah, it matters to me.
Now what do you expect me to do about it?
Nothing.
Not a damn thing.
What did you do?
Did you trade in your conscience when you passed the bar?
[Coughing]
You've been running up a big phone bill.
Thurmond met with him at Le Loup.
They talked for approximately an hour at the beach... and then we lost Sagot after he dropped Thurmond back at the club.
We figure that Thurmond told Sagot we got a tip... which explains why Marcel got hit last night.
Interesting theory.
Bring me a case.
[Speaking French]
Someone dropped a dime on me.
It had to be Marcel.
I don't give a damn about Marcel.
I care about the business, the heat you're attracting.
What heat?
The cops can't touch me.
They pop me now and they blow their case.
They got no probable cause.
Where did you hear that?
From Thurmond.
He came by last night to set me down.
He says, "In case anything goes down..."
I told him everything about the hit.
He says they got no hard evidence.
So I got nothing to worry about.
I don't care what he says.
I want you to disappear for a while.
Bien.
Make it soon.
[Horse neighing]
Forget him.
I want Thurmond taken care of.
A little joy ride, Mr. Thurmond?
No.
A little high-altitude meditation.
[Music playing on car stereo]
Very pretty, mademoiselle.
In case I lose you cops, here's our afternoon.
Bal Harbor to buy some luggage... then down to the Palms for a haircut, just a little trim on the edge.
If you think I need it.
Take everything off above the neck.
I'm taking a little plane trip out of the country tomorrow.
What do you say you come along as a carryon luggage?
Why don't you stick around?
We'll send you on a vacation.
I'll send you a postcard.
[Tires squealing]
Do you think this guy practices at being a tubesteak?
(Crockett) What did you do trade in your conscience... when you passed the bar?
He killed Langley.
You cut loose the guy that killed your best friend?
(Thurmond) Now what do you expect me to do about it?
(Stan) They couldn't even find Thurmond's body.
The way those currents are out there, I'm surprised they found anything at all.
Any mention of sabotage?
There wasn't enough left.
Maybe Thurmond and his clients weren't as tight as you think.
I'm out of this pop stand.
Looks like Sagot's gonna make that plane.
(Trudy) Night all.
Good night, Trudy.
(Tubbs) Trudy... (Trudy) Keep dreaming.
[Phone ringing]
Crockett.
Hello?
(man) Copy all this down very carefully... and you will have enough to convict Philippe Sagot... for the murder of Richard Langley.
Put a trace on this call.
(Crockett) Another tip.
Same guy, same voice.
This is Tubbs.
I need a pen register on our office line, ext. 220.
(man) The gun that he used was a.9 mm, semi-automatic pistol.
It is now in a safe-deposit box at First Miami... on 51st, under the name of Collier.
The caterer's uniform was stolen a week before the murder... from the Benton Caterer's at 3100 Princeton Avenue.
[Dial tone buzzing]
We got it.
[Elevator bell dings]
I was off when these fellows checked in, so I ain't never seen them.
[Cat meowing]
Hey, it's okay, Lucy, baby, it's only the police.
He has a problem with cops.
[Knocking at door]
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, Crockett, come here.
(Tubbs) He calls from anywhere and triggers the calls.
Smart dude.
[Switch clicks]
(man) Copy all this down very carefully... and you will have enough to convict Philippe Sagot... for the murder of Richard Langley.
Man, this is taking too long.
Relax, man.
Zito should have a warrant any minute.
Yeah, he should.
Then he's still got to drill the box at the bank.
How much time we got?
According to the travel agent...
Sagot's plane leaves at 9:15.
Great, that leaves us a whole 45 minutes.
Man, if it was up to me I'd grab him, gun or no gun.
State attorney says we need the gun for probable cause.
This guy killed Langley, Lieutenant, and if we let him get on that plane... we got a chance in hell of him coming back.
[Phone ringing]
(Stan) Yeah?
Then he's gone.
Zito's got the warrant.
He's on the way to the bank.
Crockett, don't move in until Zito I.D.'s the gun.
Get me backup!
Man, oh, man, how long can it take to drill a safe-deposit box?
I don't know.
Zito better get his act together soon.
He spotted me.
You better do something in a hurry.
Everybody stay cool, I'll tell you when.
[Plane engine hums]
Yeah?
(Larry) Sonny, we got the gun.
Everybody, go!
Everybody, go!
[Tires screeching]
[Police siren wailing]
(Officer #1) This is the police.
Cut your engines and stop the boat.
Cut your engines, or we will fire.
Blink and you're mine.
Trout and white wine, that's all I'm eating for a week.
Tommy, I need the story on this car right now.
God, it's terrible.
Young guy, had everything going for him.
Boom, gonesville.
Yeah, when Thurmond came in, did he say anything or do anything weird?
Well, he paid me up-front, that was pretty weird.
And he said if he wasn't back in a couple of days to pick up the car... that I should call this Alecia woman and have her pick up the car... which I am going to do first thing after lunch.
Tommy, come on now, was there anything else?
As a matter of fact, yeah.
He said you guys should be coming by and would I give you a package.
So the messenger delivered it.
I signed for it.
Where?
I signed for it here.
Where?
The package, where is it?
It's in the front seat where I keep the tickets.
He's giving us Faber.
He's giving us the whole operation.
Signed affidavits.
(Crockett) We got enough here to put him away for 25 years.
Thurmond is alive.
Yeah.
Now we're gonna find him and bring him back.
This time he's gonna be a witness, pal.
Yeah.
Thanks, Tommy.
(Tommy) See you.
(Faber) What's the matter with you?
(Crockett) Save it for your new lawyer, Faber.
We've got the book on you.
(Crockett) Read him his rights.
He's gonna need them.
I still can't believe it.
(Crockett) No one else could have made those calls... no one else knew what he knew.
You said the last phone call came after the crash.
(Alecia) Larry couldn't have placed the call.
Yes.
But he could have recorded the message earlier... and then anyone could have triggered the machine.
What difference would that make now?
Not a lot, unless that plane crash was no accident.
I don't think it was.
He came by to say good-bye.
What do you mean?
The day you came here... he came by out of the blue to bring me this present.
And he gave me this.
The happiest I've ever seen him was on this dumb island.
Where was this?
Rum Cay.
It's near Bimini.
Thank you.
[Birds chirping]
I mean, if you wanted to really cool out... wouldn't you pick the one place that turns you on?
Yeah, I would have bet the farm.
Three laps around this sandbox is enough for me.
How?
Yeah, let's pick it up where you parachuted.
A rubber raft to Bimini, seaplane to here.
I can't go back.
Guess again, bucko.
Didn't I give you enough evidence to put Sagot and Faber away?
Yeah.
But you know what they say in law school:
"Nothing beats live testimony."
Crockett, I gave up everything.
If you're looking for sympathy from me, buddy... you're knocking on the wrong door.
(Crockett) You chose your clients.
Yeah, you're right.
It got so that I couldn't look at myself in the mirror anymore.
That, and the fact that I was settling an old score... with a guy that I always thought was a good cop.
I'll get my things.
[Water splashing]
You think this makes us even?
No, not at all.
It's just the best that I had to offer.
The hell with it.
You want to be dead?
Bang.
You're dead.
##[church organ playing]
Friends, we are gathered here on this occasion... to join together this young man and woman in the bonds of holy matrimony.
(Minister) This is both a joyous and serious occasion.
The exchange of rings is symbolic of the bonds of matrimony... one that signifies a transformation of your individual selves... as God's picked representatives of....
(Minister) ...purified and beloved of God, himself.
As the ring encircles your finger, Iet love encircle your heart.
...kindness, humble in mind.
If there is anyone present who knows any reason... why this man and this woman should not be joined.... ...and be most patient....
(Minister) Guide them by your word... to serve you all the days of their lives.
Dear Lord, strengthen Deborah and Michael with the gift of your spirit.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
##[music playing]

Thank you, it's wonderful to see you.
You look very beautiful.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Mr. Prosecutor.
Larry.
It was a lovely wedding, you should be very proud.
Even got a little choked up there for a minute myself.
You?
There's not a judge in town that will believe that.
Now, don't use it against me in court, huh?
Buy you a drink.
We can't leave without saying good-bye.
Robert, we're on our way.
Just wanted to say congratulations and thanks.

(man) The man responsíble for the death... oF State's Attorney Ríchard Langley... ís Phílíppe Sagot.
He was arrested last níght for possessíon of narcotícs.
Who is this?
Hello.
[díal tone buzzíngJ
Philippe Sagot's file.
Zito yanked him out of a fight at that French Canadian joint last night.
I was thinking we could run down the guys he was fighting with.
Well, the hit man had curly hair and a moustache.
Maybe a disguise.
You have nothing.
Just an anonymous tip.
[sighing]
Homicide's got less.
I want to chase it.
Briefly.
Yeah, get me Zito.
A little item here you didn't mention to Castillo.
What's that?
When Zito bagged Sagot... the guy he used to defend him was Larry Thurmond.
Zito.
You're wasting my time.
I haven't seen Sagot in months.
How many times do I have to tell you this, guys?
I haven't seen Sagot in months, maybe a year.
How's your neck, Marcel?
Remember this guy?
I think the last time you saw him, you were something like this, weren't you?
Like that?
Now if you've got something to say, pal, you better spit it out.
[sighing]
(Tubbs) Who made the call, Marcel?
If you're holding back on me, pal, you and I are gonna have a real problem.
You don't understand.
Sagot is crazy.
Crazy enough to kill Langley at his daughter's wedding?
Maybe.
What do you mean, maybe?
What are you saying?
Hey, Crockett.
Man, come on, be cool.
Hey, be cool.
What are you saying, man?
I just said maybe.
I don't want to say nothing else until I have my lawyer.
Look, we're gonna protect you.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Right.
Like you protected your attorney?
No, mercí.
Get him out of here.
[sighing] [door closing] I'm getting too old for these games.
Yeah.
I think Sagot is our man.
And it should have been homicide's case.
Here we are, back at square one.
No evidence and nobody left to talk to.
Except Thurmond.
Well, what's he gonna tell us?
No. I'm gonna tell him... that we think his ex-client murdered his best friend.
It looks good.
Thanks.
It's really been crazy around here with the opening and all.
You know, I forgot I have to be downtown in a few minutes, I....
Larry, why did you call?
Come on, this was the deal breaker in the divorce.
[sighing]
And I found this in one of my casebooks.
I know you don't like photographs of yourself, but.... [chuckles]
The only fish I ever caught.
Larry, is everything really okay?
How's the practice?
It's not everything anymore.
Well, maybe there should be a law that we have to be 38... before we make the decisions we make when we're 28.
(Crockett) Good idea.
And I bet you Larry's just the guy to come up with the precedent for it.
What are you doing here?
Detective, you two still at it?
If you'd return your calls, you'd know.
Can't it wait?
No.
Sorry, Alecia.
I have to be going anyway, Larry.
Thanks for everything, really.
I'll try calling you later, okay?
Take care.
What?
Your client, Philippe Sagot.
My former client.
Whatever.
I think he's gonna need your services again.
We got a tip.
We checked it out with some people.
He killed Langley.
And?
What do you mean, "and"?
That's all you have for evidence?
A tip and some hearsay?
I'm telling you that he's our number one suspect.
Does it matter to you at all that, through your manipulations of the system... you cut loose the guy who killed your best friend?
Yeah, it matters to me.
Now what do you expect me to do about it?
Nothing.
Not a damn thing.
What did you do?
Did you trade in your conscience when you passed the bar?
[coughing]
You've been running up a big phone bill.
Thurmond met with him at Le Loup.
They talked for approximately an hour at the beach... and then we lost Sagot after he dropped Thurmond back at the club.
We figure that Thurmond told Sagot we got a tip... which explains why Marcel got hit last night.
Interesting theory.
Bring me a case.
[speaking French]
Someone dropped a dime on me.
It had to be Marcel.
I don't give a damn about Marcel.
I care about the business, the heat you're attracting.
What heat?
The cops can't touch me.
They pop me now and they blow their case.
They got no probable cause.
Where did you hear that?
From Thurmond.
He came by last night to set me down.
He says, "ln case anything goes down...."
I told him everything about the hit.
He says they got no hard evidence.
So I got nothing to worry about.
I don't care what he says.
I want you to disappear for a while.
Bíen.
Make it soon.
[horse neighing]
Forget him.
I want Thurmond taken care of.
A little joy ride, Mr. Thurmond?
No.
A little high-altitude meditation.
##[music playing on car stereo]
Very pretty, mademoíselle.
In case I lose you cops, here's our afternoon.
Bal Harbor to buy some luggage... then down to the Palms for a haircut, just a little trim on the edge.
If you think I need it.
Take everything off above the neck.
I'm taking a little plane trip out of the country tomorrow.
What do you say you come along as a carryon luggage?
Why don't you stick around?
We'll send you on a vacation.
I'll send you a postcard.
[tires squealing]
Do you think this guy practices at being a tubesteak?
(Crockett) What díd you do trade ín your conscíence... when you passed the bar?
He kílled Langley.
You cut loose the guy that kílled your best fríend?
(Thurmond) Now what do you expect me to do about ít?
(Stan) They couldn't even find Thurmond's body.
The way those currents are out there, I'm surprised they found anything at all.
Any mention of sabotage?
There wasn't enough left.
Maybe Thurmond and his clients weren't as tight as you think.
I'm out of this pop stand.
Looks like Sagot's gonna make that plane.
(Trudy) Night all.
Good night, Trudy.
(Tubbs) Trudy.... (Trudy) Keep dreaming.
[phone ringing]
Crockett.
Hello?
(man) Copy all thís down very carefully... and you wíll have enough to convíct Phílíppe Sagot... for the murder of Ríchard Langley.
Put a trace on this call.
(Crockett) Another tip.
Same guy, same voice.
This is Tubbs.
I need a pen register on our office line, ext. 220.
(man) The gun that he used was a .9 mm, semí-automatíc pístol.
It ís now ín a safe-deposít box at fírst Míamí... on 51st, under the name of Collíer.
The caterer's uníform was stolen a week before the murder... from the Benton Caterer's at 3100 Prínceton Avenue.
[díal tone buzzíngJ
We got it.
[elevator bell dings] I was off when these fellows checked in, so I ain't never seen them.
[cat meowing]
Hey, it's okay, Lucy, baby, it's only the police.
He has a problem with cops.
[knocking at door]
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey, Crockett, come here.
(Tubbs) He calls from anywhere and triggers the calls.
Smart dude.
[switch clicks]
(man) Copy all thís down very carefully... and you wíll have enough to convíct Phílíppe Sagot... for the murder of Ríchard Langley.
Man, this is taking too long.
Relax, man.
Zito should have a warrant any minute.
Yeah, he should.
Then he's still got to drill the box at the bank.
How much time we got?
According to the travel agent...
Sagot's plane leaves at 9:15.
Great, that leaves us a whole 45 minutes.
Man, if it was up to me I'd grab him, gun or no gun.
State attorney says we need the gun for probable cause.
This guy killed Langley, Lieutenant, and if we let him get on that plane... we got a chance in hell of him coming back.
[phone ringing]
(Stan) Yeah?
Then he's gone.
Zito's got the warrant.
He's on the way to the bank.
Crockett, don't move in until Zito l.D# s the gun.
Get me backup!
Man, oh, man, how long can it take to drill a safe-deposit box?
I don't know.
Zito better get his act together soon.
He spotted me.
You better do something in a hurry.
Everybody stay cool, I'll tell you when.
[plane engine hums]
Yeah?
(Larry) Sonny, we got the gun.
Everybody, go!
Everybody, go!
[tires screeching]
[police siren wailing]
(Offícer #1) Thís ís the políce.
Cut your engínes and stop the boat.
Cut your engínes, or we wíll fíre.
Blink and you're mine.
Trout and white wine, that's all I'm eating for a week.
Tommy, I need the story on this car right now.
God, it's terrible.
Young guy, had everything going for him.
Boom, gonesville.
Yeah, when Thurmond came in, did he say anything or do anything weird?
Well, he paid me up-front, that was pretty weird.
And he said if he wasn't back in a couple of days to pick up the car... that I should call this Alecia woman and have her pick up the car... which I am going to do first thing after lunch.
Tommy, come on now, was there anything else?
As a matter of fact, yeah.
He said you guys should be coming by and would I give you a package.
So the messenger delivered it.
I signed for it.
Where?
I signed for it here.
Where?
The package, where is it?
It's in the front seat where l keep the tickets.
He's giving us Faber.
He's giving us the whole operation.
Signed affidavits.
(Crockett) We got enough here to put him away for 25 years.
Thurmond is alive.
Yeah.
Now we're gonna find him and bring him back.
This time he's gonna be a witness, pal.
Yeah.
Thanks, Tommy.
(Tommy) See you.
(Faber) What's the matter with you?
(Crockett) Save it for your new lawyer, Faber.
We've got the book on you.
(Crockett) Read him his rights.
He's gonna need them.
I still can't believe it.
(Crockett) No one else could have made those calls... no one else knew what he knew.
You said the last phone call came after the crash.
(Alecia) Larry couldn't have placed the call.
Yes.
But he could have recorded the message earlier... and then anyone could have triggered the machine.
What difference would that make now?
Not a lot, unless that plane crash was no accident.
I don't think it was.
He came by to say good-bye.
What do you mean?
The day you came here... he came by out of the blue to bring me this present.
And he gave me this.
The happiest I've ever seen him was on this dumb island.
Where was this?
Rum Cay.
It's near Bimini.
Thank you.
[birds chirping]
I mean, if you wanted to really cool out... wouldn't you pick the one place that turns you on?
Yeah, I would have bet the farm.
Three laps around this sandbox is enough for me.
How?
Yeah, let's pick it up where you parachuted.
J A rubber raft to Bimini seaplane to here.
I can't go back.
Guess again, bucko.
Didn't I give you enough evidence to put Sagot and Faber away?
Yeah.
But you know what they say in law school:
"Nothing beats live testimony."
Crockett I gave up everything.
If you're looking for sympathy from me, buddy... you're knocking on the wrong door.
(Crockett) You chose your clients.
Yeah, you're right.
It got so that I couldn't look at myself in the mirror anymore.
That, and the fact that I was settling an old score... with a guy that I always thought was a good cop.
I'll get my things.
[water splashing]
You think this makes us even?
No, not at all.
It's lust the best that I had to offer.
The hell with it.
You want to be dead?
Bang.
You're dead.
[Cheering, Shouting]
?
[Rock]
?
[Man Singing]
[Crockett] You got a happenin'place here, Mack.
I love Miami, man.
It's like a cultural renaissance, huh?
Come on, Henry.
You gotta loosen up, man.
This woman is "no" interested in your I.Q., man.
[Spanish]
I've seen this kind of mental block before, man.
Happens to all great artists.
Happened to Hemingway.
Don't worry.
He'll get over it.
?
[Continues]
Mack, how you doin', my man?
Listen, I want you to meet Ricardo.
Ricardo Cooper here.
He's in.
[Tubbs] Mack, my man.
Evans says you can move weight.
Much as you've got.
That's good.
See, Mr. Cooper, I'm gonna turn the substance market on its ear.
Yeah?
How's that?
American ingenuity, pal.
That's right.
Rock or flake.
Absolutely pure.
Hundred percent synthetic cocaine.
Couldn't grow it any better.
- Guaranteed.
- You got weight on this?
Couple of weeks, you can get all you want.
Say "cheese," baby.
Cheese.
What's happening, Izzy, my man?
What's this Batman suit you got on?
Don't touch the threads, man.
What'd you say?
Don't touch the threads, man.
This is mine.
Hey, who's the whale over there?
Ecuadorean genius.
Flown in by your own boss, Mr. Mack.
Really?
Yeah.
He's a magical chemist of very exciting substances.
Yeah, I'm changin' my social status, man.
I conglomerate now only with intellectuals.
Knowledge is power.
And the power base, according to Iacocca, is based on loyalty.
Izzy, I don't wanna hear it.
You hear me?
I don't wanna hear it!
All right?
Bye-byel
Come on, party!
[Deejay On P.A.] Ricardo Tubbsl
He's made.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are blessed tonight... with the presence of one of N. Y.P.D. 's finestl
Not now.
We'll take care of this cop later.
[Crockett] It's unbelievable.
Six months of undercover work... to a bunch of mouth-breathin'ex-bikers, only to get blown out of the water by a million-to-one shot.
It happens.
It happens that he almost got shot.
Where does he fit in?
Clarence Batisse?
He was a New York cop, and he was my partner.
Is he involved with Mack's gang?
I doubt it.
He was a good cop.
Also a good man.
So what happened?
He got dismissed from the force.
It was a bad shoot.
Was it?
It was questionable.
[Sighs]
Clarence shot a bookie during a numbers bust.
I.A.D. Investigation hinged upon my testimony.
Clarence said that the guy had a gun.
Since I was the only other cop on the scene—
I never saw a gun.
We need to know if he's involved.
What else do we have on Mack?
Nada.
D.E.A.'s lab is gonna test this today.
But if Mack's genius has synthesized cocaine, we got a problem with no solution.
Might wanna check with our pal Izzy.
He was out hustling' last night.
Some fat guy and two of Mack's goons.
The guy with Izzy— That was Mack's chemist.
The fat guy?
That's him.
See what he's got.
I want this one fast, gentlemen.
?
[Rock On Radio, Faint]
[Dogs Barking]
[Izzy] Doggyl Dogs, get downl Come on in.
Come on in.
I'll put the dogs in the bar.
They love it in there.
Whoo, Izzy!
You gotta be breakin' half a dozen ordinances in here.
[Spanish] Let's go.
Hey, man, it's a temporary situation.
Yeah, yeah, we know.
Your uncle's dogs, misunderstanding with the track.
Please, spare me the details.
You know, these dogs have completely changed my lifestyle, man.
They keep me up all night.
I can't get any sleep.
They've learned how to turn on the video equipment.
[Gunfire On TV]
Hey, keep your paws off the video equipment, Fidel, Canseco!
I know who you are.
[TVShuts Off]
If I could just teach them how to clean up after themselves.
I wonder who's gonna clean up after Mack when his boys splatter you all over the highway... for gettin' his cocaine chemist drunk.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is a completely legitimatized escort service, man.
I have, uh, contracted with these gentlemen... to, uh, help their boy wonder, who is a serious social paralytic.
You see, his "pre-exhibition" with sex... has caused him to have a block, and he can't do his work properly.
Well, what else does this boy wonder do?
Eat.
A lot, man.
He's up to 275 already, man.
He completely devours my business expenses.
Izzy.
However—
However, as a man of commerce... who is imbued with the industrialist spirit,
I am not given to pry into the affairs of my clients.
Izzy, you work for us.
We own you.
So you're gonna tell us everything, right?
That's right, man.
Like a double agent.
Alec Leamas, huh?
Hey, listen, maybe you can do a favor for me, you know?
Talk to my parole officer, you know?
You know, explain to her that, uh, you know,
I haven't returned her phone calls because I'm out there in the cold, you know?
Don't push it, amigo.
You're about this close from goin' in as an accessory to manufacturing narcotics.
- Okay?
- Say no more.
Say no more.
I understand completely.
Thanks—Thanks for coming by and explaining that to me.
I feel terrible about it now.
I just—
I'll take care of everything, man.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Hello.
Hi.
I'm Ricardo Tubbs.
I'm a friend of Clarence's.
He's been expecting you.
Come in.
Thanks.
Ain't life a cabaret?
Eight years.
Bangl
There you were.
You almost got me killed last night.
What was that, retribution?
You don't think I had that right?
No, I don't.
I never asked you for much, man.
Just enough to save my career, my family.
You didn't think I wanted them to find that gun?
Oh, yeah.
Would have made it a lot easier on you.
Well, the guy was a bookie.
You were into him for two grand.
- I didn't know he held that note, man!
- Well, what was I supposed to do about it?
What I would have done— stand up for your partner.
I did not see a gun, Clarence.
That's the difference between you and me.
I would have seen whatever you told me you saw.
Come on.
Let's go outside.
[Sighs] You know what it was, Rico?
My friends stopped calling'.
My wife's friends stopped calling'.
Even the kids got it at school.
Finally, I just wanted to eat my gun.
It's no wonder they left me.
Two years later, Emeretta killed herself.
I'm sorry.
Right.
Court gave custody of my kids to her mother.
Said I wasn't fit.
So now I got a new career.
Five days a week, I play the hits.
Not bad.
The guy you're workin' for— He's the wrong guy, my friend.
Who, Mack?
Yeah.
I just spin the platters for him.
You're a cop.
You got cop's eyes.
You can't not just see things, man.
I choose not to see.
It's called survival.
Don't play me on this, man.
Don't accuse me, man.
You've already done that once.
Can this guy move weight?
Same guy that brought the cop.
The guy's a nickel-dime ounce dealer.
So why are we dealing with him?
Just doing a little test marketing.
Hey, man.
Mr. Evans.
Keepin' a man with all these dead presidents waiting.
Hey, pleasure before business.
She is a beautiful lady.
What is she, four keys at 28 per?
Twelve a pound, Mr. Evans.
You see, we're Americans.
We don't believe in the metric system.
Mm-hmm.
Twelve.
Twelve's good.
Keep holding prices like that, my man, and I'll be back in town, assuming' that stuff's as good as you say it is.
You wanna take a ride?
Yeah, I think I might.
See, the dean don't need no test.
I'll just take a little taste of the lady.
I'm sure she won't mind.
Crack it up.
Oh, man!
Oh!
Ohl
What's in this stuff, man?
Oh, Godl
God, help mel
What the hell?
Potency is high.
Yeah.
He pumping'?
Probably a variation in the pH.
[Typing]
[Printer Whirring]
[Whistles]
Left-handed isomer.
Stuff's potent.
Yeah, we know.
Crockett watched a guy bounce off the floor with it.
This mixer they've got is good.
He's closer than anyone I've seen to synthesizing the molecule.
I think they guinea-pigged your buyer.
He's got an ecgonine-type compound here a hundred times more potent than cocaine.
All he's gotta do is clean up the analog and cut the hell out of the potency.
If he can do it cost-effectively, we're in big trouble.
Well, how much more trouble can we be in?
It'll be legal.
Tucker said it's as close as she's seen an underground guy get.
If this blimp's found a way to cut overhead on synthetic production, he'll be able to undercut the entire market, which will kick off one hell of a drug war.
We'll be pickin'up bodies for weeks.
[Speaking Spanish]
[Continues]
Señor Sangres says that he hears that you got yourself one genius chemist, and also that he can supply distribution... to a very large segment of the Hispanic community that you can't... and that you can both maximize your profits... by becoming partners.
[Spanish]
Tell him I'm not interested in partners.
Sí, partner.
[Spanish]
Especially partners that can't speak English.
[Spanish]
Um— Señor Mack, I—
[Spits] Tell him.
Uh—
[Spanish]
[Continues In Spanish]
So what did he say?
Uh—
Just some kind of meaningless comment about certain— certain female persons... in your family.
He is a wise guy.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
I need some petty cash to get some new tapes.
Tiny, give him 500.
You got it.
By the way, thanks for the tip the other night.
No problem.
Tell Sangres he can take away Mack's chemist tonight.
11:00 sharp at the club.
?
[Rock]
?
[Man Singing]
She likes you, man.
She's in love with you.
Huh?
She's singeing the atmospherics.
Huh?
Am I right?
Huh?
Hey, she understands you, man.
She understands.
She understands the pressures that you are under.
Invite her to dinner, man.
Yes, throw kisses.
Throw kisses.
More kisses.
Invite her to dinner.
She'll go.
She'll go.
Hey— Iz, my man.
You and the chemist wanna party at the beach?
Lead the way, amigo.
[Spanish]
[Yells]
[Screaming, Shouting]
Get down!
Get down!
D.A. Wants us to shut down.
Pull Mack off the street.
Short-circuit a probable drug war.
They'd just be out in a day.
We'd be back to square one with no shot at the missing chemist.
No answer.
What's the word on Sangres's gang?
I'm beginning to wonder if that's who we're interested in.
Meaning?
Meaning our friend Clarence isn't at home, and I'm wondering how he, his girlfriend and Izzy... were able to waltz out of a 300-round-per-minute firefight.
For that, you got him tried and convicted?
No, sir.
But I'm also not gonna bend over backwards with misplaced guilt... tryin' to protect him either.
He was my partner, Sonny.
If it were me, how straight would you be standing?
This came in from New York.
Ever read it?
My requests were turned down.
This is off the record.
Lieutenant.
I gotta go to New York.
It's wrong.
You got 24 hours.
I don't know you.
I popped you eight years back in a numbers bust.
Maybe.
You made some statements to I.A.D.
Your partner?
He resigned.
So that's the big deal?
Look, in the report, you made some statements.
You said that you hid after your partner went down.
You were afraid that the cop might waste you too.
So?
As I recall, you came out from behind that vent pretty sure of yourself.
[Sighs] You carry any weight on my stay?
I'm not gonna lie to you, Lucas.
I know you're in here on some unrelated charges, but I got some favors owed me.
I might be able to help.
Yeah.
So how about it?
Your buddy have a gun?
He had a piece.
I hid it in the air-conditioning vent.
I knew I'd be out in a day.
The bust was bogus.
Why?
A $400 nickel-plated mag?
You think I'm gonna leave it for some stiff?
Maybe a bonus for some cop?
What kind of treatment is this, man?
You never heard of the Geneva Conventions?
[Spanish]
First, you kidnap me.
I agree only with the criminal theatricalization.
But this goes against my non-felonious instinctuals.
Chill out, Izzy.
You're gettin' on my nerves.
Speaking strictly, man, as an impersonal observer—
And you know I have no memory of anything that has happened here... if, uh, certain motorcycle types were to ask me.
But I gotta tell ya, man, you're making a big mistake.
[TV, Indistinct]
This sack of suet been workin'?
This computer rental's costing me a fortune, man, not to mention the rest of this garbage he says he needs.
He's taking a break, man.
He says he's real close.
[Speaking Spanish]
Listen, man, I gotta get some sleep.
I've been up for two days.
You'll get some sleep when you earn it.
Hey, I am earning it, man!
Hey, our arrangement was for me to keep the— [Spanish]
Keep the client satisfied, and that's exactly what I'm doing.
But this is different, man.
Oh, no.
I wanna renegotiate my contract with you.
What do you mean, renegotiate?
This is a class "A" felony here, man—
[Muttering In Spanish]
Okay, so you're in the john and you hear it hit the fan.
What is this?
You want me to draw you a damn picture?
We've been through this twice already.
Look, Burnett, don't crack wise with me.
Everybody involved goes six feet down behind this.
This ain't 1969, pal.
[Phone Ringing]
Yeah?
Señor Mack?
Hey, this is Izzy.
Listen, I'm here with the big guy, man.
We got some problems.
We've been kidnapped by Sangres.
Is Luna all right?
Yeah, yeah.
He's fine.
He's fine.
He's fine, Mack, for right now.
Well, what does the wetback want?
What does he want?
Well, you know, I really don't feel like being the, uh, conveyance of these ludicrous demands.
[Shouting]
[Shouting Continues]
How ludicrous?
Hey, man, he wants a million.
Dollars.
You tell him he's crazy.
No, no, no.
You tell him he's dead.
Uh, Señor Mack, uh— [Continues In Spanish]
[Shouting In Spanish]
Señor Sangres says that every six hours, he's going to hit Señor Luna over the head with a heavy object until— until you deliver the entire amount... in $100 bills.
Yeah, well, how do I know he hasn't done that already?
How do I even know he's alive?
You need some insurances?
Like a picture or something?
Yeah.
I want a picture of you with the fat freak with today's headline.
Now, you got that?
Sí.
Yes, he agrees.
Uh, he'll be back in touch with you tonight.
Hey, listen, man, don't trust this guy, man.
Don't trust— [Dial Tone]
Hello?
Hello?
[Handset Slams In Cradle]
[Crockett] No, Sangres is smart.
He's not gonna hurt Luna.
You think he already has the formula?
I don't know.
Somethin's wrong.
Why just a million?
Sangres knows how much that formula could be worth.
And if Luna's already come up with it,
Sangres would probably just croak him so he'd have an exclusive on it.
You don't think Sangres has him.
I don't know.
I got a feeling somethin's not right.
You wanna come in?
No, it's not me.
The cover's solid.
What happens next?
Wait for the Cubans to call.
I better get back.
I'm gonna be under for the remainder.
[Spanish]
What's he sayin'?
He says he's got 100% pure synthetic cocaine.
And now he wants to sample the goods, and he wants me to join him.
I'm going to have to fake this, man.
Drugs tend to upset my psychiatrical gyroscopics.
[Spanish]
Pachanga, man.
[Coughing]
Luna?
Luna?
[Spanish]
We got problems.
You are aware, I'm sure, of the laws in the State of Florida?
Specifically, man, chapter 782.04, which states that any person killed... while perpetrating a crime such as arson, kidnapping, burglary, sexual assault or aircraft piracy... shall be found guilty—
- Come on.
Hey, man!
- Hold him up, man.
Can be found of murder in the second degree, which is punishable by imprisonment in jail... for a term of years no exceeding life.
Sure, man, if you get caught.
Hey, come on, man.
You got enough, man.
No— Come here, man!
[Grunts]
That's it, man.
That's enough.
Hey, man, you're not being too intellectual about this.
He's not gonna buy this— this—
Say, these— these pictures aren't too bad, you know?
This one's no good here, man.
Look at my hair.
Get rid of it.
No, that's—
Wait—
Here's the ticket.
Here's our meal ticket, man.
That's the one.
Melody, I gotta talk to Clarence.
I don't think we have much more to say to each other.
Where's Clarence?
Gone out.
So when's he coming back?
He's not gonna talk to you!
I don't think you understand.
I found out some valuable information that I think he needs to know.
And if he's not here, I'm gonna tell you.
Rico.
Hey, Clarence.
I was just gonna call you in the morning.
You must've talked to Melody.
Yeah, I, uh—
I haven't been exactly true-blue with you lately.
What are you talkin' about?
I helped, uh, Sangres snatch Luna, Mack's chemist.
- Oh, no.
- Man, I needed the money.
But Sangres is in over his head, man.
He'll give Luna back.
He's freaked.
He asked me what to do.
I said maybe you'd cut a deal with him.
I mean, I figured your people didn't want another gang war.
So, uh, he's willin' to set up Mack, and he wants to meet with you.
One-on-one, just the two of you.
Sounds like a conversation I should have.
I want immunity.
The Witness Protection gig, you know?
I'll talk to the D.A. It'll fly.
All right.
So when do I meet him?
On the waterfront at the old marina, tomorrow at 6:00 a.m.
[Grunts]
[Whimpers]
Got the way to go, man.
[Phone Rings]
Hello?
Burnett?
Hang on.
For you.
Hello?
Sonny?
It's me.
Can you talk?
Yeah, sort of.
The chemist is dead, man.
He took a hit on some synthetic cocaine.
He mixed up the batch hisself.
I'm not going down on a 782 for this, man.
I had nothing to do with it.
This is a Clarence Batisse special.
Okay.
Thanks.
My answering service.
New York called.
They're gonna reopen the case.
Well, it looks like it's not gonna do him any good.
Sonny was right.
Clarence is involved.
He's gonna need immunity.
He's settin' up a meet with Sangres.
Could you have made the case without him?
No.
We'd have had nothing.
When?
6:00 a.m. You need backup?
No, I think it would spook him.
"If you wanna continue doing business in Miami,
"you will deliver the ransom to Clarence Batisse...
"who will transport it to me at 6:00 a.m.
If he's followed, the deal's off."
Freakin' cop.
Can you believe this?
Maybe he's runnin' a scam.
Same shades the cop was wearing.
He's involved.
Where you meeting' him?
I'm supposed to go to a phone booth.
Yeah, right.
He'll run you all over town until he knows you're clean.
But you're gonna call us and let us know where you're meetin' him.
You wanna make 150 large free and clear?
- How?
- Whack the cop.
You want the job or not?
Now, don't even think of tempting yourself here, my friend.
You just show him the green and— [Spits]
Melody.
Melody, where are you?
I'm here.
We're home free.
A million dollars and sweet revenge all in one night.
Oh, Lord.
Mr. Mack, it's Clarence.
Mr. Mack, I'm meetin' Tubbs at 6:00 a.m. At the old marina.
6:00 a.m. All right.
Is this revenge on Ricardo Tubbs?
Let's see how good he is gettin' people to believe him.
Well, he's not gonna take a fall for this, is he?
What do you care?
I owe him, Melody.
You're damn right you do.
More than you know.
What are you talkin' about?
He came by to tell you he read that I.A.D. Report.
They had never let him see it.
Well, I hope he enjoyed it.
He went to New York and he talked to the other guy.
There was a gun.
He hid it in the alley.
He admitted it?
Copped to the whole thing.
Tubbs went to the chief of detectives.
He thinks maybe you can get reinstated with back pay and everything.
He's waiting for a call from New York.
Clarence, what have you done?
Nothin' that I can't fix.
Showtime, chowderhead.
You're doin' fine, Clarence.
Where's Sangres?
Rico, listen.
You gotta trust me, man.
This whole thing's a setup.
I'm supposed to take you out.
What the hell are you talkin' about?
When I get next to you, I'm gonna pull out my piece and you're gonna get in the car.
Batisse, freeze!
Don't do itl Miami Vicel
[Crockett] Batisse, drop it.
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
[Siren Wailing] All right, put 'em on the car.
Over here.
You know the routine.
He was gonna take you out, Rico.
Hey, he was tryin' to save me.
Where's Luna's body?
What?
Where's Luna's body?
In the warehouse.
I saw a way to get the money and pay back.
I hated you so much.
And then after Melody told me what you'd done,
I realized the problem wasn't with you, it was with me.
What made you do it?
The Clarence Batisse that I knew couldn't even conceive of kidnapping somebody.
The Clarence Batisse you knew died eight years ago.
I don't think so.
I think there's plenty more on the inside.
We won't need the cuffs.
This man was a police officer.
He'll ride with me.
[Bell Rings]
This is the most amazing resume I've ever seen.
I've been with some really good schools.
The best.
All of them.
All of the best.
One right after another.
And you've also been with the Lucky Erin Bar and Grill.
Pittsburgh.
Bartender.
And a disc jockey.
In Oklahoma.
I used to broadcast in sign language.
You've been all over the map.
I've got a lot of energy.
I'm sure you do have a lot of energy and a lot of new ideas.
I did, too, when...
But nobody's trying to change the world around here.
Just trying to help a few deaf kids get along a little better, that's all.
Everything else is razzle-dazzle.
Am I, uh... am I making myself clear?
Yes, I believe that you are.
[Buzzing]
Are we being punished?
Hi.
I'm James Leeds, and... my signing is rusty, so how many of you can read lips?
No one?
O.K. Class dismissed.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Just testing.
Sit down.
Lydia and Tony, good lip readers.
Would you mind closing your notebook?
Thank you.
Now, give me one good reason why we should learn to speak.
Tony.
To pick up hearing girls.
To pick up hearing girls.
O.K. Let's work on this.
All right.
Now...
here.
You.
O.K. Here are two beautiful hearing girls.
You two guys want to pick them up.
What is the first thing you want to say, Danny?
Are you rich?
Are you r-i-i-ch?
Say it.
Rich.
Good.
Lydia.
I'm very rich.
Good.
Tony.
Let's go somewhere and do it.
No, thank you.
Let's go somewhere and do it-t.
I would rather do it with her.
Cute.
How about you guys?
You want to join us?
They don't talk.
Fair enough.
O.K. Reasons to talk.
Right.
If your hands are occupied.
For example, some guy owes you money.
He comes by,
How will you tell him to give you your money?
You can't use your hands.
You've got to speak.
Give me my money, you bum.
Call me names, will you?
I don't have to stand here and take that.
You want to fight, huh?
O.K. Put up your feet and fight like a man.
See?
[Crash]
Take your pots... and your lousy food and shove them...
Doesn't mince words, does she?
Mr. Leeds.
Oh, Leeds!
Leeds!
Join us.
Sure.
O.K.
Sorry.
Good thing you're out of my classroom.
Sit down, James.
Mary Lee Ochs, Assistant Superintendent.
Orin Dennis, math and social studies.
James Leeds.
Leeds.
Hi.
Did I hear Miss Ochs say you were one of her students?
Yes.
I started here at 5.
Really?
Wow, that's great.
I'm impressed.
For still being here?
Not what I meant.
See you all later.
Bye.
Who is that?
That's Sarah.
Never mind her.
She's a pain in the ass.
But who is she?
What does she do?
She works here.
Orin, I've got an idea.
How about the kids making potholders for parents' day?
They don't sell.
We've got hundreds left from last year.
We do?
Oh.
We do?
Oh.
Sarah came here at 5, too.
We grew up together.
Is she a teacher, too?
She was one of our brightest students.
Would you give me some of the water?
Thank you.
Leeds, you're a genius.
You will work.

A drip.
[Very Loud] Oh!
What a drip!
No.
No.
No!
No!
That's not what I meant.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm James Leeds.
It's Sarah, isn't it?
Would you like to sit down?
Right here.
O.K. We'll both stand up.
Oh, I see.
Very good.
You got me there.
Could you look at me, please?
If you don't look at me, I can't...
So, um...
Dr. Franklin tells me that you've been here since you were 5.
Mm-hmm.
Um... when did you graduate?
And, uh, now... now...
now you work here?
Are you reading my lips?
I don't think that you are reading my lips.
Ohhh...
Gee, that was quick of me, wasn't it?
You could've told me.
Why?
I don't know.
How about common courtesy?
How about me getting out of here so you can mop the floor?
Man... you know, if you let me,
I bet I could teach you how to speak.
And you could teach me... but I don't want to mop the floor.
Gee, that was quick.
And you don't want to speak.
Brilliant.
Schmuck.
It's a damn shame.
Costly, too.
Resodding is damn costly.
No.
I'm talking about Sarah Norman.
Right.
Sarah.
Look at this, will you?
What a mess.
Has she ever tried speaking?
Sarah's not hard of hearing.
She's totally deaf.
Born that way.
That makes it tough.
The rain's lousing up the fields.
It's a shame that a bright woman is stuck here cleaning toilets.
Doesn't bother her.
Oh, no?
Look, hotshot, not everyone wants to be a star.
Sarah is content.
She had a rotten childhood.
She was diagnosed as retarded until she was 7.
We let her know how smart she was.
For what?
She's productive.
Pays taxes.
Oh, brother.
All right.
You want to try?
I'll talk to her.
Huh?
I'll talk to her.
Look at this.
Will you look at this?
Damn!
It's going to cost $2,000 or $3,000 at least.
Oh, brother.
S-S-Sat.
Sat.
All right.
[Bell Rings]
That's good.
You have to work on S's, though.
O.K.?
Go.
Out.
James, Sarah has agreed to give you an hour.
She's really looking forward to it.
You're really looking forward to it, aren't you?
What did I tell you?
Well, uh...
have fun, Jim... as usual.
Well, Sarah, uh... yeah.
I do mind, actually.
Fire laws and all that, but you go right ahead.
Listen... how would you like to fake out Franklin, make me look real good?
I'm sorry.
I didn't get that.
Uh... if...
I... don't... sign... faster... the hour will be over before I finish my opening speech.
No.
I'm all out of jokes.
Good.
I'm not funny.
Oh, yeah?
If you could hear, you'd think I was a scream.
You're deaf?
Well, I'll try to remember that.
I'll forget?
No, I won't.
Listen, um... why don't we get this thing started here?
Well, thank you for stopping by.
The pleasure was mine.
God.
My mama.
Your mama.
Great.
Go.
Glen, who's your favorite person?
Twisted Sister?
It's the name of the rock group.
Oh.
Oh.
Try saying that.
Twisted Sister.
Glen, it takes courage.
I know.
Just give me one sound.
One. "T."
"T."
Try.
"T."
Tweeh...
That's great.
Yeah.
Out of here.
Go.
Great.
Johnny?
Who's your favorite person?
Princess Di?
Benji?
No.
Terminator?
Uh...
[Bell Rings]
Hey.
Hey, you want to play stand up, sit down again?
Whoa, careful, you almost smiled.
Ah, that's a girl.
That's the Sarah Norman we all know and love.
If my jokes are terrible and my signing is boring, what are you doing here?
There's a whole empty beach.
Unbelievable.
I tried to call your mother.
Hey.
Hold it.
Wait.
Wait.
I can't...
I didn't even talk to her.
O.K.?
I mean, can we stop this?
I mean, why can't we...
I mean, why can't we just... why don't we... why don't we... go out and have some dinner tonight?
Huh?
Just give me a yes or a no.
Yes?
Good.
I think.
O.K. Um...
I will meet you behind, uh... the girls' dormitory, 8:00.
I will whisper your name.
Hey!
I know that sign.
That's the first sign I ever learned.
It's in Italian.
Can I suggest something?
Will you give me a break?
My Italian is worse than my signing.
The veal piccata is very good.
Look.
I'm sorry.
V-E-A-L P-I-C-C-A-T-A.
I mean, you see, by the time I finish, they may be out of it.
It's veal.
It's, uh... sauteed in lemon and butter.
What's veal?
Uh...
God.
What the hell is veal?
Um...
Good evening.
Something to drink this evening?
You want something to drink, Sarah?
Our house wine is very nice.
You want some wine?
Yeah.
It's O.K.
Uh, white wine.
We'll take a carafe, please.
He doesn't think you're stupid.
He thinks you're deaf.
No.
Only stupid hearing people think that deaf people are stupid.
Do you really like being a cleaning woman?
Why?
Yeah.
I mean, there are other jobs where a person can work alone in silence.
Not with toilet bowl cleaner?
You should have told me that was the attraction.
You are smart as hell, you know?
You want to dance?
Can you feel it?
through your nose!

That's your opinion.
That's fine.

Mrs. Norman?
I'm James Leeds.
I didn't call again... because I would've hung up again.
It's 60 miles here and back.
Please, just five minutes.
I just got home from work.
This is my time to relax.
Discussing Sarah is hardly relaxing.
Five minutes.
Well.
Well.
Uh...
let's see.
You haven't seen Sarah in eight years?
Let's get this straight.
Sarah doesn't want to see me.
Has she said why?
We don't communicate very well.
Did you ever learn to sign?
Some of the parents...
I'm really sick of you people coming here every few years asking the same questions, blaming me.
God.
No one's blaming you.
Of course they are.
They can't blame themselves.
So, it's all my fault.
Fine.
I don't give a damn anymore.
I really just came to ask one question.
What happened when Sarah tried to speak?
What happened?
She looked awful.
She sounded awful.
People made fun of her.
What do you think?
Who made fun of her?
Other kids.
Her sister's friends.
Then she stopped trying to talk.
She's very pretty, you know.
Her sister Ruth had a bunch of boys hanging around, and they started asking Sarah out when she came home on weekends.
It was wonderful for her.
The boys really liked her.
They treated her just like they treated Ruth... with respect.
If you didn't know there was a problem, you would've thought she's perfectly normal.
Hi.
It's true.
I'm early today.
No.
Don't go.
I wanted to talk to you, anyway.
No.
I want to hel... work with you.
I understand that you're scared.
I understand nothing.
Sarah!
Come back here.
Sarah.
Yelling at the back of a deaf person.
Very good, James.
He's been at all the best schools.
Why did you stop going home?
Did your sister's friends, those boys that you were going out with, did they have anything to do with it?
Yes.
I talked to your mother.
Please, let me help you, damn it!
How?
By showing you the joys of sex with a hearing man?
I think that's one language you don't speak.
Yeah, O.K. I'm so...
Come on.
I can take it.
You have more than enough communication skills.
I don't.
They never did?
O.K.
[Stamps Floor]
Hey!
Who is they?
Hearing boys?
They could never be bothered to learn my language.
I was always expected to learn to speak.
Well, I don't speak.
Sex was always something I could do as well as hearing girls.
Better!
At first, I let them have me because they wanted to.
Before long, the boys were lined up on a waiting list my sister kept for me.
No introduction, no talk.
Just went to a dark place and...
They didn't even take me out for a Coke first.
That's not what I wanted to know about you.
I thought I was such a big deal... coming on to the deaf girl, giving her a thrill.
No, Sarah.
All the time, you were laughing at me.
I was thinking, "poor little deaf virgin who spread her legs for every..."
You think that I'm threatened by that?
You think that I give a good goddamn that you fucked every pimply-faced teenager?
I don't.
I don't give a shit!
Whoo.
Sarah, please listen to me.
I'm not going away.
I did the wrong thing.
I'm sorry.
I...
I don't know what to say.
Tell me what to say.
Sarah... you are the most mysterious, beautiful, angry person
I have ever met.
I am falling in lo...
Sarah...
Sarah...
I am falling... into the pool with you!
God!
What a fellow has to go through.

We've got to have you to the house.
I'd like that.
I warn you, though...
I'm a poker player.
So I've heard.
Are you a card player?
No, not really.
Tic-tac-toe's my game.
So much the better, huh?
Well...
Thanks for coming in, Jim.
We're really happy to have you with us.
Thank you.

Yeah.

Daphne.
Hmm?
You're leading again.
Sorry.
I got a funny sensation in my toes... like someone was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Let's throw another log on the fire.
[Tango Music Plays]
Ole!
[Jim] Ow!
Ow, ow, ow.
You are... the... nicest person...
I've... ever met.
Who, me?
I'm the nicest person you've ever met?
That's the craziest thing that I ever heard.
You thought after what you told me... that you'd never see me again?
Here I am.
Yeah, I was in love, but... she broke my heart.
Oh.
Yeah, I know.
Please don't break my heart.
Did anyone ever break yours?
You don't hurt from other people?
You never hurt from other people?
That's not true.
Sarah, I know people have hurt you.
I know.
Suppose you admitted that you hurt.
I'd... shrivel up and...
I'll take care of you, Sarah.
I'll take care of you.
What do you mean, that was my foul?
You moved into me.
You want to call me an asshole, say it.
No.
Say it out loud.
Watch my lips.
Asshole.
Ah-hole.
Ass... hole.
Ass-hole.
Great!
Asshole.
Good.
It was still your foul.
Asshole!
Did you know that waves strike the average beach about 750,000 times a day?
Wha...
That's true.
I just made it up.
You do?
What do waves sound like?
Whoo.
That is what they sound like.
How did you get to be so brilliant and beautiful?
And pigheaded.
You're the most stubborn person.
Yeah, you.
You're not stubborn?
O.K.
Hi, beautiful.
What am I saying?
Wait.
Sarah, that was a joke.
It wasn't funny.
O.K., I won't do it again.
I promise.
Sarah...
I promise.
Come on!
Mr. Harrison!
How are you?
Couldn't be better, Curtis.
Ah-ha.
Jim Harrison.
He donated the chemistry lab.
Your boy Glen is coming along.
He's a fine lad.
Has he changed that idiotic haircut?
No.
I like to give the kids a lot of leeway.
Asshole!
Shit For Brains!
Look at those shingles.
Guess they'll all have to be replaced.
[Applause]
Thank you, Mr. Jones' class for your informative demonstration of the importance of the four food groups.
has a special treat for us.

Where did they leave it?
In here.
Where in here?
What did they do?
Just a cut, huh?
It's five stitches, huh?
You stupid son of...
She could have seriously hurt herself... in front of a parent.
It's going to stop now.
What?
I don't know what made her upset.
You've got no right to mess her up!
She is not messed up.
I'm not discussing this.
Nobody's going to fuck with one of my students.
She's no student!
She's a 25-year-old woman!
Nobody's going to fuck with one of my employees.
It's going to stop!
She's quitting her job!
She's what?
She's quitting.
She's moving in with me!
Oh.
Oh, I see.
She's going to be your maid now, huh?
Jesus Christ, Franklin.
James, James...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That wasn't fair.
That wasn't fair to Sarah, either.
I've seen this kind of thing before.
It just doesn't work!
This isn't this kind of thing.
This is us.
This is Sarah and me.
I love her!
Sure, the kids made me happy.
Is that against the law?
I don't hate you for not learning how to speak.
Sarah...
Sarah, I...
Iove you.
I need you.
Where are your suitcases?
Aha!
[Stamps On Floor]
It's your suitcase.
You are moving in with me today.
Here.
I'm packing your clothes.
You'll need some clothes.
Now, it's your turn.
Screw your job.
I got mine.
You can do whatever you want.
Sarah... what do you want?
Me.
You got me.
What else?
Children.
You want... deaf children?
What do you want me to say, that I want deaf children?
No, I don't.
But if they were, that would be fine.
Ah.
Could you get me some more, too?
I don't think she heard me.
Mr. Leeds!
I don't think you're an asshole anymore.
No?
No.
I think you're a... dick-brain.
Dick-brain?
That's fantastic.
I got it right away.
Yeah, Dick-brain.
Really excellent.
Good work.
Choo choo choo choo.
Machine, freeze.
Favorite candy, Tony.
Chunky.
Good.
Go.
Freeze.
Favorite animal, Lydia.
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Fine actor, fine actor.
Go!
Freeze.
Favorite football player...
Ooh.
Johnny.
Thank you, Johnny.
And favorite football hero, Cheryl.
Billy "White Shoes" Johnson.
Great choice.
Go.
You ready?
No, Franklin will not expect you to speak.
My God, you look so gorgeous.
[Doorbell Rings]
I'll get it.
This is great.
I cannot believe this...
James.
And Sarah!
Oh, come in.
Come in, please.
Oh, Martha, Sarah's here, too.
You've taught her to play poker?
Not me.
She learned it out of a book.
Well, about that time.
Sarah knows how to play poker?
It's good to see you again.
You look... mmm!
Here.
Sit next to me.
No, no, no.
No couples together.
Let's break it up.
Come on, break it up.
Sarah... no cheating.
Don't start, Curtis.
I've seen deaf people cheat like bandits.
Come on.
Oh, yes.
Those little signs that no one will see.
Very funny, Franklin.
Don't pay attention to him.
With Jim, of course.
Together, you can clean up.
Jim won't cheat.
He's not deaf.
That's very good.
Very good, Sarah.
Very good.
High card deals.
9. 10.
You're high.
You deal.
Nickel, dime, and quarter.
All of them?
Yes.
Ante up, everybody.
Out of a book, huh?
Five card draw.
One-eyed jacks wild.
One-eyed jacks wild?
One-eyed jacks.
O.K.
You're doing great with her, Jim.
Yeah, what a change.
Pretty impressive, James.
What about the poor guys that lost?
Want these here or in the kitchen?
No, I'll clean up.
It's no bother.
It's fine.
I can't believe how well she played.
There goes my mad money.
Great.
James... where can I get a copy of that book?
You are smart.
She bluffed me.
I folded with three of a kind.
Did you teach her that?
Quite a coup, James.
A lesson for us all.
Oh, God.
God, I can't ever get close enough.
Say my name.
Just once, say my name.
I'm sorry.
I need it...
I'm...
I know I promised.
I'm sorry.
I forgot.
I...
I'm not lying.
I don't want you to speak.
It just came out.
Please, it just...
I'm sorry.
Hike!
No.
No.
I don't care!
They killed my brother.
Don't kill him!
Don't shoot!
They'll shoot you, too!
Get out of my way!
Shoot please!
Do it for me!
[Gunshots]
Can we have some soda?
Yes.
[Telephone Rings]
The phone is ringing.
What?
The phone is ringing.
What phone?
The phone you can't hear because it's so noisy.
Turn that damn thing down.
Good grief.
What am I saying?
[Ring]
The phone is ringing.
The TV is blasting.
[Teakettle Whistles]
The kettle...
If someone would just fire a bazooka through the window.
[Gunshots]
Can you hold on?
That would be great.
Water's boiling.
Hello.
What?
Ask him to hang on for a second.
[Tires Squealing]
It's for you.
It's one of the dorm counselors.
He's translating a call from a deaf man.
It's Orin.
Lydia, Danny!
For god's sake...
It's over.
Bye.
Thank God for small favors.
O.K. You still there?
Great.
You both ready?
We're both ready.
This is Sarah speaking to Orin.
Hi.
Why are you calling?
I'm having a small dinner party.
I want you to come, please.
How about me, please?
Don't translate that to Orin.
Please.
No, I'm not saying please.
Wait a minute.
That was Orin saying please.
Look, it's my fault.
I probably sounded like myself instead of like the dorm counselor sounding like Orin.
He wants you to come to a party for...
Marian Loesser.
Please.
Great.
Um...
She is dying to see you.
Bring James!
Friday at 7:00.
O.K. Fine.
We'll be there.
Yeah.
Thank you.
My God.
Either I just went deaf, or it is suddenly quiet in here.
I do not make everything into a joke.
I possibly obscure...
How the hell would you sign "obscure"?
Obscure.
I'm going to rest my hands and my eyes and listen to 20 minutes of Bach.
You know...
I haven't turned on my hi-fi since you...
Hold it.
That sounds like... like I'm blaming you for me not listening to music.
Thank you.
I will.
I'll rest my hands... and listen to something beautiful.
[Bach Plays]
I can't enjoy it.
I can't, because you can't.
[Bach Plays]
Show you the music?
Let's see...
I can't.
Don't be sad for you.
All right, I won't.
What should you wear to the party?
I don't know.
Have I ever heard of who?
Oh, Marian.
She's the lady the party's for?
No.
Should I have?
She's very famous in the deaf community.
Nice catch.
She has two Ph.D. s, and she doesn't speak.
Take a look at these.
Hungry?
I can't communicate with someone when my mind is busy amusing itself.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
What do you hear?
I mean, is it just silence?
No one has ever gotten in there to find out?
Will you ever let me in?
She's something, isn't she?
Is she a lawyer or something?
Uh-uh.
An economist in Washington.
A real math whiz.
How thrilling.
Yeah.
It is.
I just feel like everyone is talking in some far northern Hungarian dialect over there.
I know the feeling.
Just because I wanted to leave, doesn't mean you wanted to leave.
All right.
Sarah, what the hell is wrong with you tonight?
I'll wait.
Sure.
Marian's great.
So what?
She has everything.
Education.
Great job.
Money.
Well, I'll tell you one thing that she has not got.
Me.
Oh, we're not talking about me for once.
That's true.
Hey...
Let's crawl under the covers, sweetheart, and pretend we're in some... romantic, distant place.
We're not.
We're here.
Right.
O.K.
Let's deal with it.
What is making you so miserable?
Oh...
Let's go to sleep?
No.
You can't start a bonfire and then say night-night.
And you can't start a bonfire and then run away, either.
Oh, you can do anything you want?
Yeah, like what?
Nothing.
I can do nothing.
I'm equipped for nothing and trained for nothing.
You feel like an idiot.
I treat you like an idiot?
I pity you?
Wait a second.
And now you see Marian...
What about Marian?
Let you be you?
I don't?
I want you to be a deaf person so I can change you into a hearing person?
I don't want to help anybody.
I just want to change and control...
Good night.
No... you think that I want you to speak.
And you just want to be you?
Well, who the hell are you?
Right.
[Stamps Floor]
What?
God, you want to make love now?
Fuck you, lady.
Oh, that's what you want.
You understood that.
That didn't help much.
Oh, it helped you?
Great.
That's really wonderful.
Makes me happy.
What a night.
I think that helped.
Yeah?
What have you just decided?
No one's ever going to speak for you again?
Come on.
How are you going to manage?
Everyone's always told me who I am, and I let them.
"She wants, she thinks."
And most of the time they were wrong.
They had no idea what I said, wanted, thought.
And now they won't.
Well, that's all right.
I'll buy that.
No, I won't.
How could I?
Because I love you.
Love has nothing to do with it?
That's wonderful.
Then what the hell have we been doing?
Watch your hands?
It's hard to avoid them.
This sign... to connect... simple.
But it means so much more when I do this.
Now it means... to be joined in a relationship.
Separate, but one.
That's what I want.
But you think for me, think for Sarah.
As though there were no "I."
She will be with me, quit her job, learn how to play poker, leave Orin's party, learn how to speak.
That's all you, not me.
Until you let me be an "I,"
the way you are, you can never come inside my silence and know me.
And I won't let myself know you.
Until that time... we can't be like this... joined.
Well... that's all very moving.
But... how are you going to manage?
You can lock yourself back in your precious silent castle...
I heard.
I heard every word, goddamn it.
I translated for myself.
It went from your hands into my brain and out my mouth.
And you know what?
I think you're lying.
I don't think that you think being deaf is so goddamn wonderful.
I think that you're scared to death to try.
I think it's nothing but stupid pride that's keeping you from speaking right.
You want to be on your own.
You don't want to be pitied.
Then you learn to read my lips and use your mouth for something besides showing me you're better than hearing girls in bed.
Read my lips.
What am I saying?
What am...
You want to talk to me, then you learn my language.
Did you understand that?
You've probably been reading lips for years.
But that's the great control game, isn't it?
I'm the controller?
What a fucking joke.
Now, come on!
Speak to me!
Speak!
Speak to me!
Aah!
See my mouth?
Aah!
Hear my voice?
Aah!
I'm not afraid!
Hot chocolate.
Your favorite.
Have you... come... home... to stay?
Of course you can.
As long as you like.
You need a job, but there's nothing.
I'll...
I'll...
I'll help.
I... never helped.
Don't... hurt me now.
The last time, you... we... sent you away because...
I didn't know... how to... take care of you.
Your father... couldn't accept you.
He felt... he'd failed.
You're right.
I hated you... for... driving him away.
Please... forgive me.
[Telephone Rings]
[Ring]
Telephone.
What...
What should I say?
[Ring]
[Ring]
[Ring]
Hello.
No...
I'm sorry, James.
No, she's not.
All right.
I'll call you if I see her.
[Bach Plays]
Favorite books.
Good.
Do you have any favorite books, Glen?
Yeah.
Skull?
I'll put that on my summer reading list.
I have to see her.
I know she doesn't want to see me.
She's made that very clear.
But I have to see her.
She'll let you know when she wants to see you.
She's working now.
She's saving her money.
She wants to go to college.
That's fine.
That's wonderful.
Um...
I've looked all over, Mrs. Norman.
Please.
Spring cleaning.
How was your day?
Are you O.K.?
No.
You're not fine.
You're lonely.
[Music Box Plays]
He was here.
He misses you.
You don't know what to do.
I think maybe you do.

You've been angry since you were a little girl.
You didn't want to hurt again, so you used your anger... to push me away.
You're sorry.
I'm sorry... for hurting you.
But you learned from me.
You learned that you can hurt... and you won't shrivel up and blow away.
I don't want to be without you, either.
Do you think... that we could find a place... where we can meet... not in silence... and not in sound?
[Waves Crashing]
[Bell rings]
This is the most amazing resume I've ever seen.
I've been with some really good schools.
The best.
All of them.
All of the best.
One right after another.
And you've also been with the lucky Erin bar and grill.
Pittsburgh.
Bartender.
And a disc jockey.
In Oklahoma.
I used to broadcast in sign language.
You've been all over the map.
I've got a lot of energy.
I'm sure you do have a lot of energy and a lot of new ideas.
I did, too, when...
But nobody's trying to change the world around here.
Just trying to help a few deaf kids get along a little better, that's all.
Everything else is razzle-dazzle.
Am I, uh...
Am I making myself clear?
Yes, I believe that you are.
[Buzzing]
Are we being punished?
Hi.
I'm James Leeds, and...
My signing is rusty, so how many of you can read lips?
No one?
OK.
Class dismissed.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Just testing.
Sit down.
Lydia and Tony, good lip readers.
Would you mind closing your notebook?
Thank you.
Now, give me one good reason why we should learn to speak.
Tony.
To pick up hearing girls.
To pick up hearing girls.
OK.
Let's work on this.
All right.
Now...
Here.
You.
You.
OK.
Here are two beautiful hearing girls.
You two guys want to pick them up.
What is the first thing you want to say, Danny?
Are you rich?
Are you r-i-i-ch?
Say it.
Rich.
Good.
Lydia.
I'm very rich.
Good.
Tony.
Let's go somewhere and do it.
No, thank you.
Let's go somewhere and do it-t.
I would rather do it with her.
Cute.
How about you guys?
You want to join us?
They don't talk.
Fair enough.
OK.
Reasons to talk.
Right.
If your hands are occupied.
For example, some guy owes you money.
He comes by, but you just happen to be in a handstand.
How will you tell him to give you your money?
You can't use your hands.
You've got to speak.
Give me my money, you bum.
Call me names, will you?
I don't have to stand here and take that.
You want to fight, huh?
OK.
Put up your feet and fight like a man.
See?
[Crash]
Take your pots...
And your lousy food and shove them...
Doesn't mince words, does she?
Mr. Leeds.
Mr. Leeds.
Oh, Leeds!
Leeds!
Join us.
Sure.
OK.
Sorry.
Good thing you're out of my classroom.
Sit down, James.
Mary Lee Ochs, assistant superintendent.
Orin Dennis, math and social studies.
James Leeds.
Leeds.
Hi.
Did I hear miss Ochs say you were one of her students?
Yes.
I started here at 5.
Really?
Wow, that's great.
I'm impressed.
For still being here?
Not what I meant.
See you all later.
Bye.
Who is that?
That's Sarah.
Never mind her.
She's a pain in the ass.
But who is she?
What does she do?
She works here.
Orin, I've got an idea.
How about the kids making potholders for parents' day?
They don't sell.
We've got hundreds left from last year.
We do?
Oh.
Sarah came here at 5, too.
We grew up together.
Is she a teacher, too?
She was one of our brightest students.
Would you give me some of the water?
Thank you.
Leeds, you're a genius.
You will work.
[Classical music plays]
Ooh.
Yeah.
Mr. Bach.
Hear that...
Cat?
Ooh.
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang.

Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang.
One more time, faster.
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang.

That is great.
Brilliant.
My Lydia.
Come here, Lydia.
OK.
Put your hands on the speaker.
Come on.

[Very loud] Oh!
What a drip!
No.
No.
No!
No!
That's not what I meant.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm James Leeds.
It's Sarah, isn't it?
Would you like to sit down?
Right here.
OK.
We'll both stand up.
Oh, I see.
Very good.
You got me there.
Could you look at me, please?
If you don't look at me, I can't...
So, um...
Dr. Franklin tells me that you've been here since you were 5.
Mm-hmm.
Um...
When did you graduate?
And, uh, now... now... now you work here?
Are you reading my lips?
I don't think that you are reading my lips.
Ohhh...
Gee, that was quick of me, wasn't it?
You could've told me.
Why?
I don't know.
How about common courtesy?
How about me getting out of here so you can mop the floor?
Man...
You know, if you let me,
I bet I could teach you how to speak.
And you could teach me...
But I don't want to mop the floor.
Gee, that was quick.
And you don't want to speak.
Brilliant.
Schmuck.
It's a damn shame.
Costly, too.
Resodding is damn costly.
No.
I'm talking about Sarah Norman.
Right.
Sarah.
Look at this, will you?
What a mess.
Has she ever tried speaking?
Sarah's not hard of hearing.
She's totally deaf.
Born that way.
That makes it tough.
The rain's lousing up the fields.
It's a shame that a bright woman is stuck here cleaning toilets.
Doesn't bother her.
Oh, no?
Look, hotshot, not everyone wants to be a star.
Sarah is content.
She had a rotten childhood.
She was diagnosed as retarded until she was 7.
We let her know how smart she was.
For what?
She's productive.
Pays taxes.
Oh, brother.
All right.
You want to try?
I'll talk to her.
Huh?
I'll talk to her.
Look at this.
Will you look at this?
Damn!
It's going to cost $2,000 or $3,000 at least.
Oh, brother.
S-s-sat.
Sat.
All right.
[Bell rings]
That's good.
You have to work on s's, though.
OK.?
Go.
Out.
James, Sarah has agreed to give you an hour.
She's really looking forward to it.
You're really looking forward to it, aren't you?
What did I tell you?
Well, uh...
Have fun, Jim...
As usual.
Well, Sarah, uh...
Yeah.
I do mind, actually.
Fire laws and all that, but you go right ahead.
Listen...
How would you like to fake out Franklin, make me look real good?
I'm sorry.
I didn't get that.
Uh...
If...
I...
Don't...
Sign...
Faster...
The hour will be over before I finish my opening speech.
No.
I'm all out of jokes.
Good.
I'm not funny.
Oh, yeah?
If you could hear, you'd think I was a scream.
You're deaf?
Well, I'll try to remember that.
I'll forget?
No, I won't.
Listen, um...
Why don't we get this thing started here?
Well, thank you for stopping by.
The pleasure was mine.
God.
My mama.
Your mama.
Great.
Go.
Glen, who's your favorite person?
Twisted sister?
Twisted sister?
It's the name of the rock group.
Oh.
Oh.
Try saying that.
Twisted sister.
Glen, it takes courage.
I know.
Just give me one sound.
One. "T."
"T."
Try.
"T."
"T."
Tweeh...
That's great.
That's great.
Yeah.
Out of here.
Go.
Great.
Johnny?
Who's your favorite person?
Princess Di?
Benji?
No.
Terminator?
Uh...
[Bell rings]
Hey.
Hey, you want to play stand up, sit down again?
Whoa, careful, you almost smiled.
Ah, that's a girl.
That's the Sarah Norman we all know and love.
If my jokes are terrible and my signing is boring, what are you doing here?
There's a whole empty beach.
Unbelievable.
I tried to call your mother.
Hey.
Hold it.
Wait.
Wait.
I can't...
I didn't even talk to her.
OK.?
I mean, can we stop this?
I mean, why can't we...
I mean, why can't we just...
Why don't we...
Why don't we...
Go out and have some dinner tonight?
Huh?
Just give me a yes or a no.
Yes?
Good.
I think.
OK.
Um...
I will meet you behind, uh...
The girls' dormitory, 8:00.
I will whisper your name.
Hey!
I know that sign.
That's the first sign I ever learned.
It's in Italian.
Can I suggest something?
Will you give me a break?
My Italian is worse than my signing.
The veal piccata is very good.
Look.
I'm sorry.
V-e-a-l p-i-c-c-a-t-a.
I mean, you see, by the time I finish, they may be out of it.
It's veal.
It's, uh...
Sauteed in lemon and butter.
What's veal?
Uh...
God.
What the hell is veal?
Um...
Good evening.
Something to drink this evening?
You want something to drink, Sarah?
Our house wine is very nice.
You want some wine?
Yeah.
It's OK.
Uh, white wine.
We'll take a carafe, please.
He doesn't think you're stupid.
He thinks you're deaf.
No.
Only stupid hearing people think that deaf people are stupid.
Do you really like being a cleaning woman?
Why?
Yeah.
I mean, there are other jobs where a person can work alone in silence.
Not with toilet bowl cleaner?
You should have told me that was the attraction.
You are smart as hell, you know?
You want to dance?
Can you feel it?
Vibrations...
Through your nose!

You...
You should let me help you.
What is that?
Lydia does not talk like that.
Don't you want to be able to get along in the world?
No one wants my help?
That's your opinion.
That's fine.
You don't do anything you can't do well?
♫ I don't want to stop now ♫

♫ oh, oh

♫ I don't want to stop... ♫♫
well, I would like to walk with you.
It's...
My pleasure.
Mrs. Norman?
I'm James Leeds.
I didn't call again...
Because I would've hung up again.
It's 60 Miles here and back.
Please, just five minutes.
I just got home from work.
This is my time to relax.
Discussing Sarah is hardly relaxing.
Five minutes.
Well.
Well.
Uh...
Let's see.
You haven't seen Sarah in eight years?
Let's get this straight.
Sarah doesn't want to see me.
Has she said why?
We don't communicate very well.
Did you ever learn to sign?
Some of the parents...
I'm really sick of you people coming here every few years asking the same questions, blaming me.
God.
No one's blaming you.
Of course they are.
They can't blame themselves.
So, it's all my fault.
Fine.
I don't give a damn anymore.
I really just came to ask one question.
What happened when Sarah tried to speak?
What happened?
She looked awful.
She sounded awful.
People made fun of her.
What do you think?
Who made fun of her?
Other kids.
Her sister's friends.
Then she stopped trying to talk.
She's very pretty, you know.
Her sister Ruth had a bunch of boys hanging around, and they started asking Sarah out when she came home on weekends.
It was wonderful for her.
The boys really liked her.
They treated her just like they treated Ruth... with respect.
If you didn't know there was a problem, you would've thought she's perfectly normal.
Hi.
It's true.
I'm early today.
No.
Don't go.
I wanted to talk to you, anyway.
No.
I want to hel...
Work with you.
I understand that you're scared.
I understand nothing.
Sarah!
Come back here.
Sarah.
Yelling at the back of a deaf person.
Very good, James.
He's been at all the best schools.
Why did you stop going home?
Did your sister's friends, those boys that you were going out with, did they have anything to do with it?
Yes.
I talked to your mother.
Please, let me help you, damn it!
How?
By showing you the joys of sex with a hearing man?
I think that's one language you don't speak.
Yeah, OK.
I'm so...
Come on.
I can take it.
You have more than enough communication skills.
I don't.
They never did?
OK.
[Stamps floor]
Hey!
Who is they?
Hearing boys?
They could never be bothered to learn my language.
I was always expected to learn to speak.
Well, I don't speak.
Sex was always something I could do as well as hearing girls.
Better!
At first, I let them have me because they wanted to.
Before long, the boys were lined up on a waiting list my sister kept for me.
No introduction, no talk.
Just went to a dark place and...
They didn't even take me out for a coke first.
That's not what I wanted to know about you.
I thought I was such a big deal...
Coming on to the deaf girl, giving her a thrill.
No, Sarah.
All the time, you were laughing at me.
I was thinking, "poor little deaf virgin"
who spread her legs for every..."
you think that I'm threatened by that?
You think that I give a good goddamn that you fucked every pimply-faced teenager?
I don't.
I don't give a shit!
Whoo.
Sarah, please listen to me.
I'm not going away.
I did the wrong thing.
I'm sorry.
I...
I don't know what to say.
Tell me what to say.
Sarah...
You are the most mysterious, beautiful, angry person
I have ever met.
I am falling in lo...
Sarah...
Sarah...
I am falling...
Into the pool with you!
God!
What a fellow has to go through.
♫ my love will get ya
♫ like a boomerang, baby
♫ ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang
♫ ba-boom... ♫
how are things going, Jim?
Great.
Just great.
Good.
Good.
Glad to hear it.
We've got to have you to the house.
I'd like that.
I warn you, though...
I'm a poker player.
So I've heard.
Are you a card player?
No, not really.
Tic-tac-toe's my game.
So much the better, huh?
Well...
Thanks for coming in, Jim.
We're really happy to have you with us.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Oh, uh...
Your size?
Yeah.
Be careful, Jimbo.
Right.
Don't fight it.
Relax.
[Tango music plays]
Daphne.
Hmm?
You're leading again.
Sorry.
I got a funny sensation in my toes...
Like someone was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Let's throw another log on the fire.
[Tango music plays]
Ole!
[Jim] Ow!
Ow, ow, ow.
You are...
The...
Nicest person...
I've...
Ever met.
Who, me?
I'm the nicest person you've ever met?
That's the craziest thing that I ever heard.
You thought after what you told me...
That you'd never see me again?
Here I am.
Yeah, I was in love, but...
She broke my heart.
Oh.
Yeah, I know.
Please don't break my heart.
Did anyone ever break yours?
You don't hurt from other people?
You never hurt from other people?
That's not true.
Sarah, I know people have hurt you.
I know.
Suppose you admitted that you hurt.
I'd...
Shrivel up and...
I'll take care of you, Sarah.
I'll take care of you.
What do you mean, that was my foul?
You moved into me.
You want to call me an asshole, say it.
No.
Say it out loud.
Watch my lips.
Asshole.
Ah-hole.
Ass...
Hole.
Ass-hole.
Great!
Asshole.
Good.
It was still your foul.
Asshole!
Did you know that waves strike the average beach about 750,000 times a day?
Wha... that's true.
I just made it up.
You do?
What do waves sound like?
Whoo.
That is what they sound like.
How did you get to be so brilliant and beautiful?
And pigheaded.
You're the most stubborn person.
Yeah, you.
You're not stubborn?
OK.
Hi, beautiful.
What am I saying?
Wait.
Sarah, that was a joke.
It wasn't funny.
OK., I won't do it again.
I promise.
Sarah...
I promise.
Come on!
Mr. Harrison!
How are you?
Couldn't be better, Curtis.
Ah-ha.
Jim Harrison.
He donated the chemistry lab.
Your boy Glen is coming along.
He's a fine lad.
Has he changed that idiotic haircut?
No.
I like to give the kids a lot of leeway.
Asshole!
Shit for brains!
Look at those shingles.
Guess they'll all have to be replaced.
[Applause]
Thank you, Mr. Jones' class for your informative demonstration of the importance of the four food groups.
And now, Mr. Leeds' 11th grade speech and language class has a special treat for us.

where did they leave it?
In here.
Where in here?
What did they do?
Just a cut, huh?
It's five stitches, huh?
You stupid son of... she could have seriously hurt herself...
In front of a parent.
It's going to stop now.
What?
I don't know what made her upset.
You've got no right to mess her up!
She is not messed up.
I'm not discussing this.
Nobody's going to fuck with one of my students.
She's no student!
She's a 25-year-old woman!
Nobody's going to fuck with one of my employees.
It's going to stop!
She's quitting her job!
She's what?
She's quitting.
She's moving in with me!
Oh.
Oh, I see.
She's going to be your maid now, huh?
Jesus Christ, Franklin.
James, James...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That wasn't fair.
That wasn't fair to Sarah, either.
I've seen this kind of thing before.
It just doesn't work!
This isn't this kind of thing.
This is us.
This is Sarah and me.
I love her!
Sure, the kids made me happy.
Is that against the law?
I don't hate you for not learning how to speak.
Sarah...
Sarah, I...
Love you.
I need you.
Where are your suitcases?
Aha!
[Stamps on floor]
It's your suitcase.
You are moving in with me today.
Here.
I'm packing your clothes.
You'll need some clothes.
Now, it's your turn.
Screw your job.
I got mine.
You can do whatever you want.
Sarah...
What do you want?
Me.
You got me.
What else?
Children.
You want...
Deaf children?
What do you want me to say, that I want deaf children?
No, I don't.
But if they were, that would be fine.
Ah.
Could you get me some more, too?
I don't think she heard me.
Mr. Leeds!
I don't think you're an asshole anymore.
No?
No.
I think you're a...
Dick-brain.
Dick-brain?
That's fantastic.
I got it right away.
Yeah, dick-brain.
Really excellent.
Good work.
Choo Choo Choo Choo.
Choo Choo Choo Choo.
Machine, freeze.
Favorite candy, Tony.
Chunky.
Good.

Favorite animal, Lydia.
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Fine actor, fine actor.
Go!
Freeze.
Favorite football player...
Ooh.
Johnny.
Thank you, Johnny.
And favorite football hero, Cheryl.
Billy "White Shoes" Johnson.
Great choice.
Go.
You ready?
No, Franklin will not expect you to speak.
My God, you look so gorgeous.
[Doorbell rings]
I'll get it.
This is great.
I cannot believe this...
James.
And Sarah!
Oh, come in.
Come in, please.
Oh, Martha, Sarah's here, too.
You've taught her to play poker?
Not me.
She learned it out of a book.
Well, about that time.
Sarah knows how to play poker?
It's good to see you again.
You look...
Mmm!
Here.
Sit next to me.
No, no, no.
No couples together.
Let's break it up.
Come on, break it up.
Sarah...
No cheating.
Don't start, Curtis.
I've seen deaf people cheat like bandits.
Come on.
Oh, yes.
Those little signs that no one will see.
Very funny, Franklin.
Don't pay attention to him.
With Jim, of course.
Together, you can clean up.
Jim won't cheat.
He's not deaf.
That's very good.
Very good, Sarah.
Very good.
High card deals.
9. 10.
You're high.
You deal.
Nickel, dime, and quarter.
All of them?
Yes.
Ante up, everybody.
Out of a book, huh?
Five card draw.
One-eyed Jacks wild.
One-eyed Jacks wild?
One-eyed Jacks.
OK.
You're doing great with her, Jim.
Yeah, what a change.
Pretty impressive, James.
What about the poor guys that lost?
Want these here or in the kitchen?
No, I'll clean up.
It's no bother.
It's fine.
I can't believe how well she played.
There goes my mad money.
Great.
James...
Where can I get a copy of that book?
You are smart.
She bluffed me.
I folded with three of a kind.
Did you teach her that?
Quite a coup, James.
A lesson for us all.
Oh, God.
God, I can't ever get close enough.
Say my name.
Just once, say my name.
I'm sorry.
I need it...
I'm...
I know I promised.
I'm sorry.
I forgot.
I...
I'm not lying.
I don't want you to speak.
It just came out.
Please, it just...
I'm sorry.
Hike!
No.
No.
I don't care!
They killed my brother.
Don't kill him!
Don't shoot!
They'll shoot you, too!
Get out of my way!
Shoot please!
Do it for me!
[Gunshots]
Can we have some soda?
Yes.
[Telephone rings]
The phone is ringing.
What?
The phone is ringing.
What phone?
The phone you can't hear because it's so noisy.
Turn that damn thing down.
Good grief.
What am I saying?
[Ring]
The phone is ringing.
The TV is blasting.
[Teakettle whistles]
The kettle...
If someone would just fire a bazooka through the window.
[Gunshots]
Can you hold on?
That would be great.
Water's boiling.
Hello.
What?
Ask him to hang on for a second.
[Tires squealing]
It's for you.
It's one of the dorm counselors.
He's translating a call from a deaf man.
It's Orin.
Lydia, Danny!
For God's sake... it's over.
Bye.
Thank God for small favors.
OK.
You still there?
Great.
You both ready?
We're both ready.
This is Sarah speaking to Orin.
Hi.
Why are you calling?
I'm having a small dinner party.
I want you to come, please.
How about me, please?
Don't translate that to Orin.
Please.
No, I'm not saying please.
Wait a minute.
That was Orin saying please.
Look, it's my fault.
I probably sounded like myself instead of like the dorm counselor sounding like Orin.
He wants you to come to a party for...
Marian Loesser.
Please.
Great.
Um...
She is dying to see you.
Bring James!
Friday at 7:00.
OK.
Fine.
We'll be there.
Yeah.
Thank you.
My God.
Either I just went deaf, or it is suddenly quiet in here.
I do not make everything into a joke.
I possibly obscure...
How the hell would you sign "obscure"?
Obscure.
I'm going to rest my hands and my eyes and listen to 20 minutes of Bach.
You know...
I haven't turned on my hi-fi since you...
Hold it.
That sounds like...
Like I'm blaming you for me not listening to music.
Thank you.
I will.
I'll rest my hands...
And listen to something beautiful.
[Bach plays]
I can't enjoy it.
I can't, because you can't.
[Bach plays]
Show you the music?
Let's see...
I can't.
Don't be sad for you.
All right, I won't.
What should you wear to the party?
I don't know.
Have I ever heard of who?
Oh, Marian.
She's the lady the party's for?
No.
Should I have?
She's very famous in the deaf community.
Nice catch.
She has two PhDs, and she doesn't speak.
Take a look at these.
Hungry?
I can't communicate with someone when my mind is busy amusing itself.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
What do you hear?
I mean, is it just silence?
No one has ever gotten in there to find out?
Will you ever let me in?
She's something, isn't she?
Is she a lawyer or something?
Uh-uh.
An economist in Washington.
A real math whiz.
How thrilling.
Yeah.
It is.
I just feel like everyone is talking in some far northern Hungarian dialect over there.
I know the feeling.
Just because I wanted to leave, doesn't mean you wanted to leave.
All right.
Sarah, what the hell is wrong with you tonight?
I'll wait.
Sure.
Marian's great.
So what?
She has everything.
Education.
Great job.
Money.
Well, I'll tell you one thing that she has not got.
Me.
Oh, we're not talking about me for once.
That's true.
Hey...
Let's crawl under the covers, sweetheart, and pretend we're in some...
Romantic, distant place.
We're not.
We're here.
Right.
OK.
Let's deal with it.
What is making you so miserable?
Oh...
Let's go to sleep?
No.
You can't start a bonfire and then say night-night.
And you can't start a bonfire and then run away, either.
Oh, you can do anything you want?
Yeah, like what?
Nothing.
I can do nothing.
I'm equipped for nothing and trained for nothing.
You feel like an idiot.
I treat you like an idiot?
I pity you?
Wait a second.
And now you see Marian...
What about Marian?
Let you be you?
I don't?
I want you to be a deaf person so I can change you into a hearing person?
I don't want to help anybody.
I just want to change and control... good night.
No...
You think that I want you to speak.
And you just want to be you?
Well, who the hell are you?
Right.
[Stamps floor]
What?
God, you want to make love now?
Fuck you, lady.
Oh, that's what you want.
You understood that.
That didn't help much.
Oh, it helped you?
Great.
That's really wonderful.
Makes me happy.
What a night.
I think that helped.
Yeah?
What have you just decided?
No one's ever going to speak for you again?
Come on.
How are you going to manage?
Everyone's always told me who I am, and I let them.
"She wants, she thinks."
And most of the time they were wrong.
They had no idea what I said, wanted, thought.
And now they won't.
Well, that's all right.
I'll buy that.
No, I won't.
How could I?
Because I love you.
Love has nothing to do with it?
That's wonderful.
Then what the hell have we been doing?
Watch your hands?
It's hard to avoid them.
This sign...
To connect...
Simple.
But it means so much more when I do this.
Now it means...
To be joined in a relationship.
Separate, but one.
That's what I want.
But you think for me, think for Sarah.
As though there were no "I."
She will be with me, quit her job, learn how to play poker, leave Orin's party, learn how to speak.
That's all you, not me.
Until you let me be an "I,"
the way you are, you can never come inside my silence and know me.
And I won't let myself know you.
Until that time...
We can't be like this...
Joined.
Well...
That's all very moving.
But...
How are you going to manage?
You can lock yourself back in your precious silent castle...
I heard.
I heard every word, goddamn it.
I translated for myself.
It went from your hands into my brain and out my mouth.
And you know what?
I think you're lying.
I don't think that you think being deaf is so goddamn wonderful.
I think that you're scared to death to try.
I think it's nothing but stupid pride that's keeping you from speaking right.
You want to be on your own.
You don't want to be pitied.
Then you learn to read my lips and use your mouth for something besides showing me you're better than hearing girls in bed.
Read my lips.
What am I saying?
What am... you want to talk to me, then you learn my language.
Did you understand that?
You've probably been reading lips for years.
But that's the great control game, isn't it?
I'm the controller?
What a fucking joke.
Now, come on!
Speak to me!
Speak!
Speak to me!
Aah!
See my mouth?
Aah!
Hear my voice?
Aah!
Aah!
I'm not afraid!
Hot chocolate.
Your favorite.
Have you...
Come...
Home...
To stay?
Of course you can.
As long as you like.
You need a job, but there's nothing.
I'll...
I'll...
I'll help.
I...
Never helped.
Don't...
Hurt me now.
The last time, you...
We...
Sent you away because...
I didn't know...
How to...
Take care of you.
Your father...
Couldn't accept you.
He felt...
He'd failed.
You're right.
I hated you...
For...
Driving him away.
Please...
Forgive me.
[Telephone rings]
[Ring]
Telephone.
What...
What should I say?
[Ring]
[Ring]
[Ring]
Hello.
No...
I'm sorry, James.
No, she's not.
All right.
I'll call you if I see her.
[Bach plays]
Favorite books.
Favorite books.
Good.
Do you have any favorite books, Glen?
Yeah.
Skull?
I'll put that on my summer reading list.
I have to see her.
I know she doesn't want to see me.
She's made that very clear.
But I have to see her.
She'll let you know when she wants to see you.
She's working now.
She's saving her money.
She wants to go to college.
That's fine.
That's wonderful.
Um...
I've looked all over, Mrs. Norman.
Please.
Spring cleaning.
How was your day?
Are you OK.?
No.
You're not fine.
You're lonely.
[Music box plays]
He was here.
He misses you.
You don't know what to do.
I think maybe you do.

It was a shock, seeing you in there.
I didn't know what to do.
You were scared, too.
I hear that boomerang song.
♫ ooh, my love can't catch ya ♫♫
you've been angry since you were a little girl.
You didn't want to hurt again, so you used your anger...
To push me away.
You're sorry.
I'm sorry...
For hurting you.
But you learned from me.
You learned that you can hurt...
And you won't shrivel up and blow away.
I don't want to be without you, either.
Do you think...
That we could find a place...
Where we can meet...
Not in silence...
And not in sound?
[Waves crashing]
This is the most amazing resume I've ever seen.
I've been with some really good schools.
The best.
All of them.
All of the best.
One right after another.
And you've also been with the Lucky Erin Bar and Grill.
Pittsburgh.
Bartender.
And a disc jockey.
In Oklahoma.
I used to broadcast in sign language.
You've been all over the map.
I've got a lot of energy.
I'm sure you do have a lot of energy and a lot of new ideas.
I did, too, when...
But nobody's trying to change the world around here.
Just trying to help a few deaf kids get along a little better, that's all.
Everything else is razzle-dazzle.
Am I, uh... am I making myself clear?
Yes, I believe that you are.
Are we being punished?
Hi.
I'm James Leeds, and... my signing is rusty, so how many of you can read lips?
No one?
O.K. Class dismissed.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Just testing.
Sit down.
Lydia and Tony, good lip readers.
Would you mind closing your notebook?
Thank you.
Now, give me one good reason why we should learn to speak.
Tony.
To pick up hearing girls.
To pick up hearing girls.
O.K. Let's work on this.
All right.
Now...
here.
You.
You.
O.K. Here are two beautiful hearing girls.
You two guys want to pick them up.
What is the first thing you want to say, Danny?
Are you rich?
Are you r-i-i-ch?
Say it.
Rich.
Good.
Lydia.
I'm very rich.
Good.
Tony.
Let's go somewhere and do it.
No, thank you.
Let's go somewhere and do it- t.
I would rather do it with her.
Cute.
How about you guys?
You want to join us?
They don't talk.
Fair enough.
O.K. Reasons to talk.
Right.
If your hands are occupied.
For example, some guy owes you money.
He comes by, but you just happen to be in a handstand.
How will you tell him to give you your money?
You can't use your hands.
You've got to speak.
Give me my money, you bum.
Call me names, will you?
I don't have to stand here and take that.
You want to fight, huh?
O.K. Put up your feet and fight like a man.
See?
Take your pots... and your lousy food and shove them...
Doesn't mince words, does she?
Mr. Leeds.
Mr. Leeds.
Oh, Leeds!
Leeds!
Join us.
Sure.
O.K.
Sorry.
Good thing you're out of my classroom.
Sit down, James.
Mary Lee Ochs, Assistant Superintendent.
Orin Dennis, math and social studies.
James Leeds.
Leeds.
Hi.
Did I hear Miss Ochs say you were one of her students?
Yes.
I started here at 5.
Really?
Wow, that's great.
I'm impressed.
For still being here?
Not what I meant.
See you all later.
Bye.
Who is that?
That's Sarah.
Never mind her.
She's a pain in the ass.
But who is she?
What does she do?
She works here.
Orin, I've got an idea.
How about the kids making potholders for parents' day?
They don't sell.
We've got hundreds left from last year.
We do?
Oh.
We do?
Oh.
Sarah came here at 5, too.
We grew up together.
Is she a teacher, too?
She was one of our brightest students.
Would you give me some of the water?
Thank you.
Leeds, you're a genius.
You will work.
Ooh.
Yeah.
Mr. Bach.
Hear that... cat?
Ooh.
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang.
Again.
Faster.
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang.
One more time, faster.
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang.
Great.
Right.
That is great.
Brilliant.
My Lydia.
Come here, Lydia.
O.K. Put your hands on the speaker.
Come on.
Feel that?
Good.
Feel it.
Like a boomerang, baby
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang
Love can turn, turn around now
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang
Use your voice.
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang
Yeah.
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang
My heart can feel ya
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang
Close enough to steal ya
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang
Don't slip by, now
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang
Don't you know that I'll be comin'back to find ya
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang

Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang
Ooh, your love can turn around
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang
Ooh, my love is gonna catch ya
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang
It's comin'back to get ya
It's good that I met ya
Not givin'up
'Cause now I'm gonna try to get ya
You know a boy can change direction
Bringin'you love and protection
Baby, baby, baby
A drip.
Oh!
What a drip!
No.
No.
No!
No!
That's not what I meant.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm James Leeds.
It's Sarah, isn't it?
Would you like to sit down?
Right here.
O.K. We'll both stand up.
Oh, I see.
Very good.
You got me there.
Could you look at me, please?
If you don't look at me, I can't...
So, um...
Dr. Franklin tells me that you've been here since you were 5.
Mm-hmm.
Um... when did you graduate?
And, uh, now... now...
now you work here?
Are you reading my lips?
I don't think that you are reading my lips.
Ohhh...
Gee, that was quick of me, wasn't it?
You could've told me.
Why?
I don't know.
How about common courtesy?
How about me getting out of here so you can mop the floor?
Man... you know, if you let me,
I bet I could teach you how to speak.
And you could teach me... but I don't want to mop the floor.
Gee, that was quick.
And you don't want to speak.
Brilliant.
Schmuck.
It's a damn shame.
Costly, too.
Resodding is damn costly.
No.
I'm talking about Sarah Norman.
Right.
Sarah.
Look at this, will you?
What a mess.
Has she ever tried speaking?
Sarah's not hard of hearing.
She's totally deaf.
Born that way.
That makes it tough.
The rain's lousing up the fields.
It's a shame that a bright woman is stuck here cleaning toilets.
Doesn't bother her.
Oh, no?
Look, hotshot, not everyone wants to be a star.
Sarah is content.
She had a rotten childhood.
She was diagnosed as retarded until she was 7.
We let her know how smart she was.
For what?
She's productive.
Pays taxes.
Oh, brother.
All right.
You want to try?
I'll talk to her.
Huh?
I'll talk to her.
Look at this.
Will you look at this?
Damn!
It's going to cost $2,000 or $3,000 at least.
Oh, brother.
S-S-Sat.
Sat.
All right.
That's good.
You have to work on S's, though.
O.K.?
Go.
Out.
James, Sarah has agreed to give you an hour.
She's really looking forward to it.
You're really looking forward to it, aren't you?
What did I tell you?
Well, uh...
have fun, Jim... as usual.
Well, Sarah, uh... yeah.
I do mind, actually.
Fire laws and all that, but you go right ahead.
Listen... how would you like to fake out Franklin, make me look real good?
I'm sorry.
I didn't get that.
Uh... if...
I... don't... sign... faster... the hour will be over before I finish my opening speech.
No.
I'm all out of jokes.
Good.
I'm not funny.
Oh, yeah?
If you could hear, you'd think I was a scream.
You're deaf?
Well, I'll try to remember that.
I'll forget?
No, I won't.
Listen, um... why don't we get this thing started here?
Well, thank you for stopping by.
The pleasure was mine.
God.
My mama.
Your mama.
Great.
Go.
Glen, who's your favorite person?
Twisted Sister?
Twisted Sister?
It's the name of the rock group.
Oh.
Oh.
Try saying that.
Twisted Sister.
Glen, it takes courage.
I know.
Just give me one sound.
One. "T."
"T."
Try.
"T."
"T."
Tweeh...
That's great.
That's great.
Yeah.
Out of here.
Go.
Great.
Johnny?
Who's your favorite person?
Princess Di?
Benji?
No.
Terminator?
Uh...
Hey.
Hey, you want to play stand up, sit down again?
Whoa, careful, you almost smiled.
Ah, that's a girl.
That's the Sarah Norman we all know and love.
If my jokes are terrible and my signing is boring, what are you doing here?
There's a whole empty beach.
Unbelievable.
I tried to call your mother.
Hey.
Hold it.
Wait.
Wait.
I can't...
I didn't even talk to her.
O.K.?
I mean, can we stop this?
I mean, why can't we...
I mean, why can't we just... why don't we... why don't we... go out and have some dinner tonight?
Huh?
Just give me a yes or a no.
Yes?
Good.
I think.
O.K. Um...
I will meet you behind, uh... the girls' dormitory, 8:00.
I will whisper your name.
Hey!
I know that sign.
That's the first sign I ever learned.
It's in Italian.
Can I suggest something?
Will you give me a break?
My Italian is worse than my signing.
The veal piccata is very good.
Look.
I'm sorry.
V-E-A-L P-I-C-C-A-T-A.
I mean, you see, by the time I finish, they may be out of it.
It's veal.
It's, uh... sauteed in lemon and butter.
What's veal?
Uh...
God.
What the hell is veal?
Um...
Good evening.
Something to drink this evening?
You want something to drink, Sarah?
Our house wine is very nice.
You want some wine?
Yeah.
It's O.K.
Uh, white wine.
We'll take a carafe, please.
He doesn't think you're stupid.
He thinks you're deaf.
No.
Only stupid hearing people think that deaf people are stupid.
Do you really like being a cleaning woman?
Why?
Yeah.
I mean, there are other jobs where a person can work alone in silence.
Not with toilet bowl cleaner?
You should have told me that was the attraction.
You are smart as hell, you know?
You want to dance?
Can you feel it?
Vibrations... through your nose!
Ain't nobody worried
Ain't no smiling' faces
I'm not good at this.
And you are.
Great.
Lyin' to the races
Help me
Come on
Come on
Somebody help me, now
I'll take you there
Help me, y'all
I'll take you there
Help me, now
I'll take you there
Oh... ooh

Oh, oh
Mercy

I'll take you there
Oh

I'm callin'
Callin', callin' for mercy
I'll take you there
Mercy, mercy
I'll take you there
I've been
Loving you
Too long
To stop now
You were tied
And you want to be free
My love is going strong, girl
As you become a habit to me
Ooh, I'm loving you
A little too long...
I don't know why I became a speech teacher.
O.K.?
Let's dance.
It's too hard to dance and talk.
With you, my life...
Well, maybe I like to hear myself talk.
Hmm?
Has been so wonderful
Can't stop now...
I am a really good teacher, though.
You...
You should let me help you.
What is that?
Lydia does not talk like that.
Don't you want to be able to get along in the world?
No one wants my help?
That's your opinion.
That's fine.
You don't do anything you can't do well?
I don't want to stop now
Oh
Oh, oh
I've been loving you
A little too long
I don't want to stop...
Well, I would like to walk with you.
It's... my pleasure.
Mrs. Norman?
I'm James Leeds.
I didn't call again... because I would've hung up again.
It's 60 miles here and back.
Please, just five minutes.
I just got home from work.
This is my time to relax.
Discussing Sarah is hardly relaxing.
Five minutes.
Well.
Well.
Uh...
let's see.
You haven't seen Sarah in eight years?
Let's get this straight.
Sarah doesn't want to see me.
Has she said why?
We don't communicate very well.
Did you ever learn to sign?
Some of the parents...
I'm really sick of you people coming here every few years asking the same questions, blaming me.
God.
No one's blaming you.
Of course they are.
They can't blame themselves.
So, it's all my fault.
Fine.
I don't give a damn anymore.
I really just came to ask one question.
What happened when Sarah tried to speak?
What happened?
She looked awful.
She sounded awful.
People made fun of her.
What do you think?
Who made fun of her?
Other kids.
Her sister's friends.
Then she stopped trying to talk.
She's very pretty, you know.
Her sister Ruth had a bunch of boys hanging around, and they started asking Sarah out when she came home on weekends.
It was wonderful for her.
The boys really liked her.
They treated her just like they treated Ruth... with respect.
If you didn't know there was a problem, you would've thought she's perfectly normal.
Hi.
It's true.
I'm early today.
No.
Don't go.
I wanted to talk to you, anyway.
No.
I want to hel... work with you.
I understand that you're scared.
I understand nothing.
Sarah!
Come back here.
Sarah.
Yelling at the back of a deaf person.
Very good, James.
He's been at all the best schools.
Why did you stop going home?
Did your sister's friends, those boys that you were going out with, did they have anything to do with it?
Yes.
I talked to your mother.
Please, let me help you, damn it!
How?
By showing you the joys of sex with a hearing man?
I think that's one language you don't speak.
Yeah, O.K. I'm so...
Come on.
I can take it.
You have more than enough communication skills.
I don't.
They never did?
O.K.
Hey!
Who is they?
Hearing boys?
They could never be bothered to learn my language.
I was always expected to learn to speak.
Well, I don't speak.
Sex was always something I could do as well as hearing girls.
Better!
At first, I let them have me because they wanted to.
Before long, the boys were lined up on a waiting list my sister kept for me.
No introduction, no talk.
Just went to a dark place and...
They didn't even take me out for a Coke first.
That's not what I wanted to know about you.
I thought I was such a big deal... coming on to the deaf girl, giving her a thrill.
No, Sarah.
All the time, you were laughing at me.
I was thinking, "poor little deaf virgin who spread her legs for every..."
You think that I'm threatened by that?
You think that I give a good goddamn that you fucked every pimply-faced teenager?
I don't.
I don't give a shit!
Whoo.
Sarah, please listen to me.
I'm not going away.
I did the wrong thing.
I'm sorry.
I...
I don't know what to say.
Tell me what to say.
Sarah... you are the most mysterious, beautiful, angry person
I have ever met.
I am falling in lo...
Sarah...
Sarah...
I am falling... into the pool with you!
God!
What a fellow has to go through.
My love will get ya
Like a boomerang, baby
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang
Ba-boom...
How are things going, Jim?
Great.
Just great.
Good.
Good.
Glad to hear it.
We've got to have you to the house.
I'd like that.
I warn you, though...
I'm a poker player.
So I've heard.
Are you a card player?
No, not really.
Tic-tac-toe's my game.
So much the better, huh?
Well...
Thanks for coming in, Jim.
We're really happy to have you with us.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Oh, uh... your size?
Yeah.
Be careful, Jimbo.
Right.
Don't fight it.
Relax.
Daphne.
Hmm?
You're leading again.
Sorry.
I got a funny sensation in my toes... like someone was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Let's throw another log on the fire.
Ole!
Ow!
Ow, ow, ow.
You are... the... nicest person...
I've... ever met.
Who, me?
I'm the nicest person you've ever met?
That's the craziest thing that I ever heard.
You thought after what you told me... that you'd never see me again?
Here I am.
Yeah, I was in love, but... she broke my heart.
Oh.
Yeah, I know.
Please don't break my heart.
Did anyone ever break yours?
You don't hurt from other people?
You never hurt from other people?
That's not true.
Sarah, I know people have hurt you.
I know.
Suppose you admitted that you hurt.
I'd... shrivel up and...
I'll take care of you, Sarah.
I'll take care of you.
What do you mean, that was my foul?
You moved into me.
You want to call me an asshole, say it.
No.
Say it out loud.
Watch my lips.
Asshole.
Ah-hole.
Ass... hole.
Ass-hole.
Great!
Asshole.
Good.
It was still your foul.
Asshole!
Did you know that waves strike the average beach about 750,000 times a day?
Wha...
That's true.
I just made it up.
You do?
What do waves sound like?
Whoo.
That is what they sound like.
How did you get to be so brilliant and beautiful?
And pigheaded.
You're the most stubborn person.
Yeah, you.
You're not stubborn?
O.K.
Hi, beautiful.
What am I saying?
Wait.
Sarah, that was a joke.
It wasn't funny.
O.K., I won't do it again.
I promise.
Sarah...
I promise.
Come on!
Mr. Harrison!
How are you?
Couldn't be better, Curtis.
Ah-ha.
Jim Harrison.
He donated the chemistry lab.
Your boy Glen is coming along.
He's a fine lad.
Has he changed that idiotic haircut?
No.
I like to give the kids a lot of leeway.
Asshole!
Shit For Brains!
Look at those shingles.
Guess they'll all have to be replaced.
Thank you, Mr. Jones' class for your informative demonstration of the importance of the four food groups.
has a special treat for us.

Where did they leave it?
In here.
Where in here?
What did they do?
Just a cut, huh?
It's five stitches, huh?
You stupid son of...
She could have seriously hurt herself... in front of a parent.
It's going to stop now.
What?
I don't know what made her upset.
You've got no right to mess her up!
She is not messed up.
I'm not discussing this.
Nobody's going to fuck with one of my students.
She's no student!
She's a 25-year-old woman!
Nobody's going to fuck with one of my employees.
It's going to stop!
She's quitting her job!
She's what?
She's quitting.
She's moving in with me!
Oh.
Oh, I see.
She's going to be your maid now, huh?
Jesus Christ, Franklin.
James, James...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That wasn't fair.
That wasn't fair to Sarah, either.
I've seen this kind of thing before.
It just doesn't work!
This isn't this kind of thing.
This is us.
This is Sarah and me.
I love her!
Sure, the kids made me happy.
Is that against the law?
I don't hate you for not learning how to speak.
Sarah...
Sarah, I...
Iove you.
I need you.
Where are your suitcases?
Aha!
It's your suitcase.
You are moving in with me today.
Here.
I'm packing your clothes.
You'll need some clothes.
Now, it's your turn.
Screw your job.
I got mine.
You can do whatever you want.
Sarah... what do you want?
Me.
You got me.
What else?
Children.
You want... deaf children?
What do you want me to say, that I want deaf children?
No, I don't.
But if they were, that would be fine.
Ah.
Could you get me some more, too?
I don't think she heard me.
Mr. Leeds!
I don't think you're an asshole anymore.
No?
No.
I think you're a... dick-brain.
Dick-brain?
That's fantastic.
I got it right away.
Yeah, Dick-brain.
Really excellent.
Good work.
Choo choo choo choo.
Choo choo choo choo.
Machine, freeze.
Favorite candy, Tony.
Chunky.
Good.
Go.
Freeze.
Favorite animal, Lydia.
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Fine actor, fine actor.
Go!
Freeze.
Favorite football player...
Ooh.
Johnny.
Thank you, Johnny.
And favorite football hero, Cheryl.
Billy "White Shoes" Johnson.
Great choice.
Go.
You ready?
No, Franklin will not expect you to speak.
My God, you look so gorgeous.
I'll get it.
This is great.
I cannot believe this...
James.
And Sarah!
Oh, come in.
Come in, please.
Oh, Martha, Sarah's here, too.
You've taught her to play poker?
Not me.
She learned it out of a book.
Well, about that time.
Sarah knows how to play poker?
It's good to see you again.
You look... mmm!
Here.
Sit next to me.
No, no, no.
No couples together.
Let's break it up.
Come on, break it up.
Sarah... no cheating.
Don't start, Curtis.
I've seen deaf people cheat like bandits.
Come on.
Oh, yes.
Those little signs that no one will see.
Very funny, Franklin.
Don't pay attention to him.
With Jim, of course.
Together, you can clean up.
Jim won't cheat.
He's not deaf.
That's very good.
Very good, Sarah.
Very good.
High card deals.
9. 10.
You're high.
You deal.
Nickel, dime, and quarter.
All of them?
Yes.
Ante up, everybody.
Out of a book, huh?
Five card draw.
One-eyed jacks wild.
One-eyed jacks wild?
One-eyed jacks.
O.K.
You're doing great with her, Jim.
Yeah, what a change.
Pretty impressive, James.
What about the poor guys that lost?
Want these here or in the kitchen?
No, I'll clean up.
It's no bother.
It's fine.
I can't believe how well she played.
There goes my mad money.
Great.
James... where can I get a copy of that book?
You are smart.
She bluffed me.
I folded with three of a kind.
Did you teach her that?
Quite a coup, James.
A lesson for us all.
Oh, God.
God, I can't ever get close enough.
Say my name.
Just once, say my name.
I'm sorry.
I need it...
I'm...
I know I promised.
I'm sorry.
I forgot.
I...
I'm not lying.
I don't want you to speak.
It just came out.
Please, it just...
I'm sorry.
Hike!
No.
No.
I don't care!
They killed my brother.
Don't kill him!
Don't shoot!
They'll shoot you, too!
Get out of my way!
Shoot please!
Do it for me!
Can we have some soda?
Yes.
The phone is ringing.
What?
The phone is ringing.
What phone?
The phone you can't hear because it's so noisy.
Turn that damn thing down.
Good grief.
What am I saying?
The phone is ringing.
The TV is blasting.
The kettle...
If someone would just fire a bazooka through the window.
Can you hold on?
That would be great.
Water's boiling.
Hello.
What?
Ask him to hang on for a second.
It's for you.
It's one of the dorm counselors.
He's translating a call from a deaf man.
It's Orin.
Lydia, Danny!
For god's sake...
It's over.
Bye.
Thank God for small favors.
O.K. You still there?
Great.
You both ready?
We're both ready.
This is Sarah speaking to Orin.
Hi.
Why are you calling?
I'm having a small dinner party.
I want you to come, please.
How about me, please?
Don't translate that to Orin.
Please.
No, I'm not saying please.
Wait a minute.
That was Orin saying please.
Look, it's my fault.
I probably sounded like myself instead of like the dorm counselor sounding like Orin.
He wants you to come to a party for...
Marian Loesser.
Please.
Great.
Um...
She is dying to see you.
Bring James!
Friday at 7:00.
O.K. Fine.
We'll be there.
Yeah.
Thank you.
My God.
Either I just went deaf, or it is suddenly quiet in here.
I do not make everything into a joke.
I possibly obscure...
How the hell would you sign "obscure"?
Obscure.
I'm going to rest my hands and my eyes and listen to 20 minutes of Bach.
You know...
I haven't turned on my hi-fi since you...
Hold it.
That sounds like... like I'm blaming you for me not listening to music.
Thank you.
I will.
I'll rest my hands... and listen to something beautiful.
I can't enjoy it.
I can't, because you can't.
Show you the music?
Let's see...
I can't.
Don't be sad for you.
All right, I won't.
What should you wear to the party?
I don't know.
Have I ever heard of who?
Oh, Marian.
She's the lady the party's for?
No.
Should I have?
She's very famous in the deaf community.
Nice catch.
She has two Ph.D. s, and she doesn't speak.
Take a look at these.
Hungry?
I can't communicate with someone when my mind is busy amusing itself.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
What do you hear?
I mean, is it just silence?
No one has ever gotten in there to find out?
Will you ever let me in?
She's something, isn't she?
Is she a lawyer or something?
Uh-uh.
An economist in Washington.
A real math whiz.
How thrilling.
Yeah.
It is.
I just feel like everyone is talking in some far northern Hungarian dialect over there.
I know the feeling.
Just because I wanted to leave, doesn't mean you wanted to leave.
All right.
Sarah, what the hell is wrong with you tonight?
I'll wait.
Sure.
Marian's great.
So what?
She has everything.
Education.
Great job.
Money.
Well, I'll tell you one thing that she has not got.
Me.
Oh, we're not talking about me for once.
That's true.
Hey...
Let's crawl under the covers, sweetheart, and pretend we're in some... romantic, distant place.
We're not.
We're here.
Right.
O.K.
Let's deal with it.
What is making you so miserable?
Oh...
Let's go to sleep?
No.
You can't start a bonfire and then say night- night.
And you can't start a bonfire and then run away, either.
Oh, you can do anything you want?
Yeah, like what?
Nothing.
I can do nothing.
I'm equipped for nothing and trained for nothing.
You feel like an idiot.
I treat you like an idiot?
I pity you?
Wait a second.
And now you see Marian...
What about Marian?
Let you be you?
I don't?
I want you to be a deaf person so I can change you into a hearing person?
I don't want to help anybody.
I just want to change and control...
Good night.
No... you think that I want you to speak.
And you just want to be you?
Well, who the hell are you?
Right.
What?
God, you want to make love now?
Fuck you, lady.
Oh, that's what you want.
You understood that.
That didn't help much.
Oh, it helped you?
Great.
That's really wonderful.
Makes me happy.
What a night.
I think that helped.
Yeah?
What have you just decided?
No one's ever going to speak for you again?
Come on.
How are you going to manage?
Everyone's always told me who I am, and I let them.
"She wants, she thinks."
And most of the time they were wrong.
They had no idea what I said, wanted, thought.
And now they won't.
Well, that's all right.
I'll buy that.
No, I won't.
How could I?
Because I love you.
Love has nothing to do with it?
That's wonderful.
Then what the hell have we been doing?
Watch your hands?
It's hard to avoid them.
This sign... to connect... simple.
But it means so much more when I do this.
Now it means... to be joined in a relationship.
Separate, but one.
That's what I want.
But you think for me, think for Sarah.
As though there were no "I."
She will be with me, quit her job, learn how to play poker, leave Orin's party, learn how to speak.
That's all you, not me.
Until you let me be an "I,"
the way you are, you can never come inside my silence and know me.
And I won't let myself know you.
Until that time... we can't be like this... joined.
Well... that's all very moving.
But... how are you going to manage?
You can lock yourself back in your precious silent castle...
I heard.
I heard every word, goddamn it.
I translated for myself.
It went from your hands into my brain and out my mouth.
And you know what?
I think you're lying.
I don't think that you think being deaf is so goddamn wonderful.
I think that you're scared to death to try.
I think it's nothing but stupid pride that's keeping you from speaking right.
You want to be on your own.
You don't want to be pitied.
Then you learn to read my lips and use your mouth for something besides showing me you're better than hearing girls in bed.
Read my lips.
What am I saying?
What am...
You want to talk to me, then you learn my language.
Did you understand that?
You've probably been reading lips for years.
But that's the great control game, isn't it?
I'm the controller?
What a fucking joke.
Now, come on!
Speak to me!
Speak!
Speak to me!
Aah!
See my mouth?
Aah!
Hear my voice?
Aah!
Aah!
I'm not afraid!
Hot chocolate.
Your favorite.
Have you... come... home... to stay?
Of course you can.
As long as you like.
You need a job, but there's nothing.
I'll...
I'll...
I'll help.
I... never helped.
Don't... hurt me now.
The last time, you... we... sent you away because...
I didn't know... how to... take care of you.
Your father... couldn't accept you.
He felt... he'd failed.
You're right.
I hated you... for... driving him away.
Please... forgive me.
Telephone.
What...
What should I say?
Hello.
No...
I'm sorry, James.
No, she's not.
All right.
I'll call you if I see her.
Favorite books.
Favorite books.
Good.
Do you have any favorite books, Glen?
Yeah.
Skull?
I'll put that on my summer reading list.
I have to see her.
I know she doesn't want to see me.
She's made that very clear.
But I have to see her.
She'll let you know when she wants to see you.
She's working now.
She's saving her money.
She wants to go to college.
That's fine.
That's wonderful.
Um...
I've looked all over, Mrs. Norman.
Please.
Spring cleaning.
How was your day?
Are you O.K.?
No.
You're not fine.
You're lonely.
He was here.
He misses you.
You don't know what to do.
I think maybe you do.
Hold me
I'll give you all that you need
Wrap your love around me
You're so exciting
I can feel you gettin'hotter
Oh, baby
I'll take you down
I'll take you down
Where no one's ever gone before
And if you want more
If you want more

I didn't know what to do.
You were scared, too.
I hear that Boomerang song.
Ooh, my love can't catch ya
You've been angry since you were a little girl.
You didn't want to hurt again, so you used your anger... to push me away.
You're sorry.
I'm sorry... for hurting you.
But you learned from me.
You learned that you can hurt... and you won't shrivel up and blow away.
I don't want to be without you, either.
Do you think... that we could find a place... where we can meet... not in silence... and not in sound?
[Bell Rings]
This is the most amazing resume I've ever seen.
I've been with some really good schools.
The best.
All of them.
All of the best.
One right after another.
And you've also been with the Lucky Erin Bar and Grill.
Pittsburgh.
Bartender.
And a disc jockey.
In Oklahoma.
I used to broadcast in sign language.
You've been all over the map.
I've got a lot of energy.
I'm sure you do have a lot of energy and a lot of new ideas.
I did, too, when...
But nobody's trying to change the world around here.
Just trying to help a few deaf kids get along a little better, that's all.
Everything else is razzle-dazzle.
Am I, uh... am I making myself clear?
Yes, I believe that you are.
[Buzzing]
Are we being punished?
Hi.
I'm James Leeds, and... my signing is rusty, so how many of you can read lips?
No one?
O.K. Class dismissed.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Just testing.
Sit down.
Lydia and Tony, good lip readers.
Would you mind closing your notebook?
Thank you.
Now, give me one good reason why we should learn to speak.
Tony.
To pick up hearing girls.
To pick up hearing girls.
O.K. Let's work on this.
All right.
Now...
here.
You.
You.
O.K. Here are two beautiful hearing girls.
You two guys want to pick them up.
What is the first thing you want to say, Danny?
Are you rich?
Are you r-i-i-ch?
Say it.
Rich.
Good.
Lydia.
I'm very rich.
Good.
Tony.
Let's go somewhere and do it.
No, thank you.
Let's go somewhere and do it- t.
I would rather do it with her.
Cute.
How about you guys?
You want to join us?
They don't talk.
Fair enough.
O.K. Reasons to talk.
Right.
If your hands are occupied.
For example, some guy owes you money.
He comes by, but you just happen to be in a handstand.
How will you tell him to give you your money?
You can't use your hands.
You've got to speak.
Give me my money, you bum.
Call me names, will you?
I don't have to stand here and take that.
You want to fight, huh?
O.K. Put up your feet and fight like a man.
See?
[Crash]
Take your pots... and your lousy food and shove them...
Doesn't mince words, does she?
Mr. Leeds.
Mr. Leeds.
Oh, Leeds!
Leeds!
Join us.
Sure.
O.K.
Sorry.
Good thing you're out of my classroom.
Sit down, James.
Mary Lee Ochs, Assistant Superintendent.
Orin Dennis, math and social studies.
James Leeds.
Leeds.
Hi.
Did I hear Miss Ochs say you were one of her students?
Yes.
I started here at 5.
Really?
Wow, that's great.
I'm impressed.
For still being here?
Not what I meant.
See you all later.
Bye.
Who is that?
That's Sarah.
Never mind her.
She's a pain in the ass.
But who is she?
What does she do?
She works here.
Orin, I've got an idea.
How about the kids making potholders for parents' day?
They don't sell.
We've got hundreds left from last year.
We do?
Oh.
We do?
Oh.
Sarah came here at 5, too.
We grew up together.
Is she a teacher, too?
She was one of our brightest students.
Would you give me some of the water?
Thank you.
Leeds, you're a genius.
You will work.
[Classical Music Plays]
Ooh.
Yeah.
Mr. Bach.
Hear that... cat?
Ooh.

Come on.

A drip.
[Very Loud] Oh!
What a drip!
No.
No.
No!
No!
That's not what I meant.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm James Leeds.
It's Sarah, isn't it?
Would you like to sit down?
Right here.
O.K. We'll both stand up.
Oh, I see.
Very good.
You got me there.
Could you look at me, please?
If you don't look at me, I can't...
So, um...
Dr. Franklin tells me that you've been here since you were 5.
Mm-hmm.
Um... when did you graduate?
And, uh, now... now...
now you work here?
Are you reading my lips?
I don't think that you are reading my lips.
Ohhh...
Gee, that was quick of me, wasn't it?
You could've told me.
Why?
I don't know.
How about common courtesy?
How about me getting out of here so you can mop the floor?
Man... you know, if you let me,
I bet I could teach you how to speak.
And you could teach me... but I don't want to mop the floor.
Gee, that was quick.
And you don't want to speak.
Brilliant.
Schmuck.
It's a damn shame.
Costly, too.
Resodding is damn costly.
No.
I'm talking about Sarah Norman.
Right.
Sarah.
Look at this, will you?
What a mess.
Has she ever tried speaking?
Sarah's not hard of hearing.
She's totally deaf.
Born that way.
That makes it tough.
The rain's lousing up the fields.
It's a shame that a bright woman is stuck here cleaning toilets.
Doesn't bother her.
Oh, no?
Look, hotshot, not everyone wants to be a star.
Sarah is content.
She had a rotten childhood.
She was diagnosed as retarded until she was 7.
We let her know how smart she was.
For what?
She's productive.
Pays taxes.
Oh, brother.
All right.
You want to try?
I'll talk to her.
Huh?
I'll talk to her.
Look at this.
Will you look at this?
Damn!
It's going to cost $2,000 or $3,000 at least.
Oh, brother.
S-S-Sat.
Sat.
All right.
[Bell Rings]
That's good.
You have to work on S's, though.
O.K.?
Go.
Out.
James, Sarah has agreed to give you an hour.
She's really looking forward to it.
You're really looking forward to it, aren't you?
What did I tell you?
Well, uh...
have fun, Jim... as usual.
Well, Sarah, uh... yeah.
I do mind, actually.
Fire laws and all that, but you go right ahead.
Listen... how would you like to fake out Franklin, make me look real good?
I'm sorry.
I didn't get that.
Uh... if...
I... don't... sign... faster... the hour will be over before I finish my opening speech.
No.
I'm all out of jokes.
Good.
I'm not funny.
Oh, yeah?
If you could hear, you'd think I was a scream.
You're deaf?
Well, I'll try to remember that.
I'll forget?
No, I won't.
Listen, um... why don't we get this thing started here?
Well, thank you for stopping by.
The pleasure was mine.
God.
My mama.
Your mama.
Great.
Go.
Glen, who's your favorite person?
Twisted Sister?
Twisted Sister?
It's the name of the rock group.
Oh.
Oh.
Try saying that.
Twisted Sister.
Glen, it takes courage.
I know.
Just give me one sound.
One. "T."
"T."
Try.
"T."
"T."
Tweeh...
That's great.
That's great.
Yeah.
Out of here.
Go.
Great.
Johnny?
Who's your favorite person?
Princess Di?
Benji?
No.
Terminator?
Uh...
[Bell Rings]
Hey.
Hey, you want to play stand up, sit down again?
Whoa, careful, you almost smiled.
Ah, that's a girl.
That's the Sarah Norman we all know and love.
If my jokes are terrible and my signing is boring, what are you doing here?
There's a whole empty beach.
Unbelievable.
I tried to call your mother.
Hey.
Hold it.
Wait.
Wait.
I can't...
I didn't even talk to her.
O.K.?
I mean, can we stop this?
I mean, why can't we...
I mean, why can't we just... why don't we... why don't we... go out and have some dinner tonight?
Huh?
Just give me a yes or a no.
Yes?
Good.
I think.
O.K. Um...
I will meet you behind, uh... the girls' dormitory, 8:00.
I will whisper your name.
Hey!
I know that sign.
That's the first sign I ever learned.
It's in Italian.
Can I suggest something?
Will you give me a break?
My Italian is worse than my signing.
The veal piccata is very good.
Look.
I'm sorry.
V-E-A-L P-I-C-C-A-T-A.
I mean, you see, by the time I finish, they may be out of it.
It's veal.
It's, uh... sauteed in lemon and butter.
What's veal?
Uh...
God.
What the hell is veal?
Um...
Good evening.
Something to drink this evening?
You want something to drink, Sarah?
Our house wine is very nice.
You want some wine?
Yeah.
It's O.K.
Uh, white wine.
We'll take a carafe, please.
He doesn't think you're stupid.
He thinks you're deaf.
No.
Only stupid hearing people think that deaf people are stupid.
Do you really like being a cleaning woman?
Why?
Yeah.
I mean, there are other jobs where a person can work alone in silence.
Not with toilet bowl cleaner?
You should have told me that was the attraction.
You are smart as hell, you know?
You want to dance?
Can you feel it?
Vibrations... through your nose!

Mrs. Norman?
I'm James Leeds.
I didn't call again... because I would've hung up again.
It's 60 miles here and back.
Please, just five minutes.
I just got home from work.
This is my time to relax.
Discussing Sarah is hardly relaxing.
Five minutes.
Well.
Well.
Uh...
let's see.
You haven't seen Sarah in eight years?
Let's get this straight.
Sarah doesn't want to see me.
Has she said why?
We don't communicate very well.
Did you ever learn to sign?
Some of the parents...
I'm really sick of you people coming here every few years asking the same questions, blaming me.
God.
No one's blaming you.
Of course they are.
They can't blame themselves.
So, it's all my fault.
Fine.
I don't give a damn anymore.
I really just came to ask one question.
What happened when Sarah tried to speak?
What happened?
She looked awful.
She sounded awful.
People made fun of her.
What do you think?
Who made fun of her?
Other kids.
Her sister's friends.
Then she stopped trying to talk.
She's very pretty, you know.
Her sister Ruth had a bunch of boys hanging around, and they started asking Sarah out when she came home on weekends.
It was wonderful for her.
The boys really liked her.
They treated her just like they treated Ruth... with respect.
If you didn't know there was a problem, you would've thought she's perfectly normal.
Hi.
It's true.
I'm early today.
No.
Don't go.
I wanted to talk to you, anyway.
No.
I want to hel... work with you.
I understand that you're scared.
I understand nothing.
Sarah!
Come back here.
Sarah.
Yelling at the back of a deaf person.
Very good, James.
He's been at all the best schools.
Why did you stop going home?
Did your sister's friends, those boys that you were going out with, did they have anything to do with it?
Yes.
I talked to your mother.
Please, let me help you, damn it!
How?
By showing you the joys of sex with a hearing man?
I think that's one language you don't speak.
Yeah, O.K. I'm so...
Come on.
I can take it.
You have more than enough communication skills.
I don't.
They never did?
O.K.
[Stamps Floor]
Hey!
Who is they?
Hearing boys?
They could never be bothered to learn my language.
I was always expected to learn to speak.
Well, I don't speak.
Sex was always something I could do as well as hearing girls.
Better!
At first, I let them have me because they wanted to.
Before long, the boys were lined up on a waiting list my sister kept for me.
No introduction, no talk.
Just went to a dark place and...
They didn't even take me out for a Coke first.
That's not what I wanted to know about you.
I thought I was such a big deal... coming on to the deaf girl, giving her a thrill.
No, Sarah.
All the time, you were laughing at me.
I was thinking, "poor little deaf virgin who spread her legs for every..."
You think that I'm threatened by that?
You think that I give a good goddamn that you fucked every pimply-faced teenager?
I don't.
I don't give a shit!
Whoo.
Sarah, please listen to me.
I'm not going away.
I did the wrong thing.
I'm sorry.
I...
I don't know what to say.
Tell me what to say.
Sarah... you are the most mysterious, beautiful, angry person
I have ever met.
I am falling in lo...
Sarah...
Sarah...
I am falling... into the pool with you!
God!
What a fellow has to go through.

How are things going, Jim?
Great.
Just great.
Good.
Good.
Glad to hear it.
We've got to have you to the house.
I'd like that.
I warn you, though...
I'm a poker player.
So I've heard.
Are you a card player?
No, not really.
Tic-tac-toe's my game.
So much the better, huh?
Well...
Thanks for coming in, Jim.
We're really happy to have you with us.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Oh, uh... your size?
Yeah.
Be careful, Jimbo.
Right.
Don't fight it.
Relax.
[Tango Music Plays]
Daphne.
Hmm?
You're leading again.
Sorry.
I got a funny sensation in my toes... like someone was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Let's throw another log on the fire.
[Tango Music Plays]
Ole!
[Jim] Ow!
Ow, ow, ow.
You are... the... nicest person...
I've... ever met.
Who, me?
I'm the nicest person you've ever met?
That's the craziest thing that I ever heard.
You thought after what you told me... that you'd never see me again?
Here I am.
Yeah, I was in love, but... she broke my heart.
Oh.
Yeah, I know.
Please don't break my heart.
Did anyone ever break yours?
You don't hurt from other people?
You never hurt from other people?
That's not true.
Sarah, I know people have hurt you.
I know.
Suppose you admitted that you hurt.
I'd... shrivel up and...
I'll take care of you, Sarah.
I'll take care of you.
What do you mean, that was my foul?
You moved into me.
You want to call me an asshole, say it.
No.
Say it out loud.
Watch my lips.
Asshole.
Ah-hole.
Ass... hole.
Ass-hole.
Great!
Asshole.
Good.
It was still your foul.
Asshole!
Did you know that waves strike the average beach about 750,000 times a day?
Wha...
That's true.
I just made it up.
You do?
What do waves sound like?
Whoo.
That is what they sound like.
How did you get to be so brilliant and beautiful?
And pigheaded.
You're the most stubborn person.
Yeah, you.
You're not stubborn?
O.K.
Hi, beautiful.
What am I saying?
Wait.
Sarah, that was a joke.
It wasn't funny.
O.K., I won't do it again.
I promise.
Sarah...
I promise.
Come on!
Mr. Harrison!
How are you?
Couldn't be better, Curtis.
Ah-ha.
Jim Harrison.
He donated the chemistry lab.
Your boy Glen is coming along.
He's a fine lad.
Has he changed that idiotic haircut?
No.
I like to give the kids a lot of leeway.
Asshole!
Shit For Brains!
Look at those shingles.
Guess they'll all have to be replaced.

She could have seriously hurt herself... in front of a parent.
It's going to stop now.
What?
I don't know what made her upset.
You've got no right to mess her up!
She is not messed up.
I'm not discussing this.
Nobody's going to fuck with one of my students.
She's no student!
She's a 25-year-old woman!
Nobody's going to fuck with one of my employees.
It's going to stop!
She's quitting her job!
She's what?
She's quitting.
She's moving in with me!
Oh.
Oh, I see.
She's going to be your maid now, huh?
Jesus Christ, Franklin.
James, James...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That wasn't fair.
That wasn't fair to Sarah, either.
I've seen this kind of thing before.
It just doesn't work!
This isn't this kind of thing.
This is us.
This is Sarah and me.
I love her!
Sure, the kids made me happy.
Is that against the law?
I don't hate you for not learning how to speak.
Sarah...
Sarah, I...
Iove you.
I need you.
Where are your suitcases?
Aha!
[Stamps On Floor]
It's your suitcase.
You are moving in with me today.
Here.
I'm packing your clothes.
You'll need some clothes.
Now, it's your turn.
Screw your job.
I got mine.
You can do whatever you want.
Sarah... what do you want?
Me.
You got me.
What else?
Children.
You want... deaf children?
What do you want me to say, that I want deaf children?
No, I don't.
But if they were, that would be fine.
Ah.
Could you get me some more, too?
I don't think she heard me.
Mr. Leeds!
I don't think you're an asshole anymore.
No?
No.
I think you're a... dick-brain.
Dick-brain?
That's fantastic.
I got it right away.
Yeah, Dick-brain.
Really excellent.

No, Franklin will not expect you to speak.
My God, you look so gorgeous.
[Doorbell Rings]
I'll get it.
This is great.
I cannot believe this...
James.
And Sarah!
Oh, come in.
Come in, please.
Oh, Martha, Sarah's here, too.
You've taught her to play poker?
Not me.
She learned it out of a book.
Well, about that time.
Sarah knows how to play poker?
It's good to see you again.
You look... mmm!
Here.
Sit next to me.
No, no, no.
No couples together.
Let's break it up.
Come on, break it up.
Sarah... no cheating.
Don't start, Curtis.
I've seen deaf people cheat like bandits.
Come on.
Oh, yes.
Those little signs that no one will see.
Very funny, Franklin.
Don't pay attention to him.
With Jim, of course.
Together, you can clean up.
Jim won't cheat.
He's not deaf.
That's very good.
Very good, Sarah.
Very good.
High card deals.
9. 10.
You're high.
You deal.
Nickel, dime, and quarter.
All of them?
Yes.
Ante up, everybody.
Out of a book, huh?
Five card draw.
One-eyed jacks wild.
One-eyed jacks wild?
One-eyed jacks.
O.K.
You're doing great with her, Jim.
Yeah, what a change.
Pretty impressive, James.
What about the poor guys that lost?
Want these here or in the kitchen?
No, I'll clean up.
It's no bother.
It's fine.
I can't believe how well she played.
There goes my mad money.
Great.
James... where can I get a copy of that book?
You are smart.
She bluffed me.
I folded with three of a kind.
Did you teach her that?
Quite a coup, James.
A lesson for us all.
Oh, God.
God, I can't ever get close enough.
Say my name.
Just once, say my name.
I'm sorry.
I need it...
I'm...
I know I promised.
I'm sorry.
I forgot.
I...
I'm not lying.
I don't want you to speak.
It just came out.
Please, it just...
I'm sorry.
Hike!
No.
No.
I don't care!
They killed my brother.
Don't kill him!
Don't shoot!
They'll shoot you, too!
Get out of my way!
Shoot please!
Do it for me!
[Gunshots]
Can we have some soda?
Yes.
[Telephone Rings]
The phone is ringing.
What?
The phone is ringing.
What phone?
The phone you can't hear because it's so noisy.
Turn that damn thing down.
Good grief.
What am I saying?
[Ring]
The phone is ringing.
The TV is blasting.
[Teakettle Whistles]
The kettle...
If someone would just fire a bazooka through the window.
[Gunshots]
Can you hold on?
That would be great.
Water's boiling.
Hello.
What?
Ask him to hang on for a second.
[Tires Squealing]
It's for you.
It's one of the dorm counselors.
He's translating a call from a deaf man.
It's Orin.
Lydia, Danny!
For god's sake...
It's over.
Bye.
Thank God for small favors.
O.K. You still there?
Great.
You both ready?
We're both ready.
This is Sarah speaking to Orin.
Hi.
Why are you calling?
I'm having a small dinner party.
I want you to come, please.
How about me, please?
Don't translate that to Orin.
Please.
No, I'm not saying please.
Wait a minute.
That was Orin saying please.
Look, it's my fault.
I probably sounded like myself instead of like the dorm counselor sounding like Orin.
He wants you to come to a party for...
Marian Loesser.
Please.
Great.
Um...
She is dying to see you.
Bring James!
Friday at 7:00.
O.K. Fine.
We'll be there.
Yeah.
Thank you.
My God.
Either I just went deaf, or it is suddenly quiet in here.
I do not make everything into a joke.
I possibly obscure...
How the hell would you sign "obscure"?
Obscure.
I'm going to rest my hands and my eyes and listen to 20 minutes of Bach.
You know...
I haven't turned on my hi-fi since you...
Hold it.
That sounds like... like I'm blaming you for me not listening to music.
Thank you.
I will.
I'll rest my hands... and listen to something beautiful.
[Bach Plays]
I can't enjoy it.
I can't, because you can't.
[Bach Plays]
Show you the music?
Let's see...
I can't.
Don't be sad for you.
All right, I won't.
What should you wear to the party?
I don't know.
Have I ever heard of who?
Oh, Marian.
She's the lady the party's for?
No.
Should I have?
She's very famous in the deaf community.
Nice catch.
She has two Ph.D. s, and she doesn't speak.
Take a look at these.
Hungry?
I can't communicate with someone when my mind is busy amusing itself.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
What do you hear?
I mean, is it just silence?
No one has ever gotten in there to find out?
Will you ever let me in?
She's something, isn't she?
Is she a lawyer or something?
Uh-uh.
An economist in Washington.
A real math whiz.
How thrilling.
Yeah.
It is.
I just feel like everyone is talking in some far northern Hungarian dialect over there.
I know the feeling.
Just because I wanted to leave, doesn't mean you wanted to leave.
All right.
Sarah, what the hell is wrong with you tonight?
I'll wait.
Sure.
Marian's great.
So what?
She has everything.
Education.
Great job.
Money.
Well, I'll tell you one thing that she has not got.
Me.
Oh, we're not talking about me for once.
That's true.
Hey...
Let's crawl under the covers, sweetheart, and pretend we're in some... romantic, distant place.
We're not.
We're here.
Right.
O.K.
Let's deal with it.
What is making you so miserable?
Oh...
Let's go to sleep?
No.
You can't start a bonfire and then say night- night.
And you can't start a bonfire and then run away, either.
Oh, you can do anything you want?
Yeah, like what?
Nothing.
I can do nothing.
I'm equipped for nothing and trained for nothing.
You feel like an idiot.
I treat you like an idiot?
I pity you?
Wait a second.
And now you see Marian...
What about Marian?
Let you be you?
I don't?
I want you to be a deaf person so I can change you into a hearing person?
I don't want to help anybody.
I just want to change and control...
Good night.
No... you think that I want you to speak.
And you just want to be you?
Well, who the hell are you?
Right.
[Stamps Floor]
What?
God, you want to make love now?
Fuck you, lady.
Oh, that's what you want.
You understood that.
That didn't help much.
Oh, it helped you?
Great.
That's really wonderful.
Makes me happy.
What a night.
I think that helped.
Yeah?
What have you just decided?
No one's ever going to speak for you again?
Come on.
How are you going to manage?
Everyone's always told me who I am, and I let them.
"She wants, she thinks."
And most of the time they were wrong.
They had no idea what I said, wanted, thought.
And now they won't.
Well, that's all right.
I'll buy that.
No, I won't.
How could I?
Because I love you.
Love has nothing to do with it?
That's wonderful.
Then what the hell have we been doing?
Watch your hands?
It's hard to avoid them.
This sign... to connect... simple.
But it means so much more when I do this.
Now it means... to be joined in a relationship.
Separate, but one.
That's what I want.
But you think for me, think for Sarah.
As though there were no "I."
She will be with me, quit her job, learn how to play poker, leave Orin's party, learn how to speak.
That's all you, not me.
Until you let me be an "I,"
the way you are, you can never come inside my silence and know me.
And I won't let myself know you.
Until that time... we can't be like this... joined.
Well... that's all very moving.
But... how are you going to manage?
You can lock yourself back in your precious silent castle...
I heard.
I heard every word, goddamn it.
I translated for myself.
It went from your hands into my brain and out my mouth.
And you know what?
I think you're lying.
I don't think that you think being deaf is so goddamn wonderful.
I think that you're scared to death to try.
I think it's nothing but stupid pride that's keeping you from speaking right.
You want to be on your own.
You don't want to be pitied.
Then you learn to read my lips and use your mouth for something besides showing me you're better than hearing girls in bed.
Read my lips.
What am I saying?
What am...
You want to talk to me, then you learn my language.
Did you understand that?
You've probably been reading lips for years.
But that's the great control game, isn't it?
I'm the controller?
What a fucking joke.
Now, come on!
Speak to me!
Speak!
Speak to me!
Aah!
See my mouth?
Aah!
Hear my voice?
Aah!
Aah!
I'm not afraid!
Hot chocolate.
Your favorite.
Have you... come... home... to stay?
Of course you can.
As long as you like.
You need a job, but there's nothing.
I'll...
I'll...
I'll help.
I... never helped.
Don't... hurt me now.
The last time, you... we... sent you away because...
I didn't know... how to... take care of you.
Your father... couldn't accept you.
He felt... he'd failed.
You're right.
I hated you... for... driving him away.
Please... forgive me.

[Ring]
Hello.
No...
I'm sorry, James.
No, she's not.
All right.
I'll call you if I see her.
[Bach Plays]
Favorite books.
Favorite books.
Good.
Do you have any favorite books, Glen?
Yeah.
Skull?
I'll put that on my summer reading list.
I have to see her.
I know she doesn't want to see me.
She's made that very clear.
But I have to see her.
She'll let you know when she wants to see you.
She's working now.
She's saving her money.
She wants to go to college.
That's fine.
That's wonderful.
Um...
I've looked all over, Mrs. Norman.
Please.
Spring cleaning.
How was your day?
Are you O.K.?
No.
You're not fine.
You're lonely.
[Music Box Plays]
He was here.
He misses you.
You don't know what to do.
I think maybe you do.

You've been angry since you were a little girl.
You didn't want to hurt again, so you used your anger... to push me away.

I'm sorry... for hurting you.
But you learned from me.
You learned that you can hurt... and you won't shrivel up and blow away.
I don't want to be without you, either.
Do you think... that we could find a place... where we can meet... not in silence... and not in sound?
[Waves Crashing]
[Bell Rings]
This is the most amazing resume I've ever seen.
I've been with some really good schools.
The best.
All of them.
All of the best.
One right after another.
And you've also been with the Lucky Erin Bar and Grill.
Pittsburgh.
Bartender.
And a disc jockey.
In Oklahoma.
I used to broadcast in sign language.
You've been all over the map.
I've got a lot of energy.
I'm sure you do have a lot of energy and a lot of new ideas.
I did, too, when...
But nobody's trying to change the world around here.
Just trying to help a few deaf kids get along a little better, that's all.
Everything else is razzle-dazzle.
Am I, uh... am I making myself clear?
Yes, I believe that you are.
[Buzzing]
Are we being punished?
Hi.
I'm James Leeds, and... my signing is rusty, so how many of you can read lips?
No one?
O.K. Class dismissed.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Just testing.
Sit down.
Lydia and Tony, good lip readers.
Would you mind closing your notebook?
Thank you.
Now, give me one good reason why we should learn to speak.
Tony.
To pick up hearing girls.
To pick up hearing girls.
O.K. Let's work on this.
All right.
Now...
here.
You.
You.
O.K. Here are two beautiful hearing girls.
You two guys want to pick them up.
What is the first thing you want to say, Danny?
Are you rich?
Are you r-i-i-ch?
Say it.
Rich.
Good.
Lydia.
I'm very rich.
Good.
Tony.
Let's go somewhere and do it.
No, thank you.
Let's go somewhere and do it-t.
I would rather do it with her.
Cute.
How about you guys?
You want to join us?
They don't talk.
Fair enough.
O.K. Reasons to talk.
Right.
If your hands are occupied.
For example, some guy owes you money.
He comes by, but you just happen to be in a handstand.
How will you tell him to give you your money?
You can't use your hands.
You've got to speak.
Give me my money, you bum.
Call me names, will you?
I don't have to stand here and take that.
You want to fight, huh?
O.K. Put up your feet and fight like a man.
See?
[Crash]
Take your pots... and your lousy food and shove them...
Doesn't mince words, does she?
Mr. Leeds.
Mr. Leeds.
Oh, Leeds!
Leeds!
Join us.
Sure.
O.K.
Sorry.
Good thing you're out of my classroom.
Sit down, James.
Mary Lee Ochs, Assistant Superintendent.
Orin Dennis, math and social studies.
James Leeds.
Leeds.
Hi.
Did I hear Miss Ochs say you were one of her students?
Yes.
I started here at 5.
Really?
Wow, that's great.
I'm impressed.
For still being here?
Not what I meant.
See you all later.
Bye.
Who is that?
That's Sarah.
Never mind her.
She's a pain in the ass.
But who is she?
What does she do?
She works here.
Orin, I've got an idea.
How about the kids making potholders for parents' day?
They don't sell.
We've got hundreds left from last year.
We do?
Oh.
We do?
Oh.
Sarah came here at 5, too.
We grew up together.
Is she a teacher, too?
She was one of our brightest students.
Would you give me some of the water?
Thank you.
Leeds, you're a genius.
You will work.

[Very Loud] Oh!
What a drip!
No.
No.
No!
No!
That's not what I meant.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm James Leeds.
It's Sarah, isn't it?
Would you like to sit down?
Right here.
O.K. We'll both stand up.
Oh, I see.
Very good.
You got me there.
Could you look at me, please?
If you don't look at me, I can't...
So, um...
Dr. Franklin tells me that you've been here since you were 5.
Mm-hmm.
Um... when did you graduate?
And, uh, now... now...
now you work here?
Are you reading my lips?
I don't think that you are reading my lips.
Ohhh...
Gee, that was quick of me, wasn't it?
You could've told me.
Why?
I don't know.
How about common courtesy?
How about me getting out of here so you can mop the floor?
Man... you know, if you let me,
I bet I could teach you how to speak.
And you could teach me... but I don't want to mop the floor.
Gee, that was quick.
And you don't want to speak.
Brilliant.
Schmuck.
It's a damn shame.
Costly, too.
Resodding is damn costly.
No.
I'm talking about Sarah Norman.
Right.
Sarah.
Look at this, will you?
What a mess.
Has she ever tried speaking?
Sarah's not hard of hearing.
She's totally deaf.
Born that way.
That makes it tough.
The rain's lousing up the fields.
It's a shame that a bright woman is stuck here cleaning toilets.
Doesn't bother her.
Oh, no?
Look, hotshot, not everyone wants to be a star.
Sarah is content.
She had a rotten childhood.
She was diagnosed as retarded until she was 7.
We let her know how smart she was.
For what?
She's productive.
Pays taxes.
Oh, brother.
All right.
You want to try?
I'll talk to her.
Huh?
I'll talk to her.
Look at this.
Will you look at this?
Damn!
It's going to cost $2,000 or $3,000 at least.
Oh, brother.
S-S-Sat.
Sat.
All right.
[Bell Rings]
That's good.
You have to work on S's, though.
O.K.?
Go.
Out.
James, Sarah has agreed to give you an hour.
She's really looking forward to it.
You're really looking forward to it, aren't you?
What did I tell you?
Well, uh...
have fun, Jim... as usual.
Well, Sarah, uh... yeah.
I do mind, actually.
Fire laws and all that, but you go right ahead.
Listen... how would you like to fake out Franklin, make me look real good?
I'm sorry.
I didn't get that.
Uh... if...
I... don't... sign... faster... the hour will be over before I finish my opening speech.
No.
I'm all out of jokes.
Good.
I'm not funny.
Oh, yeah?
If you could hear, you'd think I was a scream.
You're deaf?
Well, I'll try to remember that.
I'll forget?
No, I won't.
Listen, um... why don't we get this thing started here?
Well, thank you for stopping by.
The pleasure was mine.
God.
My mama.
Your mama.
Great.
Go.
Glen, who's your favorite person?
Twisted Sister?
Twisted Sister?
It's the name of the rock group.
Oh.
Oh.
Try saying that.
Twisted Sister.
Glen, it takes courage.
I know.
Just give me one sound.
One. "T."
"T."
Try.
"T."
"T."
Tweeh...
That's great.
That's great.
Yeah.
Out of here.
Go.
Great.
Johnny?
Who's your favorite person?
Princess Di?
Benji?
No.
Terminator?
Uh...
[Bell Rings]
Hey.
Hey, you want to play stand up, sit down again?
Whoa, careful, you almost smiled.
Ah, that's a girl.
That's the Sarah Norman we all know and love.
If my jokes are terrible and my signing is boring, what are you doing here?
There's a whole empty beach.
Unbelievable.
I tried to call your mother.
Hey.
Hold it.
Wait.
Wait.
I can't...
I didn't even talk to her.
O.K.?
I mean, can we stop this?
I mean, why can't we...
I mean, why can't we just... why don't we... why don't we... go out and have some dinner tonight?
Huh?
Just give me a yes or a no.
Yes?
Good.
I think.
O.K. Um...
I will meet you behind, uh... the girls' dormitory, 8:00.
I will whisper your name.
Hey!
I know that sign.
That's the first sign I ever learned.
It's in Italian.
Can I suggest something?
Will you give me a break?
My Italian is worse than my signing.
The veal piccata is very good.
Look.
I'm sorry.
V-E-A-L P-I-C-C-A-T-A.
I mean, you see, by the time I finish, they may be out of it.
It's veal.
It's, uh... sauteed in lemon and butter.
What's veal?
Uh...
God.
What the hell is veal?
Um...
Good evening.
Something to drink this evening?
You want something to drink, Sarah?
Our house wine is very nice.
You want some wine?
Yeah.
It's O.K.
Uh, white wine.
We'll take a carafe, please.
He doesn't think you're stupid.
He thinks you're deaf.
No.
Only stupid hearing people think that deaf people are stupid.
Do you really like being a cleaning woman?
Why?
Yeah.
I mean, there are other jobs where a person can work alone in silence.
Not with toilet bowl cleaner?
You should have told me that was the attraction.
You are smart as hell, you know?
You want to dance?
Can you feel it?
Vibrations... through your nose!

No one wants my help?
That's your opinion.
That's fine.

It's... my pleasure.
Mrs. Norman?
I'm James Leeds.
I didn't call again... because I would've hung up again.
It's 60 miles here and back.
Please, just five minutes.
I just got home from work.
This is my time to relax.
Discussing Sarah is hardly relaxing.
Five minutes.
Well.
Well.
Uh...
let's see.
You haven't seen Sarah in eight years?
Let's get this straight.
Sarah doesn't want to see me.
Has she said why?
We don't communicate very well.
Did you ever learn to sign?
Some of the parents...
I'm really sick of you people coming here every few years asking the same questions, blaming me.
God.
No one's blaming you.
Of course they are.
They can't blame themselves.
So, it's all my fault.
Fine.
I don't give a damn anymore.
I really just came to ask one question.
What happened when Sarah tried to speak?
What happened?
She looked awful.
She sounded awful.
People made fun of her.
What do you think?
Who made fun of her?
Other kids.
Her sister's friends.
Then she stopped trying to talk.
She's very pretty, you know.
Her sister Ruth had a bunch of boys hanging around, and they started asking Sarah out when she came home on weekends.
It was wonderful for her.
The boys really liked her.
They treated her just like they treated Ruth... with respect.
If you didn't know there was a problem, you would've thought she's perfectly normal.
Hi.
It's true.
I'm early today.
No.
Don't go.
I wanted to talk to you, anyway.
No.
I want to hel... work with you.
I understand that you're scared.
I understand nothing.
Sarah!
Come back here.
Sarah.
Yelling at the back of a deaf person.
Very good, James.
He's been at all the best schools.
Why did you stop going home?
Did your sister's friends, those boys that you were going out with, did they have anything to do with it?
Yes.
I talked to your mother.
Please, let me help you, damn it!
How?
By showing you the joys of sex with a hearing man?
I think that's one language you don't speak.
Yeah, O.K. I'm so...
Come on.
I can take it.
You have more than enough communication skills.
I don't.
They never did?
O.K.
[Stamps Floor]
Hey!
Who is they?
Hearing boys?
They could never be bothered to learn my language.
I was always expected to learn to speak.
Well, I don't speak.
Sex was always something I could do as well as hearing girls.
Better!
At first, I let them have me because they wanted to.
Before long, the boys were lined up on a waiting list my sister kept for me.
No introduction, no talk.
Just went to a dark place and...
They didn't even take me out for a Coke first.
That's not what I wanted to know about you.
I thought I was such a big deal... coming on to the deaf girl, giving her a thrill.
No, Sarah.
All the time, you were laughing at me.
I was thinking, "poor little deaf virgin who spread her legs for every..."
You think that I'm threatened by that?
You think that I give a good goddamn that you fucked every pimply-faced teenager?
I don't.
I don't give a shit!
Whoo.
Sarah, please listen to me.
I'm not going away.
I did the wrong thing.
I'm sorry.
I...
I don't know what to say.
Tell me what to say.
Sarah... you are the most mysterious, beautiful, angry person
I have ever met.
I am falling in lo...
Sarah...
Sarah...
I am falling... into the pool with you!
God!
What a fellow has to go through.

I'd like that.
I warn you, though...
I'm a poker player.
So I've heard.
Are you a card player?
No, not really.
Tic-tac-toe's my game.

Thanks for coming in, Jim.
We're really happy to have you with us.

Daphne.
Hmm?
You're leading again.
Sorry.
I got a funny sensation in my toes... like someone was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Let's throw another log on the fire.
[Tango Music Plays]
Ole!
[Jim] Ow!
Ow, ow, ow.
You are... the... nicest person...
I've... ever met.
Who, me?
I'm the nicest person you've ever met?
That's the craziest thing that I ever heard.
You thought after what you told me... that you'd never see me again?
Here I am.
Yeah, I was in love, but... she broke my heart.
Oh.
Yeah, I know.
Please don't break my heart.
Did anyone ever break yours?
You don't hurt from other people?
You never hurt from other people?
That's not true.
Sarah, I know people have hurt you.
I know.
Suppose you admitted that you hurt.
I'd... shrivel up and...
I'll take care of you, Sarah.
I'll take care of you.
What do you mean, that was my foul?
You moved into me.
You want to call me an asshole, say it.
No.
Say it out loud.
Watch my lips.
Asshole.
Ah-hole.
Ass... hole.
Ass-hole.
Great!
Asshole.
Good.
It was still your foul.
Asshole!
Did you know that waves strike the average beach about 750,000 times a day?
Wha...
That's true.
I just made it up.
You do?
What do waves sound like?
Whoo.
That is what they sound like.
How did you get to be so brilliant and beautiful?
And pigheaded.
You're the most stubborn person.
Yeah, you.
You're not stubborn?
O.K.
Hi, beautiful.
What am I saying?
Wait.
Sarah, that was a joke.
It wasn't funny.
O.K., I won't do it again.
I promise.
Sarah...
I promise.
Come on!
Mr. Harrison!
How are you?
Couldn't be better, Curtis.
Ah-ha.
Jim Harrison.
He donated the chemistry lab.
Your boy Glen is coming along.
He's a fine lad.
Has he changed that idiotic haircut?
No.

Where did they leave it?
In here.
Where in here?
What did they do?
Just a cut, huh?
It's five stitches, huh?
You stupid son of...
She could have seriously hurt herself... in front of a parent.
It's going to stop now.
What?
I don't know what made her upset.
You've got no right to mess her up!
She is not messed up.
I'm not discussing this.
Nobody's going to fuck with one of my students.
She's no student!
She's a 25-year-old woman!
Nobody's going to fuck with one of my employees.
It's going to stop!
She's quitting her job!
She's what?
She's quitting.
She's moving in with me!
Oh.
Oh, I see.
She's going to be your maid now, huh?
Jesus Christ, Franklin.
James, James...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That wasn't fair.
That wasn't fair to Sarah, either.
I've seen this kind of thing before.
It just doesn't work!
This isn't this kind of thing.
This is us.
This is Sarah and me.
I love her!
Sure, the kids made me happy.
Is that against the law?
I don't hate you for not learning how to speak.
Sarah...
Sarah, I...
Iove you.
I need you.
Where are your suitcases?
Aha!
[Stamps On Floor]
It's your suitcase.
You are moving in with me today.
Here.
I'm packing your clothes.
You'll need some clothes.
Now, it's your turn.
Screw your job.
I got mine.
You can do whatever you want.
Sarah... what do you want?
Me.
You got me.
What else?
Children.
You want... deaf children?
What do you want me to say, that I want deaf children?
No, I don't.
But if they were, that would be fine.
Ah.
Could you get me some more, too?
I don't think she heard me.
Mr. Leeds!
I don't think you're an asshole anymore.
No?
No.
I think you're a... dick-brain.
Dick-brain?
That's fantastic.
I got it right away.
Yeah, Dick-brain.
Really excellent.
Good work.
Choo choo choo choo.
Choo choo choo choo.
Machine, freeze.
Favorite candy, Tony.
Chunky.
Good.
Go.
Freeze.
Favorite animal, Lydia.
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Fine actor, fine actor.
Go!
Freeze.
Favorite football player...
Ooh.
Johnny.
Thank you, Johnny.
And favorite football hero, Cheryl.
Billy "White Shoes" Johnson.
Great choice.
Go.
You ready?
No, Franklin will not expect you to speak.
My God, you look so gorgeous.
[Doorbell Rings]
I'll get it.
This is great.
I cannot believe this...
James.
And Sarah!
Oh, come in.
Come in, please.
Oh, Martha, Sarah's here, too.
You've taught her to play poker?
Not me.
She learned it out of a book.
Well, about that time.
Sarah knows how to play poker?
It's good to see you again.
You look... mmm!
Here.
Sit next to me.
No, no, no.
No couples together.
Let's break it up.
Come on, break it up.
Sarah... no cheating.
Don't start, Curtis.
I've seen deaf people cheat like bandits.
Come on.
Oh, yes.
Those little signs that no one will see.
Very funny, Franklin.
Don't pay attention to him.
With Jim, of course.
Together, you can clean up.
Jim won't cheat.
He's not deaf.
That's very good.
Very good, Sarah.
Very good.
High card deals.
9. 10.
You're high.
You deal.
Nickel, dime, and quarter.
All of them?
Yes.
Ante up, everybody.
Out of a book, huh?
Five card draw.
One-eyed jacks wild.
One-eyed jacks wild?
One-eyed jacks.
O.K.
You're doing great with her, Jim.
Yeah, what a change.
Pretty impressive, James.
What about the poor guys that lost?
Want these here or in the kitchen?
No, I'll clean up.
It's no bother.
It's fine.
I can't believe how well she played.
There goes my mad money.
Great.
James... where can I get a copy of that book?
You are smart.
She bluffed me.
I folded with three of a kind.
Did you teach her that?
Quite a coup, James.
A lesson for us all.
Oh, God.
God, I can't ever get close enough.
Say my name.
Just once, say my name.
I'm sorry.
I need it...
I'm...
I know I promised.
I'm sorry.
I forgot.
I...
I'm not lying.
I don't want you to speak.
It just came out.
Please, it just...
I'm sorry.
Hike!
No.
No.
I don't care!
They killed my brother.
Don't kill him!
Don't shoot!
They'll shoot you, too!
Get out of my way!
Shoot please!
Do it for me!
[Gunshots]
Can we have some soda?
Yes.
[Telephone Rings]
The phone is ringing.
What?
The phone is ringing.
What phone?
The phone you can't hear because it's so noisy.
Turn that damn thing down.
Good grief.
What am I saying?
[Ring]
The phone is ringing.
The TV is blasting.
[Teakettle Whistles]
The kettle...
If someone would just fire a bazooka through the window.
[Gunshots]
Can you hold on?
That would be great.
Water's boiling.
Hello.
What?
Ask him to hang on for a second.
[Tires Squealing]
It's for you.
It's one of the dorm counselors.
He's translating a call from a deaf man.
It's Orin.
Lydia, Danny!
For god's sake...
It's over.
Bye.
Thank God for small favors.
O.K. You still there?
Great.
You both ready?
We're both ready.
This is Sarah speaking to Orin.
Hi.
Why are you calling?
I'm having a small dinner party.
I want you to come, please.
How about me, please?
Don't translate that to Orin.
Please.
No, I'm not saying please.
Wait a minute.
That was Orin saying please.
Look, it's my fault.
I probably sounded like myself instead of like the dorm counselor sounding like Orin.
He wants you to come to a party for...
Marian Loesser.
Please.
Great.
Um...
She is dying to see you.
Bring James!
Friday at 7:00.
O.K. Fine.
We'll be there.
Yeah.
Thank you.
My God.
Either I just went deaf, or it is suddenly quiet in here.
I do not make everything into a joke.
I possibly obscure...
How the hell would you sign "obscure"?
Obscure.
I'm going to rest my hands and my eyes and listen to 20 minutes of Bach.
You know...
I haven't turned on my hi-fi since you...
Hold it.
That sounds like... like I'm blaming you for me not listening to music.
Thank you.
I will.
I'll rest my hands... and listen to something beautiful.
[Bach Plays]
I can't enjoy it.
I can't, because you can't.
[Bach Plays]
Show you the music?
Let's see...
I can't.
Don't be sad for you.
All right, I won't.
What should you wear to the party?
I don't know.
Have I ever heard of who?
Oh, Marian.
She's the lady the party's for?
No.
Should I have?
She's very famous in the deaf community.
Nice catch.
She has two Ph.D. s, and she doesn't speak.
Take a look at these.
Hungry?
I can't communicate with someone when my mind is busy amusing itself.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
What do you hear?
I mean, is it just silence?
No one has ever gotten in there to find out?
Will you ever let me in?
She's something, isn't she?
Is she a lawyer or something?
Uh-uh.
An economist in Washington.
A real math whiz.
How thrilling.
Yeah.
It is.
I just feel like everyone is talking in some far northern Hungarian dialect over there.
I know the feeling.
Just because I wanted to leave, doesn't mean you wanted to leave.
All right.
Sarah, what the hell is wrong with you tonight?
I'll wait.
Sure.
Marian's great.
So what?
She has everything.
Education.
Great job.
Money.
Well, I'll tell you one thing that she has not got.
Me.
Oh, we're not talking about me for once.
That's true.
Hey...
Let's crawl under the covers, sweetheart, and pretend we're in some... romantic, distant place.
We're not.
We're here.
Right.
O.K.
Let's deal with it.
What is making you so miserable?
Oh...
Let's go to sleep?
No.
You can't start a bonfire and then say night-night.
And you can't start a bonfire and then run away, either.
Oh, you can do anything you want?
Yeah, like what?
Nothing.
I can do nothing.
I'm equipped for nothing and trained for nothing.
You feel like an idiot.
I treat you like an idiot?
I pity you?
Wait a second.
And now you see Marian...
What about Marian?
Let you be you?
I don't?
I want you to be a deaf person so I can change you into a hearing person?
I don't want to help anybody.
I just want to change and control...
Good night.
No... you think that I want you to speak.
And you just want to be you?
Well, who the hell are you?
Right.
[Stamps Floor]
What?
God, you want to make love now?
Fuck you, lady.
Oh, that's what you want.
You understood that.
That didn't help much.
Oh, it helped you?
Great.
That's really wonderful.
Makes me happy.
What a night.
I think that helped.
Yeah?
What have you just decided?
No one's ever going to speak for you again?
Come on.
How are you going to manage?
Everyone's always told me who I am, and I let them.
"She wants, she thinks."
And most of the time they were wrong.
They had no idea what I said, wanted, thought.
And now they won't.
Well, that's all right.
I'll buy that.
No, I won't.
How could I?
Because I love you.
Love has nothing to do with it?
That's wonderful.
Then what the hell have we been doing?
Watch your hands?
It's hard to avoid them.
This sign... to connect... simple.
But it means so much more when I do this.
Now it means... to be joined in a relationship.
Separate, but one.
That's what I want.
But you think for me, think for Sarah.
As though there were no "I."
She will be with me, quit her job, learn how to play poker, leave Orin's party, learn how to speak.
That's all you, not me.
Until you let me be an "I,"
the way you are, you can never come inside my silence and know me.
And I won't let myself know you.
Until that time... we can't be like this... joined.
Well... that's all very moving.
But... how are you going to manage?
You can lock yourself back in your precious silent castle...
I heard.
I heard every word, goddamn it.
I translated for myself.
It went from your hands into my brain and out my mouth.
And you know what?
I think you're lying.
I don't think that you think being deaf is so goddamn wonderful.
I think that you're scared to death to try.
I think it's nothing but stupid pride that's keeping you from speaking right.
You want to be on your own.
You don't want to be pitied.
Then you learn to read my lips and use your mouth for something besides showing me you're better than hearing girls in bed.
Read my lips.
What am I saying?
What am...
You want to talk to me, then you learn my language.
Did you understand that?
You've probably been reading lips for years.
But that's the great control game, isn't it?
I'm the controller?
What a fucking joke.
Now, come on!
Speak to me!
Speak!
Speak to me!
Aah!
See my mouth?
Aah!
Hear my voice?
Aah!
Aah!
I'm not afraid!
Hot chocolate.
Your favorite.
Have you... come... home... to stay?
Of course you can.
As long as you like.
You need a job, but there's nothing.
I'll...
I'll...
I'll help.
I... never helped.
Don't... hurt me now.
The last time, you... we... sent you away because...
I didn't know... how to... take care of you.
Your father... couldn't accept you.
He felt... he'd failed.
You're right.
I hated you... for... driving him away.
Please... forgive me.
[Telephone Rings]
[Ring]
Telephone.
What...
What should I say?
[Ring]
[Ring]
[Ring]
Hello.
No...
I'm sorry, James.
No, she's not.
All right.
I'll call you if I see her.
[Bach Plays]
Favorite books.
Favorite books.
Good.
Do you have any favorite books, Glen?
Yeah.
Skull?
I'll put that on my summer reading list.
I have to see her.
I know she doesn't want to see me.
She's made that very clear.
But I have to see her.
She'll let you know when she wants to see you.
She's working now.
She's saving her money.
She wants to go to college.
That's fine.
That's wonderful.
Um...
I've looked all over, Mrs. Norman.
Please.
Spring cleaning.
How was your day?
Are you O.K.?
No.
You're not fine.
You're lonely.
[Music Box Plays]
He was here.
He misses you.
You don't know what to do.
I think maybe you do.

You've been angry since you were a little girl.
You didn't want to hurt again, so you used your anger... to push me away.

But you learned from me.
You learned that you can hurt... and you won't shrivel up and blow away.
I don't want to be without you, either.
Do you think... that we could find a place... where we can meet... not in silence... and not in sound?
[Waves Crashing]
[Bell Rings]
This is the most amazing resume I've ever seen.
I've been with some really good schools.
The best.
All of them.
All of the best.
One right after another.
And you've also been with the Lucky Erin Bar and Grill.
Pittsburgh.
Bartender.
And a disc jockey.
In Oklahoma.
I used to broadcast in sign language.
You've been all over the map.
I've got a lot of energy.
I'm sure you do have a lot of energy and a lot of new ideas.
I did, too, when...
But nobody's trying to change the world around here.
Just trying to help a few deaf kids get along a little better, that's all.
Everything else is razzle-dazzle.
Am I, uh... am I making myself clear?
Yes, I believe that you are.
[Buzzing]
Are we being punished?
Hi.
I'm James Leeds, and... my signing is rusty, so how many of you can read lips?
No one?
O.K. Class dismissed.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Just testing.
Sit down.
Lydia and Tony, good lip readers.
Would you mind closing your notebook?
Thank you.
Now, give me one good reason why we should learn to speak.
Tony.
To pick up hearing girls.
To pick up hearing girls.
O.K. Let's work on this.
All right.
Now...
here.
You.
O.K. Here are two beautiful hearing girls.
You two guys want to pick them up.
What is the first thing you want to say, Danny?
Are you rich?
Are you r-i-i-ch?
Say it.
Rich.
Good.
Lydia.
I'm very rich.
Good.
Tony.
Let's go somewhere and do it.
No, thank you.
Let's go somewhere and do it-t.
I would rather do it with her.
Cute.
How about you guys?
You want to join us?
They don't talk.
Fair enough.
O.K. Reasons to talk.
Right.
If your hands are occupied.
For example, some guy owes you money.
He comes by,
How will you tell him to give you your money?
You can't use your hands.
You've got to speak.
Give me my money, you bum.
Call me names, will you?
I don't have to stand here and take that.
You want to fight, huh?
O.K. Put up your feet and fight like a man.
See?
[Crash]
Take your pots... and your lousy food and shove them...
Doesn't mince words, does she?
Mr. Leeds.
Oh, Leeds!
Leeds!
Join us.
Sure.
O.K.
Sorry.
Good thing you're out of my classroom.
Sit down, James.
Mary Lee Ochs, Assistant Superintendent.
Orin Dennis, math and social studies.
James Leeds.
Leeds.
Hi.
Did I hear Miss Ochs say you were one of her students?
Yes.
I started here at 5.
Really?
Wow, that's great.
I'm impressed.
For still being here?
Not what I meant.
See you all later.
Bye.
Who is that?
That's Sarah.
Never mind her.
She's a pain in the ass.
But who is she?
What does she do?
She works here.
Orin, I've got an idea.
How about the kids making potholders for parents' day?
They don't sell.
We've got hundreds left from last year.
We do?
Oh.
We do?
Oh.
Sarah came here at 5, too.
We grew up together.
Is she a teacher, too?
She was one of our brightest students.
Would you give me some of the water?
Thank you.
Leeds, you're a genius.
You will work.

A drip.
[Very Loud] Oh!
What a drip!
No.
No.
No!
No!
That's not what I meant.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm James Leeds.
It's Sarah, isn't it?
Would you like to sit down?
Right here.
O.K. We'll both stand up.
Oh, I see.
Very good.
You got me there.
Could you look at me, please?
If you don't look at me, I can't...
So, um...
Dr. Franklin tells me that you've been here since you were 5.
Mm-hmm.
Um... when did you graduate?
And, uh, now... now...
now you work here?
Are you reading my lips?
I don't think that you are reading my lips.
Ohhh...
Gee, that was quick of me, wasn't it?
You could've told me.
Why?
I don't know.
How about common courtesy?
How about me getting out of here so you can mop the floor?
Man... you know, if you let me,
I bet I could teach you how to speak.
And you could teach me... but I don't want to mop the floor.
Gee, that was quick.
And you don't want to speak.
Brilliant.
Schmuck.
It's a damn shame.
Costly, too.
Resodding is damn costly.
No.
I'm talking about Sarah Norman.
Right.
Sarah.
Look at this, will you?
What a mess.
Has she ever tried speaking?
Sarah's not hard of hearing.
She's totally deaf.
Born that way.
That makes it tough.
The rain's lousing up the fields.
It's a shame that a bright woman is stuck here cleaning toilets.
Doesn't bother her.
Oh, no?
Look, hotshot, not everyone wants to be a star.
Sarah is content.
She had a rotten childhood.
She was diagnosed as retarded until she was 7.
We let her know how smart she was.
For what?
She's productive.
Pays taxes.
Oh, brother.
All right.
You want to try?
I'll talk to her.
Huh?
I'll talk to her.
Look at this.
Will you look at this?
Damn!
It's going to cost $2,000 or $3,000 at least.
Oh, brother.
S-S-Sat.
Sat.
All right.
[Bell Rings]
That's good.
You have to work on S's, though.
O.K.?
Go.
Out.
James, Sarah has agreed to give you an hour.
She's really looking forward to it.
You're really looking forward to it, aren't you?
What did I tell you?
Well, uh...
have fun, Jim... as usual.
Well, Sarah, uh... yeah.
I do mind, actually.
Fire laws and all that, but you go right ahead.
Listen... how would you like to fake out Franklin, make me look real good?
I'm sorry.
I didn't get that.
Uh... if...
I... don't... sign... faster... the hour will be over before I finish my opening speech.
No.
I'm all out of jokes.
Good.
I'm not funny.
Oh, yeah?
If you could hear, you'd think I was a scream.
You're deaf?
Well, I'll try to remember that.
I'll forget?
No, I won't.
Listen, um... why don't we get this thing started here?
Well, thank you for stopping by.
The pleasure was mine.
God.
My mama.
Your mama.
Great.
Go.
Glen, who's your favorite person?
Twisted Sister?
It's the name of the rock group.
Oh.
Oh.
Try saying that.
Twisted Sister.
Glen, it takes courage.
I know.
Just give me one sound.
One. "T."
"T."
Try.
"T."
Tweeh...
That's great.
Yeah.
Out of here.
Go.
Great.
Johnny?
Who's your favorite person?
Princess Di?
Benji?
No.
Terminator?
Uh...
[Bell Rings]
Hey.
Hey, you want to play stand up, sit down again?
Whoa, careful, you almost smiled.
Ah, that's a girl.
That's the Sarah Norman we all know and love.
If my jokes are terrible and my signing is boring, what are you doing here?
There's a whole empty beach.
Unbelievable.
I tried to call your mother.
Hey.
Hold it.
Wait.
Wait.
I can't...
I didn't even talk to her.
O.K.?
I mean, can we stop this?
I mean, why can't we...
I mean, why can't we just... why don't we... why don't we... go out and have some dinner tonight?
Huh?
Just give me a yes or a no.
Yes?
Good.
I think.
O.K. Um...
I will meet you behind, uh... the girls' dormitory, 8:00.
I will whisper your name.
Hey!
I know that sign.
That's the first sign I ever learned.
It's in Italian.
Can I suggest something?
Will you give me a break?
My Italian is worse than my signing.
The veal piccata is very good.
Look.
I'm sorry.
V-E-A-L P-I-C-C-A-T-A.
I mean, you see, by the time I finish, they may be out of it.
It's veal.
It's, uh... sauteed in lemon and butter.
What's veal?
Uh...
God.
What the hell is veal?
Um...
Good evening.
Something to drink this evening?
You want something to drink, Sarah?
Our house wine is very nice.
You want some wine?
Yeah.
It's O.K.
Uh, white wine.
We'll take a carafe, please.
He doesn't think you're stupid.
He thinks you're deaf.
No.
Only stupid hearing people think that deaf people are stupid.
Do you really like being a cleaning woman?
Why?
Yeah.
I mean, there are other jobs where a person can work alone in silence.
Not with toilet bowl cleaner?
You should have told me that was the attraction.
You are smart as hell, you know?
You want to dance?
Can you feel it?
through your nose!

Mrs. Norman?
I'm James Leeds.
I didn't call again... because I would've hung up again.
It's 60 miles here and back.
Please, just five minutes.
I just got home from work.
This is my time to relax.
Discussing Sarah is hardly relaxing.
Five minutes.
Well.
Well.
Uh...
let's see.
You haven't seen Sarah in eight years?
Let's get this straight.
Sarah doesn't want to see me.
Has she said why?
We don't communicate very well.
Did you ever learn to sign?
Some of the parents...
I'm really sick of you people coming here every few years asking the same questions, blaming me.
God.
No one's blaming you.
Of course they are.
They can't blame themselves.
So, it's all my fault.
Fine.
I don't give a damn anymore.
I really just came to ask one question.
What happened when Sarah tried to speak?
What happened?
She looked awful.
She sounded awful.
People made fun of her.
What do you think?
Who made fun of her?
Other kids.
Her sister's friends.
Then she stopped trying to talk.
She's very pretty, you know.
Her sister Ruth had a bunch of boys hanging around, and they started asking Sarah out when she came home on weekends.
It was wonderful for her.
The boys really liked her.
They treated her just like they treated Ruth... with respect.
If you didn't know there was a problem, you would've thought she's perfectly normal.
Hi.
It's true.
I'm early today.
No.
Don't go.
I wanted to talk to you, anyway.
No.
I want to hel... work with you.
I understand that you're scared.
I understand nothing.
Sarah!
Come back here.
Sarah.
Yelling at the back of a deaf person.
Very good, James.
He's been at all the best schools.
Why did you stop going home?
Did your sister's friends, those boys that you were going out with, did they have anything to do with it?
Yes.
I talked to your mother.
Please, let me help you, damn it!
How?
By showing you the joys of sex with a hearing man?
I think that's one language you don't speak.
Yeah, O.K. I'm so...
Come on.
I can take it.
You have more than enough communication skills.
I don't.
They never did?
O.K.
[Stamps Floor]
Hey!
Who is they?
Hearing boys?
They could never be bothered to learn my language.
I was always expected to learn to speak.
Well, I don't speak.
Sex was always something I could do as well as hearing girls.
Better!
At first, I let them have me because they wanted to.
Before long, the boys were lined up on a waiting list my sister kept for me.
No introduction, no talk.
Just went to a dark place and...
They didn't even take me out for a Coke first.
That's not what I wanted to know about you.
I thought I was such a big deal... coming on to the deaf girl, giving her a thrill.
No, Sarah.
All the time, you were laughing at me.
I was thinking, "poor little deaf virgin who spread her legs for every..."
You think that I'm threatened by that?
You think that I give a good goddamn that you fucked every pimply-faced teenager?
I don't.
I don't give a shit!
Whoo.
Sarah, please listen to me.
I'm not going away.
I did the wrong thing.
I'm sorry.
I...
I don't know what to say.
Tell me what to say.
Sarah... you are the most mysterious, beautiful, angry person
I have ever met.
I am falling in lo...
Sarah...
Sarah...
I am falling... into the pool with you!
God!
What a fellow has to go through.

Good.
Good.
Glad to hear it.
We've got to have you to the house.
I'd like that.
I warn you, though...
I'm a poker player.
So I've heard.
Are you a card player?
No, not really.
Tic-tac-toe's my game.
So much the better, huh?
Well...
Thanks for coming in, Jim.
We're really happy to have you with us.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Oh, uh... your size?
Yeah.
Be careful, Jimbo.
Right.
Don't fight it.
Relax.
[Tango Music Plays]
Daphne.
Hmm?
You're leading again.
Sorry.
I got a funny sensation in my toes... like someone was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Let's throw another log on the fire.
[Tango Music Plays]
Ole!
[Jim] Ow!
Ow, ow, ow.
You are... the... nicest person...
I've... ever met.
Who, me?
I'm the nicest person you've ever met?
That's the craziest thing that I ever heard.
You thought after what you told me... that you'd never see me again?
Here I am.
Yeah, I was in love, but... she broke my heart.
Oh.
Yeah, I know.
Please don't break my heart.
Did anyone ever break yours?
You don't hurt from other people?
You never hurt from other people?
That's not true.
Sarah, I know people have hurt you.
I know.
Suppose you admitted that you hurt.
I'd... shrivel up and...
I'll take care of you, Sarah.
I'll take care of you.
What do you mean, that was my foul?
You moved into me.
You want to call me an asshole, say it.
No.
Say it out loud.
Watch my lips.
Asshole.
Ah-hole.
Ass... hole.
Ass-hole.
Great!
Asshole.
Good.
It was still your foul.
Asshole!
Did you know that waves strike the average beach about 750,000 times a day?
Wha...
That's true.
I just made it up.
You do?
What do waves sound like?
Whoo.
That is what they sound like.
How did you get to be so brilliant and beautiful?
And pigheaded.
You're the most stubborn person.
Yeah, you.
You're not stubborn?
O.K.
Hi, beautiful.
What am I saying?
Wait.
Sarah, that was a joke.
It wasn't funny.
O.K., I won't do it again.
I promise.
Sarah...
I promise.
Come on!
Mr. Harrison!
How are you?
Couldn't be better, Curtis.
Ah-ha.
Jim Harrison.
He donated the chemistry lab.
Your boy Glen is coming along.
He's a fine lad.
Has he changed that idiotic haircut?
No.
I like to give the kids a lot of leeway.
Asshole!

Look at those shingles.
Guess they'll all have to be replaced.

I don't know what made her upset.

She is not messed up.
I'm not discussing this.
Nobody's going to fuck with one of my students.
She's no student!
She's a 25-year-old woman!
Nobody's going to fuck with one of my employees.
It's going to stop!
She's quitting her job!
She's what?
She's quitting.
She's moving in with me!
Oh.
Oh, I see.
She's going to be your maid now, huh?
Jesus Christ, Franklin.
James, James...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That wasn't fair.
That wasn't fair to Sarah, either.
I've seen this kind of thing before.
It just doesn't work!
This isn't this kind of thing.
This is us.
This is Sarah and me.
I love her!
Sure, the kids made me happy.
Is that against the law?
I don't hate you for not learning how to speak.
Sarah...
Sarah, I...
Iove you.
I need you.
Where are your suitcases?
Aha!
[Stamps On Floor]
It's your suitcase.
You are moving in with me today.
Here.
I'm packing your clothes.
You'll need some clothes.
Now, it's your turn.
Screw your job.
I got mine.
You can do whatever you want.
Sarah... what do you want?
Me.
You got me.
What else?
Children.
You want... deaf children?
What do you want me to say, that I want deaf children?
No, I don't.
But if they were, that would be fine.
Ah.
Could you get me some more, too?
I don't think she heard me.
Mr. Leeds!
I don't think you're an asshole anymore.
No?
No.
I think you're a... dick-brain.
Dick-brain?
That's fantastic.
I got it right away.
Yeah, Dick-brain.

You ready?
No, Franklin will not expect you to speak.
My God, you look so gorgeous.
[Doorbell Rings]
I'll get it.
This is great.
I cannot believe this...
James.
And Sarah!
Oh, come in.
Come in, please.
Oh, Martha, Sarah's here, too.
You've taught her to play poker?
Not me.
She learned it out of a book.
Well, about that time.
Sarah knows how to play poker?
It's good to see you again.
You look... mmm!
Here.
Sit next to me.
No, no, no.
No couples together.
Let's break it up.
Come on, break it up.
Sarah... no cheating.
Don't start, Curtis.
I've seen deaf people cheat like bandits.
Come on.
Oh, yes.
Those little signs that no one will see.
Very funny, Franklin.
Don't pay attention to him.
With Jim, of course.
Together, you can clean up.
Jim won't cheat.
He's not deaf.
That's very good.
Very good, Sarah.
Very good.
High card deals.
9. 10.
You're high.
You deal.
Nickel, dime, and quarter.
All of them?
Yes.

One-eyed jacks wild.
One-eyed jacks wild?
One-eyed jacks.
O.K.
You're doing great with her, Jim.
Yeah, what a change.
Pretty impressive, James.
What about the poor guys that lost?
Want these here or in the kitchen?
No, I'll clean up.
It's no bother.
It's fine.
I can't believe how well she played.
There goes my mad money.
Great.
James... where can I get a copy of that book?
You are smart.
She bluffed me.
I folded with three of a kind.
Did you teach her that?
Quite a coup, James.
A lesson for us all.
Oh, God.
God, I can't ever get close enough.
Say my name.
Just once, say my name.
I'm sorry.
I need it...
I'm...
I know I promised.
I'm sorry.
I forgot.
I...
I'm not lying.
I don't want you to speak.
It just came out.
Please, it just...
I'm sorry.
Hike!
No.
No.
I don't care!
They killed my brother.
Don't kill him!
Don't shoot!
They'll shoot you, too!
Get out of my way!
Shoot please!
Do it for me!
[Gunshots]
Can we have some soda?
Yes.
[Telephone Rings]
The phone is ringing.
What?
The phone is ringing.
What phone?
The phone you can't hear because it's so noisy.
Turn that damn thing down.
Good grief.
What am I saying?
[Ring]
The phone is ringing.
The TV is blasting.
[Teakettle Whistles]
The kettle...
If someone would just fire a bazooka through the window.
[Gunshots]
Can you hold on?
That would be great.
Water's boiling.
Hello.
What?
Ask him to hang on for a second.
[Tires Squealing]
It's for you.
It's one of the dorm counselors.
He's translating a call from a deaf man.
It's Orin.
Lydia, Danny!
For god's sake...
It's over.
Bye.
Thank God for small favors.
O.K. You still there?
Great.
You both ready?
We're both ready.
This is Sarah speaking to Orin.
Hi.
Why are you calling?
I'm having a small dinner party.
I want you to come, please.
How about me, please?
Don't translate that to Orin.
Please.
No, I'm not saying please.
Wait a minute.
That was Orin saying please.
Look, it's my fault.
I probably sounded like myself instead of like the dorm counselor sounding like Orin.
He wants you to come to a party for...
Marian Loesser.
Please.
Great.
Um...
She is dying to see you.
Bring James!
Friday at 7:00.
O.K. Fine.
We'll be there.
Yeah.
Thank you.
My God.
Either I just went deaf, or it is suddenly quiet in here.
I do not make everything into a joke.
I possibly obscure...
How the hell would you sign "obscure"?
Obscure.
I'm going to rest my hands and my eyes and listen to 20 minutes of Bach.
You know...
I haven't turned on my hi-fi since you...
Hold it.
That sounds like... like I'm blaming you for me not listening to music.
Thank you.
I will.
I'll rest my hands... and listen to something beautiful.
[Bach Plays]
I can't enjoy it.
I can't, because you can't.
[Bach Plays]
Show you the music?
Let's see...
I can't.
Don't be sad for you.
All right, I won't.
What should you wear to the party?
I don't know.
Have I ever heard of who?
Oh, Marian.
She's the lady the party's for?
No.
Should I have?
She's very famous in the deaf community.
Nice catch.
She has two Ph.D. s, and she doesn't speak.
Take a look at these.
Hungry?
I can't communicate with someone when my mind is busy amusing itself.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
What do you hear?
I mean, is it just silence?
No one has ever gotten in there to find out?
Will you ever let me in?
She's something, isn't she?
Is she a lawyer or something?
Uh-uh.
An economist in Washington.
A real math whiz.
How thrilling.
Yeah.
It is.
I just feel like everyone is talking in some far northern Hungarian dialect over there.
I know the feeling.
Just because I wanted to leave, doesn't mean you wanted to leave.
All right.
Sarah, what the hell is wrong with you tonight?
I'll wait.
Sure.
Marian's great.
So what?
She has everything.
Education.
Great job.
Money.
Well, I'll tell you one thing that she has not got.
Me.
Oh, we're not talking about me for once.
That's true.
Hey...
Let's crawl under the covers, sweetheart, and pretend we're in some... romantic, distant place.
We're not.
We're here.
Right.
O.K.
Let's deal with it.
What is making you so miserable?
Oh...
Let's go to sleep?
No.
You can't start a bonfire and then say night-night.
And you can't start a bonfire and then run away, either.
Oh, you can do anything you want?
Yeah, like what?
Nothing.
I can do nothing.
I'm equipped for nothing and trained for nothing.
You feel like an idiot.
I treat you like an idiot?
I pity you?
Wait a second.
And now you see Marian...
What about Marian?
Let you be you?
I don't?
I want you to be a deaf person so I can change you into a hearing person?
I don't want to help anybody.
I just want to change and control...
Good night.
No... you think that I want you to speak.
And you just want to be you?
Well, who the hell are you?
Right.
[Stamps Floor]
What?
God, you want to make love now?
Fuck you, lady.
Oh, that's what you want.
You understood that.
That didn't help much.
Oh, it helped you?
Great.
That's really wonderful.
Makes me happy.
What a night.
I think that helped.
Yeah?
What have you just decided?
No one's ever going to speak for you again?
Come on.
How are you going to manage?
Everyone's always told me who I am, and I let them.
"She wants, she thinks."
And most of the time they were wrong.
They had no idea what I said, wanted, thought.
And now they won't.
Well, that's all right.
I'll buy that.
No, I won't.
How could I?
Because I love you.
Love has nothing to do with it?
That's wonderful.
Then what the hell have we been doing?
Watch your hands?
It's hard to avoid them.
This sign... to connect... simple.
But it means so much more when I do this.
Now it means... to be joined in a relationship.
Separate, but one.
That's what I want.
But you think for me, think for Sarah.
As though there were no "I."
She will be with me, quit her job, learn how to play poker, leave Orin's party, learn how to speak.
That's all you, not me.
Until you let me be an "I,"
the way you are, you can never come inside my silence and know me.
And I won't let myself know you.
Until that time... we can't be like this... joined.
Well... that's all very moving.
But... how are you going to manage?
You can lock yourself back in your precious silent castle...
I heard.
I heard every word, goddamn it.
I translated for myself.
It went from your hands into my brain and out my mouth.
And you know what?
I think you're lying.
I don't think that you think being deaf is so goddamn wonderful.
I think that you're scared to death to try.
I think it's nothing but stupid pride that's keeping you from speaking right.
You want to be on your own.
You don't want to be pitied.
Then you learn to read my lips and use your mouth for something besides showing me you're better than hearing girls in bed.
Read my lips.
What am I saying?
What am...
You want to talk to me, then you learn my language.
Did you understand that?
You've probably been reading lips for years.
But that's the great control game, isn't it?
I'm the controller?
What a fucking joke.
Now, come on!
Speak to me!
Speak!
Speak to me!
Aah!
See my mouth?
Aah!
Hear my voice?
Aah!
I'm not afraid!
Hot chocolate.
Your favorite.
Have you... come... home... to stay?
Of course you can.
As long as you like.
You need a job, but there's nothing.
I'll...
I'll...
I'll help.
I... never helped.
Don't... hurt me now.
The last time, you... we... sent you away because...
I didn't know... how to... take care of you.
Your father... couldn't accept you.
He felt... he'd failed.
You're right.
I hated you... for... driving him away.
Please... forgive me.
[Telephone Rings]
[Ring]
Telephone.
What...
What should I say?
[Ring]
[Ring]
[Ring]
Hello.
No...
I'm sorry, James.
No, she's not.
All right.
I'll call you if I see her.
[Bach Plays]
Favorite books.
Good.
Do you have any favorite books, Glen?
Yeah.
Skull?
I'll put that on my summer reading list.
I have to see her.
I know she doesn't want to see me.
She's made that very clear.
But I have to see her.
She'll let you know when she wants to see you.
She's working now.
She's saving her money.
She wants to go to college.
That's fine.
That's wonderful.
Um...
I've looked all over, Mrs. Norman.
Please.
Spring cleaning.
How was your day?
Are you O.K.?
No.
You're not fine.
You're lonely.
[Music Box Plays]
He was here.
He misses you.
You don't know what to do.
I think maybe you do.

You've been angry since you were a little girl.
You didn't want to hurt again, so you used your anger... to push me away.
You're sorry.
I'm sorry... for hurting you.
But you learned from me.
You learned that you can hurt... and you won't shrivel up and blow away.
I don't want to be without you, either.
Do you think... that we could find a place... where we can meet... not in silence... and not in sound?
[Waves Crashing]
This is the most amazing resume I've ever seen.
I've been with some really good schools.
The best.
All of them.
All of the best.
One right after another.
And you've also been with the lucky Erin bar and grill.
Pittsburgh.
Bartender.
And a disc jockey.
In Oklahoma.
I used to broadcast in sign language.
You've been all over the map.
I've got a lot of energy.
I'm sure you do have a lot of energy and a lot of new ideas.
I did, too, when...
But nobody's trying to change the world around here.
Just trying to help a few deaf kids get along a little better, that's all.
Everything else is razzle-dazzle.
Am I, uh...
Am I making myself clear?
Yes, I believe that you are.
Are we being punished?
Hi.
I'm James Leeds, and...
My signing is rusty, so how many of you can read lips?
No one?
OK.
Class dismissed.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Just testing.
Sit down.
Lydia and Tony, good lip readers.
Would you mind closing your notebook?
Thank you.
Now, give me one good reason why we should learn to speak.
Tony.
To pick up hearing girls.
To pick up hearing girls.
OK.
Let's work on this.
All right.
Now...
Here.
You.
You.
OK.
Here are two beautiful hearing girls.
You two guys want to pick them up.
What is the first thing you want to say, Danny?
Are you rich?
Are you r-i-i-ch?
Say it.
Rich.
Good.
Lydia.
I'm very rich.
Good.
Tony.
Let's go somewhere and do it.
No, thank you.
Let's go somewhere and do it-t.
I would rather do it with her.
Cute.
How about you guys?
You want to join us?
They don't talk.
Fair enough.
OK.
Reasons to talk.
Right.
If your hands are occupied.
For example, some guy owes you money.
He comes by, but you just happen to be in a handstand.
How will you tell him to give you your money?
You can't use your hands.
You've got to speak.
Give me my money, you bum.
Call me names, will you?
I don't have to stand here and take that.
You want to fight, huh?
OK.
Put up your feet and fight like a man.
See?
Take your pots...
And your lousy food and shove them...
Doesn't mince words, does she?
Mr. Leeds.
Mr. Leeds.
Oh, Leeds!
Leeds!
Join us.
Sure.
OK.
Sorry.
Good thing you're out of my classroom.
Sit down, James.
Mary Lee Ochs, assistant superintendent.
Orin Dennis, math and social studies.
James Leeds.
Leeds.
Hi.
Did I hear miss Ochs say you were one of her students?
Yes.
I started here at 5.
Really?
Wow, that's great.
I'm impressed.
For still being here?
Not what I meant.
See you all later.
Bye.
Who is that?
That's Sarah.
Never mind her.
She's a pain in the ass.
But who is she?
What does she do?
She works here.
Orin, I've got an idea.
How about the kids making potholders for parents' day?
They don't sell.
We've got hundreds left from last year.
We do?
Oh.
Sarah came here at 5, too.
We grew up together.
Is she a teacher, too?
She was one of our brightest students.
Would you give me some of the water?
Thank you.
Leeds, you're a genius.
You will work.
Ooh.
Yeah.
Mr. Bach.
Hear that...
Cat?
Ooh.
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang.
Again.
Faster.
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang.
One more time, faster.
Ba-boom-a-rang-rang-rang.
Great.
Right.
That is great.
Brilliant.
My Lydia.
Come here, Lydia.
OK.
Put your hands on the speaker.
Come on.
Feel that?
Good.
Feel it.

Oh!
What a drip!
No.
No.
No!
No!
That's not what I meant.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm James Leeds.
It's Sarah, isn't it?
Would you like to sit down?
Right here.
OK.
We'll both stand up.
Oh, I see.
Very good.
You got me there.
Could you look at me, please?
If you don't look at me, I can't...
So, um...
Dr. Franklin tells me that you've been here since you were 5.
Mm-hmm.
Um...
When did you graduate?
And, uh, now... now... now you work here?
Are you reading my lips?
I don't think that you are reading my lips.
Ohhh...
Gee, that was quick of me, wasn't it?
You could've told me.
Why?
I don't know.
How about common courtesy?
How about me getting out of here so you can mop the floor?
Man...
You know, if you let me,
I bet I could teach you how to speak.
And you could teach me...
But I don't want to mop the floor.
Gee, that was quick.
And you don't want to speak.
Brilliant.
Schmuck.
It's a damn shame.
Costly, too.
Resodding is damn costly.
No.
I'm talking about Sarah Norman.
Right.
Sarah.
Look at this, will you?
What a mess.
Has she ever tried speaking?
Sarah's not hard of hearing.
She's totally deaf.
Born that way.
That makes it tough.
The rain's lousing up the fields.
It's a shame that a bright woman is stuck here cleaning toilets.
Doesn't bother her.
Oh, no?
Look, hotshot, not everyone wants to be a star.
Sarah is content.
She had a rotten childhood.
She was diagnosed as retarded until she was 7.
We let her know how smart she was.
For what?
She's productive.
Pays taxes.
Oh, brother.
All right.
You want to try?
I'll talk to her.
Huh?
I'll talk to her.
Look at this.
Will you look at this?
Damn!
It's going to cost $2,000 or $3,000 at least.
Oh, brother.
S-s-sat.
Sat.
All right.
That's good.
You have to work on s's, though.
OK.?
Go.
Out.
James, Sarah has agreed to give you an hour.
She's really looking forward to it.
You're really looking forward to it, aren't you?
What did I tell you?
Well, uh...
Have fun, Jim...
As usual.
Well, Sarah, uh...
Yeah.
I do mind, actually.
Fire laws and all that, but you go right ahead.
Listen...
How would you like to fake out Franklin, make me look real good?
I'm sorry.
I didn't get that.
Uh...
If...
I...
Don't...
Sign...
Faster...
The hour will be over before I finish my opening speech.
No.
I'm all out of jokes.
Good.
I'm not funny.
Oh, yeah?
If you could hear, you'd think I was a scream.
You're deaf?
Well, I'll try to remember that.
I'll forget?
No, I won't.
Listen, um...
Why don't we get this thing started here?
Well, thank you for stopping by.
The pleasure was mine.
God.
My mama.
Your mama.
Great.
Go.
Glen, who's your favorite person?
Twisted sister?
Twisted sister?
It's the name of the rock group.
Oh.
Oh.
Try saying that.
Twisted sister.
Glen, it takes courage.
I know.
Just give me one sound.
One. "T."
"T."
Try.
"T."
"T."
Tweeh...
That's great.
That's great.
Yeah.
Out of here.
Go.
Great.
Johnny?
Who's your favorite person?
Princess Di?
Benji?
No.
Terminator?
Uh...
Hey.
Hey, you want to play stand up, sit down again?
Whoa, careful, you almost smiled.
Ah, that's a girl.
That's the Sarah Norman we all know and love.
If my jokes are terrible and my signing is boring, what are you doing here?
There's a whole empty beach.
Unbelievable.
I tried to call your mother.
Hey.
Hold it.
Wait.
Wait.
I can't...
I didn't even talk to her.
OK.?
I mean, can we stop this?
I mean, why can't we...
I mean, why can't we just...
Why don't we...
Why don't we...
Go out and have some dinner tonight?
Huh?
Just give me a yes or a no.
Yes?
Good.
I think.
OK.
Um...
I will meet you behind, uh...
The girls' dormitory, 8:00.
I will whisper your name.
Hey!
I know that sign.
That's the first sign I ever learned.
It's in Italian.
Can I suggest something?
Will you give me a break?
My Italian is worse than my signing.
The veal piccata is very good.
Look.
I'm sorry.
V-e-a-l p-i-c-c-a-t-a.
I mean, you see, by the time I finish, they may be out of it.
It's veal.
It's, uh...
Sauteed in lemon and butter.
What's veal?
Uh...
God.
What the hell is veal?
Um...
Good evening.
Something to drink this evening?
You want something to drink, Sarah?
Our house wine is very nice.
You want some wine?
Yeah.
It's OK.
Uh, white wine.
We'll take a carafe, please.
He doesn't think you're stupid.
He thinks you're deaf.
No.
Only stupid hearing people think that deaf people are stupid.
Do you really like being a cleaning woman?
Why?
Yeah.
I mean, there are other jobs where a person can work alone in silence.
Not with toilet bowl cleaner?
You should have told me that was the attraction.
You are smart as hell, you know?
You want to dance?
Can you feel it?
Vibrations...
Through your nose!

I am a really good teacher, though.
You...
You should let me help you.
What is that?
Lydia does not talk like that.
Don't you want to be able to get along in the world?
No one wants my help?
That's your opinion.
That's fine.
You don't do anything you can't do well?
♫ I don't want to stop now ♫
♫ oh
♫ oh, oh
♫ I've been loving you
♫ a little too long
♫ I don't want to stop... ♫♫
well, I would like to walk with you.
It's...
My pleasure.
Mrs. Norman?
I'm James Leeds.
I didn't call again...
Because I would've hung up again.
It's 60 Miles here and back.
Please, just five minutes.
I just got home from work.
This is my time to relax.
Discussing Sarah is hardly relaxing.
Five minutes.
Well.
Well.
Uh...
Let's see.
You haven't seen Sarah in eight years?
Let's get this straight.
Sarah doesn't want to see me.
Has she said why?
We don't communicate very well.
Did you ever learn to sign?
Some of the parents...
I'm really sick of you people coming here every few years asking the same questions, blaming me.
God.
No one's blaming you.
Of course they are.
They can't blame themselves.
So, it's all my fault.
Fine.
I don't give a damn anymore.
I really just came to ask one question.
What happened when Sarah tried to speak?
What happened?
She looked awful.
She sounded awful.
People made fun of her.
What do you think?
Who made fun of her?
Other kids.
Her sister's friends.
Then she stopped trying to talk.
She's very pretty, you know.
Her sister Ruth had a bunch of boys hanging around, and they started asking Sarah out when she came home on weekends.
It was wonderful for her.
The boys really liked her.
They treated her just like they treated Ruth... with respect.
If you didn't know there was a problem, you would've thought she's perfectly normal.
Hi.
It's true.
I'm early today.
No.
Don't go.
I wanted to talk to you, anyway.
No.
I want to hel...
Work with you.
I understand that you're scared.
I understand nothing.
Sarah!
Come back here.
Sarah.
Yelling at the back of a deaf person.
Very good, James.
He's been at all the best schools.
Why did you stop going home?
Did your sister's friends, those boys that you were going out with, did they have anything to do with it?
Yes.
I talked to your mother.
Please, let me help you, damn it!
How?
By showing you the joys of sex with a hearing man?
I think that's one language you don't speak.
Yeah, OK.
I'm so...
Come on.
I can take it.
You have more than enough communication skills.
I don't.
They never did?
OK.
Hey!
Who is they?
Hearing boys?
They could never be bothered to learn my language.
I was always expected to learn to speak.
Well, I don't speak.
Sex was always something I could do as well as hearing girls.
Better!
At first, I let them have me because they wanted to.
Before long, the boys were lined up on a waiting list my sister kept for me.
No introduction, no talk.
Just went to a dark place and...
They didn't even take me out for a coke first.
That's not what I wanted to know about you.
I thought I was such a big deal...
Coming on to the deaf girl, giving her a thrill.
No, Sarah.
All the time, you were laughing at me.
I was thinking, "poor little deaf virgin"
who spread her legs for every..."
you think that I'm threatened by that?
You think that I give a good goddamn that you fucked every pimply-faced teenager?
I don't.
I don't give a shit!
Whoo.
Sarah, please listen to me.
I'm not going away.
I did the wrong thing.
I'm sorry.
I...
I don't know what to say.
Tell me what to say.
Sarah...
You are the most mysterious, beautiful, angry person
I have ever met.
I am falling in lo...
Sarah...
Sarah...
I am falling...
Into the pool with you!
God!
What a fellow has to go through.
♫ my love will get ya

how are things going, Jim?
Great.
Just great.
Good.
Good.
Glad to hear it.
We've got to have you to the house.
I'd like that.
I warn you, though...
I'm a poker player.
So I've heard.
Are you a card player?
No, not really.
Tic-tac-toe's my game.
So much the better, huh?
Well...
Thanks for coming in, Jim.
We're really happy to have you with us.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Oh, uh...
Your size?
Yeah.
Be careful, Jimbo.
Right.
Don't fight it.
Relax.
Daphne.
Hmm?
You're leading again.
Sorry.
I got a funny sensation in my toes...
Like someone was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Let's throw another log on the fire.
Ole!
Ow!
Ow, ow, ow.
You are...
The...
Nicest person...
I've...
Ever met.
Who, me?
I'm the nicest person you've ever met?
That's the craziest thing that I ever heard.
You thought after what you told me...
That you'd never see me again?
Here I am.
Yeah, I was in love, but...
She broke my heart.
Oh.
Yeah, I know.
Please don't break my heart.
Did anyone ever break yours?
You don't hurt from other people?
You never hurt from other people?
That's not true.
Sarah, I know people have hurt you.
I know.
Suppose you admitted that you hurt.
I'd...
Shrivel up and...
I'll take care of you, Sarah.
I'll take care of you.
What do you mean, that was my foul?
You moved into me.
You want to call me an asshole, say it.
No.
Say it out loud.
Watch my lips.
Asshole.
Ah-hole.
Ass...
Hole.
Ass-hole.
Great!
Asshole.
Good.
It was still your foul.
Asshole!
Did you know that waves strike the average beach about 750,000 times a day?
Wha... that's true.
I just made it up.
You do?
What do waves sound like?
Whoo.
That is what they sound like.
How did you get to be so brilliant and beautiful?
And pigheaded.
You're the most stubborn person.
Yeah, you.
You're not stubborn?
OK.
Hi, beautiful.
What am I saying?
Wait.
Sarah, that was a joke.
It wasn't funny.
OK., I won't do it again.
I promise.
Sarah...
I promise.
Come on!
Mr. Harrison!
How are you?
Couldn't be better, Curtis.
Ah-ha.
Jim Harrison.
He donated the chemistry lab.
Your boy Glen is coming along.
He's a fine lad.
Has he changed that idiotic haircut?
No.
I like to give the kids a lot of leeway.
Asshole!
Shit for brains!
Look at those shingles.
Guess they'll all have to be replaced.
Thank you, Mr. Jones' class for your informative demonstration of the importance of the four food groups.
And now, Mr. Leeds' 11th grade speech and language class has a special treat for us.

where did they leave it?
In here.
Where in here?
What did they do?
Just a cut, huh?
It's five stitches, huh?
You stupid son of... she could have seriously hurt herself...
In front of a parent.
It's going to stop now.
What?
I don't know what made her upset.
You've got no right to mess her up!
She is not messed up.
I'm not discussing this.
Nobody's going to fuck with one of my students.
She's no student!
She's a 25-year-old woman!
Nobody's going to fuck with one of my employees.
It's going to stop!
She's quitting her job!
She's what?
She's quitting.
She's moving in with me!
Oh.
Oh, I see.
She's going to be your maid now, huh?
Jesus Christ, Franklin.
James, James...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That wasn't fair.
That wasn't fair to Sarah, either.
I've seen this kind of thing before.
It just doesn't work!
This isn't this kind of thing.
This is us.
This is Sarah and me.
I love her!
Sure, the kids made me happy.
Is that against the law?
I don't hate you for not learning how to speak.
Sarah...
Sarah, I...
Love you.
I need you.
Where are your suitcases?
Aha!
It's your suitcase.
You are moving in with me today.
Here.
I'm packing your clothes.
You'll need some clothes.
Now, it's your turn.
Screw your job.
I got mine.
You can do whatever you want.
Sarah...
What do you want?
Me.
You got me.
What else?
Children.
You want...
Deaf children?
What do you want me to say, that I want deaf children?
No, I don't.
But if they were, that would be fine.
Ah.
Could you get me some more, too?
I don't think she heard me.
Mr. Leeds!
I don't think you're an asshole anymore.
No?
No.
I think you're a...
Dick-brain.
Dick-brain?
That's fantastic.
I got it right away.
Yeah, dick-brain.
Really excellent.
Good work.
Choo Choo Choo Choo.
Choo Choo Choo Choo.
Machine, freeze.
Favorite candy, Tony.
Chunky.
Good.
Go.
Freeze.
Favorite animal, Lydia.
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Fine actor, fine actor.
Go!
Freeze.
Favorite football player...
Ooh.
Johnny.
Thank you, Johnny.
And favorite football hero, Cheryl.
Billy "White Shoes" Johnson.
Great choice.
Go.
You ready?
No, Franklin will not expect you to speak.
My God, you look so gorgeous.
I'll get it.
This is great.
I cannot believe this...
James.
And Sarah!
Oh, come in.
Come in, please.
Oh, Martha, Sarah's here, too.
You've taught her to play poker?
Not me.
She learned it out of a book.
Well, about that time.
Sarah knows how to play poker?
It's good to see you again.
You look...
Mmm!
Here.
Sit next to me.
No, no, no.
No couples together.
Let's break it up.
Come on, break it up.
Sarah...
No cheating.
Don't start, Curtis.
I've seen deaf people cheat like bandits.
Come on.
Oh, yes.
Those little signs that no one will see.
Very funny, Franklin.
Don't pay attention to him.
With Jim, of course.
Together, you can clean up.
Jim won't cheat.
He's not deaf.
That's very good.
Very good, Sarah.
Very good.
High card deals.
9. 10.
You're high.
You deal.
Nickel, dime, and quarter.
All of them?
Yes.
Ante up, everybody.
Out of a book, huh?
Five card draw.
One-eyed Jacks wild.
One-eyed Jacks wild?
One-eyed Jacks.
OK.
You're doing great with her, Jim.
Yeah, what a change.
Pretty impressive, James.
What about the poor guys that lost?
Want these here or in the kitchen?
No, I'll clean up.
It's no bother.
It's fine.
I can't believe how well she played.
There goes my mad money.
Great.
James...
Where can I get a copy of that book?
You are smart.
She bluffed me.
I folded with three of a kind.
Did you teach her that?
Quite a coup, James.
A lesson for us all.
Oh, God.
God, I can't ever get close enough.
Say my name.
Just once, say my name.
I'm sorry.
I need it...
I'm...
I know I promised.
I'm sorry.
I forgot.
I...
I'm not lying.
I don't want you to speak.
It just came out.
Please, it just...
I'm sorry.
Hike!
No.
No.
I don't care!
They killed my brother.
Don't kill him!
Don't shoot!
They'll shoot you, too!
Get out of my way!
Shoot please!
Do it for me!
Can we have some soda?
Yes.
The phone is ringing.
What?
The phone is ringing.
What phone?
The phone you can't hear because it's so noisy.
Turn that damn thing down.
Good grief.
What am I saying?
The phone is ringing.
The TV is blasting.
The kettle...
If someone would just fire a bazooka through the window.
Can you hold on?
That would be great.
Water's boiling.
Hello.
What?
Ask him to hang on for a second.
It's for you.
It's one of the dorm counselors.
He's translating a call from a deaf man.
It's Orin.
Lydia, Danny!
For God's sake... it's over.
Bye.
Thank God for small favors.
OK.
You still there?
Great.
You both ready?
We're both ready.
This is Sarah speaking to Orin.
Hi.
Why are you calling?
I'm having a small dinner party.
I want you to come, please.
How about me, please?
Don't translate that to Orin.
Please.
No, I'm not saying please.
Wait a minute.
That was Orin saying please.
Look, it's my fault.
I probably sounded like myself instead of like the dorm counselor sounding like Orin.
He wants you to come to a party for...
Marian Loesser.
Please.
Great.
Um...
She is dying to see you.
Bring James!
Friday at 7:00.
OK.
Fine.
We'll be there.
Yeah.
Thank you.
My God.
Either I just went deaf, or it is suddenly quiet in here.
I do not make everything into a joke.
I possibly obscure...
How the hell would you sign "obscure"?
Obscure.
I'm going to rest my hands and my eyes and listen to 20 minutes of Bach.
You know...
I haven't turned on my hi-fi since you...
Hold it.
That sounds like...
Like I'm blaming you for me not listening to music.
Thank you.
I will.
I'll rest my hands...
And listen to something beautiful.
I can't enjoy it.
I can't, because you can't.
Show you the music?
Let's see...
I can't.
Don't be sad for you.
All right, I won't.
What should you wear to the party?
I don't know.
Have I ever heard of who?
Oh, Marian.
She's the lady the party's for?
No.
Should I have?
She's very famous in the deaf community.
Nice catch.
She has two PhDs, and she doesn't speak.
Take a look at these.
Hungry?
I can't communicate with someone when my mind is busy amusing itself.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
What do you hear?
I mean, is it just silence?
No one has ever gotten in there to find out?
Will you ever let me in?
She's something, isn't she?
Is she a lawyer or something?
Uh-uh.
An economist in Washington.
A real math whiz.
How thrilling.
Yeah.
It is.
I just feel like everyone is talking in some far northern Hungarian dialect over there.
I know the feeling.
Just because I wanted to leave, doesn't mean you wanted to leave.
All right.
Sarah, what the hell is wrong with you tonight?
I'll wait.
Sure.
Marian's great.
So what?
She has everything.
Education.
Great job.
Money.
Well, I'll tell you one thing that she has not got.
Me.
Oh, we're not talking about me for once.
That's true.
Hey...
Let's crawl under the covers, sweetheart, and pretend we're in some...
Romantic, distant place.
We're not.
We're here.
Right.
OK.
Let's deal with it.
What is making you so miserable?
Oh...
Let's go to sleep?
No.
You can't start a bonfire and then say night-night.
And you can't start a bonfire and then run away, either.
Oh, you can do anything you want?
Yeah, like what?
Nothing.
I can do nothing.
I'm equipped for nothing and trained for nothing.
You feel like an idiot.
I treat you like an idiot?
I pity you?
Wait a second.
And now you see Marian...
What about Marian?
Let you be you?
I don't?
I want you to be a deaf person so I can change you into a hearing person?
I don't want to help anybody.
I just want to change and control... good night.
No...
You think that I want you to speak.
And you just want to be you?
Well, who the hell are you?
Right.
What?
God, you want to make love now?
Fuck you, lady.
Oh, that's what you want.
You understood that.
That didn't help much.
Oh, it helped you?
Great.
That's really wonderful.
Makes me happy.
What a night.
I think that helped.
Yeah?
What have you just decided?
No one's ever going to speak for you again?
Come on.
How are you going to manage?
Everyone's always told me who I am, and I let them.
"She wants, she thinks."
And most of the time they were wrong.
They had no idea what I said, wanted, thought.
And now they won't.
Well, that's all right.
I'll buy that.
No, I won't.
How could I?
Because I love you.
Love has nothing to do with it?
That's wonderful.
Then what the hell have we been doing?
Watch your hands?
It's hard to avoid them.
This sign...
To connect...
Simple.
But it means so much more when I do this.
Now it means...
To be joined in a relationship.
Separate, but one.
That's what I want.
But you think for me, think for Sarah.
As though there were no "I."
She will be with me, quit her job, learn how to play poker, leave Orin's party, learn how to speak.
That's all you, not me.
Until you let me be an "I,"
the way you are, you can never come inside my silence and know me.
And I won't let myself know you.
Until that time...
We can't be like this...
Joined.
Well...
That's all very moving.
But...
How are you going to manage?
You can lock yourself back in your precious silent castle...
I heard.
I heard every word, goddamn it.
I translated for myself.
It went from your hands into my brain and out my mouth.
And you know what?
I think you're lying.
I don't think that you think being deaf is so goddamn wonderful.
I think that you're scared to death to try.
I think it's nothing but stupid pride that's keeping you from speaking right.
You want to be on your own.
You don't want to be pitied.
Then you learn to read my lips and use your mouth for something besides showing me you're better than hearing girls in bed.
Read my lips.
What am I saying?
What am... you want to talk to me, then you learn my language.
Did you understand that?
You've probably been reading lips for years.
But that's the great control game, isn't it?
I'm the controller?
What a fucking joke.
Now, come on!
Speak to me!
Speak!
Speak to me!
Aah!
See my mouth?
Aah!
Hear my voice?
Aah!
Aah!
I'm not afraid!
Hot chocolate.
Your favorite.
Have you...
Come...
Home...
To stay?
Of course you can.
As long as you like.
You need a job, but there's nothing.
I'll...
I'll...
I'll help.
I...
Never helped.
Don't...
Hurt me now.
The last time, you...
We...
Sent you away because...
I didn't know...
How to...
Take care of you.
Your father...
Couldn't accept you.
He felt...
He'd failed.
You're right.
I hated you...
For...
Driving him away.
Please...
Forgive me.
Telephone.
What...
What should I say?
Hello.
No...
I'm sorry, James.
No, she's not.
All right.
I'll call you if I see her.
Favorite books.
Favorite books.
Good.
Do you have any favorite books, Glen?
Yeah.
Skull?
I'll put that on my summer reading list.
I have to see her.
I know she doesn't want to see me.
She's made that very clear.
But I have to see her.
She'll let you know when she wants to see you.
She's working now.
She's saving her money.
She wants to go to college.
That's fine.
That's wonderful.
Um...
I've looked all over, Mrs. Norman.
Please.
Spring cleaning.
How was your day?
Are you OK.?
No.
You're not fine.
You're lonely.
He was here.
He misses you.
You don't know what to do.
I think maybe you do.

You were scared, too.
I hear that boomerang song.
♫ ooh, my love can't catch ya ♫♫
you've been angry since you were a little girl.
You didn't want to hurt again, so you used your anger...
To push me away.
You're sorry.
I'm sorry...
For hurting you.
But you learned from me.
You learned that you can hurt...
And you won't shrivel up and blow away.
I don't want to be without you, either.
Do you think...
That we could find a place...
Where we can meet...
Not in silence...
And not in sound?
This is the most amazing I've ever seen.
- I've been with some good schools.
- All of them!
All of the best.
One right after another.
You've also been with the Lucky Erin Bar and Grill.
- Pittsburgh.
Bartender.
- And a disc jockey.
In Oklahoma.
I used to broadcast in sign language.
- You've covered the map, Mr Leeds.
- I've got a lot of energy.
I'm sure you do have energy and new ideas.
I did, too, when...
But nobody's trying to change the world here.
Just trying to help a few deaf kids get along a little better.
Everything else is razzle-dazzle.
Am I making myself clear?
Yes, I believe that you are.
Are we being punished?
Hi!
I'm James Leeds.
My signing is rusty, so how many of you can read lips?
No one?
OK.
Class dismissed.
No, no, no!
Just testing.
Sit down.
Lydia and Tony, good lip-readers.
Would you mind closing your notebook?
Thank you.
Give me one good reason why we should learn to speak?
- Tony.
- To pick up hearing girls.
To pick up hearing girls.
Let's work on this.
You, you, you.
Here are two beautiful hearing girls.
You two guys want to pick them up.
What is the first thing you want to say?
Danny.
- Are you rich?
- Are you ri-i-ich?
Say it.
- Rich.
- Good.
- Lydia?
- I'm very rich.
Good!
Tony?
Let's go somewhere and do it.
No, thank you.
- Let's go somewhere and do it.
- I'd rather do it with her.
Cute.
How about you guys?
Do you want to join us?
- They don't talk.
- Fair enough.
OK, reasons to talk.
Right.
If your hands are occupied.
For example.
Some guy owes you money.
He comes by.
But you just happen to be in a handstand.
How will you tell him to give you your money?
You can't use your hands.
You've got to speak.
"Give me my money, you bum."
"Don't call me names.
I don't have to take that.
Do you want to fight?"
"Put up your feet and fight like a man!"
See.
"Take your pots..."
"...and your lousy food, and shove..."
She doesn't mince words.
Mr Leeds!
Mr Leeds!
Leeds?
Leeds!
- Join us.
- Sir, OK.
Sorry.
- It's good you're out of my classroom.
- Sit down, James.
Mary Lee Ochs, Assistant Superintendent.
Orin Dennis, Math and Social Studies.
James Leeds.
Did I hear Miss Ochs say that you were one of her students?
- Yes.
I started here at five.
- Really?
- That's great.
I'm impressed.
- For still being here?
- No, what I meant...
- Excuse me.
See you all later.
Bye.
- Who is that?
- That's Sarah.
Never mind her.
She's a pain in the ass.
Always has been.
- What does she do?
- She works here.
Orin, how about the kids making pot-holders for Mother's Day?
But they don't sell.
We've got hundreds left from last year.
Sarah came here at five, too.
We grew up together.
Is she a teacher, too?
She was one of the brightest students we've ever had.
Some water, please.
Thank you.
Leeds, you're a genius.
You will work!
Ooh, yeah.
Mr Bach!
Hear that, cat?
Ba-boo-ma-rang-rang-rang.
- Again.
Faster.
- Ba-boo-ma-rang-rang-rang.
- Once more.
Faster.
- Ba-boo-ma-rang-rang-rang.
Great!
Great.
That's great.
Oh, Lydia, my Lydia.
Come here, Lydia.
Put your hands on the speaker.
Come on.
Can you feel that?
Good.
Feel it.
Like a boomerang, baby Like a boomerang-rang-rang
Two, three, four, ba-boo-ma-rang-rang-rang.
- Use your voice.
- Ba-boo-ma-rang-rang-rang.
A drip.
Drip.
What a drip!
Sorry.
No, no, no!
No, that's not what I meant.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm James Leeds.
It's Sarah, isn't it?
Would you like to sit down?
Right here.
OK, we'll both stand up.
Oh, I see.
Very good.
You got me there.
Look at me, please.
If you don't look at me, I can't...
So, Doctor Franklin tells me that you've been here since you were five.
When did you graduate?
And now you work here?
Are you reading my lips?
I don't think that you are reading my lips.
Gee, that was quick of me, wasn't it?
You could have told me.
Why?
How about common courtesy?
How about me leaving so you can mop the floor?
Man!
If you let me, I bet I could teach you how to speak.
And you could teach me...
But I don't want to mop the floor.
That was quick.
And you don't want to speak.
Brilliant.
Schmuck.
- It's a damn shame.
- Costly, too.
Re-sodding is damn costly.
- No, I'm talking about Sarah Norman.
- Right, Sarah.
- Look at this.
What a mess!
- Has she ever tried to use her voice?
Sarah's not hard-of-hearing.
She was born totally deaf.
- Yeah, that makes it tough.
- The rain is lousing up the fields.
It's a shame that a bright woman is cleaning toilets.
It doesn't bother her.
Look, hotshot, not everyone wants to be a star.
Sarah is content.
She had a rotten time as a kid.
She was diagnosed as retarded until she was seven.
We educated her.
- For what?
- She's productive, pays taxes.
If you want to try, I'll talk to her.
I'll talk to her.
Look at this, will you?
Damn!
- This will cost 2-3,000 dollars.
- Oh, brother!
- Sat.
- Sat.
All right!
That's really good.
You have to work on the "S's", though.
Go.
Out.
James?
Sarah has agreed to give you an hour, and she's looking forward to it.
You're looking forward to it, aren't you, Sarah?
What did I tell you?
Well, have fun, Jim.
As usual.
Well, Sarah...
Yeah, I do mind actually.
Fire laws and all that.
But you go right ahead.
Listen...
How would you like to fake out Franklin?
Make me look real good?
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.
If I don't sign faster, the hour will be over before I finish my opening speech.
No, I'm all out of jokes.
Good.
I'm not funny.
Oh, yeah?
If you could hear, you'd think I was a scream.
You're deaf.
I'll try to remember that.
I'll forget.
No, I won't.
Listen, why don't we get this thing started?
Well, thank you for stopping by.
Pleasure...was mine.
God.
- My mama.
- Your mama.
Great, go.
Glen, who is your favourite person?
- Twisted Sister?
The Twisted Sister?
- It's the name of a rock group.
Try saying that.
Twisted Sister.
Glen, it takes courage.
I know.
Just give me one sound.
One "T".
Try! "T".
That's great, great.
Yeah, out of here.
Go.
Great!
Johnny?
Who's your favourite person?
Princess Di?
Benji?
Terminator?
Hey!
Do you want to play "stand up, sit down" again?
Careful, you almost smiled.
That's the girl!
That's the Sarah Norman we all know and love.
If my jokes are terrible, and my signing is boring, what are you doing here?
There's a whole empty beach!
Unbelievable.
I tried to call your mother.
Hold it, hold it.
Come on, wait, wait!
I can't...
I didn't even talk to her.
OK?
Can we stop this?
I mean, why can't we...
I mean, why can't we just...
Why don't we...
Why don't we go out and have dinner tonight?
Just give me a "yes" or a "no".
Yes.
Good.
I think.
OK.
I will meet you behind the girls' dormitory, 8 o'clock.
I will whisper your name.
Hey!
I know that sign.
That's the first sign I ever learned!
It's in Italian.
Can I suggest something?
Will you give me a break?
My Italian is worse than my signing.
The Veal Piccata is very good.
Look.
I'm sorry.
V-E-A-L P-l-C-C-A-T-A.
You see, by the time I finish, they may be out of it.
It's veal.
It's saut¨¦ed in lemon and butter.
What's veal?
God.
What the hell is veal?
Good evening.
Something to drink this evening?
Do you want something to drink?
- Our house wine is very nice.
- Wine?
Yeah, it's OK.
White wine.
I'll take a carafe, please.
He doesn't think you're stupid.
He thinks you're deaf.
No, only stupid hearing people think that deaf people are stupid.
Do you really like being a cleaning woman?
Why?
Yeah, but there are other jobs where people can work alone in silence.
Not with toilet bowl cleaner.
You should have told me that was the attraction.
You're smart as hell!
You want to dance?
Can you feel it?
Vibrations through your nose!
I'm not good at this.
And you are.
Great.
I don't know why I became a speech teacher.
OK?
Let's dance.
It's too hard to dance and talk.
Well, maybe I like to hear myself talk.
I am a really good teacher.
You should let me help you.
What is that?
Lydia does not talk like that.
Don't you want to get along in the world?
No one wants my help.
That's your opinion.
Fine.
You don't do anything you can't do well.
Well, I would like to walk with you.
It's...
My pleasure.
Mrs Norman?
I'm James Leeds.
I didn't call again, because...
-...
I would have hung up again.
- It's 60 miles here and back.
- Please, just five minutes.
- I just got home from work.
This is my time to relax.
Discussing Sarah is hardly relaxing.
Five minutes.
Well?
Well, you haven't seen Sarah in eight years?
Sarah doesn't want to see me.
- Has she said why?
- We don't communicate very well.
Did you ever learn to sign?
Some of the parents...
I'm sick of you people coming every two years, asking the same questions.
- Blaming me.
- No one's blaming you.
Of course they are.
They can't blame themselves, so it's my fault.
Fine.
I don't give a damn any more.
I came to ask you one question.
What happened when Sarah tried to speak?
What happened?
She looked awful.
She sounded awful.
- People made fun of her.
- Who made fun of her?
Other kids.
Her sister's friends.
Then she stopped trying to talk.
She's very pretty, you know.
Her sister Ruth had boys hanging around, and they started asking Sarah out when she came home on weekends.
It was wonderful for her.
Boys really liked her.
They treated her just like they treated Ruth.
With respect.
If you didn't know there was a problem, you'd have thought she was normal.
Hi!
It's true, I'm early today.
No, don't go.
I wanted to talk to you anyway.
No, I want to work with you.
I understand that you're scared.
I understand nothing.
Sarah, come back here.
Sarah...
Yelling at the back of a deaf person.
Very good.
He's been to all the best schools.
Why did you stop going home?
Did your sister's friends, those boys you were going out with, have anything to do with it?
Yes, I talked to your mother.
Please let me help you, damn it!
How?
By showing you the joys of sex with a hearing man.
I think that that is one language that you don't speak!
Yeah, I'm so...
Come on, I can take it.
You have enough communication skills.
I don't.
They never did?
Hey!
Who is "they"?
Hearing boys.
They wouldn't try to learn my language.
I was expected to learn to speak.
Well, I don't speak.
Sex was something I could do as well as hearing girls.
Better.
At first, I let them have me because they wanted to.
Before long the boys were lined up on a waiting list my sister kept for me.
No introduction, no talk.
We just went to a dark place and...
They didn't even take me out for a Coke first.
No, that is not what I wanted to know about you.
I thought I was such a big deal, coming on to the deaf girl, giving her a thrill.
No!
And all the time you were laughing at me.
I was thinking, "Poor little deaf virgin, who'll spread her legs for every..."
Do you think I'm threatened by that?
Do you think I give a goddamn that you fucked every pimply-faced teenager?
I don't.
I don't give a shit!
Sarah, please listen to me.
I'm not going away.
I did the wrong thing.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.
Tell me what to say.
Sarah you are the most mysterious, beautiful, angry person I have ever met.
I'm falling in lo...
Sarah?
Sarah, I am falling into the pool with you!
God, what a fellow has to go through.
- How are things going?
- Great.
Good!
Glad to hear it.
- We must have you over soon.
- I'd like that.
- I warn you, I'm a keen poker player.
- So I've heard.
- Are you a card player?
- Not really.
Tic-tac-toe is my game.
So much the better?
Well, thanks for coming in, Jim.
We really are happy to have you with us.
Thank you.
- Your size?
- Yeah.
- Be careful, Jimbo.
- Right.
Don't fight it.
Relax.
Daphne, you're leading again.
I've got a funny sensation in my toes.
Like someone was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Let's put another log on that fire.
You are the nicest person
I've ever met.
Who, me?
I'm the nicest person you ever met?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard.
You thought that after what you told me, that you'd never see me again.
Here I am.
Yeah, I was in love, but she broke my heart.
God, no!
Please don't break my heart.
Did anyone ever break yours?
You never hurt from other people?
That's not true.
Sarah, I know people have hurt you.
I know.
Suppose you admitted that you hurt.
I'd shrivel up and...
I'll take care of you, Sarah.
I'll take care of you.
What do you mean that was my foul?
You moved into me.
You want to call me an asshole?
Say it!
Say it out loud.
Watch my lips.
Asshole.
- Ahole.
- Asshole.
- Asshole.
- Great!
- Asshole!
- Good.
It was still your foul.
Asshole!
Did you know that waves strike the average beach about 750,000 times a day?
That's true.
I just made it up.
You do?
What do waves sound like?
That is what they sound like.
How did you get to be so brilliant and beautiful?
And pig-headed?
You're the most stubborn person.
You.
You're not stubborn?
OK.
Hi, beautiful.
What am I saying?
Wait.
That was a joke.
It wasn't funny.
OK, I won't do it again.
I promise.
Sarah...
I promise.
Mr Harrison!
How are you?
Couldn't be better, Curtis.
She's doing wonderfully.
Jim Harrison.
He donated the chemistry lab.
- Glen is really coming along.
A fine lad.
- Get him to change that idiotic hair cut?
No, I like to give the kids leeway.
- Asshole!
Shit-for-brains!
- Look at those shingles.
They'll have to be replaced.
Thank you, Mr Jones' class, for your demonstration of the four food groups.
And now, Mr Leeds' 1 1th-grade speech and language class has a treat for us.
Glen is singing!
- It's a stupid song, but he's singing.
- He's wonderful!
- I'm very impressed, Doctor.
- Anything that works, Edward.
Just a cut?
It's five stitches.
You stupid son-of-a...
She could've seriously hurt herself.
In front of a parent, too.
It's going to stop!
- I don't know what made her so upset.
- I'm not letting you mess her up!
- She's not messed up.
- I don't want to discuss this.
- Nobody fucks with my students.
- She's a 25-year-old woman!
Nor with my employees.
It's going to stop!
- She's quitting.
- What?
She's quitting her job.
She's moving in with me.
I see, she's going to be your maid now.
- Jesus Christ, Franklin.
- James, James!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, that wasn't fair.
Not to Sarah, either.
- This kind of thing just doesn't work!
- It's not like that.
This is us.
This is Sarah and me!
I love her!
Sure, the kids made me happy.
Is that against the law?
I don't hate you for not learning how to speak.
Sarah.
I love you.
I need you.
Where are your suitcases?
It's your suitcase.
You are moving in with me today.
Here.
I'm packing your clothes.
You'll need some clothes.
Now it's your turn.
Screw your job.
I've got mine.
You can do whatever you want.
Sarah, what do you want?
Me?
You've got me.
What else?
Children.
You want deaf children?
What do you want me to say?
That I want deaf children?
No, I don't.
But if they were, that would be fine.
Could you get me some more, too?
I don't think she heard me.
Mr Leeds!
I don't think you're an asshole any more.
No.
I think you're a dick-brain.
A dick-brain?
That's fantastic.
I got it right away.
- Yeah.
Dick-brain!
- Excellent.
Good work!
Freeze!
- Favourite candy, Tony?
- Chunky.
Good.
Go!
- Freeze!
Favourite animal, Lydia?
- Arnold Schwarzenegger.
A fine actor.
Go!
Freeze!
Favourite football player.
Johnny?
Thank you, Johnny.
And favourite football hero.
- Cheryl?
- Billy "White Shoes" Johnston.
Great choice.
Go!
Are you ready?
No, Franklin will not expect you to speak.
My God, you look so gorgeous.
I'll get it.
That must be James.
James?
And Sarah!
Come in, please.
Martha, Sarah's here, too.
- Did you teach her how to play poker?
- No, she learned it out of a book.
About that time.
Sarah, it's good to see you again.
You look...!
Here.
Right next to me.
No, no, no.
No couples together.
Come on, let's break it up.
Sarah, no cheating.
Don't start.
I've seen deaf people cheat like bandits.
Oh, yes.
Those little signs that no one will see.
- Very funny, Franklin.
- Don't listen to him.
With Jim, of course!
Together you can clean up.
Jim won't cheat.
He's not deaf.
That's very good!
Very good, Sarah.
High card deals.
- Nine.
- Ten.
You're high, you deal.
- A nickel, dime and quarter.
- All of them?
Yes.
Ante up, everybody.
Out of a book?
Five card draw.
One-eyed Jacks wild.
One-eyed Jacks wild?
- You're doing great with her.
- Yeah, what a change.
Pretty impressive, James.
What about the poor guys who lost?
- You want these here or in the kitchen?
- No, I'll clean up.
I can't believe how well she played.
There goes my mad money.
James?
Where can I get a copy of that book?
You are smart.
She bluffed me.
I had three of a kind, and I folded.
Did you teach her that?
Quite a coup, James.
A lesson for us all.
God.
I can't ever get close enough.
Say my name.
Just once, say my name.
No, no, I'm sorry.
I needed...
I know I promised.
I'm sorry.
I forgot.
I'm not lying.
I don't want you to speak.
It just came out, Sarah!
I'm sorry.
Hike!
No.
No!
- Can we have some soda?
- Yes.
- The phone is ringing.
- What?
- The phone.
- What phone?
The phone you can't hear because it's so noisy in here.
Turn it down.
Good grief!
What?
The phone is ringing, the TV is blasting.
The kettle.
Now, if someone would just fire a bazooka through the window.
Could you hold on?
Water's boiling.
Hello.
What?
Can you ask him to hang on for a second?
It's for you.
It's one of the dorm counsellors.
She's translating a call from Deaf Man.
It's Orin.
Lydia, Danny, for God's sake!
- Over.
Bye.
- Thank God for small favours.
Are you still there?
Are you both ready?
We're both ready.
This is Sarah speaking to Orin.
Hi!
Why are you calling?
I'm having a small dinner party.
I want you to come, please.
How about me, please?
Don't translate that to Orin.
Please.
No, I'm not saying please.
Wait a minute.
That was Orin saying please.
It's my fault.
I probably sounded like myself instead of like the dorm counsellor sounding like Orin.
Anyway, he wants you to come to a party for Marian Loesser.
Please.
Great.
She is dying to see you.
Bring James!
Friday, at seven.
OK, fine, we'll be there.
Yeah.
Thank you.
My God!
Either I just went deaf, or it is suddenly quiet in here.
I do not make everything into a joke.
I possibly obscure.
How the hell would you sign "obscure"?
Obscure.
I'm going to rest my hands and my eyes, and listen to 20 minutes of Bach.
You know, I haven't turned on my hi-fi since you...
Hold it.
That sounds like I'm blaming you for me not listening to music.
Thank you.
I will rest my hands and listen to something beautiful.
I can't enjoy it.
I can't because you can't.
Show you the music?
I can't.
Don't be sad for you.
All right, I won't.
What should you wear to the party?
I don't know.
Have I ever heard of who?
Marian, the lady the party's for?
No.
Should I have?
She's very famous in the deaf community.
Nice catch!
She has two PhDs, and she doesn't speak.
- Take a look at these.
- Hungry?
I can't communicate when my mind is amusing itself.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
What do you hear?
I mean, is it just silence?
No one has ever gotten in there to find out.
Will you ever let me in?
- She's something, isn't she?
- Is she a lawyer or something?
An economist in Washington.
A real math whiz!
- How thrilling.
- Yeah, it is.
I feel like everyone is talking in some foreign northern Hungarian dialect.
I know the feeling.
Just because I wanted to leave, doesn't mean that you wanted to leave.
All right.
Sarah, what the hell is wrong with you tonight?
I'll wait.
Sure, Marian's great.
So what?
She has an education, great job, money.
Well, I'll tell you one thing that she has not got: me!
We're not talking about me, for once.
That's true.
Let's crawl under the covers, sweetheart, and pretend we're in some romantic, distant place.
We're not, we're here.
Right.
OK.
Let's deal with it.
What is making you so miserable?
Let's go to sleep?
!
No!
You can't start a bonfire and then say night-night.
And you can't start a bonfire and then run away either.
You can do anything you want.
Yeah, like what?
Nothing.
I can do nothing.
I'm equipped for nothing, trained for nothing.
You feel like an idiot.
I treat you like an idiot.
I pity you.
Wait a second!
And now you see Marian.
What about Marian?
Let you be you.
I don't?
I want you to be deaf so I can change you into a hearing person?
!
I don't want to help anybody.
I want to change them and contro...
Goodnight.
No.
You think that I want you to speak.
And you just want to be you.
Well, who the hell are you?
Right.
What?
You want to make love now?
Fuck you, lady!
Oh, that's what you want.
You understood that.
Then do it.
That didn't help much.
It helped you.
Great!
That's really wonderful.
Makes me happy.
What a night.
I think that helped.
Yeah?
What have you just decided?
No one's ever going to speak for you again.
Come on!
How are you going to manage?
Everyone's always told me who I am, and I let them. "She wants, she thinks."
Usually they were wrong.
They had no idea what I said, wanted, thought.
And now they will.
That's all right.
I'll buy that.
No, I won't.
How could I?
Because I love you.
Love has nothing to do with it?
!
That's wonderful.
Then what the hell have we been doing?
Watch your hands.
It's hard to avoid them.
This sign, to connect, simple.
But it means so much more when I do this.
Now it means to be joined in a relationship, separate but one.
That's what I want.
But you think for me, think for Sarah, as though there were no l.
She will be with me.
Quit her job, learn how to play poker,
leave Orin's party, learn how to speak.
That's all you, not me.
Until you let me be an l, the way you are, you can never come inside my silence and know me.
And I won't let myself know you.
Until that time, we can't be like this.
Joined.
Well, that's all very moving but how are you going to manage?
You can lock yourself back in your precious silent castle.
I heard.
I heard every word, goddamit!
I translated for myself.
It went from your hands, into my brain and out my mouth.
And you know what?
I think you are lying.
I don't think that you think being deaf is so goddamn wonderful.
I think that you're scared to try.
I think that it's nothing but stupid pride that's keeping you from speaking right!
You want to be on your own.
You don't want to be pitied.
Then you learn to read my lips, and use that little mouth for something besides showing me that you're better than hearing girls in bed.
Read my lips.
What am I saying?
What...
You want to talk to me, then you learn my language!
Did you understand that?
You've probably been reading lips for years, but that's the control game.
I'm the controller.
What a fucking joke!
Now, come on.
Speak to me.
Speak!
Speak to me!
Hear my voice!
I'm such a freak!
Hot chocolate.
Your favourite.
Have you come home to stay?
Of course you can.
As long as you like.
Me...need a job, but there's nothing.
I'll help.
I never helped.
Don't hurt me now.
The last time you...
We sent you away, because I didn't know how to take care of you.
Your father couldn't accept you.
He felt he'd failed.
You're right.
I hated you for driving him away.
Please forgive me.
Telephone.
What do I say?
Hello.
No.
I'm sorry, James.
No, she's not.
All right, I'll tell her that if I see her.
- Favourite books.
- Favourite books.
Good.
Do you have any favourite books, Glen?
"Skull".
I'll put that on my summer reading list.
I have to see her.
- I know she doesn't want to see me.
- She's made that clear.
But I have to see her.
She'll let you know when she wants to see you.
She's working now.
She's saving her money.
She wants to go to college.
That's fine.
That's wonderful.
I've looked all over, Mrs Norman.
Please?
Spring-cleaning.
How was your day?
Are you OK?
No.
You're not fine.
You're lonely.
He was here.
He misses you.
You don't know what to do.
I think maybe you do.
Have a good summer, William.
Language skills can be dangerous.
Use a little common sense, OK?
I will, Mr Leeds.
So long, William.
So long, fuck-face!
You look beautiful.
You wanted to see me.
It was a shock seeing you in there.
I didn't know what to do.
You were scared, too.
I hear that "Boomerang" song.
"Oh, my love can't catch ya."
You've been angry since you were a little girl.
You didn't want to hurt again, so you used your anger to push me away.
You're sorry.
I'm sorry for hurting you.
But you learned from me.
You learned that you can hurt.
And you won't shrivel up and blow away.
Come on.
I don't want to be without you, either.
Do you think that we could find a place where we can meet?
Not in silence, and not in sound.
" Children.of.a.Lesser.God. " The End
This is the most amazing I've ever seen.
- I've been with some good schools.
- All of them!
All of the best.
One right after another.
You've also been with the Lucky Erin Bar and Grill.
- Pittsburgh.
Bartender.
- And a disc jockey.
In Oklahoma.
I used to broadcast in sign language.
- You've covered the map, Mr Leeds.
- I've got a lot of energy.
I'm sure you do have energy and new ideas.
I did, too, when...
But nobody's trying to change the world here.
Just trying to help a few deaf kids get along a little better.
Everything else is razzle-dazzle.
Am I making myself clear?
Yes, I believe that you are.
Are we being punished?
Hi!
I'm James Leeds.
My signing is rusty, so how many of you can read lips?
No one?
OK.
Class dismissed.
No, no, no!
Just testing.
Sit down.
Lydia and Tony, good lip-readers.
Would you mind closing your notebook?
Thank you.
Give me one good reason why we should learn to speak?
- Tony.
- To pick up hearing girls.
To pick up hearing girls.
Let's work on this.
You, you, you.
Here are two beautiful hearing girls.
You two guys want to pick them up.
What is the first thing you want to say?
Danny.
- Are you rich?
- Are you ri-i-ich?
Say it.
- Rich.
- Good.
- Lydia?
- I'm very rich.
Good!
Tony?
Let's go somewhere and do it.
No, thank you.
- Let's go somewhere and do it.
- I'd rather do it with her.
Cute.
How about you guys?
Do you want to join us?
- They don't talk.
- Fair enough.
OK, reasons to talk.
Right.
If your hands are occupied.
For example.
Some guy owes you money.
He comes by.
But you just happen to be in a handstand.
How will you tell him to give you your money?
You can't use your hands.
You've got to speak.
"Give me my money, you bum."
"Don't call me names.
I don't have to take that.
Do you want to fight?"
"Put up your feet and fight like a man!"
See.
"Take your pots..."
"...and your lousy food, and shove..."
She doesn't mince words.
Mr Leeds!
Mr Leeds!
Leeds?
Leeds!
- Join us.
- Sir, OK.
Sorry.
- It's good you're out of my classroom.
- Sit down, James.
Mary Lee Ochs, Assistant Superintendent.
Orin Dennis, Math and Social Studies.
James Leeds.
Did I hear Miss Ochs say that you were one of her students?
- Yes.
I started here at five.
- Really?
- That's great.
I'm impressed.
- For still being here?
- No, what I meant...
- Excuse me.
See you all later.
Bye.
- Who is that?
- That's Sarah.
Never mind her.
She's a pain in the ass.
Always has been.
- What does she do?
- She works here.
Orin, how about the kids making pot-holders for Mother's Day?
But they don't sell.
We've got hundreds left from last year.
Sarah came here at five, too.
We grew up together.
Is she a teacher, too?
She was one of the brightest students we've ever had.
Some water, please.
Thank you.
Leeds, you're a genius.
You will work!
Ooh, yeah.
Mr Bach!
Hear that, cat?
Ba-boo-ma-rang-rang-rang.
- Again.
Faster.
- Ba-boo-ma-rang-rang-rang.
- Once more.
Faster.
- Ba-boo-ma-rang-rang-rang.
Great!
Great.
That's great.
Oh, Lydia, my Lydia.
Come here, Lydia.
Put your hands on the speaker.
Come on.
Can you feel that?
Good.
Feel it.
Like a boomerang, baby Like a boomerang-rang-rang
Two, three, four, ba-boo-ma-rang-rang-rang.
- Use your voice.
- Ba-boo-ma-rang-rang-rang.
A drip.
Drip.
What a drip!
Sorry.
No, no, no!
No, that's not what I meant.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm James Leeds.
It's Sarah, isn't it?
Would you like to sit down?
Right here.
OK, we'll both stand up.
Oh, I see.
Very good.
You got me there.
Look at me, please.
If you don't look at me, I can't...
So, Doctor Franklin tells me that you've been here since you were five.
When did you graduate?
And now you work here?
Are you reading my lips?
I don't think that you are reading my lips.
Gee, that was quick of me, wasn't it?
You could have told me.
Why?
How about common courtesy?
How about me leaving so you can mop the floor?
Man!
If you let me, I bet I could teach you how to speak.
And you could teach me...
But I don't want to mop the floor.
That was quick.
And you don't want to speak.
Brilliant.
Schmuck.
- It's a damn shame.
- Costly, too.
Re-sodding is damn costly.
- No, I'm talking about Sarah Norman.
- Right, Sarah.
- Look at this.
What a mess!
- Has she ever tried to use her voice?
Sarah's not hard-of-hearing.
She was born totally deaf.
- Yeah, that makes it tough.
- The rain is lousing up the fields.
It's a shame that a bright woman is cleaning toilets.
It doesn't bother her.
Look, hotshot, not everyone wants to be a star.
Sarah is content.
She had a rotten time as a kid.
She was diagnosed as retarded until she was seven.
We educated her.
- For what?
- She's productive, pays taxes.
If you want to try, I'll talk to her.
I'll talk to her.
Look at this, will you?
Damn!
- This will cost 2-3,000 dollars.
- Oh, brother!
- Sat.
- Sat.
All right!
That's really good.
You have to work on the "S's", though.
Go.
Out.
James?
Sarah has agreed to give you an hour, and she's looking forward to it.
You're looking forward to it, aren't you, Sarah?
What did I tell you?
Well, have fun, Jim.
As usual.
Well, Sarah...
Yeah, I do mind actually.
Fire laws and all that.
But you go right ahead.
Listen...
How would you like to fake out Franklin?
Make me look real good?
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.
If I don't sign faster, the hour will be over before I finish my opening speech.
No, I'm all out of jokes.
Good.
I'm not funny.
Oh, yeah?
If you could hear, you'd think I was a scream.
You're deaf.
I'll try to remember that.
I'll forget.
No, I won't.
Listen, why don't we get this thing started?
Well, thank you for stopping by.
Pleasure...was mine.
God.
- My mama.
- Your mama.
Great, go.
Glen, who is your favourite person?
- Twisted Sister?
The Twisted Sister?
- It's the name of a rock group.
Try saying that.
Twisted Sister.
Glen, it takes courage.
I know.
Just give me one sound.
One "T".
Try! "T".
That's great, great.
Yeah, out of here.
Go.
Great!
Johnny?
Who's your favourite person?
Princess Di?
Benji?
Terminator?
Hey!
Do you want to play "stand up, sit down" again?
Careful, you almost smiled.
That's the girl!
That's the Sarah Norman we all know and love.
If my jokes are terrible, and my signing is boring, what are you doing here?
There's a whole empty beach!
Unbelievable.
I tried to call your mother.
Hold it, hold it.
Come on, wait, wait!
I can't...
I didn't even talk to her.
OK?
Can we stop this?
I mean, why can't we...
I mean, why can't we just...
Why don't we...
Why don't we go out and have dinner tonight?
Just give me a "yes" or a "no".
Yes.
Good.
I think.
OK.
I will meet you behind the girls' dormitory, 8 o'clock.
I will whisper your name.
Hey!
I know that sign.
That's the first sign I ever learned!
It's in Italian.
Can I suggest something?
Will you give me a break?
My Italian is worse than my signing.
The Veal Piccata is very good.
Look.
I'm sorry.
V-E-A-L P-l-C-C-A-T-A.
You see, by the time I finish, they may be out of it.
It's veal.
It's saut¨¦ed in lemon and butter.
What's veal?
God.
What the hell is veal?
Good evening.
Something to drink this evening?
Do you want something to drink?
- Our house wine is very nice.
- Wine?
Yeah, it's OK.
White wine.
I'll take a carafe, please.
He doesn't think you're stupid.
He thinks you're deaf.
No, only stupid hearing people think that deaf people are stupid.
Do you really like being a cleaning woman?
Why?
Yeah, but there are other jobs where people can work alone in silence.
Not with toilet bowl cleaner.
You should have told me that was the attraction.
You're smart as hell!
You want to dance?
Can you feel it?
Vibrations through your nose!
I'm not good at this.
And you are.
Great.
I don't know why I became a speech teacher.
OK?
Let's dance.
It's too hard to dance and talk.
Well, maybe I like to hear myself talk.
I am a really good teacher.
You should let me help you.
What is that?
Lydia does not talk like that.
Don't you want to get along in the world?
No one wants my help.
That's your opinion.
Fine.
You don't do anything you can't do well.
Well, I would like to walk with you.
It's...
My pleasure.
Mrs Norman?
I'm James Leeds.
I didn't call again, because...
-...
I would have hung up again.
- It's 60 miles here and back.
- Please, just five minutes.
- I just got home from work.
This is my time to relax.
Discussing Sarah is hardly relaxing.
Five minutes.
Well?
Well, you haven't seen Sarah in eight years?
Sarah doesn't want to see me.
- Has she said why?
- We don't communicate very well.
Did you ever learn to sign?
Some of the parents...
I'm sick of you people coming every two years, asking the same questions.
- Blaming me.
- No one's blaming you.
Of course they are.
They can't blame themselves, so it's my fault.
Fine.
I don't give a damn any more.
I came to ask you one question.
What happened when Sarah tried to speak?
What happened?
She looked awful.
She sounded awful.
- People made fun of her.
- Who made fun of her?
Other kids.
Her sister's friends.
Then she stopped trying to talk.
She's very pretty, you know.
Her sister Ruth had boys hanging around, and they started asking Sarah out when she came home on weekends.
It was wonderful for her.
Boys really liked her.
They treated her just like they treated Ruth.
With respect.
If you didn't know there was a problem, you'd have thought she was normal.
Hi!
It's true, I'm early today.
No, don't go.
I wanted to talk to you anyway.
No, I want to work with you.
I understand that you're scared.
I understand nothing.
Sarah, come back here.
Sarah...
Yelling at the back of a deaf person.
Very good.
He's been to all the best schools.
Why did you stop going home?
Did your sister's friends, those boys you were going out with, have anything to do with it?
Yes, I talked to your mother.
Please let me help you, damn it!
How?
By showing you the joys of sex with a hearing man.
I think that that is one language that you don't speak!
Yeah, I'm so...
Come on, I can take it.
You have enough communication skills.
I don't.
They never did?
Hey!
Who is "they"?
Hearing boys.
They wouldn't try to learn my language.
I was expected to learn to speak.
Well, I don't speak.
Sex was something I could do as well as hearing girls.
Better.
At first, I let them have me because they wanted to.
Before long the boys were lined up on a waiting list my sister kept for me.
No introduction, no talk.
We just went to a dark place and...
They didn't even take me out for a Coke first.
No, that is not what I wanted to know about you.
I thought I was such a big deal, coming on to the deaf girl, giving her a thrill.
No!
And all the time you were laughing at me.
I was thinking, "Poor little deaf virgin, who'll spread her legs for every..."
Do you think I'm threatened by that?
Do you think I give a goddamn that you fucked every pimply-faced teenager?
I don't.
I don't give a shit!
Sarah, please listen to me.
I'm not going away.
I did the wrong thing.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.
Tell me what to say.
Sarah you are the most mysterious, beautiful, angry person I have ever met.
I'm falling in lo...
Sarah?
Sarah, I am falling into the pool with you!
God, what a fellow has to go through.
- How are things going?
- Great.
Good!
Glad to hear it.
- We must have you over soon.
- I'd like that.
- I warn you, I'm a keen poker player.
- So I've heard.
- Are you a card player?
- Not really.
Tic-tac-toe is my game.
So much the better?
Well, thanks for coming in, Jim.
We really are happy to have you with us.
Thank you.
- Your size?
- Yeah.
- Be careful, Jimbo.
- Right.
Don't fight it.
Relax.
Daphne, you're leading again.
I've got a funny sensation in my toes.
Like someone was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Let's put another log on that fire.
You are the nicest person
I've ever met.
Who, me?
I'm the nicest person you ever met?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard.
You thought that after what you told me, that you'd never see me again.
Here I am.
Yeah, I was in love, but she broke my heart.
God, no!
Please don't break my heart.
Did anyone ever break yours?
You never hurt from other people?
That's not true.
Sarah, I know people have hurt you.
I know.
Suppose you admitted that you hurt.
I'd shrivel up and...
I'll take care of you, Sarah.
I'll take care of you.
What do you mean that was my foul?
You moved into me.
You want to call me an asshole?
Say it!
Say it out loud.
Watch my lips.
Asshole.
- Ahole.
- Asshole.
- Asshole.
- Great!
- Asshole!
- Good.
It was still your foul.
Asshole!
Did you know that waves strike the average beach about 750,000 times a day?
That's true.
I just made it up.
You do?
What do waves sound like?
That is what they sound like.
How did you get to be so brilliant and beautiful?
And pig-headed?
You're the most stubborn person.
You.
You're not stubborn?
OK.
Hi, beautiful.
What am I saying?
Wait.
That was a joke.
It wasn't funny.
OK, I won't do it again.
I promise.
Sarah...
I promise.
Mr Harrison!
How are you?
Couldn't be better, Curtis.
She's doing wonderfully.
Jim Harrison.
He donated the chemistry lab.
- Glen is really coming along.
A fine lad.
- Get him to change that idiotic hair cut?
No, I like to give the kids leeway.
- Asshole!
Shit-for-brains!
- Look at those shingles.
They'll have to be replaced.
Thank you, Mr Jones' class, for your demonstration of the four food groups.
And now, Mr Leeds' 1 1th-grade speech and language class has a treat for us.
Glen is singing!
- It's a stupid song, but he's singing.
- He's wonderful!
- I'm very impressed, Doctor.
- Anything that works, Edward.
Just a cut?
It's five stitches.
You stupid son-of-a...
She could've seriously hurt herself.
In front of a parent, too.
It's going to stop!
- I don't know what made her so upset.
- I'm not letting you mess her up!
- She's not messed up.
- I don't want to discuss this.
- Nobody fucks with my students.
- She's a 25-year-old woman!
Nor with my employees.
It's going to stop!
- She's quitting.
- What?
She's quitting her job.
She's moving in with me.
I see, she's going to be your maid now.
- Jesus Christ, Franklin.
- James, James!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, that wasn't fair.
Not to Sarah, either.
- This kind of thing just doesn't work!
- It's not like that.
This is us.
This is Sarah and me!
I love her!
Sure, the kids made me happy.
Is that against the law?
I don't hate you for not learning how to speak.
Sarah.
I love you.
I need you.
Where are your suitcases?
It's your suitcase.
You are moving in with me today.
Here.
I'm packing your clothes.
You'll need some clothes.
Now it's your turn.
Screw your job.
I've got mine.
You can do whatever you want.
Sarah, what do you want?
Me?
You've got me.
What else?
Children.
You want deaf children?
What do you want me to say?
That I want deaf children?
No, I don't.
But if they were, that would be fine.
Could you get me some more, too?
I don't think she heard me.
Mr Leeds!
I don't think you're an asshole any more.
No.
I think you're a dick-brain.
A dick-brain?
That's fantastic.
I got it right away.
- Yeah.
Dick-brain!
- Excellent.
Good work!
Freeze!
- Favourite candy, Tony?
- Chunky.
Good.
Go!
- Freeze!
Favourite animal, Lydia?
- Arnold Schwarzenegger.
A fine actor.
Go!
Freeze!
Favourite football player.
Johnny?
Thank you, Johnny.
And favourite football hero.
- Cheryl?
- Billy "White Shoes" Johnston.
Great choice.
Go!
Are you ready?
No, Franklin will not expect you to speak.
My God, you look so gorgeous.
I'll get it.
That must be James.
James?
And Sarah!
Come in, please.
Martha, Sarah's here, too.
- Did you teach her how to play poker?
- No, she learned it out of a book.
About that time.
Sarah, it's good to see you again.
You look...!
Here.
Right next to me.
No, no, no.
No couples together.
Come on, let's break it up.
Sarah, no cheating.
Don't start.
I've seen deaf people cheat like bandits.
Oh, yes.
Those little signs that no one will see.
- Very funny, Franklin.
- Don't listen to him.
With Jim, of course!
Together you can clean up.
Jim won't cheat.
He's not deaf.
That's very good!
Very good, Sarah.
High card deals.
- Nine.
- Ten.
You're high, you deal.
- A nickel, dime and quarter.
- All of them?
Yes.
Ante up, everybody.
Out of a book?
Five card draw.
One-eyed Jacks wild.
One-eyed Jacks wild?
- You're doing great with her.
- Yeah, what a change.
Pretty impressive, James.
What about the poor guys who lost?
- You want these here or in the kitchen?
- No, I'll clean up.
I can't believe how well she played.
There goes my mad money.
James?
Where can I get a copy of that book?
You are smart.
She bluffed me.
I had three of a kind, and I folded.
Did you teach her that?
Quite a coup, James.
A lesson for us all.
God.
I can't ever get close enough.
Say my name.
Just once, say my name.
No, no, I'm sorry.
I needed...
I know I promised.
I'm sorry.
I forgot.
I'm not lying.
I don't want you to speak.
It just came out, Sarah!
I'm sorry.
Hike!
No.
No!
- Can we have some soda?
- Yes.
- The phone is ringing.
- What?
- The phone.
- What phone?
The phone you can't hear because it's so noisy in here.
Turn it down.
Good grief!
What?
The phone is ringing, the TV is blasting.
The kettle.
Now, if someone would just fire a bazooka through the window.
Could you hold on?
Water's boiling.
Hello.
What?
Can you ask him to hang on for a second?
It's for you.
It's one of the dorm counsellors.
She's translating a call from Deaf Man.
It's Orin.
Lydia, Danny, for God's sake!
- Over.
Bye.
- Thank God for small favours.
Are you still there?
Are you both ready?
We're both ready.
This is Sarah speaking to Orin.
Hi!
Why are you calling?
I'm having a small dinner party.
I want you to come, please.
How about me, please?
Don't translate that to Orin.
Please.
No, I'm not saying please.
Wait a minute.
That was Orin saying please.
It's my fault.
I probably sounded like myself instead of like the dorm counsellor sounding like Orin.
Anyway, he wants you to come to a party for Marian Loesser.
Please.
Great.
She is dying to see you.
Bring James!
Friday, at seven.
OK, fine, we'll be there.
Yeah.
Thank you.
My God!
Either I just went deaf, or it is suddenly quiet in here.
I do not make everything into a joke.
I possibly obscure.
How the hell would you sign "obscure"?
Obscure.
I'm going to rest my hands and my eyes, and listen to 20 minutes of Bach.
You know, I haven't turned on my hi-fi since you...
Hold it.
That sounds like I'm blaming you for me not listening to music.
Thank you.
I will rest my hands and listen to something beautiful.
I can't enjoy it.
I can't because you can't.
Show you the music?
I can't.
Don't be sad for you.
All right, I won't.
What should you wear to the party?
I don't know.
Have I ever heard of who?
Marian, the lady the party's for?
No.
Should I have?
She's very famous in the deaf community.
Nice catch!
She has two PhDs, and she doesn't speak.
- Take a look at these.
- Hungry?
I can't communicate when my mind is amusing itself.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
What do you hear?
I mean, is it just silence?
No one has ever gotten in there to find out.
Will you ever let me in?
- She's something, isn't she?
- Is she a lawyer or something?
An economist in Washington.
A real math whiz!
- How thrilling.
- Yeah, it is.
I feel like everyone is talking in some foreign northern Hungarian dialect.
I know the feeling.
Just because I wanted to leave, doesn't mean that you wanted to leave.
All right.
Sarah, what the hell is wrong with you tonight?
I'll wait.
Sure, Marian's great.
So what?
She has an education, great job, money.
Well, I'll tell you one thing that she has not got: me!
We're not talking about me, for once.
That's true.
Let's crawl under the covers, sweetheart, and pretend we're in some romantic, distant place.
We're not, we're here.
Right.
OK.
Let's deal with it.
What is making you so miserable?
Let's go to sleep?
!
No!
You can't start a bonfire and then say night-night.
And you can't start a bonfire and then run away either.
You can do anything you want.
Yeah, like what?
Nothing.
I can do nothing.
I'm equipped for nothing, trained for nothing.
You feel like an idiot.
I treat you like an idiot.
I pity you.
Wait a second!
And now you see Marian.
What about Marian?
Let you be you.
I don't?
I want you to be deaf so I can change you into a hearing person?
!
I don't want to help anybody.
I want to change them and contro...
Goodnight.
No.
You think that I want you to speak.
And you just want to be you.
Well, who the hell are you?
Right.
What?
You want to make love now?
Fuck you, lady!
Oh, that's what you want.
You understood that.
Then do it.
That didn't help much.
It helped you.
Great!
That's really wonderful.
Makes me happy.
What a night.
I think that helped.
Yeah?
What have you just decided?
No one's ever going to speak for you again.
Come on!
How are you going to manage?
Everyone's always told me who I am, and I let them. "She wants, she thinks."
Usually they were wrong.
They had no idea what I said, wanted, thought.
And now they will.
That's all right.
I'll buy that.
No, I won't.
How could I?
Because I love you.
Love has nothing to do with it?
!
That's wonderful.
Then what the hell have we been doing?
Watch your hands.
It's hard to avoid them.
This sign, to connect, simple.
But it means so much more when I do this.
Now it means to be joined in a relationship, separate but one.
That's what I want.
But you think for me, think for Sarah, as though there were no l.
She will be with me.
Quit her job, learn how to play poker,
leave Orin's party, learn how to speak.
That's all you, not me.
Until you let me be an l, the way you are, you can never come inside my silence and know me.
And I won't let myself know you.
Until that time, we can't be like this.
Joined.
Well, that's all very moving but how are you going to manage?
You can lock yourself back in your precious silent castle.
I heard.
I heard every word, goddamit!
I translated for myself.
It went from your hands, into my brain and out my mouth.
And you know what?
I think you are lying.
I don't think that you think being deaf is so goddamn wonderful.
I think that you're scared to try.
I think that it's nothing but stupid pride that's keeping you from speaking right!
You want to be on your own.
You don't want to be pitied.
Then you learn to read my lips, and use that little mouth for something besides showing me that you're better than hearing girls in bed.
Read my lips.
What am I saying?
What...
You want to talk to me, then you learn my language!
Did you understand that?
You've probably been reading lips for years, but that's the control game.
I'm the controller.
What a fucking joke!
Now, come on.
Speak to me.
Speak!
Speak to me!
Hear my voice!
I'm such a freak!
Hot chocolate.
Your favourite.
Have you come home to stay?
Of course you can.
As long as you like.
Me...need a job, but there's nothing.
I'll help.
I never helped.
Don't hurt me now.
The last time you...
We sent you away, because I didn't know how to take care of you.
Your father couldn't accept you.
He felt he'd failed.
You're right.
I hated you for driving him away.
Please forgive me.
Telephone.
What do I say?
Hello.
No.
I'm sorry, James.
No, she's not.
All right, I'll tell her that if I see her.
- Favourite books.
- Favourite books.
Good.
Do you have any favourite books, Glen?
"Skull".
I'll put that on my summer reading list.
I have to see her.
- I know she doesn't want to see me.
- She's made that clear.
But I have to see her.
She'll let you know when she wants to see you.
She's working now.
She's saving her money.
She wants to go to college.
That's fine.
That's wonderful.
I've looked all over, Mrs Norman.
Please?
Spring-cleaning.
How was your day?
Are you OK?
No.
You're not fine.
You're lonely.
He was here.
He misses you.
You don't know what to do.
I think maybe you do.
Have a good summer, William.
Language skills can be dangerous.
Use a little common sense, OK?
I will, Mr Leeds.
So long, William.
So long, fuck-face!
You look beautiful.
You wanted to see me.
It was a shock seeing you in there.
I didn't know what to do.
You were scared, too.
I hear that "Boomerang" song.
"Oh, my love can't catch ya."
You've been angry since you were a little girl.
You didn't want to hurt again, so you used your anger to push me away.
You're sorry.
I'm sorry for hurting you.
But you learned from me.
You learned that you can hurt.
And you won't shrivel up and blow away.
Come on.
I don't want to be without you, either.
Do you think that we could find a place where we can meet?
Not in silence, and not in sound.
[Bell Rings]
This is the most amazing resume I've ever seen.
I've been with some really good schools.
The best.
All of them.
All of the best.
One right after another.
And you've also been with the Lucky Erin Bar and Grill.
Pittsburgh.
Bartender.
And a disc jockey.
In Oklahoma.
I used to broadcast in sign language.
You've been all over the map.
I've got a lot of energy.
I'm sure you do have a lot of energy and a lot of new ideas.
I did, too, when...
But nobody's trying to change the world around here.
Just trying to help a few deaf kids get along a little better, that's all.
Everything else is razzle-dazzle.
Am I, uh... am I making myself clear?
Yes, I believe that you are.
[Buzzing]
Are we being punished?
Hi.
I'm James Leeds, and... my signing is rusty, so how many of you can read lips?
No one?
O.K. Class dismissed.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Just testing.
Sit down.
Lydia and Tony, good lip readers.
Would you mind closing your notebook?
Thank you.
Now, give me one good reason why we should learn to speak.
Tony.
To pick up hearing girls.
To pick up hearing girls.
O.K. Let's work on this.
All right.
Now...
here.
You.
You.
O.K. Here are two beautiful hearing girls.
You two guys want to pick them up.
What is the first thing you want to say, Danny?
Are you rich?
Are you r-i-i-ch?
Say it.
Rich.
Good.
Lydia.
I'm very rich.
Good.
Tony.
Let's go somewhere and do it.
No, thank you.
Let's go somewhere and do it-t.
I would rather do it with her.
Cute.
How about you guys?
You want to join us?
They don't talk.
Fair enough.
O.K. Reasons to talk.
Right.
If your hands are occupied.
For example, some guy owes you money.
He comes by, but you just happen to be in a handstand.
How will you tell him to give you your money?
You can't use your hands.
You've got to speak.
Give me my money, you bum.
Call me names, will you?
I don't have to stand here and take that.
You want to fight, huh?
O.K. Put up your feet and fight like a man.
See?
[Crash]
Take your pots... and your lousy food and shove them...
Doesn't mince words, does she?
Mr. Leeds.
Mr. Leeds.
Oh, Leeds!
Leeds!
Join us.
Sure.
O.K.
Sorry.
Good thing you're out of my classroom.
Sit down, James.
Mary Lee Ochs, Assistant Superintendent.
Orin Dennis, math and social studies.
James Leeds.
Leeds.
Hi.
Did I hear Miss Ochs say you were one of her students?
Yes.
I started here at 5.
Really?
Wow, that's great.
I'm impressed.
For still being here?
Not what I meant.
See you all later.
Bye.
Who is that?
That's Sarah.
Never mind her.
She's a pain in the ass.
But who is she?
What does she do?
She works here.
Orin, I've got an idea.
How about the kids making potholders for parents' day?
They don't sell.
We've got hundreds left from last year.
We do?
Oh.
We do?
Oh.
Sarah came here at 5, too.
We grew up together.
Is she a teacher, too?
She was one of our brightest students.
Would you give me some of the water?
Thank you.
Leeds, you're a genius.
You will work.
[Classical Music Plays]
Ooh.
Yeah.
Mr. Bach.
Hear that... cat?

A drip.
[Very Loud] Oh!
What a drip!
No.
No.
No!
No!
That's not what I meant.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm James Leeds.
It's Sarah, isn't it?
Would you like to sit down?
Right here.
O.K. We'll both stand up.
Oh, I see.
Very good.
You got me there.
Could you look at me, please?
If you don't look at me, I can't...
So, um...
Dr. Franklin tells me that you've been here since you were 5.
Mm-hmm.
Um... when did you graduate?
And, uh, now... now...
now you work here?
Are you reading my lips?
I don't think that you are reading my lips.
Ohhh...
Gee, that was quick of me, wasn't it?
You could've told me.
Why?
I don't know.
How about common courtesy?
How about me getting out of here so you can mop the floor?
Man... you know, if you let me,
I bet I could teach you how to speak.
And you could teach me... but I don't want to mop the floor.
Gee, that was quick.
And you don't want to speak.
Brilliant.
Schmuck.
It's a damn shame.
Costly, too.
Resodding is damn costly.
No.
I'm talking about Sarah Norman.
Right.
Sarah.
Look at this, will you?
What a mess.
Has she ever tried speaking?
Sarah's not hard of hearing.
She's totally deaf.
Born that way.
That makes it tough.
The rain's lousing up the fields.
It's a shame that a bright woman is stuck here cleaning toilets.
Doesn't bother her.
Oh, no?
Look, hotshot, not everyone wants to be a star.
Sarah is content.
She had a rotten childhood.
She was diagnosed as retarded until she was 7.
We let her know how smart she was.
For what?
She's productive.
Pays taxes.
Oh, brother.
All right.
You want to try?
I'll talk to her.
Huh?
I'll talk to her.
Look at this.
Will you look at this?
Damn!
It's going to cost $2,000 or $3,000 at least.
Oh, brother.
S-S-Sat.
Sat.
All right.
[Bell Rings]
That's good.
You have to work on S's, though.
O.K.?
Go.
Out.
James, Sarah has agreed to give you an hour.
She's really looking forward to it.
You're really looking forward to it, aren't you?
What did I tell you?
Well, uh...
have fun, Jim... as usual.
Well, Sarah, uh... yeah.
I do mind, actually.
Fire laws and all that, but you go right ahead.
Listen... how would you like to fake out Franklin, make me look real good?
I'm sorry.
I didn't get that.
Uh... if...
I... don't... sign... faster... the hour will be over before I finish my opening speech.
No.
I'm all out of jokes.
Good.
I'm not funny.
Oh, yeah?
If you could hear, you'd think I was a scream.
You're deaf?
Well, I'll try to remember that.
I'll forget?
No, I won't.
Listen, um... why don't we get this thing started here?
Well, thank you for stopping by.
The pleasure was mine.
God.
My mama.
Your mama.
Great.
Go.
Glen, who's your favorite person?
Twisted Sister?
Twisted Sister?
It's the name of the rock group.
Oh.
Oh.
Try saying that.
Twisted Sister.
Glen, it takes courage.
I know.
Just give me one sound.
One. "T."
"T."
Try.
"T."
"T."
Tweeh...
That's great.
That's great.
Yeah.
Out of here.
Go.
Great.
Johnny?
Who's your favorite person?
Princess Di?
Benji?
No.
Terminator?
Uh...
[Bell Rings]
Hey.
Hey, you want to play stand up, sit down again?
Whoa, careful, you almost smiled.
Ah, that's a girl.
That's the Sarah Norman we all know and love.
If my jokes are terrible and my signing is boring, what are you doing here?
There's a whole empty beach.
Unbelievable.
I tried to call your mother.
Hey.
Hold it.
Wait.
Wait.
I can't...
I didn't even talk to her.
O.K.?
I mean, can we stop this?
I mean, why can't we...
I mean, why can't we just... why don't we... why don't we... go out and have some dinner tonight?
Huh?
Just give me a yes or a no.
Yes?
Good.
I think.
O.K. Um...
I will meet you behind, uh... the girls' dormitory, 8:00.
I will whisper your name.
Hey!
I know that sign.
That's the first sign I ever learned.
It's in Italian.
Can I suggest something?
Will you give me a break?
My Italian is worse than my signing.
The veal piccata is very good.
Look.
I'm sorry.
V-E-A-L P-I-C-C-A-T-A.
I mean, you see, by the time I finish, they may be out of it.
It's veal.
It's, uh... sauteed in lemon and butter.
What's veal?
Uh...
God.
What the hell is veal?
Um...
Good evening.
Something to drink this evening?
You want something to drink, Sarah?
Our house wine is very nice.
You want some wine?
Yeah.
It's O.K.
Uh, white wine.
We'll take a carafe, please.
He doesn't think you're stupid.
He thinks you're deaf.
No.
Only stupid hearing people think that deaf people are stupid.
Do you really like being a cleaning woman?
Why?
Yeah.
I mean, there are other jobs where a person can work alone in silence.
Not with toilet bowl cleaner?
You should have told me that was the attraction.
You are smart as hell, you know?
You want to dance?
Can you feel it?
Vibrations... through your nose!

You should let me help you.
What is that?
Lydia does not talk like that.
Don't you want to be able to get along in the world?
No one wants my help?
That's your opinion.
That's fine.
You don't do anything you can't do well?

Well, I would like to walk with you.
It's... my pleasure.
Mrs. Norman?
I'm James Leeds.
I didn't call again... because I would've hung up again.
It's 60 miles here and back.
Please, just five minutes.
I just got home from work.
This is my time to relax.
Discussing Sarah is hardly relaxing.
Five minutes.
Well.
Well.
Uh...
let's see.
You haven't seen Sarah in eight years?
Let's get this straight.
Sarah doesn't want to see me.
Has she said why?
We don't communicate very well.
Did you ever learn to sign?
Some of the parents...
I'm really sick of you people coming here every few years asking the same questions, blaming me.
God.
No one's blaming you.
Of course they are.
They can't blame themselves.
So, it's all my fault.
Fine.
I don't give a damn anymore.
I really just came to ask one question.
What happened when Sarah tried to speak?
What happened?
She looked awful.
She sounded awful.
People made fun of her.
What do you think?
Who made fun of her?
Other kids.
Her sister's friends.
Then she stopped trying to talk.
She's very pretty, you know.
Her sister Ruth had a bunch of boys hanging around, and they started asking Sarah out when she came home on weekends.
It was wonderful for her.
The boys really liked her.
They treated her just like they treated Ruth... with respect.
If you didn't know there was a problem, you would've thought she's perfectly normal.
Hi.
It's true.
I'm early today.
No.
Don't go.
I wanted to talk to you, anyway.
No.
I want to hel... work with you.
I understand that you're scared.
I understand nothing.
Sarah!
Come back here.
Sarah.
Yelling at the back of a deaf person.
Very good, James.
He's been at all the best schools.
Why did you stop going home?
Did your sister's friends, those boys that you were going out with, did they have anything to do with it?
Yes.
I talked to your mother.
Please, let me help you, damn it!
How?
By showing you the joys of sex with a hearing man?
I think that's one language you don't speak.
Yeah, O.K. I'm so...
Come on.
I can take it.
You have more than enough communication skills.
I don't.
They never did?
O.K.
[Stamps Floor]
Hey!
Who is they?
Hearing boys?
They could never be bothered to learn my language.
I was always expected to learn to speak.
Well, I don't speak.
Sex was always something I could do as well as hearing girls.
Better!
At first, I let them have me because they wanted to.
Before long, the boys were lined up on a waiting list my sister kept for me.
No introduction, no talk.
Just went to a dark place and...
They didn't even take me out for a Coke first.
That's not what I wanted to know about you.
I thought I was such a big deal... coming on to the deaf girl, giving her a thrill.
No, Sarah.
All the time, you were laughing at me.
I was thinking, "poor little deaf virgin who spread her legs for every..."
You think that I'm threatened by that?
You think that I give a good goddamn that you fucked every pimply-faced teenager?
I don't.
I don't give a shit!
Whoo.
Sarah, please listen to me.
I'm not going away.
I did the wrong thing.
I'm sorry.
I...
I don't know what to say.
Tell me what to say.
Sarah... you are the most mysterious, beautiful, angry person
I have ever met.
I am falling in lo...
Sarah...
Sarah...
I am falling... into the pool with you!
God!
What a fellow has to go through.

We've got to have you to the house.
I'd like that.
I warn you, though...
I'm a poker player.
So I've heard.
Are you a card player?
No, not really.
Tic-tac-toe's my game.
So much the better, huh?
Well...
Thanks for coming in, Jim.
We're really happy to have you with us.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Oh, uh... your size?
Yeah.
Be careful, Jimbo.
Right.
Don't fight it.
Relax.
[Tango Music Plays]
Daphne.
Hmm?
You're leading again.
Sorry.
I got a funny sensation in my toes... like someone was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Let's throw another log on the fire.
[Tango Music Plays]
Ole!
[Jim] Ow!
Ow, ow, ow.
You are... the... nicest person...
I've... ever met.
Who, me?
I'm the nicest person you've ever met?
That's the craziest thing that I ever heard.
You thought after what you told me... that you'd never see me again?
Here I am.
Yeah, I was in love, but... she broke my heart.
Oh.
Yeah, I know.
Please don't break my heart.
Did anyone ever break yours?
You don't hurt from other people?
You never hurt from other people?
That's not true.
Sarah, I know people have hurt you.
I know.
Suppose you admitted that you hurt.
I'd... shrivel up and...
I'll take care of you, Sarah.
I'll take care of you.
What do you mean, that was my foul?
You moved into me.
You want to call me an asshole, say it.
No.
Say it out loud.
Watch my lips.
Asshole.
Ah-hole.
Ass... hole.
Ass-hole.
Great!
Asshole.
Good.
It was still your foul.
Asshole!
Did you know that waves strike the average beach about 750,000 times a day?
Wha...
That's true.
I just made it up.
You do?
What do waves sound like?
Whoo.
That is what they sound like.
How did you get to be so brilliant and beautiful?
And pigheaded.
You're the most stubborn person.
Yeah, you.
You're not stubborn?
O.K.
Hi, beautiful.
What am I saying?
Wait.
Sarah, that was a joke.
It wasn't funny.
O.K., I won't do it again.
I promise.
Sarah...
I promise.
Come on!
Mr. Harrison!
How are you?
Couldn't be better, Curtis.
Ah-ha.
Jim Harrison.
He donated the chemistry lab.
Your boy Glen is coming along.
He's a fine lad.
Has he changed that idiotic haircut?
No.
I like to give the kids a lot of leeway.
Asshole!
Shit For Brains!
Look at those shingles.
Guess they'll all have to be replaced.

This is us.
This is Sarah and me.
I love her!
Sure, the kids made me happy.
Is that against the law?
I don't hate you for not learning how to speak.
Sarah...
Sarah, I...
Iove you.
I need you.

It's your suitcase.
You are moving in with me today.
Here.

You can do whatever you want.

Me.

You want... deaf children?
What do you want me to say, that I want deaf children?
No, I don't.
But if they were, that would be fine.
Ah.
Could you get me some more, too?
I don't think she heard me.

I don't think you're an asshole anymore.
No?

Oh, come in.
Come in, please.
Oh, Martha, Sarah's here, too.
You've taught her to play poker?
Not me.
She learned it out of a book.
Well, about that time.
Sarah knows how to play poker?
It's good to see you again.
You look... mmm!
Here.
Sit next to me.
No, no, no.
No couples together.
Let's break it up.
Come on, break it up.
Sarah... no cheating.
Don't start, Curtis.
I've seen deaf people cheat like bandits.
Come on.
Oh, yes.
Those little signs that no one will see.
Very funny, Franklin.
Don't pay attention to him.
With Jim, of course.
Together, you can clean up.
Jim won't cheat.
He's not deaf.
That's very good.
Very good, Sarah.
Very good.

You're doing great with her, Jim.
Yeah, what a change.
Pretty impressive, James.
What about the poor guys that lost?
Want these here or in the kitchen?
No, I'll clean up.
It's no bother.
It's fine.
I can't believe how well she played.
There goes my mad money.
Great.
James... where can I get a copy of that book?
You are smart.
She bluffed me.
I folded with three of a kind.
Did you teach her that?
Quite a coup, James.
A lesson for us all.
Oh, God.
God, I can't ever get close enough.
Say my name.
Just once, say my name.
I'm sorry.
I need it...
I'm...

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

No.
No.

Hello.
What?

[Tires Squealing]
It's for you.
It's one of the dorm counselors.
He's translating a call from a deaf man.
It's Orin.
Lydia, Danny!
For god's sake...
It's over.
Bye.
Thank God for small favors.
O.K. You still there?
Great.
You both ready?
We're both ready.
This is Sarah speaking to Orin.
Hi.
Why are you calling?
I'm having a small dinner party.
I want you to come, please.
How about me, please?
Don't translate that to Orin.
Please.
No, I'm not saying please.
Wait a minute.
That was Orin saying please.
Look, it's my fault.
I probably sounded like myself instead of like the dorm counselor sounding like Orin.
He wants you to come to a party for...
Marian Loesser.
Please.
Great.
Um...
She is dying to see you.
Bring James!
Friday at 7:00.
O.K. Fine.
We'll be there.
Yeah.
Thank you.
My God.
Either I just went deaf, or it is suddenly quiet in here.
I do not make everything into a joke.
I possibly obscure...
How the hell would you sign "obscure"?
Obscure.
I'm going to rest my hands and my eyes and listen to 20 minutes of Bach.
You know...
I haven't turned on my hi-fi since you...
Hold it.
That sounds like... like I'm blaming you for me not listening to music.
Thank you.
I will.
I'll rest my hands... and listen to something beautiful.
[Bach Plays]
I can't enjoy it.
I can't, because you can't.
[Bach Plays]
Show you the music?
Let's see...
I can't.
Don't be sad for you.
All right, I won't.
What should you wear to the party?
I don't know.
Have I ever heard of who?
Oh, Marian.
She's the lady the party's for?
No.
Should I have?
She's very famous in the deaf community.
Nice catch.
She has two Ph.D. s, and she doesn't speak.
Take a look at these.
Hungry?
I can't communicate with someone when my mind is busy amusing itself.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
What do you hear?
I mean, is it just silence?
No one has ever gotten in there to find out?
Will you ever let me in?
She's something, isn't she?
Is she a lawyer or something?
Uh-uh.
An economist in Washington.
A real math whiz.
How thrilling.
Yeah.
It is.
I just feel like everyone is talking in some far northern Hungarian dialect over there.
I know the feeling.
Just because I wanted to leave, doesn't mean you wanted to leave.
All right.
Sarah, what the hell is wrong with you tonight?
I'll wait.
Sure.
Marian's great.
So what?
She has everything.
Education.
Great job.
Money.
Well, I'll tell you one thing that she has not got.
Me.
Oh, we're not talking about me for once.
That's true.
Hey...
Let's crawl under the covers, sweetheart, and pretend we're in some... romantic, distant place.
We're not.
We're here.
Right.
O.K.
Let's deal with it.
What is making you so miserable?
Oh...
Let's go to sleep?
No.
You can't start a bonfire and then say night-night.
And you can't start a bonfire and then run away, either.
Oh, you can do anything you want?
Yeah, like what?
Nothing.
I can do nothing.
I'm equipped for nothing and trained for nothing.
You feel like an idiot.
I treat you like an idiot?
I pity you?
Wait a second.
And now you see Marian...
What about Marian?
Let you be you?
I don't?
I want you to be a deaf person so I can change you into a hearing person?
I don't want to help anybody.
I just want to change and control...
Good night.
No... you think that I want you to speak.
And you just want to be you?
Well, who the hell are you?
Right.
[Stamps Floor]
What?
God, you want to make love now?
Fuck you, lady.
Oh, that's what you want.
You understood that.
That didn't help much.
Oh, it helped you?
Great.
That's really wonderful.
Makes me happy.
What a night.
I think that helped.
Yeah?
What have you just decided?
No one's ever going to speak for you again?
Come on.
How are you going to manage?
Everyone's always told me who I am, and I let them.
"She wants, she thinks."
And most of the time they were wrong.
They had no idea what I said, wanted, thought.
And now they won't.
Well, that's all right.
I'll buy that.
No, I won't.
How could I?
Because I love you.
Love has nothing to do with it?
That's wonderful.
Then what the hell have we been doing?
Watch your hands?
It's hard to avoid them.
This sign... to connect... simple.
But it means so much more when I do this.
Now it means... to be joined in a relationship.
Separate, but one.
That's what I want.
But you think for me, think for Sarah.
As though there were no "I."
She will be with me, quit her job, learn how to play poker, leave Orin's party, learn how to speak.
That's all you, not me.
Until you let me be an "I,"
the way you are, you can never come inside my silence and know me.
And I won't let myself know you.
Until that time... we can't be like this... joined.
Well... that's all very moving.
But... how are you going to manage?
You can lock yourself back in your precious silent castle...
I heard.
I heard every word, goddamn it.
I translated for myself.
It went from your hands into my brain and out my mouth.
And you know what?
I think you're lying.
I don't think that you think being deaf is so goddamn wonderful.
I think that you're scared to death to try.
I think it's nothing but stupid pride that's keeping you from speaking right.
You want to be on your own.
You don't want to be pitied.
Then you learn to read my lips and use your mouth for something besides showing me you're better than hearing girls in bed.
Read my lips.
What am I saying?
What am...
You want to talk to me, then you learn my language.
Did you understand that?
You've probably been reading lips for years.
But that's the great control game, isn't it?
I'm the controller?
What a fucking joke.
Now, come on!
Speak to me!
Speak!
Speak to me!
Aah!
See my mouth?
Aah!
Hear my voice?
Aah!
Aah!
I'm not afraid!
Hot chocolate.
Your favorite.
Have you... come... home... to stay?
Of course you can.
As long as you like.
You need a job, but there's nothing.
I'll...
I'll...
I'll help.
I... never helped.
Don't... hurt me now.
The last time, you... we... sent you away because...
I didn't know... how to... take care of you.
Your father... couldn't accept you.
He felt... he'd failed.
You're right.
I hated you... for... driving him away.
Please... forgive me.
[Telephone Rings]
[Ring]
Telephone.
What...
What should I say?
[Ring]
[Ring]
[Ring]
Hello.
No...
I'm sorry, James.
No, she's not.
All right.
I'll call you if I see her.
[Bach Plays]
Favorite books.
Favorite books.
Good.
Do you have any favorite books, Glen?
Yeah.
Skull?
I'll put that on my summer reading list.
I have to see her.
I know she doesn't want to see me.
She's made that very clear.
But I have to see her.
She'll let you know when she wants to see you.
She's working now.
She's saving her money.
She wants to go to college.
That's fine.
That's wonderful.
Um...
I've looked all over, Mrs. Norman.
Please.
Spring cleaning.
How was your day?
Are you O.K.?
No.
You're not fine.
You're lonely.
[Music Box Plays]
He was here.
He misses you.
You don't know what to do.
I think maybe you do.

You've been angry since you were a little girl.
You didn't want to hurt again, so you used your anger... to push me away.

I'm sorry... for hurting you.
But you learned from me.
You learned that you can hurt... and you won't shrivel up and blow away.
I don't want to be without you, either.
Do you think... that we could find a place... where we can meet... not in silence... and not in sound?
[Waves Crashing]
[Bell Rings]
This is the most amazing resume I've ever seen.
I've been with some really good schools.
The best.
All of them.
All of the best.
One right after another.
And you've also been with the Lucky Erin Bar and Grill.
Pittsburgh.
Bartender.
And a disc jockey.
In Oklahoma.
I used to broadcast in sign language.
You've been all over the map.
I've got a lot of energy.
I'm sure you do have a lot of energy and a lot of new ideas.
I did, too, when...
But nobody's trying to change the world around here.
Just trying to help a few deaf kids get along a little better, that's all.
Everything else is razzle-dazzle.
Am I, uh... am I making myself clear?
Yes, I believe that you are.
[Buzzing]
Are we being punished?
Hi.
I'm James Leeds, and... my signing is rusty, so how many of you can read lips?
No one?
O.K. Class dismissed.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Just testing.
Sit down.
Lydia and Tony, good lip readers.
Would you mind closing your notebook?
Thank you.
Now, give me one good reason why we should learn to speak.
Tony.
To pick up hearing girls.
To pick up hearing girls.
O.K. Let's work on this.
All right.
Now...
here.
You.
You.
O.K. Here are two beautiful hearing girls.
You two guys want to pick them up.
What is the first thing you want to say, Danny?
Are you rich?
Are you r-i-i-ch?
Say it.
Rich.
Good.
Lydia.
I'm very rich.
Good.
Tony.
Let's go somewhere and do it.
No, thank you.
Let's go somewhere and do it-t.
I would rather do it with her.
Cute.
How about you guys?
You want to join us?
They don't talk.
Fair enough.
O.K. Reasons to talk.
Right.
If your hands are occupied.
For example, some guy owes you money.
He comes by, but you just happen to be in a handstand.
How will you tell him to give you your money?
You can't use your hands.
You've got to speak.
Give me my money, you bum.
Call me names, will you?
I don't have to stand here and take that.
You want to fight, huh?
O.K. Put up your feet and fight like a man.
See?
[Crash]
Take your pots... and your lousy food and shove them...
Doesn't mince words, does she?
Mr. Leeds.
Mr. Leeds.
Oh, Leeds!
Leeds!
Join us.
Sure.
O.K.
Sorry.
Good thing you're out of my classroom.
Sit down, James.
Mary Lee Ochs, Assistant Superintendent.
Orin Dennis, math and social studies.
James Leeds.
Leeds.
Hi.
Did I hear Miss Ochs say you were one of her students?
Yes.
I started here at 5.
Really?
Wow, that's great.
I'm impressed.
For still being here?
Not what I meant.
See you all later.
Bye.
Who is that?
That's Sarah.
Never mind her.
She's a pain in the ass.
But who is she?
What does she do?
She works here.
Orin, I've got an idea.
How about the kids making potholders for parents' day?
They don't sell.
We've got hundreds left from last year.
We do?
Oh.
We do?
Oh.
Sarah came here at 5, too.
We grew up together.
Is she a teacher, too?
She was one of our brightest students.
Would you give me some of the water?
Thank you.
Leeds, you're a genius.
You will work.

A drip.
[Very Loud] Oh!
What a drip!
No.
No.
No!
No!
That's not what I meant.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm James Leeds.
It's Sarah, isn't it?
Would you like to sit down?
Right here.
O.K. We'll both stand up.
Oh, I see.
Very good.
You got me there.
Could you look at me, please?
If you don't look at me, I can't...
So, um...
Dr. Franklin tells me that you've been here since you were 5.
Mm-hmm.
Um... when did you graduate?
And, uh, now... now...
now you work here?
Are you reading my lips?
I don't think that you are reading my lips.
Ohhh...
Gee, that was quick of me, wasn't it?
You could've told me.
Why?
I don't know.
How about common courtesy?
How about me getting out of here so you can mop the floor?
Man... you know, if you let me,
I bet I could teach you how to speak.
And you could teach me... but I don't want to mop the floor.
Gee, that was quick.
And you don't want to speak.
Brilliant.
Schmuck.
It's a damn shame.
Costly, too.
Resodding is damn costly.
No.
I'm talking about Sarah Norman.
Right.
Sarah.
Look at this, will you?
What a mess.
Has she ever tried speaking?
Sarah's not hard of hearing.
She's totally deaf.
Born that way.
That makes it tough.
The rain's lousing up the fields.
It's a shame that a bright woman is stuck here cleaning toilets.
Doesn't bother her.
Oh, no?
Look, hotshot, not everyone wants to be a star.
Sarah is content.
She had a rotten childhood.
She was diagnosed as retarded until she was 7.
We let her know how smart she was.
For what?
She's productive.
Pays taxes.
Oh, brother.
All right.
You want to try?
I'll talk to her.
Huh?
I'll talk to her.
Look at this.
Will you look at this?
Damn!
It's going to cost $2,000 or $3,000 at least.
Oh, brother.
S-S-Sat.
Sat.
All right.
[Bell Rings]
That's good.
You have to work on S's, though.
O.K.?
Go.
Out.
James, Sarah has agreed to give you an hour.
She's really looking forward to it.
You're really looking forward to it, aren't you?
What did I tell you?
Well, uh...
have fun, Jim... as usual.
Well, Sarah, uh... yeah.
I do mind, actually.
Fire laws and all that, but you go right ahead.
Listen... how would you like to fake out Franklin, make me look real good?
I'm sorry.
I didn't get that.
Uh... if...
I... don't... sign... faster... the hour will be over before I finish my opening speech.
No.
I'm all out of jokes.
Good.
I'm not funny.
Oh, yeah?
If you could hear, you'd think I was a scream.
You're deaf?
Well, I'll try to remember that.
I'll forget?
No, I won't.
Listen, um... why don't we get this thing started here?
Well, thank you for stopping by.
The pleasure was mine.
God.
My mama.
Your mama.
Great.
Go.
Glen, who's your favorite person?
Twisted Sister?
Twisted Sister?
It's the name of the rock group.
Oh.
Oh.
Try saying that.
Twisted Sister.
Glen, it takes courage.
I know.
Just give me one sound.
One. "T."
"T."
Try.
"T."
"T."
Tweeh...
That's great.
That's great.
Yeah.
Out of here.
Go.
Great.
Johnny?
Who's your favorite person?
Princess Di?
Benji?
No.
Terminator?
Uh...
[Bell Rings]
Hey.
Hey, you want to play stand up, sit down again?
Whoa, careful, you almost smiled.
Ah, that's a girl.
That's the Sarah Norman we all know and love.
If my jokes are terrible and my signing is boring, what are you doing here?
There's a whole empty beach.
Unbelievable.
I tried to call your mother.
Hey.
Hold it.
Wait.
Wait.
I can't...
I didn't even talk to her.
O.K.?
I mean, can we stop this?
I mean, why can't we...
I mean, why can't we just... why don't we... why don't we... go out and have some dinner tonight?
Huh?
Just give me a yes or a no.
Yes?
Good.
I think.
O.K. Um...
I will meet you behind, uh... the girls' dormitory, 8:00.
I will whisper your name.
Hey!
I know that sign.
That's the first sign I ever learned.
It's in Italian.
Can I suggest something?
Will you give me a break?
My Italian is worse than my signing.
The veal piccata is very good.
Look.
I'm sorry.
V-E-A-L P-I-C-C-A-T-A.
I mean, you see, by the time I finish, they may be out of it.
It's veal.
It's, uh... sauteed in lemon and butter.
What's veal?
Uh...
God.
What the hell is veal?
Um...
Good evening.
[Skipped item nr. 720]
Something to drink this evening?
You want something to drink, Sarah?
Our house wine is very nice.
You want some wine?
Yeah.
It's O.K.
Uh, white wine.
We'll take a carafe, please.
He doesn't think you're stupid.
He thinks you're deaf.
No.
Only stupid hearing people think that deaf people are stupid.
Do you really like being a cleaning woman?
Why?
Yeah.
I mean, there are other jobs where a person can work alone in silence.
Not with toilet bowl cleaner?
You should have told me that was the attraction.
You are smart as hell, you know?
You want to dance?
Can you feel it?

It's... my pleasure.
Mrs. Norman?
I'm James Leeds.
I didn't call again... because I would've hung up again.
It's 60 miles here and back.
Please, just five minutes.
I just got home from work.
This is my time to relax.
Discussing Sarah is hardly relaxing.
Five minutes.
Well.
Well.
Uh...
let's see.
You haven't seen Sarah in eight years?
Let's get this straight.
Sarah doesn't want to see me.
Has she said why?
We don't communicate very well.
Did you ever learn to sign?
Some of the parents...
I'm really sick of you people coming here every few years asking the same questions, blaming me.
God.
No one's blaming you.
Of course they are.
They can't blame themselves.
So, it's all my fault.
Fine.
I don't give a damn anymore.
I really just came to ask one question.
What happened when Sarah tried to speak?
What happened?
She looked awful.
She sounded awful.
People made fun of her.
What do you think?
Who made fun of her?
Other kids.
Her sister's friends.
Then she stopped trying to talk.
She's very pretty, you know.
Her sister Ruth had a bunch of boys hanging around, and they started asking Sarah out when she came home on weekends.
It was wonderful for her.
The boys really liked her.
They treated her just like they treated Ruth... with respect.
If you didn't know there was a problem, you would've thought she's perfectly normal.
Hi.
It's true.
I'm early today.
No.
Don't go.
I wanted to talk to you, anyway.
No.
I want to hel... work with you.
I understand that you're scared.
I understand nothing.
Sarah!
Come back here.
Sarah.
Yelling at the back of a deaf person.
Very good, James.
He's been at all the best schools.
Why did you stop going home?
Did your sister's friends, those boys that you were going out with, did they have anything to do with it?
Yes.
I talked to your mother.
Please, let me help you, damn it!
How?
By showing you the joys of sex with a hearing man?
I think that's one language you don't speak.
Yeah, O.K. I'm so...
Come on.
I can take it.
You have more than enough communication skills.
I don't.
They never did?
O.K.
[Stamps Floor]
Hey!
Who is they?
Hearing boys?
They could never be bothered to learn my language.
I was always expected to learn to speak.
Well, I don't speak.
Sex was always something I could do as well as hearing girls.
Better!
At first, I let them have me because they wanted to.
Before long, the boys were lined up on a waiting list my sister kept for me.
No introduction, no talk.
Just went to a dark place and...
They didn't even take me out for a Coke first.
That's not what I wanted to know about you.
I thought I was such a big deal... coming on to the deaf girl, giving her a thrill.
No, Sarah.
All the time, you were laughing at me.
I was thinking, "poor little deaf virgin who spread her legs for every..."
You think that I'm threatened by that?
You think that I give a good goddamn that you fucked every pimply-faced teenager?
I don't.
I don't give a shit!
Whoo.
Sarah, please listen to me.
I'm not going away.
I did the wrong thing.
I'm sorry.
I...
I don't know what to say.
Tell me what to say.
Sarah... you are the most mysterious, beautiful, angry person
I have ever met.
I am falling in lo...
Sarah...
Sarah...
I am falling... into the pool with you!
God!
What a fellow has to go through.

How are things going, Jim?
Great.
Just great.
Good.
Good.
Glad to hear it.
We've got to have you to the house.
I'd like that.
I warn you, though...
I'm a poker player.
So I've heard.
Are you a card player?
No, not really.
Tic-tac-toe's my game.
So much the better, huh?
Well...
Thanks for coming in, Jim.
We're really happy to have you with us.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Oh, uh... your size?
Yeah.
Be careful, Jimbo.
Right.
Don't fight it.
Relax.
[Tango Music Plays]
Daphne.
Hmm?
You're leading again.
Sorry.
I got a funny sensation in my toes... like someone was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Let's throw another log on the fire.
[Tango Music Plays]
Ole!
[Jim] Ow!
Ow, ow, ow.
You are... the... nicest person...
I've... ever met.
Who, me?
I'm the nicest person you've ever met?
That's the craziest thing that I ever heard.
You thought after what you told me... that you'd never see me again?
Here I am.
Yeah, I was in love, but... she broke my heart.
Oh.
Yeah, I know.
Please don't break my heart.
Did anyone ever break yours?
You don't hurt from other people?
You never hurt from other people?
That's not true.
Sarah, I know people have hurt you.
I know.
Suppose you admitted that you hurt.
I'd... shrivel up and...
I'll take care of you, Sarah.
I'll take care of you.
What do you mean, that was my foul?
You moved into me.
You want to call me an asshole, say it.
No.
Say it out loud.
Watch my lips.
Asshole.
Ah-hole.
Ass... hole.
Ass-hole.
Great!
Asshole.
Good.
It was still your foul.
Asshole!
Did you know that waves strike the average beach about 750,000 times a day?
Wha...
That's true.
I just made it up.
You do?
What do waves sound like?
Whoo.
That is what they sound like.
How did you get to be so brilliant and beautiful?
And pigheaded.
You're the most stubborn person.
Yeah, you.
You're not stubborn?
O.K.
Hi, beautiful.
What am I saying?
Wait.
Sarah, that was a joke.
It wasn't funny.
O.K., I won't do it again.
I promise.
Sarah...
I promise.
Come on!
Mr. Harrison!
How are you?
Couldn't be better, Curtis.
Ah-ha.
Jim Harrison.
He donated the chemistry lab.
Your boy Glen is coming along.
He's a fine lad.
Has he changed that idiotic haircut?
No.
I like to give the kids a lot of leeway.
Asshole!
Shit For Brains!
Look at those shingles.
Guess they'll all have to be replaced.
[Applause]
Thank you, Mr. Jones' class for your informative demonstration of the importance of the four food groups.

Where did they leave it?
In here.
Where in here?
What did they do?
Just a cut, huh?
It's five stitches, huh?
You stupid son of...
She could have seriously hurt herself... in front of a parent.
It's going to stop now.
What?
I don't know what made her upset.
You've got no right to mess her up!
She is not messed up.
I'm not discussing this.
Nobody's going to fuck with one of my students.
She's no student!
She's a 25-year-old woman!
Nobody's going to fuck with one of my employees.
It's going to stop!
She's quitting her job!
She's what?
She's quitting.
She's moving in with me!
Oh.
Oh, I see.
She's going to be your maid now, huh?
Jesus Christ, Franklin.
James, James...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That wasn't fair.
That wasn't fair to Sarah, either.
I've seen this kind of thing before.
It just doesn't work!
This isn't this kind of thing.
This is us.
This is Sarah and me.
I love her!
Sure, the kids made me happy.
Is that against the law?
I don't hate you for not learning how to speak.
Sarah...
Sarah, I...
Iove you.
I need you.
Where are your suitcases?
Aha!
[Stamps On Floor]
It's your suitcase.
You are moving in with me today.
Here.
I'm packing your clothes.
You'll need some clothes.
Now, it's your turn.
Screw your job.
I got mine.
You can do whatever you want.
Sarah... what do you want?
Me.
You got me.
What else?
Children.
You want... deaf children?
What do you want me to say, that I want deaf children?
No, I don't.
But if they were, that would be fine.
Ah.
Could you get me some more, too?
I don't think she heard me.
Mr. Leeds!
I don't think you're an asshole anymore.
No?
No.
I think you're a... dick-brain.
Dick-brain?
That's fantastic.
I got it right away.
Yeah, Dick-brain.
Really excellent.
Good work.
Choo choo choo choo.
Choo choo choo choo.
Machine, freeze.
Favorite candy, Tony.
Chunky.
Good.
Go.
Freeze.
Favorite animal, Lydia.
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Fine actor, fine actor.
Go!
Freeze.
Favorite football player...
Ooh.
Johnny.
Thank you, Johnny.
And favorite football hero, Cheryl.
Billy "White Shoes" Johnson.
Great choice.
Go.
You ready?
No, Franklin will not expect you to speak.
My God, you look so gorgeous.
[Doorbell Rings]
I'll get it.
This is great.
I cannot believe this...
James.
And Sarah!
Oh, come in.
Come in, please.
Oh, Martha, Sarah's here, too.
You've taught her to play poker?
Not me.
She learned it out of a book.
Well, about that time.
Sarah knows how to play poker?
It's good to see you again.
You look... mmm!
Here.
Sit next to me.
No, no, no.
No couples together.
Let's break it up.
Come on, break it up.
Sarah... no cheating.
Don't start, Curtis.
I've seen deaf people cheat like bandits.
Come on.
Oh, yes.
Those little signs that no one will see.
Very funny, Franklin.
Don't pay attention to him.
With Jim, of course.
Together, you can clean up.
Jim won't cheat.
He's not deaf.
That's very good.
Very good, Sarah.
Very good.
High card deals.
9. 10.
You're high.
You deal.
Nickel, dime, and quarter.
All of them?
Yes.
Ante up, everybody.
Out of a book, huh?
Five card draw.
One-eyed jacks wild.
One-eyed jacks wild?
One-eyed jacks.
O.K.
You're doing great with her, Jim.
Yeah, what a change.
Pretty impressive, James.
What about the poor guys that lost?
Want these here or in the kitchen?
No, I'll clean up.
It's no bother.
It's fine.
I can't believe how well she played.
There goes my mad money.
Great.
James... where can I get a copy of that book?
You are smart.
She bluffed me.
I folded with three of a kind.
Did you teach her that?
Quite a coup, James.
A lesson for us all.
Oh, God.
God, I can't ever get close enough.
Say my name.
Just once, say my name.
I'm sorry.
I need it...
I'm...
I know I promised.
I'm sorry.
I forgot.
I...
I'm not lying.
I don't want you to speak.
It just came out.
Please, it just...
I'm sorry.
Hike!
No.
No.
I don't care!
They killed my brother.
Don't kill him!
Don't shoot!
They'll shoot you, too!
Get out of my way!
Shoot please!
Do it for me!
[Gunshots]
Can we have some soda?
Yes.
[Telephone Rings]
The phone is ringing.
What?
The phone is ringing.
What phone?
The phone you can't hear because it's so noisy.
Turn that damn thing down.
Good grief.
What am I saying?
[Ring]
The phone is ringing.
The TV is blasting.
[Teakettle Whistles]
The kettle...
If someone would just fire a bazooka through the window.
[Gunshots]
Can you hold on?
That would be great.
Water's boiling.
Hello.
What?
Ask him to hang on for a second.
[Tires Squealing]
It's for you.
It's one of the dorm counselors.
He's translating a call from a deaf man.
It's Orin.
Lydia, Danny!
For god's sake...
It's over.
Bye.
Thank God for small favors.
O.K. You still there?
Great.
You both ready?
We're both ready.
This is Sarah speaking to Orin.
Hi.
Why are you calling?
I'm having a small dinner party.
I want you to come, please.
How about me, please?
Don't translate that to Orin.
Please.
No, I'm not saying please.
Wait a minute.
That was Orin saying please.
Look, it's my fault.
I probably sounded like myself instead of like the dorm counselor sounding like Orin.
He wants you to come to a party for...
Marian Loesser.
Please.
Great.
Um...
She is dying to see you.
Bring James!
Friday at 7:00.
O.K. Fine.
We'll be there.
Yeah.
Thank you.
My God.
Either I just went deaf, or it is suddenly quiet in here.
I do not make everything into a joke.
I possibly obscure...
How the hell would you sign "obscure"?
Obscure.
I'm going to rest my hands and my eyes and listen to 20 minutes of Bach.
You know...
I haven't turned on my hi-fi since you...
Hold it.
That sounds like... like I'm blaming you for me not listening to music.
Thank you.
I will.
I'll rest my hands... and listen to something beautiful.
[Bach Plays]
I can't enjoy it.
I can't, because you can't.
[Bach Plays]
Show you the music?
Let's see...
I can't.
Don't be sad for you.
All right, I won't.
What should you wear to the party?
I don't know.
Have I ever heard of who?
Oh, Marian.
She's the lady the party's for?
No.
Should I have?
She's very famous in the deaf community.
Nice catch.
She has two Ph.D. s, and she doesn't speak.
Take a look at these.
Hungry?
I can't communicate with someone when my mind is busy amusing itself.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
What do you hear?
I mean, is it just silence?
No one has ever gotten in there to find out?
Will you ever let me in?
She's something, isn't she?
Is she a lawyer or something?
Uh-uh.
An economist in Washington.
A real math whiz.
How thrilling.
Yeah.
It is.
I just feel like everyone is talking in some far northern Hungarian dialect over there.
I know the feeling.
Just because I wanted to leave, doesn't mean you wanted to leave.
All right.
Sarah, what the hell is wrong with you tonight?
I'll wait.
Sure.
Marian's great.
So what?
She has everything.
Education.
Great job.
Money.
Well, I'll tell you one thing that she has not got.
Me.
Oh, we're not talking about me for once.
That's true.
Hey...
Let's crawl under the covers, sweetheart, and pretend we're in some... romantic, distant place.
We're not.
We're here.
Right.
O.K.
Let's deal with it.
What is making you so miserable?
Oh...
Let's go to sleep?
No.
You can't start a bonfire and then say night-night.
And you can't start a bonfire and then run away, either.
Oh, you can do anything you want?
Yeah, like what?
Nothing.
I can do nothing.
I'm equipped for nothing and trained for nothing.
You feel like an idiot.
I treat you like an idiot?
I pity you?
Wait a second.
And now you see Marian...
What about Marian?
Let you be you?
I don't?
I want you to be a deaf person so I can change you into a hearing person?
I don't want to help anybody.
I just want to change and control...
Good night.
No... you think that I want you to speak.
And you just want to be you?
Well, who the hell are you?
Right.
[Stamps Floor]
What?
God, you want to make love now?
Fuck you, lady.
Oh, that's what you want.
You understood that.
That didn't help much.
Oh, it helped you?
Great.
That's really wonderful.
Makes me happy.
What a night.
I think that helped.
Yeah?
What have you just decided?
No one's ever going to speak for you again?
Come on.
How are you going to manage?
Everyone's always told me who I am, and I let them.
"She wants, she thinks."
And most of the time they were wrong.
They had no idea what I said, wanted, thought.
And now they won't.
Well, that's all right.
I'll buy that.
No, I won't.
How could I?
Because I love you.
Love has nothing to do with it?
That's wonderful.
Then what the hell have we been doing?
Watch your hands?
It's hard to avoid them.
This sign... to connect... simple.
But it means so much more when I do this.
Now it means... to be joined in a relationship.
Separate, but one.
That's what I want.
But you think for me, think for Sarah.
As though there were no "I."
She will be with me, quit her job, learn how to play poker, leave Orin's party, learn how to speak.
That's all you, not me.
Until you let me be an "I,"
the way you are, you can never come inside my silence and know me.
And I won't let myself know you.
Until that time... we can't be like this... joined.
Well... that's all very moving.
But... how are you going to manage?
You can lock yourself back in your precious silent castle...
I heard.
I heard every word, goddamn it.
I translated for myself.
It went from your hands into my brain and out my mouth.
And you know what?
I think you're lying.
I don't think that you think being deaf is so goddamn wonderful.
I think that you're scared to death to try.
I think it's nothing but stupid pride that's keeping you from speaking right.
You want to be on your own.
You don't want to be pitied.
Then you learn to read my lips and use your mouth for something besides showing me you're better than hearing girls in bed.
Read my lips.
What am I saying?
What am...
You want to talk to me, then you learn my language.
Did you understand that?
You've probably been reading lips for years.
But that's the great control game, isn't it?
I'm the controller?
What a fucking joke.
Now, come on!
Speak to me!
Speak!
Speak to me!
Aah!
See my mouth?
Aah!
Hear my voice?
Aah!
Aah!
I'm not afraid!
Hot chocolate.
Your favorite.
Have you... come... home... to stay?
Of course you can.
As long as you like.
You need a job, but there's nothing.
I'll...
I'll...
I'll help.
I... never helped.
Don't... hurt me now.
The last time, you... we... sent you away because...
I didn't know... how to... take care of you.
Your father... couldn't accept you.
He felt... he'd failed.
You're right.
I hated you... for... driving him away.
Please... forgive me.
[Telephone Rings]
[Ring]
Telephone.
What...
What should I say?
[Ring]
[Ring]
[Ring]
Hello.
No...
I'm sorry, James.
No, she's not.
All right.
I'll call you if I see her.
[Bach Plays]
Favorite books.
Favorite books.
Good.
Do you have any favorite books, Glen?
Yeah.
Skull?
I'll put that on my summer reading list.
I have to see her.
I know she doesn't want to see me.
She's made that very clear.
But I have to see her.
She'll let you know when she wants to see you.
She's working now.
She's saving her money.
She wants to go to college.
That's fine.
That's wonderful.
Um...
I've looked all over, Mrs. Norman.
Please.
Spring cleaning.
How was your day?
Are you O.K.?
No.
You're not fine.
You're lonely.
[Music Box Plays]
He was here.
He misses you.
You don't know what to do.
I think maybe you do.

You wanted to see me.
It was a shock, seeing you in there.
I didn't know what to do.
You were scared, too.
I hear that Boomerang song.
♪ Ooh, my love can't catch ya ♪♪
You've been angry since you were a little girl.
You didn't want to hurt again, so you used your anger... to push me away.
You're sorry.
I'm sorry... for hurting you.
But you learned from me.
You learned that you can hurt... and you won't shrivel up and blow away.
I don't want to be without you, either.
Do you think... that we could find a place... where we can meet... not in silence... and not in sound?
[Waves Crashing]
Stop.
- You, go check over there
- Go...
- See anything?
- No.
They're back here.
Follow them.
Over there...
Cousin, you better leave without me.
No.
We'll go together.
This is H.K. already.
Hurry, go.
I've made the call but I can't find your aunt.
You're a stranger in H.K., stay with me.
Scared?
Let me take it out for you.
Don't be scared...
You are incurable.
Do you have a sound reason for being transferred eleven times... within only one year after you left the cadet?
You are like a human football.
Did you hear what I said?
What?
If it's not because we're relatives.
I'll never let you work in my district.
Mom, I know.
He's here.
Phone call for you...
Uncle, there's a phone call for you.
- Sister, What is it?
- Watch out for my hat.
Don't interrupt when your elders are talking.
I'm talking to your mother.
I won't be coming.
I'm being bored to death by your son here.
Nothing you can do can amend it.
I'll tell him.
All right, bye.
What did mom say?
Don't soak your "athlete's foot" in the tub.
Your son caught the bacteria on his scalp.
It's a good thing it didn't go into his eyes.
Or else he'll have "athlete's eyes"
Shut your mouth.
I have all the experienced C.l.D. here.
Choose one as your partner.
No.
I can't stand experienced cops.
They'll be on my back constantly.
Just get me a lazy one.
But one not as handsome as I am.
That will be hard to find.
This one is the worst, How about it?
Good morning.
Judy, you can go now.
No, I want to see you go in.
Fine.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Bon, all dressed up for a modeling job?
Yes.
Playboy asks me to pose for their cover.
Can't you be serious?
I didn't say anything wrong.
Don't you want me as a model for your company?
Resign?
What's wrong with being a cop?
If something happens to your family, you can be sure I'll work hard on the case.
If you want to marry with me, you must quit.
Then, we'll just live together.
No. I've typed up your resignation letter.
How smart.
There's a typing error.
More.
- You're great.
- Let's go.
2993, you can't come and go as you please.
Being a model beats being a policeman?
Police are respected.
Have you heard of models are respected?
So I want to be a policeman.
I've transferred a top man to assist you.
Tell 23838 to come in.
When you see him, you may think I'm lying.
But, don't let your eyes deceive you.
Whether you're a good cop or not is genetic.
In him, runs the refined blood of my family.
So, you must not doubt his performance quality.
Come here...
Let me introduce you.
This is your new partner.
Long man.
King Kong.
What King Kong?
Ho Ting Bon.
Now I know why you haven't been promoted.
You talked too much.
But it doesn't matter, I like your style.
- Really?
- Birds of feather, flocked together.
Now that you're partners.
I've a case for you.
I hate apple polishing.
So, don't give me any royal treatment.
Even I'm his relative, don't do me any favours.
This is "Addict Hung".
He may have a drug deal at 4 pm tomorrow.
So, he is your uncle.
Who says?
I am his uncle.
My father is still young for his years.
I am an accident from his old age.
Did you hear what I've just said?
About "Addict Hung"?
He may have a drug deal at 4 pm tomorrow.
Correct?
- Don't you two have work to do?
- Yes, sir.
- Taste sample, please try.
- The taste is great.
Try some...
Try some.
You're been at this 3 or 4 times already.
I just want to taste it better.
With so much sampling, you should know by now.
How many boxes do you want?
You're not buying?
Then move... lt's boiled.
We've been here for 3 days.
is the information true?
True or not, we must be patient.
Being a C.l.D. is hard, I'd rather sit in office.
Shoplifting.
I know, but we can't identify ourselves.
I'm full.
Mister.
Shoplifting?
Stop right there.
Police!
Addict Hung, don't run.
What are you doing here?
Go after him.
Go...
Why are you dragging this girl along?
She was stealing, I may get promoted from this.
Just handcuffed her first.
Let's go.
- Did you see his car?
- No.
Run!
Let me go.
Let's check on her.
No serious harm done, I'll call an ambulance.
- You want to work as a cop still?
- Of course.
Well then, call a taxi and get her to a hospital.
If Headquarter finds out, it'll be the end of us.
Thank you.
You're joking?
I'm her husband?
Who'll believe it?
- There's no difference.
- l'm more like her little brother.
Who is the patient's husband?
- Him.
- Him.
Are you both her husband?
I am her ex., He's her present.
- What?
- Correct.
Her marriage to me is a mistake.
Only they belong together.
They're a lovely pair.
Till death do they part.
Right?
Fill out this information sheet for your wife.
Come on, fill it out.
If Headquarter knows about this, we'll be fired.
Consider my height.
If I'm not a cop, how else can I bully people?
If this small pleasure is snatched away from me.
What else is there left for me to live for?
Don't talk too much.
I've already admitted I'm her husband.
- l'll bear whatever consequence there's.
- That's nice to know.
If she has damaged her brain from the accident.
You're in luck.
- To have such a beautiful wife.
- Shut up.
- She looks prettier the minute.
- l'll pass her to you for sure.
Hard to find a girl with a lower lQ than yours.
Let's look again to see if we can find some l.D.
Haven't we looked earlier?
No use talking to you.
It must be hidden somewhere private.
What are you doing?
Try to take advantage?
I just want to have a more thorough search.
Nothing.
You think she might be a stowaway?
It will be great if she is, we can immediately deport her.
What should I do now?
I must continue with this pretence.
She's regaining her consciousness.
Miss, how do you feel?
Careful now.
Wai Hung.
Wai Hung?
Who is Wai Hung?
She's up.
Wai Hung, don't you recognise me?
I'm your wife, Kwong Sun.
What did you say?
Don't you recognise your own wife?
Start.
Don't be scared, you may be in shock still.
Not necessarily amnesia.
Can you hear airplanes around where you live?
Can you hear them at your place?
I can't hear them.
I can't hear them too.
That excludes around airport.
Can you see 3 huge chimneys around your house?
- Can you see them at yours?
- No.
No.
Then, it can't be around industrial estate.
Are we questioning you or are you asking us?
Aren't your place my place as well?
How can my place be the same as your place?
If my place is your place, I would have brought you home already.
What else can you remember?
- Wai Hung.
- What does Wai Hung look like?
He looks like you.
In the old movies, when the actress has amnesia.
A good scare usually helps her remember.
Are you crazy?
Screaming like that so suddenly?
- Where are you going?
- Wai Hung.
Miss, I am really not Wai Hung.
My father was an illiterate.
He would never give me such a decent name.
My name is Ho Ting Bon.
It's not yours.
l.D. pictures are just an approximation.
I'm not your husband and you're not my wife.
So, don't call me Wai Hung any more.
Just rest for awhile.
What are you doing?
Come on, let's leave.
What?
We got her this way, We can't just go.
She can't remember a thing.
What else can we do?
Well, we can ask her to stand on the road.
Let her get run over by a car again.
If she's lucky, the hit may regain her memories.
If she's died from the crash at least we can get rid of her.
Let's go.
I can't believe you can even think such things.
No wonder you're so short.
I'm waiting for someone.
Please come back later.
- Now what?
- Well, to make you feel better.
Let's have our Royal Majesty decide.
If it's heads, we'll go.
If it's tail, we stay.
Heads.
This is fate.
Let's go.
Well, there are letters on the head side too.
I saw the 2 gentlemen left at the backdoor.
What?
You want to eat without paying?
What are you doing to my wife?
See?
I told you my husband won't leave me here.
This is counterfeit money?
I'm sorry...
Don't ever tell people I'm your husband again.
Yes, Wai Hung.
Where are we going, Wai Hung?
I want to do some shopping.
What do you want to buy, Wai Hung?
Wai Hung is indeed a pleasant name.
But my name is not Wai Hung.
It's really no use telling you this, is it?
Let's play a game, all right?
What game?
It's called, "My name is not Wai Hung".
That name, even if I am really your husband.
Let's pretend I'm not tonight.
Just treat me as a friend.
When you regain your memories back, all is well if I'm really your husband.
Even if I'm not, you still haven't been taken in.
- Then, I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?
If you're not my husband, I can't be with you.
All right, we won't play this game.
We'll play another game.
You can treat me as your husband.
I'll just pretend to have a wife tonight.
I thought having a wife means I can relax.
Turns out I have to sweat myself in the kitchen.
The taste is not bad.
Chow time.
Come sit down.
It smells wonderful.
- Not yet.
There's more.
- What's that?
Champagne.
Bottoms up.
Let me teach you another game.
You're stupid, I'm stupid, he's stupid...
You're stupid, I'm stupid, he's stupid...
Drink up.
One more time.
Apprentice overtakes the master.
It's not fair.
Do the dishes...
What about you?
You go.
You're my wife, doing dishes is your job.
You keep saying I'm not. I won't do them.
You can't get away with it this time.
Get up.
Whoever the bottle points at will do the dishes.
Fine with me.
- l can't believe this.
- Go do the dishes.
All right.
They're all clean now.
No way.
Wash them properly.
There're no such rules in this household.
Let the rats clean them then.
Get up.
Cheat.
China City Night Club.
Can I talk to the cleaning lady "Ah Wan"?
Who?
Can you speak louder?
The cleaning lady, "Ah Wan".
She doesn't work here anymore.
Where can I reach her?
Who are you?
I'm her niece from Kwong Zhou.
Please give me her address.
Please wait.
Thank you, go on.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Sorry.
My hands are tied.
This is a fat chicken. lt didn't go far.
Thank you, miss.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Rise and shine.
Morning, mom.
Morning still?
What brings you here so early?
My club fees are due for collection today.
Why are you sleeping in the living room?
I have a friend staying in my bedroom.
A friend?
Boyfriend or girlfriend?
A girlfriend.
A girl?
Not that kind.
We're just friends.
Of course I know it's not that kind.
Or else why won't you be sleeping in there?
Strange, where is she?
is your friend up yet?
She's gone.
When are you going to bring your girl over?
How about tonight?
I'll ask her to come for dinner.
What are her favourite dishes?
Mom, don't you spoil her.
She has a bad enough temper as it is.
If you pamper her, she'll be worse.
Your mom has a reputation for being nice.
I know what to do.
It's useless to put on a strict face.
Nowadays, it's important to be easy and friendly.
Go, clean up and have breakfast.
Auntie Wan.
Kwong Sun.
You've already come to Hong Kong?
Before mom died, she did ask me to come see you.
Mommy, Skinny took Billy's bottle.
I don't believe this, you bad boy.
Billy took my ink bottle first.
You kids are all useless.
Look at you. lnk all over.
Auntie Wan, can I stay at your place?
- Who's here?
- My sister's daughter, Kwong Sun.
She wants to live here with us.
Uncle.
There shouldn't be any problem.
Let her stay here.
Sure.
Where can she sleep?
Just shut your big mouth.
Any rice left?
I left it on the stove.
Go get it yourself.
All you do is eat and sleep.
What a lazy bum.
I must eat if I'm hungry.
Mommy, is this how a lazy bum looks like?
Better get up from there or I'll spank you good.
- No, mommy, no...
- l'll spank you good.
I'm going to break down.
Mother once told me that, if I can get proofs from the delivery clinic I was born in.
I can apply to stay in H.K. as a resident.
It's been so long.
The mid-wife may have died.
Billy was also born in that clinic.
There's a name card at the bottom of the drawer.
I didn't think you would still keep it.
Kwong Sun, it has been too long.
You're even prettier than your mother.
Make yourself at home.
Do stay here.
Get out of here.
Always in the way.
This is the address of the clinic.
Kwong Sun, you now know what H.K. is like.
I must take care of them and earn a living too.
I really don't have time to help you out.
Mommy, Billy has poo all over his face.
Can't you wait?
Stink...
Here's $200.
I worked my fingers off for that.
It's the best I can do.
I don't think I can do more even if I wanted to.
1997 will be here soon, why did you come here?
But I was born here.
I don't see what's so great about it.
What has that got me?
If it's not for these damn brats.
I'll head back up there myself.
Look at you.
It's all over your face and clothes.
Dirty as a rat.
Hold still and let me clean it up.
Stop crying.
Stop it. I'm not dead yet.
Shit.
Really, when I was the young bride-to-be.
I was so nervous to see my in-laws.
Now that I'm the in-law, I'm still nervous.
I'm so useless.
It must be them.
How come it's you?
I should've guessed you are Bon's girlfriend.
Please come in.
Come in.
You slept here last night?
It's really none of us old folks' business.
Just ignore I've even asked the question.
Come over here.
Sit down.
Where's Bon?
Didn't he come back with you?
He...
Cops are all alike.
They lost track of time.
I don't even know your name.
Just call me Kwong Sun.
Well then, Kwong Sun.
is it all right if I call you Aunt?
In Cheung Chau, everyone calls me Mrs. Ho.
The people from church call me Madonna.
If you consider me as one of the family.
Like Bon, you can call me mom.
Mom.
Good.
Are you hungry?
No, I'm not.
Just sit over there.
I'll get you some soup.
Go ahead.
One must eat if one is hungry.
I was starving just now.
Look here. I ate them all.
You can't tell, can you?
Let's have some soup first.
Take it.
How's the taste?
It's really good.
It doesn't matter if a woman can't raise a kid.
But it's important that she can make good soup.
Why is that so?
If a man wants to go and fool around.
He can use the need to have good soup as excuse.
He can't say he needs to go raise a kid, can he?
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
Believe me, it works everytime.
It doesn't work any other way.
Anything wrong, mom?
I'm choking.
Will that work?
Yes, this may be an old wives' tale.
But it works everytime.
It's your turn?
Keep it up.
Hurry...it will work.
How is it?
Does it work?
It works.
Of course it does.
Old remedies always work.
Let's eat some more.
What if we finish all the food?
We can always cook some more.
Bon says she's never worked a day in her life.
She's even better than I am.
I won't live with your mom when we get married.
You haven't even met her yet.
I've asked her many times to come live with me.
She has never once agreed.
Mom.
I have to use the washroom.
Terrific.
Eating before everyone else again?
This is good, mom.
Try some.
- Smart boy.
You know how to pick them.
- What?
She's such a wonderful girl.
You must have taken after your father.
Mom was just talking about you.
Mom, this is Judy.
Auntie.
Who is she?
My girlfriend.
Then, who's the one in the kitchen?
What kitchen?
Wai Hung...
Who's this woman?
There's something wrong with her mentally.
She's crazy.
I really don't know who she is.
She's nuts.
How can I be called Wai Hung?
Who is really my daughter-in-law-to-be?
Of course it's this one, mom.
Her?
Are you sure?
What are you doing?
She's not be the real thing, is she?
What real thing?
How you wish?
You're kept this woman here...
- behind my back?
- Who says?
Mrs. Ho, you do know how to bring up your son.
Teaching him to be a two-timer.
Watch it.
You might spoil him to death.
What's wrong with that?
- His father was a clock repairman.
- Right.
- He could time 10 clocks at a time.
- Right.
You can't take it?
There's other fish in the sea.
Mom, don't say that.
I'm talking to your son, you shut up.
Ask me to shut up?
I'm telling you to ship out.
Mom, Judy, I can explain.
I don't know her, she's crazy.
Wai Hung, Mrs., how's life?
You spoil everything.
What have you got to say now, Wai Hung?
I don't ever want to see you again.
Get out!
Stand still.
I've never interfered with your life before.
But choosing a wife is a big thing.
One must choose carefully.
If it's like that Judy, I won't have it.
Kwong Sun, Don't be frightened.
As long as I'm here, he can't bully you.
Come on in.
Mom.
Granny, when cousin Wai Hung and I left for H.K.
I thought our future was so bright and hopeful.
I'd never thought it would turn out like this.
Auntie Wan doesn't want me to stay with her.
But I've met this friend.
Both his mom and he treated me really well.
- Wai Hung.
- l'm not Wai Hung. I'm a trouble seeker.
I hate to bump into you.
Can't you leave me alone?
If that's too much to ask, leave my mom alone.
Let me warn you, don't get too friendly with her.
I'm sorry.
I was just talking nonsense just now.
Can't leave you alone for a minute.
All is well, get some sleep.
Let's have breakfast tomorrow before I leave.
How's the girl back home?
No thanks to you.
If she can't regain her memories ever.
You'll have to mind her the rest of her life.
Yes. I've got it all figured out for you.
It'll cost around $3,000 per month.
That much?
Around that I'll ask you for it on pay day.
You're kidding?
Who's kidding?
Look what's happening over there?
Make way.
We're the police.
What's going on?
Sir, one of our customers passed out suddenly.
Can you come and check on him?
- Calm down, let me take a look.
- Thanks.
Please co-operate and move out of the way.
Fine now, go back to work.
Sir, will that do?
Of course.
I've learnt this from St. John's.
Can't you people hear me?
I said out.
It's not working.
Sir.
His breathing is getting weak.
Will mouth to mouth resuscitation work?
- l'll give it a try.
- Thanks.
Bad breath.
It really stinks.
I can't stand it.
Get up.
What are you doing?
Stop kicking him.
He's not well.
Get up...
What are you trying to do?
Kill him?
What are you doing?
Get up.
Damn it...
You sure know how to put one on.
Let me go for old times' sake, please.
Must you do your act in such lavishing style?
I don't own all the restaurants here you know.
There's no informers' fees coming.
- And I'm broke.
- Get out of my sight.
Go...
Jerk.
Sir, how can you let him go without paying?
How much did he owe you?
I'll pay for him.
That's more like it.
Just take this money.
Still stinks?
This is useless.
I must get some insecticide.
That guy's mouth is worse than a sewer.
Really, you should have told me he's pretending.
Don't want to spoil your enthusiasm.
That bum sure is a good actor.
He could have me fooled if it's not for you.
Honey.
Can't you remember what today is?
What?
Your Birthday?
More important than my birthdays.
It's our wedding anniversary.
- For you.
- Thank you.
More coming.
Thank you...
You're welcome.
There's more...
What's this?
Open it.
is this a net?
- Negligee.
- Negligee?
For you?
- No, for you.
- l'm not wearing it.
You prefer being nude?
Fine with me.
What are you doing?
Something that'll have a result in 10 months.
I can't.
- You can't?
But I can.
Come, my darling.
- No...
My mom's not here.
We're married.
What are you afraid of?
Don't be shy.
We're husband and wife.
Come on, darling.
You don't like it here?
We'll go in the bedroom.
Let go of me...
Here I come.
Please don't. I'm not your wife.
Don't treat me as your loving husband.
Treat me as an animal.
Stop it. I'm really not your wife.
Then why do you keep saying you are before?
But I'm really not your wife. I'm not.
That I know from the start.
Who are you really?
I am sorry.
I don't want your apologies.
Who are you?
Actually, I'm a stowaway.
It's by chance that I bumped into you.
I didn't mean to deceive you.
You didn't mean to deceive me?
Calling Bon, wanted at headquarter.
Urgent.
Be there right away.
Bon, please don't arrest me.
I'll leave.
As a cop, I should have arrested you long ago.
But it's our fault that you got injured first.
I'll let you off the hook this time.
I want you gone before I come home.
Addict Hung is upstairs having treatment.
- Not putting me on again?
- No.
Go.
Both front and back doors are guarded.
But we don't know what's happening upstairs.
Send one of our men to go in as a patient.
But Hung will recognise all of us.
Yes.
He has seen me before.
Does Hung have 2 big pimples on his nose?
I can't remember.
See?
Since you can't remember how he looks like, he won't remember you neither.
We'll give you a brand new image.
Let's go.
Can I help you?
I've twisted my spinal cord, I think.
- Come in and have a seat.
- Thank you.
How did you get this?
Thanks to this book.
Those positions can really get you.
I think I've hurt my back real bad.
- Just fill out this registration form.
- Thanks.
Calling station.
Only suspect and one woman here.
Get our men ready and stand by at the front.
Are you the one twisted the spinal cord?
Yes... lt's your turn.
So soon. lsn't he first?
He's just waiting for someone.
Come in.
Crazy.
Doctor, I just...
What now?
There may be a lump in my underarms.
No problem. I'll just change needles.
- Doctor...
- Yes?
- Actually, I'm...
- What is it now?
Not only is there a lump in my underarms.
I think I have breast cancer.
Well then, we'll need a bigger needle.
No...
Help...
Ouch.
The pain.
Freeze.
Police.
Don't move.
Bad.
You've been out cold for the past 24 hours.
How did you get here?
Your mom just went home to rest this morning.
She'll come and see you again later on.
Thanks for talking care of me.
I won't bother you anymore.
Where are you going?
Mom, he's better now.
You must be tired staying up all night.
Go home and get some rest.
- Bon.
- Mom.
Mom, I must leave H.K. for a few days.
I won't have time to come over.
Take care of yourself.
Kwong Sun...
Don't say anything. I know what happened.
No matter where you are from.
I'll always consider you as my daughter-in-law.
Stay with me.
Don't cry, my child.
Bon is a good son, Let me talk to him.
What is it now, mom?
A woman knows how a woman feel.
That poor girl.
A young girl in a strange place all by herself.
She told you?
She didn't tell me anything.
I saw her letter.
She was born here you know.
All she needs is to find proofs.
Mom, I'm a policeman.
How can I keep a stowaway in my house?
Nobody will know if she doesn't go out.
Of course I can't decide.
Or else she can stay.
It all depends on you.
You do what you want.
is that a yes or a no?
What do you think?
Whatever you say mom.
Happy now?
I'm just trying to help a poor girl.
Kwong Sun... ls the person in charge here?
Anything important?
I want to have my birth certificate searched.
The owner went to Macau.
Come back next week.
Dim sum.
Tasty dim sum.
Want something, miss?
How about these?
They're fresh.
- Pay time...
- l can get paid.
- How many days have you worked?
- Seven.
That's $280.
With tips, that's...
The immigration people are here to spot check.
What should I do?
Go.
Hurry up.
What about my pay?
What?
Worry about it later.
- But my pay.
- You'll be in a mess if they caught you.
You'll get deported.
You'll get us all in trouble too.
Go...
What are you doing coming back here?
Hurry up, go.
Nice.
We have more money to spend this month.
Right on.
Want to make more money?
Hire stowaway workers.
Shut up and hand me my share.
- Mahjong?
- l'm not playing.
What do you mean?
We've said earlier that we're celebration Bon's recovery with a game.
I won't win.
You always cheat.
What?
Me cheat?
Yes.
You never wear your underwear when you play.
It's a real curse.
I know I can't.
What's the big deal?
You four go ahead.
Don't count me in.
Forget it.
Let's go.
Bye...
- Want to go see a movie?
- Fine.
- What now?
- Your wife.
- What?
- Let's see what's going on first.
We've just got rid of her.
Don't bother with her.
It might get sticky.
If she can't heck it, she'll come back.
Let's go.
I hate to be on duty when it rains.
We are soaked.
All over my pants.
Damn. I'll get you next time.
Let's find somewhere to dry off.
How about over there?
is there something I can do for you?
She's my sister.
She has moved to Canada.
I'm not sure if there are any references left.
There're appliances and files to be packaged.
They are not shipped out yet.
Do you think you can help me out?
No problem.
Why don't you write to her.
And tell her your situation?
Can you give me her address?
Of course.
Let me get it for you.
Here it is.
Thanks a lot... lt's nothing.
Write to her soon.
- l will.
Goodbye.
- Bye.
You two wait here.
I need to get some money.
Wait here for him.
I'll bring the car over.
Told you not to lay them out so far.
Sorry sir. I'll fix it right away.
I've told you many times.
Want to get arrested?
Sorry...
Miss.
What are you doing here?
I'm just waiting for some friends.
Can I see your l.D.?
Let's see some identification.
Partner, what is it?
is she your friend?
Yes.
Sorry, we're running out of time.
Stay right here.
Duty is duty.
Sorry to trouble you. l.D. please.
I told you we're in a hurry.
Excuse me. l.D. please.
Can't you just spare me the trouble?
Sorry no.
Please show your l.D.
- Haven't got it?
- What is it?
Who's bugging you?
Say what?
I suspect she doesn't have any l.D.
Sorry, l.D. please.
Come over here, partner.
I'm from Kowloon Headquarter, Triad Dept.
Listen!
No matter what you see, don't be nervous.
Stay calm.
We have received information.
There'll be 8 armed men coming to rob this bank.
Don't get nervous...
Our men are dispersed all over this area.
including those two at the back.
They can't identify themselves on the street.
How many robbers will there be, you know?
Around 8 Armed with 2 handguns and 4 rifles.
There may be hand grenades and machine guns too.
- Don't let this information out.
- l know.
Can I help you?
What can you help me?
I wanted to.
But since cadet school, I've only open fired twice.
And both times, I missed and hit on-lookers.
There's no need then.
This is a dangerous case.
Can't make any unnecessary sacrifice, right?
- Right.
- l'll leave.
Don't look around.
Stay cool.
Don't frown.
Try to whistle.
Whistling may help relax you.
Strange?
How come everyone seems to know I have no l.D.?
Of course.
Look at you.
Sure look conspicuous.
I'll take you to get some decent clothes.
Go try it on.
How do you know this place?
Judy took me here.
Watch it.
You might bump into her.
Don't be silly. lt's office hours.
How come she's here?
- Miss, Please wrap this up for me.
- Yes?
Yes.
See anything you like?
No.
Nothing fits me.
- lt's not good.
- Shut up.
I want to look at some sunglasses.
- Girls, take your time.
- Yes.
Bon, what are you doing here?
What a coincidence.
Long Man and I are looking for toilets.
- We have to go desperately.
- Yes.
is this a toilet?
So, is you.
Don't you lose your cool.
Let me explain.
I won't but I don't want your explanation. I'm leaving.
Miss Judy, please let me explain.
Slut.
- Why do you hit her?
- So what?
What do you want?
Please, stop it.
Get your hands off me or I'll yell rape.
Enough.
Look at you.
You're acting like a maniac.
Yes, I'm a maniac.
At least I'm not like her a cheap whore.
Who do you think you are?
You're just a cop.
I'm raising your standard by being seen with you.
Men like you are a dime a dozen.
But if you want to find another girlfriend like me.
Do more good deeds.
Maybe in your next life.
Find a wealthy father.
Then, you may have some hope yet.
Only men like you are worthy of women like her.
Have you said enough?
Sure.
I've hit her enough and yelled enough.
What can you do about it?
Arrest me?
I'll arrest you.
As a member of the Royal H.K. Police Force.
I am charging you for assault.
She is the victim.
I'm the eye-witness.
Don't be scared.
What's so big deal about cops?
Right.
Take them to court.
You two know this woman?
What if we do?
Then, you two are in this together?
You two may now also be charged as accomplices.
Show your l.D.
Partner, I think we need to call a big van.
Make the call now.
I don't know her well.
We'll just acquaintances.
I'm just doing my job.
Get your l.D. out.
l.D.
Forget it.
You're lucky the victim isn't pressing charges.
Can I go now?
Wait.
Legally, you can go.
But personally, I think you owe her an apology.
Me, apologising to her?
Say it.
Sorry.
Can you people hear her?
No...
Well, they can't hear you.
Sorry.
Let her go.
Why don't you answer the phone?
My ears need a rest.
Let me explain to her.
Just wait till she cools off first.
No explaining now.
She thinks we're together.
Let me shower first and we'll go eat something.
Bon, listen good. I've turned the gas on.
You better come here in 10 minutes and apologise.
Or I'll kill myself.
Please calm down, Miss Judy.
Let me tell you the whole story.
He's just being kind to take me in.
Who are you talking to?
It's Miss Judy.
Come talk to her.
She wants to kill herself.
Don't over react.
I won't.
At least my place isn't a refugee hut.
What do you mean?
That dummy told me everything.
Normally, I should feel proud.
To have such a boyfriend as kind as you.
But you really overdid it this time.
Now is my chance to make you pay.
I'm giving you ten minutes to get your ass over here.
Or I'll call the police on you.
Judy.
What did she say?
Stupid.
Why did you tell her everything?
We're in deep trouble.
What do you want?
What do I want?
Don't think I'm blackmailing you to get you back.
I won't.
I go out with you because you're not bad looking.
At least, you won't degrade me.
Thank you.
I know I'm too good and refined for you.
But still, I gave you the chance.
So that you'll feel grateful towards me.
And will obey my every command.
But you not only do you disobey me.
You even step on me.
So, I'm not giving you another chance.
It's finished between us.
Are you finished?
Stop. lf you go, I'll call the police.
I'll tell them you hid a stowaway at your place.
If you're not a woman, what you've just said... will entitle you to a good beating.
If you aqueal on me, I won't keep your secret.
I'll tell the world.
Your breasts are injected.
Jackass.
Where are you going?
Sorry to have trouble you.
I'm really grateful.
I don't want to bother you anymore.
Goodbye.
It's true you're given me a handful.
But I've given you a lot of troubles too.
I'll feel like a jerk if you go now.
Well, I've always been a jerk.
But ever since you came, I find being a jerk with you is better than being a jerk alone.
What do you say?
I am very democratic.
It's good if you stay.
If not, it's fine with me.
I've made up my mind.
I should really go.
Goodbye.
I'm not democratic at all.
I won't let you go even if you want to.
I'm serious.
You've gone through so much to get here.
All you need now is just one letter.
What if you get caught by the police?
All your efforts will be in vain.
Don't worry.
I'll take good care of myself.
Of course you know how to take care of yourself.
If both of us can take care of ourselves.
Then let us take care of ourselves together. lf...
What am I saying?
Will you stay?
Want to go for some fresh air?
- Where?
- Come.
I'm going to work now.
Don't leave the house.
Bye.
Wait.
Where do you think you're doing?
Let go of me...
Let you go?
I tried so hard to get you out here.
What have I got in return?
Look at my face.
Come out, you bitch.
What's going on?
Shut up.
Stand aside.
One word out of you and I'll kill you.
Move...
Sir, it's me.
What do you want?
Don't be uptight.
Money is all I want.
For only $30,000.
All will be well.
Where do you want to collect the money?
That was a fast decision.
Today, 3 pm.
At Kowloon Tong Rail Station.
Sir.
Where's my friend?
Don't think I'm dumb enough to bring her along.
As long as you pay me.
And I can leave in one piece.
You'll have your girl back in no time.
I'm not looking for trouble.
- Count it.
- There's no need for that.
Thank you.
One more small request.
I wonder if you'll oblige?
What?
I want to treat you to a train ride.
Fine.
- l'll see that you get aboard.
Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Bon voyage.
Hello, Wei.
- Mister.
- Yes?
- Which floor does that man live on?
- Second floor.
I'll wait for you at the front.
No one's home.
I saw him come in awhile ago.
I'll go up and check.
Mr. Ho.
There's a registered letter for you.
Are you the Mr. Ho on 1st floor, block A?
Yes.
Please sign here for your letter.
Thank you.
Thanks...
People like us do keep our word.
Since I've been paid, of course I'll let you go.
However, I can't let you have it so easy.
I'm not born gorgeous looking.
Thanks to you for this scar.
I don't think there's much hope for me left.
You've given me such an unforgettable present.
I must return the favor before letting you go.
Not so easy.
Bitch.
Go to hell.
You can't leave so easily.
Get up.
Help...
No, please...
Help me...
How pretty.
This is just the beginning.
No...
What took you?
- How are things?
- They're upstairs.
Everything is all right now.
What are you doing?
Give me back my gun...
Don't come near me.
This is no joke. lt's dangerous.
If you come near me, I'll shoot.
Don't fool around, it's dangerous.
Give me back my gun.
I'll shoot.
Taxi.
Don't move.
Are you crazy?
Sir, help me... 34587 calling station.
Don't move.
Bon.
Call an ambulance.
Bon, how are you feeling?
I am fine.
Mom took me to a fortune teller once.
He said I will live till I'm 80.
That's why I was fine from the fall last time.
I'll make it this time as well.
But if I don't pull through.
You must take care of mom and Kwong Sun for me.
I will.
Pal, don't ruin it.
Don't let me see you cry.
I won't cry.
I'll go check on the ambulance.
What are you doing?
You are a policeman.
Crying in public.
What a disgrace!
I quit.
Can I cry now?
Sir, it's a real mess down there.
I think you can get your l.D. soon.
But I don't know if I'll live to see it.
I may not make it.
No.
You will be alright.
I'm not sure if he'll be all right.
But as for you, I'm sure you won't be.
Yes.
- No...
- Check to see if the ambulance is here.
- Don't...
- Go.
Don't tear us apart, no...
Bon...
Just rest.
Get her into the car.
- Let me.
- Go down and check.
Don't worry.
Nothing will happen to Bon.
Get in the car first.
No need for the ambulance.
Call the undertaker.
What?
Undertaker?
Bon.
Get a hold of her...
What's going on?
...
Let go of me...
Stop it.
Bon...
Miss, why are you crying again?
Careful.
He's one of our men.
If it's not for that pager in your pocket, your injuries may be fatal.
It's still working.
Bon, how do you feel?
The fortune teller may be right.
It might not be time for me to go yet.
There's something I want to ask you long ago?
Do you really have a husband named Wai Hung?
He's my cousin back home.
Tell mom to bring my birth certificate along... when she comes to see me.
Why?
I'm going to change my name to Wai Hung legally.
Since both you and mom keep calling me that.
Might as well let it be.
If you wish I don't mind what name you call me.
Bon, I'm not worth your while.
What can I say to make you understand?
I am not a perfect person.
And I've never asked for perfect things.
What happened today may have marked you for life.
But, let me tell you.
In my heart you will always be the best.
Don't go...
Stop fighting.
Damn shorty, how dare you hit your superior?
You won't even let me see him for the last time.
Bon, you didn't die?
He didn't but you will.
Who are you talking to me as?
Using pressure on me as a superior again?
We'll do it man to man.
Even if you tell mom, I'll still get you.
You damn shorty...
Don't you guys help out.
I've been wanting to fix you for a long time.
Then, as your Uncle, have a slap on me.
Go tell your mommy now.
Stop the car...
Stop
You, go check over there
- See anything?
- No
They're back here
Follow them
Over there
Cousin, you better leave without me
No.
We'll go together
This is HK already.
Hurry, go
Go
I've made the call but I can't find your aunt
You're a stranger in HK, stay with me
Scared?
Let me take it out for you
Don't be scared
You are incurable
Do you have a sound reason for being transferred eleven times within only one year after you left the cadet?
You are like a human football
Did you hear what I said?
What?
If it's not because we're relatives
I'll never let you work in my district
Mom
I know
He's here
Phone call for you
Uncle, there's a phone call for you
Sister, what is it?
Watch out for my hat
Don't interrupt when your elders are talking
I'm talking to your mother
I won't be coming
I'm being bored to death by your son here
Nothing you can do can amend it
I'll tell him.
All right, bye
What did mom say?
Don't soak your athlete's foot in the tub
Your son caught the bacteria on his scalp
It's a good thing it didn't go into his eyes
Or else he'll have athlete's eyes
Shut your mouth
I have all the experienced
CIDs here
Choose one as your partner
No
I can't stand experience cops
They'll be on my back constantly
Just get me a lazy one
But one not as handsome as I am
That will be hard to find
This one is the worst.
How about it?
Good morning
Judy, you can go now
No, I want to see you go in
Fine
- Morning
- Morning
Bon, all dressed up for a modelling job?
Yes.
Playboy asks me to pose for their cover
Can't you be serious?
I didn't say anything wrong
Don't you want me as a model for your company?
Resign?
What's wrong with being a cop?
If something happens to your family
You can be sure I'll work hard on the case
If you and I are to get marry, you must quit
Then, we'll just live together
No.
I've typed up your resignation letter
How smart
There's a typing error
More
You're great
Let's go
2993
You can't come and go as you please
Being a model beats being a policeman?
Police are respected
Have you heard of models are respected?
So I want to be a policeman
I've transferred a top man to assist you
Tell 23838 to come in
When you see him, you may think I'm lying
But, don't let your eyes deceive you
Whether you're a good cop or not is genetic
In him, runs the refined blood of my family
So, you must not doubt his performance quality
Come here
Let me introduce you
This is your new partner
Long man
King Kong
What King Kong?
Ho Ting Bon
Now I know why you haven't been promoted
You talked too much
But it doesn't matter
Really?
Birds of a feather, flocked together
Now that you're partners,
I've a case for you
I hate apple polishing
So, don't give me any royal treatment
Even I'm his relative, don't do me any favours
This is Addict Hung
He may have a drug deal at 4 pm tomorrow
So, he is your uncle
Who says?
I am his uncle
My father is still young for his years
I am an accident from his old age
Did you hear what I've just said?
About Addict Hung?
He may have a drug deal at 4 pm tomorrow
Correct?
Don't you two have work to do?
Yes, sir
Taste samples, please try
The taste is great
Try some
Please try some
You've been at this 3 or 4 times already
I just want to taste it better
With so much sampling, you should know by now
How many boxes do you want?
You're not buying?
Then move
It's boiled
We've been here for 3 days
Is the info true?
True or not, we must be patient
Being a CID is hard,
I'd rather sit in office
Shoplifting
I know, but we can't identify ourselves
I'm full
Thanks
Mister
Shoplifting
Stop right there.
Police
Addict Hung, don't run
What are you doing here, go after him
Go
Why are you dragging this girl along?
She was stealing, I may get promoted from this
Just handcuffed her first
Let's go
- Did you see his car?
- No
Watch it
Let's go
Let me go
Let's check on her
No serious harm done, I'll call an ambulance
Do you want to work as a cop still?
Of course
Well then, call a taxi and get her to a hospital
If Headquarter finds out, it'll be the end of us
Thank you
You're joking?
Me-a husband?
Who'll believe it?
I'm more like her little brother
Who is the patient's husband?
Him
You are both her husbands?
I am her ex.
He's her present
What?
Correct
Her marriage to me is a mistake
Only they belong together.
They're a lovely pair
Till death do they part
- Right?
- You...
Fill out this information sheet for your wife
Come on, fill it out
Shit
What are you doing?
If Headquarter knows about this, we'll be fired
Consider my height
If I'm not a cop, how else can I bully people?
If this small pleasure is snatched away from me
What else is there left for me to live for?
Don't talk too much
I've already admitted I'm her husband
I'll bear whatever consequence there is to come
That's nice to know
If she has damaged her brain from the accident
You're in luck
To have such a beautiful wife all of a sudden
Shut up
She looks prettier by the minute
Don't sweat it I'll pass her to you for sure
Hard to find a girl with a lower IQ than yours
To match you
Let's look again to see if we can find some ID
Haven't we looked earlier?
No use talking to you
It must be hidden somewhere private
What are you doing?
Try to take advantage?
I just want to have a more thorough search
Nothing
You think she might be a stowaway?
It will be great if she is
We can immediately deport her
What should I do now?
I must continue with this pretense
She's regaining her consciousness
Miss, how do you feel?
Careful now
Wai Hung
Wai Hung?
Who's Wai Hung?
She's up
Wai Hung, don't you recognise me?
I'm your wife, Kwong Sun
What did you say?
Don't you recognize your own wife?
Start
Don't be scared, you may be in shock still
Not necessarily amnesia
Can you hear airplanes around where you live?
Can you hear them at your place?
I can't hear them
That excludes around airport
Can you see 3 huge chimneys around your house?
Can you see them at yours?
No
Then, it can't be around industrial estate
Are we questioning you or are you asking us?
Aren't your place my place as well?
How can my place be the same as your place?
If my place is your place
I would have brought you home already
What else can you remember?
Wai Hung
What does Wai Hung look like?
He looks like you
In the old movies, when the actress has amnesia
A good scare usually helps her remember
Are you crazy?
Screaming like that so suddenly?
- Where are you going?
- Wai Hung
Miss, I am really not Wai Hung
My father was an illiterate
He would never give me such a decent name
My name is Ho Ting Bon
It's not yours
ID pictures are just an approximation
I'm not your husband and you're not my wife
So, don't call me Wai Hung anymore
Just rest for awhile
What are you doing?
Come on, let's leave
What?
We got her this way.
We can't just go
She can't remember a thing.
What else can we do?
Well, we can ask her to stand on the road
Let her get run over by a car again
If she's lucky, the hit may regain her memories
If she's unlucky and died from the crash
At least we can get rid of her.
Let's go
I can't believe you can even think such things
No wonder you're so short
I'm waiting for someone.
Please come back later
Now what?
Well, to make you feel better
Let's have our Royal Majesty decide
If it's heads, we'll go.
If it's tails, we stay
Heads
This is fate.
Let's go
Well, there are letters on the head side too
I saw the 2 gentlemen left at the backdoor
What?
You want to eat without paying?
Got any money?
Pay up
What are you doing to my wife?
See?
I told you my husband won't leave me here
This is counterfeit money?
I'm sorry
Don't ever tell people I'm your husband again
Wai Hung
Where are you going, Wai Hung?
I want to do some shopping
What do you want to buy, Wai Hung?
Wai Hung is indeed a pleasant name
But my name is not Wai Hung
It's really no use telling you this, is it?
Let's play a game, all right?
What game?
It's called, My name is not Wai Hung.
That means, even if I am really your husband
Let's pretend I'm not tonight
Just treat me as a friend
When you regain your memories back
All is well if I'm really your husband
Even if I'm not, you still haven't been taken in
Then, I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
If you're not my husband,
I can't be with you
All right, we won't play this game
We'll play another game
You can treat me as your husband
I'll just pretend to have a wife tonight
I thought having a wife means I can relax
Turns out I have to sweat myself in the kitchen
The taste is not bad
Chow time
Come sit down
It smells wonderful
Not yet.
There's more
What's that?
Champagne
Bottoms up
Let me teach you another game
You're stupid, I'm stupid, he's stupid
Drink up
One more time
Apprentice overtakes the master
It's not fair
Do the dishes
Go do the dishes
What about you?
You go.
You're my wife, doing dishes is your job
You keep saying I'm not I won't do them
You can't get away with it this time.
Get up
Whoever the bottle point at will do the dishes
Fine with me
I can't believe this
Go do the dishes
All right
They're all clean now
No way.
Wash them properly
There're no such rules in this household
Let the rats clean them then
Get up.
Cheat
China City Night Club
Can I talk to the cleaning lady.
Ah Wan?
Who?
Can you speak louder?
The cleaning lady, Ah Wan
She doesn't work here anymore
Where can I reach her?
Who are you?
I'm her niece from Kwong Zhou
Please give me her address
Please wait
Thank you, go on
- Good morning
- Good morning
Sorry.
My hands are tied
This is a fat chicken.
It didn't go far
Thank you, miss
- Bye
- Bye
Rise and shine
Morning, mom
Morning still?
What brings you here so early?
My club fees are due for collection today
Why are you sleeping in the living room?
I have a friend staying in my bedroom
A friend?
Boyfriend or girlfriend?
A girlfriend
A girl?
Not that kind.
We're just friends
Of course I know it's not that kind
Or else why won't you be sleeping in there?
Strange, where is she?
Is your friend up yet?
She's gone
When are you going to bring your girl over?
How about tonight?
I'll ask her to come dinner
What are her favourite dishes?
Mom, don't you spoil her
She has a bad enough temper as it is
If you pamper her, she'll be worse
Your mom has a reputation for being nice
I know what to do
It's useless to put on a strict face
Nowadays, it's important to be easy and friendly
Go, clean up and have breakfast
Auntie Wan
Kwong Sun
You're already come to Hong Kong?
Before mom died, she did ask me to come see you
Mommy, Skinny took Billy's bottle
I don't believe this, you bad boy
Billy took my ink bottle first
You kids are all useless
Look at you Ink all over
Give me a break
Auntie Wan, can I stay at your place?
Who's here?
My sister's daughter, Kwong Sun
She wants to live here with us
Uncle
There shouldn't be any problem
Let her stay here
Sure.
Where can she sleep?
Just shut your big mouth
Any rice left?
I left it on the stove.
Go get it yourself
All you do is eat and sleep
What a lazy bum
I must eat if I'm hungry
Mommy, is this how a lazy bum looks like?
Better get up from there or I'll spank you good
No, mommy, no
I'm going to break down
Mother once told me that if I can get proofs
From the delivery clinic
I was born in
I can apply to stay in HK as a resident
It's been so long
The mid-wife may have died
Billy was also born in that clinic
There's a name card at the bottom of the drawer
I didn't think you would still keep it
Kwong Sun, it has been too long
You're even prettier that your mother
Make yourself at home
Do stay here
Get out of here.
Always in the way
This is the address of the clinic
Kwong Sun, You now know
- what HK is like
- Mommy, Billy is pooing everywhere
Coming
I must take care of them and earn a living too
I really don't have time to help you out
Mommy, Billy has poo all over his face
Can't you wait?
Stink
Here's $200
I worked my fingers off for that
It's the best I can do
I don't think I can do more even if I wanted to 1 997 will be here soon
Why did you come here?
But I was born here
I don't see what's so great about it
What has that got me?
If it's not for these damn brats
I'll head back up there myself
Look at you.
It's all over your face and clothes
Dirty as a rat
Hold still and let me clean it up
Stop crying
Stop it, I'm not dead yet
Shit
Really, when I was the young bride-go-be
I was so nervous to see my in-laws
Now that I'm the in-law, I'm still nervous
I'm so useless
It must be them
How come it's you?
I should've guessed you are Bon's girlfriend
Please come in.
Come in
You slept here last night?
It's really none of us old folks' business
Just ignore I've even asked the question
Come over here
Sit down
Where's Bon?
Didn't he come back with you?
He...
Cops are all alike
They lost track of time
I don't even know your name
Just call me Kwong Sun
Well then, Kwong Sun
Is it all right it I call you Aunt?
In Cheung Chau, everyone calls me Mrs Ho
The people from church call me Madonna
If you consider me as one of the family
Like Bon, you can call me mom
Mom
Good.
Are you hungry?
No, I'm not
Just sit over there.
I'll get you some soup
Go ahead.
One must eat if one is hungry
I was starving just now.
Look here
I ate them all
You can't tell, can you?
Let's have some soup first
Take it
How's the taste?
It's really good
It doesn't matter if a woman can't raise a kid
But it's important that she can make good soup
Why is that so?
If a man wants to go and fool around
He can use the need to have good soup as excuse
He can't say he needs to go raise a kid, can he?
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach
Believe me, it works everytime
It doesn't work any other way
Anything wrong, mom?
I'm choking
Will that work?
Yes, this may be an old wives' tale
But is works everytime
It's your turn?
Keep it up
Hurry
It will work
How is it?
Does it work?
Does it work?
It works
Of course it does.
Old remedies always work
Let's eat some more
What if we finish all the food?
We can always cook some more
Bon says she's never worked a day in her life
She's even better than I am
I won't live with your mom when we get married
You haven't even met her yet
I've asked her many times to come live with me
She has never once agreed
Mom
I have to use the washroom
Terrific
Eating before everyone else again?
This is good mom.
Try some
Smart boy.
You do know how to pick them
What?
She's such a wonderful girl
You must have taken after your father
Mom was just talking about you
Mom, this is Judy
Auntie
Who is she?
My girlfriend
Then, who's the one in the kitchen?
What kitchen?
Wai Hung
Who's this woman?
There's something wrong with her mentally
I don't even know her
She's crazy
I really don't know who she is
She's nuts
How can I be called Wai Hung?
Who is really my daughter-in-law-to-be?
Of course it's this one, mom
Her?
Are you sure?
What are you doing?
She's not the real thing, is she?
What real thing?
How you wish?
You've kept this woman here behind my back?
Who says?
Mrs Ho, you do know how to bring up your son
Teaching him to be a two-timer
Watch it.
You might spoil him to death
What's wrong with that?
- His father was a clock repairman
- Right
He could time 1 0 clocks at once if he wanted to
That's right
You can't take it?
There's other fish in the sea
Mom, don't say that
I'm talking to your son
You shut up
Ask me to shut up?
I'm telling you to ship out
Mom
Judy
Judy, I can explain
I don't know her
She's crazy
Wai Hung, Mrs, how's life?
You spoil everything
What have you got to say now, Wah Hung?
I don't ever want to see you again
Get out
Stand still
I've never interfered with your life before
But choosing a wife is a big thing
One must choose careful?
If it's like that Judy,
I won't have it
Kwong Sun
Don't be frightened
As long as I'm here, he can't bully you
Come on in
Mom
Granny, when cousin Wai Hung
IleftforHK
I thought our future was so bright and hopeful
I'd never thought it would turn out like this
Auntie Wan doesn't want me to stay with her
But I've met this friend
Both him mom and he treated me really well
Wai Hung
My name isn't Wai Hung.
I'm a trouble seeker
I hate to bump into you
Can't you leave me alone?
If that's too much to ask, leave my mom alone
Let me warn you, don't get too friendly with her
I'm sorry, I was just talking nonsense just now
Can't leave you alone for a minute
All is well, get some sleep
Let's have breakfast tomorrow before I leave
How's the girl back home?
No thanks to you
If she can't regain her memories ever
You'll have to mind her the rest of her life
Yes, I've got it all figured out for you
It'll cost around $3,000 per month
That much?
Around that
I'll ask you for it on pay day
You're kidding?
Who's kidding?
Look what's happening over there?
Make way.
We're the police
- Police.
- Make way
What's going on?
Sir, one of our customers passed out suddenly
Can you come and check on him?
Calm down, let me take a look
Thanks
Please co-operate and move out of the way
Fine now, go back to work
Sir, will that do?
Of course.
I've learnt this from St John's
Can't you people hear me?
I said out
It's not working.
Sir
His breathing is getting weak
Will mouth to mouth resuscitation work?
I'll give it a try
Thanks
Bad breath
It really stinks
I can't stand it
Get up
What are you doing?
Stop kicking him.
He's not well
Get up
What are you trying to do?
Kill him?
What is it?
What are you doing?
What?
Get up
Damn it.
You sure know how to put one on
Let me go for old times' sake, please
Must you do your act in such lavishing style?
I don't own all the restaurants here you know
I'm broke and there's no informers' fees coming
Get out of my sight
Go
Jerk
Sir, how can you let him go without paying?
How much did he owe you?
I'll pay for him
That's more like it
Just take this money
Still stinks?
This is useless.
I must get some insecticide
That guy's mouth is worse than a sewer
Really, you should have told me he's pretending
Don't want to spoil your enthusiasm
That bum sure is a good actor
He could have me fooled if it's not for you
Honey
Can't you remember what today is?
What?
Your birthday?
More important than birthdays
It's our wedding anniversary
For you
Thank you
More coming
Thank you
You're welcome.
There's more...
What's this?
Open it
Is this a net?
Negligee
Negligee?
For you?
No, for you
I'm not wearing it
You prefer being nude?
Fine with me
What are you doing?
Something that'll have a result in 1 0 months
I can't
You can't?
But I can
Come, my darling wife
My mom's not here
We're married.
What are you afraid of?
Don't be shy.
We're husband and wife
Come on, darling
You don't like it here?
We'll go in the bedroom
Come on
Let go of me
Here I come
Please don't.
I'm not your wife
Don't treat me as your loving husband
Treat me as an animal
Stop it.
I'm really not your wife
Then why do you keep saying you are before?
But I'm really not your wife.
I'm not
That I know from the start.
Who are you really?
I am sorry
I don't want your apologies.
Who are you?
Actually, I'm a stowaway
It's by chance that I bumped into you
I didn't mean to deceive you
You didn't mean to deceive me?
Calling Bon.
Wanted at headquarter.
Urgent
Be there right away
Bon, please don't arrest me
I'll leave
As a cop, I should have arrested you long ago
But it's our fault that you got injured first
I'll let you off the hook this time
I want you gone before I come home
Addict Hung is upstairs having treatment
Not putting me on again?
No
Go
Both front and back doors are guarded
But we don't know what's happening upstairs
Send one of our men to go in as a patient
But Hung will recognize all of us
Yes
He has seen me before
Does Hung have 2 big pimples on his nose?
I can't remember
See?
Since you can't remember how he looks like
He won't remember you neither
We'll give you a brand new image
Let's go
Can I help you?
I've twisted my spinal cord, I think
Come in and have a seat
Thank you
How did you get this?
Thanks to this book
Those positions can really get you
I think I've hurt my back real bad
Just fill out this registration form
Thanks
Calling station
Only suspect one woman here
Get our men ready and stand by at the front
Are you the one twisted the spinal cord?
Yes
It's your turn
So soon.
Isn't he first?
He's just waiting for someone.
Come in
OK
Crazy
What now?
There may be a lump in my underarms
No problem.
I'll just change needles
- Doctor
- Yes?
Actually, I'm...
What is it now?
Not only is there a lump in my underarms
I think I have breast cancer
Well then, we'll need a bigger needle
No.
Help
Ouch.
The pain
Freeze.
Police
Bad
You've been out cold for the past 24 hours
How did you get here?
Your mom just went home to rest this morning
She'll come and see you again later on
Thanks for taking care of me
I won't bother you anymore
Where are you going?
Mom, he's better now
You must be tired staying up all night
Go home and get some rest
Bon
Mom
Mom, I must leave HK for a few days
I won't have time to come over
Take care of yourself
Kwong Sun
Don't say anything.
I know what happened
No matter where you are from
I'll always consider you as my daughter-in-law
Stay with us
Don't cry, my child
Bon is a good son
Let me talk to him
What is it now, mom?
A woman knows how a woman feel
That poor girl
A young girl in a strange place all by herself
She told you?
She didn't tell me anything.
I saw her letter
She was born here you know
All she needs is to find proofs
Mom, I'm a policeman
How can I keep a stowaway in my house?
Nobody will know if she doesn't go out
Of course I can't decide
Or else she can stay
It all depends on you
What do you say?
Is that a yes or a no?
What do you think?
Whatever you say mom.
Happy now?
I'm just trying to help a poor girl
Kwong Sun
Is the person in charge here?
Anything important?
I want to have my birth certificate searched
The owner went to Macau
Come back next week
Dim sum.
Tasty dim sum
Want something, miss?
How about these?
They're fresh
Pay time
I can get paid
How many days have you worked?
Seven
That's $280
With tips, that's...
The immigration people are here to spot check
What should I do?
Go
Hurry up
What about my pay?
What?
Worry about it later
Hurry up, go
You'll be in a mess if they caught you
You'll get deported
What are you doing coming back here?
Hurry up, go
Hurry up
Nice
We have more money to spend this month
Right on
Want to make more money?
Hire stowaway workers
Shut up and hand me my share
Mahjong?
I'm not playing
What do you mean?
We've said earlier that we're celebration
Bon's recovery with a game
Right
I won't win.
You always cheat
What?
Me cheat?
Yes
You never wear you undies when you play
It's a real curse
I know I can't.
What's the big deal?
You four go ahead
Don't count me in
Forget it
Let's go
Bye
Want to go see a movie?
Fine
What now?
Your wife
What?
Let's see what's going on first
We've just got rid of her.
Don't bother with her
If she can't heck it, she'll come back
Let's go
I hate to be on duty when it rains
We are soaked
All over my pants
Damn
I'll get you next time
Let's find somewhere to dry off
How about over there?
Anywhere
Is there something.
I can do for you?
She's my sister
She has moved to Canada
I'm not sure if there are any references left
There're appliances and files to be packaged
They are not shipped out yet
Do you think you can help me out?
No problem
Why don't you write to her and tell her your situation?
Can you give me her address?
Of course.
Let me get it for you
Here it is
Thanks a lot
It's nothing.
Write to her soon
I will.
Goodbye
You two wait here
I need to get some money
Sure
Wait here for him.
I'll bring the car over
Told you not to lay them out so far
Sorry sir.
I'll fix it right away
I've told you many times
Want to get arrested?
Sorry
Miss
What are you doing here?
I'm just waiting for some friends
Can I see your ID?
Let's see some identification
Sorry
Partner, what is it?
Is she your friend?
Yes.
Sorry, we're running out of time
Stay right here
Duty is duty
Sorry to trouble you ID please
I told you we're in a hurry
Excuse me.
ID please
Can't you just spare me the trouble?
Sorry no.
Please show your ID
Haven't got it?
What is it?
Who's bugging you?
Say what?
I suspect she doesn't have any ID
Sorry, ID please
Come over here, partner
I'm from Kowloon Headquarter, Triad Dept
Listen
No matter what you see, don't be nervous
Stay calm
We have received information
There'll be 8 armed men coming to rob this bank
Don't get nervous
Our men are dispersed all over this area
Including those two at the bank
They can't identify themselves on the street
How many robbers will there be, you know?
Around 8.
Armed with 2 handguns and 4 rifles
There may be hand grenades and machine guns too
Don't let this information out
I know
Can I help you?
What can you help me?
I wanted to, but since cadet school
I've only open fired twice
And both times, I missed and hit on-lookers
There's no need then.
This is a dangerous case
Can't make any unnecessary sacrifice, right?
- Right
- I'll leave
Don't look around
Stay cool
Don't frown.
Try to whistle
Whistling may help relax you
Strange?
How come everyone seems to know
I have no ID?
Of course.
Look at you
Sure look conspicuous
I'll take you to get some decent clothes
Go try it on
How do you know this place?
Judy took me here
Watch it.You might bump into her
Don't be silly.
It's office hours
How come she's here?
Miss
Please wrap this up for me
Yes
See anything you like?
No.
Nothing fits me
It's not good
Shut up
I want to look at some sunglasses
Girl, take your time
Yes
Bon, what are you doing here?
What a coincidence
Long Man and I are looking for toilets
We have to go desperately
Yes
Is this a toilet?
So, is you
Don't you lose your cool.
Let me explain
I won't but I don't want your explanation
I'm leaving
Miss Judy, please let me explain
Slut
Why do you hit her?
So what?
What do you want?
Please, stop it
Get your hands off me or I'll yell rape
Enough.
Look at you
You're acting like a maniac
Yes, I'm a maniac
At least I'm not like her a cheap whore
Who do you think you are?
You're just a cop
I'm raising your standard by being seen with you
Men like you are a dime a dozen
But if you want to find another girlfriend like me
Do more good deeds
Maybe in your next life, find a wealthy father
Then, you may have some hope yet
Only men like you are worthy of women like her
Have you said enough?
Sure.
I've hit her enough and yelled enough
What can you do about it?
Arrest me?
I'll arrest you
As a member of the Royal HK Police Force
I am charging you for assault
She is the victim
I'm the eye-witness
Don't be scared.
What's so big deal about cops?
Right.
Take them to court
You two know this woman?
What if we do?
Then, you two are in this together?
You two may now also be charged as accomplices
Show your IDs
Partner, I think we need to call a big van
Make the call now
I don't know her well
We'll just acquaintances
I'm just doing my job.
Get your IDs out
IDs
Forget it
You're lucky the victim isn't pressing charges
Can I go now?
Wait
Legally, you can go
But personally, I think you owe her an apology
Me, apologising to her?
Say it
Sorry
Can you people here her?
No
Well, they can't hear you
Sorry
Let her go
Why don't you answer the phone?
My ears need a rest
Let me explain to her
Just wait till she cools off first
No explaining now
She thinks we're together
Let me shower first and we'll go eat something
Bon, listen good.
I've turned the gas on
You better come here in 1 0 minutes and apologise
Or I'll kill myself
Please calm down, Miss Judy
Let me tell you the whole story
He's just being kind to take me in
Who are you talking to?
It's Miss Judy
Come talk to her.
She wants to kill herself
Don't over react
I won't
At least my place isn't a refugee hut
What do you mean?
That dummy told me everything
Normally, I should feel proud
To have such a boyfriend as kind as you
But you really overdid it this time
Now is my chance to make you pay
I'm giving you ten minutes
To get your ass over here
Or I'll call the police on you
Judy
What did she say?
Stupid
Why did you tell her everything?
We're in deep trouble
What do you want?
What do I want?
Don't think I'm blackmailing you to get you back
I won't
I go out with you because you're not bad looking
At least, you won't degrade me
Thank you
I know I'm too good and refined for you
But still, I gave you the chance
So that you'll feel grateful towards me
And will obey my every command
But you...
Not only do you disobey me, you even step on me
So, I'm not giving you another chance
It's finished between us
Are you finished?
Stop.
If you go, I'll call the police
I'll tell them you hid a stowaway at your place
If you're not a woman, what you've just said
Will entitle you to a good beating
If you squeal on me,
I won't keep your secret
I'll tell the world your breasts are injected
Jackass
Where are you going?
Sorry to have troubled you I'm really grateful
I don't want to bother you anymore, Goodbye
It's true you've given me a handful
But I've given you a lot of troubles too
I'll feel like a jerk if you go now
Well, I've always been a jerk
But ever since you came,
I find being a jerk
With you is better than being a jerk alone
What do you say?
I am very democratic
It's good if you stay If not, it's fine with me
I've made up my mind.
I should really go
Goodbye
I'm not democratic at all
I won't let you go even if you want to
I'm serious
You've gone through so much to get here
All you need now is just one letter
What if you get caught by the police?
All your efforts will be in vain
Don't worry.
I'll take good care of myself
Of course you know how to take care of yourself
If both of us can take care of ourselves
Then let us take care of ourselves together
If...
What am I saying?
Will you stay?
Want to go for some fresh air?
Where?
Come
"We danced at one fine night"
"Your smile circled around"
"I was delighted"
"And I got slightly drunk"
"I wish we would be in love forever"
"I wish I could stay with you every night"
"I wish I could sleep with you"
"Love is like an eternal flame"
"I will remember every moment"
"My heart was broken when we departed"
"I miss you"
"after we are apart"
"I wish we would be in love forever"
"I wish I could kiss you"
"I wish I could sleep with you"
"Love is like an eternal flame"
"Burning ever and forever"
I'm going to work now, Don't leave the house
Bye
Wait
Where do you think you're doing?
Let go of me
Let you go?
I tired so hard to get you out here
What have I got in return?
Look at my face
Come out, you bitch
What's going on?
Shut up.
Stand aside
One word out of you and I'll kill you
Move
Sir, it's me
What do you want?
Don't be uptight
Money is all I want
For only $30,000
All will be well
Where do you want to collect the money?
That was a fast decision
Today, 3pm at Kowloon Tong Rail Station
Sir
Where's my friend?
Don't think I'm dumb enough to bring her along
As long as you pay me
And I can leave in one piece
You'll have your girl back in no time
I'm not looking for trouble
Count it
There's no need for that.
Thank you
One more small request
Wonder if you'll oblige?
What?
I want to treat you to a train ride
Fine
I'll see to it that you get aboard
Bye
Bon voyage
Hello, Wei
Mister
Yes?
Which floor does that man live on?
Second floor
I'll wait for you at the front
No one's home
I saw him come in awhile ago
I'll go up and check
Mr Ho.
There's a registered letter for you
Are you the Mr Ho on 1 st floor, block A?
Yes
Please sign here for your letter
Thank you
Thanks
People like us do keep our word
Since I've been paid, of course I'll let you go
However, I can't let you have it so easy
I'm not born gorgeous looking
Thanks to you for this scar
I don't think there's much hope for me left
You've given me such an unforgettable present
I must return the favour before letting you go
Not so easy
Bitch
Go to hell
You can't leave so easily
Get up
Help
No, please
Help me
How pretty
This is just the beginning
What took you?
- How are things?
- They're upstairs
Are you blind?
Everything is all right now
What are you doing?
Give me back my gun
Don't come near me
This is no joke.
It's dangerous
If you come near me, I'll shoot
Get out of my way
Don't fool around, it's dangerous
Give me back my gun, come on
I'll shoot
Taxi
Don't move
Are you crazy?
What's going on?
Sir, help me
What's wrong?
Help
34587 calling station
Don't move
Bon
Call an ambulance
Bon, how are you feeling?
I am fine
Mom took me to a fortune teller once
He said I will live till I'm 80
That's why I was fine from the fall last time
I'll make it this time as will
But if I don't pull through
You must take care of mom and Kwong Sun for me
I will
Pal, don't ruin it
Don't let me see you cry
I won't cry
I'll go check on the ambulance
What are you doing?
You are a policeman
Crying in public
What a disgrace
I quit.
Can I cry now?
Sir, it's a real mess down there
I think you can get your ID soon
But I don't know if I'll live to see it
I may not make it
No.
You will be alright
I'm not sure if he'll be all right
But as for you, I'm sure you won't be
Yes
No
Check to see if the ambulance is here
Let me go
Go
Don't
Go
Just rest
Get her into the car
Let me
Go down and check
Don't worry.
Nothing will happen to Bon
Get in the car first
No need for the ambulance.
Call the undertaker
What?
Undertaker?
Bon
Get a hold of her
What's going on?
Let go of me
Stop it
Bon
Miss, why are you crying again?
Careful.
He's one of our men
If it's not for that pager in your pocket
Your injuries may be fatal
It's still working
Bon, how do you feel?
The fortune teller may be right
It might not be time for me to go yet
There's something I want to ask you long ago
Do you really have a husband named Wai Hung?
He's my cousin back home
Tell mom to bring my birth certificate along
When she comes to see me
Why?
I'm going to change my name to Wai Hung legally
Since both you and mom keep calling me that
Might as well let it be
If you wish
I don't mind
Bon, I'm not worth your while
What can I say to make you understand?
I am not a perfect person
And I've never asked for perfect things
What happened today may have marked you for life
But, let me tell you
In my heart you will always be the best
Don't you go
Don't go
Stop fighting
Damn shorty.
How dare you hit your superior
You won't even let me see him for the last time
Bon, you didn't die?
He didn't but you will
Who are you talking to me as?
Using pressure on me as a superior again?
We'll do it man to man
Even if you tell mom, I'll still get you
You damn shorty
Don't you guys help out
I've been wanting to fix you for a long time
Then, as your Uncle
Have a slap on me
Go tell your mommy now
Stop the car
Stop it
Stop.
- You, go check over there
- Go...
- See anything?
- No.
They're back here.
Follow them.
Over there...
Cousin, you better leave without me.
No.
We'll go together.
This is H.K. already.
Hurry, go.
I've made the call but I can't find your aunt.
You're a stranger in H.K., stay with me.
Scared?
Let me take it out for you.
Don't be scared...
You are incurable.
Do you have a sound reason for being transferred eleven times... within only one year after you left the cadet?
You are like a human football.
Did you hear what I said?
What?
If it's not because we're relatives.
I'll never let you work in my district.
Mom, I know.
He's here.
Phone call for you...
Uncle, there's a phone call for you.
- Sister, What is it?
- Watch out for my hat.
Don't interrupt when your elders are talking.
I'm talking to your mother.
I won't be coming.
I'm being bored to death by your son here.
Nothing you can do can amend it.
I'll tell him.
All right, bye.
What did mom say?
Don't soak your "athlete's foot" in the tub.
Your son caught the bacteria on his scalp.
It's a good thing it didn't go into his eyes.
Or else he'll have "athlete's eyes"
Shut your mouth.
I have all the experienced C.l.D. here.
Choose one as your partner.
No.
I can't stand experienced cops.
They'll be on my back constantly.
Just get me a lazy one.
But one not as handsome as I am.
That will be hard to find.
This one is the worst, How about it?
Good morning.
Judy, you can go now.
No, I want to see you go in.
Fine.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Bon, all dressed up for a modeling job?
Yes.
Playboy asks me to pose for their cover.
Can't you be serious?
I didn't say anything wrong.
Don't you want me as a model for your company?
Resign?
What's wrong with being a cop?
If something happens to your family, you can be sure I'll work hard on the case.
If you want to marry with me, you must quit.
Then, we'll just live together.
No. I've typed up your resignation letter.
How smart.
There's a typing error.
More.
- You're great.
- Let's go.
2993, you can't come and go as you please.
Being a model beats being a policeman?
Police are respected.
Have you heard of models are respected?
So I want to be a policeman.
I've transferred a top man to assist you.
Tell 23838 to come in.
When you see him, you may think I'm lying.
But, don't let your eyes deceive you.
Whether you're a good cop or not is genetic.
In him, runs the refined blood of my family.
So, you must not doubt his performance quality.
Come here...
Let me introduce you.
This is your new partner.
Long man.
King Kong.
What King Kong?
Ho Ting Bon.
Now I know why you haven't been promoted.
You talked too much.
But it doesn't matter, I like your style.
- Really?
- Birds of feather, flocked together.
Now that you're partners.
I've a case for you.
I hate apple polishing.
So, don't give me any royal treatment.
Even I'm his relative, don't do me any favours.
This is "Addict Hung".
He may have a drug deal at 4 pm tomorrow.
So, he is your uncle.
Who says?
I am his uncle.
My father is still young for his years.
I am an accident from his old age.
Did you hear what I've just said?
About "Addict Hung"?
He may have a drug deal at 4 pm tomorrow.
Correct?
- Don't you two have work to do?
- Yes, sir.
- Taste sample, please try.
- The taste is great.
Try some...
Try some.
You're been at this 3 or 4 times already.
I just want to taste it better.
With so much sampling, you should know by now.
How many boxes do you want?
You're not buying?
Then move... lt's boiled.
We've been here for 3 days.
is the information true?
True or not, we must be patient.
Being a C.l.D. is hard, I'd rather sit in office.
Shoplifting.
I know, but we can't identify ourselves.
I'm full.
Mister.
Shoplifting?
Stop right there.
Police!
Addict Hung, don't run.
What are you doing here?
Go after him.
Go...
Why are you dragging this girl along?
She was stealing, I may get promoted from this.
Just handcuffed her first.
Let's go.
- Did you see his car?
- No.
Run!
Let me go.
Let's check on her.
No serious harm done, I'll call an ambulance.
- You want to work as a cop still?
- Of course.
Well then, call a taxi and get her to a hospital.
If Headquarter finds out, it'll be the end of us.
Thank you.
You're joking?
I'm her husband?
Who'll believe it?
- There's no difference.
- l'm more like her little brother.
Who is the patient's husband?
- Him.
- Him.
Are you both her husband?
I am her ex., He's her present.
- What?
- Correct.
Her marriage to me is a mistake.
Only they belong together.
They're a lovely pair.
Till death do they part.
Right?
Fill out this information sheet for your wife.
Come on, fill it out.
If Headquarter knows about this, we'll be fired.
Consider my height.
If I'm not a cop, how else can I bully people?
If this small pleasure is snatched away from me.
What else is there left for me to live for?
Don't talk too much.
I've already admitted I'm her husband.
- l'll bear whatever consequence there's.
- That's nice to know.
If she has damaged her brain from the accident.
You're in luck.
- To have such a beautiful wife.
- Shut up.
- She looks prettier the minute.
- l'll pass her to you for sure.
Hard to find a girl with a lower lQ than yours.
Let's look again to see if we can find some l.D.
Haven't we looked earlier?
No use talking to you.
It must be hidden somewhere private.
What are you doing?
Try to take advantage?
I just want to have a more thorough search.
Nothing.
You think she might be a stowaway?
It will be great if she is, we can immediately deport her.
What should I do now?
I must continue with this pretence.
She's regaining her consciousness.
Miss, how do you feel?
Careful now.
Wai Hung.
Wai Hung?
Who is Wai Hung?
She's up.
Wai Hung, don't you recognise me?
I'm your wife, Kwong Sun.
What did you say?
Don't you recognise your own wife?
Start.
Don't be scared, you may be in shock still.
Not necessarily amnesia.
Can you hear airplanes around where you live?
Can you hear them at your place?
I can't hear them.
I can't hear them too.
That excludes around airport.
Can you see 3 huge chimneys around your house?
- Can you see them at yours?
- No.
No.
Then, it can't be around industrial estate.
Are we questioning you or are you asking us?
Aren't your place my place as well?
How can my place be the same as your place?
If my place is your place, I would have brought you home already.
What else can you remember?
- Wai Hung.
- What does Wai Hung look like?
He looks like you.
In the old movies, when the actress has amnesia.
A good scare usually helps her remember.
Are you crazy?
Screaming like that so suddenly?
- Where are you going?
- Wai Hung.
Miss, I am really not Wai Hung.
My father was an illiterate.
He would never give me such a decent name.
My name is Ho Ting Bon.
It's not yours.
l.D. pictures are just an approximation.
I'm not your husband and you're not my wife.
So, don't call me Wai Hung any more.
Just rest for awhile.
What are you doing?
Come on, let's leave.
What?
We got her this way, We can't just go.
She can't remember a thing.
What else can we do?
Well, we can ask her to stand on the road.
Let her get run over by a car again.
If she's lucky, the hit may regain her memories.
If she's died from the crash at least we can get rid of her.
Let's go.
I can't believe you can even think such things.
No wonder you're so short.
I'm waiting for someone.
Please come back later.
- Now what?
- Well, to make you feel better.
Let's have our Royal Majesty decide.
If it's heads, we'll go.
If it's tail, we stay.
Heads.
This is fate.
Let's go.
Well, there are letters on the head side too.
I saw the 2 gentlemen left at the backdoor.
What?
You want to eat without paying?
What are you doing to my wife?
See?
I told you my husband won't leave me here.
This is counterfeit money?
I'm sorry...
Don't ever tell people I'm your husband again.
Yes, Wai Hung.
Where are we going, Wai Hung?
I want to do some shopping.
What do you want to buy, Wai Hung?
Wai Hung is indeed a pleasant name.
But my name is not Wai Hung.
It's really no use telling you this, is it?
Let's play a game, all right?
What game?
It's called, "My name is not Wai Hung".
That name, even if I am really your husband.
Let's pretend I'm not tonight.
Just treat me as a friend.
When you regain your memories back, all is well if I'm really your husband.
Even if I'm not, you still haven't been taken in.
- Then, I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?
If you're not my husband, I can't be with you.
All right, we won't play this game.
We'll play another game.
You can treat me as your husband.
I'll just pretend to have a wife tonight.
I thought having a wife means I can relax.
Turns out I have to sweat myself in the kitchen.
The taste is not bad.
Chow time.
Come sit down.
It smells wonderful.
- Not yet.
There's more.
- What's that?
Champagne.
Bottoms up.
Let me teach you another game.
You're stupid, I'm stupid, he's stupid...
You're stupid, I'm stupid, he's stupid...
Drink up.
One more time.
Apprentice overtakes the master.
It's not fair.
Do the dishes...
What about you?
You go.
You're my wife, doing dishes is your job.
You keep saying I'm not. I won't do them.
You can't get away with it this time.
Get up.
Whoever the bottle points at will do the dishes.
Fine with me.
- l can't believe this.
- Go do the dishes.
All right.
They're all clean now.
No way.
Wash them properly.
There're no such rules in this household.
Let the rats clean them then.
Get up.
Cheat.
China City Night Club.
Can I talk to the cleaning lady "Ah Wan"?
Who?
Can you speak louder?
The cleaning lady, "Ah Wan".
She doesn't work here anymore.
Where can I reach her?
Who are you?
I'm her niece from Kwong Zhou.
Please give me her address.
Please wait.
Thank you, go on.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Sorry.
My hands are tied.
This is a fat chicken. lt didn't go far.
Thank you, miss.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Rise and shine.
Morning, mom.
Morning still?
What brings you here so early?
My club fees are due for collection today.
Why are you sleeping in the living room?
I have a friend staying in my bedroom.
A friend?
Boyfriend or girlfriend?
A girlfriend.
A girl?
Not that kind.
We're just friends.
Of course I know it's not that kind.
Or else why won't you be sleeping in there?
Strange, where is she?
is your friend up yet?
She's gone.
When are you going to bring your girl over?
How about tonight?
I'll ask her to come for dinner.
What are her favourite dishes?
Mom, don't you spoil her.
She has a bad enough temper as it is.
If you pamper her, she'll be worse.
Your mom has a reputation for being nice.
I know what to do.
It's useless to put on a strict face.
Nowadays, it's important to be easy and friendly.
Go, clean up and have breakfast.
Auntie Wan.
Kwong Sun.
You've already come to Hong Kong?
Before mom died, she did ask me to come see you.
Mommy, Skinny took Billy's bottle.
I don't believe this, you bad boy.
Billy took my ink bottle first.
You kids are all useless.
Look at you. lnk all over.
Auntie Wan, can I stay at your place?
- Who's here?
- My sister's daughter, Kwong Sun.
She wants to live here with us.
Uncle.
There shouldn't be any problem.
Let her stay here.
Sure.
Where can she sleep?
Just shut your big mouth.
Any rice left?
I left it on the stove.
Go get it yourself.
All you do is eat and sleep.
What a lazy bum.
I must eat if I'm hungry.
Mommy, is this how a lazy bum looks like?
Better get up from there or I'll spank you good.
- No, mommy, no...
- l'll spank you good.
I'm going to break down.
Mother once told me that, if I can get proofs from the delivery clinic I was born in.
I can apply to stay in H.K. as a resident.
It's been so long.
The mid-wife may have died.
Billy was also born in that clinic.
There's a name card at the bottom of the drawer.
I didn't think you would still keep it.
Kwong Sun, it has been too long.
You're even prettier than your mother.
Make yourself at home.
Do stay here.
Get out of here.
Always in the way.
This is the address of the clinic.
Kwong Sun, you now know what H.K. is like.
I must take care of them and earn a living too.
I really don't have time to help you out.
Mommy, Billy has poo all over his face.
Can't you wait?
Stink...
Here's $200.
I worked my fingers off for that.
It's the best I can do.
I don't think I can do more even if I wanted to.
1997 will be here soon, why did you come here?
But I was born here.
I don't see what's so great about it.
What has that got me?
If it's not for these damn brats.
I'll head back up there myself.
Look at you.
It's all over your face and clothes.
Dirty as a rat.
Hold still and let me clean it up.
Stop crying.
Stop it. I'm not dead yet.
Shit.
Really, when I was the young bride-to-be.
I was so nervous to see my in-laws.
Now that I'm the in-law, I'm still nervous.
I'm so useless.
It must be them.
How come it's you?
I should've guessed you are Bon's girlfriend.
Please come in.
Come in.
You slept here last night?
It's really none of us old folks' business.
Just ignore I've even asked the question.
Come over here.
Sit down.
Where's Bon?
Didn't he come back with you?
He...
Cops are all alike.
They lost track of time.
I don't even know your name.
Just call me Kwong Sun.
Well then, Kwong Sun.
is it all right if I call you Aunt?
In Cheung Chau, everyone calls me Mrs. Ho.
The people from church call me Madonna.
If you consider me as one of the family.
Like Bon, you can call me mom.
Mom.
Good.
Are you hungry?
No, I'm not.
Just sit over there.
I'll get you some soup.
Go ahead.
One must eat if one is hungry.
I was starving just now.
Look here. I ate them all.
You can't tell, can you?
Let's have some soup first.
Take it.
How's the taste?
It's really good.
It doesn't matter if a woman can't raise a kid.
But it's important that she can make good soup.
Why is that so?
If a man wants to go and fool around.
He can use the need to have good soup as excuse.
He can't say he needs to go raise a kid, can he?
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
Believe me, it works everytime.
It doesn't work any other way.
Anything wrong, mom?
I'm choking.
Will that work?
Yes, this may be an old wives' tale.
But it works everytime.
It's your turn?
Keep it up.
Hurry...it will work.
How is it?
Does it work?
It works.
Of course it does.
Old remedies always work.
Let's eat some more.
What if we finish all the food?
We can always cook some more.
Bon says she's never worked a day in her life.
She's even better than I am.
I won't live with your mom when we get married.
You haven't even met her yet.
I've asked her many times to come live with me.
She has never once agreed.
Mom.
I have to use the washroom.
Terrific.
Eating before everyone else again?
This is good, mom.
Try some.
- Smart boy.
You know how to pick them.
- What?
She's such a wonderful girl.
You must have taken after your father.
Mom was just talking about you.
Mom, this is Judy.
Auntie.
Who is she?
My girlfriend.
Then, who's the one in the kitchen?
What kitchen?
Wai Hung...
Who's this woman?
There's something wrong with her mentally.
She's crazy.
I really don't know who she is.
She's nuts.
How can I be called Wai Hung?
Who is really my daughter-in-law-to-be?
Of course it's this one, mom.
Her?
Are you sure?
What are you doing?
She's not be the real thing, is she?
What real thing?
How you wish?
You're kept this woman here...
- behind my back?
- Who says?
Mrs. Ho, you do know how to bring up your son.
Teaching him to be a two-timer.
Watch it.
You might spoil him to death.
What's wrong with that?
- His father was a clock repairman.
- Right.
- He could time 10 clocks at a time.
- Right.
You can't take it?
There's other fish in the sea.
Mom, don't say that.
I'm talking to your son, you shut up.
Ask me to shut up?
I'm telling you to ship out.
Mom, Judy, I can explain.
I don't know her, she's crazy.
Wai Hung, Mrs., how's life?
You spoil everything.
What have you got to say now, Wai Hung?
I don't ever want to see you again.
Get out!
Stand still.
I've never interfered with your life before.
But choosing a wife is a big thing.
One must choose carefully.
If it's like that Judy, I won't have it.
Kwong Sun, Don't be frightened.
As long as I'm here, he can't bully you.
Come on in.
Mom.
Granny, when cousin Wai Hung and I left for H.K.
I thought our future was so bright and hopeful.
I'd never thought it would turn out like this.
Auntie Wan doesn't want me to stay with her.
But I've met this friend.
Both his mom and he treated me really well.
- Wai Hung.
- l'm not Wai Hung. I'm a trouble seeker.
I hate to bump into you.
Can't you leave me alone?
If that's too much to ask, leave my mom alone.
Let me warn you, don't get too friendly with her.
I'm sorry.
I was just talking nonsense just now.
Can't leave you alone for a minute.
All is well, get some sleep.
Let's have breakfast tomorrow before I leave.
How's the girl back home?
No thanks to you.
If she can't regain her memories ever.
You'll have to mind her the rest of her life.
Yes. I've got it all figured out for you.
It'll cost around $3,000 per month.
That much?
Around that I'll ask you for it on pay day.
You're kidding?
Who's kidding?
Look what's happening over there?
Make way.
We're the police.
What's going on?
Sir, one of our customers passed out suddenly.
Can you come and check on him?
- Calm down, let me take a look.
- Thanks.
Please co-operate and move out of the way.
Fine now, go back to work.
Sir, will that do?
Of course.
I've learnt this from St. John's.
Can't you people hear me?
I said out.
It's not working.
Sir.
His breathing is getting weak.
Will mouth to mouth resuscitation work?
- l'll give it a try.
- Thanks.
Bad breath.
It really stinks.
I can't stand it.
Get up.
What are you doing?
Stop kicking him.
He's not well.
Get up...
What are you trying to do?
Kill him?
What are you doing?
Get up.
Damn it...
You sure know how to put one on.
Let me go for old times' sake, please.
Must you do your act in such lavishing style?
I don't own all the restaurants here you know.
There's no informers' fees coming.
- And I'm broke.
- Get out of my sight.
Go...
Jerk.
Sir, how can you let him go without paying?
How much did he owe you?
I'll pay for him.
That's more like it.
Just take this money.
Still stinks?
This is useless.
I must get some insecticide.
That guy's mouth is worse than a sewer.
Really, you should have told me he's pretending.
Don't want to spoil your enthusiasm.
That bum sure is a good actor.
He could have me fooled if it's not for you.
Honey.
Can't you remember what today is?
What?
Your Birthday?
More important than my birthdays.
It's our wedding anniversary.
- For you.
- Thank you.
More coming.
Thank you...
You're welcome.
There's more...
What's this?
Open it.
is this a net?
- Negligee.
- Negligee?
For you?
- No, for you.
- l'm not wearing it.
You prefer being nude?
Fine with me.
What are you doing?
Something that'll have a result in 10 months.
I can't.
- You can't?
But I can.
Come, my darling.
- No...
My mom's not here.
We're married.
What are you afraid of?
Don't be shy.
We're husband and wife.
Come on, darling.
You don't like it here?
We'll go in the bedroom.
Let go of me...
Here I come.
Please don't. I'm not your wife.
Don't treat me as your loving husband.
Treat me as an animal.
Stop it. I'm really not your wife.
Then why do you keep saying you are before?
But I'm really not your wife. I'm not.
That I know from the start.
Who are you really?
I am sorry.
I don't want your apologies.
Who are you?
Actually, I'm a stowaway.
It's by chance that I bumped into you.
I didn't mean to deceive you.
You didn't mean to deceive me?
Calling Bon, wanted at headquarter.
Urgent.
Be there right away.
Bon, please don't arrest me.
I'll leave.
As a cop, I should have arrested you long ago.
But it's our fault that you got injured first.
I'll let you off the hook this time.
I want you gone before I come home.
Addict Hung is upstairs having treatment.
- Not putting me on again?
- No.
Go.
Both front and back doors are guarded.
But we don't know what's happening upstairs.
Send one of our men to go in as a patient.
But Hung will recognise all of us.
Yes.
He has seen me before.
Does Hung have 2 big pimples on his nose?
I can't remember.
See?
Since you can't remember how he looks like, he won't remember you neither.
We'll give you a brand new image.
Let's go.
Can I help you?
I've twisted my spinal cord, I think.
- Come in and have a seat.
- Thank you.
How did you get this?
Thanks to this book.
Those positions can really get you.
I think I've hurt my back real bad.
- Just fill out this registration form.
- Thanks.
Calling station.
Only suspect and one woman here.
Get our men ready and stand by at the front.
Are you the one twisted the spinal cord?
Yes... lt's your turn.
So soon. lsn't he first?
He's just waiting for someone.
Come in.
Crazy.
Doctor, I just...
What now?
There may be a lump in my underarms.
No problem. I'll just change needles.
- Doctor...
- Yes?
- Actually, I'm...
- What is it now?
Not only is there a lump in my underarms.
I think I have breast cancer.
Well then, we'll need a bigger needle.
No...
Help...
Ouch.
The pain.
Freeze.
Police.
Bad.
You've been out cold for the past 24 hours.
How did you get here?
Your mom just went home to rest this morning.
She'll come and see you again later on.
Thanks for talking care of me.
I won't bother you anymore.
Where are you going?
Mom, he's better now.
You must be tired staying up all night.
Go home and get some rest.
- Bon.
- Mom.
Mom, I must leave H.K. for a few days.
I won't have time to come over.
Take care of yourself.
Kwong Sun...
Don't say anything. I know what happened.
No matter where you are from.
I'll always consider you as my daughter-in-law.
Stay with me.
Don't cry, my child.
Bon is a good son, Let me talk to him.
What is it now, mom?
A woman knows how a woman feel.
That poor girl.
A young girl in a strange place all by herself.
She told you?
She didn't tell me anything.
I saw her letter.
She was born here you know.
All she needs is to find proofs.
Mom, I'm a policeman.
How can I keep a stowaway in my house?
Nobody will know if she doesn't go out.
Of course I can't decide.
Or else she can stay.
It all depends on you.
You do what you want.
is that a yes or a no?
What do you think?
Whatever you say mom.
Happy now?
I'm just trying to help a poor girl.
Kwong Sun... ls the person in charge here?
Anything important?
I want to have my birth certificate searched.
The owner went to Macau.
Come back next week.
Dim sum.
Tasty dim sum.
Want something, miss?
How about these?
They're fresh.
- Pay time...
- l can get paid.
- How many days have you worked?
- Seven.
That's $280.
With tips, that's...
The immigration people are here to spot check.
What should I do?
Go.
Hurry up.
What about my pay?
What?
Worry about it later.
- But my pay.
- You'll be in a mess if they caught you.
You'll get deported.
You'll get us all in trouble too.
Go...
What are you doing coming back here?
Hurry up, go.
Nice.
We have more money to spend this month.
Right on.
Want to make more money?
Hire stowaway workers.
Shut up and hand me my share.
- Mahjong?
- l'm not playing.
What do you mean?
We've said earlier that we're celebration Bon's recovery with a game.
I won't win.
You always cheat.
What?
Me cheat?
Yes.
You never wear your underwear when you play.
It's a real curse.
I know I can't.
What's the big deal?
You four go ahead.
Don't count me in.
Forget it.
Let's go.
Bye...
- Want to go see a movie?
- Fine.
- What now?
- Your wife.
- What?
- Let's see what's going on first.
We've just got rid of her.
Don't bother with her.
It might get sticky.
If she can't heck it, she'll come back.
Let's go.
I hate to be on duty when it rains.
We are soaked.
All over my pants.
Damn. I'll get you next time.
Let's find somewhere to dry off.
How about over there?
is there something I can do for you?
She's my sister.
She has moved to Canada.
I'm not sure if there are any references left.
There're appliances and files to be packaged.
They are not shipped out yet.
Do you think you can help me out?
No problem.
Why don't you write to her.
And tell her your situation?
Can you give me her address?
Of course.
Let me get it for you.
Here it is.
Thanks a lot... lt's nothing.
Write to her soon.
- l will.
Goodbye.
- Bye.
You two wait here.
I need to get some money.
Wait here for him.
I'll bring the car over.
Told you not to lay them out so far.
Sorry sir. I'll fix it right away.
I've told you many times.
Want to get arrested?
Sorry...
Miss.
What are you doing here?
I'm just waiting for some friends.
Can I see your l.D.?
Let's see some identification.
Partner, what is it?
is she your friend?
Yes.
Sorry, we're running out of time.
Stay right here.
Duty is duty.
Sorry to trouble you. l.D. please.
I told you we're in a hurry.
Excuse me. l.D. please.
Can't you just spare me the trouble?
Sorry no.
Please show your l.D.
- Haven't got it?
- What is it?
Who's bugging you?
Say what?
I suspect she doesn't have any l.D.
Sorry, l.D. please.
Come over here, partner.
I'm from Kowloon Headquarter, Triad Dept.
Listen!
No matter what you see, don't be nervous.
Stay calm.
We have received information.
There'll be 8 armed men coming to rob this bank.
Don't get nervous...
Our men are dispersed all over this area.
including those two at the back.
They can't identify themselves on the street.
How many robbers will there be, you know?
Around 8 Armed with 2 handguns and 4 rifles.
There may be hand grenades and machine guns too.
- Don't let this information out.
- l know.
Can I help you?
What can you help me?
I wanted to.
But since cadet school, I've only open fired twice.
And both times, I missed and hit on-lookers.
There's no need then.
This is a dangerous case.
Can't make any unnecessary sacrifice, right?
- Right.
- l'll leave.
Don't look around.
Stay cool.
Don't frown.
Try to whistle.
Whistling may help relax you.
Strange?
How come everyone seems to know I have no l.D.?
Of course.
Look at you.
Sure look conspicuous.
I'll take you to get some decent clothes.
Go try it on.
How do you know this place?
Judy took me here.
Watch it.
You might bump into her.
Don't be silly. lt's office hours.
How come she's here?
- Miss, Please wrap this up for me.
- Yes?
Yes.
See anything you like?
No.
Nothing fits me.
- lt's not good.
- Shut up.
I want to look at some sunglasses.
- Girls, take your time.
- Yes.
Bon, what are you doing here?
What a coincidence.
Long Man and I are looking for toilets.
- We have to go desperately.
- Yes.
is this a toilet?
So, is you.
Don't you lose your cool.
Let me explain.
I won't but I don't want your explanation. I'm leaving.
Miss Judy, please let me explain.
Slut.
- Why do you hit her?
- So what?
What do you want?
Please, stop it.
Get your hands off me or I'll yell rape.
Enough.
Look at you.
You're acting like a maniac.
Yes, I'm a maniac.
At least I'm not like her a cheap whore.
Who do you think you are?
You're just a cop.
I'm raising your standard by being seen with you.
Men like you are a dime a dozen.
But if you want to find another girlfriend like me.
Do more good deeds.
Maybe in your next life.
Find a wealthy father.
Then, you may have some hope yet.
Only men like you are worthy of women like her.
Have you said enough?
Sure.
I've hit her enough and yelled enough.
What can you do about it?
Arrest me?
I'll arrest you.
As a member of the Royal H.K. Police Force.
I am charging you for assault.
She is the victim.
I'm the eye-witness.
Don't be scared.
What's so big deal about cops?
Right.
Take them to court.
You two know this woman?
What if we do?
Then, you two are in this together?
You two may now also be charged as accomplices.
Show your l.D.
Partner, I think we need to call a big van.
Make the call now.
I don't know her well.
We'll just acquaintances.
I'm just doing my job.
Get your l.D. out.
l.D.
Forget it.
You're lucky the victim isn't pressing charges.
Can I go now?
Wait.
Legally, you can go.
But personally, I think you owe her an apology.
Me, apologising to her?
Say it.
Sorry.
Can you people hear her?
No...
Well, they can't hear you.
Sorry.
Let her go.
Why don't you answer the phone?
My ears need a rest.
Let me explain to her.
Just wait till she cools off first.
No explaining now.
She thinks we're together.
Let me shower first and we'll go eat something.
Bon, listen good. I've turned the gas on.
You better come here in 10 minutes and apologise.
Or I'll kill myself.
Please calm down, Miss Judy.
Let me tell you the whole story.
He's just being kind to take me in.
Who are you talking to?
It's Miss Judy.
Come talk to her.
She wants to kill herself.
Don't over react.
I won't.
At least my place isn't a refugee hut.
What do you mean?
That dummy told me everything.
Normally, I should feel proud.
To have such a boyfriend as kind as you.
But you really overdid it this time.
Now is my chance to make you pay.
I'm giving you ten minutes to get your ass over here.
Or I'll call the police on you.
Judy.
What did she say?
Stupid.
Why did you tell her everything?
We're in deep trouble.
What do you want?
What do I want?
Don't think I'm blackmailing you to get you back.
I won't.
I go out with you because you're not bad looking.
At least, you won't degrade me.
Thank you.
I know I'm too good and refined for you.
But still, I gave you the chance.
So that you'll feel grateful towards me.
And will obey my every command.
But you not only do you disobey me.
You even step on me.
So, I'm not giving you another chance.
It's finished between us.
Are you finished?
Stop. lf you go, I'll call the police.
I'll tell them you hid a stowaway at your place.
If you're not a woman, what you've just said... will entitle you to a good beating.
If you aqueal on me, I won't keep your secret.
I'll tell the world.
Your breasts are injected.
Jackass.
Where are you going?
Sorry to have trouble you.
I'm really grateful.
I don't want to bother you anymore.
Goodbye.
It's true you're given me a handful.
But I've given you a lot of troubles too.
I'll feel like a jerk if you go now.
Well, I've always been a jerk.
But ever since you came, I find being a jerk with you is better than being a jerk alone.
What do you say?
I am very democratic.
It's good if you stay.
If not, it's fine with me.
I've made up my mind.
I should really go.
Goodbye.
I'm not democratic at all.
I won't let you go even if you want to.
I'm serious.
You've gone through so much to get here.
All you need now is just one letter.
What if you get caught by the police?
All your efforts will be in vain.
Don't worry.
I'll take good care of myself.
Of course you know how to take care of yourself.
If both of us can take care of ourselves.
Then let us take care of ourselves together. lf...
What am I saying?
Will you stay?
Want to go for some fresh air?
- Where?
- Come.
I'm going to work now.
Don't leave the house.
Bye.
Wait.
Where do you think you're doing?
Let go of me...
Let you go?
I tried so hard to get you out here.
What have I got in return?
Look at my face.
Come out, you bitch.
What's going on?
Shut up.
Stand aside.
One word out of you and I'll kill you.
Move...
Sir, it's me.
What do you want?
Don't be uptight.
Money is all I want.
For only $30,000.
All will be well.
Where do you want to collect the money?
That was a fast decision.
Today, 3 pm.
At Kowloon Tong Rail Station.
Sir.
Where's my friend?
Don't think I'm dumb enough to bring her along.
As long as you pay me.
And I can leave in one piece.
You'll have your girl back in no time.
I'm not looking for trouble.
- Count it.
- There's no need for that.
Thank you.
One more small request.
I wonder if you'll oblige?
What?
I want to treat you to a train ride.
Fine.
- l'll see that you get aboard.
Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
Bon voyage.
Hello, Wei.
- Mister.
- Yes?
- Which floor does that man live on?
- Second floor.
I'll wait for you at the front.
No one's home.
I saw him come in awhile ago.
I'll go up and check.
Mr. Ho.
There's a registered letter for you.
Are you the Mr. Ho on 1st floor, block A?
Yes.
Please sign here for your letter.
Thank you.
Thanks...
People like us do keep our word.
Since I've been paid, of course I'll let you go.
However, I can't let you have it so easy.
I'm not born gorgeous looking.
Thanks to you for this scar.
I don't think there's much hope for me left.
You've given me such an unforgettable present.
I must return the favor before letting you go.
Not so easy.
Bitch.
Go to hell.
You can't leave so easily.
Get up.
Help...
No, please...
Help me...
How pretty.
This is just the beginning.
No...
What took you?
- How are things?
- They're upstairs.
Everything is all right now.
What are you doing?
Give me back my gun...
Don't come near me.
This is no joke. lt's dangerous.
If you come near me, I'll shoot.
Don't fool around, it's dangerous.
Give me back my gun.
I'll shoot.
Taxi.
Don't move.
Are you crazy?
Sir, help me... 34587 calling station.
Don't move.
Bon.
Call an ambulance.
Bon, how are you feeling?
I am fine.
Mom took me to a fortune teller once.
He said I will live till I'm 80.
That's why I was fine from the fall last time.
I'll make it this time as well.
But if I don't pull through.
You must take care of mom and Kwong Sun for me.
I will.
Pal, don't ruin it.
Don't let me see you cry.
I won't cry.
I'll go check on the ambulance.
What are you doing?
You are a policeman.
Crying in public.
What a disgrace!
I quit.
Can I cry now?
Sir, it's a real mess down there.
I think you can get your l.D. soon.
But I don't know if I'll live to see it.
I may not make it.
No.
You will be alright.
I'm not sure if he'll be all right.
But as for you, I'm sure you won't be.
Yes.
- No...
- Check to see if the ambulance is here.
- Don't...
- Go.
Don't tear us apart, no...
Bon...
Just rest.
Get her into the car.
- Let me.
- Go down and check.
Don't worry.
Nothing will happen to Bon.
Get in the car first.
No need for the ambulance.
Call the undertaker.
What?
Undertaker?
Bon.
Get a hold of her...
What's going on?
...
Let go of me...
Stop it.
Bon...
Miss, why are you crying again?
Careful.
He's one of our men.
If it's not for that pager in your pocket, your injuries may be fatal.
It's still working.
Bon, how do you feel?
The fortune teller may be right.
It might not be time for me to go yet.
There's something I want to ask you long ago?
Do you really have a husband named Wai Hung?
He's my cousin back home.
Tell mom to bring my birth certificate along... when she comes to see me.
Why?
I'm going to change my name to Wai Hung legally.
Since both you and mom keep calling me that.
Might as well let it be.
If you wish I don't mind what name you call me.
Bon, I'm not worth your while.
What can I say to make you understand?
I am not a perfect person.
And I've never asked for perfect things.
What happened today may have marked you for life.
But, let me tell you.
In my heart you will always be the best.
Don't go...
Stop fighting.
Damn shorty, how dare you hit your superior?
You won't even let me see him for the last time.
Bon, you didn't die?
He didn't but you will.
Who are you talking to me as?
Using pressure on me as a superior again?
We'll do it man to man.
Even if you tell mom, I'll still get you.
You damn shorty...
Don't you guys help out.
I've been wanting to fix you for a long time.
Then, as your Uncle, have a slap on me.
Go tell your mommy now.
Stop the car...

You looking for something?
Get back to your workstation.
It's not there.
He switched the numbers.
He switched the numbers.
- Morning, Ms. DiPesto.
- Morning, Ms. Hayes.
Ms. DiPesto, is everything all right?
All right?
Well, you seem a little, I don't know, down.
Down?
Me?
No, I'm not down.
All right.
Blue Moon Detective Agency.
If you're in trouble, if you're in a jam, don't tell me, I don't give a damn.
Ms. DiPesto, would you step into my office.
What for?
Right away, Ms. Hayes.
- You wanna tell me about it?
- No.
- Nothing to tell.
- Ms. DiPesto, I saw you out there.
Ms. Hayes, it's not something you'd understand.
It's just something I do.
Something I go through.
Did something happen?
It's a new year, that's all.
A new year.
At the beginning of every new year, I sit down and review my life.
- Well, that's a good thing to do.
- It takes about a minute.
I do the same thing each day, Ms. Hayes.
- Excuse me?
- My life it's nothing but the same thing, day after day.
I get up at the same time, 6:30.
I take the same bus, the number five.
I order the same doughnut when I get to work, jelly.
I answer the same phone, yours.
It's not a terrible life but it's not a soon-to-be major motion picture either.
What about after work?
After work?
After work, there's me Pat Sajak, Vanna White and the Wheel of Fortune.
- I hate my name.
- DiPesto?
No, Agnes.
- You don't like DiPesto?
- Me?
No, I love DiPesto.
- I love Agnes.
- Well, I hate it.
I've always wanted to be a Barbara or an Elaine.
- I once knew a Barbara.
She wasn't-
- I hate having black hair.
- I didn't mean to depress you.
- You didn't.
Yes, I did.
I better get back to my rut.
- Picked up the suit-
- Wouldn't it be awful to wake up every morning and know that every day was gonna be the same as the day before?
The polka shoes too, but I ain't doing no bunny hop.
To know every week is gonna be the same as every other week.
A band whose idea of hot is playing "Born in the U.S.A." on the accordion.
- Answering the same phone.
- I have a confession.
- I don't wanna go.
- Where?
Were you talking to me?
What are you saying?
You first.
What were you talking about?
The California Investigators Association annual banquet.
You?
Ms. DiPesto.
She's been acting very strangely.
- How can you tell?
- She's depressed, sick of life.
- I'm worried.
- Don't worry.
She's just having an attack of UMS.
- UMS?
- Ugly mood swing.
A peculiarly feminine disease.
- About this banquet-
- Exactly, I don't wanna go.
- We're going, it's important.
- For what?
It's a chance to fight in public, but what else?
- Business.
- Business?
Business what?
Now, the Annual Convention of Wife Cheaters would be good for business.
- It'll be interesting.
- It'll be boring.
The only thing that could liven it up is a strip-search demonstration with you.
Addison thank you.
I think.
- We're going.
- Oh, come on, Maddie.
Being detectives is what we do all day, every day.
I don't wanna-
- Say that again.
- "That."
David, you've just given me a wonderful idea.
That strip-search thing?
How do you feel about barnyard animals?
Being detectives is what we do all day, but it's not what Ms. DiPesto does.
- Not what Ms. DiPesto does at all.
- Thank the Lord for small favors.
This could be exactly what she needs.
Are you suggesting sending DiPesto to this banquet?
There will be other banquets for us, but Agnes how many banquets are in her future?
- All right, you convinced me.
- I'll give DiPesto my ticket and you can be her escort.
Wait a second!
Maddie, we can't do that to Agnes.
- We can't?
- She shows up with me...
- ...she won't meet other men.
- Think so?
Yes, I know so.
Guys don't hit on other men's women.
It's like the rule, a code, like-
- Honor among thieves?
- Exactly like that.
Maddie, Agnes has gotta be free to network chitchat, knickknack, paddywack, give a dog a bone if she wants a guy to roll her home.
- You might be right.
- Might be?
Am be.
Definitely am be.
Maddie, it's time to let our little girl grow up.
So I vote no to the chaperone at the dance.
Give her the keys to the car and hey, let's forego the curfew, huh?
- You think so?
- Maddie I know this is very hard for you but there comes a time when you just have to let go.
David, let go.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you...
Ms. DiPesto, I just had an idea.
You ought to get somebody look at that.
Would you like to go to a soiree with a bunch of private dicks?
- Excuse me?
- What Mr. Addison is trying to say is I had an idea.
- You doing anything tonight?
- She is going to the California Investigators Association annual banquet.
- I am?
- You am.
- But I don't have a date.
- You don't need a date.
All you need's a ticket and something to wear.
- Don't have that either.
- But you will.
- I will?
- You will.
Remember, no plunging necklines or patent-leather shoes.
Go!
Oh, Ms. DiPesto.
Some kind of jam-up up ahead.
You mind if I let you out up here?
CALIFORNIA INVESTIGATORS ASSOC.
- Oh, my.
- Dance with me.
Excuse me?
Dance with me.
You have a name?
Yes.
What is it?
It's Elaine.
Well, Elaine, I really appreciate this.
Do you work in town?
The Blue Moon Detective Agency.
Why?
I wanna give you something.
Hold on to this number.
Elaine, how long can you hold your breath?
You mean, like in scuba?
Elaine, thanks a lot.
Don't mention it.
So...
- ...how'd it go?
- Oh, Ms. Hayes, it was nice.
Only nice, huh?
You meet somebody?
Oh, boy, what a body.
- Was he nice?
- Nicer than nice.
At first I thought he'd made a mistake and he meant to come up to somebody else-
Morning, children, what's the poop on the prom?
Ms. DiPesto met a man at the banquet.
No kidding, facial hair and everything?
That explains the smile.
- The smile?
- You should try it sometime.
- Perfect cure for UMS.
- UMS?
Urgently missing sex.
Excuse me, Ms. Hayes.
We'll talk at lunch?
I promise.
Blue Moon Detective Agency.
Say your pooch hasn't yet come home.
Called his name, bought him a new bone.
Give us a shot.
Mad and Dave will find Spot-
Elaine.
- How you doing, Elaine?
- Could you call back?
- I need to talk to you.
- You do?
You wanna go get something to eat?
- He's here.
- Who's here?
- He's here.
- He's here?
Him?
- He wants to take me to lunch.
- At a quarter after 9?
- Would it be okay?
- Sure it'd be okay.
Can I meet him?
Sure you can meet him.
Do me a favor, call me Elaine.
I'd like you to meet my employer.
- Madelyn Hayes.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- We've really gotta go.
- Well, it was nice meeting you, Mr...?
- Likewise.
Ms. DiPesto, have you seen my-?
- Where is she going?
- Lunch.
That the guy from last night?
- Big appetite.
- What is that supposed to mean?
Come on, Maddie.
A man, a woman.
- A nooner.
- A what?
Or in this case, a niner.
This is nice.
This is different.
I never knew this was here.
They serve good food here?
- Listen, about last night...
- That was something, huh?
I mean, I don't know what a guy like you was doing...
- ... dancing with a girl like me, but-
- Look, I appreciate what you did.
If you hadn't been so pleasant about everything...
I love to dance.
Only wish you hadn't disappeared so fast, though.
If you hadn't given me your number I was afraid I'd never see you again.
- I don't even know your name.
- It's Kyle.
About that piece of paper.
The one with all the numbers on it.
I must have called it about 600 times.
I need it back.
The piece of paper, I need it back.
Telephone call for Agnes DiPesto at the front desk.
- Telephone for Agnes DiPesto.
- How about that.
Somebody's paging my sister.
I'll be right back.
Yeah.
Hello?
Hello?
Excuse me, sir, are you sure somebody called me?
- There's nobody here.
- Maybe they hung up.
Then why did they call me?
Maybe they're from that show, In Search of...
Between the time they called and you picked up they found what they were looking for.
- Excuse me.
- That's okay.
I liked it.
- Don't scream.
- Don't scream?
Mister?
Please, come quickly, hurry.
- What's the trouble?
- Please!
There's something wrong with my date.
Not much I can do about that.
No, you don't understand.
It's like he's dead, lifeless.
Some guys, average bowlers, you buy them a ball...
No, I mean he's really dead.
And I came back from the phone and-
Oh, my goodness.
He was right there.
He had his head down on the table and he had a knife in his chest.
- Maybe he wandered off.
- With a knife in his chest?
Oh, I don't think it was one of your knives.
- Out of my alley.
- Why?
I don't want you here.
Out of my alley.
Get out of here!
My alley, get out!
- But there was a man murdered here.
- Get out.
- Out.
- There really was.
I'm telling you for the last time, get out of here.
You hear me?
Get out!
- So how'd you do?
- Excuse me?
How'd you do, bowling?
Not many people bowling at 9:45 in the morning.
Me?
I bowled 188 which is a significant improvement over my afternoon performance.
A theory I have about morning versus afternoon versus evening physical performance in humans.
I've found mornings, across the board yield better results in overall physical activity.
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Maybe our professional sporting teams should play each other in the morning.
Maybe the team that comes from the latest time zone has an unfair advantage.
And I'm not just talking about sports, I'm talking about any activity that requires physical exertion for a protracted period of time.
- You live around here?
- Excuse me?
- Wanna go to your place?
- What I just told you, it's only a theory.
- Now.
- I'll get my rosin bag.
- This seems like a very nice place.
- Thank you, I like it.
Direct-dial phone, in-room TV, queen-sized bed.
Direct-dial phone, huh?
Could you draw the drapes, please?
- Thank you.
- Wanna watch some in-room TV?
Would you give me a hand with this thing?
A hand?
What is it exactly you wanna do with this?
Put it in front of the door.
It's gonna make it kind of tough to get the paper in the morning.
Listen, I realize we hardly know each other but I was just
- I mean, we are in my hotel room moving furniture and all.
I was just kind of wondering, what's your name?
- Agnes.
- Douglas.
We're both S's.
Is someone chasing you?
Your husband?
I'm not married.
- Boyfriend?
- I don't have a boyfriend.
Not that I know of anyway.
Does this perhaps have something to do with your profession?
- What is it you do, Agnes?
- I work for a detective agency.
- No kidding.
- No kidding.
I answer the phones.
Which is how I got into this in the first place.
Because I wasn't happy just answering the phones.
So my boss, Maddie Hayes gave me these tickets to go to this dance, and I met this guy.
Guy?
Don't worry.
For one thing, I don't think I'm his type and for another, he's dead.
- Dead?
- Dead.
If you're a woman, death after the first date does not do a lot for your self-confidence.
What are you doing hanging around with people who die?
If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not talk about all that right now.
I'd really like to talk about something else.
So, what do you do?
Me?
I'm involved in the personal-services industry.
- I sell shoes.
- Shoes?
Shoes.
Everybody needs them.
Everybody uses them.
Everybody needs to replace them.
Shoes.
Yep.
I help keep America on its feet.
That's on a poster where I work.
- Do you like it?
- Shoes?
You may not have noticed, but I'm kind of short.
Low to the ground.
But for a shoe salesman, this is a big plus.
You're much closer to your product and where your product's gonna be used.
It's sort of my destiny.
You know, this isn't how I thought it was gonna be at all.
When I told Ms. Hayes that I wanted to do something exciting I thought it would all be less dangerous and more fun.
Why don't I give you something to drink.
Something to drink maybe.
You know what I should do?
I should try calling them.
I'll just tell them I'm here with you and-
Sorry, Agnes.
Hello?
What happened?
Did something happen?
Whatever it was, I didn't sleep through it, did I?
Nothing's happened.
I've just given you a shot of sodium pentathol.
Truth serum.
Truth serum?
To relax you help you lose your inhibitions, help you clear your mind, that's all.
Just listen to me, just think about what I'm asking you.
Douglas, I don't like this.
Here's the first question.
- Who do you work for?
- Well, David Addison hired me but I really work for Maddie Hayes.
We all work for Maddie Hayes.
And who's Maddie Hayes?
Has anyone ever told you that you have beautiful eyes?
It's important that you let me ask the questions, Agnes.
- You have a great mouth too.
- Thank you.
To the best of your knowledge, are either of them involved in espionage?
I just had a thought.
I bet you don't sell shoes for a living.
- Answer the question, Agnes.
- No.
I mean, "No, to the best of my knowledge neither of them are involved in espionage."
Not, "No, I won't answer the question."
Now you say something nice about me.
- Excuse me?
- It's your turn...
- ...to say something nice about me.
- It is?
I like what you're doing with your hair there.
It's very different, very nice.
But I don't do anything with my hair.
So you'd never met Kyle till he asked you to dance?
Kyle.
- What a gorgeous man.
- Answer the question.
You sound angry.
There's no reason to be angry.
I never met Kyle until he asked me to dance.
- Kyle danced great.
- I know.
- I saw you.
- You saw us?
- How could you have seen us?
- I was there.
Kyle and I worked together.
I was sort of his boss.
Wait a second.
So when you bumped into me at the bowling alley-
I knew somebody was after him.
I had to find out if it was you.
Are you guys spies?
Better get your coat.
GAYLORD APARTMENTS
- Where you wanna go?
- Straight to the top.
President of Blue Moon Detective Agencies.
No, I mean now.
Here in this cab.
Do I have to go somewhere?
There are things I have to do.
Work I have to attend to.
Don't worry, I'll see you again.
- You promise?
- Absolutely.
Well...
Will one of you tell me if this is gonna go on?
I'll start the meter.
- Why did you do that?
- I couldn't help myself.
I understand that.
Now, where do you live?
This thing between us is really zipping along, isn't it?
No.
I mean, so this man can drive you home.
- What's your address?
- Oh, 6338 Hope Street.
Isn't that a wonderful name for a street?
Hope Street.
That's why I moved there, because of the name.
Other than that, it isn't much of a place to live.
You're a very special woman, Agnes.
- Why have we stopped?
- Red light.
- 2151 Sherwood Way.
- Sorry, pal, I already have a fare.
That's okay, I don't mind sharing.
- Please.
- Thank you.
Although I still think it was rude of you, after I let you share my cab not to let me go where I wanted to go.
Stop that.
- Stop what?
- That!
That gibberish talk.
I don't believe it, and I don't believe you.
I know who you are.
You're Kyle's girl.
Or you were.
And now you're Doug's.
Doug's girl, Doug's contact.
- So give us the number.
- What number?
The bundle number.
The number of the bundle that contains the plans.
I'm sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about.
You know exactly what I'm talking about.
We've been smuggling plans out of High Castle Defense in laundry bundles.
Your people figured out what we were doing and planted a man here in the middle of the laundry.
- We did?
- We found out and killed your man but not before he was able to switch the bundle numbers on some very important plans.
What makes you think I have this number?
The man who infiltrated us was Kyle.
And we know that Kyle passed the number on to you.
- He did?
- At the dance.
Just like he was supposed to, just as you had planned it.
So, what is it?
I don't know.
- I don't know.
- The number!
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.
Last night I went to this reception, a man asked me to dance.
This morning he took me to coffee and got killed.
This other man shot me with truth serum.
The two of you hijacked my cab.
I don't know what's going on.
I don't know anything.
I'm nobody's contact.
Nobody's girl.
I answer phones.
I'm a lady who answers phones.
Do you think I could use the facilities?
Let's not make a career of it.
How we doing in there?
Did you fall in?
Get back here, you!
Hey, you!
COLD WATER RINSE

What good's a romantic hero if he's not there when you need him?

- Everything's gonna be fine.
Agnes, just stay calm.
You're perfectly safe up there.

Doug!
- Thanks!
- Don't mention it.
Agnes!
Are you okay?
Here we go again.
Thanks, Lou.
- You know him?
- Yeah, he works for me too.
Agnes, what's that?
Doug, don't get upset.
This is Kyle's phone number.
- He gave it to me last night.
- Kyle's number?
And this laundry bundle was filled with plans?
Honest Injun.
Agnes, you understand, you won't be able to tell anyone about what went on today.
National security.
Yeah, no.
National security.
I'm sorry you had to get involved.
You are?
Well...
Well?
Well...
You got any more of that truth stuff with you?
No.
Guess we'll have to do without.
Here she comes.
I gotta be honest, I never thought she had it in her.
- David, we don't know what happened.
- Come on, she left 24 hours ago.
- She had more than a tuna sandwich.
- Will you stop?
Face it.
Her nooner became an afternooner, which became a nighter which probably became an overnighter.
Morning, Ms. Hayes.
Morning, Mr. Addison.
- Morning, Ms. DiPesto.
- Morning, Ms. DiPesto.
Sorry I'm a little late.
Actually, I'm a lot late.
Kind of missed yesterday, didn't I?
I stopped over at the cleaner's.
You didn't have to do that.
- So?
- So?
So?
Did you at least get a nice dinner out of it?
David.
I'll tell you something.
I missed you guys.
I missed this place, I missed that phone.
Life is pretty good.
Yeah life is pretty good.
So she's not gonna share the intimate details?
- We better get back to work.
- We don't have any work.
We have to tell the writers to write bigger parts...
- ...for next week's episode.
- I'll buy that.
- Special delivery for an Agnes DiPesto.
- I'm Agnes DiPesto.
Sign here.
Thank you.
Dear Agnes:
Unfortunately, I had to leave Los Angeles this morning.
Of course, I can't tell you where I'm going and I can't tell you when I'll be back.
The truth is I can't tell you much of anything except how terrific I think you are.
Thinking of you, Doug.

You looking for something?
Get back to your workstation.
It's not there.
He switched the numbers.
He switched the numbers.
- Morning, Ms. DiPesto.
- Morning, Ms. Hayes.
Ms. DiPesto, is everything all right?
All right?
Well, you seem a little, I don't know, down.
Down?
Me?
No, I'm not down.
All right.
Blue Moon Detective Agency.
If you're in trouble, if you're in a jam, don't tell me, I don't give a damn.
Ms. DiPesto, would you step into my office.
What for?
Right away, Ms. Hayes.
- You wanna tell me about it?
- No.
- Nothing to tell.
- Ms. DiPesto, I saw you out there.
Ms. Hayes, it's not something you'd understand.
It's just something I do.
Something I go through.
Did something happen?
It's a new year, that's all.
A new year.
At the beginning of every new year, I sit down and review my life.
- Well, that's a good thing to do.
- It takes about a minute.
I do the same thing each day, Ms. Hayes.
- Excuse me?
- My life it's nothing but the same thing, day after day.
I get up at the same time, 6:30.
I take the same bus, the number five.
I order the same doughnut when I get to work, jelly.
I answer the same phone, yours.
It's not a terrible life but it's not a soon-to-be major motion picture either.
What about after work?
After work?
After work, there's me Pat Sajak, Vanna White and the Wheel of Fortune.
- I hate my name.
- DiPesto?
No, Agnes.
- You don't like DiPesto?
- Me?
No, I love DiPesto.
- I love Agnes.
- Well, I hate it.
I've always wanted to be a Barbara or an Elaine.
- I once knew a Barbara.
She wasn't-
- I hate having black hair.
- I didn't mean to depress you.
- You didn't.
Yes, I did.
I better get back to my rut.
- Picked up the suit-
- Wouldn't it be awful to wake up every morning and know that every day was gonna be the same as the day before?
The polka shoes too, but I ain't doing no bunny hop.
To know every week is gonna be the same as every other week.
A band whose idea of hot is playing "Born in the U.S.A." on the accordion.
- Answering the same phone.
- I have a confession.
- I don't wanna go.
- Where?
Were you talking to me?
What are you saying?
You first.
What were you talking about?
The California Investigators Association annual banquet.
You?
Ms. DiPesto.
She's been acting very strangely.
- How can you tell?
- She's depressed, sick of life.
- I'm worried.
- Don't worry.
She's just having an attack of UMS.
- UMS?
- Ugly mood swing.
A peculiarly feminine disease.
- About this banquet-
- Exactly, I don't wanna go.
- We're going, it's important.
- For what?
It's a chance to fight in public, but what else?
- Business.
- Business?
Business what?
Now, the Annual Convention of Wife Cheaters would be good for business.
- It'll be interesting.
- It'll be boring.
The only thing that could liven it up is a strip-search demonstration with you.
Addison thank you.
I think.
- We're going.
- Oh, come on, Maddie.
Being detectives is what we do all day, every day.
I don't wanna-
- Say that again.
- "That."
David, you've just given me a wonderful idea.
That strip-search thing?
How do you feel about barnyard animals?
Being detectives is what we do all day, but it's not what Ms. DiPesto does.
- Not what Ms. DiPesto does at all.
- Thank the Lord for small favors.
This could be exactly what she needs.
Are you suggesting sending DiPesto to this banquet?
There will be other banquets for us, but Agnes how many banquets are in her future?
- All right, you convinced me.
- I'll give DiPesto my ticket and you can be her escort.
Wait a second!
Maddie, we can't do that to Agnes.
- We can't?
- She shows up with me...
- ...she won't meet other men.
- Think so?
Yes, I know so.
Guys don't hit on other men's women.
It's like the rule, a code, like-
- Honor among thieves?
- Exactly like that.
Maddie, Agnes has gotta be free to network chitchat, knickknack, paddywack, give a dog a bone if she wants a guy to roll her home.
- You might be right.
- Might be?
Am be.
Definitely am be.
Maddie, it's time to let our little girl grow up.
So I vote no to the chaperone at the dance.
Give her the keys to the car and hey, let's forego the curfew, huh?
- You think so?
- Maddie I know this is very hard for you but there comes a time when you just have to let go.
David, let go.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you...
Ms. DiPesto, I just had an idea.
You ought to get somebody look at that.
Would you like to go to a soiree with a bunch of private dicks?
- Excuse me?
- What Mr. Addison is trying to say is I had an idea.
- You doing anything tonight?
- She is going to the California Investigators Association annual banquet.
- I am?
- You am.
- But I don't have a date.
- You don't need a date.
All you need's a ticket and something to wear.
- Don't have that either.
- But you will.
- I will?
- You will.
Remember, no plunging necklines or patent-leather shoes.
Go!
Oh, Ms. DiPesto.
Some kind of jam-up up ahead.
You mind if I let you out up here?
CALIFORNIA INVESTIGATORS ASSOC.
- Oh, my.
- Dance with me.
Excuse me?
Dance with me.
You have a name?
Yes.
What is it?
It's Elaine.
Well, Elaine, I really appreciate this.
Do you work in town?
The Blue Moon Detective Agency.
Why?
I wanna give you something.
Hold on to this number.
Elaine, how long can you hold your breath?
You mean, like in scuba?
Elaine, thanks a lot.
Don't mention it.
So...
- ...how'd it go?
- Oh, Ms. Hayes, it was nice.
Only nice, huh?
You meet somebody?
Oh, boy, what a body.
- Was he nice?
- Nicer than nice.
At first I thought he'd made a mistake and he meant to come up to somebody else-
Morning, children, what's the poop on the prom?
Ms. DiPesto met a man at the banquet.
No kidding, facial hair and everything?
That explains the smile.
- The smile?
- You should try it sometime.
- Perfect cure for UMS.
- UMS?
Urgently missing sex.
Excuse me, Ms. Hayes.
We'll talk at lunch?
I promise.
Blue Moon Detective Agency.
Say your pooch hasn't yet come home.
Called his name, bought him a new bone.
Give us a shot.
Mad and Dave will find Spot-
Elaine.
- How you doing, Elaine?
- Could you call back?
- I need to talk to you.
- You do?
You wanna go get something to eat?
- He's here.
- Who's here?
- He's here.
- He's here?
Him?
- He wants to take me to lunch.
- At a quarter after 9?
- Would it be okay?
- Sure it'd be okay.
Can I meet him?
Sure you can meet him.
Do me a favor, call me Elaine.
I'd like you to meet my employer.
- Madelyn Hayes.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- We've really gotta go.
- Well, it was nice meeting you, Mr...?
- Likewise.
Ms. DiPesto, have you seen my-?
- Where is she going?
- Lunch.
That the guy from last night?
- Big appetite.
- What is that supposed to mean?
Come on, Maddie.
A man, a woman.
- A nooner.
- A what?
Or in this case, a niner.
This is nice.
This is different.
I never knew this was here.
They serve good food here?
- Listen, about last night...
- That was something, huh?
I mean, I don't know what a guy like you was doing...
- ... dancing with a girl like me, but-
- Look, I appreciate what you did.
If you hadn't been so pleasant about everything...
I love to dance.
Only wish you hadn't disappeared so fast, though.
If you hadn't given me your number I was afraid I'd never see you again.
- I don't even know your name.
- It's Kyle.
About that piece of paper.
The one with all the numbers on it.
I must have called it about 600 times.
I need it back.
The piece of paper, I need it back.
Telephone call for Agnes DiPesto at the front desk.
- Telephone for Agnes DiPesto.
- How about that.
Somebody's paging my sister.
I'll be right back.
Yeah.
Hello?
Hello?
Excuse me, sir, are you sure somebody called me?
- There's nobody here.
- Maybe they hung up.
Then why did they call me?
Maybe they're from that show, In Search of...
Between the time they called and you picked up they found what they were looking for.
- Excuse me.
- That's okay.
I liked it.
- Don't scream.
- Don't scream?
Mister?
Please, come quickly, hurry.
- What's the trouble?
- Please!
There's something wrong with my date.
Not much I can do about that.
No, you don't understand.
It's like he's dead, lifeless.
Some guys, average bowlers, you buy them a ball...
No, I mean he's really dead.
And I came back from the phone and-
Oh, my goodness.
He was right there.
He had his head down on the table and he had a knife in his chest.
- Maybe he wandered off.
- With a knife in his chest?
Oh, I don't think it was one of your knives.
- Out of my alley.
- Why?
I don't want you here.
Out of my alley.
Get out of here!
My alley, get out!
- But there was a man murdered here.
- Get out.
- Out.
- There really was.
I'm telling you for the last time, get out of here.
You hear me?
Get out!
- So how'd you do?
- Excuse me?
How'd you do, bowling?
Not many people bowling at 9:45 in the morning.
Me?
I bowled 188 which is a significant improvement over my afternoon performance.
A theory I have about morning versus afternoon versus evening physical performance in humans.
I've found mornings, across the board yield better results in overall physical activity.
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Maybe our professional sporting teams should play each other in the morning.
Maybe the team that comes from the latest time zone has an unfair advantage.
And I'm not just talking about sports, I'm talking about any activity that requires physical exertion for a protracted period of time.
- You live around here?
- Excuse me?
- Wanna go to your place?
- What I just told you, it's only a theory.
- Now.
- I'll get my rosin bag.
- This seems like a very nice place.
- Thank you, I like it.
Direct-dial phone, in-room TV, queen-sized bed.
Direct-dial phone, huh?
Could you draw the drapes, please?
- Thank you.
- Wanna watch some in-room TV?
Would you give me a hand with this thing?
A hand?
What is it exactly you wanna do with this?
Put it in front of the door.
It's gonna make it kind of tough to get the paper in the morning.
Listen, I realize we hardly know each other but I was just
- I mean, we are in my hotel room moving furniture and all.
I was just kind of wondering, what's your name?
- Agnes.
- Douglas.
We're both S's.
Is someone chasing you?
Your husband?
I'm not married.
- Boyfriend?
- I don't have a boyfriend.
Not that I know of anyway.
Does this perhaps have something to do with your profession?
- What is it you do, Agnes?
- I work for a detective agency.
- No kidding.
- No kidding.
I answer the phones.
Which is how I got into this in the first place.
Because I wasn't happy just answering the phones.
So my boss, Maddie Hayes gave me these tickets to go to this dance, and I met this guy.
Guy?
Don't worry.
For one thing, I don't think I'm his type and for another, he's dead.
- Dead?
- Dead.
If you're a woman, death after the first date does not do a lot for your self-confidence.
What are you doing hanging around with people who die?
If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not talk about all that right now.
I'd really like to talk about something else.
So, what do you do?
Me?
I'm involved in the personal-services industry.
- I sell shoes.
- Shoes?
Shoes.
Everybody needs them.
Everybody uses them.
Everybody needs to replace them.
Shoes.
Yep.
I help keep America on its feet.
That's on a poster where I work.
- Do you like it?
- Shoes?
You may not have noticed, but I'm kind of short.
Low to the ground.
But for a shoe salesman, this is a big plus.
You're much closer to your product and where your product's gonna be used.
It's sort of my destiny.
You know, this isn't how I thought it was gonna be at all.
When I told Ms. Hayes that I wanted to do something exciting I thought it would all be less dangerous and more fun.
Why don't I give you something to drink.
Something to drink maybe.
You know what I should do?
I should try calling them.
I'll just tell them I'm here with you and-
Sorry, Agnes.
Hello?
What happened?
Did something happen?
Whatever it was, I didn't sleep through it, did I?
Nothing's happened.
I've just given you a shot of sodium pentathol.
Truth serum.
Truth serum?
To relax you help you lose your inhibitions, help you clear your mind, that's all.
Just listen to me, just think about what I'm asking you.
Douglas, I don't like this.
Here's the first question.
- Who do you work for?
- Well, David Addison hired me but I really work for Maddie Hayes.
We all work for Maddie Hayes.
And who's Maddie Hayes?
Has anyone ever told you that you have beautiful eyes?
It's important that you let me ask the questions, Agnes.
- You have a great mouth too.
- Thank you.
To the best of your knowledge, are either of them involved in espionage?
I just had a thought.
I bet you don't sell shoes for a living.
- Answer the question, Agnes.
- No.
I mean, "No, to the best of my knowledge neither of them are involved in espionage."
Not, "No, I won't answer the question."
Now you say something nice about me.
- Excuse me?
- It's your turn...
- ...to say something nice about me.
- It is?
I like what you're doing with your hair there.
It's very different, very nice.
But I don't do anything with my hair.
So you'd never met Kyle till he asked you to dance?
Kyle.
- What a gorgeous man.
- Answer the question.
You sound angry.
There's no reason to be angry.
I never met Kyle until he asked me to dance.
- Kyle danced great.
- I know.
- I saw you.
- You saw us?
- How could you have seen us?
- I was there.
Kyle and I worked together.
I was sort of his boss.
Wait a second.
So when you bumped into me at the bowling alley-
I knew somebody was after him.
I had to find out if it was you.
Are you guys spies?
Better get your coat.
GAYLORD APARTMENTS
- Where you wanna go?
- Straight to the top.
President of Blue Moon Detective Agencies.
No, I mean now.
Here in this cab.
Do I have to go somewhere?
There are things I have to do.
Work I have to attend to.
Don't worry, I'll see you again.
- You promise?
- Absolutely.
Well...
Will one of you tell me if this is gonna go on?
I'll start the meter.
- Why did you do that?
- I couldn't help myself.
I understand that.
Now, where do you live?
This thing between us is really zipping along, isn't it?
No.
I mean, so this man can drive you home.
- What's your address?
- Oh, 6338 Hope Street.
Isn't that a wonderful name for a street?
Hope Street.
That's why I moved there, because of the name.
Other than that, it isn't much of a place to live.
You're a very special woman, Agnes.
- Why have we stopped?
- Red light.
- 2151 Sherwood Way.
- Sorry, pal, I already have a fare.
That's okay, I don't mind sharing.
- Please.
- Thank you.
Although I still think it was rude of you, after I let you share my cab not to let me go where I wanted to go.
Stop that.
- Stop what?
- That!
That gibberish talk.
I don't believe it, and I don't believe you.
I know who you are.
You're Kyle's girl.
Or you were.
And now you're Doug's.
Doug's girl, Doug's contact.
- So give us the number.
- What number?
The bundle number.
The number of the bundle that contains the plans.
I'm sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about.
You know exactly what I'm talking about.
We've been smuggling plans out of High Castle Defense in laundry bundles.
Your people figured out what we were doing and planted a man here in the middle of the laundry.
- We did?
- We found out and killed your man but not before he was able to switch the bundle numbers on some very important plans.

The polka shoes too, but I ain't doing no bunny hop.
To know every week is gonna be the same as every other week.
A band whose idea of hot is playing "Born in the U.S.A." on the accordion.
- Answering the same phone.
- I have a confession.
- I don't wanna go.
- Where?
Were you talking to me?
What are you saying?
You first.
What were you talking about?
The California Investigators Association annual banquet.
You?
Ms. DiPesto.
She's been acting very strangely.
- How can you tell?
- She's depressed, sick of life.
- I'm worried.
- Don't worry.
She's just having an attack of UMS.
- UMS?
- Ugly mood swing.
A peculiarly feminine disease.
- About this banquet-
- Exactly, I don't wanna go.
- We're going, it's important.
- For what?
It's a chance to fight in public, but what else?
- Business.
- Business?
Business what?
Now, the Annual Convention of Wife Cheaters would be good for business.
- It'll be interesting.
- It'll be boring.
The only thing that could liven it up is a strip-search demonstration with you.
Addison thank you.
I think.
- We're going.
- Oh, come on, Maddie.
Being detectives is what we do all day, every day.
I don't wanna-
- Say that again.
- "That."
David, you've just given me a wonderful idea.
That strip-search thing?
How do you feel about barnyard animals?
Being detectives is what we do all day, but it's not what Ms. DiPesto does.
- Not what Ms. DiPesto does at all.
- Thank the Lord for small favors.
This could be exactly what she needs.
Are you suggesting sending DiPesto to this banquet?
There will be other banquets for us, but Agnes how many banquets are in her future?
- All right, you convinced me.
- I'll give DiPesto my ticket and you can be her escort.
Wait a second!
Maddie, we can't do that to Agnes.
- We can't?
- She shows up with me...
- ...she won't meet other men.
- Think so?
Yes, I know so.
Guys don't hit on other men's women.
It's like the rule, a code, like-
- Honor among thieves?
- Exactly like that.
Maddie, Agnes has gotta be free to network chitchat, knickknack, paddywack, give a dog a bone if she wants a guy to roll her home.
- You might be right.
- Might be?
Am be.
Definitely am be.
Maddie, it's time to let our little girl grow up.
So I vote no to the chaperone at the dance.
Give her the keys to the car and hey, let's forego the curfew, huh?
- You think so?
- Maddie I know this is very hard for you but there comes a time when you just have to let go.
David, let go.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you...
Ms. DiPesto, I just had an idea.
You ought to get somebody look at that.
Would you like to go to a soiree with a bunch of private dicks?
- Excuse me?
- What Mr. Addison is trying to say is I had an idea.
- You doing anything tonight?
- She is going to the California Investigators Association annual banquet.
- I am?
- You am.
- But I don't have a date.
- You don't need a date.
All you need's a ticket and something to wear.
- Don't have that either.
- But you will.
- I will?
- You will.
Remember, no plunging necklines or patent-leather shoes.
Go!
Oh, Ms. DiPesto.
Some kind of jam-up up ahead.
You mind if I let you out up here?
CALIFORNIA INVESTIGATORS ASSOC.
- Oh, my.
- Dance with me.
Excuse me?
Dance with me.
You have a name?
Yes.
What is it?
It's Elaine.
Well, Elaine, I really appreciate this.
Do you work in town?
The Blue Moon Detective Agency.
Why?
I wanna give you something.
Hold on to this number.
Elaine, how long can you hold your breath?
You mean, like in scuba?
Elaine, thanks a lot.
Don't mention it.
So...
- ...how'd it go?
- Oh, Ms. Hayes, it was nice.
Only nice, huh?
You meet somebody?
Oh, boy, what a body.
- Was he nice?
- Nicer than nice.
At first I thought he'd made a mistake and he meant to come up to somebody else-
Morning, children, what's the poop on the prom?
Ms. DiPesto met a man at the banquet.
No kidding, facial hair and everything?
That explains the smile.
- The smile?
- You should try it sometime.
- Perfect cure for UMS.
- UMS?
Urgently missing sex.
Excuse me, Ms. Hayes.
We'll talk at lunch?
I promise.
Blue Moon Detective Agency.
Say your pooch hasn't yet come home.
Called his name, bought him a new bone.
Give us a shot.
Mad and Dave will find Spot-
Elaine.
- How you doing, Elaine?
- Could you call back?
- I need to talk to you.
- You do?
You wanna go get something to eat?
- He's here.
- Who's here?
- He's here.
- He's here?
Him?
- He wants to take me to lunch.
- At a quarter after 9?
- Would it be okay?
- Sure it'd be okay.
Can I meet him?
Sure you can meet him.
Do me a favor, call me Elaine.
I'd like you to meet my employer.
- Madelyn Hayes.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- We've really gotta go.
- Well, it was nice meeting you, Mr...?
- Likewise.
Ms. DiPesto, have you seen my-?
- Where is she going?
- Lunch.
That the guy from last night?
- Big appetite.
- What is that supposed to mean?
Come on, Maddie.
A man, a woman.
- A nooner.
- A what?
Or in this case, a niner.
This is nice.
This is different.
I never knew this was here.
They serve good food here?
- Listen, about last night...
- That was something, huh?
I mean, I don't know what a guy like you was doing...
- ... dancing with a girl like me, but-
- Look, I appreciate what you did.
If you hadn't been so pleasant about everything...
I love to dance.
Only wish you hadn't disappeared so fast, though.
If you hadn't given me your number I was afraid I'd never see you again.
- I don't even know your name.
- It's Kyle.
About that piece of paper.
The one with all the numbers on it.
I must have called it about 600 times.
I need it back.
The piece of paper, I need it back.
Telephone call for Agnes DiPesto at the front desk.
- Telephone for Agnes DiPesto.
- How about that.
Somebody's paging my sister.
I'll be right back.
Yeah.
Hello?
Hello?
Excuse me, sir, are you sure somebody called me?
- There's nobody here.
- Maybe they hung up.
Then why did they call me?
Maybe they're from that show, In Search of...
Between the time they called and you picked up they found what they were looking for.
- Excuse me.
- That's okay.
I liked it.
- Don't scream.
- Don't scream?
Mister?
Please, come quickly, hurry.
- What's the trouble?
- Please!
There's something wrong with my date.
Not much I can do about that.
No, you don't understand.
It's like he's dead, lifeless.
Some guys, average bowlers, you buy them a ball...
No, I mean he's really dead.
And I came back from the phone and-
Oh, my goodness.
He was right there.
He had his head down on the table and he had a knife in his chest.
- Maybe he wandered off.
- With a knife in his chest?
Oh, I don't think it was one of your knives.
- Out of my alley.
- Why?
I don't want you here.
Out of my alley.
Get out of here!
My alley, get out!
- But there was a man murdered here.
- Get out.
- Out.
- There really was.
I'm telling you for the last time, get out of here.
You hear me?
Get out!
- So how'd you do?
- Excuse me?
How'd you do, bowling?
Not many people bowling at 9:45 in the morning.
Me?
I bowled 188 which is a significant improvement over my afternoon performance.
A theory I have about morning versus afternoon versus evening physical performance in humans.
I've found mornings, across the board yield better results in overall physical activity.
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Maybe our professional sporting teams should play each other in the morning.
Maybe the team that comes from the latest time zone has an unfair advantage.
And I'm not just talking about sports, I'm talking about any activity that requires physical exertion for a protracted period of time.
- You live around here?
- Excuse me?
- Wanna go to your place?
- What I just told you, it's only a theory.
- Now.
- I'll get my rosin bag.
- This seems like a very nice place.
- Thank you, I like it.
Direct-dial phone, in-room TV, queen-sized bed.
Direct-dial phone, huh?
Could you draw the drapes, please?
- Thank you.
- Wanna watch some in-room TV?
Would you give me a hand with this thing?
A hand?
What is it exactly you wanna do with this?
Put it in front of the door.
It's gonna make it kind of tough to get the paper in the morning.
Listen, I realize we hardly know each other but I was just
- I mean, we are in my hotel room moving furniture and all.
I was just kind of wondering, what's your name?
- Agnes.
- Douglas.
We're both S's.
Is someone chasing you?
Your husband?
I'm not married.
- Boyfriend?
- I don't have a boyfriend.
Not that I know of anyway.
Does this perhaps have something to do with your profession?
- What is it you do, Agnes?
- I work for a detective agency.
- No kidding.
- No kidding.
I answer the phones.
Which is how I got into this in the first place.
Because I wasn't happy just answering the phones.
So my boss, Maddie Hayes gave me these tickets to go to this dance, and I met this guy.
Guy?
Don't worry.
For one thing, I don't think I'm his type and for another, he's dead.
- Dead?
- Dead.
If you're a woman, death after the first date does not do a lot for your self-confidence.
What are you doing hanging around with people who die?
If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not talk about all that right now.
I'd really like to talk about something else.
So, what do you do?
Me?
I'm involved in the personal-services industry.
- I sell shoes.
- Shoes?
Shoes.
Everybody needs them.
Everybody uses them.
Everybody needs to replace them.
Shoes.
Yep.
I help keep America on its feet.
That's on a poster where I work.
- Do you like it?
- Shoes?
You may not have noticed, but I'm kind of short.
Low to the ground.
But for a shoe salesman, this is a big plus.
You're much closer to your product and where your product's gonna be used.
It's sort of my destiny.
You know, this isn't how I thought it was gonna be at all.
When I told Ms. Hayes that I wanted to do something exciting I thought it would all be less dangerous and more fun.
Why don't I give you something to drink.
Something to drink maybe.
You know what I should do?
I should try calling them.
I'll just tell them I'm here with you and-
Sorry, Agnes.
Hello?
What happened?
Did something happen?
Whatever it was, I didn't sleep through it, did I?
Nothing's happened.
I've just given you a shot of sodium pentathol.
Truth serum.
Truth serum?
To relax you help you lose your inhibitions, help you clear your mind, that's all.
Just listen to me, just think about what I'm asking you.
Douglas, I don't like this.
Here's the first question.
- Who do you work for?
- Well, David Addison hired me but I really work for Maddie Hayes.
We all work for Maddie Hayes.
And who's Maddie Hayes?
Has anyone ever told you that you have beautiful eyes?
It's important that you let me ask the questions, Agnes.
- You have a great mouth too.
- Thank you.
To the best of your knowledge, are either of them involved in espionage?
I just had a thought.
I bet you don't sell shoes for a living.
- Answer the question, Agnes.
- No.
I mean, "No, to the best of my knowledge neither of them are involved in espionage."
Not, "No, I won't answer the question."
Now you say something nice about me.
- Excuse me?
- It's your turn...
- ...to say something nice about me.
- It is?
I like what you're doing with your hair there.
It's very different, very nice.
But I don't do anything with my hair.
So you'd never met Kyle till he asked you to dance?
Kyle.
- What a gorgeous man.
- Answer the question.
You sound angry.
There's no reason to be angry.
I never met Kyle until he asked me to dance.
- Kyle danced great.
- I know.
- I saw you.
- You saw us?
- How could you have seen us?
- I was there.
Kyle and I worked together.
I was sort of his boss.
Wait a second.
So when you bumped into me at the bowling alley-
I knew somebody was after him.
I had to find out if it was you.
Are you guys spies?
Better get your coat.
GAYLORD APARTMENTS
- Where you wanna go?
- Straight to the top.
President of Blue Moon Detective Agencies.
No, I mean now.
Here in this cab.
Do I have to go somewhere?
There are things I have to do.
Work I have to attend to.
Don't worry, I'll see you again.
- You promise?
- Absolutely.
Well...
Will one of you tell me if this is gonna go on?
I'll start the meter.
- Why did you do that?
- I couldn't help myself.
I understand that.
Now, where do you live?
This thing between us is really zipping along, isn't it?
No.
I mean, so this man can drive you home.
- What's your address?
- Oh, 6338 Hope Street.
Isn't that a wonderful name for a street?
Hope Street.
That's why I moved there, because of the name.
Other than that, it isn't much of a place to live.
You're a very special woman, Agnes.
- Why have we stopped?
- Red light.
- 2151 Sherwood Way.
- Sorry, pal, I already have a fare.
That's okay, I don't mind sharing.
- Please.
- Thank you.
Although I still think it was rude of you, after I let you share my cab not to let me go where I wanted to go.
Stop that.
- Stop what?
- That!
That gibberish talk.
I don't believe it, and I don't believe you.
I know who you are.
You're Kyle's girl.
Or you were.
And now you're Doug's.
Doug's girl, Doug's contact.
- So give us the number.
- What number?
The bundle number.
The number of the bundle that contains the plans.
I'm sorry, but I don't know what you're talking about.
You know exactly what I'm talking about.
We've been smuggling plans out of High Castle Defense in laundry bundles.
Your people figured out what we were doing and planted a man here in the middle of the laundry.
- We did?
- We found out and killed your man but not before he was able to switch the bundle numbers on some very important plans.
What makes you think I have this number?
The man who infiltrated us was Kyle.
And we know that Kyle passed the number on to you.
- He did?
- At the dance.
Just like he was supposed to, just as you had planned it.
So, what is it?
I don't know.
- I don't know.
- The number!
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.
Last night I went to this reception, a man asked me to dance.
This morning he took me to coffee and got killed.
This other man shot me with truth serum.
The two of you hijacked my cab.
I don't know what's going on.
I don't know anything.
I'm nobody's contact.
Nobody's girl.
I answer phones.
I'm a lady who answers phones.
Do you think I could use the facilities?
Let's not make a career of it.
How we doing in there?
Did you fall in?
Get back here, you!
Hey, you!
COLD WATER RINSE
Here.
What good's a romantic hero if he's not there when you need him?
- Doug!
- Everything's gonna be fine.
Agnes, just stay calm.
You're perfectly safe up there.
Doug!
Doug!
Doug!
HOT WATER RINSE
Doug!
- Thanks!
- Don't mention it.
Agnes!
Are you okay?
Here we go again.
Thanks, Lou.
- You know him?
- Yeah, he works for me too.
Agnes, what's that?
Doug, don't get upset.
This is Kyle's phone number.
- He gave it to me last night.
- Kyle's number?
And this laundry bundle was filled with plans?
Honest Injun.
Agnes, you understand, you won't be able to tell anyone about what went on today.
National security.
Yeah, no.
National security.
I'm sorry you had to get involved.
You are?
Well...
Well?
Well...
You got any more of that truth stuff with you?
No.
Guess we'll have to do without.
Here she comes.
I gotta be honest, I never thought she had it in her.
- David, we don't know what happened.
- Come on, she left 24 hours ago.
- She had more than a tuna sandwich.
- Will you stop?
Face it.
Her nooner became an afternooner, which became a nighter which probably became an overnighter.
Morning, Ms. Hayes.
Morning, Mr. Addison.
- Morning, Ms. DiPesto.
- Morning, Ms. DiPesto.
Sorry I'm a little late.
Actually, I'm a lot late.
Kind of missed yesterday, didn't I?
I stopped over at the cleaner's.
You didn't have to do that.
- So?
- So?
So?
Did you at least get a nice dinner out of it?
David.
I'll tell you something.
I missed you guys.
I missed this place, I missed that phone.
Life is pretty good.
Yeah life is pretty good.
So she's not gonna share the intimate details?
- We better get back to work.
- We don't have any work.
We have to tell the writers to write bigger parts...
- ...for next week's episode.
- I'll buy that.
- Special delivery for an Agnes DiPesto.
- I'm Agnes DiPesto.
Sign here.
Thank you.
Dear Agnes:
Unfortunately, I had to leave Los Angeles this morning.
Of course, I can't tell you where I'm going and I can't tell you when I'll be back.
The truth is I can't tell you much of anything except how terrific I think you are.
Thinking of you, Doug.
Bakery.
Ms. DiPesto of Blue Moon.
You know my usual jelly?
Make it a cruller.
Manon of the Spring
Jean de Florette Part Two.
Here.
Next time, I won't pay this much.
The competition from Italy is ruining me.
This barely pays for the fertilizer for the flowers.
Next year, we'll grow chickpeas.
I'd miss our aperitifs together.
What is it?
What are you barking at?
I'm not going to steal your goats.
Leave my bread alone!
Here, we'll share my lunch.
Hold on!
Hold on!
Leave some for me!
Come on!
It's not me.
It's him.
Go ahead.
- Hello, chaps!
- Hello.
What did you do today, Bernard?
I went for a walk in the hills.
Look what I found.
Lignite.
The hills are full of it.
Interesting.
I saw some goats, too.
That's the herd of the hunchback's girl.
The little savage?
She's been hiding from us since her father died.
I've seen her.
She's a real beauty.
She must take after her mother.
For a hunchback, he had a lovely daughter.
Who was this hunchback?
You never met him, Mr. Belloiseau.
You didn't live here then.
He was a city intellectual who wanted to be a farmer.
- He was a loony!
- I'm not so sure of it.
I'm not saying he was an idiot, but he just wasn't practical.
He thought he could breed rabbits by doing multiplications on paper.
Only because there was no water at Romarins.
But you found some.
How's the flower trade?
Christmas and Shrove Tuesday are best, and Easter is pretty good, too.
And the dead?
Aren't they good business?
Not bad at all.
They bring in a certain amount.
Come along!
Come along!
Let's go.
Hurry up!
Thank you.
There's a letter for you.
My darling, tonight, we're playing A'l'da in Bordeaux.
I've only got a small part, but I'm so pleased.
If only you were with me, I'd be truly happy.
Your loving mother.
You can't stay here forever.
You should be with your mother.
No hare or rabbit or birds.
Where have they got to?
Maybe I'm going deaf and blind.
Next time, I'll bring a hound along.
That hare won't get away!
Galinette!
Hey!
Do you know it's 5:00?
That's some nap.
I think I got sunstroke.
No, you're not red.
You must be short of sleep.
Come outside.
She can't hear, but she guesses everything.
What I have to say to you concerns only us two.
Galinette, you're past 30, and you're the last of the Soubeyrans.
I know all that...
Don't interrupt!
If I keep saying it, it's your fault.
I'll say it until you understand.
We Soubeyrans were this region's most important family.
- On Grandpa's birthday...
- There were 30 of you.
All Soubeyrans, with cans of gold hidden throughout the house.
Everyone respected us.
It didn't last, but don't blame me.
That's fate.
No!
There's no such thing as fate!
Good-for-nothings always blame fate!
It was the fault of our elders.
Because of pride and greed, they married among themselves.
Cousins married cousins.
An uncle married his niece.
It's bad for rabbits, and it's bad for people.
And what was the result?
Two madwomen and three suicides.
Now there's only the two of us.
I don't count anymore, so you're what's left of the Soubeyrans.
You want me to marry.
Why didn't you take a wife?
I wasn't cut out for it.
Mind you, I almost did, but it didn't work out.
I joined the army in Africa on a whim.
When I came back...
If there had been a child, I'd gladly have married her, but it didn't happen.
I'm like Anglade's cherry tree.
Lots of blossoms but never any fruit.
So I should marry instead of you.
You have to, Galinette.
- But why?
Why?
- Why?
You're asking me why?
What about the Soubeyran fortune?
This isn't paper money we're talking about.
It's gold!
Cans full of gold coins.
Understand?
And I own them!
That's from savings, skimping and hard work.
You'd throw it all away?
Of course not.
I love gold.
Then don't leave it without an owner.
You can't ask me to start a family just like that.
I've asked you for 10 years.
But not as seriously as today.
Besides, I have my own ideas.
You have someone in mind?
Maybe.
Won't you tell me who?
Listen, I was in the sun all day.
I feel woozy.
I'll tell you, but be patient.
Fine.
You're a good boy, Galinette.
Just one more thing.
In choosing a wife, think of the children.
What do you mean?
Don't be enticed by a pretty face.
What we need is wide hips, long legs, and nice, big tits.
It's like choosing a brood mare.
What if she's also pretty?
If it's on top of it all, I wouldn't mind.
On the contrary, she'd be the Soubeyran beauty.
I'd enjoy looking at her.
Come on!
Come on!
Over here, Noé!
Come!
Why is it always my turn?
The water is for everyone.
Cleaning the basin twice a year won't kill you.
This red sand and the dead leaves.
- People need clean water.
- So do vegetables.
This is strange.
It looks like clay, but it's not.
No, it's bauxite powder, a mixture of iron and aluminum.
Where does it come from?
From the spring, after big storms.
It settles here and never reaches the village.
After a rainy night, my spring water turns red, and the stones look rusty.
It is rust.
It's iron oxide.
- Then it can't hurt.
- No, it's actually good.
Where's your spring in relation to this tank?
What do you mean?
Is it higher up or below?
That's hard to say.
The Romarins Valley is higher up.
Then the village water comes from the same valley.
It's 10:00.
I promised they'd have water by noon!
That's two hours away.
But it takes an hour to reach the village!
I enjoy your company, but I must report to the Mayor.
Don't keep him waiting.
Hey, someone's throwing stones!
Wasn't that lightning?
You saw lightning?
You must have started drinking very early.
I swear I drank only coffee this morning.
This is my knife.
I lost it a few days ago.
- Around here?
- No.
I haven't been here before.
That's strange.
The shepherdess returned it to you.
- Where is she?
- What shepherdess?
You mean Manon?
Yes, the hunchback's Manon.
Who else?
- Is she hiding here?
- No, she ran away.
Too bad.
I wanted to thank her.
Some other time.
- Thank her with a little kiss.
- It's funny.
I don't know her, but I dreamt about her.
In my dream, I even kissed her.
Did she let you?
In my dreams, women don't resist me.
- Aren't you eating?
- I'm not hungry.
You haven't looked well lately.
I've lost my appetite.
It's probably from that poison.
What poison?
The one I spray on my carnations to kill the red spiders.
- I'll do it for you.
- No.
It has to be done at night.
Daylight is no good for it.
It weakens it.
It kills its effectiveness.
You work nights, but you don't sleep days.
You're never home.
What do you do all day?
I hunt.
I walk around on the hill.
I breathe in the fresh air.
I need to clear my lungs of the poison.
That's true.
It's good for the carnations but bad for you.
Still, you should eat and sleep.
Want a doctor?
No, I'll be all right.
See?
I'm eating.
She's going to Aubagne to sell my birds.
He's nuts.
Who is it?
- It's me.
- I know that!
- Who is the woman?
- What woman?
The one you visit in Aubagne.
I've watched you for days.
You keep collecting birds.
What for?
Are you going mad or what?
Are you in love?
That's a good sickness.
Who is she?
You won't tell me.
Then she's either a tramp or she's married.
Yes, yes, that's it!
She's married!
She's married!
She's married!
- Open up!
- No, I won't!
- We can talk through the door.
- Why?
If I don't see you, I might tell you.
You're as dopey as your poor father.
Now, tell me.
I don't want to tell you anything.
Ask me questions.
Tell me who she is.
I won't tell you that.
Is it a city girl?
- Quite the opposite.
- Even better.
Do I know her?
Not really.
What does that mean?
You're too clever.
After four questions, you'll know.
- Then I do know her.
- See?
You know I don't want to tell you, but you insist on interrogating me!
- Well, I won't answer!
- Why not?
Because!
It's my secret.
It's my first love secret, and I'm keeping it.
Keep it.
I'm leaving.
Goodbye.
No!
Stay!
I want to talk about her.
I don't even know who she is.
But I do, so I like talking about her.
Papet, did you leave?
No, I'm rolling a cigarette.
So you want to marry her?
Yes, but she won't want me.
- Why?
- She's pretty, and I'm ugly.
Does she have money?
Not much.
Is she healthy?
Yes, she's strong as a horse and has good little muscles.
She would do a better job on my carnations than me.
- And she's educated, too.
- How do you know?
She's always reading books.
Sometimes for a whole hour.
That's no good.
A poor girl who reads books.
I don't like it.
Besides, a beautiful wife could mean trouble.
- Is she honest?
- She's the Holy Virgin of the hills.
If she'd marry me, I'd be happy as a king, but she won't.
No poor girl ever rejected a Soubeyran, unless she's crazy.
If she said yes, would you consent?
I can't say until I know who she is.
You idiot!
Open up and tell me!
I won't open the door!
I have to think!
- Papet?
- Yeah?
I may tell you, but first, swear by all the Soubeyrans that when you hear her name, you won't say a word.
- As you like.
- No!
Swear it!
I swear it by all the Soubeyrans.
Good.
Now I have to decide.
I won't open the door.
I'll take out the key.
Papet, put your ear next to the keyhole.
It's Manon, the hunchback's daughter.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
In 20 years' time, she'll think you're too old for her, and she might be unfaithful.
Not a girl like her.
She's like all the others, but never mind.
By then, you'll have a house full of sturdy little Soubeyrans.
Since she's pretty, I give my consent.
- You've seen her?
- Yes, I have.
- What's your opinion?
- She's very pretty.
She seems mature for her age.
She looks at least 18.
- You know who she looks like?
- Nobody!
Oh, yes.
She looks like someone you never knew.
She looks exactly like her grandmother.
You knew her grandmother?
Florette Camoins, the beauty.
Miss, I'm glad to meet you.
I wanted to thank you for my knife.
How did you know it was mine?
I saw you eating with it one day.
I'm the new teacher.
I'm collecting minerals from the hills to teach my pupils the composition of their land.
I thought you were looking for gold.
It's Jurassic cretaceous from the second Quaternary era.
You're well-informed for a shepherdess.
I'm just quoting my dad.
I'd like you to keep this.
I've got one.
- That one's too fancy for me.
- Not at all.
A shepherdess should have a shepherd's knife.
It has four blades, an awl and a nail file.
And small scissors.
I know because I used them.
It's the first one I snared.
It's a baby.
The big ones get away.
That hare is my present to you.
My class starts soon.
I have to leave.
I'll leave this on a rock.
Someone is bound to find it.
She doesn't want your knife.
Mister!
I'll keep it if you take the hare.
All right.
Thanks.
Pa pet?
What?
How does one talk to girls?
I don't know any words of love.
So you've made up your mind?
Yes, I must hurry.
She could meet a man in Aubagne who might take her from me.
Where will you court her?
In the hills.
I'll pretend to look for mushrooms or snails as if I didn't see her.
Not so fast.
If you're looking for mushrooms or snails, it makes you seem poor.
If you're rich, show it.
Don't wear your old clothes.
Wear a new suit, a real hunting outfit, with leather leggings and a matching hat.
And above all, wear suspenders.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a hare I shot.
It must be wounded.
Aren't you Manon, the daughter of Monsieur Jean?
I see you don't remember me.
That's because I've changed a lot.
I'm Ugolin, your poor father's friend.
You've changed, too.
You're a real young lady.
I hardly recognize you.
You may wonder why we never met before.
I'm too busy to hunt because of my carnations.
Did you know I grow carnations?
I've been very successful.
I've earned lots of money.
The money's all in gold coins!
In two years, with my savings, I'll be worth 50,000 francs.
Would you like to move back to Romarins?
I'd stay in my Massacan house, and you and Baptistine can tend my carnations.
Manon, listen to me!
I know why you don't want to.
It's because you're proud, but your pride is no problem.
Carnations need watering, picking, and women know all about that.
I'll pay you!
I'll pay you very well!
Manon!
Manon!
Manon!
It isn't to have you work.
I was lying.
It's because I love you.
I love you, Manon.
I love you with all my heart.
Manon!
I want to marry you.
I'm all alone.
I have no one.
My grandparents are dead.
My father hanged himself when I was little.
My mother died of the flu.
There's only Uncle Papet!
He's rich!
He's old!
He's going to die!
He'll leave it all to me.
It'll be yours because I love you!
I love you.
My love for you is choking me, making me ill.
I saw you bathing in the water holes.
I watched for hours.
You were so beautiful.
I was afraid I'd commit a crime!
- You spoke to her?
- I didn't see her.
She must have gone to Aubagne.
- Then do it tomorrow.
- Maybe.
First I've got to get used to this outfit.
You look great, like a hunter from Marseilles.
Look!
Do you see what I see?
A beautiful thrush.
That trap must belong to the hunchback's daughter.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
That's her herd.
She must be around here.
I won't touch it.
Other people's traps are sacred, especially hers.
That's her only livelihood.
She sells them at the Aubagne market.
She's proud.
We've already hurt her enough.
We didn't mean to.
We're not responsible.
We're all responsible.
We knew there was a spring at Romarins, but we said nothing.
Why didn't you speak up?
Because of Amélie.
- You want a bite?
- I sure do.
When I used to hunt at Romarins,
I'd see that poor hunchback look for water with his rod.
Once he was right above it, but the rod didn't bend.
Then he dug in the wrong spot.
That night, I was upset, so I told Amélie.
What a scene!
She flew into a rage.
"It's none of our business!
Hunchbacks are bad luck!
"He's an outsider from Crespin!" And so on.
You know how she is.
She made me swear to say nothing.
- So you didn't?
- No.
Ugolin and Papet are real bastards.
Yeah, in that whole business, we were all bastards.
Come on!
Come along.
Papet!
My spring stopped running!
- What?
- No water!
- None at all?
- No.
I dug down deep.
Not a drop!
- The carnations are budding!
- Fifteen thousand of them.
- You still have the well.
- The well will be empty in two days!
Springs are capricious, especially his.
Give it three months.
Three months!
Holy mother!
Stop it, you fool!
Get up!
The water is probably back by now, and if not, with a few mules, we can hold out.
- Let's go take a look.
- It used to flow.
When the hunchback came, it stopped.
Then...
Something's wrong with our fountain.
It's just trickling.
- Come and see!
- That's not possible.
- Here, too!
Papet, we're ruined!
- Calm down.
Well?
Could be a frog or a snake inside.
We're stuck, like Ugolin.
Impossible!
It hasn't stopped running in 50 years.
I'll go check out the tank.
Nothing.
- There.
- I'm on my way.
Don't worry.
Monsieur Jean, have mercy.
You're up in heaven, so you can see that my feet are so swollen that I can't wear shoes, that my mule is half-dead.
If this continues, my carnations will be ruined in eight days.
Come on, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, give us back your daughter's spring.
Amen.
Help us!
Amen, damn it!
Hello?
Yes, I'm the Mayor.
When will you get here?
Tomorrow?
We'll all be dead!
He must come right away!
We have no bread.
Our crops are ruined.
It's a disaster!
Then I'll expect him tomorrow at the town hall.
Thank you.
- The expert is coming tomorrow.
- What expert?
The one I keep asking for, the rural-engineering expert.
The meeting will come to order.
This council meeting concerns the water problem.
- Problem?
It's a disaster!
- That's right.
It's a disaster, but thanks to my own efforts and my telephone,
I was able to get us a rural expert, and here is the rural expert.
Gentlemen, I have studied your problem, and here's the report I'm submitting to my chief engineer.
The Perdrix Spring which supplied your fountain was the main source for this whole region.
It originated from a fissure between two layers of limestone.
The source is not diaclastic.
It is a vauclusian resurgence.
Let's not confuse the two.
Thus, the water bed between two impervious strata leveled out, and the water issued forth along the upper stratum, under pressure.
This trapped pool supplied your basin by rising up, and the basin supplied your fountain through a series of pipes.
Yes, it's serious!
At the request of your mayor and the administration, we researched the cause of this terrible accident.
First, where did your water originate?
- Luckily we have this document.
- Very interesting!
It's a study by the chief engineer that spells out clearly and to the point some experiments made in this region five years ago.
Unfortunately, your spring does not appear on this valuable map.
There's no stream within the orography of the Huveaune River or its tributaries.
Fine.
Where does that leave us?
Since the water doesn't originate locally, it comes from far away.
- I want to speak.
- Not now!
I'll make it short.
Just let him turn on the water!
He can explain later!
I don't fix fountains.
The first theory is the drought.
A small drop in the groundwater level may have caused your problem.
The watercourse is determined by seams of dolomite in the limestone.
It can cross the seams via a network of siphons.
You know what that is?
It's a rubber tube to draw wine!
Exactly.
At the first rain, the siphons are reactivated as soon as the underground lake rises to its normal level.
An underground lake?
Of course!
To oppose progress is a sure sign of ignorance.
If progress gets me my water back, I'm for it, and if my spring flows again, here's my 100 francs for progress!
Here's 100 francs for progress!
Wait.
Listen to the rest of this nonsense.
Now, the second theory.
The underground stream dropped into a network of caves.
Once they're filled, the water returns to its old level and the spring flows again.
How soon?
I can't tell you how long it might take.
Maybe two days, maybe two years.
- Maybe 100 years.
- That can't be ruled out.
Third theory...
To hell with your theories!
What can you do for us right now?
The administration will provide a daily truck with 1,300 gallons of water
to cover your immediate daily needs.
How much water do I get for my carnations?
If our water hasn't returned in a month, what then?
We suggest you farm some land elsewhere.
What can I say?
Lots of villages have plenty of water.
No, sir, our council can't accept that!
Your council's power over natural phenomena is next to zero.
- The third theory...
- To hell with their theories!
We've got some administration!
And I say to hell with you!
The water truck will be here in two days.
Meanwhile, gentlemen, goodbye!
Quiet, or else they'll send the police!
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where's the president of the water syndicate?
Who is the president of the water syndicate?
It's not me.
It's you!
I am because I'm the Mayor, and that's because I have the phone!
And what is this?
- Your receipt.
- Right.
Right, 52 francs, plus the stamp.
You took my money.
Now where's my water?
Before you came, the expert explained about the orography.
You have to understand orography.
I don't give a damn!
- I paid, and I want my water!
- Listen.
They're sending a water truck every day.
Bring your mule, and you'll get 40 gallons like the rest of us.
First, I have no mule, only a donkey.
Second, 40 gallons will do for a café, not for a field.
Third, I paid for spring water, not truck water!
I'm sure they'll send spring water.
Not from my spring!
I paid, and I want my water!
Stop yelling!
It's exhausting us, and it won't help!
Holy mother!
My poor eggplants!
My 600 beefsteak tomato plants!
Everyone is affected.
It's a major disaster.
"Major"?
I paid, and I want my water!
The spring stopped running.
Where should we get water?
Who cares?
Just make it run from my pipe.
And you, mind your own business!
You're a councilman, but I didn't vote for you!
- I don't need your vote!
- Who do you think you're talking to?
A bunch of water thieves!
- Stop it!
Stop it!
- Stop!
- Stop!
- Stop it!
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Today is my birthday.
After Mass, you're invited for a drink.
We don't control what day we're born.
My brothers, I am truly glad to see you all gathered in our little church.
The whole parish is here, including a group of intellectuals who normally observe Holy Mass on the terrace of a café.
I won't name it.
It's our only café.
I won't name them, either.
You all know them.
This ought to fill them with shame, were it not for their cynicism.
With clasped hands and moist eyes, you're full of faith and repentance today, but God knows you're here because your spring stopped running, and your prayers are merely pleas for your string beans, orations for your tomatoes, hallelujahs for your artichokes,
hosannas for your squash!
I must speak seriously about the spring.
I keep asking myself the same question.
Why is it that this water, so plentiful until now, has suddenly dried up in our hour of need?
I once read a Greek tragedy about the City of Thebes, which was struck by a calamitous plague because of crimes committed by its king.
So I ask myself,
"ls there a criminal among us?"
It's not impossible, since the biggest crimes often escape human justice, but God knows of them all.
I'll now speak to this unknown criminal, if he exists.
To him I say,
"My brother, there's no sin that cannot be forgiven,
"no crime that cannot be atoned for
"by sincere repentance."
Our Lord Jesus Christ said this astounding phrase,
"There is more room in heaven for one repentant sinner
"than for 100 self-righteous men."
Whatever your offense, try to make amends.
Repent, and you shall be saved, and your spring will flow better than before.
- Papet.
- Yes.
He knows.
He looked at me three times.
What could he know?
He's only been here a year.
Maybe somebody told him in confession.
Anglade might have.
He's such a bigot that he might confess other people's sins.
- What worries me is the girl.
- Me, too.
She seemed unfriendly to you.
She seemed to be saying, "You're the criminal."
No, she doesn't know anything, either.
Then what worries you?
I think she doesn't want you.
CITY OF AUBAGNE
Happy birthday.
- To our teacher's good health!
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday!
- Here's to you!
What did you think of the sermon?
What do you expect?
It's just a lot of words.
I'm sure no act of God dried up the spring.
He seemed to allude to a crime he knew of.
Maybe he heard of it in confession and couldn't reveal more.
What crime?
If anyone here committed a crime, we'd all know.
No, I felt he had someone in mind.
- Then who?
- Yes, who?
He kept looking at Ugolin.
Yes, especially when he spoke of the plague.
- Are you saying I have the plague?
- Don't joke about such things.
- You smelled our Pernod!
- I came because of the water.
I have to speak to you.
It's very important.
- To me?
- Yes.
You can bring the water back.
I could?
How?
By coming to the procession.
Will you?
Then our fountain won't ever flow again.
You think she's a saint?
An orphan's prayer soars to heaven like a lark.
Our Lord will gladly listen to her song.
She's innocent.
If she prays for us, we're saved.
Manon, you must save our carnations!
I won't help those who stole my father's water!
I don't understand.
They understand.
They know why God is punishing them.
Tell us.
Do you know who the criminal is?
There are two.
There they are.
If we're to be treated like criminals,
I'd rather go home.
Come, Galinette.
Your hurried departure might make us think...
I don't care what you think!
My conscience is clear.
Let's go.
- Come on.
- No.
I want to hear what she's accusing me of because I can solve the whole problem.
Tell me how they stole your father's water.
But she's imagining things.
It's true her father's lack of water may have ruined him.
He would have found water, except for his accidental death.
The two women were in trouble, so we bought the little farmland.
Partly because we liked it, true, but also to help them out.
Later, we searched for the spring and, by sheer luck, we found it.
That's what she calls stealing his water.
"Help thy neighbor." Some joke!
Let's go!
It's not true.
He's lying!
The truth is the spring was always there.
The truth is you blocked it off.
- Why would they do that?
- To buy it cheap.
Without water, the farm is worthless.
My father's dead, thanks to these assassins!
That's not true!
That's slander!
I found that spring with my watch.
You were there with your mother.
You held a squash.
- Tell the truth!
- Within less than an hour?
The spring might well say to you what God said to Pascal,
"You wouldn't look for me unless you'd already found me."
To hell with Pascal!
I only met him once.
He was so rude, I slapped him!
You laugh, but it's true.
Here's what we have.
She denies what she saw and believes what she didn't see.
Who saw us block up that spring?
Who saw us block up that spring?
I saw you.
I saw you both.
Liar!
What did you see, idiot?
You could never even tell left from right.
In the army, they put a mark on his left hand and two on his right.
He never understood, so they sent him home.
I planned it that way.
It wasn't easy, but it worked.
The Major had his suspicions...
We're not interested in that right now.
Tell us what you saw.
He saw nothing.
He was dreaming.
I never dream!
It was nine or 10 years ago.
- See?
He's being vague.
- It was after Pique-Bouffigue died.
I was at Romarins, hunting partridge.
They were drinking from a puddle near the empty farmhouse.
- I picked the lock, went upstairs...
- How nice!
Breaking into a dead man's house.
Pique-Bouffigue built two small windows under the gutter to shoot thrush.
First, I took a nap.
You see?
He slept.
He was dreaming.
That was no dream!
Suddenly, I heard digging sounds and woke up.
I watched through the window.
This one was digging, while the other watched.
I didn't dare move.
The water gushed out of the hole.
Then they blocked the spring with cement!
Why didn't you tell her father?
It wasn't my business, but now God is punishing them and us.
Now it is my business!
Suppose he's telling the truth, and it's not true, but if it were,
I'm willing to give her the spring, my carnations, the farm, the money, the Soubeyran fortune, my life.
You know it.
I told you so in the hills.
I love you more than anything.
Listen.
Listen to me, Manon.
I see you and talk to you constantly.
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.
If you don't want me, I'll die or go crazy.
Shut up, idiot.
Let's go.
Just think about it.
What a terrible mixture!
All my remorse for the harm I've caused you and all the happiness I'd like to bring you.
Don't you know how I'd slave for you?
- Oh, my love!
- Make him go away!
My love...
Don't be a fool.
Get up.
Think, Manon.
Just think.
I'll die over this love, and nobody will care.
Galinette, come on home.
No!
It's all your fault!
I lost everything because of you!
If I had known...
Galinette, my boy!
I'll stay.
Since you're all against him, I'll defend him.
That won't be easy.
You all know there never was a spring at Romarins, just a puddle,
but I found the real spring!
Those of you who are natives like me, admit that there was no spring.
Listen carefully.
If you knew of a spring and didn't tell the hunchback, then you're responsible for his death.
- The old bastard.
- You knew?
Sure.
We all knew.
We didn't dare denounce them to defend an outsider.
He hated my grandmother.
They took it out on her son.
Who's your grandmother?
Florette.
They never forgave her for marrying a man from Crespin.
Florette was your grandmother?
The hunchback was Florette's son?
Sir!
Sir!
Papet wants to see you and the Mayor.
- Papet wants to see you.
- Yes?
- You, too.
- Me?
He said to hurry.
- Where is he?
- At Romarins.
He's waiting for you.
What could César want?
Put him on the table.
Right there.
Go to the village.
Tell the mute woman to bring some candles from the church, at least six big ones,
and the linen sheet his grandmother wove.
Pamphile, prepare the coffin.
You'll find the oak boards in the attic, the ones I wanted for myself.
I know.
You're the one who ordered them.
Use them for him.
The rest of you, please, say he fell from a tree.
Keep this a secret for three days, or the priest won't give him a proper burial.
Now you can leave.
- I'm staying with you.
- There's no need to.
She should have married him and gotten her revenge by driving him crazy.
Papet, I'm leaving because I can't go on.
It's not the carnations.
It's because of my love.
I realize she'll never want me.
I suspected it because her ribbon burned my flesh, and when I told her in public I wanted to marry her, she spat at me in a fury.
What's more, she fled towards the teacher.
When he talks to her, she lowers her eyes.
When he stops, she lingers until he continues.
And he takes her love for granted.
He's unaware of his happiness, but I know my misery.
I can't stand it.
I'd like to kill him, but it would hurt her, and I'd never hurt her.
I leave her my farm and all that's hidden, you know where, to the left of the fireplace.
Don't make any trouble.
It's not her fault or yours.
It's fate.
Arrange a Mass for me because up there,
I'll have to explain about the spring.
Farewell, my Papet.
I'm sorry to leave you, but I can't stay.
You know?
I know.
What will you do?
I don't know.
I won't go back to that house.
Too many bad memories.
I'd keep seeing him hang where my swing used to be and smell his odor in the house.
Will you join the procession?
If you're sure that the water won't come back, you should go.
If your father could bring back the spring, what would he do?
He'd have liked to be their friend.
For his sake, do what he would have done.
- You think this procession will help?
- You never know.
I wonder how I would feel if the prayers worked.
I would feel terrible.
I would feel forced to go to confession.
That's what worries me.
I know several fools who'd think like you, and I'd surely lose the elections.
Miracles can be very convincing.
Something's happening.
Stop!
Stop!
It's breathing.
It's breathing!
The pipe is blowing!
A miracle!
Kneel!
On your knees!
Kneel down, everybody!
It's not a miracle.
It's just a coincidence.
I recognized your footsteps.
Your ear is as sharp as an eye.
Ears can't replace eyes, Cesar.
Belly dancing is all very well, but you made a mistake when you were over there.
I did?
I said "mistake," but it was almost a crime.
I don't know what mistake you mean.
When I was wounded, they almost promoted me.
That's a different matter.
I'm talking about a letter you received.
What letter?
One that deserved an answer, an answer that you never sent.
A letter from whom?
You don't want to tell me because you think I don't know.
- I swear, Delphine...
- Don't swear, you sinner!
I'm sorry for reminding you of something unpleasant.
What is unpleasant?
From here, I see the church and a cross on top of the steeple.
I swear on that cross that I received no letter, except from my father and Anglade and Castagne.
In that case, it's a tragedy.
Why?
Swear again that you're not lying to me.
I swear it.
Who wrote to me?
Florette.
Florette Camoins?
There was no other Florette.
Are you sure?
I myself gave the letter to the postman.
I'd never have forgotten a letter from her.
I still have two faded notes she wrote to me and one of her combs.
It's true.
When I came back, she had left the village.
She was married to the blacksmith in Crespin,
and she already had a child.
How could that letter have gotten lost?
Over there, we moved from place to place.
Sometimes, our food and even our ammunition failed to reach us.
Some letters may have been lost, too.
But if I had received that letter,
I would still know it by heart.
If that's true, it's dreadful.
- You think she loved me?
- You old fool.
She never told me so.
Not even after what happened between us one night in Anglade's barn.
That's how she was.
In her letter, she told you that she was pregnant.
- What?
- Yes.
You had left three weeks before.
She told you if you wrote to her father, promising to marry her, she would wait for you.
She could have shown your letter to the whole village, and nobody would have dreamed of making fun of her.
Are you sure?
The poor girl couldn't sleep.
She tried to lose the baby with devilish potions.
She jumped from high rocks in the hills, but nothing worked.
Then she started hating you.
She went to the dance at Aubagne, where she found the blacksmith from Crespin, so she left the village, and no one ever knew when the child was born.
Was it born alive?
Alive, yes, but it was a hunchback.
I hear Clairette coming back.
Come on over, my girl.
It's getting chilly.
I'd rather sit by the fireplace.
Farewell, César.
Don't worry.
I never told anyone.
I'm going to pray for you.
- What's wrong, Papet?
Are you ill?
- No, no.
Don't stand here.
Find some refuge.
- Should I call a doctor?
- No.
- I could call the Ombrées.
- No, thanks.
I know what's wrong with me.
Lean on me.
I'll take you home.
My friend, I don't believe you're about to die.
But I believe I am.
I know I'll die tonight.
What makes you think so?
I'll die because I no longer want to live.
Hurry and hear my confession.
You'll see.
I have lots to confess.
You know that suicide is a mortal sin.
I won't need to kill myself.
I'll simply pass away.
I need to get out.
I'd like to get out.
I'm sorry.
I need to get out.
Dear God, please don't let her baby be a hunchback.
Dear little Manon, the notary will tell you that I'm leaving you my whole estate.
It may surprise you, but it's the truth.
The lawyer will give you all the documents because your father was my son.
He was the Soubeyran I'd hoped for all my life, whom I tormented to death because I didn't know who he was.
If I had told him about the spring, he'd still be playing his harmonica, and you'd all be living in our family home.
No one knows it, but I'm too ashamed to face anyone, even the trees.
In the village, there's a person who knows.
She will tell you everything.
It's Delphine, the old blind woman.
She'll explain that it's all because of Africa.
I don't deserve to kiss you, and I never dared speak to you, but maybe now you can forgive me and even say a little prayer for poor Ugolin and me.
I'm so pathetic, I even pity myself.
Out of sheer spite, I never went near him.
I never knew his voice or his face.
I never saw his eyes, which might have been like his mother's.
I only saw his hump and the pain I caused him.
Now you understand why I want to die, because next to my torments, even hell would be a pleasure.
Besides, I'll see him up there.
I'm not afraid of him.
Now he knows he's a Soubeyran.
He's no longer a hunchback because of me.
He knows it was all a foolish mistake.
I'm sure that instead of blaming me, he'll defend me.
Farewell, my darling girl.
Your grandfather, César Soubeyran.
Next time I won't pay this much.
The competition from Italy is killing me.
This barely pays for the fertilizer.
Next year we'll grow chick-peas.
I'll miss having drinks with friends like you.
What's all this barking about?
I won't steal your herd.
Move over.
Leave me my bread!
Here, we'll share my lunch.
Well, now what will I eat?
Go on, move.
Bernard, what did you do today?
I explored the hill.
Look what I found.
Lignites.
This area is full of them.
Very interesting.
And I saw some unattended goats.
Must be the hunchback's daughter's herd.
I haven't seen the little savage since her dad died.
She hides from us.
I've seen her.
She's beautiful.
Her mother was a real beauty.
That hunchback hatched a lovely daughter.
Who was he?
You didn't know him.
It was before you moved here.
He was a city intellectual who played at being a farmer.
He was a nut.
He wasn't all that nutty.
I didn't say he was an idiot.
He just wasn't practical.
He tried breeding rabbits by multiplying numbers on paper.
Why?
Because he had no water.
But you found some.
Your carnations are doing well.
On holidays, mostly Christmas and Mardi Gras.
Easter is good too.
And the dead.
Aren't they good business?
Not bad.
Funerals bring good income.
Let's go.
Hurry up!
Thanks.
Here's a letter.
My darling...
Tonight we're doing Aida in Bordeaux.
I sing a small role, but I'm thrilled.
If only you were with me, I'd be truly happy.
Your loving mother.
You can't stay here forever.
You should go join your mother.
No hare or rabbit or partridge in sight.
Maybe I'm going deaf and blind.
Next time I'll bring the butcher's dog.
That hare won't get away!
Galinette!
Do you know it's five o'clock?
That's some nap.
I think I got sunstroke.
No, you're not red.
You must be needing sleep.
Come outside.
She can't hear, but she guesses everything.
What I'll say to you concerns only us two.
Galinette...
You're past 30, and you're the last of the Soubeyrans.
I know all that.
Don't interrupt!
If I keep saying it, it's your fault.
I'll say it until you understand.
We Soubeyrans were this region's most important family.
On Grandpa's birthday...
There were 30 of you.
All Soubeyrans, with cans of gold hidden throughout the house.
Everyone respected us.
It didn't last, but don't blame me.
That's fate.
There's no such thing as fate.
Good-for-nothings always blame fate!
It was the fault of our elders.
Because of pride and greed, they married among themselves.
Cousins married cousins.
An uncle married his niece.
That's bad for rabbits, and not good for people.
What's the result?
Two madwomen and three suicides.
Now there's only us two.
I don't count anymore.
So you're what's left of the Soubeyrans.
You want me to marry.
Why didn't you take a wife?
I wasn't cut out for it.
Mind you, I almost did... but it didn't work out.
I joined the army in Africa, on a whim... and when I came back...
If there had been a child, I'd gladly have married her.
But it didn't happen.
I'm like Anglade's cherry tree.
Many blossoms, but never any fruit.
So I should marry instead of you.
You have to, Galinette.
But why?
Why?
You're asking me why?
What about the Soubeyran fortune?
It's not banknotes that rats eat.
It's gold!
Cans full of gold coins.
Understand?
And I own them!
That's from savings, skimping and hard work.
You'd throw it all out?
Of course not.
I love gold.
Then don't leave it without an owner.
You can't ask me to start a family just like that.
I've asked you for ten years.
But not as seriously as today.
Besides, I have my own ideas.
You have someone in mind?
Maybe.
Won't you tell me who?
Listen, I was in the sun all day.
I feel woozy.
I'll tell you, but be patient.
Fine.
I like you, Galinette.
Just one more thing.
In choosing a wife, think of the children.
What do you mean?
Don't be enticed by a pretty face.
What we need is wide hips, long legs... and nice, big tits.
It's like choosing a brood mare.
What if she's also pretty?
If it's also, I won't mind.
On the contrary... she'd be the Soubeyran beauty.
I'd enjoy looking at her.
Over here, Noe!
Come!
Why is it always my turn?
The water is for everyone.
Cleaning the basin twice a year won't kill you.
This red sand and the dead leaves.
People need clean water.
So do vegetables.
This is strange.
Looks like clay, but it's not.
No... it's bauxite powder.
A mixture of iron and aluminum.
Where does it come from?
From the spring, after big storms.
It settles here... and never reaches the fountain.
After a rainy night... my spring water turns red and the stones look rusty.
It is rust, since it's iron oxide.
Then it can't hurt.
No.
It's actually good.
Where's your spring in relation to this basin?
What do you mean?
Is it higher up or below?
That's hard to say.
The Romarins valley is above here.
Then the village water comes from the same valley.
It's ten o'clock.
I promised they'd have water by noon!
That's two hours away.
But it takes an hour before it reaches the village.
I enjoy your company, but I must report to the mayor.
Don't keep him waiting, teacher.
Someone's throwing stones!
Wasn't that lightning?
You saw lightning?
You must have started drinking real early.
I swear I drank only coffee this morning.
That's my knife.
I lost it a few days ago.
- Around here?
- No.
I haven't been here before.
That's strange.
The shepherdess returned it to you.
- Where is she?
- What shepherdess?
- You mean Manon?
- The hunchback's Manon.
Who else?
Is she hiding here?
No, she ran away.
Too bad.
I wanted to thank her.
Some other time.
Thank her with a little kiss.
I don't know her, but I dreamt about her.
In my dream, I even kissed her.
Did she let you?
In my dreams, women don't resist me.
Aren't you eating?
I'm not hungry.
You haven't looked well lately.
I've lost my appetite.
Probably from that poison.
What poison?
The one I spray on my carnations... to kill the red spiders.
I'll do it for you.
No.
It has to be done at night.
Daylight is no good for it.
It weakens it.
It kills its effectiveness.
You work nights, but you don't sleep days.
You're never home.
What do you do all day?
I hunt.
I walk around on the hill.
I breathe in the fresh air... to clean out my lungs...
- from that poison.
- That's true.
It's good for the carnations, but bad for you.
Still, you should eat and sleep.
Want a doctor?
No.
I'll be all right.
See?
I'm eating.
She's going to Aubagne to sell my birds.
He's nuts.
Who is it?
It's me!
Yes, you're going crazy.
- Who is the woman?
- What woman?
The one you visit in Aubagne.
I've watched you for days.
You keep collecting birds.
What for?
I see you prancing and talking to yourself as if you're crazy!
Are you in love?
That's a good sickness.
Who is she?
You won't tell me.
Then she's either a tramp... or she's married.
That's it!
She's married!
She's married!
Open up!
No, I won't!
- We can talk through the door.
- Why?
If I don't see you, I might tell you.
You're as dopey as your poor mother.
Now, tell me.
I don't want to tell you anything.
Ask me questions.
Tell me who she is.
I won't tell you that.
A city girl?
Quite the opposite.
Even better.
Do I know her?
Actually, no.
What does that mean?
You're too clever.
After four questions, you'll know.
- Then...
I do know her.
- See?
I don't want to tell you.
You act like a cop, but I won't tell you.
Why not?
Because!
It's my secret.
My first love secret, and I'm keeping it.
Keep it.
I'm leaving.
Good-bye.
No!
Stay!
I want to talk about her.
I don't even know who she is.
But I do, so I like talking about her.
Papet, did you leave?
No.
I'm rolling a cigarette.
So, you want to marry her?
Yes, but she won't want me.
- Why?
- She's pretty and I'm ugly.
Does she have money?
Not much.
- Is she healthy?
- Yes.
She's strong as a horse and has good little muscles.
She would do a better job on my carnations than me.
And she's educated too.
How do you know?
She's always reading books.
Sometimes for a whole hour.
That's no good.
A poor girl who reads books.
I don't like it.
Besides, a beautiful wife could mean trouble.
Is she honest?
She's the Holy Virgin of the hills.
If she'd marry me, I'd be happy as a king.
But she won't.
No poor girl ever rejected a Soubeyran.
Unless she's crazy.
If she said yes, would you consent?
I can't say until I know who she is.
You idiot!
Open up and tell me!
I won't open the door!
I have to think!
Papet...
I may tell you, but first, swear by all the Soubeyrans... that when you hear her name, you won't say a word.
- As you like.
- No!
Swear it!
I swear it by all the Soubeyrans.
Good!
Now I have to decide.
I won't open the door.
I'll take out the key.
Put your ear next to the keyhole.
It's Manon, the hunchback's daughter.
Twenty years from now, you'll be too old for her.
- She'll have lovers.
- She wouldn't do that.
She's like all the others.
But never mind.
By then you'll have a house full of sturdy little Soubeyrans.
Since she's pretty, I give my consent.
You've seen her?
Yes, I have.
What's your opinion?
She's very pretty.
She seems mature for her age.
She must be 18 by now.
Know who she's like?
Nobody.
She looks like someone you never knew.
She looks exactly like her grandmother.
You knew her grandmother?
Florette Camoins... the beauty!
Miss, I'm glad to meet you... to thank you for my knife.
How did you know it was mine?
I saw you eating with it one day.
I'm the new teacher.
I'm collecting minerals in the hills... to teach my pupils the composition of their land.
There's no gold here.
It's Jurassic cretaceous from the second Quaternary era.
You're well-informed for a shepherdess.
I'm just quoting my dad.
I'd like you to keep this.
I've got one.
That one's too fancy for me.
No.
A shepherdess should have a shepherd's knife.
It has four blades, an awl and a nail file.
And small scissors.
I know, because I used them.
It's the first one I snared.
It's a baby.
The big ones get away.
That hare is my present to you.
My class starts soon.
I have to leave.
I'll leave this on a rock.
Someone is bound to find it.
She doesn't want your knife.
I'll keep it if you take the hare.
All right.
Thanks.
Papet...
How does one talk to girls?
I don't know any words of love.
So you've made up your mind?
Yes, I must hurry.
She could meet a man in Aubagne who might take her from me.
Where will you court her?
In the hills.
I'll pretend to look for mushrooms or snails... as if I didn't see her.
Not so fast.
If you're looking for mushrooms or snails... it makes you seem poor.
If you're rich, show it.
Don't wear your old clothes.
Wear a new suit, a real hunting outfit... with leather leggins and a matching hat.
And above all... wear suspenders.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a hare I shot that must be wounded.
Aren't you Manon, the daughter of Monsieur Jean?
I see you don't remember me.
That's because I've changed a lot.
I'm Ugolin... your poor father's friend.
You've changed too.
You're a real young lady.
I hardly recognize you.
You may wonder why we never met before.
I'm too busy to hunt because of my carnations.
Did you know I grow carnations?
I've been very successful.
I've earned lots of money.
The money's all in gold coins!
In two years, with my savings, I'll be worth 50,000 francs.
Would you like to move back to Romarins?
I'd stay in my Massacan house... and you and Baptistina can tend my carnations.
Manon, listen to me!
I know why you don't want to!
It's because you're proud.
But your pride is no problem.
Carnations need watering, picking, and women know all about that.
I'll pay you!
I'll pay you very well!
It isn't to have you work.
I was lying.
It's because I love you.
I love you with all my heart.
Manon!
I want to marry you!
I'm all alone.
I have no one!
My grandparents are dead!
My father hanged himself.
My mother died of the flu!
There's only Uncle Papet!
He's rich.
He's old!
He's going to die!
He'll leave it all to me, and it'll be yours!
Because I love you!
I love you!
My love for you is choking me... making me ill.
I saw you bathing in the water holes.
I watched for hours, you were so beautiful.
I was afraid I'd commit a crime!
- You spoke to her?
- I didn't see her.
She must have gone to Aubagne.
Then do it tomorrow.
Maybe.
First I've got to get used to this outfit.
You look great!
Like a hunter from Marseilles.
Look!
Do you see what I see?
A beautiful thrush.
That trap must belong to the hunchback's daughter.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
That is her herd.
She must be around here.
I won't touch it.
Other people's traps are sacred.
Especially hers.
That's her only livelihood.
She sells them at the Aubagne market.
She's proud.
We've already hurt her enough.
We didn't mean to.
We're not responsible.
We're all responsible.
We knew there was a spring at Romarins, but we said nothing.
Why didn't you speak up?
Because of Amelie.
- You want a bite?
- I sure do.
When I used to hunt at Romarins, I'd see... that poor hunchback look for water with his rod.
Once he was right above it, but the rod didn't bend.
Then he dug in the wrong spot.
That night I was upset... so I told Amelie.
What a scene!
She flew into a rage!
It was none of our business...
hunchbacks are bad luck... he was an outsider from Crespin, etc., etc.
You know how she is.
She made me swear to say nothing.
- So you didn't?
- No.
Ugolin and Papet are real bastards.
In that whole business, we were all bastards.
Papet!
My spring stopped running!
- What?
- No water!
None at all!
I dug down deep.
Not a drop!
Now what?
The carnations are budding!
- 15,000 of them.
- The well!
The well will be empty in two days.
Springs are capricious, especially yours.
- Give it three months.
- Three months!
Holy Mother!
Stop it, you fool!
The water is probably back by now.
And if not, with a few mules, we can hold out.
Let's take a look.
It used to flow.
When the hunchback came, it stopped.
Listen!
Something's wrong with our fountain.
It's just trickling.
Come and see!
That's not possible.
Here too!
Papet, we're ruined!
Calm down!
You see?
Could be a frog or a snake inside.
We're stuck, like Ugolin.
Impossible!
It hasn't stopped running in 50 years.
I'll go check out the basin.
Nothing!
I'm on my way.
Don't worry!
Monsieur Jean, have mercy.
You're up in heaven, so you can see... that my feet are so swollen that I can't wear shoes... that my mule is half-dead.
If this goes on, my carnations are ruined in eight days.
Come on.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost... give us back your daughter's spring.
Amen.
Help us!
Amen, damn it!
Yes, I'm the mayor.
When will you get here?
Tomorrow?
We'll all be dead!
He must come right away!
We have no bread.
Our crops are ruined.
It's a disaster!
Then I'll expect him tomorrow at the town hall.
The expert is coming tomorrow.
- What expert?
- The one I keep asking for!
The rural engineering expert.
The meeting will come to order.
This council meeting concerns the water problem.
Problem?
It's a disaster!
That's right, a disaster.
But thanks to my own efforts and my telephone...
I was able to get us a rural expert.
And here is the rural expert.
Gentlemen...
I have studied your problem... and here's the report I'm submitting to my chief.
Partridge Spring that fed your fountain... was the main source for this whole region.
It originated from a fissure between two layers of limestone.
The source is not diaclastic.
It is a Vauclusian resurgence.
Let's not confuse the two.
Thus, the water bed between two impervious strata leveled out... and the water issued forth along the upper stratum, under pressure.
This trapped pool supplied your basin by rising up... and the basin supplied your fountain through a series of pipes.
Yes, it's serious!
At the request of your mayor... and the administration... we researched the cause of this terrible accident.
First, where did your water originate?
Luckily we have this document.
Very interesting!
It's a study by the chief engineer... that spells out, clearly and to the point... some experiments made in this region five years ago.
Unfortunately, your spring does not appear on this valuable map... because it's not in the orography of the Huveaune River... or its tributaries.
Where does that leave us?
Since the water doesn't originate locally, it comes from far away.
I want to speak.
- Not now!
- I'll make it short!
Just let him turn on the water!
He can explain later!
I don't fix fountains.
The first theory is the drought.
A small drop in the ground water level may have caused your problem.
As the rising water is diverted by the parallel series of dolomites... and finally the Jurassic pattern... it should get through via a network of syphons.
You know what that is?
It's a rubber tube to draw wine.
Exactly.
At the first rain, the syphons are re-primed... as soon as the underground lake rises to its normal level.
An underground lake?
Of course!
And don't argue with progress.
You could be wrong.
If progress returns me my water, I'm for it!
And if my spring flows again, here's my 100 francs for progress!
Wait and hear the rest of this bullshit.
Now, the second theory.
The underground stream dropped into a network of caves.
Once they're filled... the water returns to its old level and the spring flows again.
How soon?
I can't tell you how long it might take.
Maybe two days... maybe two years.
Maybe 100 years.
That can't be ruled out.
Third theory...
To hell with your theories!
What can you do for us right now?
The administration will provide a daily truck with 1,300 gallons of water.
To cover your immediate daily needs.
How much water do I get for my carnations?
If our water hasn't returned in a month, what then?
We suggest you farm some land elsewhere.
What can I say?
Lots of villages have plenty of water.
No, sir... our council can't accept that!
Your council's power over natural phenomena is next to zero.
The third theory...
To hell with their theories!
We've got some administration!
And I say to hell with you!
You'll have to manage with the water truck.
It will be here in two days.
Meanwhile, gentlemen, good-bye!
Quiet!
Or else they'll send the police!
Where is he?
Where's the president of the Water Syndicate?
Who is the president?
It's not me, it's you!
I am because I'm the mayor, and that's because I have a phone!
And what is this?
- Your receipt.
- Right.
Fifty-two francs, plus the stamp.
You took my money.
Now where's my water?
Before you came, the expert explained about the orography.
You have to understand orography.
I don't give a damn!
I paid and I want my water!
Listen, they're sending a water truck every day.
Bring your mule... and you'll get 40 gallons like the rest of us.
One:
I have no mule, just a donkey.
Two: 40 gallons will do for a cafe, not for a field.
Three:
I paid for spring water, not truck water!
I'm sure they'll send spring water.
Not from my spring!
I paid and I want my water!
Stop yelling!
It's exhausting us and it won't help!
Holy Mother!
My poor eggplants.
My 600 beefsteak tomato plants!
But everyone is affected.
It's a major disaster.
Major, hell!
I paid and I want my water!
The spring stopped running.
Where should we get water?
Who cares?
Just make it run from my pipe.
And you, mind your own business!
You're a councilman, but I didn't vote for you!
- I don't need your vote.
- You pain in the ass!
Where do you think you are?
Surrounded by water thieves!
Good morning.
Today is my birthday.
After Mass you're invited for a drink.
We don't control what day we're born.
My brothers, I am truly glad... to see you all gathered in our little church.
The whole parish is here... including a group of intellectuals... who normally observe Holy Mass on the terrace of a coffee house.
I won't name it.
It's our only coffee house.
I won't name them either.
You all know them.
This ought to fill them with shame... were it not for their cynicism.
With clasped hands and moist eyes... you're full of faith and repentance today.
But God knows you're here because your spring stopped running... and your prayers are merely pleas for your string beans... orations for your tomatoes, hallelujahs for your artichokes... hosannas for your squash!
I must speak seriously about the spring.
I keep asking myself the same question.
Why is it... that this water, so plentiful until now... has suddenly dried up in the hour of our need?
I once read a Greek tragedy about the city of Thebes... that was struck by a calamitous plague... because of crimes committed by its king.
So I ask myself...
"Is there a criminal among us?"
It's not impossible... since the biggest crimes often escape human justice.
But God knows of them all!
I'll now speak to this unknown criminal, if he exists.
To him I say...
"My brother... there's no sin that cannot be forgiven... no crime that can't be atoned for... by sincere repentance"
Our Lord, Jesus Christ, said this astounding phrase:
"There is more room in heaven for one repentant sinner."
Whatever your offense, try to make amends.
Repent, and you shall be saved.
And your spring will flow better than before.
Papet.
He knows.
He looked at me three times.
What could he know?
He's only been here a year.
Maybe somebody told him in confession.
Anglade might have.
He's such a bigot that he might confess other people's sins.
What worries me is the girl.
Me too.
She seemed unfriendly to you.
She seemed to be saying, "You're the criminal."
No.
She knows nothing either.
Then what worries you?
I think she doesn't want you.
To our teacher's good health!
Here's to you!
What did you think of the sermon?
What do you expect?
It's just a lot of words.
I'm sure no act of God dried up the spring.
He seemed to allude to a crime he knew of.
Maybe he heard of it in confession and couldn't reveal more.
What crime?
If anyone here commits a crime, we'd all know.
No, I felt he had someone in mind.
- Then who?
- Yes, who?
He kept looking at Ugolin.
Yes, especially when he spoke of the plague.
- I'm a plague?
- Don't joke about such things.
You smelled our Pernod!
I came because of the water, not the Pernod.
I have to speak to you.
It's very important.
- To me?
- Yes.
You can bring our water back.
I could?
How?
By coming to the procession.
Will you?
Then our fountain won't ever flow again.
You think she's a saint?
An orphan's prayer... soars to heaven like a lark.
Our Lord will gladly listen to her song.
She's innocent.
If she prays for us, we're saved.
Manon, you must save our carnations!
I won't help those who stole my father's water!
I don't understand.
They understand!
They know why God is punishing them.
Tell us.
Do you know who the criminal is?
There are two.
There they are!
If we're treated like criminals, I'd rather go home.
Come, Galinette.
Your hurried departure might make us think...
I don't care what you think!
I think for myself.
Let's go.
- Come on!
- No.
I want to hear what she's accusing me of... because I can solve the whole problem.
Tell me how they stole your father's water.
But she's imagining things!
It's true her father's lack of water may have ruined him.
He would have found water, except for his accidental death.
The two women were in trouble... so we bought the little farmland.
Partly because we liked it, true.
But also to help them out!
Later we searched for the spring and, by sheer luck, we found it.
That's what she calls stealing his water.
"Help thy neighbor." Some joke!
Let's go!
He's lying!
The truth is the spring was always there.
The truth is you blocked it off.
Why would they do that?
To buy it cheap.
Without water, the farm is worthless.
My father's dead, thanks to these assassins!
That's not true!
That's slander!
I found that spring with my watch.
You were there with your mother.
You held a squash.
Tell the truth!
Within less than an hour?
God said to Pascal:
"You wouldn't look for me... unless you'd already found me."
To hell with Pascal!
I only met him once.
He was so rude, I slapped him!
You laugh, but it's true.
Here's what we have.
She denies what she saw and believes what she didn't see.
Who saw us block up that spring?
Who saw us block up that spring?
Me.
I saw you.
I saw you both!
Liar!
What did you see, idiot?
You never knew left from right.
In the army, they put an "X" on his left hand.
He never understood, so they sent him home.
I planned it that way.
It wasn't easy, but it worked.
The major had his suspicions.
We're not interested in that.
Tell us what you saw.
He saw nothing.
- He was dreaming.
- I never dream!
It was nine or ten years ago.
See?
He's being vague.
It was after Bouffigue died.
It was at Romarins, hunting partridge.
They were drinking from a puddle near the empty farmhouse.
I picked the lock, went upstairs...
How nice!
Breaking into a dead man's house.
Bouffigue built two small windows under the gutter to shoot thrush.
First, I took a nap.
You see, he slept!
He was dreaming!
That was no dream!
Suddenly I heard digging sounds and woke up.
I watched through the window...
This one was digging.
The other watched.
I didn't dare move.
The water gushed out of the hole... then they blocked the spring with cement.
Why didn't you tell her father?
It wasn't my business.
But now God is punishing them and us.
Now it is my business.
Suppose he's telling the truth.
It's not true, but if it were...
I'm willing to give her the spring, my carnations... the farm, the money, the Soubeyran fortune... my life.
You know it.
I told you so in the hills.
I love you more than anything.
Listen.
Listen to me, Manon.
I see you and talk to you constantly.
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.
If you don't want me, I'll die or go crazy.
Shut up, idiot.
Let's go.
Just think about it.
What a terrible mixture... between my remorse... and the happiness I'd like to bring you.
Don't you know how I'll slave for you, my love?
Make him go away!
My love!
Don't be a fool.
Get up.
Think, Manon!
Just think.
I'll die over this love, and nobody'll care.
Galinette, come on home.
No!
It's all your fault!
I lost everything because of you!
If I had known...
Galinette, my boy!
I'll stay.
Since you're all against him, I'll defend him.
That won't be easy.
You all know there never was a spring at Romarins... just a puddle.
But I found the real spring!
Those of you who are natives like me... admit that there was no spring.
Listen carefully.
If you knew of a spring and didn't tell the hunchback... then you're responsible for his death.
The old bastard!
- You knew?
- Sure.
We all knew.
We didn't dare denounce them to defend an outsider.
He hated my grandmother.
They took it out on her son.
Who's your grandmother?
Florette.
They never forgave her for marrying a man from Crespin.
Florette was your grandmother?
The hunchback was Florette's son?
Papet wants to see you and the mayor.
He wants to see you too.
- Me?
- He said to hurry.
- He said you'll be glad.
- Where is he?
At Romarins.
What's wrong?
Put him on the table.
Right there.
Go tell the deaf one... to bring some candles from the church.
At least six big ones.
And the linen sheet his grandmother wove.
Pamphile, prepare the coffin.
You have the oak boards in the attic.
The ones I wanted for myself.
I know.
You're the one who ordered them.
Use them for him.
The rest of you, please... say he fell from a tree.
Keep this a secret... for three days... or the priest won't give him a proper burial.
Now you can leave.
I'm staying with you.
There's no need to.
She should have married him... and gotten her revenge by driving him crazy.
Papet, I'm leaving because I can't go on.
It's not the carnations.
It's because of my love.
I realize she'll never want me.
I suspected it because her ribbon burned my flesh.
And when I told her in public I wanted to marry her... she spat at me in a fury.
What's more, she fled towards the teacher.
When he talks to her, she lowers her eyes.
When he stops, she lingers until he continues.
And he takes her love for granted.
He's unaware of his happiness, but I know my misery.
I can't stand it.
I'd like to kill him.
But it would hurt her, and I'd never hurt her.
I leave her my farm and all that's hidden... you know where...
to the left of the fireplace.
Don't make any trouble.
It's not her fault or yours.
It's fate.
Arrange a Mass for me, because up there...
I'll have to explain about the spring.
Adieu, my Papet.
I'm sorry to leave you, but I can't stay.
You know?
I know.
What will you do?
I don't know.
I won't go back to that house.
Too many bad memories.
I'd keep seeing him hang where my swing used to be... and smell his odor in the house.
Will you join the procession?
If you're sure... that the water won't come back, you should go.
If your father could bring back the spring... what would he do?
He'd have liked to be their friend.
For his sake, do what he would have done.
You think this procession will help?
You never know.
I wonder how I would feel if the prayers worked.
I would feel forced to go to confession.
That's what worries me.
I know several fools who'd think like you... and I'd surely lose the elections.
Miracles can be very convincing.
Something's happening!
Stop!
It's breathing.
The pipe is blowing.
A miracle!
Kneel!
On your knees!
Kneel down, everybody!
It's not a miracle!
It's just a coincidence!
I recognized your footsteps.
Your ear is as sharp as an eye.
Ears can't replace eyes, Cesar.
Belly dancing is all very well... but you made a mistake when you were over there.
I did?
I said "mistake," but it was almost a crime.
I don't know what mistake you mean.
When I was wounded, they almost promoted me.
That's something else.
I'm talking about a letter you received.
What letter?
One that deserved an answer.
An answer that you never sent.
A letter from whom?
You don't want to tell me... because you think I don't know.
- I swear, Delphine!
- Don't swear, you sinner!
I'm sorry for reminding you of something unpleasant.
What is unpleasant?
From here I see the church... and a cross on top of the steeple.
I swear on that cross that I received no letter... except from my father and Anglade.
In that case, it's a tragedy.
Why?
Swear again that you're not lying to me.
I swear it.
Who wrote to me?
Florette.
Florette Camoins?
There was no other Florette.
Are you sure?
I, myself, gave the letter to the mailman.
I'd never have forgotten a letter from her.
I still have two faded notes she wrote to me... and a black comb from her hair.
It's true.
When I came back, she had left the village.
She was married to the blacksmith in Crespin... and she already had a child.
How could that letter have gotten lost?
Over there, we moved from place to place.
Sometimes our food and even our ammunition didn't reach us.
Some letters may have been lost too.
But if I had received that letter...
I would still know it by heart.
If that's true, it's dreadful.
You think she loved me?
You old fool.
She never told me so... not even after what happened between us one night... in Anglade's barn.
That's how she was.
In her letter... she told you that she was pregnant.
What?
Yes.
You had left three weeks before.
She told you if you wrote to her father... promising to marry her... she would wait for you.
She could have shown her letter to the whole village... and nobody would have dreamed of making fun of her.
Are you sure?
The poor girl couldn't sleep.
She tried to lose the baby with devilish potions.
She jumped from high rocks in the hills... but nothing worked.
Then she started hating you.
She went to the dance at Aubagne... where she found the blacksmith from Crespin.
So she left the village... and no one ever knew when the child was born.
Was it born alive?
Alive, yes... but it was a hunchback.
I hear Clarinette coming back.
Come on over, my girl.
It's getting chilly.
I'd rather sit by the fireplace.
Adieu, Cesar.
Don't worry.
I never told anyone.
I'm going to pray for you.
What's wrong, Papet?
Are you ill?
Don't stand here.
It's too cold.
Should I call a doctor?
I could call at the Ombres.
No, thanks.
I know what's wrong with me.
Lean on me.
I'll take you home.
My friend, I don't believe you are about to die.
But I believe I am.
I know I'll die tonight.
What makes you think so?
I'll die because I no longer want to live.
Hurry and confess me.
You'll see.
I have lots to confess.
You know that suicide is a mortal sin.
I won't need to kill myself.
I'll simply pass away.
Dear God, please don't let her baby be a hunchback.
Dear little Manon... the notary will tell you that I'm leaving you my whole estate.
It may surprise you, but it's the truth.
The notary will give you all the documents.
Because your father was my son.
He was the Soubeyran I'd hoped for all my life... whom I tormented to death... because I didn't know who he was.
If I had told him about the spring... he'd still be playing his harmonica... and you'd all be living in our family home.
No one knows it, but I'm too ashamed to face anyone... even the trees.
In the village, there's a person who knows.
She will tell you everything.
It's Delphine, the old blind woman.
She'll explain that it's all because of Africa.
I don't deserve to kiss you... and I never dared speak to you.
But maybe now you can forgive me... and even say a little prayer... for poor Ugolin and me.
I'm so pathetic, I even pity myself.
Out of sheer spite, I never went near him.
I never knew his voice or his face.
I never saw his eyes... that might have been like his mother's.
I only saw his hump and the pain I caused him.
Now you understand why I want to die.
Because next to my torments... even hell would be a pleasure.
Besides, I'll see him up there.
I'm not afraid of him.
Now he knows he's a Soubeyran... and it's not my fault that he's a hunchback.
He knows it was all a foolish mistake.
I'm sure that instead of blaming me... he'll defend me.
Farewell, my darling girl.
Your grandfather, Cesar Soubeyran.

Here.
Next time I won't pay this much.
The competition from Italy is ruining me.
This barely pays for fertiliser for the flowers.
Next year we'll grow chick peas.
I'd miss our aperitifs together.
What is it?
What are you barking at?
I'm not going to steal your goats.
Leave my bread alone!
Here, we'll share my lunch.
Hold on...
leave some for me!
- Hello, chaps!
- Hello.
What did you do today, Bernard?
I went for a walk in the hills.
Look what I found.
Lignite.
The hills are full of it.
Interesting.
- I saw some goats.
- It's the hunchback's girl's herd.
The little savage!
She's been hiding from us since her father died.
I've seen her.
She's a real beauty.
She must take after her mother.
For a hunchback, he had a lovely daughter.
Who was this hunchback?
You never met him, Mr Belloiseau.
You didn't live here then.
He was a city intellectual who wanted to be a farmer.
- He was a loony!
- I'm not so sure of it.
I'm not saying he was an idiot but he just wasn't practical.
He thought he could breed rabbits by doing sums on paper.
Only because there was no water at Romarins.
But you found some.
How's the flower trade?
Christmas and Shrove Tuesday are best, and Easter's pretty good, too.
How about deaths?
Not bad at all.
They bring in a certain amount.
Come along!
Quick!
Thank you.
There's a letter for you.
My darling,
Tonight we're playing Ai'da in Bordeaux.
I've only got a small part, but I'm so pleased.
If only you were with me, I'd be almost happy.
Your loving mother.
You can't stay here for ever.
You should be with your mother.
No hares, no rabbits, no birds...
Where have they got to?
Maybe I'm going deaf and blind.
Next time I'll bring a hound along.
That one won't get away.
Galinette!
Do you know it's five o'clock?
That was some nap!
I think I must have caught the sun.
No, you're not red.
You must be short of sleep.
Come on out.
She may be deaf, but she guesses everything.
What I've got to say is just between the two of us.
Galinette, you're past thirty, and you're the last of the Soubeyrans.
I know all that...
Don't interrupt!
If I'm repeating myself, that's your fault.
I'll talk till you understand.
We Soubeyrans were the most important family of this region.
- On Grandpa's birthday...
- There were more than 30 guests.
All of them Soubeyrans, with pots of gold hidden about the place.
We were respected.
Well, things have changed.
That's fate.
No!
Fate doesn't exist.
What happened to us is the fault of our elders.
They were proud and wanted to hold on to their money.
Cousins married cousins.
One uncle married his niece.
It's just as bad for men as for rabbits.
And what was the result?
Two madwomen and three suicides.
Now, it's just us.
It's too late for me, so it's all up to you.
You're telling me to get married.
Why didn't you?
I wasn't cut out for it.
Mind you, I almost did...
It didn't work out.
I joined up on an impulse and went to Africa.
When I came back...
If she'd given me a child, I'd have married her like a shot.
But it didn't happen.
I'm like Anglade's cherry trees:
lots of flowers, but no fruit.
- So I'm to marry instead of you?
- You've got to, Galinette.
But why should I?
Why?
You ask me why!
Isn't the Soubeyran fortune reason enough?
This isn't paper money we're talking about.
It's gold!
Pots full of gold coins.
Do you understand?
I own a fortune!
The fruit of saving, skimping and hard work.
- Do you want to chuck it all away?
- Of course not!
I love gold.
If you love it, you can't deprive it of a loving owner!
Papet, I can't make a family just like that!
- I've been telling you to for years!
- Now that you're more serious,
I'd rather make up my own mind.
Have you got your eye on someone?
Maybe.
Can't you tell me who?
Look, I've been out in the sun all day and I feel a bit dazed.
I will tell you, but not yet.
Fine.
You're a good boy, Galinette.
But one thing more...
When choosing a wife, think of the children.
What do you mean?
Don't get stuck on a pretty face.
We need a girl with wide hips, long legs and big tits!
Think of her as a brood mare.
What if she's pretty besides?
If it's besides, I won't object...
On the contrary.
I'd enjoy looking at a pretty Soubeyran.
Come on!
Over here, Noe!
Come on!
We do all the work even though everyone uses the water.
Cleaning the tank twice a year won't kill you!
What with this sand, if we want clean drinking water...
Better for vegetables, too.
It's not sticky.
It looks like clay, but it's not clay.
It's bauxite powder.
A mixture of iron and aluminium.
I wonder where it's from.
The spring deposits it here after big storms, but it doesn't reach the village.
The morning after a rainy night, my spring water's the colour of rust.
It is rust: it's iron oxide.
- Then it's not harmful.
- No, it's beneficial.
Where is your spring in relation to this tank?
What do you mean?
Is it higher up or lower down?
It's hard to say.
I think the Romarins spring is higher up.
The village water must come from here and follow the same course.
- It's ten o'clock.
- I said I'd have the water on by noon!
That's two hours away.
But it takes an hour for it to reach the village.
Much though I enjoy your company, I have to see the mayor.
Don't keep him waiting!
Hey!
Someone's throwing stones!
I saw a flash of lightning!
At ten o'clock?
You must have started drinking early.
I swear I've had only a coffee!
It's my knife.
I lost it in the hills a few days ago.
- Around here?
- No.
I've never been here before.
- That's very odd.
- It's a gift from the goatherd.
- Which goatherd?
Do you mean Manon?
- Yes, the hunchback's kid.
Who else?
- Is she hiding up there?
- She'll have run away.
Too bad!
I'd like to thank her.
- Some other time!
- Thank her with a little kiss.
It's odd.
After all that talk, I dreamt about her the other night.
- In my dream, I kissed her.
- Did she let you?
In my dreams women rarely resist me.
- Aren't you eating?
- I'm not hungry.
You haven't looked well lately.
I've lost my appetite.
It's probably the poison.
What poison?
The one I spray on my carnations to kill the spiders.
- I'll do it for you.
- No.
You have to use it at night.
Sunlight does it no good.
It makes it less potent.
Daylight destroys its effectiveness.
You work at night, but don't sleep days.
You're never home.
What do you do with yourself all day long?
I go hunting and wander about the hills.
I breathe fresh air.
I need to clear my lungs of the poison.
True.
It's good for the carnations but bad for you.
You've got to eat and sleep.
- Do you want to see the doctor?
- No, I'll be all right.
See?
I'm eating.
She's going to Aubagne to sell my birds.
He's going mad!
- Who is it?
- Me!
- I know that!
Who's the woman?
- What woman?
The one you've been following to Aubagne.
I've been watching you.
And what about those birds you've been catching?
Are you going mad, or what?
Are you in love?
That's a great illness!
So who is she?
If you won't tell me, she can't be altogether nice... or else she's married.
Yes, yes, that's it!
She's married.
She's married!
- Open up, imbecile!
- No, I won't!
- We can talk through the door.
- Why?
If I can't see you, I might tell you something.
You're as mad as your poor father.
What do you want to tell me?
I don't want to, but you're insisting, so ask away!
Tell me who she is!
No, I won't!
- A city girl?
- On the contrary!
Good!
Do I know her?
- Not really.
- What do you mean?
You're bound to guess who it is.
So I know her?
See?
You know I don't want to tell you, but you insist on interrogating me.
- Well, I won't answer.
- Why not?
Because...
Because it's my secret.
My first secret love.
In that case, I'm going.
Bye!
No, stay here!
I want to talk about her.
- I don't even know who she is.
- But I do!
Papet, are you going?
No, I'm rolling a cigarette.
So, you want to marry her?
Yes, but she won't have me.
- Why not?
- She's pretty and I'm ugly.
Has she got money?
Not much.
Is she healthy?
Yes, she's as strong as a horse.
She's got good muscles.
She could do a good job on my carnations.
- And she's educated.
- How do you know?
She reads books for hours at a time.
That sounds bad.
I'm wary of a poor girl who reads books.
Besides, a beautiful wife may be fickle.
Is she virtuous?
Wild and pure as the driven snow.
She'd be a wonderful wife.
I'd be happy as a king but she wouldn't want me.
No poor girl would reject a Soubeyran... unless she's mad.
If she said yes, would you consent?
I can't until I know who she is.
Come on, you fool!
Open up and tell me!
No!
I can't open the door!
I've got to think.
- Papet...
- Yes?
I'll tell you, but you must swear on the family name that when you hear her name you won't say a word.
- As you like.
- No!
Swear to me!
I swear on the name of the Soubeyrans.
Good.
Now I've got to decide.
I'm not opening the door;
I'm just taking out the key.
Put your ear next to the keyhole.
It's Manon, the hunchback's daughter.
In 20 years' time, she'll think you too old for her and she might be unfaithful.
Not a girl like her.
She's just like the rest of them.
But never mind.
By then you'll have your family of sturdy Soubeyrans.
She's lovely.
You have my consent.
- Have you seen her?
- Yes, I have.
- What do you think?
- I told you.
She's lovely.
She seems mature for her age.
She looks at least 18.
- Do you know who she looks like?
- Nobody.
Yes, she does.
She looks like someone you never knew.
- Her grandmother.
- Did you know her?
Florette Camoins.
The great beauty.
I'm glad to meet you at last.
I wanted to thank you for my knife.
- How did you know it was mine?
- I saw you eating with it the other day.
I'm the new teacher.
I'm making a collection of local rocks so I can teach my pupils about their land.
I thought you were a gold-digger.
It's all cretaceous, from the Quaternary era.
You know a lot for a country girl.
My father taught me.
- I'd like you to keep this.
- I've got one.
- That one's too fancy for me.
- It's not!
Why shouldn't a goatherd have a good knife?
It's got four blades and a nail file.
And some scissors.
I know.
I used them.
It's the first one I've trapped.
It's a baby.
The hawks eat the big ones.
That hare's my offering to you.
My class begins soon.
I've got to go.
I'll leave this on a rock.
Someone will be glad to find it.
She doesn't want your knife.
- I'll keep it if you take the hare.
- Fine.
Thanks.
- Papet...
- Yes.
What's the best way to talk to girls?
I don't know how to talk about love.
So, you've made up your mind?
Yes.
I'd better hurry because she often goes to Aubagne and she might meet a man who'll take her from me.
- Where will you talk to her?
- In the hills.
I'll pretend I'm gathering snails and didn't see her.
Hang on!
If you do that, it'll look as if you're poor.
Show your wealth!
Don't wear your old clothes.
You should wear a new suit, a hunting outfit with leather leggings and a hat to match.
And most important of all...
Wear braces!
Excuse me...
I'm looking for a hare I shot which must be wounded.
Aren't you Manon, the daughter of poor Monsieur Jean?
I see you don't remember me.
That's because I've changed a lot.
I'm Ugolin, your poor father's friend.
You've changed, too.
You're a proper little lady.
I barely recognised you.
Perhaps you're wondering why we haven't met before.
I don't have time to hunt any more because of my carnations.
Did you know I grew carnations?
I've been very successful.
I've made lots of money.
The money's all in gold coins!
With my savings, I'll be worth 50,000 francs in two years.
Would you like to move back to Romarins?
I could stay in my house in Massacan and you could tend to my flowers.
Manon, listen to me!
I know why you don't want to.
It's because you're proud.
But your pride's no problem.
Carnations must be watered and picked.
A woman will do that well.
I'll pay you.
You'll be well paid.
It's not to give you work.
I was lying.
It's because I love you.
I love you with all my heart!
Manon!
I want to marry you!
I'm all alone!
I've got no-one!
My grandparents are dead.
My father hanged himself when I was little.
My mother died of the flu.
There's only Uncle Papet!
He's rich, he's old.
He's going to die.
He's going to leave me all his money.
It'll be yours, because I love you!
I love you!
I am sick for the love of you.
It's suffocating me!
I saw you bathing in the rainwater.
I watched for hours.
You were so lovely.
I was tempted to commit a crime.
- Did you talk to her?
- I didn't see her.
- She must have gone to Aubagne.
- Then do it tomorrow.
Maybe.
I have to get used to this outfit.
You look great!
Like a hunter from Marseilles.
- Look!
See that?
- A nice little thrush.
- That girl must have trapped it.
- Really?
Yes.
See?
There's her herd.
She can't be far off.
I always respect other people's traps.
And it's this poor girl's only livelihood.
I've seen her selling birds in Aubagne.
- We've done her enough harm already.
- Not on purpose.
It wasn't our fault.
It was.
We all knew there was a spring at Romarins but no-one said anything.
- So why didn't you tell him?
- Because of Amelie.
- Shall we eat?
- Let's.
I used to go hunting over there and see that poor hunchback dowsing for water.
Once, he was right above it but the rod didn't move.
Later, I saw him digging in the wrong place and it kept on bothering me.
I told Amelie and she flew into such a rage.
It was none of our business.
Hunchbacks are bad luck.
He was an outsider, from Crespin, etc, etc.
You know what she's like.
She made me swear to say nothing.
- So you didn't?
- No.
- Ugolin and Papet were real bastards.
- On that score, we were all bastards.
- Papet, my spring's dried up!
- What?
- No water.
- None at all?
No.
I dug a deep hole.
Not a drop.
- My carnations are budding.
- 1 5,000 of them.
- There's your tank.
- In two days, it'll be empty.
Springs are capricious.
I bet it'll flow again in three months.
Three months!
Oh, Lord!
Stop it, you fool!
Get up!
It's probably already flowing again.
If not, we can transport enough water using a few mules.
It used to flow.
When the hunchback came, it stopped...
Hey!
There's something wrong with the fountain.
- Come and see.
- Impossible!
- Not here, too?
We're ruined!
- Calm down!
Well?
There must be a frog blocking the pipe.
We're stuck, like Ugolin.
Impossible!
It's flowed for 50 years.
Let's check the tank.
Nothing.
- Right.
I'm off.
- Don't worry.
Monsieur Jean, you're a good man and you're up in heaven.
You can see that my feet are so swollen I can hardly walk, that my mule's half dead.
If this continues, my carnations will be ruined.
Please, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, give us back your daughter's spring.
Amen.
Help us!
Amen, damn it!
Hello?
Yes, I'm the mayor.
How soon can he get here?
Tomorrow?
We'll be dead by then!
We need him now.
We've got no bread.
Our crops are ruined.
It's a catastrophe.
Then I'll expect him at seven at the public hall.
Thank you.
- The expert will be here tomorrow.
- What expert?
The Rural Engineering expert I've been asking for.
I declare the meeting open.
We're meeting to discuss the problem of water.
- It's not a problem: it's a disaster!
- Quite right.
But thanks to my personal initiative and my phone, the local authority has sent us expert help.
This is the expert.
Gentlemen, I've studied your problem, and this is what I shall report to the Chief Engineer.
The Perdrix spring which supplied your fountain is the main source of water for this whole region.
It runs between two layers of limestone.
The spring is not diaclistic, but a Vauclusian resurgence.
Let's not forget that, eh?
Thus, the water flowed between two impervious strata, pressing against the upper layer.
The pressure generated forced water into the tank.
Gravity then ensured the flow of water from the tank to the village.
Right.
Gravity.
At the request of your mayor and with local authority permission, we have examined the cause of the present obstruction.
First, where is the source of the water?
I have here a useful document...
It's an analysis by the Chief Engineer clearly stating the results of experiments made in the region some five years ago.
Sadly, there's no indication whatever of a spring in this area.
There's no stream within the orography of the Huveaune river.
What does that mean?
The source of your water is some way away.
- I want to speak.
- This isn't the time.
I'll make it short.
Just let him turn on the water.
He can explain later.
I'm not a plumber.
Now, the first hypothesis is drought.
The trouble may be due to a drop in the water table.
The watercourse is determined by seams of dolomite in the limestone.
It can cross the seams via a network of siphons.
You know what that is?
You use them in winemaking.
Precisely.
During the rainy season, the siphons are reactivated as soon as the water table rises to its normal level.
What table?
Quiet!
To oppose progress is a sure sign of ignorance!
If progress turns my water on, I'm all for it, and, if my spring flows again, here's my 100 francs for progress.
Let's hear the rest... the rest of his rubbish.
Now, the second hypothesis.
The subterranean stream drops into a network of cavities.
Once they're full, the water rises and the spring will flow again.
- How soon?
- I really couldn't say.
Perhaps in two days, perhaps in two years.
Or a hundred years!
That's not to be ruled out.
Third hypothesis...
To hell with your theories!
What can you do for us right now?
The administration can provide a daily truck with 1 ,300 gallons of water.
That should cover your daily needs.
How much do I get for my flowers?
If we've got no water by next month, what'll you do?
We'd suggest you farm the land elsewhere.
There's no lack of villages where water is plentiful.
Our council can never accept that!
Your council's influence on natural phenomena is next to zero.
- The third hypothesis...
- To hell with their hypo-thingies!
The administration's just a waste of time!
In that case, the administration says you can go to hell!
The water truck will be here in two days.
Meanwhile, gentlemen, I wish you good luck.
Where is he?
Where's the head of the Water Board?
I'm not the head of the Water Board:
you are!
Only because I'm the mayor and I've got a phone.
- See this?
What's this?
- It's your receipt.
Right. 52 francs plus the stamp.
So, where's the water I paid for?
The expert explained it's the orography.
That's the whole problem.
I don't give a damn!
I paid for my water and I want it.
Listen...
They'll send a lorry of water daily.
Just bring your mule and you'll get 40 gallons of water like the rest of us.
One:
I haven't got a mule, only a donkey.
Two: 40 gallons are enough for a cafe but not my field.
Three:
I paid for spring water, not truck water.
- The truck water must be spring water.
- Not from my spring!
I want my water.
Stop yelling.
You're driving us mad.
What about my aubergines?
And my tomatoes are just ripening.
It's the same for everyone.
Damn that!
I've paid and I want my water.
The spring's dry.
How can we get water?
I don't care, as long as I get mine back.
And you - mind your own business!
You may be a councillor but I didn't vote for you.
Who cares about your vote?
- Why us?
Who do you think we are?
- Water thieves!
Stop!
Stop it!
Good morning.
Today's my birthday and I'd like to invite you over for a drink after Mass.
I had no say over my birth date.
Dearly beloved, I am truly happy to see you all gathered in our little church.
The whole parish is here, including some clever folks - too clever, perhaps - who generally ignore Mass and hang around in the cafe.
I won't name it - it's our only cafe - or name them, since everyone's staring at them already.
I hope this shames them, rather than making them laugh.
Your hands are joined, your eyes moist.
Today you are all steeped in faith.
But God knows that your piety is due to your spring and that your prayers are merely pleas for your beans, orisons for your tomatoes, hallelujahs for your potatoes, and hosannas for your marrows!
Now, I must speak seriously about the spring.
I keep asking myself the question:
Why has this water, once so plentiful, suddenly dried up in our hour of need?
I once read in a Greek tragedy, a profane work of literature, that Thebes was struck by a calamitous plague because its king had committed some crimes.
And so I ask myself:
Is there a criminal among us?
It's quite possible, since many wicked crimes escape the justice of men, but the Good Lord knows all about them!
So, if this criminal does exist, let me now appeal to him.
Let me say to him:
My brother, there's no sin that cannot be forgiven, no crime that can't be atoned for by the most sincere repentance.
According to Jesus Christ himself, there will always be room in heaven for a repentant sinner.
So, whatever your offence, try to redeem yourself.
Repent and you shall be saved!
And our spring will flow again as before.
- Papet!
- Yes?
He meant us.
He looked at me three times.
What could he know?
He's only been here for a year.
Maybe somebody told him in confession.
It's possible Anglade did it.
He's so self-righteous that he's liable to confess other people's sins.
- I'm worried about the girl.
- So am I.
She seemed hostile to you.
She looked at me twice, as if to say "You're the criminal".
- No, she knows nothing.
- Then why are you worried?
I don't think she wants you.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
Here's to our teacher's good health.
Here's to you!
- What did you think of that sermon?
- Nothing.
It's just a lot of talk.
I can't believe the spring dried up through an act of God.
He implied it was a criminal act.
He probably learnt about it through someone's confession.
What crime?
If someone here was guilty, we'd all know about it.
I'm sure he had someone in mind.
- Who?
- Yes, who?
- He looked at Ugolin a lot.
- Especially when he mentioned plague.
- I haven't got the plague!
- You shouldn't joke about such things.
- You smelled the Pernod!
- No, I came on account of the water.
- I've got something important to say.
- To me?
Yes.
You can bring our water back.
How can l?
By coming to the procession.
Will you?
If you refuse, our fountain will never flow again.
She's not a saint!
An orphan's prayer soars heavenwards like a lark.
Our Lord will listen to her.
She's innocent.
If she prays for us, we're saved.
Manon, you must come and save our flowers!
I won't pray for people who robbed my father.
I don't understand you.
They do.
They know why God is punishing them.
Do you know who the criminal is?
There are two of them.
Them.
I've had enough of this nonsense.
I'm going home.
Come on, Galinette.
- Your reaction might arouse suspicion...
- I don't care what you suspect.
My conscience is clear.
Let's go home!
- Come on!
- No.
I want to hear what she's got against me.
I can settle the whole matter.
- How did they steal your father's water?
- She's imagining things.
It's true that her father's lack of water ruined him.
But for his fatal accident, he might have found it.
Since the two women were in trouble, we bought the farmstead...
Partly because we liked it - that's true - but partly, too, to help them out.
Later on, purely by chance, we found the spring.
She calls that stealing her water.
Help thy neighbour - some joke!
Let's go.
It's not true!
He's lying!
He knew that spring was on our land.
What really happened is that you deliberately blocked it up.
- Why would they do that?
- To buy it cheap.
The dry land was worthless.
- Those two murdered my father!
- That's not true!
It's slander!
I found that spring with my watch.
You and your mother saw me looking for it.
- Tell the truth!
- In less than one hour?
God said to Pascal:
"You wouldn't look for me unless you'd already found me."
To hell with Pascal!
I only met him once.
He was so rude I slapped him.
You laugh, but it's true!
She denies what she saw, but she believes what she didn't see.
Who saw us block that spring?
You see!
Who saw us block it up?
I saw you.
Both of you.
Liar!
What did you see?
You don't know left from right!
In the army, he failed every test.
He was so stupid they sent him home.
That was exactly what I wanted.
It wasn't easy, but I got away with it...
Never mind that.
Tell us what you saw.
He saw nothing.
He dreamt it.
I never dream.
It was nine or ten years ago.
- See how vague he is?
- Just after Bouffigue died.
I was hunting at Romarins.
The partridges were drinking from a puddle near the empty farm, so I went inside.
Charming behaviour!
Stealing from a dead man's house!
It was so I could shoot the partridges from an upstairs window.
- First, I snoozed for a while.
- I knew it: he was dreaming.
I wasn't dreaming!
Suddenly, there was the sound of digging and it woke me up.
I saw them from the window - one digging and the other looking on.
I didn't dare move.
I saw the water gush out and then I saw them block the spring.
Why didn't you tell her father?
It was none of my business, but now we're all being punished it is my business.
Suppose that what he's said is true...
It's not, but let's just suppose it is...
You know I'd give her everything:
the spring, my flowers, my house, my money, the Soubeyran fortune and my life.
You know that.
I told you so in the hills.
I love you unbearably.
Listen...
Please listen, Manon.
Ever since I saw you, ever since I spoke to you, food has been turning to sawdust in my mouth, sleep's been a torment...
If you reject me, I'll die or go mad.
Shut up, you fool.
Let's go.
Just think how I feel.
I'm all mixed up, what with remorse for the harm I've done you and the happiness I want to offer you.
You must know how I'd slave for you!
- Oh, my love!
- Make him go away!
Don't be a fool!
Stand up!
Manon, you must realise, I'm going to die for the love of you, and no-one cares!
Galinette, come home!
No!
It's all your fault!
I've lost everything because of you.
If only I'd known.
Galinette, my boy!
I'm staying.
Since you're all against him, I'll defend him.
I don't see how you can.
You all know there was no spring at Romarins - just a puddle.
But I found the real spring.
You men, you're natives like me:
tell him there was no spring.
Listen: anyone who knew there was one and didn't tell the hunchback is responsible for his death.
- The old bastard!
- You knew!
Of course.
We all knew.
But we didn't dare denounce them to protect an outsider.
They hated my grandmother and wanted revenge.
Who's your grandmother?
Florette.
It's because she married a man from Crespin.
Florette was your grandmother?
Then the hunchback was Florette's son?
Papet says he wants to see you and the mayor.
- Papet wants to see you both.
- Me?
He said to come quickly.
- Where is he?
- At Romarins, waiting for you.
What can Cesar want?
Put him on the table.
Put him here.
Go to the village and tell the woman to bring some candles from the church.
At least six big ones...
And the linen sheet his grandmother wove...
Pamphile, prepare the coffin.
You've got those oak boards in the attic... the ones I wanted for myself.
The ones you asked me to order.
Use them for him.
Can I ask you all to say he fell from a tree.
Keep the suicide secret until after the funeral.
Otherwise the priest won't want to bury him properly.
Now you can all go.
- I'll stay with you.
- There's no need to.
She should have married him anyhow and avenged herself by making his life hell on earth.
Papet, I can't go on living.
I don't care about the carnations;
it's because of my love.
She'll never love me.
I suspected so because I've got an infection from her ribbon.
And when I told her I wanted to marry her, she spat at me in a fury.
Besides, she prefers the teacher.
When he talks to her, she lowers her eyes.
When he stops, she's eager for him to start again.
He doesn't even think about it, but takes it for granted.
He's a happy man, and I'm miserable.
I can't bear it any longer.
I'd like to kill him, but that would grieve her, so I won't deprive her of him.
I'm giving her my farm and what's hidden next to the fireplace.
You know where.
Don't make any trouble.
It's not her fault or yours: it's just fate.
Arrange a Mass for me.
I'll have to account for the spring up there.
Adieu, Papet.
I'm sorry to leave you, but I can't go on living.
Do you know?
Yes.
What will you do?
I don't know.
I won't go back to that house.
Too many bad memories.
I'd always think of his body on the tree... and his smell in the house.
Will you join the procession?
If you're absolutely sure the water won't come back, you should go.
If your father could have brought back their spring, what would he have done?
I think he'd have wanted their friendship.
If that's so, you must do likewise.
- Do you think the procession will help?
- You never know.
We'll see if the fountain responds to our prayers.
If it does, I'll have to go to confession.
That's the trouble:
if the water comes back, every fool might feel like you and I'll end up losing the election.
Miracles are very convincing.
Something's happening...
Stop!
It's gurgling!
There's a gurgling in the pipe.
A miracle!
On your knees!
On your knees, everybody!
It's not a miracle!
It's just a coincidence.
I recognised your footsteps.
Your ears are sharp.
My hearing can't replace my eyesight, Cesar.
Belly dancing's all very well, but you made a mistake in going to North Africa.
I did?
I say mistake, but it was almost a crime.
What mistake do you mean?
When I was wounded, I was about to be promoted.
That's not what I meant.
I'm talking about the letter you received.
- What letter?
- One that deserved an answer... but you failed to respond.
A letter from whom?
You don't want to talk to me about it because you think I don't know.
- I swear, Delphine.
- Don't swear, you sinner!
I'm sorry to be stirring up a bitter memory.
A bitter memory?
Delphine, we're beside the church, in the presence of the cross.
I swear by that cross that I received no letter except from my father, Anglade and Castagne.
If that's the truth, it's tragic.
Why?
Swear again that you're not lying to me.
I swear it.
Who wrote to me?
Florette.
Florette Camoins?
There was no other Florette.
Are you sure?
I gave the letter to the postman.
I'd never have forgotten a letter from her.
I still have two faded notes she wrote me... and one of her combs.
That's it.
When I came back, she'd left the village.
She'd married that blacksmith from Crespin.
She already had a child.
Is it possible her letter didn't reach you?
Over there we kept on moving around.
Sometimes we didn't get food or even ammunition.
It's definitely possible that letters got lost as well.
But if there'd been one from her
I'd know it by heart.
If that's true, it's dreadful!
- Do you think she loved me?
- You old fool!
She never admitted it... not even after what we did one night in Anglade's barn.
That's just the way she was.
But in her letter she wrote that she was pregnant.
- What?
- Yes.
You'd been gone three weeks.
She said that if you wrote to promise her father to marry her, she'd wait for you.
She'd have shown your letter to everybody so that no-one would laugh at her.
Are you sure?
The poor girl couldn't sleep.
She tried to get rid of the baby with magic potions.
She jumped from high rocks in the hills, but nothing worked.
She came to hate you.
She went to Aubagne, where she met that blacksmith from Crespin.
So she left the village and no-one ever knew when the child was born.
Was it alive?
Yes, alive.
But a hunchback.
I hear Clairette coming for me.
Come on over, girl.
It's getting chilly.
I want to sit by the fireside.
Adieu, Cesar.
Don't worry.
I've never told anyone.
I'll pray for you.
- What's wrong, Papet?
Are you ill?
- No, no.
Don't stay out here.
Come inside.
- Shall I call a doctor?
- No.
- I could call through to Ombrees.
- No.
I know what's wrong with me.
Lean on me.
I'll take you home.
My friend, I don't believe you're near death.
I believe I am.
I know I'm going to die tonight.
Why do you think so?
I'll die because I don't want to live.
Let's get on with the confession.
You can see I need to confess.
Remember, suicide is a cardinal sin.
I've no need to kill myself.
I'll simply let myself go.
Please God, don't let her baby be a hunchback.
Dear little Manon,
I am leaving you my whole estate.
You may wonder why, but it's the truth.
The solicitor will give you all the documents.
It's because your father was my son, the Soubeyran I'd hoped for all my life.
I tormented him to death because I didn't know who he was.
If I'd told him about the spring, he'd still be playing his harmonica and you'd all be living in our family home.
No-one knows about it, but even so, I'm bitterly ashamed.
In the village, there's one person who'll tell you the truth.
It's Delphine, the old blind woman.
She'll explain how it's all because of Africa.
I don't deserve to kiss you and I never dared to speak to you, but maybe now you can forgive me and even pray for poor Ugolin and me.
Even I find myself a pitiable being.
I think it was because of spite that I never went near him.
I never heard his voice or saw his face or his eyes, which might have been like his mother's.
All I saw was his hump and the grief I caused him.
You'll understand why I want to die.
I'm so hounded by my miserable thoughts that even hell will be a blessed release.
I'm not afraid to see him up there, now he knows he's a Soubeyran and it's not my fault he's a hunchback.
He realises it was all a foolish mistake.
I'm sure he won't resent me, but will even defend me.
Farewell, my darling girl.
Your grandfather, Cesar Soubeyran.
Next time I won't pay this much.
The competition from Italy is killing me.
This barely pays for the fertilizer.
Next year we'll grow chick-peas.
I'll miss having drinks with friends like you.
What's all this barking about?
I won't steal your herd.
Move over.
Leave me my bread!
Here, we'll share my lunch.
Well, now what will I eat?
Go on, move.
Bernard, what did you do today?
I explored the hill.
Look what I found.
Lignites.
This area is full of them.
Very interesting.
And I saw some unattended goats.
Must be the hunchback's daughter's herd.
I haven't seen the little savage since her dad died.
She hides from us.
I've seen her.
She's beautiful.
Her mother was a real beauty.
That hunchback hatched a lovely daughter.
Who was he?
You didn't know him.
It was before you moved here.
He was a city intellectual who played at being a farmer.
He was a nut.
He wasn't all that nutty.
I didn't say he was an idiot.
He just wasn't practical.
He tried breeding rabbits by multiplying numbers on paper.
Why?
Because he had no water.
But you found some.
Your carnations are doing well.
On holidays, mostly Christmas and Mardi Gras.
Easter is good too.
And the dead.
Aren't they good business?
Not bad.
Funerals bring good income.
Let's go.
Hurry up!
Thanks.
Here's a letter.
My darling...
Tonight we're doing Aida in Bordeaux.
I sing a small role, but I'm thrilled.
If only you were with me, I'd be truly happy.
Your loving mother.
You can't stay here forever.
You should go join your mother.
No hare or rabbit or partridge in sight.
Maybe I'm going deaf and blind.
Next time I'll bring the butcher's dog.
That hare won't get away!
Galinette!
Do you know it's five o'clock?
That's some nap.
I think I got sunstroke.
No, you're not red.
You must be needing sleep.
Come outside.
She can't hear, but she guesses everything.
What I'll say to you concerns only us two.
Galinette...
You're past 30, and you're the last of the Soubeyrans.
I know all that.
Don't interrupt!
If I keep saying it, it's your fault.
I'll say it until you understand.
We Soubeyrans were this region's most important family.
On Grandpa's birthday...
There were 30 of you.
All Soubeyrans, with cans of gold hidden throughout the house.
Everyone respected us.
It didn't last, but don't blame me.
That's fate.
There's no such thing as fate.
Good-for-nothings always blame fate!
It was the fault of our elders.
Because of pride and greed, they married among themselves.
Cousins married cousins.
An uncle married his niece.
That's bad for rabbits, and not good for people.
What's the result?
Two madwomen and three suicides.
Now there's only us two.
I don't count anymore.
So you're what's left of the Soubeyrans.
You want me to marry.
Why didn't you take a wife?
I wasn't cut out for it.
Mind you, I almost did... but it didn't work out.
I joined the army in Africa, on a whim... and when I came back...
If there had been a child, I'd gladly have married her.
But it didn't happen.
I'm like Anglade's cherry tree.
Many blossoms, but never any fruit.
So I should marry instead of you.
You have to, Galinette.
But why?
Why?
You're asking me why?
What about the Soubeyran fortune?
It's not banknotes that rats eat.
It's gold!
Cans full of gold coins.
Understand?
And I own them!
That's from savings, skimping and hard work.
You'd throw it all out?
Of course not.
I love gold.
Then don't leave it without an owner.
You can't ask me to start a family just like that.
I've asked you for ten years.
But not as seriously as today.
Besides, I have my own ideas.
You have someone in mind?
Maybe.
Won't you tell me who?
Listen, I was in the sun all day.
I feel woozy.
I'll tell you, but be patient.
Fine.
I like you, Galinette.
Just one more thing.
In choosing a wife, think of the children.
What do you mean?
Don't be enticed by a pretty face.
What we need is wide hips, long legs... and nice, big tits.
It's like choosing a brood mare.
What if she's also pretty?
If it's also, I won't mind.
On the contrary... she'd be the Soubeyran beauty.
I'd enjoy looking at her.
Over here, Noe!
Come!
Why is it always my turn?
The water is for everyone.
Cleaning the basin twice a year won't kill you.
This red sand and the dead leaves.
People need clean water.
So do vegetables.
This is strange.
Looks like clay, but it's not.
No... it's bauxite powder.
A mixture of iron and aluminum.
Where does it come from?
From the spring, after big storms.
It settles here... and never reaches the fountain.
After a rainy night... my spring water turns red and the stones look rusty.
It is rust, since it's iron oxide.
Then it can't hurt.
No.
It's actually good.
Where's your spring in relation to this basin?
What do you mean?
Is it higher up or below?
That's hard to say.
The Romarins valley is above here.
Then the village water comes from the same valley.
It's ten o'clock.
I promised they'd have water by noon!
That's two hours away.
But it takes an hour before it reaches the village.
I enjoy your company, but I must report to the mayor.
Don't keep him waiting, teacher.
Someone's throwing stones!
Wasn't that lightning?
You saw lightning?
You must have started drinking real early.
I swear I drank only coffee this morning.
That's my knife.
I lost it a few days ago.
- Around here?
- No.
I haven't been here before.
That's strange.
The shepherdess returned it to you.
- Where is she?
- What shepherdess?
- You mean Manon?
- The hunchback's Manon.
Who else?
Is she hiding here?
No, she ran away.
Too bad.
I wanted to thank her.
Some other time.
Thank her with a little kiss.
I don't know her, but I dreamt about her.
In my dream, I even kissed her.
Did she let you?
In my dreams, women don't resist me.
Aren't you eating?
I'm not hungry.
You haven't looked well lately.
I've lost my appetite.
Probably from that poison.
What poison?
The one I spray on my carnations... to kill the red spiders.
I'll do it for you.
No.
It has to be done at night.
Daylight is no good for it.
It weakens it.
It kills its effectiveness.
You work nights, but you don't sleep days.
You're never home.
What do you do all day?
I hunt.
I walk around on the hill.
I breathe in the fresh air... to clean out my lungs...
- from that poison.
- That's true.
It's good for the carnations, but bad for you.
Still, you should eat and sleep.
Want a doctor?
No.
I'll be all right.
See?
I'm eating.
She's going to Aubagne to sell my birds.
He's nuts.
Who is it?
It's me!
Yes, you're going crazy.
- Who is the woman?
- What woman?
The one you visit in Aubagne.
I've watched you for days.
You keep collecting birds.
What for?
I see you prancing and talking to yourself as if you're crazy!
Are you in love?
That's a good sickness.
Who is she?
You won't tell me.
Then she's either a tramp... or she's married.
That's it!
She's married!
She's married!
Open up!
No, I won't!
- We can talk through the door.
- Why?
If I don't see you, I might tell you.
You're as dopey as your poor mother.
Now, tell me.
I don't want to tell you anything.
Ask me questions.
Tell me who she is.
I won't tell you that.
A city girl?
Quite the opposite.
Even better.
Do I know her?
Actually, no.
What does that mean?
You're too clever.
After four questions, you'll know.
- Then...
I do know her.
- See?
I don't want to tell you.
You act like a cop, but I won't tell you.
Why not?
Because!
It's my secret.
My first love secret, and I'm keeping it.
Keep it.
I'm leaving.
Good-bye.
No!
Stay!
I want to talk about her.
I don't even know who she is.
But I do, so I like talking about her.
Papet, did you leave?
No.
I'm rolling a cigarette.
So, you want to marry her?
Yes, but she won't want me.
- Why?
- She's pretty and I'm ugly.
Does she have money?
Not much.
- Is she healthy?
- Yes.
She's strong as a horse and has good little muscles.
She would do a better job on my carnations than me.
And she's educated too.
How do you know?
She's always reading books.
Sometimes for a whole hour.
That's no good.
A poor girl who reads books.
I don't like it.
Besides, a beautiful wife could mean trouble.
Is she honest?
She's the Holy Virgin of the hills.
If she'd marry me, I'd be happy as a king.
But she won't.
No poor girl ever rejected a Soubeyran.
Unless she's crazy.
If she said yes, would you consent?
I can't say until I know who she is.
You idiot!
Open up and tell me!
I won't open the door!
I have to think!
Papet...
I may tell you, but first, swear by all the Soubeyrans... that when you hear her name, you won't say a word.
- As you like.
- No!
Swear it!
I swear it by all the Soubeyrans.
Good!
Now I have to decide.
I won't open the door.
I'll take out the key.
Put your ear next to the keyhole.
It's Manon, the hunchback's daughter.
Twenty years from now, you'll be too old for her.
- She'll have lovers.
- She wouldn't do that.
She's like all the others.
But never mind.
By then you'll have a house full of sturdy little Soubeyrans.
Since she's pretty, I give my consent.
You've seen her?
Yes, I have.
What's your opinion?
She's very pretty.
She seems mature for her age.
She must be 18 by now.
Know who she's like?
Nobody.
She looks like someone you never knew.
She looks exactly like her grandmother.
You knew her grandmother?
Florette Camoins... the beauty!
Miss, I'm glad to meet you... to thank you for my knife.
How did you know it was mine?
I saw you eating with it one day.
I'm the new teacher.
I'm collecting minerals in the hills... to teach my pupils the composition of their land.
There's no gold here.
It's Jurassic cretaceous from the second Quaternary era.
You're well-informed for a shepherdess.
I'm just quoting my dad.
I'd like you to keep this.
I've got one.
That one's too fancy for me.
No.
A shepherdess should have a shepherd's knife.
It has four blades, an awl and a nail file.
And small scissors.
I know, because I used them.
It's the first one I snared.
It's a baby.
The big ones get away.
That hare is my present to you.
My class starts soon.
I have to leave.
I'll leave this on a rock.
Someone is bound to find it.
She doesn't want your knife.
I'll keep it if you take the hare.
All right.
Thanks.
Papet...
How does one talk to girls?
I don't know any words of love.
So you've made up your mind?
Yes, I must hurry.
She could meet a man in Aubagne who might take her from me.
Where will you court her?
In the hills.
I'll pretend to look for mushrooms or snails... as if I didn't see her.
Not so fast.
If you're looking for mushrooms or snails... it makes you seem poor.
If you're rich, show it.
Don't wear your old clothes.
Wear a new suit, a real hunting outfit... with leather leggins and a matching hat.
And above all... wear suspenders.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a hare I shot that must be wounded.
Aren't you Manon, the daughter of Monsieur Jean?
I see you don't remember me.
That's because I've changed a lot.
I'm Ugolin... your poor father's friend.
You've changed too.
You're a real young lady.
I hardly recognize you.
You may wonder why we never met before.
I'm too busy to hunt because of my carnations.
Did you know I grow carnations?
I've been very successful.
I've earned lots of money.
The money's all in gold coins!
In two years, with my savings, I'll be worth 50,000 francs.
Would you like to move back to Romarins?
I'd stay in my Massacan house... and you and Baptistina can tend my carnations.
Manon, listen to me!
I know why you don't want to!
It's because you're proud.
But your pride is no problem.
Carnations need watering, picking, and women know all about that.
I'll pay you!
I'll pay you very well!
It isn't to have you work.
I was lying.
It's because I love you.
I love you with all my heart.
Manon!
I want to marry you!
I'm all alone.
I have no one!
My grandparents are dead!
My father hanged himself.
My mother died of the flu!
There's only Uncle Papet!
He's rich.
He's old!
He's going to die!
He'll leave it all to me, and it'll be yours!
Because I love you!
I love you!
My love for you is choking me... making me ill.
I saw you bathing in the water holes.
I watched for hours, you were so beautiful.
I was afraid I'd commit a crime!
- You spoke to her?
- I didn't see her.
She must have gone to Aubagne.
Then do it tomorrow.
Maybe.
First I've got to get used to this outfit.
You look great!
Like a hunter from Marseilles.
Look!
Do you see what I see?
A beautiful thrush.
That trap must belong to the hunchback's daughter.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
That is her herd.
She must be around here.
I won't touch it.
Other people's traps are sacred.
Especially hers.
That's her only livelihood.
She sells them at the Aubagne market.
She's proud.
We've already hurt her enough.
We didn't mean to.
We're not responsible.
We're all responsible.
We knew there was a spring at Romarins, but we said nothing.
Why didn't you speak up?
Because of Amelie.
- You want a bite?
- I sure do.
When I used to hunt at Romarins, I'd see... that poor hunchback look for water with his rod.
Once he was right above it, but the rod didn't bend.
Then he dug in the wrong spot.
That night I was upset... so I told Amelie.
What a scene!
She flew into a rage!
It was none of our business...
hunchbacks are bad luck... he was an outsider from Crespin, etc., etc.
You know how she is.
She made me swear to say nothing.
- So you didn't?
- No.
Ugolin and Papet are real bastards.
In that whole business, we were all bastards.
Papet!
My spring stopped running!
- What?
- No water!
None at all!
I dug down deep.
Not a drop!
Now what?
The carnations are budding!
- 15,000 of them.
- The well!
The well will be empty in two days.
Springs are capricious, especially yours.
- Give it three months.
- Three months!
Holy Mother!
Stop it, you fool!
The water is probably back by now.
And if not, with a few mules, we can hold out.
Let's take a look.
It used to flow.
When the hunchback came, it stopped.
Listen!
Something's wrong with our fountain.
It's just trickling.
Come and see!
That's not possible.
Here too!
Papet, we're ruined!
Calm down!
You see?
Could be a frog or a snake inside.
We're stuck, like Ugolin.
Impossible!
It hasn't stopped running in 50 years.
I'll go check out the basin.
Nothing!
I'm on my way.
Don't worry!
Monsieur Jean, have mercy.
You're up in heaven, so you can see... that my feet are so swollen that I can't wear shoes... that my mule is half-dead.
If this goes on, my carnations are ruined in eight days.
Come on.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost... give us back your daughter's spring.
Amen.
Help us!
Amen, damn it!
Yes, I'm the mayor.
When will you get here?
Tomorrow?
We'll all be dead!
He must come right away!
We have no bread.
Our crops are ruined.
It's a disaster!
Then I'll expect him tomorrow at the town hall.
The expert is coming tomorrow.
- What expert?
- The one I keep asking for!
The rural engineering expert.
The meeting will come to order.
This council meeting concerns the water problem.
Problem?
It's a disaster!
That's right, a disaster.
But thanks to my own efforts and my telephone...
I was able to get us a rural expert.
And here is the rural expert.
Gentlemen...
I have studied your problem... and here's the report I'm submitting to my chief.
Partridge Spring that fed your fountain... was the main source for this whole region.
It originated from a fissure between two layers of limestone.
The source is not diaclastic.
It is a Vauclusian resurgence.
Let's not confuse the two.
Thus, the water bed between two impervious strata leveled out... and the water issued forth along the upper stratum, under pressure.
This trapped pool supplied your basin by rising up... and the basin supplied your fountain through a series of pipes.
Yes, it's serious!
At the request of your mayor... and the administration... we researched the cause of this terrible accident.
First, where did your water originate?
Luckily we have this document.
Very interesting!
It's a study by the chief engineer... that spells out, clearly and to the point... some experiments made in this region five years ago.
Unfortunately, your spring does not appear on this valuable map... because it's not in the orography of the Huveaune River... or its tributaries.
Where does that leave us?
Since the water doesn't originate locally, it comes from far away.
I want to speak.
- Not now!
- I'll make it short!
Just let him turn on the water!
He can explain later!
I don't fix fountains.
The first theory is the drought.
A small drop in the ground water level may have caused your problem.
As the rising water is diverted by the parallel series of dolomites... and finally the Jurassic pattern... it should get through via a network of syphons.
You know what that is?
It's a rubber tube to draw wine.
Exactly.
At the first rain, the syphons are re-primed... as soon as the underground lake rises to its normal level.
An underground lake?
Of course!
And don't argue with progress.
You could be wrong.
If progress returns me my water, I'm for it!
And if my spring flows again, here's my 100 francs for progress!
Wait and hear the rest of this bullshit.
Now, the second theory.
The underground stream dropped into a network of caves.
Once they're filled... the water returns to its old level and the spring flows again.
How soon?
I can't tell you how long it might take.
Maybe two days... maybe two years.
Maybe 100 years.
That can't be ruled out.
Third theory...
To hell with your theories!
What can you do for us right now?
The administration will provide a daily truck with 1,300 gallons of water.
To cover your immediate daily needs.
How much water do I get for my carnations?
If our water hasn't returned in a month, what then?
We suggest you farm some land elsewhere.
What can I say?
Lots of villages have plenty of water.
No, sir... our council can't accept that!
Your council's power over natural phenomena is next to zero.
The third theory...
To hell with their theories!
We've got some administration!
And I say to hell with you!
You'll have to manage with the water truck.
It will be here in two days.
Meanwhile, gentlemen, good-bye!
Quiet!
Or else they'll send the police!
Where is he?
Where's the president of the Water Syndicate?
Who is the president?
It's not me, it's you!
I am because I'm the mayor, and that's because I have a phone!
And what is this?
- Your receipt.
- Right.
Fifty-two francs, plus the stamp.
You took my money.
Now where's my water?
Before you came, the expert explained about the orography.
You have to understand orography.
I don't give a damn!
I paid and I want my water!
Listen, they're sending a water truck every day.
Bring your mule... and you'll get 40 gallons like the rest of us.
One:
I have no mule, just a donkey.
Two: 40 gallons will do for a cafe, not for a field.
Three:
I paid for spring water, not truck water!
I'm sure they'll send spring water.
Not from my spring!
I paid and I want my water!
Stop yelling!
It's exhausting us and it won't help!
Holy Mother!
My poor eggplants.
My 600 beefsteak tomato plants!
But everyone is affected.
It's a major disaster.
Major, hell!
I paid and I want my water!
The spring stopped running.
Where should we get water?
Who cares?
Just make it run from my pipe.
And you, mind your own business!
You're a councilman, but I didn't vote for you!
- I don't need your vote.
- You pain in the ass!
Where do you think you are?
Surrounded by water thieves!
Good morning.
Today is my birthday.
After Mass you're invited for a drink.
We don't control what day we're born.
My brothers, I am truly glad... to see you all gathered in our little church.
The whole parish is here... including a group of intellectuals... who normally observe Holy Mass on the terrace of a coffee house.
I won't name it.
It's our only coffee house.
I won't name them either.
You all know them.
This ought to fill them with shame... were it not for their cynicism.
With clasped hands and moist eyes... you're full of faith and repentance today.
But God knows you're here because your spring stopped running... and your prayers are merely pleas for your string beans... orations for your tomatoes, hallelujahs for your artichokes... hosannas for your squash!
I must speak seriously about the spring.
I keep asking myself the same question.
Why is it... that this water, so plentiful until now... has suddenly dried up in the hour of our need?
I once read a Greek tragedy about the city of Thebes... that was struck by a calamitous plague... because of crimes committed by its king.
So I ask myself...
"Is there a criminal among us?"
It's not impossible... since the biggest crimes often escape human justice.
But God knows of them all!
I'll now speak to this unknown criminal, if he exists.
To him I say...
"My brother... there's no sin that cannot be forgiven... no crime that can't be atoned for... by sincere repentance"
Our Lord, Jesus Christ, said this astounding phrase:
"There is more room in heaven for one repentant sinner".
Whatever your offense, try to make amends.
Repent, and you shall be saved.
And your spring will flow better than before.
Papet.
He knows.
He looked at me three times.
What could he know?
He's only been here a year.
Maybe somebody told him in confession.
Anglade might have.
He's such a bigot that he might confess other people's sins.
What worries me is the girl.
Me too.
She seemed unfriendly to you.
She seemed to be saying, "You're the criminal".
No.
She knows nothing either.
Then what worries you?
I think she doesn't want you.
To our teacher's good health!
Here's to you!
What did you think of the sermon?
What do you expect?
It's just a lot of words.
I'm sure no act of God dried up the spring.
He seemed to allude to a crime he knew of.
Maybe he heard of it in confession and couldn't reveal more.
What crime?
If anyone here commits a crime, we'd all know.
No, I felt he had someone in mind.
- Then who?
- Yes, who?
He kept looking at Ugolin.
Yes, especially when he spoke of the plague.
- I'm a plague?
- Don't joke about such things.
You smelled our Pernod!
I came because of the water, not the Pernod.
I have to speak to you.
It's very important.
- To me?
- Yes.
You can bring our water back.
I could?
How?
By coming to the procession.
Will you?
Then our fountain won't ever flow again.
You think she's a saint?
An orphan's prayer... soars to heaven like a lark.
Our Lord will gladly listen to her song.
She's innocent.
If she prays for us, we're saved.
Manon, you must save our carnations!
I won't help those who stole my father's water!
I don't understand.
They understand!
They know why God is punishing them.
Tell us.
Do you know who the criminal is?
There are two.
There they are!
If we're treated like criminals, I'd rather go home.
Come, Galinette.
Your hurried departure might make us think...
I don't care what you think!
I think for myself.
Let's go.
- Come on!
- No.
I want to hear what she's accusing me of... because I can solve the whole problem.
Tell me how they stole your father's water.
But she's imagining things!
It's true her father's lack of water may have ruined him.
He would have found water, except for his accidental death.
The two women were in trouble... so we bought the little farmland.
Partly because we liked it, true.
But also to help them out!
Later we searched for the spring and, by sheer luck, we found it.
That's what she calls stealing his water.
"Help thy neighbor".
Some joke!
Let's go!
He's lying!
The truth is the spring was always there.
The truth is you blocked it off.
Why would they do that?
To buy it cheap.
Without water, the farm is worthless.
My father's dead, thanks to these assassins!
That's not true!
That's slander!
I found that spring with my watch.
You were there with your mother.
You held a squash.
Tell the truth!
Within less than an hour?
God said to Pascal:
"You wouldn't look for me... unless you'd already found me".
To hell with Pascal!
I only met him once.
He was so rude, I slapped him!
You laugh, but it's true.
Here's what we have.
She denies what she saw and believes what she didn't see.
Who saw us block up that spring?
Who saw us block up that spring?
Me.
I saw you.
I saw you both!
Liar!
What did you see, idiot?
You never knew left from right.
In the army, they put an "X" on his left hand.
He never understood, so they sent him home.
I planned it that way.
It wasn't easy, but it worked.
The major had his suspicions.
We're not interested in that.
Tell us what you saw.
He saw nothing.
- He was dreaming.
- I never dream!
It was nine or ten years ago.
See?
He's being vague.
It was after Bouffigue died.
It was at Romarins, hunting partridge.
They were drinking from a puddle near the empty farmhouse.
I picked the lock, went upstairs...
How nice!
Breaking into a dead man's house.
Bouffigue built two small windows under the gutter to shoot thrush.
First, I took a nap.
You see, he slept!
He was dreaming!
That was no dream!
Suddenly I heard digging sounds and woke up.
I watched through the window...
This one was digging.
The other watched.
I didn't dare move.
The water gushed out of the hole... then they blocked the spring with cement.
Why didn't you tell her father?
It wasn't my business.
But now God is punishing them and us.
Now it is my business.
Suppose he's telling the truth.
It's not true, but if it were...
I'm willing to give her the spring, my carnations... the farm, the money, the Soubeyran fortune... my life.
You know it.
I told you so in the hills.
I love you more than anything.
Listen.
Listen to me, Manon.
I see you and talk to you constantly.
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.
If you don't want me, I'll die or go crazy.
Shut up, idiot.
Let's go.
Just think about it.
What a terrible mixture... between my remorse... and the happiness I'd like to bring you.
Don't you know how I'll slave for you, my love?
Make him go away!
My love!
Don't be a fool.
Get up.
Think, Manon!
Just think.
I'll die over this love, and nobody'll care.
Galinette, come on home.
No!
It's all your fault!
I lost everything because of you!
If I had known...
Galinette, my boy!
I'll stay.
Since you're all against him, I'll defend him.
That won't be easy.
You all know there never was a spring at Romarins... just a puddle.
But I found the real spring!
Those of you who are natives like me... admit that there was no spring.
Listen carefully.
If you knew of a spring and didn't tell the hunchback... then you're responsible for his death.
The old bastard!
- You knew?
- Sure.
We all knew.
We didn't dare denounce them to defend an outsider.
He hated my grandmother.
They took it out on her son.
Who's your grandmother?
Florette.
They never forgave her for marrying a man from Crespin.
Florette was your grandmother?
The hunchback was Florette's son?
Papet wants to see you and the mayor.
He wants to see you too.
- Me?
- He said to hurry.
- He said you'll be glad.
- Where is he?
At Romarins.
What's wrong?
Put him on the table.
Right there.
Go tell the deaf one... to bring some candles from the church.
At least six big ones.
And the linen sheet his grandmother wove.
Pamphile, prepare the coffin.
You have the oak boards in the attic.
The ones I wanted for myself.
I know.
You're the one who ordered them.
Use them for him.
The rest of you, please... say he fell from a tree.
Keep this a secret... for three days... or the priest won't give him a proper burial.
Now you can leave.
I'm staying with you.
There's no need to.
She should have married him... and gotten her revenge by driving him crazy.
Papet, I'm leaving because I can't go on.
It's not the carnations.
It's because of my love.
I realize she'll never want me.
I suspected it because her ribbon burned my flesh.
And when I told her in public I wanted to marry her... she spat at me in a fury.
What's more, she fled towards the teacher.
When he talks to her, she lowers her eyes.
When he stops, she lingers until he continues.
And he takes her love for granted.
He's unaware of his happiness, but I know my misery.
I can't stand it.
I'd like to kill him.
But it would hurt her, and I'd never hurt her.
I leave her my farm and all that's hidden... you know where...
to the left of the fireplace.
Don't make any trouble.
It's not her fault or yours.
It's fate.
Arrange a Mass for me, because up there...
I'll have to explain about the spring.
Adieu, my Papet.
I'm sorry to leave you, but I can't stay.
You know?
I know.
What will you do?
I don't know.
I won't go back to that house.
Too many bad memories.
I'd keep seeing him hang where my swing used to be... and smell his odor in the house.
Will you join the procession?
If you're sure... that the water won't come back, you should go.
If your father could bring back the spring... what would he do?
He'd have liked to be their friend.
For his sake, do what he would have done.
You think this procession will help?
You never know.
I wonder how I would feel if the prayers worked.
I would feel forced to go to confession.
That's what worries me.
I know several fools who'd think like you... and I'd surely lose the elections.
Miracles can be very convincing.
Something's happening!
Stop!
It's breathing.
The pipe is blowing.
A miracle!
Kneel!
On your knees!
Kneel down, everybody!
It's not a miracle!
It's just a coincidence!
I recognized your footsteps.
Your ear is as sharp as an eye.
Ears can't replace eyes, Cesar.
Belly dancing is all very well... but you made a mistake when you were over there.
I did?
I said "mistake," but it was almost a crime.
I don't know what mistake you mean.
When I was wounded, they almost promoted me.
That's something else.
I'm talking about a letter you received.
What letter?
One that deserved an answer.
An answer that you never sent.
A letter from whom?
You don't want to tell me... because you think I don't know.
- I swear, Delphine!
- Don't swear, you sinner!
I'm sorry for reminding you of something unpleasant.
What is unpleasant?
From here I see the church... and a cross on top of the steeple.
I swear on that cross that I received no letter... except from my father and Anglade.
In that case, it's a tragedy.
Why?
Swear again that you're not lying to me.
I swear it.
Who wrote to me?
Florette.
Florette Camoins?
There was no other Florette.
Are you sure?
I, myself, gave the letter to the mailman.
I'd never have forgotten a letter from her.
I still have two faded notes she wrote to me... and a black comb from her hair.
It's true.
When I came back, she had left the village.
She was married to the blacksmith in Crespin... and she already had a child.
How could that letter have gotten lost?
Over there, we moved from place to place.
Sometimes our food and even our ammunition didn't reach us.
Some letters may have been lost too.
But if I had received that letter...
I would still know it by heart.
If that's true, it's dreadful.
You think she loved me?
You old fool.
She never told me so... not even after what happened between us one night... in Anglade's barn.
That's how she was.
In her letter... she told you that she was pregnant.
What?
Yes.
You had left three weeks before.
She told you if you wrote to her father... promising to marry her... she would wait for you.
She could have shown her letter to the whole village... and nobody would have dreamed of making fun of her.
Are you sure?
The poor girl couldn't sleep.
She tried to lose the baby with devilish potions.
She jumped from high rocks in the hills... but nothing worked.
Then she started hating you.
She went to the dance at Aubagne... where she found the blacksmith from Crespin.
So she left the village... and no one ever knew when the child was born.
Was it born alive?
Alive, yes... but it was a hunchback.
I hear Clarinette coming back.
Come on over, my girl.
It's getting chilly.
I'd rather sit by the fireplace.
Adieu, Cesar.
Don't worry.
I never told anyone.
I'm going to pray for you.
What's wrong, Papet?
Are you ill?
Don't stand here.
It's too cold.
Should I call a doctor?
I could call at the Ombres.
No, thanks.
I know what's wrong with me.
Lean on me.
I'll take you home.
My friend, I don't believe you are about to die.
But I believe I am.
I know I'll die tonight.
What makes you think so?
I'll die because I no longer want to live.
Hurry and confess me.
You'll see.
I have lots to confess.
You know that suicide is a mortal sin.
I won't need to kill myself.
I'll simply pass away.
Dear God, please don't let her baby be a hunchback.
Dear little Manon... the notary will tell you that I'm leaving you my whole estate.
It may surprise you, but it's the truth.
The notary will give you all the documents.
Because your father was my son.
He was the Soubeyran I'd hoped for all my life... whom I tormented to death... because I didn't know who he was.
If I had told him about the spring... he'd still be playing his harmonica... and you'd all be living in our family home.
No one knows it, but I'm too ashamed to face anyone... even the trees.
In the village, there's a person who knows.
She will tell you everything.
It's Delphine, the old blind woman.
She'll explain that it's all because of Africa.
I don't deserve to kiss you... and I never dared speak to you.
But maybe now you can forgive me... and even say a little prayer... for poor Ugolin and me.
I'm so pathetic, I even pity myself.
Out of sheer spite, I never went near him.
I never knew his voice or his face.
I never saw his eyes... that might have been like his mother's.
I only saw his hump and the pain I caused him.
Now you understand why I want to die.
Because next to my torments... even hell would be a pleasure.
Besides, I'll see him up there.
I'm not afraid of him.
Now he knows he's a Soubeyran... and it's not my fault that he's a hunchback.
He knows it was all a foolish mistake.
I'm sure that instead of blaming me... he'll defend me.
Farewell, my darling girl.
Your grandfather, Cesar Soubeyran.

Los Angeles
Next time I won't pay this much.
The competition from Italy is killing me.
This barely pays for the fertilizer.
Next year we'll grow chick-peas.
I'll miss having drinks with friends like you.
What's all this barking about?
I won't steal your herd.
Move over.
Leave me my bread!
Here, we'll share my lunch.
Well, now what will I eat?
Go on, move.
Bernard, what did you do today?
I explored the hill.
Look what I found.
Lignites.
This area is full of them.
Very interesting.
And I saw some unattended goats.
Must be the hunchback's daughter's herd.
I haven't seen the little savage since her dad died.
She hides from us.
I've seen her.
She's beautiful.
Her mother was a real beauty.
That hunchback hatched a lovely daughter.
Who was he?
You didn't know him.
It was before you moved here.
He was a city intellectual who played at being a farmer.
He was a nut.
He wasn't all that nutty.
I didn't say he was an idiot.
He just wasn't practical.
He tried breeding rabbits by multiplying numbers on paper.
Why?
Because he had no water.
But you found some.
Your carnations are doing well.
On holidays, mostly Christmas and Mardi Gras.
Easter is good too.
And the dead.
Aren't they good business?
Not bad.
Funerals bring good income.
Let's go.
Hurry up!
Thanks.
Here's a letter.
My darling...
Tonight we're doing Aida in Bordeaux.
I sing a small role, but I'm thrilled.
If only you were with me, I'd be truly happy.
Your loving mother.
You can't stay here forever.
You should go join your mother.
No hare or rabbit or partridge in sight.
Maybe I'm going deaf and blind.
Next time I'll bring the butcher's dog.
That hare won't get away!
Galinette!
Do you know it's fiive o'clock?
That's some nap.
I think I got sunstroke.
No, you're not red.
You must be needing sleep.
Come outside.
She can't hear, but she guesses everything.
What I'll say to you concerns only us two.
Galinette...
You're past 30, and you're the last of the Soubeyrans.
I know all that.
Don't interrupt!
If I keep saying it, it's your fault.
I'll say it until you understand.
We Soubeyrans were this region's most important family.
On Grandpa's birthday...
There were 30 of you.
All Soubeyrans, with cans of gold hidden throughout the house.
Everyone respected us.
It didn't last, but don't blame me.
That's fate.
There's no such thing as fate.
Good-for-nothings always blame fate!
It was the fault of our elders.
Because of pride and greed, they married among themselves.
Cousins married cousins.
An uncle married his niece.
That's bad for rabbits, and not good for people.
What's the result?
Two madwomen and three suicides.
Now there's only us two.
I don't count anymore.
So you're what's left of the Soubeyrans.
You want me to marry.
Why didn't you take a wife?
I wasn't cut out for it.
Mind you, I almost did... but it didn't work out.
I joined the army in Africa, on a whim... and when I came back...
If there had been a child, I'd gladly have married her.
But it didn't happen.
I'm like Anglade's cherry tree.
Many blossoms, but never any fruit.
So I should marry instead of you.
You have to, Galinette.
But why?
Why?
You're asking me why?
What about the Soubeyran fortune?
It's not banknotes that rats eat.
It's gold!
Cans full of gold coins.
Understand?
And I own them!
That's from savings, skimping and hard work.
You'd throw it all out?
Of course not.
I love gold.
Then don't leave it without an owner.
You can't ask me to start a family just like that.
I've asked you for ten years.
But not as seriously as today.
Besides, I have my own ideas.
You have someone in mind?
Maybe.
Won't you tell me who?
Listen, I was in the sun all day.
I feel woozy.
I'll tell you, but be patient.
Fine.
I like you, Galinette.
Just one more thing.
In choosing a wife, think of the children.
What do you mean?
Don't be enticed by a pretty face.
What we need is wide hips, long legs... and nice, big tits.
It's like choosing a brood mare.
What if she's also pretty?
If it's also, I won't mind.
On the contrary... she'd be the Soubeyran beauty.
I'd enjoy looking at her.
Over here, Noe!
Come!
Why is it always my turn?
The water is for everyone.
Cleaning the basin twice a year won't kill you.
This red sand and the dead leaves.
People need clean water.
So do vegetables.
This is strange.
Looks like clay, but it's not.
No... it's bauxite powder.
A mixture of iron and aluminum.
Where does it come from?
From the spring, after big storms.
It settles here... and never reaches the fountain.
After a rainy night... my spring water turns red and the stones look rusty.
It is rust, since it's iron oxide.
Then it can't hurt.
No.
It's actually good.
Where's your spring in relation to this basin?
What do you mean?
Is it higher up or below?
That's hard to say.
The Romarins valley is above here.
Then the village water comes from the same valley.
It's ten o'clock.
I promised they'd have water by noon!
That's two hours away.
But it takes an hour before it reaches the village.
I enjoy your company, but I must report to the mayor.
Don't keep him waiting, teacher.
Someone's throwing stones!
Wasn't that lightning?
You saw lightning?
You must have started drinking real early.
I swear I drank only coffee this morning.
That's my knife.
I lost it a few days ago.
- Around here?
- No.
I haven't been here before.
That's strange.
The shepherdess returned it to you.
- Where is she?
- What shepherdess?
- You mean Manon?
- The hunchback's Manon.
Who else?
Is she hiding here?
No, she ran away.
Too bad.
I wanted to thank her.
Some other time.
Thank her with a little kiss.
I don't know her, but I dreamt about her.
In my dream, I even kissed her.
Did she let you?
In my dreams, women don't resist me.
Aren't you eating?
I'm not hungry.
You haven't looked well lately.
I've lost my appetite.
Probably from that poison.
What poison?
The one I spray on my carnations... to kill the red spiders.
I'll do it for you.
No.
It has to be done at night.
Daylight is no good for it.
It weakens it.
It kills its effectiveness.
You work nights, but you don't sleep days.
You're never home.
What do you do all day?
I hunt.
I walk around on the hill.
I breathe in the fresh air... to clean out my lungs...
- from that poison.
- That's true.
It's good for the carnations, but bad for you.
Still, you should eat and sleep.
Want a doctor?
No.
I'll be all right.
See?
I'm eating.
She's going to Aubagne to sell my birds.
He's nuts.
Who is it?
It's me!
Yes, you're going crazy.
- Who is the woman?
- What woman?
The one you visit in Aubagne.
I've watched you for days.
You keep collecting birds.
What for?
I see you prancing and talking to yourself as if you're crazy!
Are you in love?
That's a good sickness.
Who is she?
You won't tell me.
Then she's either a tramp... or she's married.
That's it!
She's married!
She's married!
Open up!
No, I won't!
- We can talk through the door.
- Why?
If I don't see you, I might tell you.
You're as dopey as your poor mother.
Now, tell me.
I don't want to tell you anything.
Ask me questions.
Tell me who she is.
I won't tell you that.
A city girl?
Quite the opposite.
Even better.
Do I know her?
Actually, no.
What does that mean?
You're too clever.
After four questions, you'll know.
- Then...
I do know her.
- See?
I don't want to tell you.
You act like a cop, but I won't tell you.
Why not?
Because!
It's my secret.
My fiirst love secret, and I'm keeping it.
Keep it.
I'm leaving.
Good-bye.
No!
Stay!
I want to talk about her.
I don't even know who she is.
But I do, so I like talking about her.
Papet, did you leave?
No.
I'm rolling a cigarette.
So, you want to marry her?
Yes, but she won't want me.
- Why?
- She's pretty and I'm ugly.
Does she have money?
Not much.
- Is she healthy?
- Yes.
She's strong as a horse and has good little muscles.
She would do a better job on my carnations than me.
And she's educated too.
How do you know?
She's always reading books.
Sometimes for a whole hour.
That's no good.
A poor girl who reads books.
I don't like it.
Besides, a beautiful wife could mean trouble.
Is she honest?
She's the Holy Virgin of the hills.
If she'd marry me, I'd be happy as a king.
But she won't.
No poor girl ever rejected a Soubeyran.
Unless she's crazy.
If she said yes, would you consent?
I can't say until I know who she is.
You idiot!
Open up and tell me!
I won't open the door!
I have to think!
Papet...
I may tell you, but fiirst, swear by all the Soubeyrans... that when you hear her name, you won't say a word.
- As you like.
- No!
Swear it!
I swear it by all the Soubeyrans.
Good!
Now I have to decide.
I won't open the door.
I'll take out the key.
Put your ear next to the keyhole.
It's Manon, the hunchback's daughter.
Twenty years from now, you'll be too old for her.
- She'll have lovers.
- She wouldn't do that.
She's like all the others.
But never mind.
By then you'll have a house full of sturdy little Soubeyrans.
Since she's pretty, I give my consent.
You've seen her?
Yes, I have.
What's your opinion?
She's very pretty.
She seems mature for her age.
She must be 18 by now.
Know who she's like?
Nobody.
She looks like someone you never knew.
She looks exactly like her grandmother.
You knew her grandmother?
Florette Camoins... the beauty!
Miss, I'm glad to meet you... to thank you for my knife.
How did you know it was mine?
I saw you eating with it one day.
I'm the new teacher.
I'm collecting minerals in the hills... to teach my pupils the composition of their land.
There's no gold here.
It's Jurassic cretaceous from the second Quaternary era.
You're well-informed for a shepherdess.
I'm just quoting my dad.
I'd like you to keep this.
I've got one.
That one's too fancy for me.
No.
A shepherdess should have a shepherd's knife.
It has four blades, an awl and a nail fille.
And small scissors.
I know, because I used them.
It's the fiirst one I snared.
It's a baby.
The big ones get away.
That hare is my present to you.
My class starts soon.
I have to leave.
I'll leave this on a rock.
Someone is bound to fiind it.
She doesn't want your knife.
I'll keep it if you take the hare.
All right.
Thanks.
Papet...
How does one talk to girls?
I don't know any words of love.
So you've made up your mind?
Yes, I must hurry.
She could meet a man in Aubagne who might take her from me.
Where will you court her?
In the hills.
I'll pretend to look for mushrooms or snails... as if I didn't see her.
Not so fast.
If you're looking for mushrooms or snails... it makes you seem poor.
If you're rich, show it.
Don't wear your old clothes.
Wear a new suit, a real hunting outfiit... with leather leggins and a matching hat.
And above all... wear suspenders.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a hare I shot that must be wounded.
Aren't you Manon, the daughter of Monsieur Jean?
I see you don't remember me.
That's because I've changed a lot.
I'm Ugolin... your poor father's friend.
You've changed too.
You're a real young lady.
I hardly recognize you.
You may wonder why we never met before.
I'm too busy to hunt because of my carnations.
Did you know I grow carnations?
I've been very successful.
I've earned lots of money.
The money's all in gold coins!
In two years, with my savings, I'll be worth 50,000 francs.
Would you like to move back to Romarins?
I'd stay in my Massacan house... and you and Baptistina can tend my carnations.
Manon, listen to me!
I know why you don't want to!
It's because you're proud.
But your pride is no problem.
Carnations need watering, picking, and women know all about that.
I'll pay you!
I'll pay you very well!
It isn't to have you work.
I was lying.
It's because I love you.
I love you with all my heart.
Manon!
I want to marry you!
I'm all alone.
I have no one!
My grandparents are dead!
My father hanged himself.
My mother died of the flu!
There's only Uncle Papet!
He's rich.
He's old!
He's going to die!
He'll leave it all to me, and it'll be yours!
Because I love you!
I love you!
My love for you is choking me... making me ill.
I saw you bathing in the water holes.
I watched for hours, you were so beautiful.
I was afraid I'd commit a crime!
- You spoke to her?
- I didn't see her.
She must have gone to Aubagne.
Then do it tomorrow.
Maybe.
First I've got to get used to this outfiit.
You look great!
Like a hunter from Marseilles.
Look!
Do you see what I see?
A beautiful thrush.
That trap must belong to the hunchback's daughter.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
That is her herd.
She must be around here.
I won't touch it.
Other people's traps are sacred.
Especially hers.
That's her only livelihood.
She sells them at the Aubagne market.
She's proud.
We've already hurt her enough.
We didn't mean to.
We're not responsible.
We're all responsible.
We knew there was a spring at Romarins, but we said nothing.
Why didn't you speak up?
Because of Amelie.
- You want a bite?
- I sure do.
When I used to hunt at Romarins, I'd see... that poor hunchback look for water with his rod.
Once he was right above it, but the rod didn't bend.
Then he dug in the wrong spot.
That night I was upset... so I told Amelie.
What a scene!
She flew into a rage!
It was none of our business...
hunchbacks are bad luck... he was an outsider from Crespin, etc., etc.
You know how she is.
She made me swear to say nothing.
- So you didn't?
- No.
Ugolin and Papet are real bastards.
In that whole business, we were all bastards.
Papet!
My spring stopped running!
- What?
- No water!
None at all!
I dug down deep.
Not a drop!
Now what?
The carnations are budding!
- 15,000 of them.
- The well!
The well will be empty in two days.
Springs are capricious, especially yours.
- Give it three months.
- Three months!
Holy Mother!
Stop it, you fool!
The water is probably back by now.
And if not, with a few mules, we can hold out.
Let's take a look.
It used to flow.
When the hunchback came, it stopped.
Listen!
Something's wrong with our fountain.
It's just trickling.
Come and see!
That's not possible.
Here too!
Papet, we're ruined!
Calm down!
You see?
Could be a frog or a snake inside.
We're stuck, like Ugolin.
Impossible!
It hasn't stopped running in 50 years.
I'll go check out the basin.
Nothing!
I'm on my way.
Don't worry!
Monsieur Jean, have mercy.
You're up in heaven, so you can see... that my feet are so swollen that I can't wear shoes... that my mule is half-dead.
If this goes on, my carnations are ruined in eight days.
Come on.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost... give us back your daughter's spring.
Amen.
Help us!
Amen, damn it!
Yes, I'm the mayor.
When will you get here?
Tomorrow?
We'll all be dead!
He must come right away!
We have no bread.
Our crops are ruined.
It's a disaster!
Then I'll expect him tomorrow at the town hall.
The expert is coming tomorrow.
- What expert?
- The one I keep asking for!
The rural engineering expert.
The meeting will come to order.
This council meeting concerns the water problem.
Problem?
It's a disaster!
That's right, a disaster.
But thanks to my own efforts and my telephone...
I was able to get us a rural expert.
And here is the rural expert.
Gentlemen...
I have studied your problem... and here's the report I'm submitting to my chief.
Partridge Spring that fed your fountain... was the main source for this whole region.
It originated from a fiissure between two layers of limestone.
The source is not diaclastic.
It is a Vauclusian resurgence.
Let's not confuse the two.
Thus, the water bed between two impervious strata leveled out... and the water issued forth along the upper stratum, under pressure.
This trapped pool supplied your basin by rising up... and the basin supplied your fountain through a series of pipes.
Yes, it's serious!
At the request of your mayor... and the administration... we researched the cause of this terrible accident.
First, where did your water originate?
Luckily we have this document.
Very interesting!
It's a study by the chief engineer... that spells out, clearly and to the point... some experiments made in this region fiive years ago.
Unfortunately, your spring does not appear on this valuable map... because it's not in the orography of the Huveaune River... or its tributaries.
Where does that leave us?
Since the water doesn't originate locally, it comes from far away.
I want to speak.
- Not now!
- I'll make it short!
Just let him turn on the water!
He can explain later!
I don't flix fountains.
The fiirst theory is the drought.
A small drop in the ground water level may have caused your problem.
As the rising water is diverted by the parallel series of dolomites... and fiinally the Jurassic pattern... it should get through via a network of syphons.
You know what that is?
It's a rubber tube to draw wine.
Exactly.
At the fiirst rain, the syphons are re-primed... as soon as the underground lake rises to its normal level.
An underground lake?
Of course!
And don't argue with progress.
You could be wrong.
If progress returns me my water, I'm for it!
And if my spring flows again, here's my 100 francs for progress!
Wait and hear the rest of this bullshit.
Now, the second theory.
The underground stream dropped into a network of caves.
Once they're fiilled... the water returns to its old level and the spring flows again.
How soon?
I can't tell you how long it might take.
Maybe two days... maybe two years.
Maybe 100 years.
That can't be ruled out.
Third theory...
To hell with your theories!
What can you do for us right now?
The administration will provide a daily truck with 1,300 gallons of water.
To cover your immediate daily needs.
How much water do I get for my carnations?
If our water hasn't returned in a month, what then?
We suggest you farm some land elsewhere.
What can I say?
Lots of villages have plenty of water.
No, sir... our council can't accept that!
Your council's power over natural phenomena is next to zero.
The third theory...
To hell with their theories!
We've got some administration!
And I say to hell with you!
You'll have to manage with the water truck.
It will be here in two days.
Meanwhile, gentlemen, good-bye!
Quiet!
Or else they'll send the police!
Where is he?
Where's the president of the Water Syndicate?
Who is the president?
It's not me, it's you!
I am because I'm the mayor, and that's because I have a phone!
And what is this?
- Your receipt.
- Right.
Fifty-two francs, plus the stamp.
You took my money.
Now where's my water?
Before you came, the expert explained about the orography.
You have to understand orography.
I don't give a damn!
I paid and I want my water!
Listen, they're sending a water truck every day.
Bring your mule... and you'll get 40 gallons like the rest of us.
One:
I have no mule, just a donkey.
Two: 40 gallons will do for a cafe, not for a fileid.
Three:
I paid for spring water, not truck water!
I'm sure they'll send spring water.
Not from my spring!
I paid and I want my water!
Stop yelling!
It's exhausting us and it won't help!
Holy Mother!
My poor eggplants.
My 600 beefsteak tomato plants!
But everyone is affected.
It's a major disaster.
Major, hell!
I paid and I want my water!
The spring stopped running.
Where should we get water?
Who cares?
Just make it run from my pipe.
And you, mind your own business!
You're a councilman, but I didn't vote for you!
- I don't need your vote.
- You pain in the ass!
Where do you think you are?
Surrounded by water thieves!
Good morning.
Today is my birthday.
After Mass you're invited for a drink.
We don't control what day we're born.
My brothers, I am truly glad... to see you all gathered in our little church.
The whole parish is here... including a group of intellectuals... who normally observe Holy Mass on the terrace of a coffee house.
I won't name it.
It's our only coffee house.
I won't name them either.
You all know them.
This ought to filll them with shame... were it not for their cynicism.
With clasped hands and moist eyes... you're full of faith and repentance today.
But God knows you're here because your spring stopped running... and your prayers are merely pleas for your string beans... orations for your tomatoes, hallelujahs for your artichokes... hosannas for your squash!
I must speak seriously about the spring.
I keep asking myself the same question.
Why is it... that this water, so plentiful until now... has suddenly dried up in the hour of our need?
I once read a Greek tragedy about the city of Thebes... that was struck by a calamitous plague... because of crimes committed by its king.
So I ask myself...
''Is there a criminal among us?"
It's not impossible... since the biggest crimes often escape human justice.
But God knows of them all!
I'll now speak to this unknown criminal, if he exists.
To him I say...
''My brother... there's no sin that cannot be forgiven... no crime that can't be atoned for... by sincere repentance"
Our Lord, Jesus Christ, said this astounding phrase:
''There is more room in heaven for one repentant sinner."
Whatever your offense, try to make amends.
Repent, and you shall be saved.
And your spring will flow better than before.
Papet.
He knows.
He looked at me three times.
What could he know?
He's only been here a year.
Maybe somebody told him in confession.
Anglade might have.
He's such a bigot that he might confess other people's sins.
What worries me is the girl.
Me too.
She seemed unfriendly to you.
She seemed to be saying, ''You're the criminal."
No.
She knows nothing either.
Then what worries you?
I think she doesn't want you.
Happy birthday.
To our teacher's good health!
Here's to you!
What did you think of the sermon?
What do you expect?
It's just a lot of words.
I'm sure no act of God dried up the spring.
He seemed to allude to a crime he knew of.
Maybe he heard of it in confession and couldn't reveal more.
What crime?
If anyone here commits a crime, we'd all know.
No, I felt he had someone in mind.
- Then who?
- Yes, who?
He kept looking at Ugolin.
Yes, especially when he spoke of the plague.
- I'm a plague?
- Don't joke about such things.
You smelled our Pernod!
I came because of the water, not the Pernod.
I have to speak to you.
It's very important.
- To me?
- Yes.
You can bring our water back.
I could?
How?
By coming to the procession.
Will you?
Then our fountain won't ever flow again.
You think she's a saint?
An orphan's prayer... soars to heaven like a lark.
Our Lord will gladly listen to her song.
She's innocent.
If she prays for us, we're saved.
Manon, you must save our carnations!
I won't help those who stole my father's water!
I don't understand.
They understand!
They know why God is punishing them.
Tell us.
Do you know who the criminal is?
There are two.
There they are!
If we're treated like criminals, I'd rather go home.
Come, Galinette.
Your hurried departure might make us think...
I don't care what you think!
I think for myself.
Let's go.
- Come on!
- No.
I want to hear what she's accusing me of... because I can solve the whole problem.
Tell me how they stole your father's water.
But she's imagining things!
It's true her father's lack of water may have ruined him.
He would have found water, except for his accidental death.
The two women were in trouble... so we bought the little farmland.
Partly because we liked it, true.
But also to help them out!
Later we searched for the spring and, by sheer luck, we found it.
That's what she calls stealing his water.
''Help thy neighbor." Some joke!
Let's go!
He's lying!
The truth is the spring was always there.
The truth is you blocked it off.
Why would they do that?
To buy it cheap.
Without water, the farm is worthless.
My father's dead, thanks to these assassins!
That's not true!
That's slander!
I found that spring with my watch.
You were there with your mother.
You held a squash.
Tell the truth!
Within less than an hour?
God said to Pascal:
''You wouldn't look for me... unless you'd already found me."
To hell with Pascal!
I only met him once.
He was so rude, I slapped him!
You laugh, but it's true.
Here's what we have.
She denies what she saw and believes what she didn't see.
Who saw us block up that spring?
Who saw us block up that spring?
Me.
I saw you.
I saw you both!
Liar!
What did you see, idiot?
You never knew left from right.
In the army, they put an ''X" on his left hand.
He never understood, so they sent him home.
I planned it that way.
It wasn't easy, but it worked.
The major had his suspicions.
We're not interested in that.
Tell us what you saw.
He saw nothing.
- He was dreaming.
- I never dream!
It was nine or ten years ago.
See?
He's being vague.
It was after Bouffiigue died.
It was at Romarins, hunting partridge.
They were drinking from a puddle near the empty farmhouse.
I picked the lock, went upstairs...
How nice!
Breaking into a dead man's house.
Bouffiigue built two small windows under the gutter to shoot thrush.
First, I took a nap.
You see, he slept!
He was dreaming!
That was no dream!
Suddenly I heard digging sounds and woke up.
I watched through the window...
This one was digging.
The other watched.
I didn't dare move.
The water gushed out of the hole... then they blocked the spring with cement.
Why didn't you tell her father?
It wasn't my business.
But now God is punishing them and us.
Now it is my business.
Suppose he's telling the truth.
It's not true, but if it were...
I'm willing to give her the spring, my carnations... the farm, the money, the Soubeyran fortune... my life.
You know it.
I told you so in the hills.
I love you more than anything.
Listen.
Listen to me, Manon.
I see you and talk to you constantly.
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.
If you don't want me, I'll die or go crazy.
Shut up, idiot.
Let's go.
Just think about it.
What a terrible mixture... between my remorse... and the happiness I'd like to bring you.
Don't you know how I'll slave for you, my love?
Make him go away!
My love!
Don't be a fool.
Get up.
Think, Manon!
Just think.
I'll die over this love, and nobody'll care.
Galinette, come on home.
No!
It's all your fault!
I lost everything because of you!
If I had known...
Galinette, my boy!
I'll stay.
Since you're all against him, I'll defend him.
That won't be easy.
You all know there never was a spring at Romarins... just a puddle.
But I found the real spring!
Those of you who are natives like me... admit that there was no spring.
Listen carefully.
If you knew of a spring and didn't tell the hunchback... then you're responsible for his death.
The old bastard!
- You knew?
- Sure.
We all knew.
We didn't dare denounce them to defend an outsider.
He hated my grandmother.
They took it out on her son.
Who's your grandmother?
Florette.
They never forgave her for marrying a man from Crespin.
Florette was your grandmother?
The hunchback was Florette's son?
Papet wants to see you and the mayor.
He wants to see you too.
- Me?
- He said to hurry.
- He said you'll be glad.
- Where is he?
At Romarins.
What's wrong?
Put him on the table.
Right there.
Go tell the deaf one... to bring some candles from the church.
At least six big ones.
And the linen sheet his grandmother wove.
Pamphile, prepare the coffiin.
You have the oak boards in the attic.
The ones I wanted for myself.
I know.
You're the one who ordered them.
Use them for him.
The rest of you, please... say he fell from a tree.
Keep this a secret... for three days... or the priest won't give him a proper burial.
Now you can leave.
I'm staying with you.
There's no need to.
She should have married him... and gotten her revenge by driving him crazy.
Papet, I'm leaving because I can't go on.
It's not the carnations.
It's because of my love.
I realize she'll never want me.
I suspected it because her ribbon burned my flesh.
And when I told her in public I wanted to marry her... she spat at me in a fury.
What's more, she fled towards the teacher.
When he talks to her, she lowers her eyes.
When he stops, she lingers until he continues.
And he takes her love for granted.
He's unaware of his happiness, but I know my misery.
I can't stand it.
I'd like to kill him.
But it would hurt her, and I'd never hurt her.
I leave her my farm and all that's hidden... you know where...
to the left of the fireplace.
Don't make any trouble.
It's not her fault or yours.
It's fate.
Arrange a Mass for me, because up there...
I'll have to explain about the spring.
Adieu, my Papet.
I'm sorry to leave you, but I can't stay.
You know?
I know.
What will you do?
I don't know.
I won't go back to that house.
Too many bad memories.
I'd keep seeing him hang where my swing used to be... and smell his odor in the house.
Will you join the procession?
If you're sure... that the water won't come back, you should go.
If your father could bring back the spring... what would he do?
He'd have liked to be their friend.
For his sake, do what he would have done.
You think this procession will help?
You never know.
I wonder how I would feel if the prayers worked.
I would feel forced to go to confession.
That's what worries me.
I know several fools who'd think like you... and I'd surely lose the elections.
Miracles can be very convincing.
Something's happening!
Stop!
It's breathing.
The pipe is blowing.
A miracle!
Kneel!
On your knees!
Kneel down, everybody!
It's not a miracle!
It's just a coincidence!
I recognized your footsteps.
Your ear is as sharp as an eye.
Ears can't replace eyes, Cesar.
Belly dancing is all very well... but you made a mistake when you were over there.
I did?
I said ''mistake," but it was almost a crime.
I don't know what mistake you mean.
When I was wounded, they almost promoted me.
That's something else.
I'm talking about a letter you received.
What letter?
One that deserved an answer.
An answer that you never sent.
A letter from whom?
You don't want to tell me... because you think I don't know.
- I swear, Delphine!
- Don't swear, you sinner!
I'm sorry for reminding you of something unpleasant.
What is unpleasant?
From here I see the church... and a cross on top of the steeple.
I swear on that cross that I received no letter... except from my father and Anglade.
In that case, it's a tragedy.
Why?
Swear again that you're not lying to me.
I swear it.
Who wrote to me?
Florette.
Florette Camoins?
There was no other Florette.
Are you sure?
I, myself, gave the letter to the mailman.
I'd never have forgotten a letter from her.
I still have two faded notes she wrote to me... and a black comb from her hair.
It's true.
When I came back, she had left the village.
She was married to the blacksmith in Crespin... and she already had a child.
How could that letter have gotten lost?
Over there, we moved from place to place.
Sometimes our food and even our ammunition didn't reach us.
Some letters may have been lost too.
But if I had received that letter...
I would still know it by heart.
If that's true, it's dreadful.
You think she loved me?
You old fool.
She never told me so... not even after what happened between us one night... in Anglade's barn.
That's how she was.
In her letter... she told you that she was pregnant.
What?
Yes.
You had left three weeks before.
She told you if you wrote to her father... promising to marry her... she would wait for you.
She could have shown her letter to the whole village... and nobody would have dreamed of making fun of her.
Are you sure?
The poor girl couldn't sleep.
She tried to lose the baby with devilish potions.
She jumped from high rocks in the hills... but nothing worked.
Then she started hating you.
She went to the dance at Aubagne... where she found the blacksmith from Crespin.
So she left the village... and no one ever knew when the child was born.
Was it born alive?
Alive, yes... but it was a hunchback.
I hear Clarinette coming back.
Come on over, my girl.
It's getting chilly.
I'd rather sit by the fiireplace.
Adieu, Cesar.
Don't worry.
I never told anyone.
I'm going to pray for you.
What's wrong, Papet?
Are you ill?
Don't stand here.
It's too cold.
Should I call a doctor?
I could call at the Ombres.
No, thanks.
I know what's wrong with me.
Lean on me.
I'll take you home.
My friend, I don't believe you are about to die.
But I believe I am.
I know I'll die tonight.
What makes you think so?
I'll die because I no longer want to live.
Hurry and confess me.
You'll see.
I have lots to confess.
You know that suicide is a mortal sin.
I won't need to kill myself.
I'll simply pass away.
Dear God, please don't let her baby be a hunchback.
Dear little Manon... the notary will tell you that I'm leaving you my whole estate.
It may surprise you, but it's the truth.
The notary will give you all the documents.
Because your father was my son.
He was the Soubeyran I'd hoped for all my life... whom I tormented to death... because I didn't know who he was.
If I had told him about the spring... he'd still be playing his harmonica... and you'd all be living in our family home.
No one knows it, but I'm too ashamed to face anyone... even the trees.
In the village, there's a person who knows.
She will tell you everything.
It's Delphine, the old blind woman.
She'll explain that it's all because of Africa.
I don't deserve to kiss you... and I never dared speak to you.
But maybe now you can forgive me... and even say a little prayer... for poor Ugolin and me.
I'm so pathetic, I even pity myself.
Out of sheer spite, I never went near him.
I never knew his voice or his face.
I never saw his eyes... that might have been like his mother's.
I only saw his hump and the pain I caused him.
Now you understand why I want to die.
Because next to my torments... even hell would be a pleasure.
Besides, I'll see him up there.
I'm not afraid of him.
Now he knows he's a Soubeyran... and it's not my fault that he's a hunchback.
He knows it was all a foolish mistake.
I'm sure that instead of blaming me... he'll defend me.
Farewell, my darling girl.
Your grandfather, Cesar Soubeyran.
Manon of the Spring
Jean de Florette Part Two
Here.
Next time, I won't pay this much.
The competition from Italy is ruining me.
This barely pays for the fertilizer for the flowers.
Next year, we'll grow chickpeas.
I'd miss our aperitifs together.
What is it?
What are you barking at?
I'm not going to steal your goats.
Leave my bread alone!
Here, we'll share my lunch.
Hold on!
Hold on!
Leave some for me!
Come on!
It's not me. lt's him.
Go ahead.
-Hello, chaps!
-Hello.
What did you do today, Bernard?
I went for a walk in the hills.
Look what I found.
Lignite.
The hills are full of it.
Interesting.
I saw some goats, too.
-That's the herd of the hunchback's girl.
-The little savage?
She's been hiding from us since her father died.
I've seen her.
She's a real beauty.
She must take after her mother.
For a hunchback, he had a lovely daughter.
Who was this hunchback?
You never met him, Mr. Belloiseau.
You didn't live here then.
He was a city intellectual who wanted to be a farmer.
-He was a loony!
-l'm not so sure of it.
I'm not saying he was an idiot, but he just wasn't practical.
He thought he could breed rabbits by doing multiplications on paper.
Only because there was no water at Romarins.
But you found some.
How's the flower trade?
Christmas and Shrove Tuesday are best, and Easter is pretty good, too.
And the dead?
Aren't they good business?
Not bad at all.
They bring in a certain amount.
Come along!
Come along!
Let's go.
Hurry up!
Thank you.
There's a letter for you.
My darling, tonight, we're playing Aida in Bordeaux.
I've only got a small part, but I'm so pleased.
If only you were with me, I'd be truly happy.
Your loving mother.
You can't stay here forever.
You should be with your mother.
No hare or rabbit or birds.
Where have they got to?
Maybe I'm going deaf and blind.
Next time, I'll bring a hound along.
That hare won't get away!
Galinette!
Hey!
Do you know it's 5:00?
That's some nap.
I think I got sunstroke.
No, you're not red.
You must be short of sleep.
Come outside.
She can't hear, but she guesses everything.
What I have to say to you concerns only us two.
Galinette, you're past 30, and you're the last of the Soubeyrans.
I know all that...
Don't interrupt!
If I keep saying it, it's your fault.
I'll say it until you understand.
We Soubeyrans were this region's most important family.
-On Grandpa's birthday...
-There were 30 of you.
All Soubeyrans, with cans of gold hidden throughout the house.
Everyone respected us.
It didn't last, but don't blame me.
That's fate.
No!
There's no such thing as fate!
Good-for-nothings always blame fate!
It was the fault of our elders.
Because of pride and greed, they married among themselves.
Cousins married cousins.
An uncle married his niece.
It's bad for rabbits, and it's bad for people.
And what was the result?
Two madwomen and three suicides.
Now there's only the two of us.
I don't count anymore, so you're what's left of the Soubeyrans.
You want me to marry.
Why didn't you take a wife?
I wasn't cut out for it.
Mind you, I almost did, but it didn't work out.
I joined the army in Africa on a whim.
When I came back... lf there had been a child, I'd gladly have married her, but it didn't happen.
I'm like Anglade's cherry tree.
Lots of blossoms but never any fruit.
So I should marry instead of you.
You have to, Galinette.
-But why?
Why?
-Why?
You're asking me why?
What about the Soubeyran fortune?
This isn't paper money we're talking about. lt's gold!
Cans full of gold coins.
Understand?
And I own them !
That's from savings, skimping and hard work.
You'd throw it all away?
Of course not. I love gold.
Then don't leave it without an owner.
You can't ask me to start a family just like that.
I've asked you for 10 years.
But not as seriously as today.
Besides, I have my own ideas.
You have someone in mind?
Maybe.
Won't you tell me who?
Listen, I was in the sun all day.
I feel woozy.
I'll tell you, but be patient.
Fine.
You're a good boy, Galinette.
Just one more thing.
In choosing a wife, think of the children.
What do you mean?
Don't be enticed by a pretty face.
What we need is wide hips, long legs, and nice, big tits.
It's like choosing a brood mare.
What if she's also pretty?
If it's on top of it all, I wouldn't mind.
On the contrary, she'd be the Soubeyran beauty.
I'd enjoy looking at her.
Come on!
Come on!
Over here, Noe!
Come!
Why is it always my turn?
The water is for everyone.
Cleaning the basin twice a year won't kill you.
This red sand and the dead leaves.
-People need clean water.
-So do vegetables.
This is strange.
It looks like clay, but it's not.
No, it's bauxite powder, a mixture of iron and aluminum.
Where does it come from?
From the spring, after big storms.
It settles here and never reaches the village.
After a rainy night, my spring water turns red, and the stones look rusty.
It is rust. it's iron oxide.
-Then it can't hurt.
-No, it's actually good.
Where's your spring in relation to this tank?
What do you mean?
is it higher up or below?
That's hard to say.
The Romarins Valley is higher up.
Then the village water comes from the same valley.
It's 10:00.
I promised they'd have water by noon!
That's two hours away.
But it takes an hour to reach the village!
I enjoy your company, but I must report to the Mayor.
Don't keep him waiting.
Hey, someone's throwing stones!
Wasn't that lightning?
You saw lightning?
You must have started drinking very early.
I swear I drank only coffee this morning.
This is my knife. I lost it a few days ago.
-Around here?
-No.
I haven't been here before.
That's strange.
The shepherdess returned it to you.
-Where is she?
-What shepherdess?
You mean Manon?
Yes, the hunchback's Manon.
Who else?
-ls she hiding here?
-No, she ran away.
Too bad. I wanted to thank her.
Some other time.
-Thank her with a little kiss.
-lt's funny.
I don't know her, but I dreamt about her.
In my dream, I even kissed her.
Did she let you?
In my dreams, women don't resist me.
-Aren't you eating?
-l'm not hungry.
You haven't looked well lately.
I've lost my appetite.
It's probably from that poison.
What poison?
The one I spray on my carnations to kill the red spiders.
-l'll do it for you.
-No.
It has to be done at night.
Daylight is no good for it. lt weakens it.
It kills its effectiveness.
You work nights, but you don't sleep days.
You're never home.
What do you do all day?
I hunt. I walk around on the hill.
I breathe in the fresh air.
I need to clear my lungs of the poison.
That's true.
It's good for the carnations but bad for you.
Still, you should eat and sleep.
Want a doctor?
No, I'll be all right.
See?
I'm eating.
She's going to Aubagne to sell my birds.
He's nuts.
Who is it?
-lt's me.
-l know that!
-Who is the woman?
-What woman?
The one you visit in Aubagne.
I've watched you for days.
You keep collecting birds.
What for?
Are you going mad or what?
Are you in love?
That's a good sickness.
Who is she?
You won't tell me.
Then she's either a tramp or she's married.
Yes, yes, that's it!
She's married!
She's married!
She's married!
-Open up!
-No, I won't!
-We can talk through the door.
-Why?
If I don't see you, I might tell you.
You're as dopey as your poor father.
Now, tell me.
I don't want to tell you anything.
Ask me questions.
Tell me who she is.
I won't tell you that.
is it a city girl?
-Quite the opposite.
-Even better.
Do I know her?
Not really.
What does that mean?
You're too clever.
After four questions, you'll know.
-Then I do know her.
-See?
You know I don't want to tell you, but you insist on interrogating me!
-Well, I won't answer!
-Why not?
Because!
It's my secret.
It's my first love secret, and I'm keeping it.
Keep it. I'm leaving.
Goodbye.
No!
Stay!
I want to talk about her.
-l don't even know who she is.
-But I do, so I like talking about her.
Papet, did you leave?
No, I'm rolling a cigarette.
So you want to marry her?
Yes, but she won't want me.
-Why?
-She's pretty, and I'm ugly.
Does she have money?
Not much.
is she healthy?
Yes, she's strong as a horse and has good little muscles.
She would do a better job on my carnations than me.
-And she's educated, too.
-How do you know?
She's always reading books.
Sometimes for a whole hour.
That's no good.
A poor girl who reads books. I don't like it.
Besides, a beautiful wife could mean trouble.
-ls she honest?
-She's the Holy Virgin of the hills.
If she'd marry me, I'd be happy as a king, but she won't.
No poor girl ever rejected a Soubeyran, unless she's crazy.
If she said yes, would you consent?
I can't say until I know who she is.
You idiot!
Open up and tell me!
I won't open the door!
I have to think!
-Papet?
-Yeah?
I may tell you, but first, swear by all the Soubeyrans that when you hear her name, you won't say a word.
-As you like.
-No!
Swear it!
I swear it by all the Soubeyrans.
Good.
Now I have to decide.
I won't open the door. I'll take out the key.
Papet, put your ear next to the keyhole.
It's Manon, the hunchback's daughter.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
In 20 years' time, she'll think you're too old for her, and she might be unfaithful.
Not a girl like her.
She's like all the others, but never mind.
By then, you'll have a house full of sturdy little Soubeyrans.
Since she's pretty, I give my consent.
-You've seen her?
-Yes, I have.
-What's your opinion?
-She's very pretty.
She seems mature for her age.
She looks at least 18.
-You know who she looks like?
-Nobody!
Oh, yes.
She looks like someone you never knew.
She looks exactly like her grandmother.
You knew her grandmother?
Florette Camoins, the beauty.
Miss, I'm glad to meet you.
I wanted to thank you for my knife.
How did you know it was mine?
I saw you eating with it one day.
I'm the new teacher.
I'm collecting minerals from the hills to teach my pupils the composition of their land.
I thought you were looking for gold.
It's Jurassic cretaceous from the second Quaternary era.
You're well-informed for a shepherdess.
I'm just quoting my dad.
I'd like you to keep this.
I've got one.
-That one's too fancy for me.
-Not at all.
A shepherdess should have a shepherd's knife.
It has four blades, an awl and a nail file.
And small scissors.
I know because I used them.
It's the first one I snared. lt's a baby.
The big ones get away.
That hare is my present to you.
My class starts soon. I have to leave.
I'll leave this on a rock.
Someone is bound to find it.
She doesn't want your knife.
Mister!
I'll keep it if you take the hare.
All right.
Thanks.
Papet?
What?
How does one talk to girls?
I don't know any words of love.
So you've made up your mind?
Yes, I must hurry.
She could meet a man in Aubagne who might take her from me.
Where will you court her?
In the hills.
I'll pretend to look for mushrooms or snails as if I didn't see her.
Not so fast.
If you're looking for mushrooms or snails, it makes you seem poor.
If you're rich, show it.
Don't wear your old clothes.
Wear a new suit, a real hunting outfit, with leather leggings and a matching hat.
And above all, wear suspenders.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a hare I shot.
It must be wounded.
Aren't you Manon, the daughter of Monsieur Jean?
I see you don't remember me.
That's because I've changed a lot.
I'm Ugolin, your poor father's friend.
You've changed, too.
You're a real young lady.
I hardly recognize you.
You may wonder why we never met before.
I'm too busy to hunt because of my carnations.
Did you know I grow carnations?
I've been very successful.
I've earned lots of money.
The money's all in gold coins!
In two years, with my savings, I'll be worth 50,000 francs.
Would you like to move back to Romarins?
I'd stay in my Massacan house, and you and Baptistine can tend my carnations.
Manon, listen to me!
I know why you don't want to.
It's because you're proud, but your pride is no problem.
Carnations need watering, picking, and women know all about that.
I'll pay you!
I'll pay you very well!
Manon!
Manon!
Manon!
It isn't to have you work. I was lying.
It's because I love you. I love you, Manon.
I love you with all my heart.
Manon!
I want to marry you. I'm all alone.
I have no one.
My grandparents are dead.
My father hanged himself when I was little.
My mother died of the flu.
There's only Uncle Papet!
He's rich!
He's old!
He's going to die!
He'll leave it all to me.
It'll be yours because I love you!
I love you.
My love for you is choking me, making me ill.
I saw you bathing in the water holes.
I watched for hours.
You were so beautiful.
I was afraid I'd commit a crime!
-You spoke to her?
-l didn't see her.
She must have gone to Aubagne.
-Then do it tomorrow.
-Maybe.
First I've got to get used to this outfit.
You look great, like a hunter from Marseilles.
Look!
Do you see what I see?
A beautiful thrush.
That trap must belong to the hunchback's daughter.
-Are you sure?
-Yes.
That's her herd.
She must be around here.
I won't touch it.
Other people's traps are sacred, especially hers.
That's her only livelihood.
She sells them at the Aubagne market.
She's proud.
We've already hurt her enough.
We didn't mean to.
We're not responsible.
We're all responsible.
We knew there was a spring at Romarins, but we said nothing.
Why didn't you speak up?
Because of Amelie.
-You want a bite?
-l sure do.
When I used to hunt at Romarins, I'd see that poor hunchback look for water with his rod.
Once he was right above it, but the rod didn't bend.
Then he dug in the wrong spot.
That night, I was upset, so I told Amelie.
What a scene!
She flew into a rage.
"lt's none of our business!
Hunchbacks are bad luck!
"He's an outsider from Crespin! " And so on.
You know how she is.
She made me swear to say nothing.
-So you didn't?
-No.
Ugolin and Papet are real bastards.
Yeah, in that whole business, we were all bastards.
Come on!
Come along.
Papet!
My spring stopped running!
-What?
-No water!
-None at all?
-No. I dug down deep.
Not a drop!
-The carnations are budding!
-Fifteen thousand of them.
-You still have the well.
-The well will be empty in two days!
Springs are capricious, especially his.
Give it three months.
Three months!
Holy mother!
Stop it, you fool!
Get up!
The water is probably back by now, and if not, with a few mules, we can hold out.
-Let's go take a look.
-lt used to flow.
When the hunchback came, it stopped.
Then...
Hey!
Something's wrong with our fountain. it's just trickling.
-Come and see!
-That's not possible.
-Here, too!
Papet, we're ruined!
-Calm down.
Well?
Could be a frog or a snake inside.
We're stuck, like Ugolin.
lmpossible!
It hasn't stopped running in 50 years.
I'll go check out the tank.
Nothing.
-There.
-l'm on my way.
Don't worry.
Monsieur Jean, have mercy.
You're up in heaven, so you can see that my feet are so swollen that I can't wear shoes, that my mule is half-dead.
If this continues, my carnations will be ruined in eight days.
Come on, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, give us back your daughter's spring.
Amen.
Help us!
Amen, damn it!
Hello?
Yes, I'm the Mayor.
When will you get here?
Tomorrow?
We'll all be dead!
He must come right away!
We have no bread.
Our crops are ruined.
It's a disaster!
Then I'll expect him tomorrow at the town hall.
Thank you.
-The expert is coming tomorrow.
-What expert?
The one I keep asking for, the rural-engineering expert.
The meeting will come to order.
This council meeting concerns the water problem.
-Problem?
It's a disaster!
-That's right. lt's a disaster, but thanks to my own efforts and my telephone, I was able to get us a rural expert, and here is the rural expert.
Gentlemen, I have studied your problem, and here's the report I'm submitting to my chief engineer.
The Perdrix Spring which supplied your fountain was the main source for this whole region.
It originated from a fissure between two layers of limestone.
The source is not diaclastic.
It is a vauclusian resurgence.
Let's not confuse the two.
Thus, the water bed between two impervious strata leveled out, and the water issued forth along the upper stratum, under pressure.
This trapped pool supplied your basin by rising up, and the basin supplied your fountain through a series of pipes.
Yes, it's serious!
At the request of your mayor and the administration, we researched the cause of this terrible accident.
First, where did your water originate?
-Luckily we have this document.
-Very interesting!
It's a study by the chief engineer that spells out clearly and to the point some experiments made in this region five years ago.
Unfortunately, your spring does not appear on this valuable map.
There's no stream within the orography of the Huveaune River or its tributaries.
Fine.
Where does that leave us?
Since the water doesn't originate locally, it comes from far away.
-l want to speak.
-Not now!
I'll make it short.
Just let him turn on the water!
He can explain later!
I don't fix fountains.
The first theory is the drought.
A small drop in the groundwater level may have caused your problem.
The watercourse is determined by seams of dolomite in the limestone.
It can cross the seams via a network of siphons.
You know what that is?
It's a rubber tube to draw wine!
Exactly.
At the first rain, the siphons are reactivated as soon as the underground lake rises to its normal level.
An underground lake?
Of course!
To oppose progress is a sure sign of ignorance.
If progress gets me my water back, I'm for it, and if my spring flows again, here's my 100 francs for progress!
Here's 100 francs for progress!
Wait.
Listen to the rest of this nonsense.
Now, the second theory.
The underground stream dropped into a network of caves.
Once they're filled, the water returns to its old level and the spring flows again.
How soon?
I can't tell you how long it might take.
Maybe two days, maybe two years.
-Maybe 100 years.
-That can't be ruled out.
Third theory...
To hell with your theories!
What can you do for us right now?
The administration will provide a daily truck with 1,300 gallons of water to cover your immediate daily needs.
How much water do I get for my carnations?
If our water hasn't returned in a month, what then?
We suggest you farm some land elsewhere.
What can I say?
Lots of villages have plenty of water.
No, sir, our council can't accept that!
Your council's power over natural phenomena is next to zero.
-The third theory...
-To hell with their theories!
We've got some administration!
And I say to hell with you!
The water truck will be here in two days.
Meanwhile, gentlemen, goodbye!
Quiet, or else they'll send the police!
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where's the president of the water syndicate?
Who is the president of the water syndicate?
It's not me. lt's you!
I am because I'm the Mayor, and that's because I have the phone!
And what is this?
-Your receipt.
-Right.
Right, 52 francs, plus the stamp.
You took my money.
Now where's my water?
Before you came, the expert explained about the orography.
You have to understand orography.
I don't give a damn!
-l paid, and I want my water!
-Listen.
They're sending a water truck every day.
Bring your mule, and you'll get 40 gallons like the rest of us.
First, I have no mule, only a donkey.
Second, 40 gallons will do for a cafe, not for a field.
Third, I paid for spring water, not truck water!
I'm sure they'll send spring water.
Not from my spring!
I paid, and I want my water!
Stop yelling!
It's exhausting us, and it won't help!
Holy mother!
My poor eggplants!
My 600 beefsteak tomato plants!
Everyone is affected. lt's a major disaster.
"Major"?
I paid, and I want my water!
The spring stopped running.
Where should we get water?
Who cares?
Just make it run from my pipe.
And you, mind your own business!
You're a councilman, but I didn't vote for you!
-l don't need your vote!
-Who do you think you're talking to?
A bunch of water thieves!
-Stop!
Stop it!
-Stop!
-Stop!
-Stop it!
Good morning.
-Good morning.
-Today is my birthday.
After Mass, you're invited for a drink.
We don't control what day we're born.
My brothers, I am truly glad to see you all gathered in our little church.
The whole parish is here, including a group of intellectuals who normally observe Holy Mass on the terrace of a cafe.
I won't name it. lt's our only cafe.
I won't name them, either.
You all know them.
This ought to fill them with shame, were it not for their cynicism.
With clasped hands and moist eyes, you're full of faith and repentance today, but God knows you're here because your spring stopped running, and your prayers are merely pleas for your string beans, orations for your tomatoes, hallelujahs for your artichokes,
hosannas for your squash!
I must speak seriously about the spring.
I keep asking myself the same question.
Why is it that this water, so plentiful until now, has suddenly dried up in our hour of need?
I once read a Greek tragedy about the City of Thebes, which was struck by a calamitous plague because of crimes committed by its king.
So I ask myself,
"ls there a criminal among us?"
It's not impossible, since the biggest crimes often escape human justice, but God knows of them all.
I'll now speak to this unknown criminal, if he exists.
To him I say,
"My brother, there's no sin that cannot be forgiven,
"no crime that cannot be atoned for
"by sincere repentance."
Our Lord Jesus Christ said this astounding phrase,
"There is more room in heaven for one repentant sinner
"than for 100 self-righteous men."
Whatever your offense, try to make amends.
Repent, and you shall be saved, and your spring will flow better than before.
-Papet.
-Yes.
He knows.
He looked at me three times.
What could he know?
He's only been here a year.
Maybe somebody told him in confession.
Anglade might have.
He's such a bigot that he might confess other people's sins.
-What worries me is the girl.
-Me, too.
She seemed unfriendly to you.
She seemed to be saying, "You're the criminal."
-No, she doesn't know anything, either.
-Then what worries you?
I think she doesn't want you.
city OF AUBAGNE
Happy birthday.
-To our teacher's good health!
-Thank you.
-Happy birthday!
-Here's to you!
What did you think of the sermon?
What do you expect?
It's just a lot of words.
I'm sure no act of God dried up the spring.
He seemed to allude to a crime he knew of.
Maybe he heard of it in confession and couldn't reveal more.
What crime?
If anyone here committed a crime, we'd all know.
No, I felt he had someone in mind.
-Then who?
-Yes, who?
He kept looking at Ugolin.
Yes, especially when he spoke of the plague.
-Are you saying I have the plague?
-Don't joke about such things.
-You smelled our Pernod!
-l came because of the water.
I have to speak to you. lt's very important.
-To me?
-Yes.
You can bring the water back.
I could?
How?
By coming to the procession.
Will you?
Then our fountain won't ever flow again.
You think she's a saint?
An orphan's prayer soars to heaven like a lark.
Our Lord will gladly listen to her song.
She's innocent.
If she prays for us, we're saved.
Manon, you must save our carnations!
I won't help those who stole my father's water!
I don't understand.
They understand.
They know why God is punishing them.
Tell us.
Do you know who the criminal is?
There are two.
There they are.
If we're to be treated like criminals, I'd rather go home.
Come, Galinette.
Your hurried departure might make us think... I don't care what you think!
My conscience is clear.
Let's go.
-Come on.
-No.
I want to hear what she's accusing me of because I can solve the whole problem.
Tell me how they stole your father's water.
But she's imagining things.
It's true her father's lack of water may have ruined him.
He would have found water, except for his accidental death.
The two women were in trouble, so we bought the little farmland.
Partly because we liked it, true, but also to help them out.
Later, we searched for the spring and, by sheer luck, we found it.
That's what she calls stealing his water.
"Help thy neighbor." Some joke!
Let's go!
It's not true.
He's lying!
The truth is the spring was always there.
The truth is you blocked it off.
-Why would they do that?
-To buy it cheap.
Without water, the farm is worthless.
My father's dead, thanks to these assassins!
That's not true!
That's slander!
I found that spring with my watch.
You were there with your mother.
You held a squash.
-Tell the truth!
-Within less than an hour?
The spring might well say to you what God said to Pascal,
"You wouldn't look for me unless you'd already found me."
To hell with Pascal!
I only met him once.
He was so rude, I slapped him !
You laugh, but it's true.
Here's what we have.
She denies what she saw and believes what she didn't see.
Who saw us block up that spring?
Who saw us block up that spring?
I saw you.
I saw you both.
Liar!
What did you see, idiot?
You could never even tell left from right.
In the army, they put a mark on his left hand and two on his right.
He never understood, so they sent him home.
I planned it that way.
It wasn't easy, but it worked.
The Major had his suspicions...
We're not interested in that right now.
Tell us what you saw.
He saw nothing.
He was dreaming.
I never dream !
It was nine or 10 years ago.
-See?
He's being vague.
-lt was after Pique-Bouffigue died.
I was at Romarins, hunting partridge.
They were drinking from a puddle near the empty farmhouse.
-l picked the lock, went upstairs...
-How nice!
Breaking into a dead man's house.
Pique-Bouffigue built two small windows under the gutter to shoot thrush.
First, I took a nap.
You see?
He slept.
He was dreaming.
That was no dream !
Suddenly, I heard digging sounds and woke up.
I watched through the window.
This one was digging, while the other watched.
I didn't dare move.
The water gushed out of the hole.
Then they blocked the spring with cement!
Why didn't you tell her father?
It wasn't my business, but now God is punishing them and us.
Now it is my business!
Suppose he's telling the truth, and it's not true, but if it were, I'm willing to give her the spring, my carnations, the farm, the money, the Soubeyran fortune, my life.
You know it. I told you so in the hills.
I love you more than anything.
Listen.
Listen to me, Manon.
I see you and talk to you constantly.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.
If you don't want me, I'll die or go crazy.
Shut up, idiot.
Let's go.
Just think about it.
What a terrible mixture!
All my remorse for the harm I've caused you and all the happiness I'd like to bring you.
Don't you know how I'd slave for you?
-Oh, my love!
-Make him go away!
My love...
Don't be a fool.
Get up.
Think, Manon.
Just think.
I'll die over this love, and nobody will care.
Galinette, come on home.
No!
It's all your fault!
I lost everything because of you!
If I had known...
Galinette, my boy!
I'll stay.
Since you're all against him, I'll defend him.
That won't be easy.
You all know there never was a spring at Romarins, just a puddle,
but I found the real spring!
Those of you who are natives like me, admit that there was no spring.
Listen carefully.
If you knew of a spring and didn't tell the hunchback, then you're responsible for his death.
-The old bastard.
-You knew?
Sure.
We all knew.
We didn't dare denounce them to defend an outsider.
He hated my grandmother.
They took it out on her son.
Who's your grandmother?
Florette.
They never forgave her for marrying a man from Crespin.
Florette was your grandmother?
The hunchback was Florette's son?
Sir!
Sir!
Papet wants to see you and the Mayor.
-Papet wants to see you.
-Yes?
-You, too.
-Me?
He said to hurry.
-Where is he?
-At Romarins.
He's waiting for you.
What could Cesar want?
Put him on the table.
Right there.
Go to the village.
Tell the mute woman to bring some candles from the church, at least six big ones,
and the linen sheet his grandmother wove.
Pamphile, prepare the coffin.
You'll find the oak boards in the attic, the ones I wanted for myself.
I know.
You're the one who ordered them.
Use them for him.
The rest of you, please, say he fell from a tree.
Keep this a secret for three days, or the priest won't give him a proper burial.
Now you can leave.
-l'm staying with you.
-There's no need to.
She should have married him and gotten her revenge by driving him crazy.
Papet, I'm leaving because I can't go on.
It's not the carnations.
It's because of my love.
I realize she'll never want me.
I suspected it because her ribbon burned my flesh, and when I told her in public I wanted to marry her, she spat at me in a fury.
What's more, she fled towards the teacher.
When he talks to her, she lowers her eyes.
When he stops, she lingers until he continues.
And he takes her love for granted.
He's unaware of his happiness, but I know my misery.
I can't stand it. I'd like to kill him, but it would hurt her, and I'd never hurt her.
I leave her my farm and all that's hidden, you know where, to the left of the fireplace.
Don't make any trouble.
It's not her fault or yours.
It's fate.
Arrange a Mass for me because up there, I'll have to explain about the spring.
Farewell, my Papet.
I'm sorry to leave you, but I can't stay.
You know?
I know.
What will you do?
I don't know.
I won't go back to that house.
Too many bad memories.
I'd keep seeing him hang where my swing used to be and smell his odor in the house.
Will you join the procession?
If you're sure that the water won't come back, you should go.
If your father could bring back the spring, what would he do?
He'd have liked to be their friend.
For his sake, do what he would have done.
-You think this procession will help?
-You never know.
I wonder how I would feel if the prayers worked.
I would feel terrible.
I would feel forced to go to confession.
That's what worries me.
I know several fools who'd think like you, and I'd surely lose the elections.
Miracles can be very convincing.
Something's happening.
Stop!
Stop!
It's breathing. lt's breathing!
The pipe is blowing!
A miracle!
Kneel!
On your knees!
Kneel down, everybody!
It's not a miracle.
It's just a coincidence.
I recognized your footsteps.
Your ear is as sharp as an eye.
Ears can't replace eyes, Cesar.
Belly dancing is all very well, but you made a mistake when you were over there.
I did?
I said "mistake," but it was almost a crime.
I don't know what mistake you mean.
When I was wounded, they almost promoted me.
That's a different matter.
I'm talking about a letter you received.
What letter?
One that deserved an answer, an answer that you never sent.
A letter from whom?
You don't want to tell me because you think I don't know.
-l swear, Delphine...
-Don't swear, you sinner!
I'm sorry for reminding you of something unpleasant.
What is unpleasant?
From here, I see the church and a cross on top of the steeple.
I swear on that cross that I received no letter, except from my father and Anglade and Castagne.
In that case, it's a tragedy.
Why?
Swear again that you're not lying to me.
I swear it.
Who wrote to me?
Florette.
Florette Camoins?
There was no other Florette.
Are you sure?
I myself gave the letter to the postman.
I'd never have forgotten a letter from her.
I still have two faded notes she wrote to me and one of her combs.
It's true.
When I came back, she had left the village.
She was married to the blacksmith in Crespin,
and she already had a child.
How could that letter have gotten lost?
Over there, we moved from place to place.
Sometimes, our food and even our ammunition failed to reach us.
Some letters may have been lost, too.
But if I had received that letter, I would still know it by heart.
If that's true, it's dreadful.
-You think she loved me?
-You old fool.
She never told me so.
Not even after what happened between us one night in Anglade's barn.
That's how she was.
In her letter, she told you that she was pregnant.
-What?
-Yes.
You had left three weeks before.
She told you if you wrote to her father, promising to marry her, she would wait for you.
She could have shown your letter to the whole village, and nobody would have dreamed of making fun of her.
Are you sure?
The poor girl couldn't sleep.
She tried to lose the baby with devilish potions.
She jumped from high rocks in the hills, but nothing worked.
Then she started hating you.
She went to the dance at Aubagne, where she found the blacksmith from Crespin, so she left the village, and no one ever knew when the child was born.
Was it born alive?
Alive, yes, but it was a hunchback.
I hear Clairette coming back.
Come on over, my girl. lt's getting chilly.
I'd rather sit by the fireplace.
Farewell, Cesar.
Don't worry. I never told anyone.
I'm going to pray for you.
-What's wrong, Papet?
Are you ill?
-No, no.
Don't stand here.
Find some refuge.
-Should I call a doctor?
-No.
-l could call the Ombrees.
-No, thanks.
I know what's wrong with me.
Lean on me. I'll take you home.
My friend, I don't believe you're about to die.
But I believe I am.
I know I'll die tonight.
What makes you think so?
I'll die because I no longer want to live.
Hurry and hear my confession.
You'll see. I have lots to confess.
You know that suicide is a mortal sin.
I won't need to kill myself.
I'll simply pass away.
I need to get out.
I'd like to get out. i'm sorry.
I need to get out.
Dear God, please don't let her baby be a hunchback.
Dear little Manon, the notary will tell you that I'm leaving you my whole estate.
It may surprise you, but it's the truth.
The lawyer will give you all the documents because your father was my son.
He was the Soubeyran I'd hoped for all my life, whom I tormented to death because I didn't know who he was.
If I had told him about the spring, he'd still be playing his harmonica, and you'd all be living in our family home.
No one knows it, but I'm too ashamed to face anyone, even the trees.
In the village, there's a person who knows.
She will tell you everything.
It's Delphine, the old blind woman.
She'll explain that it's all because of Africa.
I don't deserve to kiss you, and I never dared speak to you, but maybe now you can forgive me and even say a little prayer for poor Ugolin and me.
I'm so pathetic, I even pity myself.
Out of sheer spite, I never went near him.
I never knew his voice or his face.
I never saw his eyes, which might have been like his mother's.
I only saw his hump and the pain I caused him.
Now you understand why I want to die, because next to my torments, even hell would be a pleasure.
Besides, I'll see him up there.
I'm not afraid of him.
Now he knows he's a Soubeyran.
He's no longer a hunchback because of me.
He knows it was all a foolish mistake.
I'm sure that instead of blaming me, he'll defend me.
Farewell, my darling girl.
Your grandfather, Cesar Soubeyran.
Here.
Next time I won't pay this much.
The competition from Italy is ruining me.
This barely pays for fertiliser for the flowers.
Next year we'll grow chick peas.
I'd miss our aperitifs together.
What is it?
What are you barking at?
I'm not going to steal your goats.
Leave my bread alone!
Here, we'll share my lunch.
Hold on...
leave some for me!
- Hello, chaps!
- Hello.
What did you do today, Bernard?
I went for a walk in the hills.
Look what I found.
Lignite.
The hills are full of it.
Interesting.
- I saw some goats.
- It's the hunchback's girl's herd.
The little savage!
She's been hiding from us since her father died.
I've seen her.
She's a real beauty.
She must take after her mother.
For a hunchback, he had a lovely daughter.
Who was this hunchback?
You never met him, Mr Belloiseau.
You didn't live here then.
He was a city intellectual who wanted to be a farmer.
- He was a loony!
- I'm not so sure of it.
I'm not saying he was an idiot but he just wasn't practical.
He thought he could breed rabbits by doing sums on paper.
Only because there was no water at Romarins.
But you found some.
How's the flower trade?
Christmas and Shrove Tuesday are best, and Easter's pretty good, too.
How about deaths?
Not bad at all.
They bring in a certain amount.
Come along!
Quick!
Thank you.
There's a letter for you.
My darling,
Tonight we're playing Ai'da in Bordeaux.
I've only got a small part, but I'm so pleased.
If only you were with me, I'd be almost happy.
Your loving mother.
You can't stay here for ever.
You should be with your mother.
No hares, no rabbits, no birds...
Where have they got to?
Maybe I'm going deaf and blind.
Next time I'll bring a hound along.
That one won't get away.
Galinette!
Do you know it's five o'clock?
That was some nap!
I think I must have caught the sun.
No, you're not red.
You must be short of sleep.
Come on out.
She may be deaf, but she guesses everything.
What I've got to say is just between the two of us.
Galinette, you're past thirty, and you're the last of the Soubeyrans.
I know all that...
Don't interrupt!
If I'm repeating myself, that's your fault.
I'll talk till you understand.
We Soubeyrans were the most important family of this region.
- On Grandpa's birthday...
- There were more than 30 guests.
All of them Soubeyrans, with pots of gold hidden about the place.
We were respected.
Well, things have changed.
That's fate.
No!
Fate doesn't exist.
What happened to us is the fault of our elders.
They were proud and wanted to hold on to their money.
Cousins married cousins.
One uncle married his niece.
It's just as bad for men as for rabbits.
And what was the result?
Two madwomen and three suicides.
Now, it's just us.
It's too late for me, so it's all up to you.
You're telling me to get married.
Why didn't you?
I wasn't cut out for it.
Mind you, I almost did...
It didn't work out.
I joined up on an impulse and went to Africa.
When I came back...
If she'd given me a child, I'd have married her like a shot.
But it didn't happen.
I'm like Anglade's cherry trees:
lots of flowers, but no fruit.
- So I'm to marry instead of you?
- You've got to, Galinette.
But why should I?
Why?
You ask me why!
Isn't the Soubeyran fortune reason enough?
This isn't paper money we're talking about.
It's gold!
Pots full of gold coins.
Do you understand?
I own a fortune!
The fruit of saving, skimping and hard work.
- Do you want to chuck it all away?
- Of course not!
I love gold.
If you love it, you can't deprive it of a loving owner!
Papet, I can't make a family just like that!
- I've been telling you to for years!
- Now that you're more serious,
I'd rather make up my own mind.
Have you got your eye on someone?
Maybe.
Can't you tell me who?
Look, I've been out in the sun all day and I feel a bit dazed.
I will tell you, but not yet.
Fine.
You're a good boy, Galinette.
But one thing more...
When choosing a wife, think of the children.
What do you mean?
Don't get stuck on a pretty face.
We need a girl with wide hips, long legs and big tits!
Think of her as a brood mare.
What if she's pretty besides?
If it's besides, I won't object...
On the contrary.
I'd enjoy looking at a pretty Soubeyran.
Come on!
Over here, Noe!
Come on!
We do all the work even though everyone uses the water.
Cleaning the tank twice a year won't kill you!
What with this sand, if we want clean drinking water...
Better for vegetables, too.
It's not sticky.
It looks like clay, but it's not clay.
It's bauxite powder.
A mixture of iron and aluminium.
I wonder where it's from.
The spring deposits it here after big storms, but it doesn't reach the village.
The morning after a rainy night, my spring water's the colour of rust.
It is rust: it's iron oxide.
- Then it's not harmful.
- No, it's beneficial.
Where is your spring in relation to this tank?
What do you mean?
Is it higher up or lower down?
It's hard to say.
I think the Romarins spring is higher up.
The village water must come from here and follow the same course.
- It's ten o'clock.
- I said I'd have the water on by noon!
That's two hours away.
But it takes an hour for it to reach the village.
Much though I enjoy your company, I have to see the mayor.
Don't keep him waiting!
Hey!
Someone's throwing stones!
I saw a flash of lightning!
At ten o'clock?
You must have started drinking early.
I swear I've had only a coffee!
It's my knife.
I lost it in the hills a few days ago.
- Around here?
- No.
I've never been here before.
- That's very odd.
- It's a gift from the goatherd.
- Which goatherd?
Do you mean Manon?
- Yes, the hunchback's kid.
Who else?
- Is she hiding up there?
- She'll have run away.
Too bad!
I'd like to thank her.
- Some other time!
- Thank her with a little kiss.
It's odd.
After all that talk, I dreamt about her the other night.
- In my dream, I kissed her.
- Did she let you?
In my dreams women rarely resist me.
- Aren't you eating?
- I'm not hungry.
You haven't looked well lately.
I've lost my appetite.
It's probably the poison.
What poison?
The one I spray on my carnations to kill the spiders.
- I'll do it for you.
- No.
You have to use it at night.
Sunlight does it no good.
It makes it less potent.
Daylight destroys its effectiveness.
You work at night, but don't sleep days.
You're never home.
What do you do with yourself all day long?
I go hunting and wander about the hills.
I breathe fresh air.
I need to clear my lungs of the poison.
True.
It's good for the carnations but bad for you.
You've got to eat and sleep.
- Do you want to see the doctor?
- No, I'll be all right.
See?
I'm eating.
She's going to Aubagne to sell my birds.
He's going mad!
- Who is it?
- Me!
- I know that!
Who's the woman?
- What woman?
The one you've been following to Aubagne.
I've been watching you.
And what about those birds you've been catching?
Are you going mad, or what?
Are you in love?
That's a great illness!
So who is she?
If you won't tell me, she can't be altogether nice... or else she's married.
Yes, yes, that's it!
She's married.
She's married!
- Open up, imbecile!
- No, I won't!
- We can talk through the door.
- Why?
If I can't see you, I might tell you something.
You're as mad as your poor father.
What do you want to tell me?
I don't want to, but you're insisting, so ask away!
Tell me who she is!
No, I won't!
- A city girl?
- On the contrary!
Good!
Do I know her?
- Not really.
- What do you mean?
You're bound to guess who it is.
So I know her?
See?
You know I don't want to tell you, but you insist on interrogating me.
- Well, I won't answer.
- Why not?
Because...
Because it's my secret.
My first secret love.
In that case, I'm going.
Bye!
No, stay here!
I want to talk about her.
- I don't even know who she is.
- But I do!
Papet, are you going?
No, I'm rolling a cigarette.
So, you want to marry her?
Yes, but she won't have me.
- Why not?
- She's pretty and I'm ugly.
Has she got money?
Not much.
Is she healthy?
Yes, she's as strong as a horse.
She's got good muscles.
She could do a good job on my carnations.
- And she's educated.
- How do you know?
She reads books for hours at a time.
That sounds bad.
I'm wary of a poor girl who reads books.
Besides, a beautiful wife may be fickle.
Is she virtuous?
Wild and pure as the driven snow.
She'd be a wonderful wife.
I'd be happy as a king but she wouldn't want me.
No poor girl would reject a Soubeyran... unless she's mad.
If she said yes, would you consent?
I can't until I know who she is.
Come on, you fool!
Open up and tell me!
No!
I can't open the door!
I've got to think.
- Papet...
- Yes?
I'll tell you, but you must swear on the family name that when you hear her name you won't say a word.
- As you like.
- No!
Swear to me!
I swear on the name of the Soubeyrans.
Good.
Now I've got to decide.
I'm not opening the door;
I'm just taking out the key.
Put your ear next to the keyhole.
It's Manon, the hunchback's daughter.
In 20 years' time, she'll think you too old for her and she might be unfaithful.
Not a girl like her.
She's just like the rest of them.
But never mind.
By then you'll have your family of sturdy Soubeyrans.
She's lovely.
You have my consent.
- Have you seen her?
- Yes, I have.
- What do you think?
- I told you.
She's lovely.
She seems mature for her age.
She looks at least 18.
- Do you know who she looks like?
- Nobody.
Yes, she does.
She looks like someone you never knew.
- Her grandmother.
- Did you know her?
Florette Camoins.
The great beauty.
I'm glad to meet you at last.
I wanted to thank you for my knife.
- How did you know it was mine?
- I saw you eating with it the other day.
I'm the new teacher.
I'm making a collection of local rocks so I can teach my pupils about their land.
I thought you were a gold-digger.
It's all cretaceous, from the Quaternary era.
You know a lot for a country girl.
My father taught me.
- I'd like you to keep this.
- I've got one.
- That one's too fancy for me.
- It's not!
Why shouldn't a goatherd have a good knife?
It's got four blades and a nail file.
And some scissors.
I know.
I used them.
It's the first one I've trapped.
It's a baby.
The hawks eat the big ones.
That hare's my offering to you.
My class begins soon.
I've got to go.
I'll leave this on a rock.
Someone will be glad to find it.
She doesn't want your knife.
- I'll keep it if you take the hare.
- Fine.
Thanks.
- Papet...
- Yes.
What's the best way to talk to girls?
I don't know how to talk about love.
So, you've made up your mind?
Yes.
I'd better hurry because she often goes to Aubagne and she might meet a man who'll take her from me.
- Where will you talk to her?
- In the hills.
I'll pretend I'm gathering snails and didn't see her.
Hang on!
If you do that, it'll look as if you're poor.
Show your wealth!
Don't wear your old clothes.
You should wear a new suit, a hunting outfit with leather leggings and a hat to match.
And most important of all...
Wear braces!
Excuse me...
I'm looking for a hare I shot which must be wounded.
Aren't you Manon, the daughter of poor Monsieur Jean?
I see you don't remember me.
That's because I've changed a lot.
I'm Ugolin, your poor father's friend.
You've changed, too.
You're a proper little lady.
I barely recognised you.
Perhaps you're wondering why we haven't met before.
I don't have time to hunt any more because of my carnations.
Did you know I grew carnations?
I've been very successful.
I've made lots of money.
The money's all in gold coins!
With my savings, I'll be worth 50,000 francs in two years.
Would you like to move back to Romarins?
I could stay in my house in Massacan and you could tend to my flowers.
Manon, listen to me!
I know why you don't want to.
It's because you're proud.
But your pride's no problem.
Carnations must be watered and picked.
A woman will do that well.
I'll pay you.
You'll be well paid.
It's not to give you work.
I was lying.
It's because I love you.
I love you with all my heart!
Manon!
I want to marry you!
I'm all alone!
I've got no-one!
My grandparents are dead.
My father hanged himself when I was little.
My mother died of the flu.
There's only Uncle Papet!
He's rich, he's old.
He's going to die.
He's going to leave me all his money.
It'll be yours, because I love you!
I love you!
I am sick for the love of you.
It's suffocating me!
I saw you bathing in the rainwater.
I watched for hours.
You were so lovely.
I was tempted to commit a crime.
- Did you talk to her?
- I didn't see her.
- She must have gone to Aubagne.
- Then do it tomorrow.
Maybe.
I have to get used to this outfit.
You look great!
Like a hunter from Marseilles.
- Look!
See that?
- A nice little thrush.
- That girl must have trapped it.
- Really?
Yes.
See?
There's her herd.
She can't be far off.
I always respect other people's traps.
And it's this poor girl's only livelihood.
I've seen her selling birds in Aubagne.
- We've done her enough harm already.
- Not on purpose.
It wasn't our fault.
It was.
We all knew there was a spring at Romarins but no-one said anything.
- So why didn't you tell him?
- Because of Amelie.
- Shall we eat?
- Let's.
I used to go hunting over there and see that poor hunchback dowsing for water.
Once, he was right above it but the rod didn't move.
Later, I saw him digging in the wrong place and it kept on bothering me.
I told Amelie and she flew into such a rage.
It was none of our business.
Hunchbacks are bad luck.
He was an outsider, from Crespin, etc, etc.
You know what she's like.
She made me swear to say nothing.
- So you didn't?
- No.
- Ugolin and Papet were real bastards.
- On that score, we were all bastards.
- Papet, my spring's dried up!
- What?
- No water.
- None at all?
No.
I dug a deep hole.
Not a drop.
- My carnations are budding.
- 1 5,000 of them.
- There's your tank.
- In two days, it'll be empty.
Springs are capricious.
I bet it'll flow again in three months.
Three months!
Oh, Lord!
Stop it, you fool!
Get up!
It's probably already flowing again.
If not, we can transport enough water using a few mules.
It used to flow.
When the hunchback came, it stopped...
Hey!
There's something wrong with the fountain.
- Come and see.
- Impossible!
- Not here, too?
We're ruined!
- Calm down!
Well?
There must be a frog blocking the pipe.
We're stuck, like Ugolin.
Impossible!
It's flowed for 50 years.
Let's check the tank.
Nothing.
- Right.
I'm off.
- Don't worry.
Monsieur Jean, you're a good man and you're up in heaven.
You can see that my feet are so swollen I can hardly walk, that my mule's half dead.
If this continues, my carnations will be ruined.
Please, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, give us back your daughter's spring.
Amen.
Help us!
Amen, damn it!
Hello?
Yes, I'm the mayor.
How soon can he get here?
Tomorrow?
We'll be dead by then!
We need him now.
We've got no bread.
Our crops are ruined.
It's a catastrophe.
Then I'll expect him at seven at the public hall.
Thank you.
- The expert will be here tomorrow.
- What expert?
The Rural Engineering expert I've been asking for.
I declare the meeting open.
We're meeting to discuss the problem of water.
- It's not a problem: it's a disaster!
- Quite right.
But thanks to my personal initiative and my phone, the local authority has sent us expert help.
This is the expert.
Gentlemen, I've studied your problem, and this is what I shall report to the Chief Engineer.
The Perdrix spring which supplied your fountain is the main source of water for this whole region.
It runs between two layers of limestone.
The spring is not diaclistic, but a Vauclusian resurgence.
Let's not forget that, eh?
Thus, the water flowed between two impervious strata, pressing against the upper layer.
The pressure generated forced water into the tank.
Gravity then ensured the flow of water from the tank to the village.
Right.
Gravity.
At the request of your mayor and with local authority permission, we have examined the cause of the present obstruction.
First, where is the source of the water?
I have here a useful document...
It's an analysis by the Chief Engineer clearly stating the results of experiments made in the region some five years ago.
Sadly, there's no indication whatever of a spring in this area.
There's no stream within the orography of the Huveaune river.
What does that mean?
The source of your water is some way away.
- I want to speak.
- This isn't the time.
I'll make it short.
Just let him turn on the water.
He can explain later.
I'm not a plumber.
Now, the first hypothesis is drought.
The trouble may be due to a drop in the water table.
The watercourse is determined by seams of dolomite in the limestone.
It can cross the seams via a network of siphons.
You know what that is?
You use them in winemaking.
Precisely.
During the rainy season, the siphons are reactivated as soon as the water table rises to its normal level.
What table?
Quiet!
To oppose progress is a sure sign of ignorance!
If progress turns my water on, I'm all for it, and, if my spring flows again, here's my 100 francs for progress.
Let's hear the rest... the rest of his rubbish.
Now, the second hypothesis.
The subterranean stream drops into a network of cavities.
Once they're full, the water rises and the spring will flow again.
- How soon?
- I really couldn't say.
Perhaps in two days, perhaps in two years.
Or a hundred years!
That's not to be ruled out.
Third hypothesis...
To hell with your theories!
What can you do for us right now?
The administration can provide a daily truck with 1 ,300 gallons of water.
That should cover your daily needs.
How much do I get for my flowers?
If we've got no water by next month, what'll you do?
We'd suggest you farm the land elsewhere.
There's no lack of villages where water is plentiful.
Our council can never accept that!
Your council's influence on natural phenomena is next to zero.
- The third hypothesis...
- To hell with their hypo-thingies!
The administration's just a waste of time!
In that case, the administration says you can go to hell!
The water truck will be here in two days.
Meanwhile, gentlemen, I wish you good luck.
Where is he?
Where's the head of the Water Board?
I'm not the head of the Water Board:
you are!
Only because I'm the mayor and I've got a phone.
- See this?
What's this?
- It's your receipt.
Right. 52 francs plus the stamp.
So, where's the water I paid for?
The expert explained it's the orography.
That's the whole problem.
I don't give a damn!
I paid for my water and I want it.
Listen...
They'll send a lorry of water daily.
Just bring your mule and you'll get 40 gallons of water like the rest of us.
One:
I haven't got a mule, only a donkey.
Two: 40 gallons are enough for a cafe but not my field.
Three:
I paid for spring water, not truck water.
- The truck water must be spring water.
- Not from my spring!
I want my water.
Stop yelling.
You're driving us mad.
What about my aubergines?
And my tomatoes are just ripening.
It's the same for everyone.
Damn that!
I've paid and I want my water.
The spring's dry.
How can we get water?
I don't care, as long as I get mine back.
And you - mind your own business!
You may be a councillor but I didn't vote for you.
Who cares about your vote?
- Why us?
Who do you think we are?
- Water thieves!
Stop!
Stop it!
Good morning.
Today's my birthday and I'd like to invite you over for a drink after Mass.
I had no say over my birth date.
Dearly beloved, I am truly happy to see you all gathered in our little church.
The whole parish is here, including some clever folks - too clever, perhaps - who generally ignore Mass and hang around in the cafe.
I won't name it - it's our only cafe - or name them, since everyone's staring at them already.
I hope this shames them, rather than making them laugh.
Your hands are joined, your eyes moist.
Today you are all steeped in faith.
But God knows that your piety is due to your spring and that your prayers are merely pleas for your beans, orisons for your tomatoes, hallelujahs for your potatoes, and hosannas for your marrows!
Now, I must speak seriously about the spring.
I keep asking myself the question:
Why has this water, once so plentiful, suddenly dried up in our hour of need?
I once read in a Greek tragedy, a profane work of literature, that Thebes was struck by a calamitous plague because its king had committed some crimes.
And so I ask myself:
Is there a criminal among us?
It's quite possible, since many wicked crimes escape the justice of men, but the Good Lord knows all about them!
So, if this criminal does exist, let me now appeal to him.
Let me say to him:
My brother, there's no sin that cannot be forgiven, no crime that can't be atoned for by the most sincere repentance.
According to Jesus Christ himself, there will always be room in heaven for a repentant sinner.
So, whatever your offence, try to redeem yourself.
Repent and you shall be saved!
And our spring will flow again as before.
- Papet!
- Yes?
He meant us.
He looked at me three times.
What could he know?
He's only been here for a year.
Maybe somebody told him in confession.
It's possible Anglade did it.
He's so self-righteous that he's liable to confess other people's sins.
- I'm worried about the girl.
- So am I.
She seemed hostile to you.
She looked at me twice, as if to say "You're the criminal".
- No, she knows nothing.
- Then why are you worried?
I don't think she wants you.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
Here's to our teacher's good health.
Here's to you!
- What did you think of that sermon?
- Nothing.
It's just a lot of talk.
I can't believe the spring dried up through an act of God.
He implied it was a criminal act.
He probably learnt about it through someone's confession.
What crime?
If someone here was guilty, we'd all know about it.
I'm sure he had someone in mind.
- Who?
- Yes, who?
- He looked at Ugolin a lot.
- Especially when he mentioned plague.
- I haven't got the plague!
- You shouldn't joke about such things.
- You smelled the Pernod!
- No, I came on account of the water.
- I've got something important to say.
- To me?
Yes.
You can bring our water back.
How can l?
By coming to the procession.
Will you?
If you refuse, our fountain will never flow again.
She's not a saint!
An orphan's prayer soars heavenwards like a lark.
Our Lord will listen to her.
She's innocent.
If she prays for us, we're saved.
Manon, you must come and save our flowers!
I won't pray for people who robbed my father.
I don't understand you.
They do.
They know why God is punishing them.
Do you know who the criminal is?
There are two of them.
Them.
I've had enough of this nonsense.
I'm going home.
Come on, Galinette.
- Your reaction might arouse suspicion...
- I don't care what you suspect.
My conscience is clear.
Let's go home!
- Come on!
- No.
I want to hear what she's got against me.
I can settle the whole matter.
- How did they steal your father's water?
- She's imagining things.
It's true that her father's lack of water ruined him.
But for his fatal accident, he might have found it.
Since the two women were in trouble, we bought the farmstead...
Partly because we liked it - that's true - but partly, too, to help them out.
Later on, purely by chance, we found the spring.
She calls that stealing her water.
Help thy neighbour - some joke!
Let's go.
It's not true!
He's lying!
He knew that spring was on our land.
What really happened is that you deliberately blocked it up.
- Why would they do that?
- To buy it cheap.
The dry land was worthless.
- Those two murdered my father!
- That's not true!
It's slander!
I found that spring with my watch.
You and your mother saw me looking for it.
- Tell the truth!
- In less than one hour?
God said to Pascal:
"You wouldn't look for me unless you'd already found me."
To hell with Pascal!
I only met him once.
He was so rude I slapped him.
You laugh, but it's true!
She denies what she saw, but she believes what she didn't see.
Who saw us block that spring?
You see!
Who saw us block it up?
I saw you.
Both of you.
Liar!
What did you see?
You don't know left from right!
In the army, he failed every test.
He was so stupid they sent him home.
That was exactly what I wanted.
It wasn't easy, but I got away with it...
Never mind that.
Tell us what you saw.
He saw nothing.
He dreamt it.
I never dream.
It was nine or ten years ago.
- See how vague he is?
- Just after Bouffigue died.
I was hunting at Romarins.
The partridges were drinking from a puddle near the empty farm, so I went inside.
Charming behaviour!
Stealing from a dead man's house!
It was so I could shoot the partridges from an upstairs window.
- First, I snoozed for a while.
- I knew it: he was dreaming.
I wasn't dreaming!
Suddenly, there was the sound of digging and it woke me up.
I saw them from the window - one digging and the other looking on.
I didn't dare move.
I saw the water gush out and then I saw them block the spring.
Why didn't you tell her father?
It was none of my business, but now we're all being punished it is my business.
Suppose that what he's said is true...
It's not, but let's just suppose it is...
You know I'd give her everything:
the spring, my flowers, my house, my money, the Soubeyran fortune and my life.
You know that.
I told you so in the hills.
I love you unbearably.
Listen...
Please listen, Manon.
Ever since I saw you, ever since I spoke to you, food has been turning to sawdust in my mouth, sleep's been a torment...
If you reject me, I'll die or go mad.
Shut up, you fool.
Let's go.
Just think how I feel.
I'm all mixed up, what with remorse for the harm I've done you and the happiness I want to offer you.
You must know how I'd slave for you!
- Oh, my love!
- Make him go away!
Don't be a fool!
Stand up!
Manon, you must realise, I'm going to die for the love of you, and no-one cares!
Galinette, come home!
No!
It's all your fault!
I've lost everything because of you.
If only I'd known.
Galinette, my boy!
I'm staying.
Since you're all against him, I'll defend him.
I don't see how you can.
You all know there was no spring at Romarins - just a puddle.
But I found the real spring.
You men, you're natives like me:
tell him there was no spring.
Listen: anyone who knew there was one and didn't tell the hunchback is responsible for his death.
- The old bastard!
- You knew!
Of course.
We all knew.
But we didn't dare denounce them to protect an outsider.
They hated my grandmother and wanted revenge.
Who's your grandmother?
Florette.
It's because she married a man from Crespin.
Florette was your grandmother?
Then the hunchback was Florette's son?
Papet says he wants to see you and the mayor.
- Papet wants to see you both.
- Me?
He said to come quickly.
- Where is he?
- At Romarins, waiting for you.
What can Cesar want?
Put him on the table.
Put him here.
Go to the village and tell the woman to bring some candles from the church.
At least six big ones...
And the linen sheet his grandmother wove...
Pamphile, prepare the coffin.
You've got those oak boards in the attic... the ones I wanted for myself.
The ones you asked me to order.
Use them for him.
Can I ask you all to say he fell from a tree.
Keep the suicide secret until after the funeral.
Otherwise the priest won't want to bury him properly.
Now you can all go.
- I'll stay with you.
- There's no need to.
She should have married him anyhow and avenged herself by making his life hell on earth.
Papet, I can't go on living.
I don't care about the carnations;
it's because of my love.
She'll never love me.
I suspected so because I've got an infection from her ribbon.
And when I told her I wanted to marry her, she spat at me in a fury.
Besides, she prefers the teacher.
When he talks to her, she lowers her eyes.
When he stops, she's eager for him to start again.
He doesn't even think about it, but takes it for granted.
He's a happy man, and I'm miserable.
I can't bear it any longer.
I'd like to kill him, but that would grieve her, so I won't deprive her of him.
I'm giving her my farm and what's hidden next to the fireplace.
You know where.
Don't make any trouble.
It's not her fault or yours: it's just fate.
Arrange a Mass for me.
I'll have to account for the spring up there.
Adieu, Papet.
I'm sorry to leave you, but I can't go on living.
Do you know?
Yes.
What will you do?
I don't know.
I won't go back to that house.
Too many bad memories.
I'd always think of his body on the tree... and his smell in the house.
Will you join the procession?
If you're absolutely sure the water won't come back, you should go.
If your father could have brought back their spring, what would he have done?
I think he'd have wanted their friendship.
If that's so, you must do likewise.
- Do you think the procession will help?
- You never know.
We'll see if the fountain responds to our prayers.
If it does, I'll have to go to confession.
That's the trouble:
if the water comes back, every fool might feel like you and I'll end up losing the election.
Miracles are very convincing.
Something's happening...
Stop!
It's gurgling!
There's a gurgling in the pipe.
A miracle!
On your knees!
On your knees, everybody!
It's not a miracle!
It's just a coincidence.
I recognised your footsteps.
Your ears are sharp.
My hearing can't replace my eyesight, Cesar.
Belly dancing's all very well, but you made a mistake in going to North Africa.
I did?
I say mistake, but it was almost a crime.
What mistake do you mean?
When I was wounded, I was about to be promoted.
That's not what I meant.
I'm talking about the letter you received.
- What letter?
- One that deserved an answer... but you failed to respond.
A letter from whom?
You don't want to talk to me about it because you think I don't know.
- I swear, Delphine.
- Don't swear, you sinner!
I'm sorry to be stirring up a bitter memory.
A bitter memory?
Delphine, we're beside the church, in the presence of the cross.
I swear by that cross that I received no letter except from my father, Anglade and Castagne.
If that's the truth, it's tragic.
Why?
Swear again that you're not lying to me.
I swear it.
Who wrote to me?
Florette.
Florette Camoins?
There was no other Florette.
Are you sure?
I gave the letter to the postman.
I'd never have forgotten a letter from her.
I still have two faded notes she wrote me... and one of her combs.
That's it.
When I came back, she'd left the village.
She'd married that blacksmith from Crespin.
She already had a child.
Is it possible her letter didn't reach you?
Over there we kept on moving around.
Sometimes we didn't get food or even ammunition.
It's definitely possible that letters got lost as well.
But if there'd been one from her
I'd know it by heart.
If that's true, it's dreadful!
- Do you think she loved me?
- You old fool!
She never admitted it... not even after what we did one night in Anglade's barn.
That's just the way she was.
But in her letter she wrote that she was pregnant.
- What?
- Yes.
You'd been gone three weeks.
She said that if you wrote to promise her father to marry her, she'd wait for you.
She'd have shown your letter to everybody so that no-one would laugh at her.
Are you sure?
The poor girl couldn't sleep.
She tried to get rid of the baby with magic potions.
She jumped from high rocks in the hills, but nothing worked.
She came to hate you.
She went to Aubagne, where she met that blacksmith from Crespin.
So she left the village and no-one ever knew when the child was born.
Was it alive?
Yes, alive.
But a hunchback.
I hear Clairette coming for me.
Come on over, girl.
It's getting chilly.
I want to sit by the fireside.
Adieu, Cesar.
Don't worry.
I've never told anyone.
I'll pray for you.
- What's wrong, Papet?
Are you ill?
- No, no.
Don't stay out here.
Come inside.
- Shall I call a doctor?
- No.
- I could call through to Ombrees.
- No.
I know what's wrong with me.
Lean on me.
I'll take you home.
My friend, I don't believe you're near death.
I believe I am.
I know I'm going to die tonight.
Why do you think so?
I'll die because I don't want to live.
Let's get on with the confession.
You can see I need to confess.
Remember, suicide is a cardinal sin.
I've no need to kill myself.
I'll simply let myself go.
Please God, don't let her baby be a hunchback.
Dear little Manon,
I am leaving you my whole estate.
You may wonder why, but it's the truth.
The solicitor will give you all the documents.
It's because your father was my son, the Soubeyran I'd hoped for all my life.
I tormented him to death because I didn't know who he was.
If I'd told him about the spring, he'd still be playing his harmonica and you'd all be living in our family home.
No-one knows about it, but even so, I'm bitterly ashamed.
In the village, there's one person who'll tell you the truth.
It's Delphine, the old blind woman.
She'll explain how it's all because of Africa.
I don't deserve to kiss you and I never dared to speak to you, but maybe now you can forgive me and even pray for poor Ugolin and me.
Even I find myself a pitiable being.
I think it was because of spite that I never went near him.
I never heard his voice or saw his face or his eyes, which might have been like his mother's.
All I saw was his hump and the grief I caused him.
You'll understand why I want to die.
I'm so hounded by my miserable thoughts that even hell will be a blessed release.
I'm not afraid to see him up there, now he knows he's a Soubeyran and it's not my fault he's a hunchback.
He realises it was all a foolish mistake.
I'm sure he won't resent me, but will even defend me.
Farewell, my darling girl.
Your grandfather, Cesar Soubeyran.
Next time I won't pay this much.
The competition from Italy is killing me.
This barely pays for the fertilizer.
Next year we'll grow chick-peas.
I'll miss having drinks with friends like you.
What's all this barking about?
I won't steal your herd.
Move over.
Leave me my bread!
Here, we'll share my lunch.
Well, now what will I eat?
Go on, move.
Bernard, what did you do today?
I explored the hill.
Look what I found.
Lignites.
This area is full of them.
Very interesting.
And I saw some unattended goats.
Must be the hunchback's daughter's herd.
I haven't seen the little savage since her dad died.
She hides from us.
I've seen her.
She's beautiful.
Her mother was a real beauty.
That hunchback hatched a lovely daughter.
Who was he?
You didn't know him.
It was before you moved here.
He was a city intellectual who played at being a farmer.
He was a nut.
He wasn't all that nutty.
I didn't say he was an idiot.
He just wasn't practical.
He tried breeding rabbits by multiplying numbers on paper.
Why?
Because he had no water.
But you found some.
Your carnations are doing well.
On holidays, mostly Christmas and Mardi Gras.
Easter is good too.
And the dead.
Aren't they good business?
Not bad.
Funerals bring good income.
Let's go.
Hurry up!
Thanks.
Here's a letter.
My darling...
Tonight we're doing Aida in Bordeaux.
I sing a small role, but I'm thrilled.
If only you were with me, I'd be truly happy.
Your loving mother.
You can't stay here forever.
You should go join your mother.
No hare or rabbit or partridge in sight.
Maybe I'm going deaf and blind.
Next time I'll bring the butcher's dog.
That hare won't get away!
Galinette!
Do you know it's five o'clock?
That's some nap.
I think I got sunstroke.
No, you're not red.
You must be needing sleep.
Come outside.
She can't hear, but she guesses everything.
What I'll say to you concerns only us two.
Galinette...
You're past 30, and you're the last of the Soubeyrans.
I know all that.
Don't interrupt!
If I keep saying it, it's your fault.
I'll say it until you understand.
We Soubeyrans were this region's most important family.
On Grandpa's birthday...
There were 30 of you.
All Soubeyrans, with cans of gold hidden throughout the house.
Everyone respected us.
It didn't last, but don't blame me.
That's fate.
There's no such thing as fate.
Good-for-nothings always blame fate!
It was the fault of our elders.
Because of pride and greed, they married among themselves.
Cousins married cousins.
An uncle married his niece.
That's bad for rabbits, and not good for people.
What's the result?
Two madwomen and three suicides.
Now there's only us two.
I don't count anymore.
So you're what's left of the Soubeyrans.
You want me to marry.
Why didn't you take a wife?
I wasn't cut out for it.
Mind you, I almost did... but it didn't work out.
I joined the army in Africa, on a whim... and when I came back...
If there had been a child, I'd gladly have married her.
But it didn't happen.
I'm like Anglade's cherry tree.
Many blossoms, but never any fruit.
So I should marry instead of you.
You have to, Galinette.
But why?
Why?
You're asking me why?
What about the Soubeyran fortune?
It's not banknotes that rats eat.
It's gold!
Cans full of gold coins.
Understand?
And I own them!
That's from savings, skimping and hard work.
You'd throw it all out?
Of course not.
I love gold.
Then don't leave it without an owner.
You can't ask me to start a family just like that.
I've asked you for ten years.
But not as seriously as today.
Besides, I have my own ideas.
You have someone in mind?
Maybe.
Won't you tell me who?
Listen, I was in the sun all day.
I feel woozy.
I'll tell you, but be patient.
Fine.
I like you, Galinette.
Just one more thing.
In choosing a wife, think of the children.
What do you mean?
Don't be enticed by a pretty face.
What we need is wide hips, long legs... and nice, big tits.
It's like choosing a brood mare.
What if she's also pretty?
If it's also, I won't mind.
On the contrary... she'd be the Soubeyran beauty.
I'd enjoy looking at her.
Over here, Noe!
Come!
Why is it always my turn?
The water is for everyone.
Cleaning the basin twice a year won't kill you.
This red sand and the dead leaves.
People need clean water.
So do vegetables.
This is strange.
Looks like clay, but it's not.
No... it's bauxite powder.
A mixture of iron and aluminum.
Where does it come from?
From the spring, after big storms.
It settles here... and never reaches the fountain.
After a rainy night... my spring water turns red and the stones look rusty.
It is rust, since it's iron oxide.
Then it can't hurt.
No.
It's actually good.
Where's your spring in relation to this basin?
What do you mean?
Is it higher up or below?
That's hard to say.
The Romarins valley is above here.
Then the village water comes from the same valley.
It's ten o'clock.
I promised they'd have water by noon!
That's two hours away.
But it takes an hour before it reaches the village.
I enjoy your company, but I must report to the mayor.
Don't keep him waiting, teacher.
Someone's throwing stones!
Wasn't that lightning?
You saw lightning?
You must have started drinking real early.
I swear I drank only coffee this morning.
That's my knife.
I lost it a few days ago.
- Around here?
- No.
I haven't been here before.
That's strange.
The shepherdess returned it to you.
- Where is she?
- What shepherdess?
- You mean Manon?
- The hunchback's Manon.
Who else?
Is she hiding here?
No, she ran away.
Too bad.
I wanted to thank her.
Some other time.
Thank her with a little kiss.
I don't know her, but I dreamt about her.
In my dream, I even kissed her.
Did she let you?
In my dreams, women don't resist me.
Aren't you eating?
I'm not hungry.
You haven't looked well lately.
I've lost my appetite.
Probably from that poison.
What poison?
The one I spray on my carnations... to kill the red spiders.
I'll do it for you.
No.
It has to be done at night.
Daylight is no good for it.
It weakens it.
It kills its effectiveness.
You work nights, but you don't sleep days.
You're never home.
What do you do all day?
I hunt.
I walk around on the hill.
I breathe in the fresh air... to clean out my lungs...
- from that poison.
- That's true.
It's good for the carnations, but bad for you.
Still, you should eat and sleep.
Want a doctor?
No.
I'll be all right.
See?
I'm eating.
She's going to Aubagne to sell my birds.
He's nuts.
Who is it?
It's me!
Yes, you're going crazy.
- Who is the woman?
- What woman?
The one you visit in Aubagne.
I've watched you for days.
You keep collecting birds.
What for?
I see you prancing and talking to yourself as if you're crazy!
Are you in love?
That's a good sickness.
Who is she?
You won't tell me.
Then she's either a tramp... or she's married.
That's it!
She's married!
She's married!
Open up!
No, I won't!
- We can talk through the door.
- Why?
If I don't see you, I might tell you.
You're as dopey as your poor mother.
Now, tell me.
I don't want to tell you anything.
Ask me questions.
Tell me who she is.
I won't tell you that.
A city girl?
Quite the opposite.
Even better.
Do I know her?
Actually, no.
What does that mean?
You're too clever.
After four questions, you'll know.
- Then...
I do know her.
- See?
I don't want to tell you.
You act like a cop, but I won't tell you.
Why not?
Because!
It's my secret.
My first love secret, and I'm keeping it.
Keep it.
I'm leaving.
Good-bye.
No!
Stay!
I want to talk about her.
I don't even know who she is.
But I do, so I like talking about her.
Papet, did you leave?
No.
I'm rolling a cigarette.
So, you want to marry her?
Yes, but she won't want me.
- Why?
- She's pretty and I'm ugly.
Does she have money?
Not much.
- Is she healthy?
- Yes.
She's strong as a horse and has good little muscles.
She would do a better job on my carnations than me.
And she's educated too.
How do you know?
She's always reading books.
Sometimes for a whole hour.
That's no good.
A poor girl who reads books.
I don't like it.
Besides, a beautiful wife could mean trouble.
Is she honest?
She's the Holy Virgin of the hills.
If she'd marry me, I'd be happy as a king.
But she won't.
No poor girl ever rejected a Soubeyran.
Unless she's crazy.
If she said yes, would you consent?
I can't say until I know who she is.
You idiot!
Open up and tell me!
I won't open the door!
I have to think!
Papet...
I may tell you, but first, swear by all the Soubeyrans... that when you hear her name, you won't say a word.
- As you like.
- No!
Swear it!
I swear it by all the Soubeyrans.
Good!
Now I have to decide.
I won't open the door.
I'll take out the key.
Put your ear next to the keyhole.
It's Manon, the hunchback's daughter.
Twenty years from now, you'll be too old for her.
- She'll have lovers.
- She wouldn't do that.
She's like all the others.
But never mind.
By then you'll have a house full of sturdy little Soubeyrans.
Since she's pretty, I give my consent.
You've seen her?
Yes, I have.
What's your opinion?
She's very pretty.
She seems mature for her age.
She must be 18 by now.
Know who she's like?
Nobody.
She looks like someone you never knew.
She looks exactly like her grandmother.
You knew her grandmother?
Florette Camoins... the beauty!
Miss, I'm glad to meet you... to thank you for my knife.
How did you know it was mine?
I saw you eating with it one day.
I'm the new teacher.
I'm collecting minerals in the hills... to teach my pupils the composition of their land.
There's no gold here.
It's Jurassic cretaceous from the second Quaternary era.
You're well-informed for a shepherdess.
I'm just quoting my dad.
I'd like you to keep this.
I've got one.
That one's too fancy for me.
No.
A shepherdess should have a shepherd's knife.
It has four blades, an awl and a nail file.
And small scissors.
I know, because I used them.
It's the first one I snared.
It's a baby.
The big ones get away.
That hare is my present to you.
My class starts soon.
I have to leave.
I'll leave this on a rock.
Someone is bound to find it.
She doesn't want your knife.
I'll keep it if you take the hare.
All right.
Thanks.
Papet...
How does one talk to girls?
I don't know any words of love.
So you've made up your mind?
Yes, I must hurry.
She could meet a man in Aubagne who might take her from me.
Where will you court her?
In the hills.
I'll pretend to look for mushrooms or snails... as if I didn't see her.
Not so fast.
If you're looking for mushrooms or snails... it makes you seem poor.
If you're rich, show it.
Don't wear your old clothes.
Wear a new suit, a real hunting outfit... with leather leggins and a matching hat.
And above all... wear suspenders.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a hare I shot that must be wounded.
Aren't you Manon, the daughter of Monsieur Jean?
I see you don't remember me.
That's because I've changed a lot.
I'm Ugolin... your poor father's friend.
You've changed too.
You're a real young lady.
I hardly recognize you.
You may wonder why we never met before.
I'm too busy to hunt because of my carnations.
Did you know I grow carnations?
I've been very successful.
I've earned lots of money.
The money's all in gold coins!
In two years, with my savings, I'll be worth 50,000 francs.
Would you like to move back to Romarins?
I'd stay in my Massacan house... and you and Baptistina can tend my carnations.
Manon, listen to me!
I know why you don't want to!
It's because you're proud.
But your pride is no problem.
Carnations need watering, picking, and women know all about that.
I'll pay you!
I'll pay you very well!
It isn't to have you work.
I was lying.
It's because I love you.
I love you with all my heart.
Manon!
I want to marry you!
I'm all alone.
I have no one!
My grandparents are dead!
My father hanged himself.
My mother died of the flu!
There's only Uncle Papet!
He's rich.
He's old!
He's going to die!
He'll leave it all to me, and it'll be yours!
Because I love you!
I love you!
My love for you is choking me... making me ill.
I saw you bathing in the water holes.
I watched for hours, you were so beautiful.
I was afraid I'd commit a crime!
- You spoke to her?
- I didn't see her.
She must have gone to Aubagne.
Then do it tomorrow.
Maybe.
First I've got to get used to this outfit.
You look great!
Like a hunter from Marseilles.
Look!
Do you see what I see?
A beautiful thrush.
That trap must belong to the hunchback's daughter.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
That is her herd.
She must be around here.
I won't touch it.
Other people's traps are sacred.
Especially hers.
That's her only livelihood.
She sells them at the Aubagne market.
She's proud.
We've already hurt her enough.
We didn't mean to.
We're not responsible.
We're all responsible.
We knew there was a spring at Romarins, but we said nothing.
Why didn't you speak up?
Because of Amelie.
- You want a bite?
- I sure do.
When I used to hunt at Romarins, I'd see... that poor hunchback look for water with his rod.
Once he was right above it, but the rod didn't bend.
Then he dug in the wrong spot.
That night I was upset... so I told Amelie.
What a scene!
She flew into a rage!
It was none of our business...
hunchbacks are bad luck... he was an outsider from Crespin, etc., etc.
You know how she is.
She made me swear to say nothing.
- So you didn't?
- No.
Ugolin and Papet are real bastards.
In that whole business, we were all bastards.
Papet!
My spring stopped running!
- What?
- No water!
None at all!
I dug down deep.
Not a drop!
Now what?
The carnations are budding!
- 15,000 of them.
- The well!
The well will be empty in two days.
Springs are capricious, especially yours.
- Give it three months.
- Three months!
Holy Mother!
Stop it, you fool!
The water is probably back by now.
And if not, with a few mules, we can hold out.
Let's take a look.
It used to flow.
When the hunchback came, it stopped.
Listen!
Something's wrong with our fountain.
It's just trickling.
Come and see!
That's not possible.
Here too!
Papet, we're ruined!
Calm down!
You see?
Could be a frog or a snake inside.
We're stuck, like Ugolin.
Impossible!
It hasn't stopped running in 50 years.
I'll go check out the basin.
Nothing!
I'm on my way.
Don't worry!
Monsieur Jean, have mercy.
You're up in heaven, so you can see... that my feet are so swollen that I can't wear shoes... that my mule is half-dead.
If this goes on, my carnations are ruined in eight days.
Come on.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost... give us back your daughter's spring.
Amen.
Help us!
Amen, damn it!
Yes, I'm the mayor.
When will you get here?
Tomorrow?
We'll all be dead!
He must come right away!
We have no bread.
Our crops are ruined.
It's a disaster!
Then I'll expect him tomorrow at the town hall.
The expert is coming tomorrow.
- What expert?
- The one I keep asking for!
The rural engineering expert.
The meeting will come to order.
This council meeting concerns the water problem.
Problem?
It's a disaster!
That's right, a disaster.
But thanks to my own efforts and my telephone...
I was able to get us a rural expert.
And here is the rural expert.
Gentlemen...
I have studied your problem... and here's the report I'm submitting to my chief.
Partridge Spring that fed your fountain... was the main source for this whole region.
It originated from a fissure between two layers of limestone.
The source is not diaclastic.
It is a Vauclusian resurgence.
Let's not confuse the two.
Thus, the water bed between two impervious strata leveled out... and the water issued forth along the upper stratum, under pressure.
This trapped pool supplied your basin by rising up... and the basin supplied your fountain through a series of pipes.
Yes, it's serious!
At the request of your mayor... and the administration... we researched the cause of this terrible accident.
First, where did your water originate?
Luckily we have this document.
Very interesting!
It's a study by the chief engineer... that spells out, clearly and to the point... some experiments made in this region five years ago.
Unfortunately, your spring does not appear on this valuable map... because it's not in the orography of the Huveaune River... or its tributaries.
Where does that leave us?
Since the water doesn't originate locally, it comes from far away.
I want to speak.
- Not now!
- I'll make it short!
Just let him turn on the water!
He can explain later!
I don't fix fountains.
The first theory is the drought.
A small drop in the ground water level may have caused your problem.
As the rising water is diverted by the parallel series of dolomites... and finally the Jurassic pattern... it should get through via a network of syphons.
You know what that is?
It's a rubber tube to draw wine.
Exactly.
At the first rain, the syphons are re-primed... as soon as the underground lake rises to its normal level.
An underground lake?
Of course!
And don't argue with progress.
You could be wrong.
If progress returns me my water, I'm for it!
And if my spring flows again, here's my 100 francs for progress!
Wait and hear the rest of this bullshit.
Now, the second theory.
The underground stream dropped into a network of caves.
Once they're filled... the water returns to its old level and the spring flows again.
How soon?
I can't tell you how long it might take.
Maybe two days... maybe two years.
Maybe 100 years.
That can't be ruled out.
Third theory...
To hell with your theories!
What can you do for us right now?
The administration will provide a daily truck with 1,300 gallons of water.
To cover your immediate daily needs.
How much water do I get for my carnations?
If our water hasn't returned in a month, what then?
We suggest you farm some land elsewhere.
What can I say?
Lots of villages have plenty of water.
No, sir... our council can't accept that!
Your council's power over natural phenomena is next to zero.
The third theory...
To hell with their theories!
We've got some administration!
And I say to hell with you!
You'll have to manage with the water truck.
It will be here in two days.
Meanwhile, gentlemen, good-bye!
Quiet!
Or else they'll send the police!
Where is he?
Where's the president of the Water Syndicate?
Who is the president?
It's not me, it's you!
I am because I'm the mayor, and that's because I have a phone!
And what is this?
- Your receipt.
- Right.
Fifty-two francs, plus the stamp.
You took my money.
Now where's my water?
Before you came, the expert explained about the orography.
You have to understand orography.
I don't give a damn!
I paid and I want my water!
Listen, they're sending a water truck every day.
Bring your mule... and you'll get 40 gallons like the rest of us.
One:
I have no mule, just a donkey.
Two: 40 gallons will do for a cafe, not for a field.
Three:
I paid for spring water, not truck water!
I'm sure they'll send spring water.
Not from my spring!
I paid and I want my water!
Stop yelling!
It's exhausting us and it won't help!
Holy Mother!
My poor eggplants.
My 600 beefsteak tomato plants!
But everyone is affected.
It's a major disaster.
Major, hell!
I paid and I want my water!
The spring stopped running.
Where should we get water?
Who cares?
Just make it run from my pipe.
And you, mind your own business!
You're a councilman, but I didn't vote for you!
- I don't need your vote.
- You pain in the ass!
Where do you think you are?
Surrounded by water thieves!
Good morning.
Today is my birthday.
After Mass you're invited for a drink.
We don't control what day we're born.
My brothers, I am truly glad... to see you all gathered in our little church.
The whole parish is here... including a group of intellectuals... who normally observe Holy Mass on the terrace of a coffee house.
I won't name it.
It's our only coffee house.
I won't name them either.
You all know them.
This ought to fill them with shame... were it not for their cynicism.
With clasped hands and moist eyes... you're full of faith and repentance today.
But God knows you're here because your spring stopped running... and your prayers are merely pleas for your string beans... orations for your tomatoes, hallelujahs for your artichokes... hosannas for your squash!
I must speak seriously about the spring.
I keep asking myself the same question.
Why is it... that this water, so plentiful until now... has suddenly dried up in the hour of our need?
I once read a Greek tragedy about the city of Thebes... that was struck by a calamitous plague... because of crimes committed by its king.
So I ask myself...
"Is there a criminal among us?"
It's not impossible... since the biggest crimes often escape human justice.
But God knows of them all!
I'll now speak to this unknown criminal, if he exists.
To him I say...
"My brother... there's no sin that cannot be forgiven... no crime that can't be atoned for... by sincere repentance"
Our Lord, Jesus Christ, said this astounding phrase:
"There is more room in heaven for one repentant sinner."
Whatever your offense, try to make amends.
Repent, and you shall be saved.
And your spring will flow better than before.
Papet.
He knows.
He looked at me three times.
What could he know?
He's only been here a year.
Maybe somebody told him in confession.
Anglade might have.
He's such a bigot that he might confess other people's sins.
What worries me is the girl.
Me too.
She seemed unfriendly to you.
She seemed to be saying, "You're the criminal."
No.
She knows nothing either.
Then what worries you?
I think she doesn't want you.
To our teacher's good health!
Here's to you!
What did you think of the sermon?
What do you expect?
It's just a lot of words.
I'm sure no act of God dried up the spring.
He seemed to allude to a crime he knew of.
Maybe he heard of it in confession and couldn't reveal more.
What crime?
If anyone here commits a crime, we'd all know.
No, I felt he had someone in mind.
- Then who?
- Yes, who?
He kept looking at Ugolin.
Yes, especially when he spoke of the plague.
- I'm a plague?
- Don't joke about such things.
You smelled our Pernod!
I came because of the water, not the Pernod.
I have to speak to you.
It's very important.
- To me?
- Yes.
You can bring our water back.
I could?
How?
By coming to the procession.
Will you?
Then our fountain won't ever flow again.
You think she's a saint?
An orphan's prayer... soars to heaven like a lark.
Our Lord will gladly listen to her song.
She's innocent.
If she prays for us, we're saved.
Manon, you must save our carnations!
I won't help those who stole my father's water!
I don't understand.
They understand!
They know why God is punishing them.
Tell us.
Do you know who the criminal is?
There are two.
There they are!
If we're treated like criminals, I'd rather go home.
Come, Galinette.
Your hurried departure might make us think...
I don't care what you think!
I think for myself.
Let's go.
- Come on!
- No.
I want to hear what she's accusing me of... because I can solve the whole problem.
Tell me how they stole your father's water.
But she's imagining things!
It's true her father's lack of water may have ruined him.
He would have found water, except for his accidental death.
The two women were in trouble... so we bought the little farmland.
Partly because we liked it, true.
But also to help them out!
Later we searched for the spring and, by sheer luck, we found it.
That's what she calls stealing his water.
"Help thy neighbor." Some joke!
Let's go!
He's lying!
The truth is the spring was always there.
The truth is you blocked it off.
Why would they do that?
To buy it cheap.
Without water, the farm is worthless.
My father's dead, thanks to these assassins!
That's not true!
That's slander!
I found that spring with my watch.
You were there with your mother.
You held a squash.
Tell the truth!
Within less than an hour?
God said to Pascal:
"You wouldn't look for me... unless you'd already found me."
To hell with Pascal!
I only met him once.
He was so rude, I slapped him!
You laugh, but it's true.
Here's what we have.
She denies what she saw and believes what she didn't see.
Who saw us block up that spring?
Who saw us block up that spring?
Me.
I saw you.
I saw you both!
Liar!
What did you see, idiot?
You never knew left from right.
In the army, they put an "X" on his left hand.
He never understood, so they sent him home.
I planned it that way.
It wasn't easy, but it worked.
The major had his suspicions.
We're not interested in that.
Tell us what you saw.
He saw nothing.
- He was dreaming.
- I never dream!
It was nine or ten years ago.
See?
He's being vague.
It was after Bouffigue died.
It was at Romarins, hunting partridge.
They were drinking from a puddle near the empty farmhouse.
I picked the lock, went upstairs...
How nice!
Breaking into a dead man's house.
Bouffigue built two small windows under the gutter to shoot thrush.
First, I took a nap.
You see, he slept!
He was dreaming!
That was no dream!
Suddenly I heard digging sounds and woke up.
I watched through the window...
This one was digging.
The other watched.
I didn't dare move.
The water gushed out of the hole... then they blocked the spring with cement.
Why didn't you tell her father?
It wasn't my business.
But now God is punishing them and us.
Now it is my business.
Suppose he's telling the truth.
It's not true, but if it were...
I'm willing to give her the spring, my carnations... the farm, the money, the Soubeyran fortune... my life.
You know it.
I told you so in the hills.
I love you more than anything.
Listen.
Listen to me, Manon.
I see you and talk to you constantly.
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.
If you don't want me, I'll die or go crazy.
Shut up, idiot.
Let's go.
Just think about it.
What a terrible mixture... between my remorse... and the happiness I'd like to bring you.
Don't you know how I'll slave for you, my love?
Make him go away!
My love!
Don't be a fool.
Get up.
Think, Manon!
Just think.
I'll die over this love, and nobody'll care.
Galinette, come on home.
No!
It's all your fault!
I lost everything because of you!
If I had known...
Galinette, my boy!
I'll stay.
Since you're all against him, I'll defend him.
That won't be easy.
You all know there never was a spring at Romarins... just a puddle.
But I found the real spring!
Those of you who are natives like me... admit that there was no spring.
Listen carefully.
If you knew of a spring and didn't tell the hunchback... then you're responsible for his death.
The old bastard!
- You knew?
- Sure.
We all knew.
We didn't dare denounce them to defend an outsider.
He hated my grandmother.
They took it out on her son.
Who's your grandmother?
Florette.
They never forgave her for marrying a man from Crespin.
Florette was your grandmother?
The hunchback was Florette's son?
Papet wants to see you and the mayor.
He wants to see you too.
- Me?
- He said to hurry.
- He said you'll be glad.
- Where is he?
At Romarins.
What's wrong?
Put him on the table.
Right there.
Go tell the deaf one... to bring some candles from the church.
At least six big ones.
And the linen sheet his grandmother wove.
Pamphile, prepare the coffin.
You have the oak boards in the attic.
The ones I wanted for myself.
I know.
You're the one who ordered them.
Use them for him.
The rest of you, please... say he fell from a tree.
Keep this a secret... for three days... or the priest won't give him a proper burial.
Now you can leave.
I'm staying with you.
There's no need to.
She should have married him... and gotten her revenge by driving him crazy.
Papet, I'm leaving because I can't go on.
It's not the carnations.
It's because of my love.
I realize she'll never want me.
I suspected it because her ribbon burned my flesh.
And when I told her in public I wanted to marry her... she spat at me in a fury.
What's more, she fled towards the teacher.
When he talks to her, she lowers her eyes.
When he stops, she lingers until he continues.
And he takes her love for granted.
He's unaware of his happiness, but I know my misery.
I can't stand it.
I'd like to kill him.
But it would hurt her, and I'd never hurt her.
I leave her my farm and all that's hidden... you know where...
to the left of the fireplace.
Don't make any trouble.
It's not her fault or yours.
It's fate.
Arrange a Mass for me, because up there...
I'll have to explain about the spring.
Adieu, my Papet.
I'm sorry to leave you, but I can't stay.
You know?
I know.
What will you do?
I don't know.
I won't go back to that house.
Too many bad memories.
I'd keep seeing him hang where my swing used to be... and smell his odor in the house.
Will you join the procession?
If you're sure... that the water won't come back, you should go.
If your father could bring back the spring... what would he do?
He'd have liked to be their friend.
For his sake, do what he would have done.
You think this procession will help?
You never know.
I wonder how I would feel if the prayers worked.
I would feel forced to go to confession.
That's what worries me.
I know several fools who'd think like you... and I'd surely lose the elections.
Miracles can be very convincing.
Something's happening!
Stop!
It's breathing.
The pipe is blowing.
A miracle!
Kneel!
On your knees!
Kneel down, everybody!
It's not a miracle!
It's just a coincidence!
I recognized your footsteps.
Your ear is as sharp as an eye.
Ears can't replace eyes, Cesar.
Belly dancing is all very well... but you made a mistake when you were over there.
I did?
I said "mistake," but it was almost a crime.
I don't know what mistake you mean.
When I was wounded, they almost promoted me.
That's something else.
I'm talking about a letter you received.
What letter?
One that deserved an answer.
An answer that you never sent.
A letter from whom?
You don't want to tell me... because you think I don't know.
- I swear, Delphine!
- Don't swear, you sinner!
I'm sorry for reminding you of something unpleasant.
What is unpleasant?
From here I see the church... and a cross on top of the steeple.
I swear on that cross that I received no letter... except from my father and Anglade.
In that case, it's a tragedy.
Why?
Swear again that you're not lying to me.
I swear it.
Who wrote to me?
Florette.
Florette Camoins?
There was no other Florette.
Are you sure?
I, myself, gave the letter to the mailman.
I'd never have forgotten a letter from her.
I still have two faded notes she wrote to me... and a black comb from her hair.
It's true.
When I came back, she had left the village.
She was married to the blacksmith in Crespin... and she already had a child.
How could that letter have gotten lost?
Over there, we moved from place to place.
Sometimes our food and even our ammunition didn't reach us.
Some letters may have been lost too.
But if I had received that letter...
I would still know it by heart.
If that's true, it's dreadful.
You think she loved me?
You old fool.
She never told me so... not even after what happened between us one night... in Anglade's barn.
That's how she was.
In her letter... she told you that she was pregnant.
What?
Yes.
You had left three weeks before.
She told you if you wrote to her father... promising to marry her... she would wait for you.
She could have shown her letter to the whole village... and nobody would have dreamed of making fun of her.
Are you sure?
The poor girl couldn't sleep.
She tried to lose the baby with devilish potions.
She jumped from high rocks in the hills... but nothing worked.
Then she started hating you.
She went to the dance at Aubagne... where she found the blacksmith from Crespin.
So she left the village... and no one ever knew when the child was born.
Was it born alive?
Alive, yes... but it was a hunchback.
I hear Clarinette coming back.
Come on over, my girl.
It's getting chilly.
I'd rather sit by the fireplace.
Adieu, Cesar.
Don't worry.
I never told anyone.
I'm going to pray for you.
What's wrong, Papet?
Are you ill?
Don't stand here.
It's too cold.
Should I call a doctor?
I could call at the Ombres.
No, thanks.
I know what's wrong with me.
Lean on me.
I'll take you home.
My friend, I don't believe you are about to die.
But I believe I am.
I know I'll die tonight.
What makes you think so?
I'll die because I no longer want to live.
Hurry and confess me.
You'll see.
I have lots to confess.
You know that suicide is a mortal sin.
I won't need to kill myself.
I'll simply pass away.
Dear God, please don't let her baby be a hunchback.
Dear little Manon... the notary will tell you that I'm leaving you my whole estate.
It may surprise you, but it's the truth.
The notary will give you all the documents.
Because your father was my son.
He was the Soubeyran I'd hoped for all my life... whom I tormented to death... because I didn't know who he was.
If I had told him about the spring... he'd still be playing his harmonica... and you'd all be living in our family home.
No one knows it, but I'm too ashamed to face anyone... even the trees.
In the village, there's a person who knows.
She will tell you everything.
It's Delphine, the old blind woman.
She'll explain that it's all because of Africa.
I don't deserve to kiss you... and I never dared speak to you.
But maybe now you can forgive me... and even say a little prayer... for poor Ugolin and me.
I'm so pathetic, I even pity myself.
Out of sheer spite, I never went near him.
I never knew his voice or his face.
I never saw his eyes... that might have been like his mother's.
I only saw his hump and the pain I caused him.
Now you understand why I want to die.
Because next to my torments... even hell would be a pleasure.
Besides, I'll see him up there.
I'm not afraid of him.
Now he knows he's a Soubeyran... and it's not my fault that he's a hunchback.
He knows it was all a foolish mistake.
I'm sure that instead of blaming me... he'll defend me.
Farewell, my darling girl.
Your grandfather, Cesar Soubeyran.

Here.
Next time I won't pay this much.
The competition from Italy is ruining me.
This barely pays for fertiliser for the flowers.
Next year we'll grow chick peas.
I'd miss our aperitifs together.
What is it?
What are you barking at?
I'm not going to steal your goats.
Leave my bread alone!
Here, we'll share my lunch.
Hold on...
leave some for me!
- Hello, chaps!
- Hello.
What did you do today, Bernard?
I went for a walk in the hills.
Look what I found.
Lignite.
The hills are full of it.
Interesting.
- I saw some goats.
- It's the hunchback's girl's herd.
The little savage!
She's been hiding from us since her father died.
I've seen her.
She's a real beauty.
She must take after her mother.
For a hunchback, he had a lovely daughter.
Who was this hunchback?
You never met him, Mr Belloiseau.
You didn't live here then.
He was a city intellectual who wanted to be a farmer.
- He was a loony!
- I'm not so sure of it.
I'm not saying he was an idiot but he just wasn't practical.
He thought he could breed rabbits by doing sums on paper.
Only because there was no water at Romarins.
But you found some.
How's the flower trade?
Christmas and Shrove Tuesday are best, and Easter's pretty good, too.
How about deaths?
Not bad at all.
They bring in a certain amount.
Come along!
Quick!
Thank you.
There's a letter for you.
My darling,
Tonight we're playing Ai'da in Bordeaux.
I've only got a small part, but I'm so pleased.
If only you were with me, I'd be almost happy.
Your loving mother.
You can't stay here for ever.
You should be with your mother.
No hares, no rabbits, no birds...
Where have they got to?
Maybe I'm going deaf and blind.
Next time I'll bring a hound along.
That one won't get away.
Galinette!
Do you know it's five o'clock?
That was some nap!
I think I must have caught the sun.
No, you're not red.
You must be short of sleep.
Come on out.
She may be deaf, but she guesses everything.
What I've got to say is just between the two of us.
Galinette, you're past thirty, and you're the last of the Soubeyrans.
I know all that...
Don't interrupt!
If I'm repeating myself, that's your fault.
I'll talk till you understand.
We Soubeyrans were the most important family of this region.
- On Grandpa's birthday...
- There were more than 30 guests.
All of them Soubeyrans, with pots of gold hidden about the place.
We were respected.
Well, things have changed.
That's fate.
No!
Fate doesn't exist.
What happened to us is the fault of our elders.
They were proud and wanted to hold on to their money.
Cousins married cousins.
One uncle married his niece.
It's just as bad for men as for rabbits.
And what was the result?
Two madwomen and three suicides.
Now, it's just us.
It's too late for me, so it's all up to you.
You're telling me to get married.
Why didn't you?
I wasn't cut out for it.
Mind you, I almost did...
It didn't work out.
I joined up on an impulse and went to Africa.
When I came back...
If she'd given me a child, I'd have married her like a shot.
But it didn't happen.
I'm like Anglade's cherry trees:
lots of flowers, but no fruit.
- So I'm to marry instead of you?
- You've got to, Galinette.
But why should I?
Why?
You ask me why!
Isn't the Soubeyran fortune reason enough?
This isn't paper money we're talking about.
It's gold!
Pots full of gold coins.
Do you understand?
I own a fortune!
The fruit of saving, skimping and hard work.
- Do you want to chuck it all away?
- Of course not!
I love gold.
If you love it, you can't deprive it of a loving owner!
Papet, I can't make a family just like that!
- I've been telling you to for years!
- Now that you're more serious,
I'd rather make up my own mind.
Have you got your eye on someone?
Maybe.
Can't you tell me who?
Look, I've been out in the sun all day and I feel a bit dazed.
I will tell you, but not yet.
Fine.
You're a good boy, Galinette.
But one thing more...
When choosing a wife, think of the children.
What do you mean?
Don't get stuck on a pretty face.
We need a girl with wide hips, long legs and big tits!
Think of her as a brood mare.
What if she's pretty besides?
If it's besides, I won't object...
On the contrary.
I'd enjoy looking at a pretty Soubeyran.
Come on!
Over here, Noe!
Come on!
We do all the work even though everyone uses the water.
Cleaning the tank twice a year won't kill you!
What with this sand, if we want clean drinking water...
Better for vegetables, too.
It's not sticky.
It looks like clay, but it's not clay.
It's bauxite powder.
A mixture of iron and aluminium.
I wonder where it's from.
The spring deposits it here after big storms, but it doesn't reach the village.
The morning after a rainy night, my spring water's the colour of rust.
It is rust: it's iron oxide.
- Then it's not harmful.
- No, it's beneficial.
Where is your spring in relation to this tank?
What do you mean?
Is it higher up or lower down?
It's hard to say.
I think the Romarins spring is higher up.
The village water must come from here and follow the same course.
- It's ten o'clock.
- I said I'd have the water on by noon!
That's two hours away.
But it takes an hour for it to reach the village.
Much though I enjoy your company, I have to see the mayor.
Don't keep him waiting!
Hey!
Someone's throwing stones!
I saw a flash of lightning!
At ten o'clock?
You must have started drinking early.
I swear I've had only a coffee!
It's my knife.
I lost it in the hills a few days ago.
- Around here?
- No.
I've never been here before.
- That's very odd.
- It's a gift from the goatherd.
- Which goatherd?
Do you mean Manon?
- Yes, the hunchback's kid.
Who else?
- Is she hiding up there?
- She'll have run away.
Too bad!
I'd like to thank her.
- Some other time!
- Thank her with a little kiss.
It's odd.
After all that talk, I dreamt about her the other night.
- In my dream, I kissed her.
- Did she let you?
In my dreams women rarely resist me.
- Aren't you eating?
- I'm not hungry.
You haven't looked well lately.
I've lost my appetite.
It's probably the poison.
What poison?
The one I spray on my carnations to kill the spiders.
- I'll do it for you.
- No.
You have to use it at night.
Sunlight does it no good.
It makes it less potent.
Daylight destroys its effectiveness.
You work at night, but don't sleep days.
You're never home.
What do you do with yourself all day long?
I go hunting and wander about the hills.
I breathe fresh air.
I need to clear my lungs of the poison.
True.
It's good for the carnations but bad for you.
You've got to eat and sleep.
- Do you want to see the doctor?
- No, I'll be all right.
See?
I'm eating.
She's going to Aubagne to sell my birds.
He's going mad!
- Who is it?
- Me!
- I know that!
Who's the woman?
- What woman?
The one you've been following to Aubagne.
I've been watching you.
And what about those birds you've been catching?
Are you going mad, or what?
Are you in love?
That's a great illness!
So who is she?
If you won't tell me, she can't be altogether nice... or else she's married.
Yes, yes, that's it!
She's married.
She's married!
- Open up, imbecile!
- No, I won't!
- We can talk through the door.
- Why?
If I can't see you, I might tell you something.
You're as mad as your poor father.
What do you want to tell me?
I don't want to, but you're insisting, so ask away!
Tell me who she is!
No, I won't!
- A city girl?
- On the contrary!
Good!
Do I know her?
- Not really.
- What do you mean?
You're bound to guess who it is.
So I know her?
See?
You know I don't want to tell you, but you insist on interrogating me.
- Well, I won't answer.
- Why not?
Because...
Because it's my secret.
My first secret love.
In that case, I'm going.
Bye!
No, stay here!
I want to talk about her.
- I don't even know who she is.
- But I do!
Papet, are you going?
No, I'm rolling a cigarette.
So, you want to marry her?
Yes, but she won't have me.
- Why not?
- She's pretty and I'm ugly.
Has she got money?
Not much.
Is she healthy?
Yes, she's as strong as a horse.
She's got good muscles.
She could do a good job on my carnations.
- And she's educated.
- How do you know?
She reads books for hours at a time.
That sounds bad.
I'm wary of a poor girl who reads books.
Besides, a beautiful wife may be fickle.
Is she virtuous?
Wild and pure as the driven snow.
She'd be a wonderful wife.
I'd be happy as a king but she wouldn't want me.
No poor girl would reject a Soubeyran... unless she's mad.
If she said yes, would you consent?
I can't until I know who she is.
Come on, you fool!
Open up and tell me!
No!
I can't open the door!
I've got to think.
- Papet...
- Yes?
I'll tell you, but you must swear on the family name that when you hear her name you won't say a word.
- As you like.
- No!
Swear to me!
I swear on the name of the Soubeyrans.
Good.
Now I've got to decide.
I'm not opening the door;
I'm just taking out the key.
Put your ear next to the keyhole.
It's Manon, the hunchback's daughter.
In 20 years' time, she'll think you too old for her and she might be unfaithful.
Not a girl like her.
She's just like the rest of them.
But never mind.
By then you'll have your family of sturdy Soubeyrans.
She's lovely.
You have my consent.
- Have you seen her?
- Yes, I have.
- What do you think?
- I told you.
She's lovely.
She seems mature for her age.
She looks at least 18.
- Do you know who she looks like?
- Nobody.
Yes, she does.
She looks like someone you never knew.
- Her grandmother.
- Did you know her?
Florette Camoins.
The great beauty.
I'm glad to meet you at last.
I wanted to thank you for my knife.
- How did you know it was mine?
- I saw you eating with it the other day.
I'm the new teacher.
I'm making a collection of local rocks so I can teach my pupils about their land.
I thought you were a gold-digger.
It's all cretaceous, from the Quaternary era.
You know a lot for a country girl.
My father taught me.
- I'd like you to keep this.
- I've got one.
- That one's too fancy for me.
- It's not!
Why shouldn't a goatherd have a good knife?
It's got four blades and a nail file.
And some scissors.
I know.
I used them.
It's the first one I've trapped.
It's a baby.
The hawks eat the big ones.
That hare's my offering to you.
My class begins soon.
I've got to go.
I'll leave this on a rock.
Someone will be glad to find it.
She doesn't want your knife.
- I'll keep it if you take the hare.
- Fine.
Thanks.
- Papet...
- Yes.
What's the best way to talk to girls?
I don't know how to talk about love.
So, you've made up your mind?
Yes.
I'd better hurry because she often goes to Aubagne and she might meet a man who'll take her from me.
- Where will you talk to her?
- In the hills.
I'll pretend I'm gathering snails and didn't see her.
Hang on!
If you do that, it'll look as if you're poor.
Show your wealth!
Don't wear your old clothes.
You should wear a new suit, a hunting outfit with leather leggings and a hat to match.
And most important of all...
Wear braces!
Excuse me...
I'm looking for a hare I shot which must be wounded.
Aren't you Manon, the daughter of poor Monsieur Jean?
I see you don't remember me.
That's because I've changed a lot.
I'm Ugolin, your poor father's friend.
You've changed, too.
You're a proper little lady.
I barely recognised you.
Perhaps you're wondering why we haven't met before.
I don't have time to hunt any more because of my carnations.
Did you know I grew carnations?
I've been very successful.
I've made lots of money.
The money's all in gold coins!
With my savings, I'll be worth 50,000 francs in two years.
Would you like to move back to Romarins?
I could stay in my house in Massacan and you could tend to my flowers.
Manon, listen to me!
I know why you don't want to.
It's because you're proud.
But your pride's no problem.
Carnations must be watered and picked.
A woman will do that well.
I'll pay you.
You'll be well paid.
It's not to give you work.
I was lying.
It's because I love you.
I love you with all my heart!
Manon!
I want to marry you!
I'm all alone!
I've got no-one!
My grandparents are dead.
My father hanged himself when I was little.
My mother died of the flu.
There's only Uncle Papet!
He's rich, he's old.
He's going to die.
He's going to leave me all his money.
It'll be yours, because I love you!
I love you!
I am sick for the love of you.
It's suffocating me!
I saw you bathing in the rainwater.
I watched for hours.
You were so lovely.
I was tempted to commit a crime.
- Did you talk to her?
- I didn't see her.
- She must have gone to Aubagne.
- Then do it tomorrow.
Maybe.
I have to get used to this outfit.
You look great!
Like a hunter from Marseilles.
- Look!
See that?
- A nice little thrush.
- That girl must have trapped it.
- Really?
Yes.
See?
There's her herd.
She can't be far off.
I always respect other people's traps.
And it's this poor girl's only livelihood.
I've seen her selling birds in Aubagne.
- We've done her enough harm already.
- Not on purpose.
It wasn't our fault.
It was.
We all knew there was a spring at Romarins but no-one said anything.
- So why didn't you tell him?
- Because of Amelie.
- Shall we eat?
- Let's.
I used to go hunting over there and see that poor hunchback dowsing for water.
Once, he was right above it but the rod didn't move.
Later, I saw him digging in the wrong place and it kept on bothering me.
I told Amelie and she flew into such a rage.
It was none of our business.
Hunchbacks are bad luck.
He was an outsider, from Crespin, etc, etc.
You know what she's like.
She made me swear to say nothing.
- So you didn't?
- No.
- Ugolin and Papet were real bastards.
- On that score, we were all bastards.
- Papet, my spring's dried up!
- What?
- No water.
- None at all?
No.
I dug a deep hole.
Not a drop.
- My carnations are budding.
- 1 5,000 of them.
- There's your tank.
- In two days, it'll be empty.
Springs are capricious.
I bet it'll flow again in three months.
Three months!
Oh, Lord!
Stop it, you fool!
Get up!
It's probably already flowing again.
If not, we can transport enough water using a few mules.
It used to flow.
When the hunchback came, it stopped...
Hey!
There's something wrong with the fountain.
- Come and see.
- Impossible!
- Not here, too?
We're ruined!
- Calm down!
Well?
There must be a frog blocking the pipe.
We're stuck, like Ugolin.
Impossible!
It's flowed for 50 years.
Let's check the tank.
Nothing.
- Right.
I'm off.
- Don't worry.
Monsieur Jean, you're a good man and you're up in heaven.
You can see that my feet are so swollen I can hardly walk, that my mule's half dead.
If this continues, my carnations will be ruined.
Please, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, give us back your daughter's spring.
Amen.
Help us!
Amen, damn it!
Hello?
Yes, I'm the mayor.
How soon can he get here?
Tomorrow?
We'll be dead by then!
We need him now.
We've got no bread.
Our crops are ruined.
It's a catastrophe.
Then I'll expect him at seven at the public hall.
Thank you.
- The expert will be here tomorrow.
- What expert?
The Rural Engineering expert I've been asking for.
I declare the meeting open.
We're meeting to discuss the problem of water.
- It's not a problem: it's a disaster!
- Quite right.
But thanks to my personal initiative and my phone, the local authority has sent us expert help.
This is the expert.
Gentlemen, I've studied your problem, and this is what I shall report to the Chief Engineer.
The Perdrix spring which supplied your fountain is the main source of water for this whole region.
It runs between two layers of limestone.
The spring is not diaclistic, but a Vauclusian resurgence.
Let's not forget that, eh?
Thus, the water flowed between two impervious strata, pressing against the upper layer.
The pressure generated forced water into the tank.
Gravity then ensured the flow of water from the tank to the village.
Right.
Gravity.
At the request of your mayor and with local authority permission, we have examined the cause of the present obstruction.
First, where is the source of the water?
I have here a useful document...
It's an analysis by the Chief Engineer clearly stating the results of experiments made in the region some five years ago.
Sadly, there's no indication whatever of a spring in this area.
There's no stream within the orography of the Huveaune river.
What does that mean?
The source of your water is some way away.
- I want to speak.
- This isn't the time.
I'll make it short.
Just let him turn on the water.
He can explain later.
I'm not a plumber.
Now, the first hypothesis is drought.
The trouble may be due to a drop in the water table.
The watercourse is determined by seams of dolomite in the limestone.
It can cross the seams via a network of siphons.
You know what that is?
You use them in winemaking.
Precisely.
During the rainy season, the siphons are reactivated as soon as the water table rises to its normal level.
What table?
Quiet!
To oppose progress is a sure sign of ignorance!
If progress turns my water on, I'm all for it, and, if my spring flows again, here's my 100 francs for progress.
Let's hear the rest... the rest of his rubbish.
Now, the second hypothesis.
The subterranean stream drops into a network of cavities.
Once they're full, the water rises and the spring will flow again.
- How soon?
- I really couldn't say.
Perhaps in two days, perhaps in two years.
Or a hundred years!
That's not to be ruled out.
Third hypothesis...
To hell with your theories!
What can you do for us right now?
The administration can provide a daily truck with 1 ,300 gallons of water.
That should cover your daily needs.
How much do I get for my flowers?
If we've got no water by next month, what'll you do?
We'd suggest you farm the land elsewhere.
There's no lack of villages where water is plentiful.
Our council can never accept that!
Your council's influence on natural phenomena is next to zero.
- The third hypothesis...
- To hell with their hypo-thingies!
The administration's just a waste of time!
In that case, the administration says you can go to hell!
The water truck will be here in two days.
Meanwhile, gentlemen, I wish you good luck.
Where is he?
Where's the head of the Water Board?
I'm not the head of the Water Board:
you are!
Only because I'm the mayor and I've got a phone.
- See this?
What's this?
- It's your receipt.
Right. 52 francs plus the stamp.
So, where's the water I paid for?
The expert explained it's the orography.
That's the whole problem.
I don't give a damn!
I paid for my water and I want it.
Listen...
They'll send a lorry of water daily.
Just bring your mule and you'll get 40 gallons of water like the rest of us.
One:
I haven't got a mule, only a donkey.
Two: 40 gallons are enough for a cafe but not my field.
Three:
I paid for spring water, not truck water.
- The truck water must be spring water.
- Not from my spring!
I want my water.
Stop yelling.
You're driving us mad.
What about my aubergines?
And my tomatoes are just ripening.
It's the same for everyone.
Damn that!
I've paid and I want my water.
The spring's dry.
How can we get water?
I don't care, as long as I get mine back.
And you - mind your own business!
You may be a councillor but I didn't vote for you.
Who cares about your vote?
- Why us?
Who do you think we are?
- Water thieves!
Stop!
Stop it!
Good morning.
Today's my birthday and I'd like to invite you over for a drink after Mass.
I had no say over my birth date.
Dearly beloved, I am truly happy to see you all gathered in our little church.
The whole parish is here, including some clever folks - too clever, perhaps - who generally ignore Mass and hang around in the cafe.
I won't name it - it's our only cafe - or name them, since everyone's staring at them already.
I hope this shames them, rather than making them laugh.
Your hands are joined, your eyes moist.
Today you are all steeped in faith.
But God knows that your piety is due to your spring and that your prayers are merely pleas for your beans, orisons for your tomatoes, hallelujahs for your potatoes, and hosannas for your marrows!
Now, I must speak seriously about the spring.
I keep asking myself the question:
Why has this water, once so plentiful, suddenly dried up in our hour of need?
I once read in a Greek tragedy, a profane work of literature, that Thebes was struck by a calamitous plague because its king had committed some crimes.
And so I ask myself:
Is there a criminal among us?
It's quite possible, since many wicked crimes escape the justice of men, but the Good Lord knows all about them!
So, if this criminal does exist, let me now appeal to him.
Let me say to him:
My brother, there's no sin that cannot be forgiven, no crime that can't be atoned for by the most sincere repentance.
According to Jesus Christ himself, there will always be room in heaven for a repentant sinner.
So, whatever your offence, try to redeem yourself.
Repent and you shall be saved!
And our spring will flow again as before.
- Papet!
- Yes?
He meant us.
He looked at me three times.
What could he know?
He's only been here for a year.
Maybe somebody told him in confession.
It's possible Anglade did it.
He's so self-righteous that he's liable to confess other people's sins.
- I'm worried about the girl.
- So am I.
She seemed hostile to you.
She looked at me twice, as if to say "You're the criminal".
- No, she knows nothing.
- Then why are you worried?
I don't think she wants you.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
Here's to our teacher's good health.
Here's to you!
- What did you think of that sermon?
- Nothing.
It's just a lot of talk.
I can't believe the spring dried up through an act of God.
He implied it was a criminal act.
He probably learnt about it through someone's confession.
What crime?
If someone here was guilty, we'd all know about it.
I'm sure he had someone in mind.
- Who?
- Yes, who?
- He looked at Ugolin a lot.
- Especially when he mentioned plague.
- I haven't got the plague!
- You shouldn't joke about such things.
- You smelled the Pernod!
- No, I came on account of the water.
- I've got something important to say.
- To me?
Yes.
You can bring our water back.
How can l?
By coming to the procession.
Will you?
If you refuse, our fountain will never flow again.
She's not a saint!
An orphan's prayer soars heavenwards like a lark.
Our Lord will listen to her.
She's innocent.
If she prays for us, we're saved.
Manon, you must come and save our flowers!
I won't pray for people who robbed my father.
I don't understand you.
They do.
They know why God is punishing them.
Do you know who the criminal is?
There are two of them.
Them.
I've had enough of this nonsense.
I'm going home.
Come on, Galinette.
- Your reaction might arouse suspicion...
- I don't care what you suspect.
My conscience is clear.
Let's go home!
- Come on!
- No.
I want to hear what she's got against me.
I can settle the whole matter.
- How did they steal your father's water?
- She's imagining things.
It's true that her father's lack of water ruined him.
But for his fatal accident, he might have found it.
Since the two women were in trouble, we bought the farmstead...
Partly because we liked it - that's true - but partly, too, to help them out.
Later on, purely by chance, we found the spring.
She calls that stealing her water.
Help thy neighbour - some joke!
Let's go.
It's not true!
He's lying!
He knew that spring was on our land.
What really happened is that you deliberately blocked it up.
- Why would they do that?
- To buy it cheap.
The dry land was worthless.
- Those two murdered my father!
- That's not true!
It's slander!
I found that spring with my watch.
You and your mother saw me looking for it.
- Tell the truth!
- In less than one hour?
God said to Pascal:
"You wouldn't look for me unless you'd already found me."
To hell with Pascal!
I only met him once.
He was so rude I slapped him.
You laugh, but it's true!
She denies what she saw, but she believes what she didn't see.
Who saw us block that spring?
You see!
Who saw us block it up?
I saw you.
Both of you.
Liar!
What did you see?
You don't know left from right!
In the army, he failed every test.
He was so stupid they sent him home.
That was exactly what I wanted.
It wasn't easy, but I got away with it...
Never mind that.
Tell us what you saw.
He saw nothing.
He dreamt it.
I never dream.
It was nine or ten years ago.
- See how vague he is?
- Just after Bouffigue died.
I was hunting at Romarins.
The partridges were drinking from a puddle near the empty farm, so I went inside.
Charming behaviour!
Stealing from a dead man's house!
It was so I could shoot the partridges from an upstairs window.
- First, I snoozed for a while.
- I knew it: he was dreaming.
I wasn't dreaming!
Suddenly, there was the sound of digging and it woke me up.
I saw them from the window - one digging and the other looking on.
I didn't dare move.
I saw the water gush out and then I saw them block the spring.
Why didn't you tell her father?
It was none of my business, but now we're all being punished it is my business.
Suppose that what he's said is true...
It's not, but let's just suppose it is...
You know I'd give her everything:
the spring, my flowers, my house, my money, the Soubeyran fortune and my life.
You know that.
I told you so in the hills.
I love you unbearably.
Listen...
Please listen, Manon.
Ever since I saw you, ever since I spoke to you, food has been turning to sawdust in my mouth, sleep's been a torment...
If you reject me, I'll die or go mad.
Shut up, you fool.
Let's go.
Just think how I feel.
I'm all mixed up, what with remorse for the harm I've done you and the happiness I want to offer you.
You must know how I'd slave for you!
- Oh, my love!
- Make him go away!
Don't be a fool!
Stand up!
Manon, you must realise, I'm going to die for the love of you, and no-one cares!
Galinette, come home!
No!
It's all your fault!
I've lost everything because of you.
If only I'd known.
Galinette, my boy!
I'm staying.
Since you're all against him, I'll defend him.
I don't see how you can.
You all know there was no spring at Romarins - just a puddle.
But I found the real spring.
You men, you're natives like me:
tell him there was no spring.
Listen: anyone who knew there was one and didn't tell the hunchback is responsible for his death.
- The old bastard!
- You knew!
Of course.
We all knew.
But we didn't dare denounce them to protect an outsider.
They hated my grandmother and wanted revenge.
Who's your grandmother?
Florette.
It's because she married a man from Crespin.
Florette was your grandmother?
Then the hunchback was Florette's son?
Papet says he wants to see you and the mayor.
- Papet wants to see you both.
- Me?
He said to come quickly.
- Where is he?
- At Romarins, waiting for you.
What can Cesar want?
Put him on the table.
Put him here.
Go to the village and tell the woman to bring some candles from the church.
At least six big ones...
And the linen sheet his grandmother wove...
Pamphile, prepare the coffin.
You've got those oak boards in the attic... the ones I wanted for myself.
The ones you asked me to order.
Use them for him.
Can I ask you all to say he fell from a tree.
Keep the suicide secret until after the funeral.
Otherwise the priest won't want to bury him properly.
Now you can all go.
- I'll stay with you.
- There's no need to.
She should have married him anyhow and avenged herself by making his life hell on earth.
Papet, I can't go on living.
I don't care about the carnations;
it's because of my love.
She'll never love me.
I suspected so because I've got an infection from her ribbon.
And when I told her I wanted to marry her, she spat at me in a fury.
Besides, she prefers the teacher.
When he talks to her, she lowers her eyes.
When he stops, she's eager for him to start again.
He doesn't even think about it, but takes it for granted.
He's a happy man, and I'm miserable.
I can't bear it any longer.
I'd like to kill him, but that would grieve her, so I won't deprive her of him.
I'm giving her my farm and what's hidden next to the fireplace.
You know where.
Don't make any trouble.
It's not her fault or yours: it's just fate.
Arrange a Mass for me.
I'll have to account for the spring up there.
Adieu, Papet.
I'm sorry to leave you, but I can't go on living.
Do you know?
Yes.
What will you do?
I don't know.
I won't go back to that house.
Too many bad memories.
I'd always think of his body on the tree... and his smell in the house.
Will you join the procession?
If you're absolutely sure the water won't come back, you should go.
If your father could have brought back their spring, what would he have done?
I think he'd have wanted their friendship.
If that's so, you must do likewise.
- Do you think the procession will help?
- You never know.
We'll see if the fountain responds to our prayers.
If it does, I'll have to go to confession.
That's the trouble:
if the water comes back, every fool might feel like you and I'll end up losing the election.
Miracles are very convincing.
Something's happening...
Stop!
It's gurgling!
There's a gurgling in the pipe.
A miracle!
On your knees!
On your knees, everybody!
It's not a miracle!
It's just a coincidence.
I recognised your footsteps.
Your ears are sharp.
My hearing can't replace my eyesight, Cesar.
Belly dancing's all very well, but you made a mistake in going to North Africa.
I did?
I say mistake, but it was almost a crime.
What mistake do you mean?
When I was wounded, I was about to be promoted.
That's not what I meant.
I'm talking about the letter you received.
- What letter?
- One that deserved an answer... but you failed to respond.
A letter from whom?
You don't want to talk to me about it because you think I don't know.
- I swear, Delphine.
- Don't swear, you sinner!
I'm sorry to be stirring up a bitter memory.
A bitter memory?
Delphine, we're beside the church, in the presence of the cross.
I swear by that cross that I received no letter except from my father, Anglade and Castagne.
If that's the truth, it's tragic.
Why?
Swear again that you're not lying to me.
I swear it.
Who wrote to me?
Florette.
Florette Camoins?
There was no other Florette.
Are you sure?
I gave the letter to the postman.
I'd never have forgotten a letter from her.
I still have two faded notes she wrote me... and one of her combs.
That's it.
When I came back, she'd left the village.
She'd married that blacksmith from Crespin.
She already had a child.
Is it possible her letter didn't reach you?
Over there we kept on moving around.
Sometimes we didn't get food or even ammunition.
It's definitely possible that letters got lost as well.
But if there'd been one from her
I'd know it by heart.
If that's true, it's dreadful!
- Do you think she loved me?
- You old fool!
She never admitted it... not even after what we did one night in Anglade's barn.
That's just the way she was.
But in her letter she wrote that she was pregnant.
- What?
- Yes.
You'd been gone three weeks.
She said that if you wrote to promise her father to marry her, she'd wait for you.
She'd have shown your letter to everybody so that no-one would laugh at her.
Are you sure?
The poor girl couldn't sleep.
She tried to get rid of the baby with magic potions.
She jumped from high rocks in the hills, but nothing worked.
She came to hate you.
She went to Aubagne, where she met that blacksmith from Crespin.
So she left the village and no-one ever knew when the child was born.
Was it alive?
Yes, alive.
But a hunchback.
I hear Clairette coming for me.
Come on over, girl.
It's getting chilly.
I want to sit by the fireside.
Adieu, Cesar.
Don't worry.
I've never told anyone.
I'll pray for you.
- What's wrong, Papet?
Are you ill?
- No, no.
Don't stay out here.
Come inside.
- Shall I call a doctor?
- No.
- I could call through to Ombrees.
- No.
I know what's wrong with me.
Lean on me.
I'll take you home.
My friend, I don't believe you're near death.
I believe I am.
I know I'm going to die tonight.
Why do you think so?
I'll die because I don't want to live.
Let's get on with the confession.
You can see I need to confess.
Remember, suicide is a cardinal sin.
I've no need to kill myself.
I'll simply let myself go.
Please God, don't let her baby be a hunchback.
Dear little Manon,
I am leaving you my whole estate.
You may wonder why, but it's the truth.
The solicitor will give you all the documents.
It's because your father was my son, the Soubeyran I'd hoped for all my life.
I tormented him to death because I didn't know who he was.
If I'd told him about the spring, he'd still be playing his harmonica and you'd all be living in our family home.
No-one knows about it, but even so, I'm bitterly ashamed.
In the village, there's one person who'll tell you the truth.
It's Delphine, the old blind woman.
She'll explain how it's all because of Africa.
I don't deserve to kiss you and I never dared to speak to you, but maybe now you can forgive me and even pray for poor Ugolin and me.
Even I find myself a pitiable being.
I think it was because of spite that I never went near him.
I never heard his voice or saw his face or his eyes, which might have been like his mother's.
All I saw was his hump and the grief I caused him.
You'll understand why I want to die.
I'm so hounded by my miserable thoughts that even hell will be a blessed release.
I'm not afraid to see him up there, now he knows he's a Soubeyran and it's not my fault he's a hunchback.
He realises it was all a foolish mistake.
I'm sure he won't resent me, but will even defend me.
Farewell, my darling girl.
Your grandfather, Cesar Soubeyran.
Here.
Next time I won't pay this much.
The competition from Italy is ruining me.
This barely pays for fertiliser for the flowers.
Next year we'll grow chick peas.
I'd miss our aperitifs together.
What is it?
What are you barking at?
I'm not going to steal your goats.
Leave my bread alone!
Here, we'll share my lunch.
Hold on...
leave some for me!
- Hello, chaps!
- Hello.
What did you do today, Bernard?
I went for a walk in the hills.
Look what I found.
Lignite.
The hills are full of it.
Interesting.
- I saw some goats.
- It's the hunchback's girl's herd.
The little savage!
She's been hiding from us since her father died.
I've seen her.
She's a real beauty.
She must take after her mother.
For a hunchback, he had a lovely daughter.
Who was this hunchback?
You never met him, Mr Belloiseau.
You didn't live here then.
He was a city intellectual who wanted to be a farmer.
- He was a loony!
- I'm not so sure of it.
I'm not saying he was an idiot but he just wasn't practical.
He thought he could breed rabbits by doing sums on paper.
Only because there was no water at Romarins.
But you found some.
How's the flower trade?
Christmas and Shrove Tuesday are best, and Easter's pretty good, too.
How about deaths?
Not bad at all.
They bring in a certain amount.
Come along!
Quick!
Thank you.
There's a letter for you.
My darling,
Tonight we're playing Ai'da in Bordeaux.
I've only got a small part, but I'm so pleased.
If only you were with me, I'd be almost happy.
Your loving mother.
You can't stay here for ever.
You should be with your mother.
No hares, no rabbits, no birds...
Where have they got to?
Maybe I'm going deaf and blind.
Next time I'll bring a hound along.
That one won't get away.
Galinette!
Do you know it's five o'clock?
That was some nap!
I think I must have caught the sun.
No, you're not red.
You must be short of sleep.
Come on out.
She may be deaf, but she guesses everything.
What I've got to say is just between the two of us.
Galinette, you're past thirty, and you're the last of the Soubeyrans.
I know all that...
Don't interrupt!
If I'm repeating myself, that's your fault.
I'll talk till you understand.
We Soubeyrans were the most important family of this region.
- On Grandpa's birthday...
- There were more than 30 guests.
All of them Soubeyrans, with pots of gold hidden about the place.
We were respected.
Well, things have changed.
That's fate.
No!
Fate doesn't exist.
What happened to us is the fault of our elders.
They were proud and wanted to hold on to their money.
Cousins married cousins.
One uncle married his niece.
It's just as bad for men as for rabbits.
And what was the result?
Two madwomen and three suicides.
Now, it's just us.
It's too late for me, so it's all up to you.
You're telling me to get married.
Why didn't you?
I wasn't cut out for it.
Mind you, I almost did...
It didn't work out.
I joined up on an impulse and went to Africa.
When I came back...
If she'd given me a child, I'd have married her like a shot.
But it didn't happen.
I'm like Anglade's cherry trees:
lots of flowers, but no fruit.
- So I'm to marry instead of you?
- You've got to, Galinette.
But why should I?
Why?
You ask me why!
Isn't the Soubeyran fortune reason enough?
This isn't paper money we're talking about.
It's gold!
Pots full of gold coins.
Do you understand?
I own a fortune!
The fruit of saving, skimping and hard work.
- Do you want to chuck it all away?
- Of course not!
I love gold.
If you love it, you can't deprive it of a loving owner!
Papet, I can't make a family just like that!
- I've been telling you to for years!
- Now that you're more serious,
I'd rather make up my own mind.
Have you got your eye on someone?
Maybe.
Can't you tell me who?
Look, I've been out in the sun all day and I feel a bit dazed.
I will tell you, but not yet.
Fine.
You're a good boy, Galinette.
But one thing more...
When choosing a wife, think of the children.
What do you mean?
Don't get stuck on a pretty face.
We need a girl with wide hips, long legs and big tits!
Think of her as a brood mare.
What if she's pretty besides?
If it's besides, I won't object...
On the contrary.
I'd enjoy looking at a pretty Soubeyran.
Come on!
Over here, Noe!
Come on!
We do all the work even though everyone uses the water.
Cleaning the tank twice a year won't kill you!
What with this sand, if we want clean drinking water...
Better for vegetables, too.
It's not sticky.
It looks like clay, but it's not clay.
It's bauxite powder.
A mixture of iron and aluminium.
I wonder where it's from.
The spring deposits it here after big storms, but it doesn't reach the village.
The morning after a rainy night, my spring water's the colour of rust.
It is rust: it's iron oxide.
- Then it's not harmful.
- No, it's beneficial.
Where is your spring in relation to this tank?
What do you mean?
Is it higher up or lower down?
It's hard to say.
I think the Romarins spring is higher up.
The village water must come from here and follow the same course.
- It's ten o'clock.
- I said I'd have the water on by noon!
That's two hours away.
But it takes an hour for it to reach the village.
Much though I enjoy your company, I have to see the mayor.
Don't keep him waiting!
Hey!
Someone's throwing stones!
I saw a flash of lightning!
At ten o'clock?
You must have started drinking early.
I swear I've had only a coffee!
It's my knife.
I lost it in the hills a few days ago.
- Around here?
- No.
I've never been here before.
- That's very odd.
- It's a gift from the goatherd.
- Which goatherd?
Do you mean Manon?
- Yes, the hunchback's kid.
Who else?
- Is she hiding up there?
- She'll have run away.
Too bad!
I'd like to thank her.
- Some other time!
- Thank her with a little kiss.
It's odd.
After all that talk, I dreamt about her the other night.
- In my dream, I kissed her.
- Did she let you?
In my dreams women rarely resist me.
- Aren't you eating?
- I'm not hungry.
You haven't looked well lately.
I've lost my appetite.
It's probably the poison.
What poison?
The one I spray on my carnations to kill the spiders.
- I'll do it for you.
- No.
You have to use it at night.
Sunlight does it no good.
It makes it less potent.
Daylight destroys its effectiveness.
You work at night, but don't sleep days.
You're never home.
What do you do with yourself all day long?
I go hunting and wander about the hills.
I breathe fresh air.
I need to clear my lungs of the poison.
True.
It's good for the carnations but bad for you.
You've got to eat and sleep.
- Do you want to see the doctor?
- No, I'll be all right.
See?
I'm eating.
She's going to Aubagne to sell my birds.
He's going mad!
- Who is it?
- Me!
- I know that!
Who's the woman?
- What woman?
The one you've been following to Aubagne.
I've been watching you.
And what about those birds you've been catching?
Are you going mad, or what?
Are you in love?
That's a great illness!
So who is she?
If you won't tell me, she can't be altogether nice... or else she's married.
Yes, yes, that's it!
She's married.
She's married!
- Open up, imbecile!
- No, I won't!
- We can talk through the door.
- Why?
If I can't see you, I might tell you something.
You're as mad as your poor father.
What do you want to tell me?
I don't want to, but you're insisting, so ask away!
Tell me who she is!
No, I won't!
- A city girl?
- On the contrary!
Good!
Do I know her?
- Not really.
- What do you mean?
You're bound to guess who it is.
So I know her?
See?
You know I don't want to tell you, but you insist on interrogating me.
- Well, I won't answer.
- Why not?
Because...
Because it's my secret.
My first secret love.
In that case, I'm going.
Bye!
No, stay here!
I want to talk about her.
- I don't even know who she is.
- But I do!
Papet, are you going?
No, I'm rolling a cigarette.
So, you want to marry her?
Yes, but she won't have me.
- Why not?
- She's pretty and I'm ugly.
Has she got money?
Not much.
Is she healthy?
Yes, she's as strong as a horse.
She's got good muscles.
She could do a good job on my carnations.
- And she's educated.
- How do you know?
She reads books for hours at a time.
That sounds bad.
I'm wary of a poor girl who reads books.
Besides, a beautiful wife may be fickle.
Is she virtuous?
Wild and pure as the driven snow.
She'd be a wonderful wife.
I'd be happy as a king but she wouldn't want me.
No poor girl would reject a Soubeyran... unless she's mad.
If she said yes, would you consent?
I can't until I know who she is.
Come on, you fool!
Open up and tell me!
No!
I can't open the door!
I've got to think.
- Papet...
- Yes?
I'll tell you, but you must swear on the family name that when you hear her name you won't say a word.
- As you like.
- No!
Swear to me!
I swear on the name of the Soubeyrans.
Good.
Now I've got to decide.
I'm not opening the door;
I'm just taking out the key.
Put your ear next to the keyhole.
It's Manon, the hunchback's daughter.
In 20 years' time, she'll think you too old for her and she might be unfaithful.
Not a girl like her.
She's just like the rest of them.
But never mind.
By then you'll have your family of sturdy Soubeyrans.
She's lovely.
You have my consent.
- Have you seen her?
- Yes, I have.
- What do you think?
- I told you.
She's lovely.
She seems mature for her age.
She looks at least 18.
- Do you know who she looks like?
- Nobody.
Yes, she does.
She looks like someone you never knew.
- Her grandmother.
- Did you know her?
Florette Camoins.
The great beauty.
I'm glad to meet you at last.
I wanted to thank you for my knife.
- How did you know it was mine?
- I saw you eating with it the other day.
I'm the new teacher.
I'm making a collection of local rocks so I can teach my pupils about their land.
I thought you were a gold-digger.
It's all cretaceous, from the Quaternary era.
You know a lot for a country girl.
My father taught me.
- I'd like you to keep this.
- I've got one.
- That one's too fancy for me.
- It's not!
Why shouldn't a goatherd have a good knife?
It's got four blades and a nail file.
And some scissors.
I know.
I used them.
It's the first one I've trapped.
It's a baby.
The hawks eat the big ones.
That hare's my offering to you.
My class begins soon.
I've got to go.
I'll leave this on a rock.
Someone will be glad to find it.
She doesn't want your knife.
- I'll keep it if you take the hare.
- Fine.
Thanks.
- Papet...
- Yes.
What's the best way to talk to girls?
I don't know how to talk about love.
So, you've made up your mind?
Yes.
I'd better hurry because she often goes to Aubagne and she might meet a man who'll take her from me.
- Where will you talk to her?
- In the hills.
I'll pretend I'm gathering snails and didn't see her.
Hang on!
If you do that, it'll look as if you're poor.
Show your wealth!
Don't wear your old clothes.
You should wear a new suit, a hunting outfit with leather leggings and a hat to match.
And most important of all...
Wear braces!
Excuse me...
I'm looking for a hare I shot which must be wounded.
Aren't you Manon, the daughter of poor Monsieur Jean?
I see you don't remember me.
That's because I've changed a lot.
I'm Ugolin, your poor father's friend.
You've changed, too.
You're a proper little lady.
I barely recognised you.
Perhaps you're wondering why we haven't met before.
I don't have time to hunt any more because of my carnations.
Did you know I grew carnations?
I've been very successful.
I've made lots of money.
The money's all in gold coins!
With my savings, I'll be worth 50,000 francs in two years.
Would you like to move back to Romarins?
I could stay in my house in Massacan and you could tend to my flowers.
Manon, listen to me!
I know why you don't want to.
It's because you're proud.
But your pride's no problem.
Carnations must be watered and picked.
A woman will do that well.
I'll pay you.
You'll be well paid.
It's not to give you work.
I was lying.
It's because I love you.
I love you with all my heart!
Manon!
I want to marry you!
I'm all alone!
I've got no-one!
My grandparents are dead.
My father hanged himself when I was little.
My mother died of the flu.
There's only Uncle Papet!
He's rich, he's old.
He's going to die.
He's going to leave me all his money.
It'll be yours, because I love you!
I love you!
I am sick for the love of you.
It's suffocating me!
I saw you bathing in the rainwater.
I watched for hours.
You were so lovely.
I was tempted to commit a crime.
- Did you talk to her?
- I didn't see her.
- She must have gone to Aubagne.
- Then do it tomorrow.
Maybe.
I have to get used to this outfit.
You look great!
Like a hunter from Marseilles.
- Look!
See that?
- A nice little thrush.
- That girl must have trapped it.
- Really?
Yes.
See?
There's her herd.
She can't be far off.
I always respect other people's traps.
And it's this poor girl's only livelihood.
I've seen her selling birds in Aubagne.
- We've done her enough harm already.
- Not on purpose.
It wasn't our fault.
It was.
We all knew there was a spring at Romarins but no-one said anything.
- So why didn't you tell him?
- Because of Amelie.
- Shall we eat?
- Let's.
I used to go hunting over there and see that poor hunchback dowsing for water.
Once, he was right above it but the rod didn't move.
Later, I saw him digging in the wrong place and it kept on bothering me.
I told Amelie and she flew into such a rage.
It was none of our business.
Hunchbacks are bad luck.
He was an outsider, from Crespin, etc, etc.
You know what she's like.
She made me swear to say nothing.
- So you didn't?
- No.
- Ugolin and Papet were real bastards.
- On that score, we were all bastards.
- Papet, my spring's dried up!
- What?
- No water.
- None at all?
No.
I dug a deep hole.
Not a drop.
- My carnations are budding.
- 1 5,000 of them.
- There's your tank.
- In two days, it'll be empty.
Springs are capricious.
I bet it'll flow again in three months.
Three months!
Oh, Lord!
Stop it, you fool!
Get up!
It's probably already flowing again.
If not, we can transport enough water using a few mules.
It used to flow.
When the hunchback came, it stopped...
Hey!
There's something wrong with the fountain.
- Come and see.
- Impossible!
- Not here, too?
We're ruined!
- Calm down!
Well?
There must be a frog blocking the pipe.
We're stuck, like Ugolin.
Impossible!
It's flowed for 50 years.
Let's check the tank.
Nothing.
- Right.
I'm off.
- Don't worry.
Monsieur Jean, you're a good man and you're up in heaven.
You can see that my feet are so swollen I can hardly walk, that my mule's half dead.
If this continues, my carnations will be ruined.
Please, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, give us back your daughter's spring.
Amen.
Help us!
Amen, damn it!
Hello?
Yes, I'm the mayor.
How soon can he get here?
Tomorrow?
We'll be dead by then!
We need him now.
We've got no bread.
Our crops are ruined.
It's a catastrophe.
Then I'll expect him at seven at the public hall.
Thank you.
- The expert will be here tomorrow.
- What expert?
The Rural Engineering expert I've been asking for.
I declare the meeting open.
We're meeting to discuss the problem of water.
- It's not a problem: it's a disaster!
- Quite right.
But thanks to my personal initiative and my phone, the local authority has sent us expert help.
This is the expert.
Gentlemen, I've studied your problem, and this is what I shall report to the Chief Engineer.
The Perdrix spring which supplied your fountain is the main source of water for this whole region.
It runs between two layers of limestone.
The spring is not diaclistic, but a Vauclusian resurgence.
Let's not forget that, eh?
Thus, the water flowed between two impervious strata, pressing against the upper layer.
The pressure generated forced water into the tank.
Gravity then ensured the flow of water from the tank to the village.
Right.
Gravity.
At the request of your mayor and with local authority permission, we have examined the cause of the present obstruction.
First, where is the source of the water?
I have here a useful document...
It's an analysis by the Chief Engineer clearly stating the results of experiments made in the region some five years ago.
Sadly, there's no indication whatever of a spring in this area.
There's no stream within the orography of the Huveaune river.
What does that mean?
The source of your water is some way away.
- I want to speak.
- This isn't the time.
I'll make it short.
Just let him turn on the water.
He can explain later.
I'm not a plumber.
Now, the first hypothesis is drought.
The trouble may be due to a drop in the water table.
The watercourse is determined by seams of dolomite in the limestone.
It can cross the seams via a network of siphons.
You know what that is?
You use them in winemaking.
Precisely.
During the rainy season, the siphons are reactivated as soon as the water table rises to its normal level.
What table?
Quiet!
To oppose progress is a sure sign of ignorance!
If progress turns my water on, I'm all for it, and, if my spring flows again, here's my 100 francs for progress.
Let's hear the rest... the rest of his rubbish.
Now, the second hypothesis.
The subterranean stream drops into a network of cavities.
Once they're full, the water rises and the spring will flow again.
- How soon?
- I really couldn't say.
Perhaps in two days, perhaps in two years.
Or a hundred years!
That's not to be ruled out.
Third hypothesis...
To hell with your theories!
What can you do for us right now?
The administration can provide a daily truck with 1 ,300 gallons of water.
That should cover your daily needs.
How much do I get for my flowers?
If we've got no water by next month, what'll you do?
We'd suggest you farm the land elsewhere.
There's no lack of villages where water is plentiful.
Our council can never accept that!
Your council's influence on natural phenomena is next to zero.
- The third hypothesis...
- To hell with their hypo-thingies!
The administration's just a waste of time!
In that case, the administration says you can go to hell!
The water truck will be here in two days.
Meanwhile, gentlemen, I wish you good luck.
Where is he?
Where's the head of the Water Board?
I'm not the head of the Water Board:
you are!
Only because I'm the mayor and I've got a phone.
- See this?
What's this?
- It's your receipt.
Right. 52 francs plus the stamp.
So, where's the water I paid for?
The expert explained it's the orography.
That's the whole problem.
I don't give a damn!
I paid for my water and I want it.
Listen...
They'll send a lorry of water daily.
Just bring your mule and you'll get 40 gallons of water like the rest of us.
One:
I haven't got a mule, only a donkey.
Two: 40 gallons are enough for a cafe but not my field.
Three:
I paid for spring water, not truck water.
- The truck water must be spring water.
- Not from my spring!
I want my water.
Stop yelling.
You're driving us mad.
What about my aubergines?
And my tomatoes are just ripening.
It's the same for everyone.
Damn that!
I've paid and I want my water.
The spring's dry.
How can we get water?
I don't care, as long as I get mine back.
And you - mind your own business!
You may be a councillor but I didn't vote for you.
Who cares about your vote?
- Why us?
Who do you think we are?
- Water thieves!
Stop!
Stop it!
Good morning.
Today's my birthday and I'd like to invite you over for a drink after Mass.
I had no say over my birth date.
Dearly beloved, I am truly happy to see you all gathered in our little church.
The whole parish is here, including some clever folks - too clever, perhaps - who generally ignore Mass and hang around in the cafe.
I won't name it - it's our only cafe - or name them, since everyone's staring at them already.
I hope this shames them, rather than making them laugh.
Your hands are joined, your eyes moist.
Today you are all steeped in faith.
But God knows that your piety is due to your spring and that your prayers are merely pleas for your beans, orisons for your tomatoes, hallelujahs for your potatoes, and hosannas for your marrows!
Now, I must speak seriously about the spring.
I keep asking myself the question:
Why has this water, once so plentiful, suddenly dried up in our hour of need?
I once read in a Greek tragedy, a profane work of literature, that Thebes was struck by a calamitous plague because its king had committed some crimes.
And so I ask myself:
Is there a criminal among us?
It's quite possible, since many wicked crimes escape the justice of men, but the Good Lord knows all about them!
So, if this criminal does exist, let me now appeal to him.
Let me say to him:
My brother, there's no sin that cannot be forgiven, no crime that can't be atoned for by the most sincere repentance.
According to Jesus Christ himself, there will always be room in heaven for a repentant sinner.
So, whatever your offence, try to redeem yourself.
Repent and you shall be saved!
And our spring will flow again as before.
- Papet!
- Yes?
He meant us.
He looked at me three times.
What could he know?
He's only been here for a year.
Maybe somebody told him in confession.
It's possible Anglade did it.
He's so self-righteous that he's liable to confess other people's sins.
- I'm worried about the girl.
- So am I.
She seemed hostile to you.
She looked at me twice, as if to say "You're the criminal".
- No, she knows nothing.
- Then why are you worried?
I don't think she wants you.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
Here's to our teacher's good health.
Here's to you!
- What did you think of that sermon?
- Nothing.
It's just a lot of talk.
I can't believe the spring dried up through an act of God.
He implied it was a criminal act.
He probably learnt about it through someone's confession.
What crime?
If someone here was guilty, we'd all know about it.
I'm sure he had someone in mind.
- Who?
- Yes, who?
- He looked at Ugolin a lot.
- Especially when he mentioned plague.
- I haven't got the plague!
- You shouldn't joke about such things.
- You smelled the Pernod!
- No, I came on account of the water.
- I've got something important to say.
- To me?
Yes.
You can bring our water back.
How can l?
By coming to the procession.
Will you?
If you refuse, our fountain will never flow again.
She's not a saint!
An orphan's prayer soars heavenwards like a lark.
Our Lord will listen to her.
She's innocent.
If she prays for us, we're saved.
Manon, you must come and save our flowers!
I won't pray for people who robbed my father.
I don't understand you.
They do.
They know why God is punishing them.
Do you know who the criminal is?
There are two of them.
Them.
I've had enough of this nonsense.
I'm going home.
Come on, Galinette.
- Your reaction might arouse suspicion...
- I don't care what you suspect.
My conscience is clear.
Let's go home!
- Come on!
- No.
I want to hear what she's got against me.
I can settle the whole matter.
- How did they steal your father's water?
- She's imagining things.
It's true that her father's lack of water ruined him.
But for his fatal accident, he might have found it.
Since the two women were in trouble, we bought the farmstead...
Partly because we liked it - that's true - but partly, too, to help them out.
Later on, purely by chance, we found the spring.
She calls that stealing her water.
Help thy neighbour - some joke!
Let's go.
It's not true!
He's lying!
He knew that spring was on our land.
What really happened is that you deliberately blocked it up.
- Why would they do that?
- To buy it cheap.
The dry land was worthless.
- Those two murdered my father!
- That's not true!
It's slander!
I found that spring with my watch.
You and your mother saw me looking for it.
- Tell the truth!
- In less than one hour?
God said to Pascal:
"You wouldn't look for me unless you'd already found me."
To hell with Pascal!
I only met him once.
He was so rude I slapped him.
You laugh, but it's true!
She denies what she saw, but she believes what she didn't see.
Who saw us block that spring?
You see!
Who saw us block it up?
I saw you.
Both of you.
Liar!
What did you see?
You don't know left from right!
In the army, he failed every test.
He was so stupid they sent him home.
That was exactly what I wanted.
It wasn't easy, but I got away with it...
Never mind that.
Tell us what you saw.
He saw nothing.
He dreamt it.
I never dream.
It was nine or ten years ago.
- See how vague he is?
- Just after Bouffigue died.
I was hunting at Romarins.
The partridges were drinking from a puddle near the empty farm, so I went inside.
Charming behaviour!
Stealing from a dead man's house!
It was so I could shoot the partridges from an upstairs window.
- First, I snoozed for a while.
- I knew it: he was dreaming.
I wasn't dreaming!
Suddenly, there was the sound of digging and it woke me up.
I saw them from the window - one digging and the other looking on.
I didn't dare move.
I saw the water gush out and then I saw them block the spring.
Why didn't you tell her father?
It was none of my business, but now we're all being punished it is my business.
Suppose that what he's said is true...
It's not, but let's just suppose it is...
You know I'd give her everything:
the spring, my flowers, my house, my money, the Soubeyran fortune and my life.
You know that.
I told you so in the hills.
I love you unbearably.
Listen...
Please listen, Manon.
Ever since I saw you, ever since I spoke to you, food has been turning to sawdust in my mouth, sleep's been a torment...
If you reject me, I'll die or go mad.
Shut up, you fool.
Let's go.
Just think how I feel.
I'm all mixed up, what with remorse for the harm I've done you and the happiness I want to offer you.
You must know how I'd slave for you!
- Oh, my love!
- Make him go away!
Don't be a fool!
Stand up!
Manon, you must realise, I'm going to die for the love of you, and no-one cares!
Galinette, come home!
No!
It's all your fault!
I've lost everything because of you.
If only I'd known.
Galinette, my boy!
I'm staying.
Since you're all against him, I'll defend him.
I don't see how you can.
You all know there was no spring at Romarins - just a puddle.
But I found the real spring.
You men, you're natives like me:
tell him there was no spring.
Listen: anyone who knew there was one and didn't tell the hunchback is responsible for his death.
- The old bastard!
- You knew!
Of course.
We all knew.
But we didn't dare denounce them to protect an outsider.
They hated my grandmother and wanted revenge.
Who's your grandmother?
Florette.
It's because she married a man from Crespin.
Florette was your grandmother?
Then the hunchback was Florette's son?
Papet says he wants to see you and the mayor.
- Papet wants to see you both.
- Me?
He said to come quickly.
- Where is he?
- At Romarins, waiting for you.
What can Cesar want?
Put him on the table.
Put him here.
Go to the village and tell the woman to bring some candles from the church.
At least six big ones...
And the linen sheet his grandmother wove...
Pamphile, prepare the coffin.
You've got those oak boards in the attic... the ones I wanted for myself.
The ones you asked me to order.
Use them for him.
Can I ask you all to say he fell from a tree.
Keep the suicide secret until after the funeral.
Otherwise the priest won't want to bury him properly.
Now you can all go.
- I'll stay with you.
- There's no need to.
She should have married him anyhow and avenged herself by making his life hell on earth.
Papet, I can't go on living.
I don't care about the carnations;
it's because of my love.
She'll never love me.
I suspected so because I've got an infection from her ribbon.
And when I told her I wanted to marry her, she spat at me in a fury.
Besides, she prefers the teacher.
When he talks to her, she lowers her eyes.
When he stops, she's eager for him to start again.
He doesn't even think about it, but takes it for granted.
He's a happy man, and I'm miserable.
I can't bear it any longer.
I'd like to kill him, but that would grieve her, so I won't deprive her of him.
I'm giving her my farm and what's hidden next to the fireplace.
You know where.
Don't make any trouble.
It's not her fault or yours: it's just fate.
Arrange a Mass for me.
I'll have to account for the spring up there.
Adieu, Papet.
I'm sorry to leave you, but I can't go on living.
Do you know?
Yes.
What will you do?
I don't know.
I won't go back to that house.
Too many bad memories.
I'd always think of his body on the tree... and his smell in the house.
Will you join the procession?
If you're absolutely sure the water won't come back, you should go.
If your father could have brought back their spring, what would he have done?
I think he'd have wanted their friendship.
If that's so, you must do likewise.
- Do you think the procession will help?
- You never know.
We'll see if the fountain responds to our prayers.
If it does, I'll have to go to confession.
That's the trouble:
if the water comes back, every fool might feel like you and I'll end up losing the election.
Miracles are very convincing.
Something's happening...
Stop!
It's gurgling!
There's a gurgling in the pipe.
A miracle!
On your knees!
On your knees, everybody!
It's not a miracle!
It's just a coincidence.
I recognised your footsteps.
Your ears are sharp.
My hearing can't replace my eyesight, Cesar.
Belly dancing's all very well, but you made a mistake in going to North Africa.
I did?
I say mistake, but it was almost a crime.
What mistake do you mean?
When I was wounded, I was about to be promoted.
That's not what I meant.
I'm talking about the letter you received.
- What letter?
- One that deserved an answer... but you failed to respond.
A letter from whom?
You don't want to talk to me about it because you think I don't know.
- I swear, Delphine.
- Don't swear, you sinner!
I'm sorry to be stirring up a bitter memory.
A bitter memory?
Delphine, we're beside the church, in the presence of the cross.
I swear by that cross that I received no letter except from my father, Anglade and Castagne.
If that's the truth, it's tragic.
Why?
Swear again that you're not lying to me.
I swear it.
Who wrote to me?
Florette.
Florette Camoins?
There was no other Florette.
Are you sure?
I gave the letter to the postman.
I'd never have forgotten a letter from her.
I still have two faded notes she wrote me... and one of her combs.
That's it.
When I came back, she'd left the village.
She'd married that blacksmith from Crespin.
She already had a child.
Is it possible her letter didn't reach you?
Over there we kept on moving around.
Sometimes we didn't get food or even ammunition.
It's definitely possible that letters got lost as well.
But if there'd been one from her
I'd know it by heart.
If that's true, it's dreadful!
- Do you think she loved me?
- You old fool!
She never admitted it... not even after what we did one night in Anglade's barn.
That's just the way she was.
But in her letter she wrote that she was pregnant.
- What?
- Yes.
You'd been gone three weeks.
She said that if you wrote to promise her father to marry her, she'd wait for you.
She'd have shown your letter to everybody so that no-one would laugh at her.
Are you sure?
The poor girl couldn't sleep.
She tried to get rid of the baby with magic potions.
She jumped from high rocks in the hills, but nothing worked.
She came to hate you.
She went to Aubagne, where she met that blacksmith from Crespin.
So she left the village and no-one ever knew when the child was born.
Was it alive?
Yes, alive.
But a hunchback.
I hear Clairette coming for me.
Come on over, girl.
It's getting chilly.
I want to sit by the fireside.
Adieu, Cesar.
Don't worry.
I've never told anyone.
I'll pray for you.
- What's wrong, Papet?
Are you ill?
- No, no.
Don't stay out here.
Come inside.
- Shall I call a doctor?
- No.
- I could call through to Ombrees.
- No.
I know what's wrong with me.
Lean on me.
I'll take you home.
My friend, I don't believe you're near death.
I believe I am.
I know I'm going to die tonight.
Why do you think so?
I'll die because I don't want to live.
Let's get on with the confession.
You can see I need to confess.
Remember, suicide is a cardinal sin.
I've no need to kill myself.
I'll simply let myself go.
Please God, don't let her baby be a hunchback.
Dear little Manon,
I am leaving you my whole estate.
You may wonder why, but it's the truth.
The solicitor will give you all the documents.
It's because your father was my son, the Soubeyran I'd hoped for all my life.
I tormented him to death because I didn't know who he was.
If I'd told him about the spring, he'd still be playing his harmonica and you'd all be living in our family home.
No-one knows about it, but even so, I'm bitterly ashamed.
In the village, there's one person who'll tell you the truth.
It's Delphine, the old blind woman.
She'll explain how it's all because of Africa.
I don't deserve to kiss you and I never dared to speak to you, but maybe now you can forgive me and even pray for poor Ugolin and me.
Even I find myself a pitiable being.
I think it was because of spite that I never went near him.
I never heard his voice or saw his face or his eyes, which might have been like his mother's.
All I saw was his hump and the grief I caused him.
You'll understand why I want to die.
I'm so hounded by my miserable thoughts that even hell will be a blessed release.
I'm not afraid to see him up there, now he knows he's a Soubeyran and it's not my fault he's a hunchback.
He realises it was all a foolish mistake.
I'm sure he won't resent me, but will even defend me.
Farewell, my darling girl.
Your grandfather, Cesar Soubeyran.
Next time I won't pay this much.
The competition from Italy is ruining me.
This barely pays for fertiliser for the flowers.
Next year we'll grow chick peas.
I'd miss our aperitifs together.
What is it?
What are you barking at?
I'm not going to steal your goats.
Leave my bread alone!
Here, we'll share my lunch.
Hold on...
leave some for me!
- Hello, chaps!
- Hello.
What did you do today, Bernard?
I went for a walk in the hills.
Look what I found.
Lignite.
The hills are full of it.
Interesting.
- I saw some goats.
- It's the hunchback's girl's herd.
The little savage!
She's been hiding from us since her father died.
I've seen her.
She's a real beauty.
She must take after her mother.
For a hunchback, he had a lovely daughter.
Who was this hunchback?
You never met him, Mr Belloiseau.
You didn't live here then.
He was a city intellectual who wanted to be a farmer.
- He was a loony!
- I'm not so sure of it.
I'm not saying he was an idiot but he just wasn't practical.
He thought he could breed rabbits by doing sums on paper.
Only because there was no water at Romarins.
But you found some.
How's the flower trade?
Christmas and Shrove Tuesday are best, and Easter's pretty good, too.
How about deaths?
Not bad at all.
They bring in a certain amount.
Come along!
Quick!
Thank you.
There's a letter for you.
My darling,
Tonight we're playing Ai'da in Bordeaux.
I've only got a small part, but I'm so pleased.
If only you were with me, I'd be almost happy.
Your loving mother.
You can't stay here for ever.
You should be with your mother.
No hares, no rabbits, no birds...
Where have they got to?
Maybe I'm going deaf and blind.
Next time I'll bring a hound along.
That one won't get away.
Galinette!
Do you know it's five o'clock?
That was some nap!
I think I must have caught the sun.
No, you're not red.
You must be short of sleep.
Come on out.
She may be deaf, but she guesses everything.
What I've got to say is just between the two of us.
Galinette, you're past thirty, and you're the last of the Soubeyrans.
I know all that...
Don't interrupt!
If I'm repeating myself, that's your fault.
I'll talk till you understand.
We Soubeyrans were the most important family of this region.
- On Grandpa's birthday...
- There were more than 30 guests.
All of them Soubeyrans, with pots of gold hidden about the place.
We were respected.
Well, things have changed.
That's fate.
No!
Fate doesn't exist.
What happened to us is the fault of our elders.
They were proud and wanted to hold on to their money.
Cousins married cousins.
One uncle married his niece.
It's just as bad for men as for rabbits.
And what was the result?
Two madwomen and three suicides.
Now, it's just us.
It's too late for me, so it's all up to you.
You're telling me to get married.
Why didn't you?
I wasn't cut out for it.
Mind you, I almost did...
It didn't work out.
I joined up on an impulse and went to Africa.
When I came back...
If she'd given me a child, I'd have married her like a shot.
But it didn't happen.
I'm like Anglade's cherry trees:
lots of flowers, but no fruit.
- So I'm to marry instead of you?
- You've got to, Galinette.
But why should I?
Why?
You ask me why!
Isn't the Soubeyran fortune reason enough?
This isn't paper money we're talking about.
It's gold!
Pots full of gold coins.
Do you understand?
I own a fortune!
The fruit of saving, skimping and hard work.
- Do you want to chuck it all away?
- Of course not!
I love gold.
If you love it, you can't deprive it of a loving owner!
Papet, I can't make a family just like that!
- I've been telling you to for years!
- Now that you're more serious,
I'd rather make up my own mind.
Have you got your eye on someone?
Maybe.
Can't you tell me who?
Look, I've been out in the sun all day and I feel a bit dazed.
I will tell you, but not yet.
Fine.
You're a good boy, Galinette.
But one thing more...
When choosing a wife, think of the children.
What do you mean?
Don't get stuck on a pretty face.
We need a girl with wide hips, long legs and big tits!
Think of her as a brood mare.
What if she's pretty besides?
If it's besides, I won't object...
On the contrary.
I'd enjoy looking at a pretty Soubeyran.
Come on!
Over here, Noe!
Come on!
We do all the work even though everyone uses the water.
Cleaning the tank twice a year won't kill you!
What with this sand, if we want clean drinking water...
Better for vegetables, too.
It's not sticky.
It looks like clay, but it's not clay.
It's bauxite powder.
A mixture of iron and aluminium.
I wonder where it's from.
The spring deposits it here after big storms, but it doesn't reach the village.
The morning after a rainy night, my spring water's the colour of rust.
It is rust: it's iron oxide.
- Then it's not harmful.
- No, it's beneficial.
Where is your spring in relation to this tank?
What do you mean?
Is it higher up or lower down?
It's hard to say.
I think the Romarins spring is higher up.
The village water must come from here and follow the same course.
- It's ten o'clock.
- I said I'd have the water on by noon!
That's two hours away.
But it takes an hour for it to reach the village.
Much though I enjoy your company, I have to see the mayor.
Don't keep him waiting!
Hey!
Someone's throwing stones!
I saw a flash of lightning!
At ten o'clock?
You must have started drinking early.
I swear I've had only a coffee!
It's my knife.
I lost it in the hills a few days ago.
- Around here?
- No.
I've never been here before.
- That's very odd.
- It's a gift from the goatherd.
- Which goatherd?
Do you mean Manon?
- Yes, the hunchback's kid.
Who else?
- Is she hiding up there?
- She'll have run away.
Too bad!
I'd like to thank her.
- Some other time!
- Thank her with a little kiss.
It's odd.
After all that talk, I dreamt about her the other night.
- In my dream, I kissed her.
- Did she let you?
In my dreams women rarely resist me.
- Aren't you eating?
- I'm not hungry.
You haven't looked well lately.
I've lost my appetite.
It's probably the poison.
What poison?
The one I spray on my carnations to kill the spiders.
- I'll do it for you.
- No.
You have to use it at night.
Sunlight does it no good.
It makes it less potent.
Daylight destroys its effectiveness.
You work at night, but don't sleep days.
You're never home.
What do you do with yourself all day long?
I go hunting and wander about the hills.
I breathe fresh air.
I need to clear my lungs of the poison.
True.
It's good for the carnations but bad for you.
You've got to eat and sleep.
- Do you want to see the doctor?
- No, I'll be all right.
See?
I'm eating.
She's going to Aubagne to sell my birds.
He's going mad!
- Who is it?
- Me!
- I know that!
Who's the woman?
- What woman?
The one you've been following to Aubagne.
I've been watching you.
And what about those birds you've been catching?
Are you going mad, or what?
Are you in love?
That's a great illness!
So who is she?
If you won't tell me, she can't be altogether nice... or else she's married.
Yes, yes, that's it!
She's married.
She's married!
- Open up, imbecile!
- No, I won't!
- We can talk through the door.
- Why?
If I can't see you, I might tell you something.
You're as mad as your poor father.
What do you want to tell me?
I don't want to, but you're insisting, so ask away!
Tell me who she is!
No, I won't!
- A city girl?
- On the contrary!
Good!
Do I know her?
- Not really.
- What do you mean?
You're bound to guess who it is.
So I know her?
See?
You know I don't want to tell you, but you insist on interrogating me.
- Well, I won't answer.
- Why not?
Because...
Because it's my secret.
My first secret love.
In that case, I'm going.
Bye!
No, stay here!
I want to talk about her.
- I don't even know who she is.
- But I do!
Papet, are you going?
No, I'm rolling a cigarette.
So, you want to marry her?
Yes, but she won't have me.
- Why not?
- She's pretty and I'm ugly.
Has she got money?
Not much.
Is she healthy?
Yes, she's as strong as a horse.
She's got good muscles.
She could do a good job on my carnations.
- And she's educated.
- How do you know?
She reads books for hours at a time.
That sounds bad.
I'm wary of a poor girl who reads books.
Besides, a beautiful wife may be fickle.
Is she virtuous?
Wild and pure as the driven snow.
She'd be a wonderful wife.
I'd be happy as a king but she wouldn't want me.
No poor girl would reject a Soubeyran... unless she's mad.
If she said yes, would you consent?
I can't until I know who she is.
Come on, you fool!
Open up and tell me!
No!
I can't open the door!
I've got to think.
- Papet...
- Yes?
I'll tell you, but you must swear on the family name that when you hear her name you won't say a word.
- As you like.
- No!
Swear to me!
I swear on the name of the Soubeyrans.
Good.
Now I've got to decide.
I'm not opening the door;
I'm just taking out the key.
Put your ear next to the keyhole.
It's Manon, the hunchback's daughter.
In 20 years' time, she'll think you too old for her and she might be unfaithful.
Not a girl like her.
She's just like the rest of them.
But never mind.
By then you'll have your family of sturdy Soubeyrans.
She's lovely.
You have my consent.
- Have you seen her?
- Yes, I have.
- What do you think?
- I told you.
She's lovely.
She seems mature for her age.
She looks at least 18.
- Do you know who she looks like?
- Nobody.
Yes, she does.
She looks like someone you never knew.
- Her grandmother.
- Did you know her?
Florette Camoins.
The great beauty.
I'm glad to meet you at last.
I wanted to thank you for my knife.
- How did you know it was mine?
- I saw you eating with it the other day.
I'm the new teacher.
I'm making a collection of local rocks so I can teach my pupils about their land.
I thought you were a gold-digger.
It's all cretaceous, from the Quaternary era.
You know a lot for a country girl.
My father taught me.
- I'd like you to keep this.
- I've got one.
- That one's too fancy for me.
- It's not!
Why shouldn't a goatherd have a good knife?
It's got four blades and a nail file.
And some scissors.
I know.
I used them.
It's the first one I've trapped.
It's a baby.
The hawks eat the big ones.
That hare's my offering to you.
My class begins soon.
I've got to go.
I'll leave this on a rock.
Someone will be glad to find it.
She doesn't want your knife.
- I'll keep it if you take the hare.
- Fine.
Thanks.
- Papet...
- Yes.
What's the best way to talk to girls?
I don't know how to talk about love.
So, you've made up your mind?
Yes.
I'd better hurry because she often goes to Aubagne and she might meet a man who'll take her from me.
- Where will you talk to her?
- In the hills.
I'll pretend I'm gathering snails and didn't see her.
Hang on!
If you do that, it'll look as if you're poor.
Show your wealth!
Don't wear your old clothes.
You should wear a new suit, a hunting outfit with leather leggings and a hat to match.
And most important of all...
Wear braces!
Excuse me...
I'm looking for a hare I shot which must be wounded.
Aren't you Manon, the daughter of poor Monsieur Jean?
I see you don't remember me.
That's because I've changed a lot.
I'm Ugolin, your poor father's friend.
You've changed, too.
You're a proper little lady.
I barely recognised you.
Perhaps you're wondering why we haven't met before.
I don't have time to hunt any more because of my carnations.
Did you know I grew carnations?
I've been very successful.
I've made lots of money.
The money's all in gold coins!
With my savings, I'll be worth 50,000 francs in two years.
Would you like to move back to Romarins?
I could stay in my house in Massacan and you could tend to my flowers.
Manon, listen to me!
I know why you don't want to.
It's because you're proud.
But your pride's no problem.
Carnations must be watered and picked.
A woman will do that well.
I'll pay you.
You'll be well paid.
It's not to give you work.
I was lying.
It's because I love you.
I love you with all my heart!
Manon!
I want to marry you!
I'm all alone!
I've got no-one!
My grandparents are dead.
My father hanged himself when I was little.
My mother died of the flu.
There's only Uncle Papet!
He's rich, he's old.
He's going to die.
He's going to leave me all his money.
It'll be yours, because I love you!
I love you!
I am sick for the love of you.
It's suffocating me!
I saw you bathing in the rainwater.
I watched for hours.
You were so lovely.
I was tempted to commit a crime.
- Did you talk to her?
- I didn't see her.
- She must have gone to Aubagne.
- Then do it tomorrow.
Maybe.
I have to get used to this outfit.
You look great!
Like a hunter from Marseilles.
- Look!
See that?
- A nice little thrush.
- That girl must have trapped it.
- Really?
Yes.
See?
There's her herd.
She can't be far off.
I always respect other people's traps.
And it's this poor girl's only livelihood.
I've seen her selling birds in Aubagne.
- We've done her enough harm already.
- Not on purpose.
It wasn't our fault.
It was.
We all knew there was a spring at Romarins but no-one said anything.
- So why didn't you tell him?
- Because of Amelie.
- Shall we eat?
- Let's.
I used to go hunting over there and see that poor hunchback dowsing for water.
Once, he was right above it but the rod didn't move.
Later, I saw him digging in the wrong place and it kept on bothering me.
I told Amelie and she flew into such a rage.
It was none of our business.
Hunchbacks are bad luck.
He was an outsider, from Crespin, etc, etc.
You know what she's like.
She made me swear to say nothing.
- So you didn't?
- No.
- Ugolin and Papet were real bastards.
- On that score, we were all bastards.
- No water.
- None at all?
No.
I dug a deep hole.
Not a drop.
- My carnations are budding.
- 1 5,000 of them.
- There's your tank.
- In two days, it'll be empty.
Springs are capricious.
I bet it'll flow again in three months.
Three months!
Oh, Lord!
Stop it, you fool!
Get up!
It's probably already flowing again.
If not, we can transport enough water using a few mules.
It used to flow.
When the hunchback came, it stopped...
Hey!
There's something wrong with the fountain.
- Come and see.
- Impossible!
- Not here, too?
We're ruined!
- Calm down!
Well?
There must be a frog blocking the pipe.
We're stuck, like Ugolin.
Impossible!
It's flowed for 50 years.
Let's check the tank.
Nothing.
- Right.
I'm off.
- Don't worry.
Monsieur Jean, you're a good man and you're up in heaven.
You can see that my feet are so swollen I can hardly walk, that my mule's half dead.
If this continues, my carnations will be ruined.
Please, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, give us back your daughter's spring.
Amen.
Help us!
Amen, damn it!
Hello?
Yes, I'm the mayor.
How soon can he get here?
Tomorrow?
We'll be dead by then!
We need him now.
We've got no bread.
Our crops are ruined.
It's a catastrophe.
Then I'll expect him at seven at the public hall.
Thank you.
- The expert will be here tomorrow.
- What expert?
The Rural Engineering expert I've been asking for.
I declare the meeting open.
We're meeting to discuss the problem of water.
- It's not a problem: it's a disaster!
- Quite right.
But thanks to my personal initiative and my phone, the local authority has sent us expert help.
This is the expert.
Gentlemen, I've studied your problem, and this is what I shall report to the Chief Engineer.
The Perdrix spring which supplied your fountain is the main source of water for this whole region.
It runs between two layers of limestone.
The spring is not diaclistic, but a Vauclusian resurgence.
Let's not forget that, eh?
Thus, the water flowed between two impervious strata, pressing against the upper layer.
The pressure generated forced water into the tank.
Gravity then ensured the flow of water from the tank to the village.
Right.
Gravity.
At the request of your mayor and with local authority permission, we have examined the cause of the present obstruction.
First, where is the source of the water?
I have here a useful document...
It's an analysis by the Chief Engineer clearly stating the results of experiments made in the region some five years ago.
Sadly, there's no indication whatever of a spring in this area.
There's no stream within the orography of the Huveaune river.
What does that mean?
The source of your water is some way away.
- I want to speak.
- This isn't the time.
I'll make it short.
Just let him turn on the water.
He can explain later.
I'm not a plumber.
Now, the first hypothesis is drought.
The trouble may be due to a drop in the water table.
The watercourse is determined by seams of dolomite in the limestone.
It can cross the seams via a network of siphons.
You know what that is?
You use them in winemaking.
Precisely.
During the rainy season, the siphons are reactivated as soon as the water table rises to its normal level.
What table?
Quiet!
To oppose progress is a sure sign of ignorance!
If progress turns my water on, I'm all for it, and, if my spring flows again, here's my 100 francs for progress.
Let's hear the rest... the rest of his rubbish.
Now, the second hypothesis.
The subterranean stream drops into a network of cavities.
Once they're full, the water rises and the spring will flow again.
- How soon?
- I really couldn't say.
Perhaps in two days, perhaps in two years.
Or a hundred years!
That's not to be ruled out.
Third hypothesis...
To hell with your theories!
What can you do for us right now?
The administration can provide a daily truck with 1 ,300 gallons of water.
That should cover your daily needs.
How much do I get for my flowers?
If we've got no water by next month, what'll you do?
We'd suggest you farm the land elsewhere.
There's no lack of villages where water is plentiful.
Our council can never accept that!
Your council's influence on natural phenomena is next to zero.
- The third hypothesis...
- To hell with their hypo-thingies!
The administration's just a waste of time!
In that case, the administration says you can go to hell!
The water truck will be here in two days.
Meanwhile, gentlemen, I wish you good luck.
Where is he?
Where's the head of the Water Board?
I'm not the head of the Water Board:
you are!
Only because I'm the mayor and I've got a phone.
- See this?
What's this?
- It's your receipt.
Right. 52 francs plus the stamp.
So, where's the water I paid for?
The expert explained it's the orography.
That's the whole problem.
I don't give a damn!
I paid for my water and I want it.
Listen...
They'll send a lorry of water daily.
Just bring your mule and you'll get 40 gallons of water like the rest of us.
One:
I haven't got a mule, only a donkey.
Two: 40 gallons are enough for a cafe but not my field.
Three:
I paid for spring water, not truck water.
- The truck water must be spring water.
- Not from my spring!
I want my water.
Stop yelling.
You're driving us mad.
What about my aubergines?
And my tomatoes are just ripening.
It's the same for everyone.
Damn that!
I've paid and I want my water.
The spring's dry.
How can we get water?
I don't care, as long as I get mine back.
And you - mind your own business!
You may be a councillor but I didn't vote for you.
Who cares about your vote?
- Why us?
Who do you think we are?
- Water thieves!
Stop!
Stop it!
Good morning.
Today's my birthday and I'd like to invite you over for a drink after Mass.
I had no say over my birth date.
Dearly beloved, I am truly happy to see you all gathered in our little church.
The whole parish is here, including some clever folks - too clever, perhaps - who generally ignore Mass and hang around in the cafe.
I won't name it - it's our only cafe - or name them, since everyone's staring at them already.
I hope this shames them, rather than making them laugh.
Your hands are joined, your eyes moist.
Today you are all steeped in faith.
But God knows that your piety is due to your spring and that your prayers are merely pleas for your beans, orisons for your tomatoes, hallelujahs for your potatoes, and hosannas for your marrows!
Now, I must speak seriously about the spring.
I keep asking myself the question:
Why has this water, once so plentiful, suddenly dried up in our hour of need?
I once read in a Greek tragedy, a profane work of literature, that Thebes was struck by a calamitous plague because its king had committed some crimes.
And so I ask myself:
Is there a criminal among us?
It's quite possible, since many wicked crimes escape the justice of men, but the Good Lord knows all about them!
So, if this criminal does exist, let me now appeal to him.
Let me say to him:
My brother, there's no sin that cannot be forgiven, no crime that can't be atoned for by the most sincere repentance.
According to Jesus Christ himself, there will always be room in heaven for a repentant sinner.
So, whatever your offence, try to redeem yourself.
Repent and you shall be saved!
And our spring will flow again as before.
- Papet!
- Yes?
He meant us.
He looked at me three times.
What could he know?
He's only been here for a year.
Maybe somebody told him in confession.
It's possible Anglade did it.
He's so self-righteous that he's liable to confess other people's sins.
- I'm worried about the girl.
- So am I.
She seemed hostile to you.
She looked at me twice, as if to say "You're the criminal".
- No, she knows nothing.
- Then why are you worried?
I don't think she wants you.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
Here's to our teacher's good health.
Here's to you!
- What did you think of that sermon?
- Nothing.
It's just a lot of talk.
I can't believe the spring dried up through an act of God.
He implied it was a criminal act.
He probably learnt about it through someone's confession.
What crime?
If someone here was guilty, we'd all know about it.
I'm sure he had someone in mind.
- Who?
- Yes, who?
- He looked at Ugolin a lot.
- Especially when he mentioned plague.
- I haven't got the plague!
- You shouldn't joke about such things.
- You smelled the Pernod!
- No, I came on account of the water.
- I've got something important to say.
- To me?
Yes.
You can bring our water back.
How can l?
By coming to the procession.
Will you?
If you refuse, our fountain will never flow again.
She's not a saint!
An orphan's prayer soars heavenwards like a lark.
Our Lord will listen to her.
She's innocent.
If she prays for us, we're saved.
Manon, you must come and save our flowers!
I won't pray for people who robbed my father.
I don't understand you.
They do.
They know why God is punishing them.
Do you know who the criminal is?
There are two of them.
Them.
I've had enough of this nonsense.
I'm going home.
Come on, Galinette.
- Your reaction might arouse suspicion...
- I don't care what you suspect.
My conscience is clear.
Let's go home!
- Come on!
- No.
I want to hear what she's got against me.
I can settle the whole matter.
- How did they steal your father's water?
- She's imagining things.
It's true that her father's lack of water ruined him.
But for his fatal accident, he might have found it.
Since the two women were in trouble, we bought the farmstead...
Partly because we liked it - that's true - but partly, too, to help them out.
Later on, purely by chance, we found the spring.
She calls that stealing her water.
Help thy neighbour - some joke!
Let's go.
It's not true!
He's lying!
He knew that spring was on our land.
What really happened is that you deliberately blocked it up.
- Why would they do that?
- To buy it cheap.
The dry land was worthless.
- Those two murdered my father!
- That's not true!
It's slander!
I found that spring with my watch.
You and your mother saw me looking for it.
- Tell the truth!
- In less than one hour?
God said to Pascal:
"You wouldn't look for me unless you'd already found me."
To hell with Pascal!
I only met him once.
He was so rude I slapped him.
You laugh, but it's true!
She denies what she saw, but she believes what she didn't see.
Who saw us block that spring?
You see!
Who saw us block it up?
I saw you.
Both of you.
Liar!
What did you see?
You don't know left from right!
In the army, he failed every test.
He was so stupid they sent him home.
That was exactly what I wanted.
It wasn't easy, but I got away with it...
Never mind that.
Tell us what you saw.
He saw nothing.
He dreamt it.
I never dream.
It was nine or ten years ago.
- See how vague he is?
- Just after Bouffigue died.
I was hunting at Romarins.
The partridges were drinking from a puddle near the empty farm, so I went inside.
Charming behaviour!
Stealing from a dead man's house!
It was so I could shoot the partridges from an upstairs window.
- First, I snoozed for a while.
- I knew it: he was dreaming.
I wasn't dreaming!
Suddenly, there was the sound of digging and it woke me up.
I saw them from the window - one digging and the other looking on.
I didn't dare move.
I saw the water gush out and then I saw them block the spring.
Why didn't you tell her father?
It was none of my business, but now we're all being punished it is my business.
Suppose that what he's said is true...
It's not, but let's just suppose it is...
You know I'd give her everything:
the spring, my flowers, my house, my money, the Soubeyran fortune and my life.
You know that.
I told you so in the hills.
I love you unbearably.
Listen...
Please listen, Manon.
Ever since I saw you, ever since I spoke to you, food has been turning to sawdust in my mouth, sleep's been a torment...
If you reject me, I'll die or go mad.
Shut up, you fool.
Let's go.
Just think how I feel.
I'm all mixed up, what with remorse for the harm I've done you and the happiness I want to offer you.
You must know how I'd slave for you!
- Oh, my love!
- Make him go away!
Don't be a fool!
Stand up!
Manon, you must realise, I'm going to die for the love of you, and no-one cares!
Galinette, come home!
No!
It's all your fault!
I've lost everything because of you.
If only I'd known.
Galinette, my boy!
I'm staying.
Since you're all against him, I'll defend him.
I don't see how you can.
You all know there was no spring at Romarins - just a puddle.
But I found the real spring.
You men, you're natives like me:
tell him there was no spring.
Listen: anyone who knew there was one and didn't tell the hunchback is responsible for his death.
- The old bastard!
- You knew!
Of course.
We all knew.
But we didn't dare denounce them to protect an outsider.
They hated my grandmother and wanted revenge.
Who's your grandmother?
Florette.
It's because she married a man from Crespin.
Florette was your grandmother?
Then the hunchback was Florette's son?
Papet says he wants to see you and the mayor.
- Papet wants to see you both.
- Me?
He said to come quickly.
- Where is he?
- At Romarins, waiting for you.
What can Cesar want?
Put him on the table.
Put him here.
Go to the village and tell the woman to bring some candles from the church.
At least six big ones...
And the linen sheet his grandmother wove...
Pamphile, prepare the coffin.
You've got those oak boards in the attic... the ones I wanted for myself.
The ones you asked me to order.
Use them for him.
Can I ask you all to say he fell from a tree.
Keep the suicide secret until after the funeral.
Otherwise the priest won't want to bury him properly.
Now you can all go.
- I'll stay with you.
- There's no need to.
She should have married him anyhow and avenged herself by making his life hell on earth.
Papet, I can't go on living.
I don't care about the carnations;
it's because of my love.
She'll never love me.
I suspected so because I've got an infection from her ribbon.
And when I told her I wanted to marry her, she spat at me in a fury.
Besides, she prefers the teacher.
When he talks to her, she lowers her eyes.
When he stops, she's eager for him to start again.
He doesn't even think about it, but takes it for granted.
He's a happy man, and I'm miserable.
I can't bear it any longer.
I'd like to kill him, but that would grieve her, so I won't deprive her of him.
I'm giving her my farm and what's hidden next to the fireplace.
You know where.
Don't make any trouble.
It's not her fault or yours: it's just fate.
Arrange a Mass for me.
I'll have to account for the spring up there.
Adieu, Papet.
I'm sorry to leave you, but I can't go on living.
Do you know?
Yes.
What will you do?
I don't know.
I won't go back to that house.
Too many bad memories.
I'd always think of his body on the tree... and his smell in the house.
Will you join the procession?
If you're absolutely sure the water won't come back, you should go.
If your father could have brought back their spring, what would he have done?
I think he'd have wanted their friendship.
If that's so, you must do likewise.
- Do you think the procession will help?
- You never know.
We'll see if the fountain responds to our prayers.
If it does, I'll have to go to confession.
That's the trouble:
if the water comes back, every fool might feel like you and I'll end up losing the election.
Miracles are very convincing.
Something's happening...
Stop!
It's gurgling!
There's a gurgling in the pipe.
A miracle!
On your knees!
On your knees, everybody!
It's not a miracle!
It's just a coincidence.
I recognised your footsteps.
Your ears are sharp.
My hearing can't replace my eyesight, Cesar.
Belly dancing's all very well, but you made a mistake in going to North Africa.
I did?
I say mistake, but it was almost a crime.
What mistake do you mean?
When I was wounded, I was about to be promoted.
That's not what I meant.
I'm talking about the letter you received.
- What letter?
- One that deserved an answer... but you failed to respond.
A letter from whom?
You don't want to talk to me about it because you think I don't know.
- I swear, Delphine.
- Don't swear, you sinner!
I'm sorry to be stirring up a bitter memory.
A bitter memory?
Delphine, we're beside the church, in the presence of the cross.
I swear by that cross that I received no letter except from my father, Anglade and Castagne.
If that's the truth, it's tragic.
Why?
Swear again that you're not lying to me.
I swear it.
Who wrote to me?
Florette.
Florette Camoins?
There was no other Florette.
Are you sure?
I gave the letter to the postman.
I'd never have forgotten a letter from her.
I still have two faded notes she wrote me... and one of her combs.
That's it.
When I came back, she'd left the village.
She'd married that blacksmith from Crespin.
She already had a child.
Is it possible her letter didn't reach you?
Over there we kept on moving around.
Sometimes we didn't get food or even ammunition.
It's definitely possible that letters got lost as well.
But if there'd been one from her
I'd know it by heart.
If that's true, it's dreadful!
- Do you think she loved me?
- You old fool!
She never admitted it... not even after what we did one night in Anglade's barn.
That's just the way she was.
But in her letter she wrote that she was pregnant.
- What?
- Yes.
You'd been gone three weeks.
She said that if you wrote to promise her father to marry her, she'd wait for you.
She'd have shown your letter to everybody so that no-one would laugh at her.
Are you sure?
The poor girl couldn't sleep.
She tried to get rid of the baby with magic potions.
She jumped from high rocks in the hills, but nothing worked.
She came to hate you.
She went to Aubagne, where she met that blacksmith from Crespin.
So she left the village and no-one ever knew when the child was born.
Was it alive?
Yes, alive.
But a hunchback.
I hear Clairette coming for me.
Come on over, girl.
It's getting chilly.
I want to sit by the fireside.
Adieu, Cesar.
Don't worry.
I've never told anyone.
I'll pray for you.
- What's wrong, Papet?
Are you ill?
- No, no.
Don't stay out here.
Come inside.
- Shall I call a doctor?
- No.
- I could call through to Ombrees.
- No.
I know what's wrong with me.
Lean on me.
I'll take you home.
My friend, I don't believe you're near death.
I believe I am.
I know I'm going to die tonight.
Why do you think so?
I'll die because I don't want to live.
Let's get on with the confession.
You can see I need to confess.
Remember, suicide is a cardinal sin.
I've no need to kill myself.
I'll simply let myself go.
Please God, don't let her baby be a hunchback.
Dear little Manon,
I am leaving you my whole estate.
You may wonder why, but it's the truth.
The solicitor will give you all the documents.
It's because your father was my son, the Soubeyran I'd hoped for all my life.
I tormented him to death because I didn't know who he was.
If I'd told him about the spring, he'd still be playing his harmonica and you'd all be living in our family home.
No-one knows about it, but even so, I'm bitterly ashamed.
In the village, there's one person who'll tell you the truth.
It's Delphine, the old blind woman.
She'll explain how it's all because of Africa.
I don't deserve to kiss you and I never dared to speak to you, but maybe now you can forgive me and even pray for poor Ugolin and me.
Even I find myself a pitiable being.
I think it was because of spite that I never went near him.
I never heard his voice or saw his face or his eyes, which might have been like his mother's.
All I saw was his hump and the grief I caused him.
You'll understand why I want to die.
I'm so hounded by my miserable thoughts that even hell will be a blessed release.
I'm not afraid to see him up there, now he knows he's a Soubeyran and it's not my fault he's a hunchback.
He realises it was all a foolish mistake.
I'm sure he won't resent me, but will even defend me.
Farewell, my darling girl.
Your grandfather, Cesar Soubeyran.
Next time I won't pay this much.
The competition from Italy is killing me.
This barely pays for the fertilizer.
Next year we'll grow chick-peas.
I'll miss having drinks with friends like you.
What's all this barking about?
I won't steal your herd.
Move over.
Leave me my bread!
Here, we'll share my lunch.
Well, now what will I eat?
Go on, move.
Bernard, what did you do today?
I explored the hill.
Look what I found.
Lignites.
This area is full of them.
Very interesting.
And I saw some unattended goats.
Must be the hunchback's daughter's herd.
I haven't seen the little savage since her dad died.
She hides from us.
I've seen her.
She's beautiful.
Her mother was a real beauty.
That hunchback hatched a lovely daughter.
Who was he?
You didn't know him.
It was before you moved here.
He was a city intellectual who played at being a farmer.
He was a nut.
He wasn't all that nutty.
I didn't say he was an idiot.
He just wasn't practical.
He tried breeding rabbits by multiplying numbers on paper.
Why?
Because he had no water.
But you found some.
Your carnations are doing well.
On holidays, mostly Christmas and Mardi Gras.
Easter is good too.
And the dead.
Aren't they good business?
Not bad.
Funerals bring good income.
Let's go.
Hurry up!
Thanks.
Here's a letter.
My darling...
Tonight we're doing Aida in Bordeaux.
I sing a small role, but I'm thrilled.
If only you were with me, I'd be truly happy.
Your loving mother.
You can't stay here forever.
You should go join your mother.
No hare or rabbit or partridge in sight.
Maybe I'm going deaf and blind.
Next time I'll bring the butcher's dog.
That hare won't get away!
Galinette!
Do you know it's five o'clock?
That's some nap.
I think I got sunstroke.
No, you're not red.
You must be needing sleep.
Come outside.
She can't hear, but she guesses everything.
What I'll say to you concerns only us two.
Galinette...
You're past 30, and you're the last of the Soubeyrans.
I know all that.
Don't interrupt!
If I keep saying it, it's your fault.
I'll say it until you understand.
We Soubeyrans were this region's most important family.
On Grandpa's birthday...
There were 30 of you.
All Soubeyrans, with cans of gold hidden throughout the house.
Everyone respected us.
It didn't last, but don't blame me.
That's fate.
There's no such thing as fate.
Good-for-nothings always blame fate!
It was the fault of our elders.
Because of pride and greed, they married among themselves.
Cousins married cousins.
An uncle married his niece.
That's bad for rabbits, and not good for people.
What's the result?
Two madwomen and three suicides.
Now there's only us two.
I don't count anymore.
So you're what's left of the Soubeyrans.
You want me to marry.
Why didn't you take a wife?
I wasn't cut out for it.
Mind you, I almost did... but it didn't work out.
I joined the army in Africa, on a whim... and when I came back...
If there had been a child, I'd gladly have married her.
But it didn't happen.
I'm like Anglade's cherry tree.
Many blossoms, but never any fruit.
So I should marry instead of you.
You have to, Galinette.
But why?
Why?
You're asking me why?
What about the Soubeyran fortune?
It's not banknotes that rats eat.
It's gold!
Cans full of gold coins.
Understand?
And I own them!
That's from savings, skimping and hard work.
You'd throw it all out?
Of course not.
I love gold.
Then don't leave it without an owner.
You can't ask me to start a family just like that.
I've asked you for ten years.
But not as seriously as today.
Besides, I have my own ideas.
You have someone in mind?
Maybe.
Won't you tell me who?
Listen, I was in the sun all day.
I feel woozy.
I'll tell you, but be patient.
Fine.
I like you, Galinette.
Just one more thing.
In choosing a wife, think of the children.
What do you mean?
Don't be enticed by a pretty face.
What we need is wide hips, long legs... and nice, big tits.
It's like choosing a brood mare.
What if she's also pretty?
If it's also, I won't mind.
On the contrary... she'd be the Soubeyran beauty.
I'd enjoy looking at her.
Over here, Noe!
Come!
Why is it always my turn?
The water is for everyone.
Cleaning the basin twice a year won't kill you.
This red sand and the dead leaves.
People need clean water.
So do vegetables.
This is strange.
Looks like clay, but it's not.
No... it's bauxite powder.
A mixture of iron and aluminum.
Where does it come from?
From the spring, after big storms.
It settles here... and never reaches the fountain.
After a rainy night... my spring water turns red and the stones look rusty.
It is rust, since it's iron oxide.
Then it can't hurt.
No.
It's actually good.
Where's your spring in relation to this basin?
What do you mean?
Is it higher up or below?
That's hard to say.
The Romarins valley is above here.
Then the village water comes from the same valley.
It's ten o'clock.
I promised they'd have water by noon!
That's two hours away.
But it takes an hour before it reaches the village.
I enjoy your company, but I must report to the mayor.
Don't keep him waiting, teacher.
Someone's throwing stones!
Wasn't that lightning?
You saw lightning?
You must have started drinking real early.
I swear I drank only coffee this morning.
That's my knife.
I lost it a few days ago.
- Around here?
- No.
I haven't been here before.
That's strange.
The shepherdess returned it to you.
- Where is she?
- What shepherdess?
- You mean Manon?
- The hunchback's Manon.
Who else?
Is she hiding here?
No, she ran away.
Too bad.
I wanted to thank her.
Some other time.
Thank her with a little kiss.
I don't know her, but I dreamt about her.
In my dream, I even kissed her.
Did she let you?
In my dreams, women don't resist me.
Aren't you eating?
I'm not hungry.
You haven't looked well lately.
I've lost my appetite.
Probably from that poison.
What poison?
The one I spray on my carnations... to kill the red spiders.
I'll do it for you.
No.
It has to be done at night.
Daylight is no good for it.
It weakens it.
It kills its effectiveness.
You work nights, but you don't sleep days.
You're never home.
What do you do all day?
I hunt.
I walk around on the hill.
I breathe in the fresh air... to clean out my lungs...
- from that poison.
- That's true.
It's good for the carnations, but bad for you.
Still, you should eat and sleep.
Want a doctor?
No.
I'll be all right.
See?
I'm eating.
She's going to Aubagne to sell my birds.
He's nuts.
Who is it?
It's me!
Yes, you're going crazy.
- Who is the woman?
- What woman?
The one you visit in Aubagne.
I've watched you for days.
You keep collecting birds.
What for?
I see you prancing and talking to yourself as if you're crazy!
Are you in love?
That's a good sickness.
Who is she?
You won't tell me.
Then she's either a tramp... or she's married.
That's it!
She's married!
She's married!
Open up!
No, I won't!
- We can talk through the door.
- Why?
If I don't see you, I might tell you.
You're as dopey as your poor mother.
Now, tell me.
I don't want to tell you anything.
Ask me questions.
Tell me who she is.
I won't tell you that.
A city girl?
Quite the opposite.
Even better.
Do I know her?
Actually, no.
What does that mean?
You're too clever.
After four questions, you'll know.
- Then...
I do know her.
- See?
I don't want to tell you.
You act like a cop, but I won't tell you.
Why not?
Because!
It's my secret.
My first love secret, and I'm keeping it.
Keep it.
I'm leaving.
Good-bye.
No!
Stay!
I want to talk about her.
I don't even know who she is.
But I do, so I like talking about her.
Papet, did you leave?
No.
I'm rolling a cigarette.
So, you want to marry her?
Yes, but she won't want me.
- Why?
- She's pretty and I'm ugly.
Does she have money?
Not much.
- Is she healthy?
- Yes.
She's strong as a horse and has good little muscles.
She would do a better job on my carnations than me.
And she's educated too.
How do you know?
She's always reading books.
Sometimes for a whole hour.
That's no good.
A poor girl who reads books.
I don't like it.
Besides, a beautiful wife could mean trouble.
Is she honest?
She's the Holy Virgin of the hills.
If she'd marry me, I'd be happy as a king.
But she won't.
No poor girl ever rejected a Soubeyran.
Unless she's crazy.
If she said yes, would you consent?
I can't say until I know who she is.
You idiot!
Open up and tell me!
I won't open the door!
I have to think!
Papet...
I may tell you, but first, swear by all the Soubeyrans... that when you hear her name, you won't say a word.
- As you like.
- No!
Swear it!
I swear it by all the Soubeyrans.
Good!
Now I have to decide.
I won't open the door.
I'll take out the key.
Put your ear next to the keyhole.
It's Manon, the hunchback's daughter.
Twenty years from now, you'll be too old for her.
- She'll have lovers.
- She wouldn't do that.
She's like all the others.
But never mind.
By then you'll have a house full of sturdy little Soubeyrans.
Since she's pretty, I give my consent.
You've seen her?
Yes, I have.
What's your opinion?
She's very pretty.
She seems mature for her age.
She must be 18 by now.
Know who she's like?
Nobody.
She looks like someone you never knew.
She looks exactly like her grandmother.
You knew her grandmother?
Florette Camoins... the beauty!
Miss, I'm glad to meet you... to thank you for my knife.
How did you know it was mine?
I saw you eating with it one day.
I'm the new teacher.
I'm collecting minerals in the hills... to teach my pupils the composition of their land.
There's no gold here.
It's Jurassic cretaceous from the second Quaternary era.
You're well-informed for a shepherdess.
I'm just quoting my dad.
I'd like you to keep this.
I've got one.
That one's too fancy for me.
No.
A shepherdess should have a shepherd's knife.
It has four blades, an awl and a nail file.
And small scissors.
I know, because I used them.
It's the first one I snared.
It's a baby.
The big ones get away.
That hare is my present to you.
My class starts soon.
I have to leave.
I'll leave this on a rock.
Someone is bound to find it.
She doesn't want your knife.
I'll keep it if you take the hare.
All right.
Thanks.
Papet...
How does one talk to girls?
I don't know any words of love.
So you've made up your mind?
Yes, I must hurry.
She could meet a man in Aubagne who might take her from me.
Where will you court her?
In the hills.
I'll pretend to look for mushrooms or snails... as if I didn't see her.
Not so fast.
If you're looking for mushrooms or snails... it makes you seem poor.
If you're rich, show it.
Don't wear your old clothes.
Wear a new suit, a real hunting outfit... with leather leggins and a matching hat.
And above all... wear suspenders.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a hare I shot that must be wounded.
Aren't you Manon, the daughter of Monsieur Jean?
I see you don't remember me.
That's because I've changed a lot.
I'm Ugolin... your poor father's friend.
You've changed too.
You're a real young lady.
I hardly recognize you.
You may wonder why we never met before.
I'm too busy to hunt because of my carnations.
Did you know I grow carnations?
I've been very successful.
I've earned lots of money.
The money's all in gold coins!
In two years, with my savings, I'll be worth 50,000 francs.
Would you like to move back to Romarins?
I'd stay in my Massacan house... and you and Baptistina can tend my carnations.
Manon, listen to me!
I know why you don't want to!
It's because you're proud.
But your pride is no problem.
Carnations need watering, picking, and women know all about that.
I'll pay you!
I'll pay you very well!
It isn't to have you work.
I was lying.
It's because I love you.
I love you with all my heart.
Manon!
I want to marry you!
I'm all alone.
I have no one!
My grandparents are dead!
My father hanged himself.
My mother died of the flu!
There's only Uncle Papet!
He's rich.
He's old!
He's going to die!
He'll leave it all to me, and it'll be yours!
Because I love you!
I love you!
My love for you is choking me... making me ill.
I saw you bathing in the water holes.
I watched for hours, you were so beautiful.
I was afraid I'd commit a crime!
- You spoke to her?
- I didn't see her.
She must have gone to Aubagne.
Then do it tomorrow.
Maybe.
First I've got to get used to this outfit.
You look great!
Like a hunter from Marseilles.
Look!
Do you see what I see?
A beautiful thrush.
That trap must belong to the hunchback's daughter.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
That is her herd.
She must be around here.
I won't touch it.
Other people's traps are sacred.
Especially hers.
That's her only livelihood.
She sells them at the Aubagne market.
She's proud.
We've already hurt her enough.
We didn't mean to.
We're not responsible.
We're all responsible.
We knew there was a spring at Romarins, but we said nothing.
Why didn't you speak up?
Because of Amelie.
- You want a bite?
- I sure do.
When I used to hunt at Romarins, I'd see... that poor hunchback look for water with his rod.
Once he was right above it, but the rod didn't bend.
Then he dug in the wrong spot.
That night I was upset... so I told Amelie.
What a scene!
She flew into a rage!
It was none of our business...
hunchbacks are bad luck... he was an outsider from Crespin, etc., etc.
You know how she is.
She made me swear to say nothing.
- So you didn't?
- No.
Ugolin and Papet are real bastards.
In that whole business, we were all bastards.
Papet!
My spring stopped running!
- What?
- No water!
None at all!
I dug down deep.
Not a drop!
Now what?
The carnations are budding!
- 15,000 of them.
- The well!
The well will be empty in two days.
Springs are capricious, especially yours.
- Give it three months.
- Three months!
Holy Mother!
Stop it, you fool!
The water is probably back by now.
And if not, with a few mules, we can hold out.
Let's take a look.
It used to flow.
When the hunchback came, it stopped.
Listen!
Something's wrong with our fountain.
It's just trickling.
Come and see!
That's not possible.
Here too!
Papet, we're ruined!
Calm down!
You see?
Could be a frog or a snake inside.
We're stuck, like Ugolin.
Impossible!
It hasn't stopped running in 50 years.
I'll go check out the basin.
Nothing!
I'm on my way.
Don't worry!
Monsieur Jean, have mercy.
You're up in heaven, so you can see... that my feet are so swollen that I can't wear shoes... that my mule is half-dead.
If this goes on, my carnations are ruined in eight days.
Come on.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost... give us back your daughter's spring.
Amen.
Help us!
Amen, damn it!
Yes, I'm the mayor.
When will you get here?
Tomorrow?
We'll all be dead!
He must come right away!
We have no bread.
Our crops are ruined.
It's a disaster!
Then I'll expect him tomorrow at the town hall.
The expert is coming tomorrow.
- What expert?
- The one I keep asking for!
The rural engineering expert.
The meeting will come to order.
This council meeting concerns the water problem.
Problem?
It's a disaster!
That's right, a disaster.
But thanks to my own efforts and my telephone...
I was able to get us a rural expert.
And here is the rural expert.
Gentlemen...
I have studied your problem... and here's the report I'm submitting to my chief.
Partridge Spring that fed your fountain... was the main source for this whole region.
It originated from a fissure between two layers of limestone.
The source is not diaclastic.
It is a Vauclusian resurgence.
Let's not confuse the two.
Thus, the water bed between two impervious strata leveled out... and the water issued forth along the upper stratum, under pressure.
This trapped pool supplied your basin by rising up... and the basin supplied your fountain through a series of pipes.
Yes, it's serious!
At the request of your mayor... and the administration... we researched the cause of this terrible accident.
First, where did your water originate?
Luckily we have this document.
Very interesting!
It's a study by the chief engineer... that spells out, clearly and to the point... some experiments made in this region five years ago.
Unfortunately, your spring does not appear on this valuable map... because it's not in the orography of the Huveaune River... or its tributaries.
Where does that leave us?
Since the water doesn't originate locally, it comes from far away.
I want to speak.
- Not now!
- I'll make it short!
Just let him turn on the water!
He can explain later!
I don't fix fountains.
The first theory is the drought.
A small drop in the ground water level may have caused your problem.
As the rising water is diverted by the parallel series of dolomites... and finally the Jurassic pattern... it should get through via a network of syphons.
You know what that is?
It's a rubber tube to draw wine.
Exactly.
At the first rain, the syphons are re-primed... as soon as the underground lake rises to its normal level.
An underground lake?
Of course!
And don't argue with progress.
You could be wrong.
If progress returns me my water, I'm for it!
And if my spring flows again, here's my 100 francs for progress!
Wait and hear the rest of this bullshit.
Now, the second theory.
The underground stream dropped into a network of caves.
Once they're filled... the water returns to its old level and the spring flows again.
How soon?
I can't tell you how long it might take.
Maybe two days... maybe two years.
Maybe 100 years.
That can't be ruled out.
Third theory...
To hell with your theories!
What can you do for us right now?
The administration will provide a daily truck with 1,300 gallons of water.
To cover your immediate daily needs.
How much water do I get for my carnations?
If our water hasn't returned in a month, what then?
We suggest you farm some land elsewhere.
What can I say?
Lots of villages have plenty of water.
No, sir... our council can't accept that!
Your council's power over natural phenomena is next to zero.
The third theory...
To hell with their theories!
We've got some administration!
And I say to hell with you!
You'll have to manage with the water truck.
It will be here in two days.
Meanwhile, gentlemen, good-bye!
Quiet!
Or else they'll send the police!
Where is he?
Where's the president of the Water Syndicate?
Who is the president?
It's not me, it's you!
I am because I'm the mayor, and that's because I have a phone!
And what is this?
- Your receipt.
- Right.
Fifty-two francs, plus the stamp.
You took my money.
Now where's my water?
Before you came, the expert explained about the orography.
You have to understand orography.
I don't give a damn!
I paid and I want my water!
Listen, they're sending a water truck every day.
Bring your mule... and you'll get 40 gallons like the rest of us.
One:
I have no mule, just a donkey.
Two: 40 gallons will do for a cafe, not for a field.
Three:
I paid for spring water, not truck water!
I'm sure they'll send spring water.
Not from my spring!
I paid and I want my water!
Stop yelling!
It's exhausting us and it won't help!
Holy Mother!
My poor eggplants.
My 600 beefsteak tomato plants!
But everyone is affected.
It's a major disaster.
Major, hell!
I paid and I want my water!
The spring stopped running.
Where should we get water?
Who cares?
Just make it run from my pipe.
And you, mind your own business!
You're a councilman, but I didn't vote for you!
- I don't need your vote.
- You pain in the ass!
Where do you think you are?
Surrounded by water thieves!
Good morning.
Today is my birthday.
After Mass you're invited for a drink.
We don't control what day we're born.
My brothers, I am truly glad... to see you all gathered in our little church.
The whole parish is here... including a group of intellectuals... who normally observe Holy Mass on the terrace of a coffee house.
I won't name it.
It's our only coffee house.
I won't name them either.
You all know them.
This ought to fill them with shame... were it not for their cynicism.
With clasped hands and moist eyes... you're full of faith and repentance today.
But God knows you're here because your spring stopped running... and your prayers are merely pleas for your string beans... orations for your tomatoes, hallelujahs for your artichokes... hosannas for your squash!
I must speak seriously about the spring.
I keep asking myself the same question.
Why is it... that this water, so plentiful until now... has suddenly dried up in the hour of our need?
I once read a Greek tragedy about the city of Thebes... that was struck by a calamitous plague... because of crimes committed by its king.
So I ask myself...
"Is there a criminal among us?"
It's not impossible... since the biggest crimes often escape human justice.
But God knows of them all!
I'll now speak to this unknown criminal, if he exists.
To him I say...
"My brother... there's no sin that cannot be forgiven... no crime that can't be atoned for... by sincere repentance"
Our Lord, Jesus Christ, said this astounding phrase:
"There is more room in heaven for one repentant sinner."
Whatever your offense, try to make amends.
Repent, and you shall be saved.
And your spring will flow better than before.
Papet.
He knows.
He looked at me three times.
What could he know?
He's only been here a year.
Maybe somebody told him in confession.
Anglade might have.
He's such a bigot that he might confess other people's sins.
What worries me is the girl.
Me too.
She seemed unfriendly to you.
She seemed to be saying, "You're the criminal."
No.
She knows nothing either.
Then what worries you?
I think she doesn't want you.
To our teacher's good health!
Here's to you!
What did you think of the sermon?
What do you expect?
It's just a lot of words.
I'm sure no act of God dried up the spring.
He seemed to allude to a crime he knew of.
Maybe he heard of it in confession and couldn't reveal more.
What crime?
If anyone here commits a crime, we'd all know.
No, I felt he had someone in mind.
- Then who?
- Yes, who?
He kept looking at Ugolin.
Yes, especially when he spoke of the plague.
- I'm a plague?
- Don't joke about such things.
You smelled our Pernod!
I came because of the water, not the Pernod.
I have to speak to you.
It's very important.
- To me?
- Yes.
You can bring our water back.
I could?
How?
By coming to the procession.
Will you?
Then our fountain won't ever flow again.
You think she's a saint?
An orphan's prayer... soars to heaven like a lark.
Our Lord will gladly listen to her song.
She's innocent.
If she prays for us, we're saved.
Manon, you must save our carnations!
I won't help those who stole my father's water!
I don't understand.
They understand!
They know why God is punishing them.
Tell us.
Do you know who the criminal is?
There are two.
There they are!
If we're treated like criminals, I'd rather go home.
Come, Galinette.
Your hurried departure might make us think...
I don't care what you think!
I think for myself.
Let's go.
- Come on!
- No.
I want to hear what she's accusing me of... because I can solve the whole problem.
Tell me how they stole your father's water.
But she's imagining things!
It's true her father's lack of water may have ruined him.
He would have found water, except for his accidental death.
The two women were in trouble... so we bought the little farmland.
Partly because we liked it, true.
But also to help them out!
Later we searched for the spring and, by sheer luck, we found it.
That's what she calls stealing his water.
"Help thy neighbor." Some joke!
Let's go!
He's lying!
The truth is the spring was always there.
The truth is you blocked it off.
Why would they do that?
To buy it cheap.
Without water, the farm is worthless.
My father's dead, thanks to these assassins!
That's not true!
That's slander!
I found that spring with my watch.
You were there with your mother.
You held a squash.
Tell the truth!
Within less than an hour?
God said to Pascal:
"You wouldn't look for me... unless you'd already found me."
To hell with Pascal!
I only met him once.
He was so rude, I slapped him!
You laugh, but it's true.
Here's what we have.
She denies what she saw and believes what she didn't see.
Who saw us block up that spring?
Who saw us block up that spring?
Me.
I saw you.
I saw you both!
Liar!
What did you see, idiot?
You never knew left from right.
In the army, they put an "X" on his left hand.
He never understood, so they sent him home.
I planned it that way.
It wasn't easy, but it worked.
The major had his suspicions.
We're not interested in that.
Tell us what you saw.
He saw nothing.
- He was dreaming.
- I never dream!
It was nine or ten years ago.
See?
He's being vague.
It was after Bouffigue died.
It was at Romarins, hunting partridge.
They were drinking from a puddle near the empty farmhouse.
I picked the lock, went upstairs...
How nice!
Breaking into a dead man's house.
Bouffigue built two small windows under the gutter to shoot thrush.
First, I took a nap.
You see, he slept!
He was dreaming!
That was no dream!
Suddenly I heard digging sounds and woke up.
I watched through the window...
This one was digging.
The other watched.
I didn't dare move.
The water gushed out of the hole... then they blocked the spring with cement.
Why didn't you tell her father?
It wasn't my business.
But now God is punishing them and us.
Now it is my business.
Suppose he's telling the truth.
It's not true, but if it were...
I'm willing to give her the spring, my carnations... the farm, the money, the Soubeyran fortune... my life.
You know it.
I told you so in the hills.
I love you more than anything.
Listen.
Listen to me, Manon.
I see you and talk to you constantly.
I can't eat.
I can't sleep.
If you don't want me, I'll die or go crazy.
Shut up, idiot.
Let's go.
Just think about it.
What a terrible mixture... between my remorse... and the happiness I'd like to bring you.
Don't you know how I'll slave for you, my love?
Make him go away!
My love!
Don't be a fool.
Get up.
Think, Manon!
Just think.
I'll die over this love, and nobody'll care.
Galinette, come on home.
No!
It's all your fault!
I lost everything because of you!
If I had known...
Galinette, my boy!
I'll stay.
Since you're all against him, I'll defend him.
That won't be easy.
You all know there never was a spring at Romarins... just a puddle.
But I found the real spring!
Those of you who are natives like me... admit that there was no spring.
Listen carefully.
If you knew of a spring and didn't tell the hunchback... then you're responsible for his death.
The old bastard!
- You knew?
- Sure.
We all knew.
We didn't dare denounce them to defend an outsider.
He hated my grandmother.
They took it out on her son.
Who's your grandmother?
Florette.
They never forgave her for marrying a man from Crespin.
Florette was your grandmother?
The hunchback was Florette's son?
Papet wants to see you and the mayor.
He wants to see you too.
- Me?
- He said to hurry.
- He said you'll be glad.
- Where is he?
At Romarins.
What's wrong?
Put him on the table.
Right there.
Go tell the deaf one... to bring some candles from the church.
At least six big ones.
And the linen sheet his grandmother wove.
Pamphile, prepare the coffin.
You have the oak boards in the attic.
The ones I wanted for myself.
I know.
You're the one who ordered them.
Use them for him.
The rest of you, please... say he fell from a tree.
Keep this a secret... for three days... or the priest won't give him a proper burial.
Now you can leave.
I'm staying with you.
There's no need to.
She should have married him... and gotten her revenge by driving him crazy.
Papet, I'm leaving because I can't go on.
It's not the carnations.
It's because of my love.
I realize she'll never want me.
I suspected it because her ribbon burned my flesh.
And when I told her in public I wanted to marry her... she spat at me in a fury.
What's more, she fled towards the teacher.
When he talks to her, she lowers her eyes.
When he stops, she lingers until he continues.
And he takes her love for granted.
He's unaware of his happiness, but I know my misery.
I can't stand it.
I'd like to kill him.
But it would hurt her, and I'd never hurt her.
I leave her my farm and all that's hidden... you know where...
to the left of the fireplace.
Don't make any trouble.
It's not her fault or yours.
It's fate.
Arrange a Mass for me, because up there...
I'll have to explain about the spring.
Adieu, my Papet.
I'm sorry to leave you, but I can't stay.
You know?
I know.
What will you do?
I don't know.
I won't go back to that house.
Too many bad memories.
I'd keep seeing him hang where my swing used to be... and smell his odor in the house.
Will you join the procession?
If you're sure... that the water won't come back, you should go.
If your father could bring back the spring... what would he do?
He'd have liked to be their friend.
For his sake, do what he would have done.
You think this procession will help?
You never know.
I wonder how I would feel if the prayers worked.
I would feel forced to go to confession.
That's what worries me.
I know several fools who'd think like you... and I'd surely lose the elections.
Miracles can be very convincing.
Something's happening!
Stop!
It's breathing.
The pipe is blowing.
A miracle!
Kneel!
On your knees!
Kneel down, everybody!
It's not a miracle!
It's just a coincidence!
I recognized your footsteps.
Your ear is as sharp as an eye.
Ears can't replace eyes, Cesar.
Belly dancing is all very well... but you made a mistake when you were over there.
I did?
I said "mistake," but it was almost a crime.
I don't know what mistake you mean.
When I was wounded, they almost promoted me.
That's something else.
I'm talking about a letter you received.
What letter?
One that deserved an answer.
An answer that you never sent.
A letter from whom?
You don't want to tell me... because you think I don't know.
- I swear, Delphine!
- Don't swear, you sinner!
I'm sorry for reminding you of something unpleasant.
What is unpleasant?
From here I see the church... and a cross on top of the steeple.
I swear on that cross that I received no letter... except from my father and Anglade.
In that case, it's a tragedy.
Why?
Swear again that you're not lying to me.
I swear it.
Who wrote to me?
Florette.
Florette Camoins?
There was no other Florette.
Are you sure?
I, myself, gave the letter to the mailman.
I'd never have forgotten a letter from her.
I still have two faded notes she wrote to me... and a black comb from her hair.
It's true.
When I came back, she had left the village.
She was married to the blacksmith in Crespin... and she already had a child.
How could that letter have gotten lost?
Over there, we moved from place to place.
Sometimes our food and even our ammunition didn't reach us.
Some letters may have been lost too.
But if I had received that letter...
I would still know it by heart.
If that's true, it's dreadful.
You think she loved me?
You old fool.
She never told me so... not even after what happened between us one night... in Anglade's barn.
That's how she was.
In her letter... she told you that she was pregnant.
What?
Yes.
You had left three weeks before.
She told you if you wrote to her father... promising to marry her... she would wait for you.
She could have shown her letter to the whole village... and nobody would have dreamed of making fun of her.
Are you sure?
The poor girl couldn't sleep.
She tried to lose the baby with devilish potions.
She jumped from high rocks in the hills... but nothing worked.
Then she started hating you.
She went to the dance at Aubagne... where she found the blacksmith from Crespin.
So she left the village... and no one ever knew when the child was born.
Was it born alive?
Alive, yes... but it was a hunchback.
I hear Clarinette coming back.
Come on over, my girl.
It's getting chilly.
I'd rather sit by the fireplace.
Adieu, Cesar.
Don't worry.
I never told anyone.
I'm going to pray for you.
What's wrong, Papet?
Are you ill?
Don't stand here.
It's too cold.
Should I call a doctor?
I could call at the Ombres.
No, thanks.
I know what's wrong with me.
Lean on me.
I'll take you home.
My friend, I don't believe you are about to die.
But I believe I am.
I know I'll die tonight.
What makes you think so?
I'll die because I no longer want to live.
Hurry and confess me.
You'll see.
I have lots to confess.
You know that suicide is a mortal sin.
I won't need to kill myself.
I'll simply pass away.
Dear God, please don't let her baby be a hunchback.
Dear little Manon... the notary will tell you that I'm leaving you my whole estate.
It may surprise you, but it's the truth.
The notary will give you all the documents.
Because your father was my son.
He was the Soubeyran I'd hoped for all my life... whom I tormented to death... because I didn't know who he was.
If I had told him about the spring... he'd still be playing his harmonica... and you'd all be living in our family home.
No one knows it, but I'm too ashamed to face anyone... even the trees.
In the village, there's a person who knows.
She will tell you everything.
It's Delphine, the old blind woman.
She'll explain that it's all because of Africa.
I don't deserve to kiss you... and I never dared speak to you.
But maybe now you can forgive me... and even say a little prayer... for poor Ugolin and me.
I'm so pathetic, I even pity myself.
Out of sheer spite, I never went near him.
I never knew his voice or his face.
I never saw his eyes... that might have been like his mother's.
I only saw his hump and the pain I caused him.
Now you understand why I want to die.
Because next to my torments... even hell would be a pleasure.
Besides, I'll see him up there.
I'm not afraid of him.
Now he knows he's a Soubeyran... and it's not my fault that he's a hunchback.
He knows it was all a foolish mistake.
I'm sure that instead of blaming me... he'll defend me.
Farewell, my darling girl.
Your grandfather, Cesar Soubeyran.

Voila.
Next time I won't pay this price.
With the competition from Italy I'll be ruined.
The price you give us, barely pays for the fertilizer.
Next year we'll go back to growing chick-peas.
My only regret will be: no more drinking with friends like you.
What's the matter with you, barking like that?
I won't steal your flock.
Allez, scoot over.
Do you mind?
Leave my bread alone!
Let's share a little snack, huh?
Hey, what this?
What'll I eat, then?
☻
Allez, move.
- Messieurs!
- Bonjour!
Bernard, what did you do today?
This morning, I had a long hike the hills.
Look what I found.
Lignite.
This massif is full of them.
Very interesting.
I also saw an unattended flock.
Must belong to the hunchback's daughter.
The wild child?
Haven't seen her since her father's death.
- You'd think she's hiding from us.
- I've seen her.
She's lovely.
Takes after her mother.
She was a real beauty, too.
He may have been a hunchback but he made a lovely daughter.
Who was this hunchback?
You didn't know him, M. Belloiseau.
You hadn't retired here yet.
He was a city intellectual slumming as a farmer.
He was gaga.
Not so 'gaga' as all that.
By 'gaga', I don't mean imbecile.
I mean, impractical.
He thought he could breed thousands of rabbits by doing multiplications on paper.
Why not?
Wasn't there any water at Romarin?
You found some.
How are your carnations doing?
The holidays are more profitable, the best is Christmas, then Mardi Gras.
And Easter, too, is good.
And the dead?
Are the dead profitable?
Not bad.
Funerals can be quite profitable.
Hm!
Allez, allez, allez!
Allez!
Allez, allez, allez!
Get in.
Hurry up!
Grazie. (Thanks.

Una lettera. (A letter)
My dear little one,
Tonight we're doing 'Aida' at the Bordeaux Opera House.
I have a very small role, but I'm so pleased.
If you were with me, I'd be almost happy.
Your loving mother.
You can't stay here, forever.
You should go join your mama.
No hares, no rabbits, no partridges.
I wonder where they're hiding.
Or else, I'm going deaf and blind.
Next time, I'll bring the baker's basset hound.
Oh, I'll get that hare!
Galinette!
Do you know it's five o'clock?
That's some siesta!
I wonder if I got a touch of sunstroke.
No, you're not red.
You must be sleep deprived.
Come outside.
She can't hear a thing, but she guesses all.
What I have to say concerns only the two of us.
Galinette...
You're over 30 years old, and the last of the Soubeyrans.
- I see where you're going...
- Let me speak!
If I sound like a broken record, it's your own fault.
I'll keep it up until you understand.
We, Soubeyrans, were the greatest family in the region.
- On Grandpa's birthday...
- There were 30 of you.
All Soubeyrans, with pots of gold hidden throughout the house.
People took notice of us.
If it didn't last, it's not my fault.
It's destiny.
Not true, destiny doesn't exist!
Only good-for-nothings blame destiny!
What happened was our elders' fault.
Partly pride, partly not to separate the family money.
So they married among themselves.
Cousins with cousins.
Even uncles with nieces.
It's bad for rabbits, and it's no good for people.
And where did it get us?
Two madwomen and 3 suicides, that's what!
And now, here we are: two of us.
I don't count anymore.
Now, 'the Soubeyrans', is you.
So, you're demanding, again that I get married.
Why didn't you take a wife?
It wasn't in my character.
I thought about it, mind you... but it didn't work out.
I left to be a soldier in Africa, on a whim, like that.
And when I came back...
You know, if she'd borne a child, I'd have married her on the spot.
Only, that didn't happen.
I was like Anglade's lovely cherry tree.
The one that's always in bloom, but never bears fruit.
You want me to marry in your stead.
You must, Galinette.
But why, eh?
Why?
Why?
You're asking why?
!
What about the treasure?
You'd let the Soubeyran treasure die?
It's not in banknotes, for rats to chew.
It's gold!
Gold coins.
Jarfuls of gold coins.
You know what that means?
And I have them!
That's from economising, privation, hard work.
That's what you wanna throw away?
'Course not.
I love gold.
Since you love it, you wouldn't leave it without a master!
Papet, you're dreaming.
You can't restore a family just like that.
It's ten years, I've been telling you!
Yeah, but not as seriously as today.
Besides, I wish you'd let me choose according to my own mind.
You have someone in mind?
Maybe.
Won't you tell me who it is?
Look, Papet, I had the sun beating on my head all day.
I'm feeling kinda dopey.
I will tell you, but be patient.
All right.
I like you, Galinette.
I just ask one thing.
When choosing a wife, think of the children.
What do you mean?
Don't swoon over a pretty face.
What we need are large hips, long legs, nice, big titties.
Choose her like you would a brood mare.
What if she has pretty face, to boot?
Ah, if it's an extra...
I don't mind; on the contrary.
She'd be the 'Belle of the Soubeyrans'.
It'd be a pleasure to look at her.
Allez!
Allez!
Noe!
C'mere, Noe!
Come!
Always the same few guys doing this work, yet everyone uses the water.
This is your first time!
Cleaning the basin every 6 months won't kill you.
With all this wind blown red sand and leaves, if you want clean water, you gotta do this.
Vegetables, too, need clean water.
It doesn't clump.
It has the color of clay, but it's not clay.
No... it's bauxite sludge.
A mineral containing iron and aluminum.
I wonder where it comes from.
From the spring, during heavy storms, and for 7 or 8 hours after.
But it never reaches the fountain, it deposits here.
When it rains all night, the next morning, my spring turns red.
Looks like rust on the stones.
In fact it is rust: iron oxide.
- Then, it can't hurt.
- On the contrary, it's good.
Where's your spring relative to this catchment basin?
How do you mean, 'relative'?
Is it higher or lower?
That's hard to say.
I figure the Romarins valley is higher.
Then the village water comes from there, since it crosses the same mineral deposit.
- It's ten o'clock.
- Oh, dang...
- I promised them water by noon!
- So?
It's nowhere near noon!
The water takes an hour to reach the village.
C'mon, move it!
Messieurs, your company is very agreeable, but duty calls me to Town Hall.
Mustn't keep the mayor waiting, prof*.
Hey, hey!
Someone's throwing stones!
I thought I saw a little flash of lightning!
Ayi ayi-ayi, lightning at 10:
AM?
!
You're hitting the sauce early!
I swear, on my parents' grave, I only had coffee.
It's my knife.
I lost it in the hills a few days ago.
- Around here?
- No... first time I've been to this valley.
That's strange.
Must be the shepherdess who returned it to you.
- Where is she?
- What shepherdess?
- You mean Manon?
- Manon of the hunchback.
Who else?
- You think she's hiding up there?
- She's run off, by now!
- Too bad.
I'd like to thank her.
- Some other time.
That's nice, give her a little kiss.
Odd, but after all the talk about her, without knowing her, I dreamt about her.
I even kissed her.
And she let you?
In my dreams, women rarely resist me.
What, not eating?
I'm not hungry.
Galinette, you've lost your healthy glow, recently.
Well, I lost my appetite.
Must be on account of that poison.
What poison?
The one I spray on the carnations to protect them from red spiders.
- I'll do it, if you want.
- No.
It can only be done at night.
This product shuns the light of day.
Light wrecks it.
Kills all its nastiness.
You work at night, but you don't sleep in the day.
I came to see you several days.
You're never home.
What do you do?
I hunt.
I walk in the hills.
I breathe the fresh air.
To clean out my lungs.
- That poison irritates them.
- That's true.
It's good for carnations, but not for you.
So, you need to eat and sleep.
Wanna see a doctor?
No, Papet.
I'll be all right.
See?
I'm eating.
She's going to Aubagne to sell my thrushes.
He's gone gaga.
Aargh!
- Who is it?
- It's me!
YOU're the one who's gone gaga.
Who's the WOMAN?
- What woman?
- The woman you visit in Aubagne.
I've been observing you for some days.
I see you trap birds, what do you do with them?
I see you prancing and talking to yourself.
Have you gone gaga?
Are you in love?
Oh, that's a GOOD sickness!
So, tell me who she is.
Don't wanna tell me?
Then she must not be a very nice girl... or a married woman.
Yes, yes!
She's married!
She's married!
She's married!
- Open up, imbecile!
- No, I won't!
- We can talk through the door.
- Why?
Because if I can't see you, I might tell you something.
You're as big a dope as your poor father.
So, what do you wanna tell me?
I don't wanna tell you anything.
You're forcing me.
Go ahead, ask me some questions.
Well, tell me who she is.
No, I won't tell you.
Is she a city girl?
Quite the contrary.
So much the better.
Do I know her?
No, so to speak.
- What do you mean, so to speak?
- Because, you're too cunning.
In 3 or 4 questions, you'll guess.
So, I'm not saying!
- Then, I DO know her.
- See?
I don't wanna tell you.
And you grill me like a gendarme.
No, I won't tell you!
- Why not?
- Because!
It's my secret.
My first love secret, and I'm keeping it.
Fine, keep it.
I'm leaving.
Good-bye.
No, Papet, stay!
I want to talk about her.
I'm not interested, if I don't know who she is.
Yes, but I know, and I'd like to talk.
Papet, did you leave?
No, I'm rolling a cigarette.
So, you wanna marry this woman?
Oh, yes, I'd love that, but she wouldn't.
- Why?
- She's pretty and I'm ugly.
Does she have money?
Not much.
- Is she in good health?
- Oh, yes, Papet!
She's as strong as a horse, with lovely little muscles.
I've seen her work.
She could hoe my carnations better than me.
Besides that, she's educated.
How do you know?
She's always reading books.
Sometimes an hour at a stretch.
Oh, that's no good.
A poor girl who reads books.
I don't like it much.
Besides, a wife who's too pretty isn't always wise choice.
You think she's an honest girl?
Oh, yeah, Papet!
She's the Holy Virgin of the Woods.
If she'd say 'I do', it'd be wonderful.
I'd be as happy as a king.
But she won't.
No poor girl, has ever refused a Soubeyran.
She'd have to be completely crazy.
Papet, if she said yes, would you be agreeable?
I can't say yes without knowing who!
Come on, imbecile, open the door and tell me!
No!
I won't open the door.
I need to reflect.
- Papet?
- Oh.
I think I may tell you.
But you must, swear on the heads of all the Soubeyrans that once you know her name, you'll leave without a word.
- As you wish.
- No, no, swear!
Swear by all the Soubeyrans.
I swear on the heads of all the Soubeyrans.
Good.
Now, I just need to work up the nerve.
I'm not opening the door, eh?
I'm just removing the key.
Papet... put your ear to the keyhole.
It's Manon, the hunchback's daughter.
Allez!
Allez-allez-allez-allez!
Allez!
Allez!
Perhaps in 20 years, she'll find you too old.
- She'll have admirers.
- You don't know.
A girl like her!
"A girl like her" is like all the other girls.
Anyway, what does it matter?
In 20 years... the little Soubeyrans will be done.
And beautifully done, too!
Because she's a beauty.
And I consent.
- You've seen her?
- Oh yeah, I've seen her.
What do you think?
A beauty, I told you.
She seems older than her age.
She must be, at least, 18.
- You know who she looks like?
- Like nobody else!
Oh, yes.
Like someone you never knew.
The spitting image of her grandmother.
You knew her grandmother?
Florette Camoins... the beauty!
Mademoiselle, pleased to meet you.
I want to thank you for returning my knife.
How did you know it was mine?
I saw you eating, under the tree, the other day.
I'm the new school instructor.
I'm gathering a collection of minerals from these hills, to teach my pupils the composition of their native land.
I thought you were prospecting for gold.
This is Jurassic cretaceous, from the second Quaternary epoch.
You're quite knowledgeable for a shepherdess.
Just repeating my father's words.
It'd please me, no end, if you accepted this.
I've got one.
- Anyway, it's too fancy for me.
- Not at all.
A shepherd's knife isn't too fancy for a shepherdess.
It has four blades, an awl and a nail file.
And a pair of scissors.
I know, because I used them.
It's the first one I snared.
Only because it's young.
The big ones run off, snare and all.
That hare is MY offering to you.
Here...
My class starts at 1:30.
I'm off.
I'll leave this on a rock.
Someone would certainly be pleased to find it.
She wants nothing to do with your knife.
Monsieur!
I'll take the knife if you take the hare.
- All right.
Merci.
Tell me, Papet...
Hm.
How does a guy talk to girls?
I don't know any words of love.
So, you've finally decided?
Yes, gotta start as soon as possible.
Because, from time to time, she goes to Aubagne.
And a beauty like her, will be snapped up in no time.
- First of all, where will you court her?
- In the hills.
I'll pretend to be gathering snails or mushrooms, as if hadn't noticed her.
Not so fast!
It's no good to be collecting mushrooms or snails.
Makes you look poor!
If you're rich, you gotta show it.
And don't present yourself in your two bit clothes.
Wear a new suit, and 'visibly' new.
A proper hunting outfit, with leather leggings and matching hat.
And above all... suspenders.
Pardon.
Excuse my intrusion.
I'm looking for a hare I shot at.
I'm sure it's wounded.
Are you, by any chance, little Manon?
The daughter of poor Monsieur Jean?
I see you don't remember me.
Naturally, because I've changed a lot.
I'm Ugolin... your unfortunate father's friend.
You've changed too.
You've become a right proper demoiselle.
Gotta look carefully to recognize you.
You may wonder why we've never run into each other, in these hills.
These days I have no time to hunt on account of my carnations.
Did you know I grow carnations?
Imagine how successful, I've been.
I've made money, lots of money.
All in gold coins; well hidden!
In two years, my savings, will be worth 50,000 francs.
Do you think you'd like to return to Romarins?
I could stay in my house at Massacan, and you and Baptistine could keep an eye on my carnations.
Hey, Manon, listen to me!
I know why you don't want to!
Because you're proud.
But we can work around your pride.
Carnations need to be watered and gathered.
Women can do that.
I'll pay you!
I'll pay you pretty well.
Manon!
MANON!
Manon!
It's not about offering you work.
I lied.
It's because I love you.
I love you, Manon, with true love.
Manon!
I wanna marry you, I'm all alone.
Dying of loneliness.
My grandfather's dead.
My grandmother's dead.
My father hanged himself.
My mother died of the flu.
All I have is Papet.
He's rich.
He's old.
He'll croak soon!
He'll leave it all to me, and it'll all be yours.
Because I love you.
I love you!
I love you.
I can't breathe.
It's making me ill.
I saw you bathing in the rain puddles.
I watched you a long time, you were so beautiful.
I was afraid I'd commit a crime!
- So, did you speak to her?
- I didn't see her.
Must've gone to Aubagne to sell her game birds.
- Ah!
- Well, tomorrow, then.
- We'll see.
First, I have to get used to this outfit.
You look superb!
Like a hunter from Marseilles!
- Oh, look!
You see what I see?
- What a lovely thrush!
This trap must belong to the hunchback's daughter.
- Think so?
- Sure.
See, what'd I tell you?
That must be her herd.
She can't be far.
Other people's traps are sacred.
I never touch them.
Especially hers.
It's all she has to live on, poor girl.
She sells thrushes at the Aubagne market.
She's a proud one!
We've done enough harm to her, as it is.
Without meaning to!
We're not responsible.
We're all responsible.
The whole village knew there was a spring at Romarins.
- No one said anything.
- Why didn't you?
Because of Amelie.
- Wanna eat something?
- I'd never refuse that.
Some mornings I'd go hunting around Romarins.
And I'd see that poor hunchback looking for water with his rod.
Once, he was right on top of it, but the rod didn't dip.
Later on, I saw him dig in the wrong spot.
That night it bothered me.
I mentioned it to Amelie.
Oh, my word, what a terrible scene!
"It's shameful to mind other people's business;
"hunchbacks bring bad luck;
"he was an outsider from Crespin;
bla-bla-bla, etcetera, etcetera."
Well, you know my wife.
She made me swear to say nothing.
- So you didn't?
- No.
Ugolin and Papet are first class bastards.
Yep, in that regard, we're all bastards.
Aahh!
Aahh!
Aahh!
- PAPET!
- Oh!
- My spring's stopped!
- What's this nonsense?
- It's not running!
- At all?
- Not a drop!
I dug out the trench...
Nothing!
What'll we do?
My carnations are budding!
- He planted 15,000.
- You have the cistern.
The cistern will be empty in two days!
Springs are capricious, especially his.
Don't worry.
- In 3 months it'll come back.
- 3 months?
!
Holy Mother of God!
That's enough!
Get up, you imbecile!
The water may be back, as we speak.
If not, with 2 mules, 4, if need be, we can hold out.
Let's go look.
It flowed, before.
But, when the hunchback came, it stopped.
Then...
Hey guys, our fountain's drying up!
It's barely a trickle.
Come see!
- That's not possible.
- What's going on?
Here too, Papet, we're screwed!
Calm down!
Well?
- Maybe a toad or snake stuck in the pipe.
- Let's hope we don't end up like Ugolin.
Impossible!
It hasn't stopped in 50 years.
I'll go check the catchment basin.
Nothing!
- OK, I'm off.
- Don't worry.
Monsieur Jean, I know you.
You're a good man, up in heaven.
You can see my feet are so swollen, I can't wear shoes, and my mule's on the brink of death.
If this keeps up, in a week my carnations are screwed.
Allez!
C'mon, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, give us back your daughter's spring.
So be it.
Come on!
AMEN, Goddammit!
Hello?
That's me.
Yes, I'm the mayor.
When will he get here...
Tomorrow?
!
We'll be dead, tomorrow, he must come right away!
We have no bread!
The harvest is screwed!
It's a disaster!
I'll expect him tomorrow, noon, at town hall.
Thank you!
We're saved, the specialist is coming tomorrow.
- What specialist?
- The one I've been calling all day!
The agricultural engineer.
The meeting is open.
Voila!
I called this meeting over the question of water.
It's not a "question".
It's a catastrophe!
Well said: "catastrophe"!
But thanks to my personal efforts and thanks to my telephone,
I called to our aid, the Agricultural Engineer.
The Agricultural Engineer.
Voila!
Messieurs,
I've studied your problem.
And here's the report I'll file to the attention of the Chief Engineer.
Perdrix Spring, that fed your village fountain, was the most important, most reliable one in the whole region.
It came from a fissure between two limestone layers of the late cretaceous period.
Not a case of diaclasis, but a resurgence of the Vauclusian type.
Let's not confuse the two.
Clearly, then, the layer between the two impervious ones surfaced by this path.
The water, capped by the upper strata, became pressurized and formed a trapped layer that fed your catchment basin, by resurgence.
The basin, then, fed the fountain in the village by pipe, by gravity.
Oh yeah, that's serious!
So, at the request of your mayor, as mandated by the Ministry, we researched the causes of this deplorable accident.
First of all, what was the origin of the water?
Fortunately we have a very valuable document.
Now, it's getting interesting!
It's a study, by the Chief Engineer, that outlines, in a clear and useful manner some field surveys made five years ago in this region.
Unfortunately... your spring doesn't figure on the Chief Engineer's survey map.
It's impossible to integrate it into the *orography of the Huveaune River, or any of its affluents.
So, where does that get us?
If the water isn't local, we must conclude it comes from farther away.
- I want the floor.
- This is not the time!
What I have to say is short!
Instead of yakking so long he should bring back the water.
Afterwards, he can explain!
I'm not in the waterworks department.
The first hypothesis is drought.
Possibly a slight drop in the water table may be the cause of all your problems.
If the resurgence is drawn down by a series of parallel dolomites into the Jurassic layer, it should overcome this by way of a syphon system.
You know what a syphon is?
A rubber tube to draw wine!
Exactly.
After the next rain, the syphons will be primed, as the underground lake which feeds your springs rises to its habitual level.
Underground lake?
!
Certainly!
Those who oppose progress aren't always right.
If progress returns my water, I embrace it!
If my spring flows again, here's 100 francs for progress!
Wait for the rest... the rest of this load of bollocks.
Now, the second hypothesis.
The underground stream cut through its bed and fell into a cave system.
Once these cavities are filled the water regains its old level and the spring flows again.
In how many days?
How many days, is impossible to say, precisely.
Maybe two days...
Maybe two years.
Maybe 100 years.
That can't be excuded!
All right, third hypothsesis...
To hell with hypotheses!
There's no bread, what can you do for us?
For your domestic needs, the Ministry will provide a daily tank truck with 5,000 liters of water.
It should suffice to cover your most urgent needs.
How much water for my carnations?
If the water's not back in a month, what can you do for us?
We'd suggest you farm elsewhere.
What do you want me to say?
There's plenty of villages with abundant water!
No, monsieur!
The Municipal Council can't accept that!
Your Council's influence over subterranean phenomena is less than ZERO.
- Third hypothesis...
- Fuck your 'apothecaries'!
This is our Ministry?
!
What a hell of a way to administer!
Monsieur, the Ministry suggests you take a flying fuck!
You'll have to manage with the water truck.
The truck'll be here Sunday.
Mesdames and messieurs, good-bye!
Take it easy, or they'll send the police!
Where is he?
Where is he?
Where's the President of the Water Syndicate?
Who's the President of the Water Syndicate?
It's not me, it's YOU!
I'm only President because I'm the mayor and I have a phone!
- And what's this?
- Your receipt for the water bill.
- Exactly!
Fifty-two francs, plus the stamp.
You took my money.
Where's the water, I paid for?
If you'd come earlier, the engineer would've explained the *orography.
You must take into account the *orography.
I'm not taking anything into account!
Especially, not that!
I paid for water, I want my water!
Listen, a water truck will come every day from the Prefecture.
Bring your mule and barrels and you'll get 150 litres a day like everybody else.
First:
I have no mule, I have a donkey.
Second: 150 litres will do for a bistro, not for a pasture.
Third:
I paid for spring water, not truck water!
I think the truck water comes from a spring.
But not mine!
I paid for water!
I want my water!
Stop yelling!
You're exhausting yourself and us.
It's pointless!
Oh, Mother of God!
What about my aubergines?
And 600 tomato* plants, big as my fist?
(love apples)
It's a widespread affliction.
A case of force majeure!
I'm major force, too!
I paid for water, I want my water!
The spring isn't running.
Where do you expect us to get it?
Wherever you want!
But make it come out of MY pipe!
And you, don't stick your nose in this business!
You may a Councilman, but I didn't vote for you!
Like, I give a fuck about your vote!
You pain in the ass, where do you think you are?
I'm among water thieves!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
- Good morning, Messieurs.
- 'Morning
Today is my birthday.
After Mass you're invited for an aperitif, at the schoolyard.
You can't choose the day you're born.
My brothers, I am truly glad.
Glad to see you all gathered in our little church.
The whole parish is here.
I even see a small group of 'intellects' --perhaps, too intellectual-- who habitually observe Holy Mass on the terrace of a cafe.
I won't name the cafe.
We only have one.
I won't name those persons, since you're all staring at them.
Which ought to fill them with shame, but, their stony hearts cause them to smirk!
You come, clasping your hands, visibly shaken, distraught by faith and repentance.
But, God knows you're here because your spring has stopped.
The prayers you pretend to address to Him, are pleas for your beans, orations for your tomatoes, hallelujahs for Jerusalem artichokes, hosannas for your pumpkins!
As for the spring, I must speak seriously.
I'm incessantly asking myself the same question.
This water --so pure, so abundant, so constant, until now-- why did it dry up?
And in the hour of our need?
I, once, read in a profane (secular) work;
a Greek tragedy about... the unfortunate city of Thebes struck by an all consuming plague because its king had committed crimes.
I considered the question:
"is there a criminal among us?"
It's not at all impossible.
The greatest crimes aren't in the newspapers.
Many escape man's justice.
But God knows them all.
I'd like to address this unknown criminal, if he exists.
I'd like to say to him:
my brother... there's no error that can't be forgiven, no crime that can't be redressed.
Sincere repentance erases all.
Our Lord, Jesus Christ, uttered this surprising phrase:
There is more room in heaven for one repentant sinner, than for one hundred just persons. (Luke 15:7)
Whatever your sin, however great your offense, try to redress it.
Repent!
You shall be saved.
And your spring will flow, lovelier than ever!
- Papet.
- Hm?
He harped on the subject.
He looked at me three times.
What could this cleric know?
He's been here less than a year.
Yeah, but, maybe somebody told him in confession.
Ah, Anglade!
That's NOT impossible.
He's such a bigot... that he's liable to confess other people's sins.
- What worries me is the girl.
- Me too.
She gave you a dirty look.
She looked at me twice as if to say, "The criminal, is you."
- No, she doesn't know anything, either.
- Then, why does she worry you?
It seems, she's not interested in you.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday and good health to our school instructor!
- Happy birthday
- Merci.
- Here's to you!
***[Provencal]
***[Provencal]
How about that sermon!
What did you think?
What do you expect me to think?
It's just words.
I don't think the spring dried up by divine intervention.
The priest seemed to allude to a crime that he knows.
He couldn't speak clearly, no doubt, because he heard it in confession.
What crime?
If anyone committed a crime, in the village, we'd all know.
No, it seemed to me, the speech was addressed to someone.
- Who?
- Who?
He seemed to look, often, at Ugolin.
Especially as he spoke of the king who brought the plague down on everybody.
- So, I've got the plague, now?
!
- Don't say such things, even as a joke!
- O-hoh, you got a whiff of our Pastis!
- I didn't come about Pastis but about water!
I want to speak to you.
I have something important to tell you.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
If you want, you can bring back our water.
Me?
How?
By coming to the procession.
Will you?
Then, our fountain will never flow again.
Do you take her for a saint?
!
An orphan's prayer soars to heaven like a lark.
Our Lord Jesus Christ will gladly hear its song.
She's innocent and if she prays for us we're saved.
Yes, Manon, you must come.
You must save our carnations.
I won't pray for the criminals who stole my father's spring!
I don't understand.
They understand.
They know why God is punishing them.
Explain.
Do you know the criminal?
There are two.
That's them.
If we're to be treated like criminals, I'd rather go home.
Come, Galinette.
M. Soubeyran, your precipitous retreat is not in your favour.
I don't give a fuck, what anyone may think!
I keep my own conscience!
Let's go!
- You coming?
- No.
First, I want her to tell me what she's accusing me of, because I know the means of fixing everything.
I'd like to know how they managed to steal your father's water.
It's purely in her imagintion!
It's true, her father lacked water and maybe that ruined him.
He searched a long time and surely would've found it, if he didn't die by accident.
When my nephew and I, saw those two women on their own, we bought their little farmstead.
In part because we liked it, to tell the truth.
In part, also, to do them a favour!
Later, we searched for the spring, and had the luck of finding it.
Voila!
That's what she calls "stealing his water"!
"You give'em your bread, and they shit on your head!"
- Come on, Galinette.
- It's not true, he's lying!
The truth is, the spring always existed.
The truth is, you blocked the spring.
That's the truth.
Why would they do that?
To buy it for chicken feed.
Without water, the farm was worthless.
My father's dead, because of these assassins.
It's not true!
It's calumny!
I found it by dangling my pocket-watch.
You and your mother saw me using my pocket-watch.
You were holding a squash under your arm.
Tell the truth!
In less than an hour?
!
I suppose, the spring told you what God Himself told Pascal:
"You wouldn't look for me, unless you'd already found me." (Pensées 553)
Fuck Pascal!
I met him only once.
He was rude, so I smacked him around a bit!
You may laugh, but it's true.
Here's what we've come to.
What she ACTUALLY saw, she won't believe;
but what she NEVER saw, she believes.
Who saw us block up the spring?
Ah!
Who saw us block up that spring?
ME!
I saw you.
I saw both of you.
Liar!
What do you think you saw, you pitiful idiot?
You could never even tell left from right.
In the army, they put an "X" on his left hand and two on his right.
He still didn't get it, so they sent him home.
Hah!
I sure fooled them!
Wasn't easy, but it worked.
The major had his doubts, once he said...
We're not interested in in your life story, just what you saw.
What he saw?
Nothing!
He dreamt it.
I never dream!
- It was 9 or 10 years ago.
- See?
Doesn't even know the date!
Just after Pique-Bouffigue died.
I was at Romarins, hunting partridge.
There was a puddle, where partridges came to drink, since the farmhouse was empty.
I picked the lock, went to the granary loft...
- How lovely!
Ransacking a dead man's house.
Just, lovely!
Pique-Bouffigue had two small windows under the gutters to shoot at thrushes.
I sat there and I slept.
Ah, you see, he slept!
He dreamt it, I tell you!
I slept, but I didn't dream!
Suddenly I heard the sounds of a pick-axe and woke up.
And, through the attic window,
I saw this one digging, and the other keeping a lookout.
I didn't dare move.
I saw water gush out of the hole.
Then, they got cement and I saw them plug the spring!
Why didn't you tell her father?
It was none of my business.
God punished them by cutting their water but He cut ours, too.
So, now it IS my business!
Listen, all of you.
Suppose what you're saying is true, which it isn't, eh?
I'm just, supposing.
You don't know that, I'd give it all to her;
the spring, the carnations, the farm, the fortune, the Soubeyran inheritance, my life.
You know it.
I told you on the hill.
I love you more than it's possible to say.
Listen.
Listen to me, Manon.
All the time, you haunt me.
All the time, I mutter to you.
My food has lost its taste, it's killing my sleep...
If you won't have me, I'll either die or go crazy.
Shut up, imbecile.
Let's go.
Think about it, just a little.
Don't you see what a terrible muddle I'm in?
Remorse for the harm I've caused you, and delight at all the good I'd gladly do for you.
Don't you see how hard I'll work for you?
- Don't you see, my love?
My lo..
- Get him away from me!
My love.
C'mon, don't be silly, stand up.
Think, Manon.
Think about it.
I'll die for your love, and nobody will care!
Come, Galinette, come home.
NOOO!
This is all your fault!
I lost everything because of you!
If I'd known...
Galinette!
Galinette, my boy!
I'm staying!
Since everybody's against him, I'll stay to defend him.
Seems a difficut task.
You know very well, there's never been a spring at Romarins.
Perhaps a little puddle.
But, I found the real spring!
Come on, all of you, from Bastides, like me... tell them there never was a spring!
Pay close attention to this.
If you knew there was one, and didn't tell the hunchback... then you're responsible for his death.
That old sonofabitch!
- You knew?
- Sure, we knew.
Everybody knew.
Nobody dared oppose the Soubeyrans to defend an outsider from Crespin.
Mostly he hated my grandmother, and took it out on her son.
- What grandmother?
- Florette.
They never forgave her for leaving Bastides to marry a man from Crespin.
Florette was your grandmother?
The hunchback was Florette's son?
Monsieur!
Monsieur, Le Papet said he wants to see you and the mayor too.
Le Papet wants to see you.
You too, M. "L'oiseau".
- Me?
Yeah, he said to come quick and that you'd be pleased.
- Where is he?
- At Romarins, waiting.
What's up with Cesar?
Put him on the table.
Put him there.
Go to the village... tell the mute woman to get some candles from the church.
At least six, of the largest ones.
And the linen sheet his grandmother wove.
You, Pamphile, prepare the casket.
You'll find some oak boards in the attic.
Old oaks, I'd intended for myself.
I know, you ordered them from me.
Use them for him.
And, especially, you should all... say he fell from a tree.
Keep it secret... for three days.
Until after the ceremony.
Or the priest won't perform the proper rites.
Now, go.
I'll stay with you.
There's no need.
I'm not saying she could've loved him.
But, she could've married him, and gotten her best revenge, by driving him out of his mind.
Papet, I'm leaving because I can't take it anymore.
It's not about the carnations.
Who cares if they die.
It's because of my love.
I realized she'd never have me.
I suspected it because my love ribbon caused a burning abcess.
When I told her in front of everyone that I wanted to marry and give it all to her, she spat on me with words.
What's more, she fled towards the schoolteacher.
When he talks to her, she stares at the ground.
When he stops, she yearns for him to continue.
He's not astonished by this.
He finds it perfectly natural.
He doesn't know how lucky he is, but I know my own misery.
I can't stand him.
I'd like to kill him.
But it would hurt her.
So be it, I won't deny her.
I leave her my farm and all that's hidden in it you know under the stone, left of the fireplace.
Don't give her a hard time.
It's not her fault or yours.
It's fate.
Have some Masses said for me, because, up there, I'll have some explaining to do about the spring.
Adessias*, Papet. (Adieu)
It pains me to quit you, but, I cannot stay.
You know?
Yes, I know.
What will you do?
I don't know.
I don't think I'll go back there.
Too many bad memories.
I'd always see him hanging in place of my swing.
And he must have left his odor around the house.
Will you join the procession?
If the water won't come back... if you're persuaded it never will, I suggest you go.
If your father was still alive and had the power to give them back their spring, what would he do?
My father would have liked to be their friend.
In memory of him, do what he would have done.
♪ ***
One, two... ♪ ***
You think this procession will help?
You never know.
I dunno how I'd feel if, at the first oremus*, the fountain began to flow.
I'd be terrified, I'd have to go to confession immediately.
Voila.
That's the problem.
If the water returned today,
I know several fools who'd reason like you.
With a village full of fanatics I'd surely lose the mayorship.
Ah, for sure!
Miracles are very unforgiving, for sure.
Something's happening!
Stop!
Stop!
It's breathing...
It's breathing.
The pipe is venting.
A miracle!
On your knees!
On your knees!
On your knees, everybody kneel!
There's no miracle in this!
Just a coincidence, is all!

I recognize your footsteps.
Your ear is as sharp as an eye.
That's hardly a replacement, Cesar.
No replacement at at all.
Belly dancing is all very well... but you did a foolish thing while you were over there.
Me?
I say "foolish," but it's practically a crime.
I don't know what foolishness you mean.
I got wounded, they were going to make me corporal.
That's something else.
I'm thinking of a letter you received.
What letter?
One that deserved an answer.
An you never answered.
A letter from whom?
I see, you don't want to talk about it because you think I don't know.
- Delphine, I swear...
- Don't swear, scoundrel!
Excuse me for bringing up something unpleasant for you.
Unpleasant for me?
Look Delphine, we're in front of the church,
I can see the cross up on the steeple.
Before this cross, I swear, I never received any letter except from my father, Anglade and Castagne.
Well, then, that makes this a disaster.
Why?
Swear again that you're not spouting hypocrisy.
I swear.
Who wrote to me?
Florette.
Florette Camoins?
You know very well there were not two Florettes.
Are you sure?
I gave the letter to the mailman, myself.
I'd never forget a letter from her.
I still keep two half-faded penciled notes of hers and a comb with her hair.
Oh, yeah.
When I came back, she'd left the village.
She was married to that blacksmith in Crespin.
And she already had a child.
How is it possible for that letter to get lost?
You know, over there, we changed our location a lot.
Sometimes we didn't get our food or even cartridges.
It was quite possible for letters to get lost.
But, if I'd received it
I'd remember it by heart.
If that's true, it's just terrible.
You think she loved me?
Imbecile!
She never told me.
Even after what happened one night, coming home from Anglade's barn dance.
That was her character.
In her letter she told you she was pregnant.
What?
Yes.
You'd been gone about three weeks.
She said, if you wrote to her father, promising to marry her, she'd wait for you.
She could have shown her letter to the whole village and no one would dream of mocking her.
Are you sure?
Poor girl, couldn't sleep.
She tried to lose the baby with devilish concoctions.
In the hills, she'd jump from rockfaces.
But it clung tight to her.
Then, she detested you.
She went to dance at Aubagne, where she met the blacksmith from Crespin.
She left the village and no one ever knew when the child was born.
Was it born alive?
Yes, alive... but a hunchback.
Oh, I hear Clairette coming.
Come here, my girl.
It's starting to get nippy.
I think I'd be better off near a fire.
Adessias, Cesar.
(Adieu)
Rest assured, I've never told anyone.
I'll pray for you.
What is it, Papet?
Are you ill?
Don't stand here.
Let's find some shelter.
Are you sick?
Want me to call a doctor?
- I'll call Ombrées, if you want.
- No, thanks.
I know what's wrong.
Lean on me.
I'll take you back.
My friend, I don't see you anywhere near death's door.
Well, that's where I see myself.
I know I'll be gone tonight.
What makes you think that?
I'll die because I have no wish to go on.
Come, confess me.
You'll see, I really need it.
You know that suicide is a mortal sin?
I won't need to kill myself.
All I need, is to let myself go.
♪ [Lei pastoureu]
Dear God, I beg you, don't let her baby be a hunchback.
Dear little Manon, the notary at Ombrées will tell you that I'm leaving you my whole estate.
This may astonish you, but it's the God's honest truth.
The notary will give you all the deeds and papers.
Because your father was my son.
My Soubeyran heir, which I've longed for, all my life and who I watched die, bit by bit, because I didn't know it was him.
If I'd only to told him about the spring, now, he'd still be playing his harmonica and you'd all be living in our family home.
No one knows of this, yet I'm ashamed to face the world, even the trees.
Someone in the village, knows all about it.
If you mention my letter, she'll explain.
It's Delphine, the old blind woman.
She'll tell you it's all Africa's fault.
I haven't earned the right to say I embrace you... and I never dared speak to you.
But, maybe now, you can forgive me and sometimes say a little prayer for poor Ugolin and me.
I feel like a pitiful wretch.
Imagine, out of malice, I never went near him.
I never knew his voice or his face.
I never looked, close, into his eyes, which might have been his mother's.♥
I only saw his hump and his pain:
all harm that I caused him.
So, you can understand why I pine for death.
Compared to the torment of my thoughts, even hell would be a delight.
Anyway, I'll see him up there.
I'm not afraid of him, on the contrary.
Now he knows he's a Soubeyran and no longer a hunchback by my fault.
He understands that it all came about through folly.
I'm sure that instead of blaming me he'll defend me.
Adessias, ma pitchounette.
(Adieu, my sweet girl)
Your grandfather, Cesar Soubeyran.

IF I COULD GET ANGRY, THIS WOULDN'T HAPPEN.
I'M REALLY SORRY TO GET YOU INVOLVED IN THIS.
NO, NO.
IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE PROBABLY PEAKING ON ANGER IN YOUR BIORHYTHMS.
WHAT?
WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK OUT
EVENTUALLY YOU WILL.
THANKS, DR. HUXTABLE.
SONDRA, DO YOU CARE ENOUGH ABOUT ME
TO TRY TO WORK IT OUT?
NO, ELVIN, I DON'T.
OKAY, I UNDERSTAND.
ELVIN, I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.
I CARE ABOUT YOU A GREAT DEAL.
I SAID THAT TO MAKE YOU MAD.
OH.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK ON THIS.
YOU'RE GOING TO WORK ON IT NOW?
IT'S IMPORTANT TO EXAMINE THESE EMOTIONS
WHILE WE'RE IN THE MOMENT.
OKAY, HONEY.
ALL RIGHT, DEAR.
ELVIN, YOU CAN STRAIGHTEN ALL THIS UP FOR TWO DOLLARS.
HI.
HI!
HI, DADDY.
HI, DR. HUXTABLE.
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO HAVE PERMISSION
TO SIT UP HERE AND WATCH TV?
MOMMY SAID WE COULD.
SHE DID?
YES.
SHE SAID IF WE WERE QUIET WHILE YOU WERE ASLEEP
WHEN YOU GOT UP, WE COULD WATCH TV HERE.
YOU SLEPT A LONG TIME.
WANT TO WATCH CARTOONS WITH US?
NO, THANK YOU.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHO IS IT?
IT'S ME.
HOW DO I KNOW IT ISN'T ONE OF MY CHILDREN
IMITATING MY WIFE'S VOICE?
IT'S ME.
IF IT IS YOU, THEN WHERE DID WE EAT
THE NIGHT YOU GRADUATED FROM LAW SCHOOL?
MICHAEL AND ENNIO'S.
WRONG!
IT WAS MARIANI'S.
IT WAS NOT!
OKAY, OKAY.
HOW COULD YOU FORGET THAT?
DON'T PUT ME IN A HEADLOCK.
OH, COME IN.
HURRY UP BEFORE THE CHILDREN...
COME ON.
WHEN I CALLED FROM THE OFFICE
AND FOUND OUT HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE HERE
I DECIDED TO STOP FOR PIZZA.
I KNEW YOU'D BE HIDING.
DID THE CHILDREN SEE YOU COME DOWN HERE?
OH, NO.
GOOD.
I WAITED UNTIL THEY WERE FEEDING
THEN I GRABBED THE ONLY PIZZA
WITH BLACK OLIVES, ANCHOVIES AND SAUSAGE
SNEAKED OUT THE BACK DOOR
AND CAME IN THROUGH THE ENTRANCE
TO YOUR OFFICE.
YOU ARE A GENIUS.
AND I AM A GENIUS BECAUSE I MARRIED YOU.
CLIFF, YOU THINK WE SHOULD TELL THE KIDS WE'RE DOWN HERE?
ARE YOU DRUNK?
DR. HUXTABLE, ARE YOU IN THERE?
ELVIN.
DR. HUXTABLE?
I'M IN HERE WITH A PATIENT RIGHT NOW.
I'M GETTING READY TO DELIVER A BABY.
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.
NO, IT CAN'T BE THAT IMPORTANT
BECAUSE THE WOMAN IS GOING TO DELIVER ANY SECOND NOW.
SO YOU HAVE TO GO BACK UPSTAIRS.
HI, DR. HUXTABLE.
HI, MRS. HUXTABLE.
EDDIE WAS GOING TO GIVE ME A RIDE HOME
BUT HE CAN'T BECAUSE YOUR CAR IS BLOCKING HIS CAR
IN THE DRIVEWAY.
I'LL GET THE KEYS.
YOU CAN MOVE IT.
SONDRA GOT YOUR EXTRA KEYS.
WE TRIED TO START IT, BUT NOTHING HAPPENED.
JUST PUSH IT ASIDE
AND I'LL HAVE MY MECHANIC LOOK AT IT TOMORROW.
YOUR MECHANIC WORKS ON SUNDAY?
WE'D BETTER MOVE IT NOW.
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THIS, DR. HUXTABLE.
OH!
SO THIS IS WHERE
THE ANCHOVY, BLACK OLIVE AND SAUSAGE PIZZA WENT.
DO YOU MIND IF I JUST...
ELVIN.
I'VE STAYED TOO LONG.
GENTLEMEN.
HI, MRS. HUXTABLE.
HI, MRS. HUXTABLE.
HI, DR. HUXTABLE.
ARE YOU ALL WEARING MY CLOTHES?
THAT'S A GOOD ONE, DR. HUXTABLE.
THANK YOU.
WE ALL WENT HOME AND CHANGED.
HOW'S THE CAR?
IT'S FINE.
EVERYTHING'S FIXED.
WELL, SINCE YOU ALL ARE DRESSED UP AND LOOKING SMOOTH
I GUESS YOU'RE GOING SOMEPLACE, ARE YOU?
VANESSA AND I ARE GOING TO A SCHOOL DANCE.
IT'S NOT A FORMAL
BUT WE LIKE TO LOOK GOOD.
SONDRA AND I ARE TAKING RUDY TO SEE THE ALVIN AILEY DANCE COMPANY.
EDDIE, ARE YOU TAKING DENISE OUT?
YES, MA'AM.
WELL, GOOD.
I GUESS I'D BETTER GO CHECK ON EVERYONE.
YOU KNOW, WHEN MY GIRLS WERE LITTLE
AND I'D HOLD THEM IN MY ARMS
I ALWAYS KNEW THEY WOULD DATE BOYS
BUT I NEVER FIGURED THEY WOULD BE THIS HANDSOME.
THANK YOU, SIR.
THAT'S THE WAY LIFE GOES.
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN.
WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN
YOU LOOK BACK ON WHAT YOU THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN
AND SAY, "THAT'S NOT HOW I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAPPEN."
THERE YOU GO.
WHOA!
BYE, DAD.
NO, NO, NO.
COME HERE.
NOW YOU KNOW THIS IS A SPECIAL OCCASION.
YEAH.
YOU KNOW I WANT TO SEE THIS.
SO TURN AROUND.
YES...
I THINK A HANDSHAKE IS IN ORDER FOR THIS
AND I HOPE YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME.
THANKS, DAD.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I ALSO THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE-
INSTEAD OF FIVE
SINCE THIS IS SO SPECIAL-
WE SHOULD HAVE TEN.
ALL RIGHT.
NO, NO, TEN.
NO, NO, NO.
COME ON, DROP IT.
DAD, COME ON.
COME ON, LOWER IT.
OHHH!
LET ME SEE YOURS.
LET ME SEE.
WOOO.
WOOO.
USED TO DO THAT MYSELF WHEN I WENT TO THE DANCES
AND I WANTED TO LOOK OLDER.
I'D TAKE THE MASCARA PENCIL
AND MAKE THE MUSTACHE.
IT'S THEM!
DAD, PLEASE DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
DON'T SAY ANYTHING?
I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.
ANYTHING.
I NEVER SAID...
I'LL DO ANYTHING.
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, DAD.
YOU KNOW ME.
I KNOW YOU!
PLEASE, DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
OKAY, OKAY, YOU PROMISE.
NO, I DIDN'T PROMISE.
I DON'T HAVE TO PROMISE, I'M THE FATHER.
BYE, DAD!
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!
I HAVE TO MEET THE YOUNG LADIES.
SO BRING THE YOUNG LADIES IN.
PLEASE BRING THEM IN.
HAPPY TO MEET YOU.
THIS IS MY DAD, DR. HUXTABLE.
THIS IS TRACEY AND LINDA.
TRACEY, HOW ARE YOU?
FINE.
AND LINDA.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
I MUST TELL YOU
THAT YOU ARE GOING OUT WITH SOME VERY MANLY MEN.
YEAH.
OH, YES...
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE.
NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT.
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU
WHEN I WENT OUT TO DANCES AT THIS AGE
I USED TO TAKE...
WE HAVE TO GO.
WAIT, WAIT, THE ONE THING I WANTED TO SAY...
WELL, GO AHEAD.
JUST HAVE A GOOD TIME.
I HOPE IT DOESN'T RAIN ON YOUR FACE.
I'M READY.
LOOK AT ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE.
I WANT TO TAKE A PICTURE.
DAD, WE DON'T WANT TO BE LATE.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
HOW DO I LOOK?
GOOD.
HOW DO I LOOK?
GOOD.
WHAT ABOUT US?
GOOD.
HOW ABOUT ME?
GOOD.
HOW DO I LOOK?
GOOD.
DENISE, COME ON!
I WANT TO TAKE A PICTURE.
HOW DO I LOOK?
GOOD!
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.
SAY
'NEWMONNOIDS'.
NEWMONNOIDS!
AH!
ALL RIGHT.
THIS IS SOMETHING
I WILL CHERISH THE REST OF MY LIFE.
NOW ALL OF YOU, GET OUT!
BYE, DAD.
GOOD NIGHT, DR. HUXTABLE.
GOODBYE.
GOOD NIGHT.
YEA!
NOW!
OH, TO SIT HERE
IN MY HOUSE-
OH, IT'S SO WONDERFUL, DEAR-
AND READ MY PAPER.
OF COURSE, BY THIS TIME NOW
THIS IS NOT NEWS.
MAY I TURN ON THE TV?
YOU MAY TURN ON OUR TV.
THANK YOU.
A WEEK BEFORE MATING, THE MALE PERUVIAN SAND CRICKET
GATHERS SMALL STICKS AND BLADES OF GRASS
WHICH HE USES TO BUILD A HUT-LIKE NEST.
IN THIS HUT, THE MATING WILL TAKE PLACE.
TO LURE THE FEMALE INTO THE HUT
THE CRICKET RUBS HIS HIND LEGS TOGETHER
PRODUCING A LOUD, CRACKLING SOUND.
ALTHOUGH IRRITATING TO NEARBY VILLAGES
TO THE FEMALE SAND CRICKET
IT IS AN ALLURING, SEDUCTIVE LOVE SONG.
DRAWN TO THE HUT, THE FEMALE ENTERS SHYLY AT FIRST
BUT ONCE INSIDE
THE MALE COURTS HER WITH A RITUALISTIC MATING DANCE.
THEN MATING BEGINS.
AS THE MATING PROCESS NEARS COMPLETION
A CURIOUS THING HAPPENS.
THE FEMALE FLIPS THE MALE OVER
PINS HIM DOWN
AND EATS HIM ALIVE.
NOW WAIT A MINUTE.
I'VE GOT TO SEE THIS.
LEAVING ONLY THE MALES LEGS BEHIND
THE FEMALE BACKS OUT OF THE HUT
KNOCKS IT DOWN
AND DANCES ON TOP OF IT.
VANESSA?
GO ON AND GET IN YOUR OWN BED NOW.
I LEFT $5 UNDER YOUR PILLOW.
HI.
HEY, HOW ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT TIME IS IT?
5:15 A.M.
OH, GOODNESS.
YOU MUST BE TIRED.
NOT TIRED ENOUGH TO SLEEP ON TOP OF MY CHILD.
I SAID IT WAS OKAY
TILL YOU CAME HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL.
VANESSA, HONEY.
DADDY'S HOME.
HI, DAD.
HI.
COME ON.
HI, DADDY.
HI, DEAR.
GO BACK TO YOUR OWN BED.
DO WE HAVE TO?
YES, DEAR.
BYE-BYE.
JUST KEEP ON GOING.
DAD?
IS THERE REALLY $5 UNDER MY PILLOW?
NO.
I KNEW IT.
I'M SORRY.
THERE YOU GO, DEAR.
VANESSA...
PICK HER UP.
OHH.
I AM GOING TO DO SOME SERIOUS SLEEPING TONIGHT!
YOU'VE HAD DELIVERIES FOUR NIGHTS IN A ROW.
TONIGHT WAS THE WORST, DEAR.
I WOULD FINISH ONE...
GET ALL WASHED UP
GET READY TO COME HOME
AND A CAR WOULD PULL UP-- VAROOM!
ONE POOR MAN PULLED UP WITHOUT HIS WIFE.
HE HAD TO DRIVE ALL THE WAY BACK.
THEN A WOMAN CAME WALKING IN ON HER OWN.
SAID SHE COULDN'T WAIT FOR HER HUSBAND
WHO HAD PASSED OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FREEWAY.
SO BOTH OF THEM STARTED TO GET READY AT THE SAME TIME.
OH, IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD SLEEP.
TODAY IS SATURDAY.
SLEEP AS LATE AS YOU WANT.
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.
I'M GOING TO GET INTO THAT BED
AND I'M GOING TO SLEEP UNTIL MY EYES JUST POP OPEN.
AND THEN I'M GOING TO WAIT FIVE MINUTES
THEN I'M GOING TO THE SLEEP BANK
AND I'M GOING TO MAKE ANOTHER WITHDRAWAL
AND SLEEP SOME MORE.
THEN I'LL GET UP
TAKE MY NEWSPAPER, FIND A QUIET ROOM
AND JUST SIT THERE AND READ MY PAPER IN PEACE.
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA.
CLIFF?
YEAH.
DID YOU LOCK THE DOOR?
YEAH, I LOCKED THE DOOR.
YOU SURE?
YES, I'M SURE.
WHAT ABOUT THE LIGHTS?
YEAH, I LOCKED THE LIGHTS, TOO, DEAR.
CLIFF, ARE YOU SURE YOU LOCKED THE DOOR?
I NOT ONLY LOCKED IT
I SHOVED THE FURNITURE UP AGAINST IT, TOO.
I'M ONLY ASKING BECAUSE OF THAT TIME
YOU WERE SO SURE YOU HAD LOCKED THE DOOR
AND YOU DIDN'T.
THAT WAS 15 YEARS AGO.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
TO GET SOMETHING TO DRINK.
I'LL GET YOU SOMETHING TO DRINK.
YOU WANT TO SEE IF I LOCKED UP EVERYTHING.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
DO YOU WANT MILK?
YES.
OKAY, I'LL GET SOME MILK FOR YOU.
THANK YOU.
AND CLIFF, WHILE YOU'RE DOWN THERE
DOUBLE-CHECK THE LOCK ON THE DOOR.
YOU COULD BE BOSSY IF YOU WANTED TO.
( YAWNING )
PHEW!
I'M GIVING YOU ONE LAST CHANCE TO FORGET ABOUT THIS.
COCKROACH, IN A GOOD LIGHT
YOU'LL BE HUMILIATED.
YOU WISH!
IF YOU SAY SO.
THEO:
CHECK OUT THIS MUSTACHE.
COCKROACH:
I CAN'T EVEN SEE IT.
I CAN'T SEE YOURS.
THEN HOW COME TRACEY DARNELL
IS GOING OUT WITH ME TONIGHT?
BECAUSE WE'RE DOUBLE-DATING.
SHE'S USING YOU TO LOOK AT MY MUSTACHE.
SHE'D BETTER BRING A MAGNIFYING GLASS.
HEY, DAD.
HEY, FELLAS.
HOW ARE YOU?
LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN.
THEO, WALTER--
LOOKING AT THE TWO OF YOU
I'VE NOTICED SOMETHING ABOUT YOU THAT'S MORE MANLY.
THANKS.
ONE OF US MORE THAN THE OTHER?
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S EQUAL MASCULINITY.
THANKS, DAD.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
HE ONLY SAID THAT 'CAUSE YOU'RE HIS SON.
HE MEANT MY MUSTACHE AND YOUR FEET.
(* SOUL MUSIC *)
HEY, DAD.
HI, DR. HUXTABLE.
WHY DO YOU HAVE ON TWO RADIOS?
IT GIVES A RICHER SOUND, DR. HUXTABLE.
IF YOU POSITION THEM RIGHT, YOU GET TRUER TONALITY.
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE THERE.
DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE ME WITH YOU?
SORRY.
WHERE'S MOM?
SHE HAD TO LEAVE FOR THE OFFICE.
DOES YOUR FATHER ALWAYS SLEEP THIS LATE?
HE'S BEEN WORKING NIGHTS THIS WEEK.
HE MIGHT BE IN A LOW ENERGY CYCLE.
A LOW ENERGY CYCLE?
YEAH.
YOU SHOULD GET YOUR BIORHYTHMS CHECKED.
ROBERT AND I DID.
THERE WAS A MAN OUTSIDE LAYTHAM'S DEPARTMENT STORE
IN A BOOTH.
BOOTH?
WE GAVE HIM OUR ASTROLOGICAL SIGNS
TIME OF BIRTH AND FAVORITE COLORS.
AND WHAT ELSE?
TWO DOLLARS APIECE.
I PROMISED VANESSA I'D PAY HER BACK.
ARE YOU ON A LOW CASH CYCLE?
THAT'S A GOOD ONE, DR. HUXTABLE.
YEAH, THANK YOU.
HE FED THE INFORMATION INTO A COMPUTER
AND A FEW SECONDS LATER, WE GOT THESE CHARTS.
THEY PROVE WHAT WE'VE THOUGHT ALL ALONG--
WE'RE RIGHT FOR EACH OTHER.
LOOK AT THESE, DAD.
THEY SHOW THE DIFFERENT PEAKS AND VALLEYS
IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF YOUR LIFE.
RIGHT NOW, ROBERT AND I ARE PEAKING ON AMBITION
AND PEAKING ON ROMANCE.
AND WE BOTH VALLEY ON JEALOUSY AND POWER.
IT'S AMAZING.
WE'RE ORGANICALLY AND COSMICALLY IN TOTAL SYNCH.
YEAH.
WELL, I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.
YOU AND MRS. HUXTABLE SHOULD GO TO THE BIORHYTHM BOOTH
AND GET YOUR CHARTS MADE.
I'D BE GLAD TO HELP YOU READ THEM.
ROBERT, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE PEAKING ON GENEROSITY.
YEAH.
YES.
AND I'M ORGANICALLY AND COSMICALLY IN SYNCH
WITH WHAT IS COMING OUT OF YOUR FACE.
(* REGGAE MUSIC *)
HI, DADDY.
HI, HON.
HOW ARE YOU?
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET EDDIE LAKEHEART.
EDDIE, HOW ARE YOU?
HI, DR. HUXTABLE.
HAVE A SIT DOWN.
(* REGGAE MUSIC *)
I SEE YOU'RE WATCHING THE ALL-MUSIC STATION.
YOU'RE INTO REGGAE, HUH?
YEAH.
* I SAY HEY, MAN *
* I SAY YOU GO DOWN *
* AND I SAY HEY, MAN *
* B-R-R-R *
* HEY, MAN *

* I SAID HEY, MAN *
* B-R-R-R *
* HEY, MAN *
OH, I'M SORRY.
ELVIN, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HERE.
I CAME OVER TO STUDY.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
HI, HONEY.
HI, DAD.
DON'T PAY ME ANY MIND.
I JUST CAME DOWN HERE
TO FIND A QUIET PLACE TO READ MY PAPER.
THAT'S ALL.
SONDRA, WOULD YOU PLEASE PASS ME THE MARKER?
THANK YOU.
WOULD YOU LIKE IT BACK, SONDRA?
NO, ELVIN
I WOULD NOT LIKE IT BACK.
DR. HUXTABLE
YOU SHOULD KNOW--
SONDRA'S UPSET WITH ME.
AGAIN?
DADDY, YOU KNOW HOW ELVIN IS ALWAYS LATE?
AND HOW YOU ALWAYS GET ANGRY WITH HIM WHEN HE'S LATE.
TODAY I DECIDED TO TEACH HIM A LESSON.
I PICKED HIM UP TWO HOURS LATE
SO HE'D KNOW HOW IT FEELS.
AND HE DIDN'T GET MAD!
WHEN SHE WAS LATE, I ASSUMED SHE HAD A GOOD REASON.
I TOLD YOU THAT I WAS LATE FOR NO REASON AT ALL.
I WAS GLAD YOU WERE OKAY.
BUT YOU NEVER GET MAD.
DADDY
IT THREATENS OUR RELATIONSHIP.
ELVIN'S OUT OF TOUCH WITH HIS ANGER.
I'M AFRAID SONDRA'S RIGHT, DR. HUXTABLE.
I'VE NEVER GOTTEN ANGRY IN MY LIFE.
HOWEVER, PEOPLE DO TEND TO GET VERY ANGRY WITH ME.
ELVIN, YOUR INABILITY TO EXPRESS YOUR ANGER
IS IN ITSELF A FORM OF HOSTILITY.
DADDY, HE IS A CLASSIC PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
DON'T AGREE WITH ME!
GET MAD AT ME!
I CALLED YOU A PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE.
I'M SURE YOU HAD A GOOD REASON.
YOU KNOW, DR. HUXTABLE...
IF I COULD GET ANGRY, THIS WOULDN'T HAPPEN.
I'M REALLY SORRY TO GET YOU INVOLVED IN THIS.
NO, NO.
IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE PROBABLY PEAKING ON ANGER IN YOUR BIORHYTHMS.
WHAT?
WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK OUT
EVENTUALLY YOU WILL.
THANKS, DR. HUXTABLE.
SONDRA, DO YOU CARE ENOUGH ABOUT ME
TO TRY TO WORK IT OUT?
NO, ELVIN, I DON'T.
OKAY, I UNDERSTAND.
ELVIN, I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.
I CARE ABOUT YOU A GREAT DEAL.
I SAID THAT TO MAKE YOU MAD.
OH.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK ON THIS.
YOU'RE GOING TO WORK ON IT NOW?
IT'S IMPORTANT TO EXAMINE THESE EMOTIONS
WHILE WE'RE IN THE MOMENT.
OKAY, HONEY.
ALL RIGHT, DEAR.
ELVIN, YOU CAN STRAIGHTEN ALL THIS UP FOR TWO DOLLARS.
HI.
HI!
HI, DADDY.
HI, DR. HUXTABLE.
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO HAVE PERMISSION
TO SIT UP HERE AND WATCH TV?
MOMMY SAID WE COULD.
SHE DID?
YES.
SHE SAID IF WE WERE QUIET WHILE YOU WERE ASLEEP
WHEN YOU GOT UP, WE COULD WATCH TV HERE.
YOU SLEPT A LONG TIME.
WANT TO WATCH CARTOONS WITH US?
NO, THANK YOU.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
I DON'T KNOW.
(* MUSIC *)

WHO IS IT?

HOW DO I KNOW IT ISN'T ONE OF MY CHILDREN

DR. HUXTABLE?
I'M IN HERE WITH A PATIENT RIGHT NOW.
I'M GETTING READY TO DELIVER A BABY.
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.
NO, IT CAN'T BE THAT IMPORTANT
BECAUSE THE WOMAN IS GOING TO DELIVER ANY SECOND NOW.
SO YOU HAVE TO GO BACK UPSTAIRS.
HI, DR. HUXTABLE.
HI, MRS. HUXTABLE.
EDDIE WAS GOING TO GIVE ME A RIDE HOME
BUT HE CAN'T BECAUSE YOUR CAR IS BLOCKING HIS CAR
IN THE DRIVEWAY.

VANESSA AND I ARE GOING TO A SCHOOL DANCE.
IT'S NOT A FORMAL
BUT WE LIKE TO LOOK GOOD.
SONDRA AND I ARE TAKING RUDY TO SEE THE ALVIN AILEY DANCE COMPANY.
EDDIE, ARE YOU TAKING DENISE OUT?

USED TO DO THAT MYSELF WHEN I WENT TO THE DANCES

I'D TAKE THE MASCARA PENCIL

COCKROACH:
IT'S THEM!
DAD, PLEASE DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
DON'T SAY ANYTHING?
I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU.

I NEVER SAID...
I'LL DO ANYTHING.
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, DAD.
YOU KNOW ME.
I KNOW YOU!
PLEASE, DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

NICE TO MEET YOU.
I MUST TELL YOU
THAT YOU ARE GOING OUT WITH SOME VERY MANLY MEN.
YEAH.
OH, YES...
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE.

OF COURSE, BY THIS TIME NOW
THIS IS NOT NEWS.
MAY I TURN ON THE TV?
YOU MAY TURN ON OUR TV.
THANK YOU.
A WEEK BEFORE MATING, THE MALE PERUVIAN SAND CRICKET

There are some places in this world that are a lot easier to get into than out of... like East Berlin, for instance.
I mean, look at me.
I'm dying to leave.
So far, so good.
But the next part's where it could get a little touchy.
My grief-stricken mourners here to lend a helping hand.
Gettin' a little warm in here.
- Open the gate
- Vorsicht!
Kannst du bitte helfen?
Danke schoen.
Hier Kontrol.
Ja wohl!
Ja wohl!
Ja wohl!
Huh-oh.
Sounds like trouble.
I guess this makes me about the first guy who ever attended his own funeral and lived to tell about it.

We have reviewed your proposal.
Yes, sir!
It is correct in every detail.
We have had assurances like this from you in the past, Quayle, particularly where they concern MacGyver.
MacGyver is the only blemish on my records, gentlemen.
- I have never failed you in anything except...
- We know that dreary story, Quayle.
He made a fool of you.
Of us.
He was lucky.
Extremely lucky.
And I admit I underestimated him.
But this time I'm ready for him.
I can guarantee you success.
You guarantee?
To neutralize the information he took from us in East Berlin?
Absolutely.
Promises.
Always promises.
We must have results.
We must prevent that information from reaching American intelligence.
- Consider it done.
- And suppose you fail again?
I won't.
I see you remember what happened to you after your last failure.
Yes, sir.
I remember.
Then let that memory be an inspiration, Quayle.
Let it guide you in your efforts.
What he means, Quayle, is this is your chance for redemption.
And it's definitely your last chance.
- I understand -- thank you, sir.
- Good.
It is the decision of this tribunal to authorize your operation...based on your personal guarantee.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you!
You won't regret it.
I appreciate the opportunity to redeem myself in your eyes, to reestablish my value in the cause...
Better get started, Quayle.
Our sources have traced MacGyver halfway around the world.
He's about to return home.
I'll be waiting.
Baby!
You look terrific!
Boy, is it good to see you!
What a sight!
Especially with the three heavies that are setting you up for a hit.
Peter Thornton sent me.
How's the General?
Generally good, except Thornton is a colonel.
And he asked me to remind you that he owes you a camel.
And you came all the way down here just to tell me that?
Oh, sweet Lulubelle.
I love this girl!
I love her!
She's great!
I love, I love her!
You'd love her, too.
- Let's go, Lulubelle.
- Name's Karen Blake.
Look more like a Lulubelle to me.
So how's Peter?
Waiting for you.
So hold on, lover!
- Aren't we goin' to Pete's office?
- No, he set up a special safe house.
You been with the Company long?
- Why?
- Well, I thought I knew all the pretty girls in the office.
Business must be good.
Since when do safe houses look like this?
Look, I was just told to bring you here for a high-level debriefing.
High level lives in high places.
I've just got one question.
- Hey, I'm only a courier.
- I'm only hungry.
When do we eat?
Good to see you again...
MacGyver.
Quaint.
We thought so.
Pete!
- Great!
- Good to see you!
And I thought all secret agents were cold and heartless.
No, Pete and I go way back to some pretty funny places.
Is that what the camel was about?
Well, the first time I met this fella, he pulled me out of the quicksand in the Wadi Nefud.
Deep desert.
Then he put me on a camel and he gave it this gigantic swat.
Ha!
- What happened?
- Oh, we just rode on out.
Yeah, for six days.
I couldn't sit easy for a week.
Anyway, it's good to see you.
And congratulations.
You had some problems getting out of East Berlin.
Uh, yeah.
Had some real unfriendlies waitin' for me.
- I sorta had to cut and run for the border.
- Turned a coffin into a jet ski.
Yeah, that part was fun.
I had a real good time.
- Me and, uh, junior here.
- That is very important.
So, thanks.
You're welcome.
And congratulations to yourself.
I heard...
Deputy Chief of the Department.
Big deal.
- You can call me sir.
- Yeah, I noticed.
This place?
Yeah, it's been out of use for quite a while.
Off the list and unofficial...
which is exactly what we need.
It seems we have a very large hole in departmental security.
- What leaked?
- Your name.
And what you brought back.
- Terrific.
- So I'm handling it personally from here on.
Here, now, and quietly.
My own office doesn't even know we're here.
- No one does.
It's perfect.
- Yes, it is.
- Right in here.
- Cozy.
Thought you'd appreciate it.
And in a way it fits.
We are hunting big game.
Dangerous game.
You know Mrs.Chung?
By reputation.
It's a pleasure.
How do you do?
The best crypt analyst alive.
Oh, Peter, stop it!
He's a politician.
I solve puzzles.
And, uh, I understand you have brought us one today.
Yes, Ma'am.
Should I be here, sir?
Oh yes, we're all staying right here until Mrs. Chung decodes the microfilm.
Thank you.
This computer is fully programmed for our system, MacGyver.
Well, that's fine with me.
I just came for lunch.
I have not activated it!
What in hell is this?
A joke, Peter.
Trick or treat.
It's April Fool's.
Peter!
Peter!
Don't touch that door!
Hello, MacGyver.
Long time no see.
Make the lady comfortable and don't worry about her, MacGyver.
She's not dead, only sedated.
He knows you.
Who is he?
Use the name Quayle.
Sold the British out to the Russians.
Double-crossed the Russians for the Ayatollah.
Ah ha ha, those dear fun days.
I ran into him movin' a planeload of stolen military computers.
What happened?
Uh, I stole the plane back.
Your people weren't too happy with you, huh, Quayle?
No, they punished me...because of you.
But now, this is my game, my board, my rules.
Security leak a little bigger than you thought?
As big as a house.
- For this?
- No, no, no.
No, I was commissioned to destroy it and deal with you.
No!
Frightened, Karen?
All in a day's work.
And in your case, with great pleasure, MacGyver.
Peter Thornton here.
Don't be stupid!
But do be adventurous!
Try to escape.
Try to find me!
Please!
Don't touch anything, Peter.
- What do you mean?
- Ah, he's got the whole place rigged.
- To kill us?
- Yeah.
Sooner or later.
- First the man wants to have some fun.
- MacGyver, that's crazy!
- So is Quayle.
- His gears don't mesh.
Let's see if we can get outta here.
Maybe he's missed a trick or two.
I don't wanna leave Mrs.Chung back there very long.
The best thing we can do for her is to get to Karen's car and get some help.
No!
Where's my car?
Damn!
It's gone!
- Well, that's scary stuff.
- The door has got to be booby-trapped.
Yeah.
Let's see if we can figure out how.
It's not electrified.
- I don't believe it.
- I don't either.
- Gonna run a test, huh?
- Yeah.
A hit, MacGyver!
A palpable hit!
You always did like to talk, didn't ya, Quayle?
Karen, give me that sheet.
It's an incredible weakness of yours.
Kitchen.
Always had to say how great you were, didn't ya, Quayle?
- Afraid maybe people wouldn't notice.
- You'll be the last one to die.
That's what I figure, too.
Of old age, hopefully.
- Well, here it is.
- Why here?
You can find lots of handy stuff in the kitchen.
Let's look around.
Still with us, big guy?
You certainly are talented, Quayle.
- I mean, this guy has got it!
- Got us, you mean!
Like pigeons in a coop.
Like rats in a trap.
I have never been nailed down so tight in my entire life.
Your appreciation is not wasted, MacGyver.
Quayle...
Take your bows, gent.
It's not every day I run into pure perfection.
Let's just say you were my perfect challenge.
Yeah, you certainly have met that challenge.
He is definitely back at the top of his form.
A new chess game with a new master, MacGyver.
You got that straight.
Brilliance, Quayle.
Pure brilliance.
Compliment acknowledged, but you aren't going to give up so easily, are you?
What's that fidgeting you're up to?
Messing around with pots and pans won't help you.
So why don't you just put away the tinker toys...
- ...and play the game?
- Absolutely.
Positively.
Let the games begin.
Quayle was listening on a radio frequency, so I figured by using every electronic gadget around,
I could heterodyne his frequency and give the man an earful of static.
- MacGyver!
- You built an electronic jammer!
Yep!
Quayle's gonna get nothin' but white noise.So we got a little privacy in here.
All right, I figure if we split up and keep movin' around this house, I can find a way to bust out while he's not lookin'.
- Keep him busy tracking the three of us?
- My radiophone!
It's in the library in my case.
- If I can get to it without Quayle watching.
- Nice touch.
Okay, here we go.
One at a time.
Keep him guessing.
Stay low, move fast, think smart, and...
- ...if you go, take company along.
- Get outta here!
Deputy Chief Peter Thornton.
Red.
Red.
Repeat, red.
Red.
Details...
But I already know the details, Peter.
Now I guess it's my turn to go out and distract Quayle.
Hey... it's gonna be all right.
We're gonna make it.
Heh, thanks, I needed that.
Come on, let's get outta here.
Whatta you say?
Quayle was a thorough kind of guy, so it figured he had all the windows and doors either booby-trapped or covered by the guns outside.
But maybe I could make myself a set of wheels that'd draw his fire...get me outta this homemade prison.
I'm listening to your symphony, MacGyver.
Or is it a requiem?
When I was a kid, I used to build model planes with rubber band motors.
Then I discovered batteries.
It sure did increase the mileage.
Ah, my dear Karen.
Welcome to my fortress.
It's going rather well, don't you think?
Well, Quayle, I really didn't expect all this to be happening.
I mean, you said this was gonna be over quickly.
It will be.
But you mustn't deny me my brief moment of fun.
Fun?
I'm shaking!
Are you afraid they might find you out?
Who could suspect such a darling innocent?
But this MacGyver is, is very smart.
And Thornton is no dummy either.
Yes, that's what makes you my, uh, what shall I call you?
My little mole.
No, that's far too unflattering.
My perfect collaborator in this delicious charade.
I'm telling you, Quayle, I'm scared...of them and of you.
You said that we were just gonna do a simple job without hurt.
I'm just teasing.
Just toying with them.
- But Mrs.Chung is down...
- She's a stranger.
There's someone much closer to you that you ought to be worried about.
All right.
I'll do what you say.
Perfect!
Now what is MacGyver doing in the kitchen?
When I left him, he was taking the motor out of a blender.
Ah, yes, that's the handyman side of MacGyver.
He likes to make clever little things out of odd bits.
- But I must have more details.
- I must know exactly what he is doing!
- I'll go see.
- Yes, you do that, my dear.
No time to waste.
The sooner we deal with MacGyver, the sooner this'll be over.
There's my perfect collaborator.
Stay in touch.
What sort of a fantasy is MacGyver indulging?
Answer me, Karen.
Are you there?
Yes.
He's at the, uh, rear kitchen door and he's built some kind of wheeled cart with a piece of the suit of armor on top.
It's the position I care about!
He'll be coming out of the back door...
And I'll be waiting for him.
Very good, Karen.
- What're you gonna do?
- Dear...
Sweet Karen, I only intend to embarrass them painfully...even MacGyver.
Especially MacGyver.
Obviously the guns are target to shoot at a given height, at anything that moves.
But they can't shoot in two directions at once, so if I can get 'em aiming down there...
Quayle!
I think he's gotten clear.
Don't worry...
I'll get him back, Karen.
MacGyver, come back!
I've got Thornton!
You want to see Thornton alive?
Now is the time.
He's waiting for you in the trophy room.
I've turned my guns off so you can come back.
The game is not over...yet.
He's coming back to us, Karen.
But did I detect a note of concern for MacGyver?
We can't afford a major incident, like a multiple-VIP murder.
Look, my orders are to retrieve a piece of intelligence, not to carry out your damned blood feud!
I give the orders, my girl!
And I'm ordering you to the trophy room.
You can get the roll of film from Thornton there.
Now get going before MacGyver gets there!
Thornton's not gonna give it to me!
He won't object.
I've given him the shock of his life.
- Now go on, girl!
- Right.
He's dead!
Electrocuted!
- He's not dead.
- Oh my God!
I thought...
She's still the same.
They'll both be all right if we get 'em help in time.
Yeah.
MacGyver, I know you would've gotten away.
It's all right.
I changed my mind anyway.
If I get away, Quayle gets away.
And I want him.
Let's go somewhere where we can't be seen or heard.
Quayle's got the house rigged electronically.
The main power line which is probably in the basement.
I saw some vinegar here.
Yeah.
Now if we can cut or control that power line, Quayle goes deaf, dumb and blind.
He loses his edge.
MacGyver, what the hell are we doing?
- Making some preparations.
- MacGyver!
/
- Thank you.
Now you want to tell me if Quayle hired you locally or were you assigned to him?
It was an assignment.
How did you know?
Well, first of all, you were a little too quick and cool gettin' me out of that hit.
Now the hit men didn't even try to follow.
Secondly, you took one look at Pete from across the room and assessed that he'd been electrocuted.
You're very quick, MacGyver.
Not quick enough to save Pete from a pretty good jolt.
- It could've killed him, you know.
- I was told no killing.
Only that we would get the film back.
Why draw the line at murder?
Quayle doesn't.
I didn't know that!
I've never worked with him before.
- I told you they assigned me.
- For how much?
How much money they givin' ya to betray your country?
Huh?
Money?
It's not -
- I wouldn't do it for money!
Look, I've never done anything like this before.
Oh, please, don't tell me you're one of those political mal...
They've got my brother!
He works for Mr.Thornton, too.
For the Company.
But he was on assignment in Czechoslovakia and he got caught.
And they said they would kill him unless...
Unless you cooperated.
Work for them.
There's another way, Karen.
You don't have to give into their blackmail.
But my brother, he's my only family.
Help me catch Quayle.
We'll use him as a bargaining chip.
- Trade Quayle for your brother.
- What if they won't?
Then I'll go in and get him.
Personally.
You would do that for me after...everything?
Will you help me?
What do you want me to do?
Well, I think we should start by forcing Quayle out of his electronic fortress.
- How?
- By unplugging all his gadgets.
We've gotta get to the power room in the basement.
Let's go.
He could be anywhere.
Or everywhere.
You thought I couldn't track you, MacGyver.
Well, we all make mistakes.
This one is, I'm afraid, fatal.
- Quayle!
- Goodbye, Karen.
I'll try to arrange a posthumous medal.
Watch the moving dot.
Whatever it touches, it kills.
- Damn!
- Closer and closer.
I could hit you at any time.
These are your last moments.
So enjoy them.
My daddy used to say you can't hit what you can't see.
A smokescreen.
That won't save you.
Now we're invisible.
Okay, follow me.
Come on.
The back stairs where Quayle can't see or hear us.
Damn it!
MacGyver!
Karen!
There really is no escape.
MacGyver!
I know where Quayle is.
He's down that corridor to the right.
His control room is down at the end.
The door is steel.
He's got a lot of security and weapons.
All right.
Maybe it's time for him to come out and play.
Hey!
I've got an idea.
Let's make an early warning system.
It'll let us know when Quayle's on the way.
And what makes you so sure Quayle's gonna leave his control room?
It's the only way to get to the power room.
Right?
Well, if we can cut off his electricity, he's bound to come lookin' for us.
Easy.
What're you gonna do?
Invite the man to a party.
- Rusted junk machinery...
I don't get it.
- Line it up, Karen.
Sorta casual clutter.
What're you doing?
Those wires look like spaghetti.
Well, I traced all the heavy wiring into Quayle's fortress.
- So?
- I'm gonna punch his lights out.
Keep stacking' that junk.
When Quayle comes in here, he's gotta walk forward only one way.
Oh, how's this?
Perfect.
Primrose path.
Pull that cabinet over, too, will ya?
You know, I sure could use a mirror.
Think you could find me one?
Yeah, just what I want to do is look in a mirror right now.
Okay, okay, I'll go find a mirror.
- That's perfect.
That's just what we need.
- So now we've got a mirror.
Yeah, sort of.
Come here.
Stand right here.
Don't move.
Oh, I see.
So you're making a periscope so we can see Quayle, right?
Yeah, that's right.
Without being seen.
- Why?
- Because he'd probably blow us away.
Where are you?
You can't escape.
I'll find you.
I'll find you.
And we've got a mirror.
And a kind of water cannon.
I don't wanna lose pressure.
The problem we're gonna have, though, is gettin' him in and standing right there.
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Where are they?
Nothing!
Nothing!
Why aren't I finding them?
We'll keep the lights on in here and in the corridor.
And so...this must be his power.
Power failure.
Auxiliary generator.
Your handy work, I suppose, MacGyver.
Damn it!
You're right, MacGyver.
No more games.
MacGyver...
That was just in case.
Nice thought.
Out in clear sight now.
Quayle!
Thank God you found us!
MacGyver was setting a trap.
- I thought I could trust you.
- We're on the same side, huh, Quayle?
I'm a geometric rarity, my dear.
There's only one side.
Myself.
Gosh, Quayle, and all this time I thought you were just scum.
This one's free of charge.
- You took a big chance trusting me.
- That's what it's all about.
All right, let's wrap him up and see how the rest are doin', all right?
Okay.
Yes, I think we've plugged the leak.
Quayle.
That's right.
I'm sorry.
Now where were we?
Oh yes, solving a puzzle.
That's okay, Mrs.Chung. I think we just took care of that.
There are some places in this world that are a lot easier to get into than out of... like East Berlin, for instance.
I mean, look at me.
I'm dying to leave.
So far, so good.
But the next part's where it could get a little touchy.
My grief-stricken mourners here to lend a helping hand.
Getting a little warm in here.
Jawohl.
Jawohl!
Jawohl!
Uh-oh.
Sounds of trouble.
I guess this makes me about the first guy who ever attended his own funeral and lived to tell about it.
We have reviewed your proposal.
Yes, sir.
It is correct in every detail.
We have had assurances like this from you in the past, Quayle, particularly where they concern MacGyver.
MacGyver is the only blemish on my records, gentlemen.
I have never failed you in anything except...
We know that dreary story, Quayle.
He made a fool of you.
Of us.
He was lucky.
Extremely lucky.
And I admit I underestimated him.
But this time, I'm ready for him.
I can guarantee you success.
You guarantee to neutralize the information he took from us in East Berlin?
Absolutely.
Promises, always promises.
We must have results.
We must prevent that information from reaching American intelligence.
Consider it done.
And suppose you fail again?
I won't.
I see you remember what happened to you after your last failure.
Yes, sir.
I remember.
Then let that memory be an inspiration, Quayle.
Let it guide you in your efforts.
What he means, Quayle, is this is your chance for redemption.
And it is definitely your last chance.
I understand.
Thank you, sir.
Good.
It is the decision of this tribunal to authorize your operation... based on your personal guarantee.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you!
You won't regret it.
I appreciate the opportunity to redeem myself in your eyes, to reestablish my value in the cause...
Better get started, Quayle.
Our sources have traced MacGyver halfway around the world.
He's about to return home.
I'll be waiting.
Baby!
You look terrific!
Boy, is it good to see you!
What a sight!
Especially with the three heavies that are setting you up for a hit.
Peter Thornton sent me.
How's the General?
Generally good, except Thornton is a colonel.
And he asked me to remind you that he owes you a camel.
And you've came all the way down here just to tell me that?
Oh, sweet Lulubelle.
I love this girl!
I love her!
She's great!
I love, I love her!
You'd love her, too.
Let's go, Lulubelle.
Name's Karen Blake.
Look more like a Lulubelle to me.
So, how's Peter?
Waiting for you.
So, hold on, lover.
Aren't we going to Pete's office?
No, he set up a special safe house.
You been with the Company long?
Why?
Well, I thought I knew all the pretty girls in the office.
Business must be good.
Since when do safe houses look like this?
Look, I was just told to bring you here for a high-level debriefing.
High level lives in high places.

MacGyver.
Quaint.
We thought so.
Pete!
All right!
Good to see you!
And I thought all secret agents were cold and heartless.
No, Pete and I go way back to some pretty funny places.
Is that what the camel was about?
Well, the first time I met this fella, he pulled me out of the quicksand in the Wadi Nefud.
Deep desert.
Then he put me on a camel, and he gave it this gigantic swat.
Ha!
What happened?
Oh, we just rode on out.
Yeah, for six days.
I couldn't sit easy for a week.
Anyway, it's good to see you.
And congratulations.
You had some problems getting out of East Berlin.
Uh, yeah.
Had some real unfriendlies waitin' for me.
I sort of had to cut and run for the border.
Turned a coffin into a jet ski.
Yeah, that part was fun.
I had a real good time.
Me and, uh, junior here.

You'll be the last one to die.

Of old age, hopefully.
Well, here it is.
Why here?
You can find lots of handy stuff in the kitchen.
Let's look around.
Still with us, big guy?

Got us, you mean.
Like pigeons in a coop.

I have never been nailed down so tight in my entire life.
Your appreciation is not wasted, MacGyver.
Quayle, take your bows, gent.
It's not every day I run into pure perfection.

Messing around with pots and pans won't help you.
So why don't you just put away the tinker toys and play the game?
Absolutely.
Positively.
Let the games begin.
Quayle was listening on a radio frequency, so I figured by using every electronic gadget around,
I could heterodyne his frequency, give the man an earful of static.
MacGyver.
You built an electronic jammer.
Yup.
Quayle's gonna get nothin' but white noise.
So we got a little privacy in here.
All right,
I figure if we split up and keep movin' around this house,
I can find a way to bust out while he's not lookin'.
Keep him busy tracking the three of us?
My radiophone... it's in the library in my case.
If I can get to it without Quayle watching...
Nice touch.
Okay, here we go.
One at a time.
Keep him guessing.
Stay low, move fast, think smart.
And if you go, And if you go, take company along.
Get out of here.
You know, MacGyver, when I was little,
I used to play international spy.
I think we all did, didn't we?
Oh, I'd be wearing a designer gown and going to some great party at Buckingham Palace, meeting a Russian ambassador.
And I would get him to tell me all his secrets.
Maybe that's why
I went to work for the Department.
Deputy Chief Peter Thornton.
Red.
Red.
Repeat, red, red.
Details...
But I already know the details, Peter.
Now I guess it's my turn to go out and distract Quayle.
Hey... it's gonna be all right.
We're gonna make it.
Thanks, I needed that.
Come on, let's get out of here.
What do you say?
Quayle was a thorough kind of guy, so it figured he had all the windows and doors either booby-trapped or covered by the guns outside.
But maybe I could make myself a set of wheels that'd draw his fire and get me out of this homemade prison.
I'm listening to your symphony, MacGyver.
Or is it a requiem?
When I was a kid,
I used to build model planes with rubber band motors.
Then I discovered batteries.
It sure did increase the mileage.
Ah, my dear Karen.
Welcome to my fortress.
It's going rather well, don't you think?
Well, Quayle, I-I really didn't expect all this to be happening.
I mean, you said this was going to be over quickly.
Well, it will be.
But you mustn't deny me my brief moment of fun.
"Fun"?
I'm shaking!
Are you afraid they might find you out?
Who could suspect such a darling innocent?
But this MacGyver is -is very smart.
And Thornton is no dummy either.
Yes, that's what makes you my, um, what shall I call you?
My little mole.
No, that's far too unflattering.
My perfect collaborator in this... delicious charade.
I'm telling you, Quayle, I'm scared-- of them and of you.
You said that we were just going to do a simple job without hurt.
I'm just teasing.
Just toying with them.
But Mrs. Chung is down...
She's a stranger.
There's someone much closer to you that you ought to be worried about, isn't there?
All right.
I'll do what you say, but...
Perfect.
Now, what is MacGyver doing in the kitchen?
When I left him, he was taking the motor out of a blender.
Ah, yes, that's the handyman side of MacGyver.
He likes to make clever little things out of odd bits.
But I must have more details.
I must know exactly what he is doing!
I'll go see.
Yes, you do that, my dear.
No time to waste.
The sooner we deal with MacGyver, the sooner this'll be over.
There's my perfect collaborator.
Stay in touch.
What sort of a fantasy is MacGyver indulging?
Answer me, Karen.
Are you there?
Yes.
He's at the, uh, rear kitchen door, and he's built some kind of wheeled cart with a piece of the suit of armor on top.
It's the position I care about.
He'll be coming out of the back door... and I'll be waiting for him.
Very good, Karen.
What are you going to do?
My dear... sweet Karen,
I only intend to embarrass them painfully... even MacGyver.
Especially MacGyver.
Help.
Obviously the guns are targeted to shoot at a given height, at anything that moves.
But they can't shoot in two directions at once, so if I can get them aiming down there...
Quayle?
I think he's gotten clear.
Not to worry.
I'll get him back, Karen.
MacGyver, come back!
I've got Thornton!
If you want to see Thornton alive, now is the time.
He's waiting for you in the trophy room.
I've turned my guns off so you can come back.
The game is not over... yet.
He's coming back to us, Karen.
But did I detect a note of concern for MacGyver?
We can't afford a major incident like a multiple-V.I.P. murder.
Look, my orders are to retrieve a piece of intelligence, not to carry out your damned blood feud.
I give the orders, my girl.
And I'm ordering you to the trophy room.
You can get the roll of film from Thornton there.
Now, get going before MacGyver gets there!
Thornton's not going to give it to me.
He won't object.
I've given him the shock of his life.
Now, go on, girl!
Right.
He's dead.
Electrocuted.
He's not dead.
Oh, my God.
I thought...
She's still the same.
They'll both be all right if we get them help in time.
Yeah.
MacGyver,
I know you would have gotten away.
It's all right.
I changed my mind, anyway.
If I get away, Quayle gets away.
And I want him.
Let's go somewhere where we can't be seen or heard.
Quayle's got the house rigged electronically through the main power line which is probably in the basement.
I saw some vinegar here.
Yeah.
Now, if we can cut or control that power line,
Quayle goes deaf, dumb and blind.
He loses his edge.
MacGyver, what the hell are we doing?
Making some preparations.
MacGyver!
Thank you.
Now, you want to tell me if Quayle hired you locally, or were you assigned to him?
It was an assignment.
How did you know?
Well, first of all, you were a little too quick and cool getting me out of that hit.
And the hit men didn't even try to follow.
Secondly, you took one look at Pete from across the room, and assessed that he had been electrocuted.
You're very quick, MacGyver.
Not quick enough to save Pete from a pretty good jolt.
You could have killed him, you know.
I was told no killing.
Only that we would...
get the film back.
Why draw the line at murder?
Quayle doesn't.
I didn't know that.
I've never worked with him before.
I told you, they assigned me.
For how much?
How much money they giving you to betray your country, huh?
Money?
It's not...
I wouldn't do it for money!
Look, I have never done anything like this before.
Oh, please, don't tell me you're one of those political mal...
They've got my brother!
He works for Mr. Thornton, too.
For the Company.
But he was on assignment in Czechoslovakia, and he got caught.
And they said they would kill him unless...
Unless you cooperated.
Worked for them.
There's another way, Karen.
You don't have to give in to their blackmail.
But my brother-- he's my only family.
Help me catch Quayle.
We'll use him as a bargaining chip.
Trade Quayle for your brother.
What if they won't?
Then I'll go in and get him...
personally.
You would do that for me after... everything?
Will you help me?
What do you want me to do?
Well, I think we should start by forcing Quayle out of his electronic fortress.
How?
By unplugging all his gadgets.
We've got to get to the power room in the basement.
Let's go.
He could be anywhere.
Or everywhere.
You thought I couldn't track you, MacGyver.
Well, we all make mistakes.
This one is, I'm afraid, fatal.
Quayle!
Good-bye, Karen.
I'll try to arrange a posthumous medal.
Watch the moving dot.
Whatever it touches, it kills.
Damn!
Closer and closer.
I could hit you at any time.
These are your last moments.
So, enjoy them.
My daddy used to say you can't hit what you can't see.
A smokescreen.
That won't save you.
Now we're invisible.
Okay.
Follow me.
Come on.
The back stairs, where Quayle can't see or hear us.
Damn it!
MacGyver!
Karen!
There really is no escape.
MacGyver,
I know where Quayle is.
He's down that corridor to the right.
His control room is down at the end.
The door is steel.
He's got a lot of security and weapons.
All right.
Maybe it's time for him to come out and play.
Hey...
I've got an idea.
Let's make an early warning system.
It'll let us know when Quayle's on the way.
What makes you so sure
Quayle's gonna leave his control room?
It's the only way to get to the power room, right?
Uh-huh.
Well, if we can cut off his electricity, he's bound to come looking for us.
Easy.
What are you gonna do?
Invite the man to a party.
Rusted junk machinery...
I don't get it.
Line it up, Karen.
Sort of casual clutter.
What are you doing?
Those wires look like spaghetti.
Well, I traced all the heavy wiring into Quayle's fortress.
So?
I'm gonna punch his lights out.
Keep stacking that junk.
When Quayle comes in here, he's gotta walk forward only one way.
How's this?
Perfect.
Primrose path.
Pull that cabinet over, too, will you?
You know, I sure could use a mirror.
Think you could find me one?
Yeah, just what I want to do is look in a mirror right now.
Okay, okay, I'll go find a mirror.
That's perfect.
It's just what we need.
So now we've got a mirror.
Yeah, sort of.
Come here.
Stand right here.
Don't move.
Oh, I see.
So you're making a periscope so we can see Quayle, right?
Yeah, that's right.
Without being seen.
Why?
Because he'd probably blow us away.
Where are you?
You can't escape.
I'll find you.
I'll find you.
And we've got a mirror.
And a kind of water cannon.
I don't want to lose pressure.
The problem we're gonna have, though, is getting him in and standing right there.
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Where are they?
Nothing!
Nothing!
Why aren't I finding them?
We'll keep the lights on in here and in the corridor.
And so... this must be his power.
Power failure?
Auxiliary generator.
Your handy work, I suppose, MacGyver.
Damn it!
All right, MacGyver.
No more games.
MacGyver...
That was... just in case.
Nice thought.
Out in clear sight now.
Quayle!
Thank God you found us.
MacGyver was setting a trap.
I thought I could trust you.
We're on the same side, right, Quayle?
I'm a geometric rarity, my dear.
There's only one side.
Myself.
Gosh, Quayle, and all this time
I thought you were just... scum.
This one's free of charge.
Ow!
You took a big chance trusting me.
That's what it's all about.
All right, let's wrap him up and see how the rest are doing, all right?
Okay.
Yes, I think we've plugged the leak.
Quayle.
That's right.
I'm sorry.
Now... where were we?
Oh, yes, solving a puzzle.
That's okay, Mrs. Chung.
I think we just took care of that.
There are some places in this world that are a lot easier to get into than out of... like East Berlin, for instance.
I mean, look at me.
I'm dying to leave.
So far, so good.
But the next part's where it could get a little touchy.
My grief-stricken mourners here to lend a helping hand.
Gettin' a little warm in here.
- Open the gate
- Vorsicht!
Kannst du bitte helfen?
Danke schoen.
Hier Kontrol.
Ja wohl!
Ja wohl!
Ja wohl!
Huh-oh.
Sounds like trouble.
I guess this makes me about the first guy who ever attended his own funeral and lived to tell about it.
M A C G Y V E R Episode 1x12 DEATHLOCK
We have reviewed your proposal.
Yes, sir!
It is correct in every detail.
We have had assurances like this from you in the past, Quayle, particularly where they concern MacGyver.
MacGyver is the only blemish on my records, gentlemen.
- I have never failed you in anything except...
- We know that dreary story, Quayle.
He made a fool of you.
Of us.
He was lucky.
Extremely lucky.
And I admit I underestimated him.
But this time I'm ready for him.
I can guarantee you success.
You guarantee?
To neutralize the information he took from us in East Berlin?
Absolutely.
Promises.
Always promises.
We must have results.
We must prevent that information from reaching American intelligence.
- Consider it done.
- And suppose you fail again?
I won't.
I see you remember what happened to you after your last failure.
Yes, sir.
I remember.
Then let that memory be an inspiration, Quayle.
Let it guide you in your efforts.
What he means, Quayle, is this is your chance for redemption.
And it's definitely your last chance.
- I understand - thank you, sir.
- Good.
It is the decision of this tribunal to authorize your operation... based on your personal guarantee.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you!
You won't regret it.
I appreciate the opportunity to redeem myself in your eyes, to reestablish my value in the cause...
Better get started, Quayle.
Our sources have traced MacGyver halfway around the world.
He's about to return home.
I'll be waiting.
Baby!
You look terrific!
Boy, is it good to see you!
What a sight!
Especially with the three heavies that are setting you up for a hit.
Peter Thornton sent me.
How's the General?
Generally good, except Thornton is a colonel.
And he asked me to remind you that he owes you a camel.
And you came all the way down here just to tell me that?
Oh, sweet Lulubelle.
I love this girl!
I love her!
She's great!
I love, I love her!
You'd love her, too.
- Let's go, Lulubelle.
- Name's Karen Blake.
Look more like a Lulubelle to me.
So how's Peter?
Waiting for you.
So hold on, lover!
- Aren't we goin' to Pete's office?
- No, he set up a special safe house.
You been with the Company long?
- Why?
- Well, I thought I knew all the pretty girls in the office.
Business must be good.
Since when do safe houses look like this?
Look, I was just told to bring you here for a high-level debriefing.
High level lives in high places.
I've just got one question.
- Hey, I'm only a courier.
- I'm only hungry.
When do we eat?
Good to see you again...
MacGyver.
Quaint.
We thought so.
Pete!
- Great!
- Good to see you!
And I thought all secret agents were cold and heartless.
No, Pete and I go way back to some pretty funny places.
Is that what the camel was about?
Well, the first time I met this fella, he pulled me out of the quicksand in the Wadi Nefud.
Deep desert.
Then he put me on a camel and he gave it this gigantic swat.
Ha!
- What happened?
- Oh, we just rode on out.
Yeah, for six days.
I couldn't sit easy for a week.
Anyway, it's good to see you.
And congratulations.
You had some problems getting out of East Berlin.
Uh, yeah.
Had some real unfriendlies waitin' for me.
- I sorta had to cut and run for the border.
- Turned a coffin into a jet ski.
Yeah, that part was fun.
I had a real good time.
- Me and, uh, junior here.
- That is very important.
So, thanks.
You're welcome.
And congratulations to yourself.
I heard...
Deputy Chief of the Department.
Big deal.
- You can call me sir.
- Yeah, I noticed.
This place?
Yeah, it's been out of use for quite a while.
Off the list and unofficial...
which is exactly what we need.
It seems we have a very large hole in departmental security.
- What leaked?
- Your name.
And what you brought back.
- Terrific.
- So I'm handling it personally from here on.
Here, now, and quietly.
My own office doesn't even know we're here.
- No one does.
It's perfect.
- Yes, it is.
- Right in here.
- Cozy.
Thought you'd appreciate it.
And in a way it fits.
We are hunting big game.
Dangerous game.
You know Mrs. Chung?
By reputation.
It's a pleasure.
How do you do?
The best crypt analyst alive.
Oh, Peter, stop it!
He's a politician.
I solve puzzles.
And, uh, I understand you have brought us one today.
Yes, Ma'am.
Should I be here, sir?
Oh yes, we're all staying right here until Mrs. Chung decodes the microfilm.
Thank you.
This computer is fully programmed for our system, MacGyver.
Well, that's fine with me.
I just came for lunch.
I have not activated it!
What in hell is this?
A joke, Peter.
Trick or treat.
It's April Fool's.
Peter!
Peter!
Don't touch that door!
Hello, MacGyver.
Long time no see.
Make the lady comfortable and don't worry about her, MacGyver.
She's not dead, only sedated.
He knows you.
Who is he?
Use the name Quayle.
Sold the British out to the Russians.
Double-crossed the Russians for the Ayatollah.
Ah ha ha, those dear fun days.
I ran into him movin' a planeload of stolen military computers.
What happened?
Uh, I stole the plane back.
Your people weren't too happy with you, huh, Quayle?
No, they punished me... because of you.
But now, this is my game, my board, my rules.
Security leak a little bigger than you thought?
As big as a house.
- For this?
- No, no, no.
No, I was commissioned to destroy it and deal with you.
No!
Frightened, Karen?
All in a day's work.
And in your case, with great pleasure, MacGyver.
Peter Thornton here.
Don't be stupid!
But do be adventurous!
Try to escape.
Try to find me!
Please!
Don't touch anything, Peter.
- What do you mean?
- Ah, he's got the whole place rigged.
- To kill us?
- Yeah.
Sooner or later.
- First the man wants to have some fun.
- MacGyver, that's crazy!
- So is Quayle.
- His gears don't mesh.
Let's see if we can get outta here.
Maybe he's missed a trick or two.
I don't wanna leave Mrs. Chung back there very long.
The best thing we can do for her is to get to Karen's car and get some help.
No!
Where's my car?
Damn!
It's gone!
- Well, that's scary stuff.
- The door has got to be booby-trapped.
Yeah.
Let's see if we can figure out how.
It's not electrified.
- I don't believe it.
- I don't either.
- Gonna run a test, huh?
- Yeah.
A hit, MacGyver!
A palpable hit!
You always did like to talk, didn't ya, Quayle?
Karen, give me that sheet.
It's an incredible weakness of yours.
Kitchen.
Always had to say how great you were, didn't ya, Quayle?
- Afraid maybe people wouldn't notice.
- You'll be the last one to die.
That's what I figure, too.
Of old age, hopefully.
- Well, here it is.
- Why here?
You can find lots of handy stuff in the kitchen.
Let's look around.
Still with us, big guy?
You certainly are talented, Quayle.
- I mean, this guy has got it!
- Got us, you mean!
Like pigeons in a coop.
Like rats in a trap.
I have never been nailed down so tight in my entire life.
Your appreciation is not wasted, MacGyver.
Quayle...
Take your bows, gent.
It's not every day I run into pure perfection.
Let's just say you were my perfect challenge.
Yeah, you certainly have met that challenge.
He is definitely back at the top of his form.
A new chess game with a new master, MacGyver.
You got that straight.
Brilliance, Quayle.
Pure brilliance.
Compliment acknowledged, but you aren't going to give up so easily, are you?
What's that fidgeting you're up to?
Messing around with pots and pans won't help you.
So why don't you just put away the tinker toys...
- ... and play the game?
- Absolutely.
Positively.
Let the games begin.
Quayle was listening on a radio frequency, so I figured by using every electronic gadget around,
I could heterodyne his frequency and give the man an earful of static.
- MacGyver!
- You built an electronic jammer!
Yep!
Quayle's gonna get nothin' but white noise.
So we got a little privacy in here.
All right, I figure if we split up and keep movin' around this house, I can find a way to bust out while he's not lookin'.
- Keep him busy tracking the three of us?
- My radiophone!
It's in the library in my case.
- If I can get to it without Quayle watching.
- Nice touch.
Okay, here we go.
One at a time.
Keep him guessing.
Stay low, move fast, think smart, and...
- ... if you go, take company along.
- Get outta here!
Deputy Chief Peter Thornton.
Red.
Red.
Repeat, red.
Red.
Details...
But I already know the details, Peter.
Now I guess it's my turn to go out and distract Quayle.
Hey... it's gonna be all right.
We're gonna make it.
Heh, thanks, I needed that.
Come on, let's get outta here.
Whatta you say?
Quayle was a thorough kind of guy, so it figured he had all the windows and doors either booby-trapped or covered by the guns outside.
But maybe I could make myself a set of wheels that'd draw his fire... get me outta this homemade prison.
I'm listening to your symphony, MacGyver.

He's got a lot of security and weapons.
All right.
Maybe it's time for him to come out and play.
Hey!
I've got an idea.
Let's make an early warning system.
It'll let us know when Quayle's on the way.
And what makes you so sure Quayle's gonna leave his control room?
It's the only way to get to the power room.
Right?
Well, if we can cut off his electricity, he's bound to come lookin' for us.
Easy.
What're you gonna do?
Invite the man to a party.
- Rusted junk machinery...
I don't get it.
- Line it up, Karen.
Sorta casual clutter.
What're you doing?
Those wires look like spaghetti.
Well, I traced all the heavy wiring into Quayle's fortress.
- So?
- I'm gonna punch his lights out.
Keep stacking' that junk.
When Quayle comes in here, he's gotta walk forward only one way.
Oh, how's this?
Perfect.
Primrose path.
Pull that cabinet over, too, will ya?
You know, I sure could use a mirror.
Think you could find me one?
Yeah, just what I want to do is look in a mirror right now.
Okay, okay, I'll go find a mirror.
- That's perfect.
That's just what we need.
- So now we've got a mirror.
Yeah, sort of.
Come here.
Stand right here.
Don't move.
Oh, I see.
So you're making a periscope so we can see Quayle, right?
Yeah, that's right.
Without being seen.
- Why?
- Because he'd probably blow us away.
Where are you?
You can't escape.
I'll find you.
I'll find you.
And we've got a mirror.
And a kind of water cannon.
I don't wanna lose pressure.
The problem we're gonna have, though, is gettin' him in and standing right there.
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Where are they?
Nothing!
Nothing!
Why aren't I finding them?
We'll keep the lights on in here and in the corridor.
And so... this must be his power.
Power failure.
Auxiliary generator.
Your handy work, I suppose, MacGyver.
Damn it!
You're right, MacGyver.
No more games.
MacGyver...
That was just in case.
Nice thought.
Out in clear sight now.
Quayle!
Thank God you found us!
MacGyver was setting a trap.
- I thought I could trust you.
- We're on the same side, huh, Quayle?
I'm a geometric rarity, my dear.
There's only one side.
Myself.
Gosh, Quayle, and all this time I thought you were just scum.
This one's free of charge.
- You took a big chance trusting me.
- That's what it's all about.
All right, let's wrap him up and see how the rest are doin', all right?
Okay.
Yes, I think we've plugged the leak.
Quayle.
That's right.
I'm sorry.
Now where were we?
Oh yes, solving a puzzle.
That's okay, Mrs. Chung.
I think we just took care of that.

There are some places in this world that are a lot easier to get into than out of... like East Berlin, for instance.
I mean, look at me.
I'm dying to leave.
So far, so good.
But the next part's where it could get a little touchy.
My grief-stricken mourners here to lend a helping hand.
Getting a little warm in here.
Jawohl.
Jawohl!
Jawohl!
Uh-oh.
Sounds of trouble.
I guess this makes me about the first guy who ever attended his own funeral and lived to tell about it.
We have reviewed your proposal.
Yes, sir.
It is correct in every detail.
We have had assurances like this from you in the past, Quayle, particularly where they concern MacGyver.
MacGyver is the only blemish on my records, gentlemen.
I have never failed you in anything except...
We know that dreary story, Quayle.
He made a fool of you.
Of us.
He was lucky.
Extremely lucky.
And I admit I underestimated him.
But this time, I'm ready for him.
I can guarantee you success.
You guarantee to neutralize the information he took from us in East Berlin?
Absolutely.
Promises, always promises.
We must have results.
We must prevent that information from reaching American intelligence.
Consider it done.
And suppose you fail again?
I won't.
I see you remember what happened to you after your last failure.
Yes, sir.
I remember.
Then let that memory be an inspiration, Quayle.
Let it guide you in your efforts.
What he means, Quayle, is this is your chance for redemption.
And it is definitely your last chance.
I understand.
Thank you, sir.
Good.
It is the decision of this tribunal to authorize your operation... based on your personal guarantee.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you!
You won't regret it.
I appreciate the opportunity to redeem myself in your eyes, to reestablish my value in the cause...
Better get started, Quayle.
Our sources have traced MacGyver halfway around the world.
He's about to return home.
I'll be waiting.
Baby!
You look terrific!
Boy, is it good to see you!
What a sight!
Especially with the three heavies that are setting you up for a hit.
Peter Thornton sent me.
How's the General?
Generally good, except Thornton is a colonel.
And he asked me to remind you that he owes you a camel.
And you've came all the way down here just to tell me that?
Oh, sweet Lulubelle.
I love this girl!
I love her!
She's great!
I love, I love her!
You'd love her, too.
Let's go, Lulubelle.
Name's Karen Blake.
Look more like a Lulubelle to me.
So, how's Peter?
Waiting for you.
So, hold on, lover.
Aren't we going to Pete's office?
No, he set up a special safe house.
You been with the Company long?
Why?
Well, I thought I knew all the pretty girls in the office.
Business must be good.
Since when do safe houses look like this?
Look, I was just told to bring you here for a high-level debriefing.
High level lives in high places.
I've just got one question.
Hey, I'm only a courier.
I'm only hungry.
When do we eat?
Good to see you again...
MacGyver.
Quaint.
We thought so.
Pete!
All right!
Good to see you!
And I thought all secret agents were cold and heartless.
No, Pete and I go way back to some pretty funny places.
Is that what the camel was about?
Well, the first time I met this fella, he pulled me out of the quicksand in the Wadi Nefud.
Deep desert.
Then he put me on a camel, and he gave it this gigantic swat.
Ha!
What happened?
Oh, we just rode on out.
Yeah, for six days.
I couldn't sit easy for a week.
Anyway, it's good to see you.
And congratulations.
You had some problems getting out of East Berlin.
Uh, yeah.
Had some real unfriendlies waitin' for me.
I sort of had to cut and run for the border.
Turned a coffin into a jet ski.
Yeah, that part was fun.
I had a real good time.
Me and, uh, junior here.
That is very important, so, thanks.
You're welcome.
And congratulations yourself.
I heard.
Deputy Chief of the Department.
Big deal.
You can call me sir.
Yeah, I noticed.
This place?
Yeah, it's been out of use for quite a while.
Off the list and unofficial, which is exactly what we need.
It seems we have a very large hole in departmental security.
Oh?
What leaked?
Your name.
And what you brought back.
Terrific.
So, I'm handling it personally from here on.
Here, now, and quietly.
My own office doesn't even know we're here.
No one does.
It's perfect.
Yes, it is.
Right in here.
Cozy.
Thought you'd appreciate it.
And in a way, it fits.
We are hunting big game.
Dangerous game.
You know Mrs. Chung?
By reputation.
It's a pleasure.
How do you do?
The best crypt analyst alive.
Oh, Peter, stop it!
He's a politician.
I solve puzzles.
And, uh, I understand you have brought us one today.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Should I be here, sir?
Oh yes.
We're all staying right here until Mrs. Chung decodes the microfilm.
Thank you.
This computer is fully programmed for us, Mr. MacGyver.
Well, that's fine with me.
I just came for lunch.
I have not activated it!
What in hell is this?
Ajoke, Peter.
Trick or treat.
It's April Fool's.
Peter!
Peter!
Oh!
Don't touch that door!
Aah!
Hello, MacGyver.
Long time no see.
Make the lady comfortable and don't worry about her, MacGyver.
She's not dead, only sedated.
He knows you.
Who is he?
Used the name Quayle.
Sold the British out to the Russians.
Double-crossed the Russians for the Ayatollah.
Those dear fun days.
I ran into him movin' a planeload of stolen military computers.
What happened?
Uh, I stole the plane back.
Your people weren't too happy with you, huh, Quayle?
No, they punished me because of you.
But now, this is my game, my board, my rules.
Security leak a little bigger than you thought?
As big as a house.
For this?
No, no, no, no.
No!
I was commissioned to destroy it and deal with you.
No!
Frightened, Karen?
All in a day's work.
And in your case, with great pleasure, MacGyver.
Peter Thornton here.
Don't be stupid!
But do be adventurous!
Try to escape.
Try to find me, please!
Don't touch anything, Peter.
What do you mean?
Ah, he's got the whole place rigged.
To kill us?
Yep, sooner or later.
But first the man wants to have some fun.
MacGyver, that's crazy!
So is Quayle.
His gears don't mesh.
Let's see if we can get out of here.
Maybe he's missed a trick or two.
I don't want to leave Mrs. Chung back there very long.
Well, the best thing we can do for her is to get to Karen's car and get some help.
Oh, no.
Where's my car?
Damn!
It's gone!
Well, that's scary stuff.
The door has got to be booby-trapped.
Yeah.
Let's see if we can figure out how.
It's not electrified.
I don't believe it.
I don't, either.
Gonna run a test, huh?
Yeah.
A hit, MacGyver!
A palpable hit!
You always did like to talk, didn't you, Quayle?
Karen, give me that sheet.
It's kind of a weakness of yours.
Kitchen.
Always had to say how great you were, didn't you, Quayle?
Afraid maybe people wouldn't notice.
You'll be the last one to die.
That's what I figure, too.
Of old age, hopefully.
Well, here it is.
Why here?
You can find lots of handy stuff in the kitchen.
Let's look around.
Still with us, big guy?
You certainly are talented, Quayle.
I mean, this guy has got it.
Got us, you mean.
Like pigeons in a coop.
Like rats in a trap.
I have never been nailed down so tight in my entire life.
Your appreciation is not wasted, MacGyver.
Quayle, take your bows, gent.
It's not every day I run into pure perfection.
Let's just say you are my perfect challenge.
Yeah, you certainly have met that challenge.
He is definitely back at the top of his form.
A new chess game with a new master, MacGyver.
You got that straight.
Brilliance, Quayle.
Pure brilliance.
Compliments acknowledged, but you aren't going to give up so easily, are you?
What's that fidgeting you're up to?
Messing around with pots and pans won't help you.
So why don't you just put away the tinker toys and play the game?
Absolutely.
Positively.
Let the games begin.
Quayle was listening on a radio frequency, so I figured by using every electronic gadget around,
I could heterodyne his frequency, give the man an earful of static.
MacGyver.
You built an electronic jammer.
Yup.
Quayle's gonna get nothin' but white noise.
So we got a little privacy in here.
All right,
I figure if we split up and keep movin' around this house,
I can find a way to bust out while he's not lookin'.
Keep him busy tracking the three of us?
My radiophone... it's in the library in my case.
If I can get to it without Quayle watching...
Nice touch.
Okay, here we go.
One at a time.
Keep him guessing.
Stay low, move fast, think smart.
And if you go, And if you go, take company along.
Get out of here.
You know, MacGyver, when I was little,
I used to play international spy.
I think we all did, didn't we?
Oh, I'd be wearing a designer gown and going to some great party at Buckingham Palace, meeting a Russian ambassador.
And I would get him to tell me all his secrets.
Maybe that's why
I went to work for the Department.
Deputy Chief Peter Thornton.
Red.
Red.
Repeat, red, red.
Details...
But I already know the details, Peter.
Now I guess it's my turn to go out and distract Quayle.
Hey... it's gonna be all right.
We're gonna make it.
Thanks, I needed that.
Come on, let's get out of here.
What do you say?
Quayle was a thorough kind of guy, so it figured he had all the windows and doors either booby-trapped or covered by the guns outside.
But maybe I could make myself a set of wheels that'd draw his fire and get me out of this homemade prison.
I'm listening to your symphony, MacGyver.
Or is it a requiem?
When I was a kid,
I used to build model planes with rubber band motors.
Then I discovered batteries.
It sure did increase the mileage.
Ah, my dear Karen.
Welcome to my fortress.
It's going rather well, don't you think?
Well, Quayle, I-I really didn't expect all this to be happening.
I mean, you said this was going to be over quickly.
Well, it will be.
But you mustn't deny me my brief moment of fun.
"Fun"?
I'm shaking!
Are you afraid they might find you out?
Who could suspect such a darling innocent?
But this MacGyver is -is very smart.
And Thornton is no dummy either.
Yes, that's what makes you my, um, what shall I call you?
My little mole.
No, that's far too unflattering.
My perfect collaborator in this... delicious charade.
I'm telling you, Quayle, I'm scared-- of them and of you.
You said that we were just going to do a simple job without hurt.
I'm just teasing.
Just toying with them.
But Mrs. Chung is down...
She's a stranger.
There's someone much closer to you that you ought to be worried about, isn't there?
All right.
I'll do what you say, but...
Perfect.
Now, what is MacGyver doing in the kitchen?
When I left him, he was taking the motor out of a blender.
Ah, yes, that's the handyman side of MacGyver.
He likes to make clever little things out of odd bits.
But I must have more details.
I must know exactly what he is doing!
I'll go see.
Yes, you do that, my dear.
No time to waste.
The sooner we deal with MacGyver, the sooner this'll be over.
There's my perfect collaborator.
Stay in touch.
What sort of a fantasy is MacGyver indulging?
Answer me, Karen.
Are you there?
Yes.
He's at the, uh, rear kitchen door, and he's built some kind of wheeled cart with a piece of the suit of armor on top.
It's the position I care about.
He'll be coming out of the back door... and I'll be waiting for him.
Very good, Karen.
What are you going to do?
My dear... sweet Karen,
I only intend to embarrass them painfully... even MacGyver.
Especially MacGyver.
Help.
Obviously the guns are targeted to shoot at a given height, at anything that moves.
But they can't shoot in two directions at once, so if I can get them aiming down there...
Quayle?
I think he's gotten clear.
Not to worry.
I'll get him back, Karen.
MacGyver, come back!
I've got Thornton!
If you want to see Thornton alive, now is the time.
He's waiting for you in the trophy room.
I've turned my guns off so you can come back.
The game is not over... yet.
He's coming back to us, Karen.
But did I detect a note of concern for MacGyver?
We can't afford a major incident like a multiple-V.I.P. murder.
Look, my orders are to retrieve a piece of intelligence, not to carry out your damned blood feud.
I give the orders, my girl.
And I'm ordering you to the trophy room.
You can get the roll of film from Thornton there.
Now, get going before MacGyver gets there!
Thornton's not going to give it to me.
He won't object.
I've given him the shock of his life.
Now, go on, girl!
Right.
He's dead.
Electrocuted.
He's not dead.
Oh, my God.
I thought...
She's still the same.
They'll both be all right if we get them help in time.
Yeah.
MacGyver,
I know you would have gotten away.
It's all right.
I changed my mind, anyway.
If I get away, Quayle gets away.
And I want him.
Let's go somewhere where we can't be seen or heard.
Quayle's got the house rigged electronically through the main power line which is probably in the basement.
I saw some vinegar here.
Yeah.
Now, if we can cut or control that power line,
Quayle goes deaf, dumb and blind.
He loses his edge.
MacGyver, what the hell are we doing?
Making some preparations.
MacGyver!
Thank you.
Now, you want to tell me if Quayle hired you locally, or were you assigned to him?
It was an assignment.
How did you know?
Well, first of all, you were a little too quick and cool getting me out of that hit.
And the hit men didn't even try to follow.
Secondly, you took one look at Pete from across the room, and assessed that he had been electrocuted.
You're very quick, MacGyver.
Not quick enough to save Pete from a pretty good jolt.
You could have killed him, you know.
I was told no killing.
Only that we would...
get the film back.
Why draw the line at murder?
Quayle doesn't.
I didn't know that.
I've never worked with him before.
I told you, they assigned me.
For how much?
How much money they giving you to betray your country, huh?
Money?
It's not...
I wouldn't do it for money!
Look, I have never done anything like this before.
Oh, please, don't tell me you're one of those political mal...
They've got my brother!
He works for Mr. Thornton, too.
For the Company.
But he was on assignment in Czechoslovakia, and he got caught.
And they said they would kill him unless...
Unless you cooperated.
Worked for them.
There's another way, Karen.
You don't have to give in to their blackmail.
But my brother-- he's my only family.
Help me catch Quayle.
We'll use him as a bargaining chip.
Trade Quayle for your brother.
What if they won't?
Then I'll go in and get him...
personally.
You would do that for me after... everything?
Will you help me?
What do you want me to do?
Well, I think we should start by forcing Quayle out of his electronic fortress.
How?
By unplugging all his gadgets.
We've got to get to the power room in the basement.
Let's go.
He could be anywhere.
Or everywhere.
You thought I couldn't track you, MacGyver.
Well, we all make mistakes.
This one is, I'm afraid, fatal.
Quayle!
Good-bye, Karen.
I'll try to arrange a posthumous medal.
Watch the moving dot.
Whatever it touches, it kills.
Damn!
Closer and closer.
I could hit you at any time.
These are your last moments.
So, enjoy them.
My daddy used to say you can't hit what you can't see.
A smokescreen.
That won't save you.
Now we're invisible.
Okay.
Follow me.
Come on.
The back stairs, where Quayle can't see or hear us.
Damn it!
MacGyver!
Karen!
There really is no escape.
MacGyver,
I know where Quayle is.
He's down that corridor to the right.
His control room is down at the end.
The door is steel.
He's got a lot of security and weapons.
All right.
Maybe it's time for him to come out and play.
Hey...
I've got an idea.
Let's make an early warning system.
It'll let us know when Quayle's on the way.

Uh-huh.
Well, if we can cut off his electricity, he's bound to come looking for us.
Easy.
What are you gonna do?
Invite the man to a party.
Rusted junk machinery...
I don't get it.
Line it up, Karen.
Sort of casual clutter.
What are you doing?
Those wires look like spaghetti.
Well, I traced all the heavy wiring into Quayle's fortress.
So?
I'm gonna punch his lights out.
Keep stacking that junk.
When Quayle comes in here, he's gotta walk forward only one way.
How's this?
Perfect.
Primrose path.

Kannst du bitte helfen?

Jawohl.

Off the list and unofficial, which is exactly what we need.
It seems we have a very large hole in departmental security.
- What leaked?
- Your name.
- And what you brought back.
- Terrific.
So I'm handling it personally from here on.
Here, now and quietly.
My own office doesn't even know we're here.
No one does.
It's perfect.
Yes, it is.
Right in here.
- Cosy.
- Thought you'd appreciate it.
And in a way, it fits.
We are hunting big game.
Dangerous game.
- You know Mrs Chung?
- By reputation.
- It's a pleasure.
- How do you do?
The best crypt analyst alive.
Oh, Peter, stop it.
He's a politician.
I solve puzzles.
And I understand you have brought us one today.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
- Should I be here, sir?
- Oh, yes, we're all staying right here until Mrs Chung decodes the microfilm.
Thank you.
This computer is fully programmed for us, Mr MacGyver.
Well, that's fine with me.
I just came for lunch.
I have not activated it.
What in hell is this?
A joke, Peter.
Trick or treat.
It's April Fools'.
Peter!
Peter!
Don't touch that door!
Hello, MacGyver.
Long time, no see.
Make the lady comfortable, and don't worry about her, MacGyver.
She's not dead, only sedated.
He knows you.
Who is he?
Used the name Quayle.
Sold the British out to the Russians.
Double-crossed the Russians for the ayatollah.
Those dear, fun days.
I ran into him moving a planeload of stolen military computers.
- What happened?
- I stole the plane back.
Your people weren't too happy with you, huh, Quayle?
No, they punished me.
Because of you.
But now this is my game, my board, my rules.
Security leak a little bigger than you thought?
As big as a house.
- For this?
- No, no, no, no.
I was commissioned to destroy it and deal with you.
- No.
- Frightened, Karen?
All in a day's work.
And in your case, with great pleasure, MacGyver.
Peter Thornton here.
Don't be stupid.
But do be adventurous.
Try to escape.
Try to find me.
Please!
Don't touch anything, Peter.
What do you mean?
He's got the whole place rigged.
- To kill us?
- Yeah.
Sooner or later.
But first, the man wants to have some fun.
- MacGyver, that's crazy.
- So is Quayle.
His gears don't mesh.
Let's see if we can get out of here.
Maybe he's missed a trick or two.
I don't wanna leave Mrs Chung back there very long.
The best thing we can do for her is to get to Karen's car and get some help.
Oh, no.
Where's my car?
Damn!
It's gone.
Well, that's scary stuff.
The door has got to be booby-trapped.
Yeah.
Let's see if we can figure out how.
It's not electrified.
- I don't believe it.
- I don't either.
- Gonna run a test, huh?
- Yeah.
A hit, MacGyver.
A palpable hit.
You always did like to talk, didn't you, Quayle?
Karen, give me that sheet.
It's kind of a weakness of yours.
Kitchen.
Always had to say how great you were, didn't you, Quayle?
Afraid maybe people wouldn't notice.
You'll be the last one to die.
That's what I figure too.
Of old age, hopefully.
- Well, here it is.
- Why here?
You can find lots of handy stuff in a kitchen.
Let's look around.
Still with us, big guy?
You certainly are talented, Quayle.
- I mean, this guy has got it.
- Got us, you mean.
Like pigeons in a coop.
Like rats in a trap.
I have never been nailed down so tight in my entire life.
Your appreciation is not wasted, MacGyver.
Quayle, take your bows, gent.
It's not every day I run into pure perfection.
Let's just say you are my perfect challenge.
Well, you certainly have met that challenge.
He is definitely back at the top of his form.
A new chess game with a new master, MacGyver.
You got that straight.
Brilliance, Quayle.
Pure brilliance.
Compliments acknowledged, but you aren't gonna give up so easily, are you?
What's that fidgeting you're up to?
Messing around with pots and pans won't help you.
So why don't you just put away the Tinkertoys and play the game?
Absolutely.
Positively.
Let the games begin.
Quayle was listening on a radio frequency, so I figured by using every electronic gadget around,
I could heterodyne his frequency, give the man an earful of static.
MacGyver.
- You built an electronic jammer.
- Yep.
Quayle's gonna get nothing but white noise.
So we got a little privacy in here.
All right, I figure if we split up and keep moving around this house,
I can find a way to bust out while he's not looking.
Keep him busy tracking the three of us.
My radio phone.
It's in the library in my case.
If I can get to it without Quayle watching...
- Nice touch.
- Okay, here we go.
One at a time.
Keep him guessing.
Stay low, move fast, think smart,
- and if you go...
- And if you go, take company along.
Get out of here.
You know, MacGyver, when I was little,
I used to play international spy.
I think we all did, didn't we?
Oh, I'd be wearing a designer gown and going to some great party at Buckingham Palace, meeting a Russian ambassador.
And I would get him to tell me all his secrets.
Maybe that's why I went to work for the department.
Deputy Chief Peter Thornton.
Red, red.
Repeat.
Red, red.
Details...
But I already know the details, peter.
Well, I guess it's my turn to go out and distract Quayle.
Hey.
It's gonna be all right.
We're gonna make it.
- Thanks, I needed that.
- Come on, let's get out of here.
What do you say?
Quayle was a thorough kind of guy, so it figured he had all the windows and doors either booby-trapped or covered by the guns outside.
But maybe I could make myself a set of wheels that'd draw his fire, and get me out of this homemade prison.
I'm listening to your symphony, MacGyver.
Or is it a requiem?
When I was a kid, I used to build model planes with rubber-band motors.
Then I discovered batteries.
It sure did increase the mileage.
My dear Karen.
Welcome to my fortress.
It's going rather well, don't you think?
Well, Quayle, I really didn't expect all this to be happening.
I mean, you said this was gonna be over quickly.
Well, it will be.
But you mustn't deny me my brief moment of fun.
Fun?
I'm shaking.
Are you afraid they might find you out?
Who could suspect such a darling innocent?
But this MacGyver is very smart.
And Thornton is no dummy either.
Yes, that's what makes you my...
What shall I call you?
My little mole.
No, that's far too unflattering.
My perfect collaborator in this delicious charade.
I'm telling you, Quayle, I'm scared.
Of them and of you.
You said that we were just gonna do a simple job without hurt...
I'm just teasing.
Just toying with them.
- But Mrs Chung is down...
- She's a stranger.
There's someone much closer to you that you ought to be worried about, isn't there?
All right.
I'll do what you say.
Perfect.
Now, what is MacGyver doing in the kitchen?
When I left him, he was taking the motor out of a blender.
Yes, that's the handyman side of MacGyver.
He likes to make clever little things out of odd bits.
But I must have more details.
I must know exactly what he is doing.
- I'll go see.
- Yes, you do that, my dear.
No time to waste.
The sooner we deal with MacGyver, the sooner this'll be over.
There's my perfect collaborator.
Stay in touch.
What sort of a fantasy is MacGyver indulging?
Answer me, Karen.
Are you there?
Yes.
He's at the rear kitchen door, and he's built some kind of wheeled cart with a piece of the suit of armour on top.
It's the position I care about.
He'll be coming out of the back door.
And I'll be waiting for him.
Very good, Karen.
- What are you gonna do?
- My dear, sweet Karen I only intend to embarrass them painfully.
Even MacGyver.
Especially MacGyver.
Help.
Obviously, the guns are targeted to shoot at a given height, at anything that moves.
But they can't shoot in two directions at once, so if I can get them aiming down there...
Quayle, well, he's gotten clear.
Not to worry.
I'll get him back, Karen.
MacGyver, come back!
I've got Thornton.
If you want to see Thornton alive, now is the time.
He's waiting for you in the trophy room.
I've turned my guns off so you can come back.
The game is not over yet.
He's coming back to us, Karen.
But did I detect a note of concern for MacGyver?
We can't afford a major incident like a multiple VIP murder.
Look, my orders are to retrieve a piece of intelligence, not to carry out your damned blood feud.
I give the orders, my girl.
And I'm ordering you to the trophy room.
You can get the roll of film from Thornton there.
Now get going, before MacGyver gets there.
But Thornton's not gonna give it to me.
He won't object.
I've given him the shock of his life.
Now go on, girl.
Right.
He's dead.
Electrocuted.
He's not dead.
Oh, my God.
I thought...
She's still the same.
They'll both be all right if we get them help in time.
Yeah.
MacGyver, I know you would've gotten away.
It's all right.
I changed my mind anyway.
If I get away, Quayle gets away.
And I want him.
Let's go somewhere where we can't be seen or heard.
Quayle's got the house rigged electronically from the main power line, which is probably in the basement.
I saw some vinegar here.
Yeah.
Now, if we can cut or control that power line,
Quayle goes deaf, dumb and blind.
He loses his edge.
MacGyver, what the hell are we doing?
Making some preparations.
MacGyver!
Thank you.
Now, you wanna tell me if Quayle hired you locally, or were you assigned to him?
It was an assignment.
- How did you know?
- Well, first of all, you were a little too quick and cool getting me out of that hit, and the hit men didn't even try to follow.
Secondly, you took one look at Pete from across the room and assessed that he had been electrocuted.
You're very quick, MacGyver.
Not quick enough to save Pete from a pretty good jolt.
You could have killed him, you know.
I was told no killing.
Only that we would get the film back.
Why draw the line at murder?
Quayle doesn't.
I didn't know that.
I've never worked with him before.
- I told you, they assigned me.
- For how much?
How much money they giving you to betray your country, huh?
Money?
It's not...
I wouldn't do it for money.
Look, I have never done anything like this before.
Oh, please.
Don't tell me you're one of those political...
They've got my brother!
He works for Mr Thornton too.
For the company.
But he was on an assignment in Czechoslovakia and he got caught.
And they said they would kill him.
- Unless...
- Unless you cooperated.
Worked for them.
There's another way, Karen.
You don't have to give in to their blackmail.
- But my brother, he's my only family.
- Help me catch Quayle.
We'll use him as a bargaining chip.
Trade Quayle for your brother.
What if they won't?
Then I'll go in and get him.
Personally.
You would do that for me after everything?
Will you help me?
What do you want me to do?
Well, I think we should start by forcing Quayle out of his electronic fortress.
- How?
- By unplugging all his gadgets.
We gotta get to the power room in the basement.
Let's go.
He could be anywhere.
Or everywhere.
You thought I couldn't track you, MacGyver.
Well, we all make mistakes.
This one is, I'm afraid, fatal.
- Quayle.
- Goodbye, Karen.
I'll try to arrange a posthumous medal.
Watch the moving dot.
Whatever it touches, it kills.
- Damn!
- Closer and closer.
I could hit you at any time.
These are your last moments.
So enjoy them.
My daddy used to say, "You can't hit what you can't see."
A smoke screen.
That won't save you.
Now we're invisible.
Okay, follow me.
Come on.
The back stairs where Quayle can't see or hear us.
Damn!
MacGyver!
Karen!
There really is no escape.
MacGyver, I know where Quayle is.
He's down that corridor to the right.
His control room is down at the end.
The door is steel.
He's got a lot of security and weapons.
All right.
Maybe it's time for him to come out and play.
Hey.
I got an idea.
Let's make an early-warning system.
It'll let us know when Quayle's on the way.
And what makes you so sure Quayle's gonna leave his control room?
It's the only way to get to the power room, right?
Well, if we can cut off his electricity, he's bound to come looking for us.
Easy.
What are you gonna do?
Invite the man to a party.
Rusted junk, machinery?
I don't get it.
Line it up, Karen.
Sort of casual clutter.
What are you doing?
Those wires look like spaghetti.
Well, I traced all the heavy wiring into Quayle's fortress.
- So?
- I'm gonna punch his lights out.
Keep stacking that junk.
If Quayle comes in here, he's gotta walk forward only one way.
How's this?
Perfect.
Primrose path.
Pull that cabinet over too, will you?
You know, I sure could use a mirror.
Think you could find me one?
Yeah, just what I wanna do is look in a mirror right now.
Okay, okay, I'll go find a mirror.
That's perfect.
That's just what we need.
- So now we've got a mirror.
- Yeah, sort of.
Come here.
Stand right here.
Don't move.
Oh, I see.
So you're making a periscope so we can see Quayle, right?
Yeah, that's right.
Without being seen.
Why?
Because he'd probably blow us away.
Where are you?
You can't escape.
I'll find you.
I'll find you.
And we've got a mirror.
And a kind of water cannon.
I don't wanna lose pressure.
The problem we're gonna have, though, is getting him in and standing right there.
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Where are they?
Nothing.
Nothing!
Why aren't I finding them?
We'll keep the lights on in here and in the corridor.
So this must be his power.
Power failure?
Auxiliary generator.
Your handiwork, I suppose, MacGyver.
Damn!
Right, MacGyver.
No more games.
MacGyver...
That was just in case.
Nice thought.
Out in clear sight now.
Quayle!
Thank God you found us.
MacGyver was setting a trap.
I thought I could trust you.
We're on the same side, right, Quayle?
I'm a geometric rarity, my dear.
There's only one side.
Myself.
Gosh, Quayle, and all this time I thought you were just scum.
This one's free of charge.
You took a big chance trusting me.
That's what it's all about.
All right, let's wrap him up and see how the rest are doing, all right?
Okay.
Yes, I think we've plugged the leak.
Quayle.
That's right.
I'm sorry.
Now, where were we?
Oh, yes.
Solving a puzzle.
That's okay, Mrs Chung.
I think we just took care of that.
Put those things away.
- Why?
No binoculars at Christmas breakfast.
Put them away!
Give them here!
Come along boys, no bickering.
- I'm not bickering.
No, I'm bickering!
- Set a good example for once.
Let your son set a good example for once.
Is he only my son all of a sudden?
- Aren't I your son?
You don't take after me, at any rate.
Victor, how can you say that?
Your eyes, your hair-lines, your walks...
That's not what I mean.
He means that I haven't got a single good quality; and he has.
Is that what you mean?
- Yes, that's what I mean.
With those good qualities he became an admysterytator.
Administrator, and I'm not an administrator.
Your fasther is sub-manager.
Oh, I thought he was an admysterytator.
- Administrator!
Are you sure about that?
I still think it's...
Administrator!
We haven't wished each other Merry Christmas yet.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
And let's for once try to have Christmas breakfast without any arguments.
- But there aren't any arguments.
No, I'm just wishing us a Merry Christmas breakfast without arguments.
Then there will be an argument.
Why must you bloody-well reverse everything?
I'm putting things straight.
Straight to you, imbicile!
Stop it.
Now there is an argument.
Because you accentuated it.
Is that so surprising?
Every Christmas breakfast I can remember has been permeated with discord.
Because up till now you've said at the beginning of every Christmas breakfast with that Christmas-breakfast look in your eyes:
"Let's for once try to have a Christmas breakfast without any arguments."
And every year you manage with those nasty wolfish eyes of yours to completely poison the atmosphere.
Hey, did you hear that?
He's just asking for an argument.
You mustn't try and push things to extremes, Victor.
I say, the salmon is delicious.
Isn't it?
Shrimps the whole time.
I thought let's have salmon.
I've never been a one for shrimps.
He always wants shrimps.
What?
I don't even like shrimps, you're the one who always wants shrimps.
Dove, who is it that always wants shrimps?
Dove?
Your father is right.
So I'm lying?
I'm not saying that.
But you did always want shrimps.
So I'm lying then!
Say I'm lying.
You're lying.
Now, that's heartenings I must say.
Your own mother calling you a liar.
You're ganging up together, I knew it, against me.
Why do I still live here?
Because you're an imbicile who doesn't dare to go outside.
We want to have a serious talk with you.
Your father's got a plan.
You'll soon be thirty one.
- Thirty two.
Tomorrow we're going to the dunes.
- A quiet, secluded spot.
You mustn't think anything more of it, we're just going out.
Fresh air's good for you.
We're going in the car, we won't see another soul.
And what about those gin-traps?
I'll walk on ahead and beat the ground with a stick.
Yeah, and then of course we'll get lost.
I know exactly what will happen.
We won't get lost, Abel.
Your father's taking a compass.
Your mother's making a bag full of food.
Nothing can happen to us.
What about stray bullets?
There are hunters in the dunes, you know.
How often hav you read that:
"Man hit by stray bullet."?
There's no hunting in the dunes, is there?
Of course not, just a few rabbit-snares, that's all.
Right, and who sets them?
Poachers, that's who.
They're all inbred.
They go stark raving mad if anyone ventures onto their hunting-grounds.
D'you know what?
We'll take a guide with us.
And two bearers, and guns and ammunition and a first-aid kit, and beads.
And a mosquito-net and a sextant.
We're not going into the bloody jungle!
There's nothing wrong.
Just answer the psychiatrist's questions.
Psychiatrist?
I'm not retarded, am I?
- That's for the psychiatrist to decide.
Doctor van Boven, this is Abel.
Abel, act normally.
Doctor, don't be misled.
This is just play-acting.
What's your name, lad?
For God's sake Abel, stop that nonsense!
Doctor, you understand that he's just putting this on?
Yes, I understand.
I'm not retarded.
- No, of course not.
The question is, what is the cause?
Oh, I can tell you right away.
Please sit down.
How long is it since Abel has been outside?
Two years.
- Ten years.
And for ten years he's been trying to cut flies in half.
When Abel was born, where there any complications?
Yes.
Where do you get that idea from?
- Well, it was a long, painful delivery.
Abel was blue, he had difficulty breathing.
What are you talking about?
You were there, at the birth?
Yes, of course, yes.
Well, I was in the corridor, but I know exactly what happened.
The first few weeks he had signs of slight paralysis.
And around the age of fourteen eczema in his armpits.
According to our doctor, the result of nervousness.
Now, this is going beyond all reason!
Please, admit that none of this is true!
I don't want to draw any conclusions straight away.
But I can't help feeling that the root of the problem a major part of it anyway, lies with the father.
What?
Yes, look, you're ashamed of Abel.
Wouldn't you be ashamed of a son like that?
That's got nothing to do with it.
The other part the root of the problem, lies with the mother.
You see, you over-protect your son.
Both your attitudes as parents are in conflict and because of this, the lad finds himself in a vacuum.
Before we get round to Abel it would be advisable for you to come to a mutual agreement within your relationship.
I'll be hearing from you.
Well, that's that.
You're rushing things, sir.
I'm not used to...
Being made love to?
- Being made love to...
So brazenly.
- So brazenly.
Again!
You're rushing things, sir.
I'm not used to being...
This is such a rotten line.
That rotten line encapulates how Maggie is feeling.
Because Maggie is feeling so uncomfortable she expresses herself in a likewise way.
And that's why, in this situation, it's a good line.
And something else, when Victor tries to kiss you you've got to show much more bewilderment.
Imagine that you've never been kissed by a man before.
And Victor, over-play it, eh?
Make it difficult for Christine.
We can always water it down later.
Bewilderment, Christine.
Disgust, disgust!
What is it now?
!
- I just don't feel this, you know.
Do we have to watch this for much longer?
This is an importand moment.
We're going to carry on until it's right.
And Christine, relax!
The mere thought of a kiss repulses you.
I'm nearly thirty two, and I've still never watched television.
We don't need Victor anyway to buy a television.
Every month your father gives a fixed sum of money and at the end of the month it's all gone.
I know that.
Look at how we eat.
The whole time it's...
salmon, oysters, lobsters.
Four course meals.
And all those new clothes, new shoes.
When summer's on the way I get new clothes.
What use are they to me?
You stop buying new clothes.
We down the meals.
Within a month, we'll have a television.
THE NAKED GIRLS
No hors-d'oeuvre?
- Didn't get round to it today.
De Beer has been sacked.
- De Beer?
How often have I mentioned that name?
It must be a thousand times.
I don't know de Beer.
- A colleague.
What's this?
- A fish finger.
A fish finger?
What kind of a hideous little fish finger is this?
Tell us about de Beer.
- Yes.
He's been sacked.
- Because?
Because he was carrying on with Merkelbach's wife.
Merkelbach?
Yes, Merkelbach.
Who could be that?
- No idea.
Come now, Abel.
Your father's boss.
I say, what's going on?
Only one vegetable?
The people behind the Iron Curtain would lick their lips at the sight of a fish finger.
And those people work the whole day long.
They go into the steelfactory before it's light and don't come out until it's dark again.
If you ever see a photograph of Russians in a park, then they all have little eyes.
Enough!
What do you think of that then?
Of what?
- A secret affair like that?
Well, as long as it's a secret affair, I've nothing against it.
How old is she?
- Who?
Merkelbach's wife.
- Thirty eight or so.
Still fertile as well.
I don't understand de Beer.
If you wanted to have a secret affair then you'd choose someone infertile wouldn't you?
What if she got pregnant?
It could just as well be Merkelbach's child.
With a face like de Beer?
What kind of a face has he got then?
A bit ruddy, with eyes like a cod-fish.
Where do you get that idea?
De Beer is palid, with piggy little eyes.
Who's got the ruddy face and the cod-eyes then?
That's Prokovsky, isn't it?
- Oh, you know him then?
Yes, you've mentioned him before.
Prokovsky, didn't he have asthma?
Yes, he's been in a sanatorium for three years.
It must be great in a sanatorium lying in bed all day, television, people looking after you...
What is it?
What's for afters?
What's going on?
No hors-d'oeuvre, one fish finger, one vegetable, no afters.
I'm not a bloody proletarian!
So, this is Abel then.
You don't want to go outside?
Are you frightened of me?
Good.
Then we've already got somewhere.
What's this?
We shan't be needing those here.
So, come along.
Madame, didn't I ask you to remove all the silver from the room?
I did do.
Yes but, there is silver present.
I just can't work like this.
- But, I did remove all the silver.
Honestly!
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm not a metal detector.
Please get in touch when the room is free of silver.
Good afternoon.
Why haven't we got a television, anyway?
It would be nice for Abel as well.
I mean, what does a boy like him see?
He sees enough, more than enough.
But always the same.
On the television you see completely different things.
Programmes about termites for instance.
Relevant to him, termites.
God, they broadcast other things as well, don't they?
A television could change Abel's way of thinking.
There's going to be no television in this house.
It's nearly New Year.
Goodness, already?
Where are the fireworks?
- Strange.
I know a nice game.
We have to pretend that we don't know each other.
Yes!
Hello, sir.
I don't know you.
I don't know you either.
- My name's Abel.
What a coincidence, so's mine.
That's impossible, you're Victor.
Isn't it too confusing if you're called Abel as well?
But I think it's silly if you're called Abel as well.
Yes, it's silly.
Why not Fred, or Harry.
Right, Harry then.
I say Harry, are you married?
- Certainly.
To a very stupid woman.
I'm not stupid.
Who is that lady?
- I don't know her.
I'd like to introduce myself.
I'd rather you didn't.
I'd rather she didn't either.
- I'm playing as well, you know.
Hey, Dove.
It's only a game, isn't it?
- Yes, between the three of us!
You're playing too, aren't you?
Not if I can introduce myself.
But that's the game.
You've got to butt in.
I say, Abel, I've got two tickets for the horse-races.
Do you feel like coming?
Yes, I'd like that.
- Can I ask you something?
Did you hear something?
- No, I didn't hear a thing.
What's this?
How can I butt in then?
I just heard it again.
I heard something as well this time.
Why are you stopping?
Victor was walking on the other side of the street.
He crossed over.
And I saw him but he didn't strike.
And suddenly he was standing in front of me.
And he said: "Would you like to have a drink with me?"
I hesitated, after all he was a stranger.
Then he did something which it threw me right off guard.
- What did he do then?
He looked at me a bit severely actually and he raised his hand to my head.
It made me jump a bit.
He stroked a lock of hair out of my eyes like that... behind my ear.
That's the way to do it, very gently.
Abel doesn't even know what a negro is, just to name one thing.
Everyone knows what a negro is.
Even so, a television wouldn't do him any harm.
Television is a load of nonsense.
Strange men and women laughing at you.
They can't even see you.
"So nice to have you with us again."
Ridiculous!
I'm not there you're not either, and neither is Abel.
What about a nice film?
Now, that's an even bigger load of rubbish.
Take a cowboy film.
This cowboy, hasn't he got any parents whom he visits from time to time?
Or have those parents died?
Is this cowboy a foundling?
Has he got brothers and sisters?
Has he had an education?
Not a word about that, no.
If you're on stage you don't say to the audience:
"I'm so-and-so, I went to grammar school and I've got two brothers."
Of course not.
But it comes up in that piece.
I play an Earl, who's fallen on hard times and I say to the person playing the opposite me...
Christine, yes, that I have studied.
The detective you played last year never mentioned his education.
That was a rotten play.
First I want the kitchen painted.
You shake hands with her and introduce yourself.
Don't squeeze!
Normal.
Not like a damp sponge.
Normal, a normal handshake.
Hello, I'm Abel.
You see, there's nothing to it.
And then you say something.
- This evening, I will.
This evening, my foot!
Now!
I could say anything.
It depends on her as well.
Nothing depends on her.
It depends on you.
She's unsure of herself, you have to put her at ease.
She could be the first to say something as well?
She won't be the first!
How do you know?
- That's how it goes.
The man speaks, and the woman replies... now and then.
And then...
I say: "What's that smell?"
- That's not what you say.
It is, because then she'll say:
"That's my perfume."
And then I'll say: "Mmm, nice..."
Or: "Pooh, horrible." That depends on her perfume.
You say: "Mmm, nice"!
Understood?
Even if she smells of sweat, or chips?
She doesn't smell of chips.
But she's working-class, and they smell of chips.
Did you impart this gem?
Lots of poor people smell of chips.
Haven't you ever noticed?
She doesn't come from a working-class family so she doesn't smell of chips.
She smells nice!
You say: "Mmm, nice", or "Mmm, lovely" and not: "Pooh, horrible'.
"Mmm, lovely"!
And Dove will echo that with a friendly look.
Yes?
Then she says: "Thank you".
A brief silence is in order, and then you continue.
I ask: "Would you care for a drink?"
And then she will of course ask me "What have you got?"
Dove?
Beer, wine, coffee, tea, sherry, whisky various liqeurs and gin.
And mineral water?
Because she's a tee-totaller.
And mineral water.
While Dove's pouring the drinks, you start breaking the ice.
Something about the Iron Curtain?
I don't want to hear the word Iron Curtain!
Why not?
It's something Abel knows a lot about.
Tonight it's ordinary conversations!
Have you got any brothers or sisters?
That's it, that's a good question.
Has she got any, then?
- I don't believe she has.
Then it isn't a good question at all.
I ask, why do you do acting, anyway?
Yes, you ask that.
A conversation develops.
It had better.
I want a spontaneous evening.
One more thing.
I want this understood:
This evening, if I touch my nose like this then Dove puts a record on and you ask her to dance.
And if I run my right hand through my hair, like this then Dove tells that story.
Which story?
The one about the llama in the zoo.
We already know that story.
- We don't already know that story!
Christine, this is Dove, my wife.
Pleased to meet you.
And that is Abel, my son.
Something to drink?
- A glass of gin, perhaps?
Victor must have told you.
Yes...
Let's go and sit down.
What a nice plant.
It looks like a tomato plant.
I'm mad about tomatoes.
But I'm not allowed to eat them.
She's mad about tomatoes.
Would you like a tomato?
I'm not allowed to eat them.
Why not?
Aren't you allowed to eat tomatoes?
Tomatoes belong to the nightshade family.
Everything which belongs to that family is bad for you.
Potatoes, for instance, as well.
Potatoes?
- Yes.
Why do you do acting?
- Me?
I like climbing into someone else's skin.
Can you play things as well as people?
Things?
Could you also climb into the skin of... a potato?
No, no, I can't do that.
I think you'd make a very good potato.
Why do you keep touching your nose?
And now for some more talking.
Isn't it about time for a nice salty herring?
Not for me, thanks.
Don't you like herring?
Rather!
But I'm not allowed to have it.
Is herring also a member of the nightshade family?
No, that's impossible.
- Well then.
Herring is bad for your heart.
Dove!
Don't be absurd.
Let me go.
Leave them for a while...
Ridiculous, it'll come to nothing.
...the children are too small to work in the factory so they can't afford to clothe them.
But their mothers wear long woollen skirts.
And when the children go outside they walk naked under their mother's skirts.
But the cold gives them pneumonia.
They often die by the walkside.
- Time for a top-up, Dove.
No, thank you.
Fish has to swim, you know.
- But I haven't eaten any fish.
Come on, you don't think I feel like telling the story about the llama now?
- What are you talking about?
You're out of step, girlie.
You've got to follow Abel.
I can't dance like this, you know.
No.
You're having an affair.
Night-night.
You're having an affair.
You're having an affair with a beautiful, young, fertile woman.
I can feel it!
Stop it!
Say that you're having an affair.
I'm not having an affair.
Why can't an evening like this evening because you know how to fix things, eh be conducted normally?
Why isn't life normal?
Vickie...
Vickie...
Come now, Christine, your lines.
"I'm not used to" etcetera.
Yes, why not?
Very good, carry on.
Are you my little amateur?
Is that surprising?
With this row going on?
Perhaps we should make it more stimulating.
I did it with a general once, that was exciting.
Have you had an affair with a general?
He wasn't a general.
He just dressed up as a general.
Oh, you mean I should, er...
You could be something else.
What on earth are you wearing?
- A polo-neck.
I thought you couldn't stand polo-necks?
Give it here, woman.
Oh, Victor!
What a lovely red mark!
I'm glad that we're all getting with each other again.
The last time that happened was, I believe, in 1962.
Give over, Victor.
To show you I'm not a bad sod, I've decided tomorrow, I'm going to buy a television.
Where is that television?
Where's the bloody thing?
Damn it!
Please, Vicky, let's talk this over.
- Talk, my foot!
We wanted to surprise you.
- I call it deceit.
Out of this house!
Bloody hell, open this door!
Shut your trap!
I'm going to do you a mischief!
Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
It stinks here.
Move over a bit.
You're in the way.
Victor, Victor.
Please, Victor, please.
- Give him a coat.
Victor, please, please, I beg you!
Too late!
Give him his coat, I said!
You're not really going to throw me out, are you?
Oh no?
What kind of a mug do you think I am?
Give your mother a kiss.
Stop there.
Where?
- There.
What would he be doing in a lunchroom?
Stop!
Where are you going?
Let's make a date.
What are you doing?
- Can't I look for him?
Can I take your arm?
- Why?
Well, all the men around here.
I can't see any men.
- No, but they can see us.
Now they'll think I'm with you.
It was your first time?
It was your first time.
It doesn't matter.
You're just a late developer.
Next, please.
- A dozen oysters.
I was before you!
- You just came in.
Where do you get that idea?
- These people are witnesses.
Are you ladies sorting it out?
There's not much to sort out.
She was first, and that's that.
But I've been standing here for ages.
- It's her turn.
Twenty oysters.
Where is Abel?
Sis?
Sisie?
It's me!
The postman.
Yoohoo!
Sweet Sisie.
Let me in then.
I've got a parcel for you.
A long parcel.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to surprise you.
Who have you got indoors?
No-one.
Victor, we've got to cool it a bit.
Is there someone else?
Yes.
Don't you want to see me anymore?
Sis...
No.
I've got to go now.
- We must talk.
No!
And you're not to come and watch me anymore.
Sis, please!
Is it all over just like that?
That's the way it goes.
Abel.
Hello!
I'm Nick, the walking flannel.
I'm searching for the bald mountain.
Oh look, there it is!
Goodness, isn't it bald.
What are you going to do on that bald mountain?
There's a lot to see from the top of the bald mountain.
Oh, it's so high.
And it's very cold as well.
Freezing cold.
- What can you see?
Nothing.
It's all much too far away.
Can't you see a girl?
A girl?
Yes, I have to look very carefully, though.
Yes, in the distance I can see very vaguely a girl.
And what's that girl doing?
What a nuisance, I can't see from here.
But you could walk over to that girl?
- I can't.
Why not?
- I've only got very tiny legs.
It would take me a whole year to reach that girl.
What now?
- Yes, what now...
Let's just think.
Well, I know.
I need some binoculars.
Are you going to spy on that girl?
Abel?
Girls like to be spied on.
I know where Abel is.
With a woman.
I said so, didn't I?
Why don't you ask me anything?
What I do for a living, for instance.
What do you do for a living?
I'm a teacher.
I'm a model.
I work at Naked Girls.
Teacher?
- No.
Model?
- No.
Naked Girls.
- Yes.
Naked Girls.
Is that a home?
A home?
For what?
A home for naked girls.
At Naked Girls men look at naked girls.
Really?
Only men?
- Yes, and boys.
Aren't you going to ask:
"How did you find him?"
How did you find him?
I saw a woman in the fishmongers wearing Abel's pullover.
The one with the fish, you know.
I followed her.
There's more than one fish-pullover in the world.
I sniffed it.
The pullover.
And what did you smell?
- Abel.
Is he living with this woman?
I think so.
There was a postman at the door this afternoon.
I had something with him.
Was that nice?
Sometimes.
Was he a married man?
- Yes.
Did he have any children?
Yes, a son I think.
But he never wanted to talk about him.
I know that son.
That son is me.
Well, I can tell you a few nice things about your father.
I don't want to hear about my father!
From now on, my father doesn't exist any more!
And your mother?
Tomorrow I'm going to go and fetch Abel.
You leave him alone.
That wretched boy!
I'm not going to take any more notice of you.
Abel's coming back home.
Over my dead body!
- Over your dead body then.
It's him, or me!
What cold hands.
And so dry.
You are alright, aren't you?
Why shouldn't I be alright?
- I don't know.
I'm worried about you.
You always used to have such damp, warm hands.
And now they're suddenly cold and dry.
I don't think you're looking well.
But Sis says I'm looking fine.
You look unhealthy.
And you're wearing an atrocious shirt.
Abel, shall we make it a bit cosier here?
Sis, come on!
Let's go and have a drink somewhere.
Sis, please.
Get in, Sis.
Just a moment.
What d'you think you're doing, rearranging my furniture?
It was her idea.
This is my mother.
- We've already met.
And you just let it happen?
You just kept your mouth shut!
?
Where are the flowers?
She threw them away.
- They were dried out.
That's because they're dried flowers.
"Two housing complexes in eight years."
Is that what you mean, de Beer?
- That's what I mean, yes.
Is that just a statement or are you sliding mud?
I rather think I'm sliding mud.
And it all went too slowly for you, eh?
Haste!
You'll be catching up with your own backside!
Now get lost!
Clear off!
Mind how you speak to my wife, girlie.
I'm used to talking these things through.
Yes, that's true.
We always talk everything through.
Victor's been having an affair with Sis.
With a beautiful, young, fertile woman.
Is that true?
- Yes, it's true.
Is that true?
- Yes, ask Sis.
I hate you!
I don't hate you, you know.
You're a good woman.
But you've got to keep your mitts off Abel.
I'm warning you.
But Dove, you're getting wrinkles, you're not fertile anymore...
You can talk!
Disgusting, disgusting old man!
No, that's not true.
Women grow ugly as they get older but men... they get more interesting.
Anything to drink, Sisie?
A good glass of wine?
Shut up!
Haven't you got a bottle somewhere?
Out!
Both of you!
Right, I'm going.
I'm going.
I'm going!
Don't do it, Dove.
Come on, Dove.
- Don't come any closer!
I'll jump.
Where's Dove?
Dovie?
Where are you?
Oh, Dove.
Do you want a drink as well?
Not one step closer.
Don't come one step closer, d'you hear?
Oh my God!
Victor, please, let's go.
Victor, come on.
Just one more little drinkie.
- Shut up!
I thought it was a very pleasant evening.
Next time, our place?
If I were to bulk up a bit... do you suppose I might make out better with the, um, chicks?
Guaranteed.
We've got trouble.
Clean living, Weasel.
Does wonders, mate.
We've got trouble.
We got trouble.
So?
The tests show no sign of the tumor whatsoever.
No damaged tissue.
No loss of motor skills or mental capacity.
Cut the mumbo jumbo, doc.
By all rights, you should be dead.
Or at the very least brain-damaged.
As I told you before, in an operation as radical as this... considering the experimental techniques we used-
Doc, you mean to tell me-
That's right, Vinnie.
- You're going to live.
- What do you mean, I'm gonna live?
Doc!
My sister wanted me to take care of the children's pets while they're on vacation.
Uh-huh.
Charming collection.
Well, I just hope none of them dies on me.
Frances would have a fit.
Mm-hmm.
I suggest you cut back on those flakes, unless you want to see a goldfish explode.
Oh.
Sorry about your window.
I, uh, tripped.
What were you doing out there?
You, uh, dropped your turtle.
Who are you?
Vinnie Dowd.
I'm in trouble, and I need your help.
- Wouldn't it have been easier to use the door?
- Wait a minute.
Vincent Dowd?
The Le Blanc kidnapping?
Yeah.
Only I didn't do it.
You gotta believe me.
I thought you were convicted of murder.
Life imprisonment.
- Yeah, but I was framed.
- By whom?
- Me.
- You framed yourself?
Did a humdinger of a job, huh?
No.
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Just hold it one minute.
- This is just gonna take a minute.
- All right.
Well, since you put it like that, we'll just sit down.
Okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Take a load off.
- All right.
Don't worry.
- Here we are.
- Okay.
Okay.
I'm a school bus driver.
Right?
I never been sick a day in my life, and then one day- bang!
I black out.
My doctor says I got some sort of terminal brain disease.
So far I'm not surprised.
Well, anyway, you know, that's the breaks.
But at least Nedra- that's my wife- gets my insurance money.
Only we checked the policy, and it doesn't cover that sort of thing.
- How 'bout that, huh?
- Oh-
We're listening, Mr. Dowd.
Yeah, well, anyway, then this famous guy... this exercise guy, Lance Le Blanc, gets kidnapped.
A couple of days pass, and they find the body.
So his wife offers this, uh, huge reward.
$250,000, wasn't it?
Yeah.
In cash.
And I think to myself, holy magnolia!
What if I become the kidnap killer and Nedra collects the reward?
Wait a minute.
The police would see through that in a minute, considering your medical condition.
That's right.
So I devise this plan.
I plant evidence against myself... and then I tip the cops with an anonymous letter, claiming to be my accomplice.
I remember now.
The accomplice was never found, but somehow he got away with the reward money too?
Pretty smart, huh?
Then the cops bust me... and they stake out the P.O. box where I set up for the ransom.
Only they don't know I've already arranged to have the mail forwarded... to another box in a different town.
Where your wife picked it up.
Yeah.!
And suddenly had a quarter of a million dollars.
Everything was going perfect.
Then a couple of months ago, I was strolling around the prison yard... and I started to feel dizzy.
And my head feels like it's gonna spit my eyeballs out or somethin'.
And then- bang!
I hit the deck thinkin'...
"Nedra, this is it, baby.
I'm history. "
And?
And then I wake up in the prison ward of a hospital.
Turns out some young, brilliant doctor used me as a guinea pig, and I'm cured.
I'm gonna live... behind bars for the rest of my life for something I never did!
- So you took a hike?
- Yeah, well, I panicked.
This is the most preposterous story I have ever heard.
Now, look, if you don't believe me, here.
Take it.
Go on.
I'm putting my fate into your hands.
You're my only hope.
You gotta find out who killed Lance Le Blanc and get me off the hook!
Police.
Open up.
Maybe I better keep my fate in my own hands for a while, huh?
- We'll keep in touch.
- Yeah, hey, uh-
- Hi, Laura.
- Detective.
Sorry to bother you.
There's an escaped con in the neighborhood.
Guys are going door to door.
- You haven't seen anything suspicious, have you?
- Well, as a matter of-
We were just wondering what all the commotion was about really.
You remember Mr. Steele.
Uh, Detective Zweigenhauer.
Hoff.
Zweigenhoff.
We met on the Buxton Sears case about a year ago.
Buxton Sears.
- Oh, yes, of course!
Yeah.
How you doing?
- Oh, fine, thank you.
What's that?
Oh, it was just a little accident.
It's a miracle no one was hurt really.
He's in the alley!
Huh.
- Sorry about the turtle.
- Oh!
Oh, boy.
Whoo.
Down, Mildred.
- What a waste.
- Lance Le Blanc?
Lunch?
- A replacement for Phyllis.
- Who's Phyllis?
- A turtle.
- What turtle?
Fill you in later, Mildred.
Now, Laura, about this case.
Don't tell me you believe that story we heard last night.
Actually, Mildred and I have been going over the case, and I think-
Mr. Steele, the man is a condemned murderer.
Condemned men will go to great lengths to escape their fate.
Laura, Laura, Laura.
You just saw Lance on the video just now.
Do you honestly believe that Vinnie killed him?
"With a blow to the head by a blunt object. "
- Of course.
- Lance would've pulverized him just by flexing.
Laura, Laura, Laura.
The man has gone to a lot of trouble to see us.
Now, what if we go over to see Vinnie's wife?
If she doesn't confirm the story, then we drop the whole thing, hey?
- Promise?
- Absolutely.
See that Phyllis has enough water, Mildred.
Ugh!
He told you he was cured?
Mrs. Dowd, we'd like to know if your husband is telling the truth.
Oh!
Oh, my-
Vinnie!
Oh, Nedra.
Oh, Nedra.
Oh.
New skylight, huh?
- Caught me by surprise.
- Vinnie, is it true?
You're really cured?
Yeah, it's true.
It's true.
So, what, did you put this in yourself?
I had it done.
The place looks great.
- Must have cost a fortune.
- Well-
What are you doing here?
We've decided to take the case, Vinnie.
Oh, great!
Would you excuse us just a moment?
What?
Are you aware of the legal ramifications of aiding and abetting an escaped felon?
Unless somebody aids and abets him quickly... he's gonna slice himself to death by falling through windows.
Why are you so determined to help this man?
Let's just say he reminds me of a young man I once knew who was in trouble and on the run.
You really believe he's telling the truth, don't you?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
All right.
We'll take the case.
Oh, great.
On one condition:
He's got to turn himself in.
Oh, no.
No.
I
- I can't do that.
Oh, please, don't make him go back.
Yeah, listen, I can help.
I mean, who knows more about Le Blanc's kidnapping than me?
- Presumably, the kidnapper.
- Besides him.
Uh, he has a point, Laura.
What are we going to do with him?
Uh, well, he, uh- He can stay at my place.
Great!
I don't like this.
Hey, where's my clothes?
Well, Vinnie, I didn't think you were coming back.
So you got rid of all my stuff?
My bowling ball?
Hmm.
Well, I guess I can go like this.
Wait a minute.
There's that bag of clothes for the thrift store.
Maybe there's something in there.
Let's check it out.
Lance Le Blanc was murdered over a year ago.
We have no clues and a cold trail.
Laura, we don't have to solve Lance Le Blanc's kidnapping.
All we have to do is prove that Vinnie didn't do it.
- Too bad he doesn't have an alibi.
- Wait a minute.
I do.
You do?
Yeah.
The night Le Blanc was kidnapped, I was bowling with a guy I used to work with.
Get down, Vinnie, will you.
- What guy?
- Frank Dunn.
Got on the stand, said I was supposed to meet him bowling, but I never showed up.
Will you get down!
He perjured himself for you?
Well, what the heck.
I gave the guy a grand.
- Where does he live?
- Turn right.
I hope Mildred's taking good care of Phyllis.
You have no idea what I went through to find that particular turtle.
Well, you've seen one, you've seen them all.
- Not if you're a six-year-old.
- Uh-huh.
You okay?
Oh.
Uh, me?
Yeah, yeah.
I
- I-
I can't find my car keys.
Ah.
You got a driver's license?
Yes.
Yeah.
Not on me.
But I do have one.
Oh, Frank.
I thought you said your name was Remington Steele.
Yeah, I said that.
Registration says this car belongs to Laura Holt.
Who's she?
- My sister.
- I don't think so.
- My aunt.
- Out of the car.
Vinnie.
Vinnie!
I'm starting to think last night was no coincidence.
Then I say to myself, why would the city's prettiest P. I... a woman who's good enough to run her own shop, be workin' for a guy like Dowd?
We're not working for Dowd.
Come on.
The guy in the car matched the description.
Or what?
Maybe you just lent him the car.
The car was stolen.
- Uh-huh.
- It happens in this city.
Uh-huh.
The question is, what happened to you?
You never would have pulled a stunt like this at Havenhurst.
Something tells me you've got a point, Zweigenheel.
Zweigenheel.
Hey, I like that.
Hoff.
- Zweigenhoff.
- Oh.
And I do have a point.
Somebody offed that guy in the apartment back there.
I think it was Dowd.
I think maybe you know where he is.
Harboring a fugitive is a felony in this state.
We're aware of that.
Three years is a long time to be away.
Not too good for business either.
Thanks for the friendly reminder.
Hey, I'm a friendly guy, Laura.
Oh, we got trouble.
Oh.
Ow.
Sorry about the car.
I
- I panicked.
The car can be fixed.
It's your alibi that needs tending to, mate.
What?
Frank didn't vouch for me?
Frank won't be vouching for anyone anymore.
Frank was murdered.
- Holy magnolia!
- Mm-hmm.
- Vinnie.
Frank Dunn is dead.
- I know.
They just told me.
The police came to the house.
They think you killed Frank.
Somehow, proving Vinnie didn't kidnap Le Blanc no longer seems a viable solution, Miss Holt.
You kids have got your work cut out for you.
Us kids?
What happened to that team spirit, Mildred?
It waned.
Oh.
Whatever we do, it won't be easy with Zweigenhoffer breathing down our necks.
- Hoff.
- Hoff.
I suggest we sequester Vinnie before he causes any more mayhem.
The question is, where?
I think I'm going to regret this... but my sister's away on vacation with her family.
Her place is empty.
Great!
Ned and I'll camp out there.
- Nedra's going home.
- But why?
Well, it's likely the police are still watching your place, Nedra.
It'll only arouse suspicion if you disappear now.
So who's gonna stick with me?
Mildred.
Mildred, Mildred.
Welcome back to the team, Mildred.
Ah, excuse me.
Mrs. Le Blanc?
- Yes?
- Remington Steele.
- And this is Laura Holt.
Oops.
- Hello.
- We'd like to ask you a few questions.
- Sure.
No problem.
Are you interested in bulking up... or just redefining what you've got?
- Uh, actually-
- You look like you're in pretty good shape.
A little more bulk wouldn't hurt.
But you, on the other hand, could definitely use a little more bulk.
Oh, uh, I prefer the lean look.
It's easier on my tailor.
Mrs. Le Blanc, we're private investigators looking into your husband's murder.
The police told me that animal had escaped.
Mrs. Le Blanc, as impossible as it sounds... it's quite possible that "animal" was falsely convicted.
I don't believe that.
Mrs. Le Blanc, at the risk of sounding impertinent... the man who was convicted of kidnapping your husband, if he were innocent... is there anyone you can think of who would bear a grudge against Lance?
Look, am I supposed to be talking to you?
Maybe I should call my attorney.
Uh, Mrs. Le Blanc, it's important.
You see, a man's life may be at stake here.
Okay.
No.
It's inconceivable that anyone could have had a grudge against Lance.
He was a star.
Everybody loved him.
The only thing that I can think of is that some sicko got it into his head... that he could get rich quick by kidnapping my husband.
Can you think of anything that happened, either before or after the kidnapping... that you neglected to tell the police?
No.
Not really.
Well, if you do, we'd appreciate it if you'd call us at this number.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
We've got trouble.
According to the newspaper accounts... the last person to see Lance Le Blanc was a fella by the name ofTony Petz.
Nice name.
Who is he?
Well, he used to work for the Le Blancs.
He's about to open his own gym.
- Just what this city needs: another health club.
- Mmm.
Okay, I'm rowing, right?
Just like I can do at any other health club in town.
Now check this out.
It's still got a few bugs, but that's the general idea.
Total environmental experience.
Working out becomes an adventure.
- A fantasy.
- Uh-huh.
But if you don't like the jungle, we've got space.
And if space isn't your cup of tea, we've got Hawaii.
- Great.
- But that's not all.
By this time next month, our circle-vision pool will be completed... and you can swim anywhere in the world without leaving this club.
Pretty wild, huh?
Mr. Petz, exactly what does all this have to do with exercise?
Exercise?
We're not selling exercise here.
We're selling lifestyle.
You want exercise, drop down and give me 30 push-ups.
But if you want to be part of what's happening, you gotta join the Aerobitorium.
Soon as this place catches on, I'm gonna make millions.
Let's hope you put a little something away until then, eh?
That's not funny.
This place has gotta make it.
Well, Mr. Petz, about Lance Le Blanc-
He gave me my start.
I was a 98-pound weakling until I met Lance.
Actually, he was the first bodybuilder... to break away from the all-brawn, no-brains syndrome.
Chicks loved the guy.
Yes, well, according to his wife... every- everybody, uh, loved the guy.
That's just the kind of guy he was.
You were the last person to see Lance on the night that he was kidnapped.
- That's right.
- What happened?
Uh, I was working for him at the time.
It was about 5:00 in the evening.
Gym was closed.
He went out.
I guess the poor guy never made it to his car.
Did you see or hear anything unusual?
No.
He went out, and I went in and took a shower.
- After you.
- Thank you.
Can you think of anyone, Mr. Petz, who may have had a reason to kidnap Lance?
Nah.
You kiddin'?
Lance was a great guy with a killer body.
I think it was just, uh, one of those freak things.
You know?
That seems to be the common presumption in this case.
Well, thank you, Mr. Pecs.
- Mr. Steele?
- Yes, Miss Holt.
Yes.
Ah, Tony, um-Just a thought.
If, uh
- If I were to bulk up a bit... do you suppose I might make out better with the, um, chicks?
You kiddin'?
Guaranteed!
You, uh- You guys do pretty well, eh?
Oh, man, that's the understatement of the year.
- You think money's the only reason I'm in this business?
I guess, uh
- I guess Lance... didn't know what he was missing then, eh?
What do you mean?
Well, marriage, uh... being tied down, all that kind of thing.
I'll let you in on a little secret.
You know where Lance was supposed to go the night that he was snatched?
- Uh-uh.
- Tuttle's.
Tuttle's?
A restaurant?
A mansion.
A Beverly Hills mansion.
And I don't think he was ordering off of the menu, if you know what I mean.
- Mr. Steele?
- Yes, Miss Holt.
Coming.
Hey.
Next time you want to work up an appetite-
Ah!
Gotcha.
We've got trouble.
Spaghetti for two.!
How could you be jolly in the jam you're in?
You gotta remember, I'm supposed to be dead.
At this point, you're not much better off.
At least there's hope.
Needs salt.
- Salt?
- Mm-hmm.
Oregano, maybe, but salt, no.
Voilà.
At least that spiced things up a little bit, huh?
Hit the deck!
Vinnie, run!
Ohh!
We got trouble.
Good Lord!
Wait till Frances see this.
Never mind Frances.
What about Mildred and Vinnie?
Oh, my God.
- We have to stop meeting like this.
- Very funny.
Somebody was working on a delicious meal.
It's a shame it had to go to waste.
Steele.
There are no bodies here.
Nobody was killed.
In fact, there was nobody here at all by the time we got here.
- So you just let yourself in?
- Key was under the mat.
- Looks like they had one hell of a party, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
Neighbors weren't too happy about it.
They didn't mind the singing.
It was the gunshots that bothered them.
Donald Piper, dentist.
Wife, the former Frances Holt.
That would make her what?
Your sister?
Could you just please be careful!
It's a little late for that, Laura.
Things aren't adding up too good for you and Mr. G.Q. here.
Hmm.
I know you're workin' for Dowd.
I know Dowd was here.
I suspect your sister's not gonna be too happy with the way he left the place.
Your boys aren't doing much better.
What I don't understand is why.
Why are you working for this guy?
You know how I feel about him.
Convicted.
Glenn Ford, Broderick Crawford.
Columbia, 1950.
Ford plays an innocent man convicted to life imprisonment for a murder he didn't commit.
Ruth Roman played the dame, right?
Dorothy Malone actually.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I was in love with her too.
Mapes.
- I take it you guys think Dowd is innocent?
- It's possible.
Why don't you come down to the station.
I'll show you the case file.
- I think I'll change your mind.
- Some other time.
Hey.
Hope I catch up to him before you do.
I wouldn't want to be the guy to put you out of business.
Like you too much.
Lock up when you leave.
Someone must have followed Mildred and Vinnie from the office.
The question is, where are they right now?
Mildred?
Uh, oh, Frances.
Uh
- Uh, yes, she's right here.
What?
Hello?
Frances?
Fr-
Frances, look-
Frances, stay calm.
Frances-
You got a call from a neighbor.
Yes.
W-Well- No, no, no, no.
It's not that bad.
Uh, couple of thousand maybe.
Five at the most.
Look, Frances, I can't talk right now.
I have to keep this line open.
- Why-
- Don't-
Franc- Mildred?
Mildred, where are you?
Where?
Unless I'm mistaken, that hunk of scrap metal was your sister's car.
We'd better solve this case before our one-man wrecking crew gets his hands on anything else.
Hi.
Sorry about your sister's car.
- You panicked.
- Yeah, how'd you know?
- Oh-
- Gut instinct.
What happened, Mildred?
- Some guy tried to put our lights out.
- Did you get a look at him?
- Are you kidding?
- We were running for our lives.
- Terrific.
- What do we do now?
So, what do we do?
I've been thinking.
This whole thing just doesn't add up.
Lance Le Blanc is kidnapped in broad daylight, from in front of his own gym... and there are no witnesses?
Two days later, his wife receives a note demanding the ransom be dropped... in a phone booth at a busy intersection?
Where it's never picked up.
Meanwhile, no one hears from the kidnappers again.
Now that you mention it, according to the newspaper... the coroner determined that Lance was already dead... by the time the ransom note was delivered.
What do you think?
Could it be that Lance was murdered... and his kidnapping was a ruse to hide the murderer's real motive?
Holy magnolia!
You mean I framed myself for a kidnapping that never happened?
What an idiot!
So, then whoever did it must've thought they had it made in the shade when I confessed.
He's probably quaking in his boots until you get back behind bars.
- Or dead.
- Don't panic, Vinnie.
We may not have much to go on, but we're ahead of the game.
Mildred, go back to the office, check Lance's insurance records.
Someone must have benefited from his untimely demise.
- What are you gonna do?
- Pay a visit on one of Lance's closest friends.
Come on.
I don't know how I can be of any help.
Lance Le Blanc was my coach.
That's all.
I didn't really know him that well.
Mrs. Tuttle, according to our sources...
Lance was more than just your coach.
Unzip me.
- I don't have to talk to you people.
- But you are.
Why is that, I wonder?
- Perhaps we should speak to your husband about it.
- No!
I always heard private detectives were sleazy.
Oh, come now, Mrs. Tuttle... our distinguished colleague here, Mr. Enriquez, from south of the border... has an impeccable reputation.
But it's not his reputation that's on the line now, is it?
You were with Lance on the night he disappeared, weren't you, Mrs. Tuttle?
- How much do you want?
- Just the truth.
All right.
Yes, I was with Lance that night.
But I didn't have anything to do with his murder.
Did your husband realize the extent to which you and Lance were... working out?
Of course not.
Lance and I were-
Look, it was just a fling, for both of us.
- He was never going to leave his wife.
- How do you know that?
Because she was the brains behind his business.
He wanted out, but he said he couldn't afford it.
- Where was Lance going when he left you?
- I don't know.
He just said he had a problem to take care of.
I think it might be prudent if we had another talk with Heather Le Blanc.
Don't you agree, Mr. Enriquez?
Hmm?
Uh, sí.
- Can you teach me how to pick a lock like that?
- Shh.
Oh, my!
Holy magnolia!
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Guess what.
You're under arrest!
Thank you.
Boy, Zweigenhoff must really have it in for you guys.
Bail was pretty steep.
- Mildred, what did you come up with on Lance?
- Not much.
No life insurance.
Most of his business holdings was in his wife's name.
He had patents on his exercise equipment, copyrights on his diet program, stuff like that.
- She had a lot of money and no debts.
- Great.
Two people are dead, we've been arrested, Vinnie's on the loose, and we have no suspects.
- Any word from Vinnie?
- Not a peep.
Where do you think he is?
Ah-
Vinnie!
Pack up your bags, sweetheart.
- Where are we going?
- Mexico!
We haven't got time for a game of eight ball, Mr. Steele.
- Lance Le Blanc wanted out of his marriage.
Correct?
- So?
So, he couldn't divorce Heather... because the very things that had made him rich and famous were in her name.
Mrs. Tuttle said the night he left her, he was going off to solve his problem.
I liked it better when you came up with old movie quotes to solve a case.
I don't follow you.
Laura, look, I may be grasping at straws, but I think Lance hired someone to kill his wife.
Then how do you explain the fact that Lance ended up dead?
I can't.
But if I had the same problem he did, I'd know who to talk to.
- Hey.
- Steele!
How you doin'?
Good.
Good.
You still hangin' around with Mary Magdalene over here?
- Cruella De Vil was busy.
- That's very amusing.
So, what can I do you out of this time, Steele?
You remember a bodybuilder by the name of Lance Le Blanc?
Sure.
Got whacked out about a year ago.
I think he may have put a hit out on his wife before he was killed.
Nice guy.
We thought you may have heard something.
Nope.
You must have heard something.
- Lady, it was a long time ago.
- Think!
- Hey, what's with you?
Is she always like this?
- It's part of her charm.
However, now that you mention it...
I do remember something going around about it at the time.
Any names?
Never are.
Six ball.
Corner pocket.
However, Lance had this buddy.
He used to dabble in the area of artificial persuasion.
But I never heard of him erasing' anybody.
Name.
What's the name?
What's the name?
Petz.
Tony Petz.
Let's go.
- May I?
- Oh, yeah, Steele.
Go ahead.
Clean living, Weasel.
Does wonders, mate.
Take care.
Hello, Tony.
Let's talk about the contract Lance Le Blanc put out on his wife.
Laura?
Ohh.
Remington Steele Investigations.
- Yeah, I just called to say good-bye.
- Good-bye?
Where are you going?
South of the border.
Nedra says we can live like kings down there.
No, Vinnie, wait.
I don't think you should go anywhere until you talk to Mr. Steele.
Sorry.
Too late.
Bus leaves in, uh, 20 minutes.
Tell him I said nice try, and we'll send him a postcard.
Come on.
Vinnie!
Vinnie-
Detective Zweigenhoff.
Go ahead.
Tap on Steele's phone paid off.
- Dowd's at the bus station.
We're on our way.
- I'm right behind you.
And, Mapes, nobody makes a move till I get there.
If Lance hired Tony to kill his wife, then who killed Lance?
- Same person that killed Tony Petz?
- Who killed Frank Dunn?
- Who killed Heather?
- Who's left?
Vinnie.
Laura, have a look at this.
"Bodybuilder whips police into shape. "
"Detective Steve Zweigenhoff... presents certificate of appreciation to... "
Tony Petz?
Zweigenhoff knew Petz?
What does that mean?
I don't know, but the skin on the back of my neck is beginning to crawl.
Something tells me we'd better find Vinnie before Zweigenhoff does.
Mildred, have you heard from Vinnie?
How long ago?
Thanks.
- He's at the bus depot.
- Fred.
- He's inside.
- I'll handle it.
- What?
Alone?
- The man is armed and dangerous.
I don't want a bloodbath in there.
Vincent Dowd.
Run.
What?
Run!
Take off.
Hey!
- Here's your murderer, Sergeant.
- The lieutenant?
Zweigenhoff's the killer?
Yes, Mildred.
Surprised us too.
He's not the guy that came at us at your sister's.
I thought you said you didn't get a good look at him.
- Good enough to know it wasn't him.
- What?
There are two people trying to stop Vinnie?
Ohh!
Go!
Oh, thank you.
- Wolfe?
- What?
You know him?
Yeah, he's- He's my downstairs neighbor.
But what's he-
Nedra.
- I'm sorry, Vinnie.
- You and Wolfe?
You knew that if Vinnie cleared himself, you'd have to give back the money.
I figured I could always get another husband.
But where could I get another $250,000?
She does have a point.
It's really very simple, Mildred, once you get the players straight.
Mm-hmm.
Lance Le Blanc hired Tony Petz to kill his wife.
Tony took the money, but found he couldn't carry out the deed.
Uh-huh.
So Tony hired his pal Zweigenhoff to kill Heather.
- Only Zweigenhoff fell in love with her.
- Uh-huh.
On the night that Zweigenhoff was gonna kill Heather...
Lance surprised them, by coming home early.
There was a fight and Zweigenhoff killed him.
That's when Heather and Zweigenhoff... concocted the kidnapping plan to cover up their murder.
- It would've worked, too, if it hadn't been for Vinnie.
- Uh-huh.
- You don't seem very interested in any of this.
- Oh, I am, boss.
It's just that Phyllis went AWOL.
- Phyllis?
- The turtle.
Maybe I should have gotten her a leash.
Hey, guys, guess what-
GREY HOME
Episode 04
- Silja
State in the closed sector:
regular.
Sixteen.
One less.
- No way!
Is there any news?
All as usual.
That's better.
Until the next time.
There will be no next time, Crni.
- I say, there will be.
As long as I'm in charge here, no.
Chombe.
You omelette is not salty enough.
Don't, Chombe.
It's not healthy without salt.
Now taste it.
Taste it.
Come on, Jezerkic.
That's how one eats bread.
First someone crumbles up for you, and then you eat it.
Right?
Eat.
One drinks tea with vinegar.
You whore.
Who thought of it?
What...?
I ask you, whose idea was provoking Silja?
Mr Zeka, how could I provoke someone who's five times stronger than me?
He could kill me with one hit.
I can't.
I have a heart failure.
How could I pick on anyone?
Right.
You'd never pick on him.
And on his last day in the hall!
Was that Sojka's idea?
He's envious because Silja goes home, so he wants to provoke him to fight, right?
Sojka!
Come on, I see you.
They don't wanna rat on you, but I know it was you who thought of it.
It's not your first time doing this, anyway.
- That's never proven.
I won't prove it to you.
I'll just put you in closed area.
I'll sue you to the principal.
I know my rights, and I know I did nothing wrong.
These here are small rodents.
One buys 'em for five cakes and chewing gums.
Somebody else could have bribed them, too.
Why would I care about Silja?
I never had anything with him.
What is my motif for provoking him?
He may go home, I don't care.
That's the catch.
You do everything without motif.
You like to play bigshot.
- They say, but that's not true.
He hardly got out of hell.
You wanna put him back there?
I warn you...
Leave Silja alone.
What a shithead!
- Give us fags now.
Do you have a cigar?
- You shouldn't smoke because of heart.
Give me one.
America, my son...
America!
- Give me just one poof.
On your reponsibility.
Give head.
Pull!
Give me some to have 'em in my pocket.
- Whine.
I wanna hear you whining for a fag.
Leave that!
You rascals...
Brats.
Do I bother you?
- No.
How the business is going?
Somehow.
Looks like it will rain.
- Rain?
No way.
Come in.
Excuse me.
May I ask you to leave my suitcase here until the morning?
My goods will be ruined, and I sleep far away from here.
Alright.
Put it there.
Why do you lock it up?
You think someone will rob you?
You never know.
- Do you have an umbrella?
I'll put newspapers on my head.
I'm thankful for your kindness.
I have one.
Come with me.
Until we separate.
Newspapers are poor protection.
You waited up for the day.
Good morning!
- Oh, good morning.
A true cold this morning, eh?
Well, seems like a fever too.
I guess I shouldn't be working today.
Let me just take my suitcases and go to bed.
Your wish.
Bye, and thank you.
You dropped me again.
- Sorry.
You will hurt cars, and maybe even people.
Will you give a fag?
Will you give the weights?
Will you give Nastasja?
I'll go for a sleep.
And you don't leave without waking me up.
If the going gets tough, and I hope that won't happen, call.
Here, or at my home.
Wherever you find me.
Scram!
All I want at this very moment:
Go, go away from my life
My heart burnt out
And the soul's left without its own
Once I had a cheerful times with you
But then a star fell from the sky
Now I'm left with pale photo only
Which your sister once gave me
Where are you heading to?
What's this?
I can't read it.
How much time you did?
I did five.
So, there's no return now?
Come on, scram.
Joke.
Principal!
How come you're playing, too?
I knew you were about to come.
So I thought I could surprise you.
You're so nice lately, aren't you?
- In honor of our upcoming separation.
As far as I know, I'll be staying on my duty here.
But I won't be here.
How do you think to manage this?
By flying?
Kinda.
Guards!
He flew away for real.
Hallo?
Hallo, Krusevac.
Don't hang up.
Who's hanging up there?
I'm working.
I'm on the line.
Ok.
Hey, there goes my moped.
Call the police!
Police!
Kids, get him!
Stop!
Our methods are too weak for him.
Only time can crush him.
Even Mengele, principal.
Mengele.
They have too much freedom.
You throw a rock into the water, and it sinks.
But when you hold it tight, it's yours.
You can do with it whatever you want.
He was caught five times already.
He will probably be for the sixth time now.
Now I'm only interested in what kind of way he'll escape.
He's wise.
Knows how to think.
If I only weren't the principal, I would...
- Shake his hand for this?
Had you dealt with him differently from the start, this wouldn't be happening now.
Had he experienced your methods, right?
There are moments when you say that only I can solve some problems.
But I always feel sorry when I have to admit that.
But you do admit.
Mr principal, they called saying it's indicative that he jumped the train for Belgrade.
We called the police station.
What does it mean?
As if you chased him yourself.
Go there, and inform us.
Crni ran away again.
Strange he didn't take you along.
He's with different chick every time.
Doesn't even remember you.
YOU will say that?
- Why shouldn't I?
What are you doing you two?
Come on, cut the hair.
Who?
Come on.
When did we have Russian TV set?
Never.
And boiler?
Two years old.
Almost new.
Mom's gonna be happy!
What about coats?
Garbardin.
Two-sided, for autumn and spring season.
Dark gray.
- What about cash?
He gave 300 grands.
He had no more.
I saw it myself.
He'll send by the mail as soon as he gets money.
300 grands for all that gold?
- Wanna find someone else who'd rat on us?
Why you're yelling?
- I don't.
Is it free?
- Velizar, is it free or not?
Free.
Good evening.
Shhh... they are sleeping.
- Leave it.
Honest people.
Your ID.
I don't have it.
- How can you not have your ID?
I left today.
- Where are you left from?
From Krusevac.
- You don't have ID?
I don't have it, but I have discharge paper from Krusevac.
I was released home.
- What's this on your hand?
I burned myself.
- Or you've been jumping the wire?
What wire?
Folks, are you crazy?
I have discharge paper.
I was left home.
I was left home.
I have discharge paper with me.
Sit down!
Get down.
You overdo it, Vule.
I have discharge paper, folks.
- What paper!
?
Why don't you look in the bag?
- Get that bag.
We fucked up, man.
Look!
Hey, fellas!
You're looking for me, aren't you?
Go.
Say, when comes the next train to Belgrade?
In five minutes.
Hold it!
Don't mess.
Winter is not a good time for swimming.
Easy, one by one.
Grandpa, give me a fag.
It's cold!
You see how shallow it is?
Grandpa, please give me one fag.
I go right.
And you?
Where do you think you're going, kid?
Take him.
Dragoslav!
Silja!
I went to hairdresser's.
I wanted to welcome you with nice haircut, so I was late for the bus.
It's ok, mum.
Everything's over.
Fuck, I don't have a ticket.
- Wait.
For you.
- From who?
From me.
It's hand-made.
There's inscription, too.
Eiffel Tower?
"To my mother Tomanija."
"From Silja".
There you go.
The most important thing is that you came back.
Now it's gonna be much better than before.
You know that they found you a job?
Maybe you'll go to Libya.
There's lots of construction there.
You have a nice fur coat.
- It looks like original, doesn't it?
It's not original?
- No, it's plastic mass.
Like it's original.
- Is it?
Synthetics.
Doesn't matter.
You know, years go by and I'm alone.
He's a good man.
You know Mr Ostoja, the caterer?
Man with moustaches.
Grillmaker?
- Yes.
Now he has steakhouse.
And his own waiter, too.
He works a lot.
He's nervous.
You wouldn't get along with him well.
That's why I rented a room for you at Mrs Bojka's.
You shouldn't have to, mom.
I'll find room myself.
She will cook for you, too.
You're in a hurry?
- No...
We may sit some more.
Why don't you order something?
Why don't your mother treat you?
There, I ordered a coffee.
- Why don't you have something else, too?
Are you mad with me?
No...
Why's that for?
I will drop by every day at Mrs Bojka's to visit you.
No, you just sit.
I will go.
Eat that cream pie.
And then go.
Don't hang around with your old mates anymore.
For your mom's love.
Mom, will you take this?
He has small children from his first marriage.
I had to accept them.
They broke everything around my house.
I'm afraid they will destroy that, too.
Maggie, what's Uncle Bob doing sleeping in my office?
He and Mike played poker last night.
- Mike won his room back.
- Really?
I'm glad to see Mike getting the upper hand for a change.
Me, too.
Too bad he lost your car.
Maybe Uncle Bob wouldn't mind giving us a lift to the store later.
Where's Uncle Bob?
- Still asleep, I guess.
- You mean, he's not up yet?
Thank you, God.
Dad, can I borrow some of your shaving cream?
I'd give it a while.
Come on, Mom.
I may never get another chance like this again.
He's sprayed me four mornings in a row.
Four mornings in a row?
- Take no prisoners.
- Yes, sir.
- You're bad.
- Always support the home team.
Ben and I have $10 saying Uncle Bob beats Mike in the limbo contest.
Want a piece of the action?
You two ought to be ashamed of yourselves... betting against your own brother.
Your mother's right, kids.
But it was Mike's idea.
I mean, he said he'd cover any bet against him.
- And he's giving 3-to-1 odds.
- 3-to1, whoa.
- Jason.
- I'm just scratching.
Mike?
He's dead.
Oh, my God.
For those of you that cried at the funeral...
I just want to say that it's nothing to be ashamed of.
Thank you, Maggie.
Well, are we all ready?
- This feels kind of strange, Mom.
- It won't after we get started, honey.
Uncle Bob called this a remembering session.
When someone in my family passed on...
Uncle Bob would lead us all in sharing fond memories of that person.
Whom he would lovingly refer to as "The dearly defunct."
Who wants to start?
Okay, then, I will.
When I was a little girl...
I wanted to be a dancer.
And do you know why?
Why?
Because Uncle Bob took me to my very first ballet.
And I remember he said, "They walk around on their toes...
"they do flapping things with their arms, and it doesn't make any sense.
"But it's pretty, ain't it?"
Remember when I had my appendix taken out... and Uncle Bob brought me one in a jar and told me not to worry... 'cause he knew how to put it back in.
Yeah, and when the nurse came, he showed her the jar... and said he got it out of the soda machine.
And then he said he wanted his quarter back.
And remember what to do when passing slow cars on the road?
Stroke.
Stroke.
Stroke.
I remember how much fun it was... when Uncle Bob would make Mike lose.
What?
He could run faster, shoot baskets better.
He played games like a champ.
- I let him win.
- Sure you did.
Remember the last visit?
They're in the homestretch and it's not even close.
Jason, he lost again.
He'll be crushed.
I know.
He tries so hard, too.
Here he comes.
- And the winner is?
- Uncle Bob by a mile.
Uncle Bob!
Uncle Bob!
B-O-B.
Uncle Bob!
Please, please.
Just throw paper money.
Congratulations.
Are you through humiliating my son for the evening?
- I don't know.
Carol?
- We can make it if we hurry.
Let's do it.
So the other fellow says:
"If I could walk that way, I wouldn't need talcum powder."
At least you're not the kind of guy who likes to rub it in.
Thanks for the help, guys.
Are you kidding?
We live for stuff like this.
- Don't let them tease you, Son.
- That's all right, Dad.
I can take it.
Attaboy.
You want some pizza?
Uncle Bob stopped for one on the way back.
Come on, pal.
Don't take it so hard.
You know you're my favorite nephew.
- What's your name again?
- All right, look, you beat me again... but I'm young, and sooner or later I'm going to come out on top.
Glutton for punishment.
Shall we say running shoes at dawn?
- You're on.
- All right.
I'm first in the shower.
How about that.
Mike finally got the best of you at something.
Not really.
I took the knobs off the shower.
I didn't want to take a shower.
Your turn, Mike.
What do you remember?
Deuces, jacks, man with an ax.
Pair of natural sevens takes all.
That's poker.
I loved to play poker with Uncle Bob, even if he did always win.
Boy, she was some beautiful dame.
I thought we'd always be together.
Then the war came.
She shipped out.
I gave her a carton of cigarettes.
Your bet.
Yeah, that's some sad story.
I mean, the love of your life.
- Didn't you ever meet anyone else?
- No one like her.
Two jacks.
We'll always have Milwaukee.
Hey, Uncle Bob... there's this girl in my geometry class that I like.
- When I look at her, I get the chills.
- Put a jacket on.
You got a D in geometry.
Now, you can do better than that, you hear?
- I know.
I'm trying.
- One.
- Try harder.
- I will.
I bet $10.
All right, I'll see your $10, and I'll raise $10 more.
- Call.
What have you got?
- I got three aces.
Full house, nines and fours.
I can't believe it, you win every hand.
Mikey, Mikey, I'm four times older than you.
I've got experience.
One day you'll have experience, though I wouldn't hold my breath.
Holy mackerel!
Would you look at the time?
Your mother's going to kill me for keeping you up this late.
Oh, no, that's okay.
Really.
She lets me get away with everything when it comes to you.
She does?
Let's go downtown and get some tattoos.
- You got tattooed?
- He was just kidding.
The most important thing I ever learned from Uncle Bob... was just never draw to an inside straight.
Hey, you remember that Thanksgiving... when Uncle Bob brought the whole turkey out... and he put it in front of big, old Aunt Doris?
And he said, "You go ahead and start.
Ours will be out in a minute."
All right, already.
Look, you wake me up at 3:30 in the morning.
I say, "No problem."
I come down here and what do I get for you?
Buttermilk.
That's right, buttermilk.
I hate buttermilk.
But I'm going to drink some right now.
You know why?
Because you like it.
That's right.
There, am I your buddy or what?
You betcha.
Morning, Mike.
It was just a dream.
It didn't really happen.
My bed, I love you.
Thank you for making it only a dream.
And my pillow.
I love you, pillow.
Breakfast is ready.
I can explain all this.
Don't bother, Mike.
We've known about you and your pillow for a long time now.
She just doesn't understand.
Sorry, I'm late, guys.
I just had this really weird nightmare last night.
Is that the one where you show up for your final exam... with less than a minute to go?
No, that actually happened.
But it was just as crazy.
I mean, I was pretty glad when I woke up.
I'll say.
Well, now that we're all here... does anyone want to tell me who spilled buttermilk on the floor?
A simple confession will do.
- Are you all right, Mike?
- Yeah.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
Something just went down the wrong pipe.
I'm in big trouble.
And the tension's really building here, charade fans.
The girls are ahead, and Mike Seaver's coming up for his next turn.
It's almost midnight, Mike.
Can't we just call it a night?
What, and end all the fun?
- I'm tired.
- Me, too.
Come on.
Okay, here we go, Dad.
It's a movie.
Three words.
First word.
Sounds like a monster.
A monster with a car.
Oh, no, not another Godzilla movie.
Ben, what's the second word in every Godzilla movie?
- Meets.
- Right.
Godzilla meets...
Margaret Thatcher.
I'll give you a hint.
It's Frankenstein.
I'm going to bed.
- Me, too.
Let's go up.
- Thank God.
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
How about a game of Monopoly?
Now, there's a game that's just fun for all ages.
Mike, we've played Monopoly.
And we've played Scrabble, Parcheesi, and ball tag.
I mean, there's a limit to how much fun a family can stand in one night.
And we passed it about two hours ago.
Coming, Mike?
No, I think I'll get on the horn and see who's around.
At midnight?
- How about a quick game of Uncle Wiggly?
- All right.
Wrong.
Night, Mike.
- Mike, you okay?
- Yeah, fine, great.
Just feeling wonderful.
Sure you don't want to talk about it for a minute?
No, there's really nothing to talk about, Dad.
Really.
Okay.
Good night.
Dad, what happens to people when they die?
This could take longer than a minute.
If it takes all night, it's okay by me.
Okay.
Some people believe that when you die, you go to heaven or hell.
Some people believe that... then you come back again to live on earth... and the kind of life you have then... will depend on the kind of person you were.
Some people believe that you keep coming back... in a higher form each time until you reach the ultimate.
Professional basketball player?
Could be.
If you're not good, you come back as a lawyer.
Where do practical-joking joggers fit in?
Hopefully pretty high.
- Dad, I saw him.
- You saw who?
Uncle Bob.
Last night I was drinking buttermilk... and he ran through the kitchen, just like he was alive.
Maybe you were dreaming.
- Dad, the buttermilk spilled, remember?
- Yeah.
Was it possible, or am I just losing my mind?
You could have been sleepwalking, Mike.
You know, the imagination is...
I knew you would say that.
Dad, do you believe in ghosts?
- Well...
- I didn't think so.
I believe that you believe that you saw Uncle Bob.
I did.
Dad, what does he want from me?
What did he say?
He said, "Hi, Mike."
Sounds pretty friendly.
Dad, I don't know what do.
And I know he'll be back.
- Why don't you talk to him?
- I should just have a chat with a dead guy?
Either that or we're going to be playing a lot of charades around here.
And you're already out of Godzilla movies.
I don't know.
What's to be afraid of?
You act like he's a bad guy and you know he loved you.
Maybe he's changed.
Mike, if you really believe that you've seen Uncle Bob... then you should ask him what he wants.
- You say stuff like this to your patients?
- Yes.
And they give you money for this?
It doesn't matter what I believe, Mike.
What matters is that even if your mind played a trick on you... it did it for a reason.
And the best way of discovering that reason is to ask.
- Uncle Bob.
- Or your image of him.
You understand?
I couldn't just do this by mail?
Yeah, if you have the address.
Okay.
I'm going to do it.
I'm gonna go in there, I'm gonna face my fear.
I'm gonna be a man.
I'm gonna be a man.
I'm gonna be a man.
I'm gonna be a...
Starting tomorrow.
Be a man.
Be a man.
Be a man.
Be a man.
I'm in the kitchen.
I'm at the refrigerator.
I'm taking out the buttermilk.
It was a dream.
It didn't really happen.
There's no such thing as ghosts.
I was a man.
I faced it and it went away.
I'll never see Uncle Bob again.
Morning, Mike.
Mommy.
No, Mike.
Be a man.
You're gonna be a man.
- Uncle Bob?
- What's up, Mike?
Nothing.
Carry on.
What about that limbo contest?
$10 still says I can beat you, huh?
- Look, what do you want from me?
- What do I want from you?
I want your $10, right?
Look, you can have $20.
I don't care.
Anything you want.
- Just quit haunting me!
- Haunting you?
I was just kidding you, Mike.
Try to lighten up.
Look, don't touch me.
Mike, don't take this wrong...
- but you're acting a little strange.
- I'm acting strange?
Look, you're running a 10K in my kitchen and you're dead.
10K?
- I'm what?
- I'm sorry to have to be the one to tell you.
Not half as sorry as I am to hear it.
You're sure about this?
Yeah, I'm positive.
I went to your funeral on Friday.
Good funeral?
Yeah, good funeral.
Lot of people came.
Dad cried.
Good old Jason, huh?
Did Jack Hollard show up?
He always said he was going to belly-up before...
What am I saying?
What am I saying?
I'm not dead!
I'm alive!
You had me going for a minute.
I can see I'm not getting my point across here.
Look, Uncle Bob, what have you been doing for the last week?
I don't know.
The usual stuff, I guess.
- Like what?
- Like running and...
- Have you talked to anybody?
- Yeah.
- Who?
- You, of course.
Who else?
You know, that's crazy, but...
I can't remember talking to anyone else this week but you.
- What do you remember?
- Running, mostly.
Boy, I had some good runs this week.
Uncle Bob, don't you think it's a little weird... to spend a whole week doing nothing but running?
Yeah, that is weird, huh?
Real weird.
I just don't know why I didn't see it before.
I'm dead.
Seems simple enough now, huh?
I want to thank you, Michael.
Hey, don't mention it.
It was just something I thought you should know.
I have to go now.
- What, right now?
- Yeah.
- Uncle Bob, wait.
- Way past my time.
- Wait, Uncle Bob.
- Yes, Michael?
Where are you going?
You just can't leave me here like this.
Don't worry, Michael.
It's all right.
Really.
No, it's not.
I mean, I'm never going to see you again!
You're leaving me, there's not a thing I can do about it, right?
- Sure there is.
- What?
Remember me.
- What?
- Remember me.
Remember the time your mom made sushi... and we all dressed up in Japanese costume?
Yeah, and you came as Godzilla.
I knew it was your favorite movie star.
Remember all the corny jokes we used to tell, huh?
- How do two porcupines make love?
- Very carefully.
Remember the time I died in the den and you put whipped cream on my face?
I didn't know you were dead.
Wait a minute, if you were dead... how did you know about the whipped cream?
I know a lot of things I didn't know before.
Mike, I'm sorry I always teased you and tried to embarrass you.
That's okay.
I mean, humiliation builds character.
There you go then.
You see, I'm not leaving you.
I'm in your memory.
I'm in your character.
I'm part of you.
Goodbye, Mike.
Goodbye, Uncle Bob.
I guess I'd better get to bed.
Unless I'm already up there.
Morning, Mike.
- Did you sleep all right, last night?
- Yeah, no problem.
- I worked the whole thing out.
- No more fears?
No, not this cowboy.
- Great.
All right.
See you at breakfast.
- Okay.
Come on, Mike.
How many times do I have to tell you not to leave your towels lying around?
Hey, Mom, this isn't my towel.
English
Head and shoulders.
Knees and toes, Knees and toes.
Eyes and mouth and ears and nose.
Ears and nose...
Where are we?
We're in the garden.
What, your garden?
No, silly!
The palace garden.
Look!
There's Sylvia!
What's she doing?
She's doing her exercises.
Knees and nose, knees and toes...
Quick!
Behind this thing!
-What thing?
-The statue.
-Are you all right?
-No, we aren't.
We're hungry.
Can we have some food, please?
Can I have a clock, please?
A clock?
Excuse me.
Yes.
A clock.
He likes clocks.
Somebody's coming.
Who is it?
I don't know.
I can't see.
OK!
Oh, no!
It's raining.
Look, wait over there.
-OK.
-See you this evening.
-When?
-Seven o'clock.
See you at seven this evening.
Seven o'clock.
Right!
What's the time now?
It's eight o'clock.
Hello?

Busy?
No, I'm going to bed.
Good night!
One o'clock.
It's lunch-time.
It's lunch-time, dear.
I'm coming.
It's lunch-time, Sylvia.
I'm not very well.
Can I have lunch in my room?
What's the matter?
I've got a terrible headache.
A headache.
Stomachache.
Toothache.
Backache.
Come in.
What's the matter?
I've got a headache, doctor.
A headache?
Take this.
Thank you, doctor.
Next!
What's the matter?
I've got stomachache, doctor.
Stomachache?
Take this.
Thank you, doctor.

What's the matter?
I've got backache, doctor.
Backache?
Take this.
Thank you, doctor.
A headache?
Stay in your room, dear, and have a rest.
Lunch for the Princess in her room!
Sylvia isn't very well.
She's got a headache.
She's got a headache.
She's having lunch in her room.
-His.
-Her.
-Her knife.
-His knife.
-His fork.

I'm going to the swimming pool.

Have a nice swim, dear.
Hello, Sylvia.

-Feeling better?
-Feeling better?
I'm fine.
Good, good, good.
Where are you going?
I'm going to the tennis court.
-See you!
-Have a nice game, dear.
Sylvia's feeling better now.
She's playing tennis.
Playing tennis?
No, she isn't.
She's having a swim.
Hello, Mummy!
Hello, Daddy!
Bye!
SAM:
Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience.
Why don't you wait?
I'll get our coats.
Mm.
Okay?
Hope to see you again soon.
Thank you, Miss.
Oh, great.
I can't even read that check.
Well, I'm so sorry if my handwriting isn't up to your high and mighty standards, but some of us don't get to sit around on our buns all day and practice our penmanship.
Some of us have to go out and earn a living!
Here are your glasses, dear.
You left them in your coat again.
Oh, thanks.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Let's go.
Oh, hey, um...
I'm really sorry.
I-I...
I don't know what to say, except I had a really bad day.
Oh... yeah, sure, Carla, bad day.
Bad life is more like it.
House full of kids, this crummy job.
If I keep treatin' my customers this way,
I'm going to lose even that.
Uh, uh, here you go.
I hope things'll start looking up.
Oh, no, no, no, no, I couldn't, I couldn't.
Not the way I treated you.
No, please, please, please, we insist.
(sighs)
Ten bucks?
Excuse me, Miss.
You forgot to, uh, give me a napkin.
I'm so sorry!
I don't know what to say, except I've had a really bad day.
Bad day?
Bad life is more like it.
A house full of kids... (piano plays)
?
Making your way in the world today ?
?
Takes everything you've got ?
?
Taking a break from all your worries ?
?
Sure would help a lot ?
?
Wouldn't you like to get away?
?
?
Sometimes you want to go ?
?
Where everybody knows your name ?
?
And they're always glad you came ?
?
You want to be where you can see ?
?
Our troubles are all the same ?
?
You want to be where everybody knows your name ?
?
You want to go where people know ?
?
People are all the same ?
?
You want to go where everybody knows your name. ?
Yep!
Hey, everybody, guess what?
Today marks the beginning of my seventh year as a U.S. postal carrier.
Well, all right.
Woody, I think that calls for a little drink on the house.
What do you think, huh?
I think you're right, Mr. Peterson.
Yeah?
Hey, what the hell, give Cliffie one, too.
Hey...
This guy, huh?
Oh, yeah, imagine that.
Seven years carrying the old bag around.
(snorts)
Yeah, I know the feeling.
That's, uh... that's quite an achievement, though, Cliffie.
Oh, yeah?
Look who's talkin'.
Oh, okay, all right.
I know some people around here don't exactly think that I'm an overachiever, but, uh...
I'll tell you,
I don't plan to go to my grave until I've made some sort of impression on this world.
I'd say you've already made a deep one.
You know,
I plan on leavin' somethin' behind for the world to remember me by.
Yeah?
And here it is.
(sighs)
It's a glass of Windex, Woody.
No, it's a drink.
And Woody Boyd is going to become the next Jim Sheehan.
Who?
Certainly you've heard of the inventor of the Fish House Punch?
I can't say we have,
Wood, but then again, we don't get out that much, you know?
Well, I'm callin' mine the Blue Boyd of Happiness.
Can I tempt you?
Not bad.
Really.
Oh, hey, that's delicious.
Now all I got to do is fill out these forms and register with Bartender's Monthly Magazine, and my name will be a household word.
Yeah: doorknob.
Hey, Sam, you want to try my new drink?
Woody, I can't touch that stuff.
I'm an alcoholic.
You are?
Oh, I...
I'm sorry.
I-I thought you knew.
Yeah, I drank myself out of baseball and out of a marriage.
Gee, that's hard to believe.
Well, it's true.
Right, gang?
Yeah...
Guy had a face full of booze...
No, no, no, I believe you were a drunk, Sam.
I just didn't know you'd been married.
Mmm, pretty good Blue Moon.
You mean it's already a drink?
Aw, don't feel disappointed there, Woody.
Every combination in the world's been done to death by now.
You couldn't possibly invent anything new.
(phone rings)
DIANE:
Hello, Cheers.
Hey, Woody, gin and tonic.
Oh, uh, somebody's already invented that.
No, you horseshoe, I'm ordering one.
Oh, no!
Really?
Tonight?
Oh!
Oh, I can't wait!
Yes, thank you.
Oh!
I have the most exciting news, everyone.
Tonight I am eating dinner at The Cafe.
Ah, gee, that's pretty exciting.
Tonight I'm driving home in The Car.
No, you see, um... actually, Sam,
The Cafe is one of the trendiest restaurants.
Eating there is considered, uh, to be rather a coup among certain, oh... self-important and pretentious circles.
Congratulations, Diane.
If this place is so hot, how come they can't think of a better name than The Cafe?
Oh, Carla, if you had any sense of style, you would know that a simple name connotes the very best of taste.
Hey, you're right about that, Diane.
There's this joint out on Route One called "Eat".
Don't miss it.
It's great.
Say, you know, Darlene and I can't make up our mind whether to have some chili or a hamburger.
Maybe this Cafe joint sounds just like the ticket.
Well, you got the number there?
(laughing)
What?
What's the number?
What?
Pardonne mon laughteur, Sam.
This is not the sort of place you just call and make a reservation.
My dinner companion is a Brundage, and even with that pull, he had to wait three months for a table.
Ooh, geez, I wonder how long he had to wait for the chairs.
Look what I'm dealing with.
You consider food as a fuel to be salted down heavily, covered with ketchup, stuffed in your mouth, and on a good day, chewed.
What I'm trying to say is, Sam, you couldn't possibly get a reservation at this late hour.
Diane, I can get a reservation in any restaurant I want.
The name "Sam Malone"
still carries a little clout in this town.
Right.
Hey, hey, hey.
Very well, Sam.
Let's give it a try.
Allow me to call The Cafe.
Well, now, li-lis...
I'm not even sure I want to go there.
Afraid, Sam?
They have not built the restaurant that can scare me.
Come on.
Um, yes, hold on, please.
Um, hello, uh, I'd like to make a reservation, please.
Nothing tonight?
Well, this happens to be Sam "Mayday" Malone, formerly of the Red Sox.
Well, yeah, that'll be fine.
8:00?
Well, let's say 8:00.
Thank you very much.
Hey, all right, Sammy.
You got it, huh?
Sure did.
When, next March?
No, next February.
Well done, Sam.
God, I hate it when she's right.
Ah, you didn't want to eat there anyway, Sam.
The waiters pride themselves on rudeness, the portions are too small, and it's exorbitantly overpriced.
Oh, you couldn't get in either, huh?
Not till April.
Well, I certainly hope Diane had a big lunch.
Hi, I'd like to, uh, cancel a reservation for tonight, please.
The name is Brundage.
Party of two.
Yes, that Brundage.
Thank you.
Uh-uh, uh-uh, Sammy.
Canceling Diane's reservation?
CLIFF:
Ooh, heart of stone.
I love it.
Yeah, hi, this is, uh, Sam Malone again.
I'm just wondering if you might've had a surprise cancellation for tonight.
What do you mean, you don't?
You must have.
I just...
No, no, n-never mind, never mind.
Boy, I'd sure love to waltz into that joint tonight just so I could see the look on her face.
Well, if it's that important to you, Sam, give me the phone.
If Julian Weinstein, my good friend, can't get you in, nobody can.
Ooh, the heart transplant wizard?
Oh, one and the same, yeah.
We went to prep school together.
He's a well-known gourmet.
Yeah, well, wh-why would he want to do this for me, though?
He'd love to do me a favor.
See, we dissected our first frog together.
Hello, Julian.
Julian, hi.
Frasier Crane.
How are you?
Crane.
C-R-A-N-E.
Yes, yes, Dr. Frasier Crane.
All right, fine.
Uh, listen, I was wondering what you know about, uh...
No, it's A-N-E!
Oh, skip it!
I'll tell you, you know, you open a few thoraxes, you forget who your friends are.
Oh, it's beautiful.
A feast for the eyes as well as the palate.
Ah, that must be our table.
Uh, the Brundage party.
Brundage?
Ah, Brundage.
You canceled.
(laughs)
That's impossible.
I-I made the reservations over three months ago.
Well, obviously, there's been some mistake.
The best we can do is give you the next available table.
And when might that be?
If all goes well, perhaps... tonight.
Perhaps?
Jordan, don't make a fuss, please.
We'll straighten this out.
He's sorry.
(laughs)
Dr. Weinstein, your table is ready.
Excuse me, Miss.
I don't believe it.
Oh, neither do I.
I was this close to Dr. Julian Weinstein.
That's not Julian Weinstein.
That's the man who stole our reservation.
That's not Julian Weinstein.
That's an imposter.
Ask him for his I.D.
Ask him to spell I.D.
Do you know how to order in a place like this?
Oh, yeah, yeah, my, uh, friend Frasier read a review about the menu.
He coached me.
No problem.
Dr. Weinstein.
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
You swine.
It's one thing to pretend to be somebody else on the phone, but convincing others that you're a sophisticated gourmet is a little bit more than you can handle.
You're going to blow it, Sam.
You're going to be embarrassed in front of some of the most important people in Boston.
And then you're going to slink out of here with your curly little swine tail between your legs.
You don't think I can handle this?
Well, just watch.
Excuse me, we'd like to start off with Bouchées Parmentier au Fromage, followed by a salade maison, and for our entrée, we'll have Tourte Froide D'Anguille Rabelais.
Thank you so much.
Good, Sam; that was your busboy.
I knew that.
He's got lips.
He can tell the waiter, can't he?
Bon appetit, Dr. Weinstein.
Who's Miss Grumpus?
Excuse me, uh, you aren't, uh, Dr. Julian Weinstein, are you?
Uh... yes.
(chuckles softly)
This is really an honor.
I'm, I'm Dr. Peter Fisher.
Oh.
Uh, nice to meet you.
Yeah.
You know, I had no idea you were so young.
Well, I, uh, skipped a few grades in med school.
(laughing)
You got to have a sense of humor in this line of work.
Say, if you'll indulge in a little shop talk, uh, where did you come up with that concept of combining antithymocyte globulin with, uh, cyclosporin A to combat tissue rejection?
On the beach.
(uncomfortable chuckle)
Nice meeting you.
Excuse me, Dr. Weinstein.
Oh, uh, yeah, here we go.
Our chef Claude would like to say hello.
He met you while he was a chef at La Ronde.
Do you mind?
Oh, uh... well, actu-actually...
It won't take but a moment.
Maybe, uh...
Grab your purse.
We've got to get...
Dr. Weinstein, so good...
You're not Dr. Weinstein.
Yes, I am.
Perhaps you hadn't heard about my accident.
Why, no, I didn't.
Oh, yes, yes, uh... terribly disfigured.
Uh, thank God for plastic surgery.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
But they've done a wonderful job.
Hmm...
You look much better.
And taller.
Traction.
It, uh...
Well, nice to see you again.
You, too.
Boy, you pulled it off.
Mm.
That's pretty smart.
Yeah, well, of course I'm smart.
I'm a doctor.
(laughing):
Oh!
Right.
All right, whiskey, vermouth, bitters-- that's a Paddy Cocktail.
Gin, vermouth, grapefruit juice-- that's a Palm Beach.
Oh, wait a minute.
How about gin, vermouth and black coffee?
That's paint remover.
All right, I'll try something else.
Oh, great, I'm out of limes.
Don't panic.
Sam always keeps some extras around.
Where?
Call the doctor and find out.
Telephone for Dr. Weinstein.
Oh, um...
It's a Dr. Woody.
He's in the middle of surgery, and he says he needs your opinion.
Thank you.
Hello?
Wha-what?
You're out of them?
No, look, just, just check in the box right next to the scotch uh, tape.
The scotch tape.
We, uh...
Sometimes we run out of stitches and have to improvise.
Thank you, Dr. Woody.
Dr. Weinstein?
My date needs medical attention.
Can you help?
My food just arrived.
Well, I'm a doctor.
Sit down.
I-I want the world-famous heart surgeon,
Dr. Julian Weinstein.
Well, of course;
I bow to his greater skill.
No, no, no, uh, why don't you go ahead there, Fisher, and give him a shot?
He's having chest pains, Doctor!
Oh, well, uh, why don't you time them and see how far apart they are?
All right, I'll, uh, give him a look-see, I guess.
Right this way, Doctor.
Everything'll be all right.
Don't worry.
What are you doing?
You're ruining my dinner.
Ruining your dinner?
Everybody, now...
Sam, this is the cruelest thing you've ever done!
Yeah, what about the crummy thing you did to me earlier today, making me feel like a big nobody?
I apologize.
I spoke irrationally.
You're not a nobody.
(sighs)
Now, will you and your date kindly leave so that Jordan and I can have our rightful meal, and the two of you can sashay over to the Colonel's across the street?
Will you excuse me?
My meal is getting cold.
Now...
Well, we may have a long wait ahead of us, but we are going to stay until we get seated.
No, you're going to stay until you get seated.
Right about now a bucket of extra crispy doesn't sound half bad.
Okay, Dr. Crane, just drink up.
Woody, please, you promised you'd stop after the rum and trail mix.
That wasn't a drink.
That was just something to cleanse your palate.
Now come on, here.
My God, Woody!
That bad, huh?
No, no, it's terrific.
Here, try this.
I've never had anything like it.
All right!
Oh!
Oh, yeah!
This one gets you in the cocktail hall of fame!
So, what's in it, Wood?
Yeah, what's the secret recipe?
Well, it's, uh, two parts...
(crying)
Your change, Dr. Weinstein.
Ah, thank you very much.
Whew, boy, remember the good old days when you could spend $200 for a meal and then still have enough change to buy a mint patty?
Ah, Paul, memorable.
Aw, gee... (cries out)
Madam, we've had our last seating.
I'm afraid we won't be able to accommodate you this evening.
Oh, Paul, uh... could I speak to you for a minute?
I'll meet you outside.
Listen, it, it would be a great personal favor to me,
Dr. Julian Weinstein-- in fact, to the entire Weinstein family, and pretty much to doctors all over the world-- if... if you could, uh, make sure she gets some food.
Well, uh, if you'll agree to honor us with your presence again, Dr. Weinstein,
I'll see to it personally.
SAM:
Well, I appreciate that.
Enjoy, Diane.
Thank you.
I intend to.
Thank you.
This will do nicely.
Would you like to hear our menu?
Thank you, no.
I've memorized it.
I'll have the Tournedos Rossini.
I'm sorry, we're all out of that.
Uh, then I'll have the Jambon Farci et Braise.
Once again, I'm sorry.
Let's attack this from another direction.
You tell me what you have left.
Fricadelles de veau a la Nicoise.
Great, I'm in a Fricadelle mood.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm still hungry, actually.
What happened to, uh, Darlene?
Oh, I put her in a cab and sent her home.
Well, you don't have to do me any favors.
No, I'm not doing you any favors.
I-I'm really hungry.
May I, uh, join you?
I don't care what you do.
Well, thank you.
Thank you, Sam.
You're welcome.
Doctor.
Ah, Paul.
Can I get you anything else?
Uh, what do you have?
Anything for you, Dr. Weinstein.
Ah, well...
You know, I just can't make up my mind.
Why don't you have my dear friend Claude mix me up something special?
Very good.
(chuckling)
I really do appreciate your coming back, Sam.
It was sweet.
No, no, it's not sweet.
I...
I did it for myself.
I was feeling guilty out there, and I don't like to feel guilty.
Well, that's sweet in itself.
Well, we'll see how sweet you think it is when I have you pay for your own meal.
Madam.
Doctor.
Everything was delightful and well worth the wait.
Ooh, yes, I enjoyed it very much.
I'll be right with you.
Say, uh, I seem to be running a little short on cash.
You know, Sam, I think it was a really good idea you had about us going Dutch.
See, this way, we don't feel that we owe each other anything.
This is not funny.
This could be very embarrassing for both of us.
Please.
Why?
I've already paid for my meal, and I'm leaving.
Good night, Dr. Weinstein.
See you in surgery.
Hey, I'm serious.
Hey, come on, don't do this!
MAITRE D':
Is there a problem, Doctor?
No, no, no problem at all.
Um...
I'll just use my credit card here.
Mm, very well.
Uh, Dr. Weinstein, this appears to be the credit card of a Mr. Sam Malone.
Let me see that.
Well, I'll be darned.
You know, I must have, uh, switched wallets with this Malone character.
You know, I bet it happened at the club.
Yes, it did;
I remember him now.
A baseball player.
Malone.
You, uh, you ever heard of him?
No.
Oh, well, why don't you, uh, put it on this credit card anyway, and I'll take this Malone guy out to dinner some other time, hmm?
I'm afraid not.
Well, all right, I don't suppose you take a personal check, do you?
And whose name would be on that?
Okay, well, uh, why don't we try this, then?
Oh, my God, look at the size of that cat!
Hey, you, come back here!
Shooting stars?
Dr. Hirose called me out here.
I wonder if this is related to that...
Justs as I thought, GT medicine.
Its color is affected by shooting stars.
You, you want me to give you this?
The GT medicine is still incomplete.
I just can't hand it over.
BIOTHERAPY
Dr. Hirose is running late huh?
- He was at his vacation house last night. -
Ah, his pattern of studying till late at night.
If you wake him up he's going to be grumpy.
Yeah, you're right.
REPORT ON GT MEDICINE
This data...
When was this put here?
Look.
Data on the GT medicine?
I want to see this.
- Yeah. -
Who are you?
Who used the GT medicine without permission?
You?
- No, not me. -
Did you Miada?
No.
I didn't either.
I'm the one who did it.
It was you Date?
Why did you use the GT medicine without permission?
You should set an example since you're in charge.
Doing that is going to cause problems.
Doctor.
We have a misunderstanding here.
Misunderstanding?
GT medicine is... my development or have or have you forgotten that?
My research has companies that want to finance it.
Those companies wanted to see the affect of this so I wanted to show them.
The GT medicine... can have big side effects...
Unless those problems are solved... it can't be shown to the public.
This research... we have to continue it with great care.
I have one question for you.
you made me stop the research but... you're going to continue to research GT medicine on your own, right?
You took my research from me.
That's absurd.
I look down on you with disgust.
We are not teacher and student anymore.
Get out of here.
Those companies want my research badly.
There are a lot of companies that give me unlimited funds.
Excuse me.
Maida...
What are you going to do?
Are you going to come with me?
I'm not forcing you.
If you want to come with me you can.
Cheif, wait please.
In GT medicine liquid, animals grow ten time faster then normal
Doctor.
I wonder why he is so negative towards this amazing research?
Seems like the powr went out.
Ms. Tachibana!
Mayumi...
That's a serious prank to pull.
Mayumi!
Wait up!
Hey wait!
Come back!
Don't get so upset.
I'm sorry OK, please?
Please don't be so upset.
No.
I can't forgive you.
We had a date yesterday and you ditched me so I couldn't sleep.
Because of that I had to skip school today.
It's all your fault.
You're blaming me for to many things.
It's fine to blame you for all that.
I can say that today.
I want to be selfish.
OK I understand.
See I'm apologizing.
Forgive me.
No.
Hello, Dr. Hirose's research office.
Ah, Mr. Maeda.
Where are you right now?
Yes.
What!
Dr. Hirose has been murdered?
Hello?
Hello are you there?
Ms. Shiozawa?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Ms. Shiozawa?
Where is the GT medicine?
WHERE IS THE GT MEDICINE?
!
WHERE IS THE GT MEDICINE?
!
WHERE IS THE GT MEDICINE?
!
I don't know.
The GT medicine is something we need by any means!
Give it to me!
There is no substance on our planet that would create GT medicine.
So I want the actual GT medicine!
I don't know.
I don't know where it is.
Well, I'll make you remember...
So you still can't remember?
!
That's the lab!
Thank you for your help.
You can go.
Mr. Kanabara I still have some questions I want to ask.
I'll head home as soon as we are done.
So wait at the apartment.
OK.
Hurry home please.
Now Mr. Kanabara.
- Yes. -
Be quiet and relax.
You're Ms. Tachibana right?
I'm Mr. Maeda.
We meet several times at Dr. Hirose's lab.
Did you know Ms. Shiozawa was killd?
Ms. Shiozawa too?
What do you mean Ms. Shiozawa too?
Dr. Hirose was killed.
Last night, Dr. Date was called and when he went to his house... he said Dr. Hirose was killed.
Actually I need a favor.
According to Dr. Date Dr. Hirose must have... tired to tell him about his new discovery of GT medicine.
The doctor is very methodical.
He must have left his research there.
Today I'm going to meet up with Dr. Date.
My favor is this, until then...
Look for the last research Dr. Hirose left.
I don`t think I...
Because we left the research group... we are unable to come and go freely.
There is no other way except to ask you.
Please!
Please help.
Please!
What are you doing?
It`s the detective!
Stop now!
- I'm begging you!
-
Stop!
I said stop!
It`s terrible!
Mayumi!
- When is this going to stop!
-
Please calm down.
you have to calm down.
Be strong.
This is pretty scary...
Then wait here.
I'll go look myself.
Are you really going?
If we don't go Dr. Hirose would have died for nothing.
We need to get the research he left.
As a scientist and all...
OK, I'll go too.
We have to hurry up and search.
Not this one.
Not this one either.
Not this one.
This isn't it either.
As I thought it's not here.
Must be at Dr. Hirose's vacation house.
The GT medicine...
Give me the GT medicine.
It's you the killer from earlier.
Mayumi!
Run!
Mayumi!
Stop right there!
Put your hands down or we'll shot!
Stop moving!
Take that!
Monster!
Mayumi!
Hurry and get in!
I was supposed to meet Maeda, but he didn't show.
I was wondering why so I went to the lab.
Mr. Maeda
He was killed.
What?
I think it was that monster that did it.
That monster... wants the GT medicine.
GT medicine?
You sure?
Dr. Hirose and Ms. Shiozawa have been killed.
For what reason?
Why is that monster after the GT medicine?
I don't know.
I truly have no idea.
- Please tell us. -
Why was it that Dr. Hirose... removed you as cheif of research?
Because of the GT medicine's side effects.
If GT medicine enters water in large amounts... it's predicted that 99% of the plankton... will become completly extinct.
That means if plankton becomes extinct... the oceans components will change, and if they change what do you think will happen to the animals... that are the planet now?
It's been said that the ocean is the orgin of life...
If those componets change... then all life will die.
No... not just the ocean's...
If you try to make the plant's grow faster with it... what do you think will happen if it is spread on the ground?
The world...
The world will change.
If the components change...
A new world will begin with new componets.
That's the devil's research!
The development of GT medicine is an awful thing!
Say whatever you want...
Whether it's good or bad the results will decide.
Even if the process is bad if the results are good, then it's good.
It's almost finished...
The research is steadily progressing...
I want...
I want the research documents that Dr. Hirose left behind.
His tone over the phone last night...
Dr. Hirose... he most have found something important.
This must be it.
I found it.
Mr. Kanabara
Who or what the hell are you?
Why do you want the GT medicine?
I've come from the far future... a future unimaginable by humans.
I've come here by light.
By light!
?
That light was a time machine?
That's right.
My people are the second race of earthlings.
The inferior humans... were unable to clean the pollution caused by their development.
Unable to recover from their destroyed environment.
In 500 years... they all died off along with everything.
After that began our new Genesis.
The alien bacteria brought by shooting stars were our ancestors.
So like the creatures on earth began from plankton the second generation... evolved from bacteria from space?
From a time capsule buried deep underground... we discovered GT medicine.
What was written in the time capsule?
Was GT medicine completed?
One month from now it will be complete.
As GT medicine "Two".
The creators Hirose Osamu and Date Keisuke
It was written that it was god's creation that saved them from famine many times.
Give me the GT medicine.
I will change the ocean's wit the GT medicine and make all creatures extinct.
So we can start our generation even earlier.
Where do you store the GT medicine?
The place we store our GT medicine?
Is that how it is?
If I know where it is I will nothing to do with you fools.
I'm going to tell you why I chose now to show up.
To get my hands on GT medicine... at the same time kill the creators of it and... to stop them from making GT "Two".
Now was the perfect time.
You're to late.
I'm saying you're to late you fool.
DIE!
STOP IT!
STOP IT!
Mr...
Mr. Kanabara...
Mr. Date!
Mr. Date!
Did you see?
The moment of GT "Two"... that it destroyed that person... from the future's cells...
Mr. Date!
Did you say GT medicine "Two"?
GT medicine is underneath my study...
Destroy it...
The GT medicne "Two" research... is on the floppy disk in my study...
GT medicine "Two" was... completed...
Mr. Date!
Mr. Date!
Stay awake!
Mr. Date!
It's a dream...
Everyting is a dream.
Such terrible things only come from dreams.
It's not a dream.
It's reality.
Dr. Hirose, Mr. Date...
Mr. Maeda, Ms. Shiozawa...
They're all dead.
And now...
And now?
Only GT medicine is left...
Mayumi...
I'm gonna do it!
Based on Dr. Date's research...
I'll finish GT "Two".
And annouce it in their names!
The GT medicine... we will use it for a world of peace.

YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS.
THE CITY'S MAKING US PUT IN A WATER METER.
THERE WILL BE FEWER PARKING SPACES.
THE SCHOOLS WILL BE MORE CROWDED.

I THINK I'LL SIT DOWN HERE AT THE END OF THE BED.
AS A MATTER OF FACT
I THINK I'LL SIT ON THE MIDDLE OF THE BED
AND JUST...
PETER!
HI, PETER.
HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING?
PETER DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO THE DENTIST.
OH, PETER.
IT'S NO PROBLEM GOING TO THE DENTIST.
WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO GO?
OKAY.
BUT I TELL YOU
DR. BURNS IS GREAT, ISN'T HE?
DR. BURNS IS NICE, PETER.
YEAH.
SOMETIMES WHEN I COME FROM DR. BURNS'
I CAN TALK FUNNY.
SOMETIMES MY LIP
IS A LITTLE TINGLY
AND PEOPLE SAY, "HOW ARE YOU DOING?"
AND I SAY:
( GARBLED ) "I'M OKAY."
YEAH.
SOMETIMES WHEN MY WIFE IS TALKING TO ME
SHE SAYS, "WELL, HOW ARE YOU FEELING?"
I SAY:
( GARBLED ) "I'M OKAY."
SHE SAID, "DID THE DENTIST HURT?"
AND I SAY:
( GARBLED ) "OH, NO, THE DENTIST DIDN'T HURT ME AT ALL."
( SPEAKING AS IF LIPS ARE NUMB )
"AND IT WAS ALL RIGHTY."
ALL RIGHTY?
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

O-B-KAY-B?
O-B-KAY-B.
O-B-KAY-B?
O-B-KAY-B.
O-B-KAY-B.
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
LET'S GO SEE DR. BURNS!
NOW, PETER, I WOULD NEVER GO TO ANYBODY BUT DR. BURNS.
DON'T WORRY.
HE'S A GREAT DENTIST.
RIGHT, RUDY?
RIGHT.
I'VE BEEN GOING SINCE I WAS YOUR AGE.
ME, TOO.
( DOORBELL )
I'LL GET IT.
THAT MUST BE PETER'S FATHER.
MR. CHIARA, HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
HI.
WE GOT HIM FOR YOU.
BYE, PETER.
GOOD LUCK AT THE DENTIST.
COME ON, PETE.
EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT, KID.
BYE-BYE.
WILL YOU FEEL BETTER IF I COME?
CAN I, DADDY?
IT'S UP TO MR. CHIARA.
OKAY.
YOU'VE GOT A BUDDY TO GO WITH YOU NOW.
WE'RE BRAVE TOGETHER.
HAVING FUN.
LOOK OUT, DR. BURNS!
TAKE HIM TO THE EYE DOCTOR WHILE YOU'RE AT IT.
ISN'T THIS NICE?
I'LL GO TELL THEM WE'RE HERE.
HELLO?
AH, WHO SAID, "HELLO?"
ME.
OH, HELLO!
I KNOW YOU.
YOU'RE RUDY HUXTABLE.
RIGHT.
HOW ARE YOU?
FINE.
THAT'S NICE.
DO YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT?
NO, I'M HERE WITH MY FRIEND--
PETER.
WHICH ONE IS PETER?
THE LITTLE ONE OR THE BIG ONE?
THE LITTLE ONE.
THE LITTLE ONE.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
HE LOOKS SCARED.
HE ALWAYS LOOKS LIKE THAT.
I'LL BE OUT IN ONE SECOND.
PETER, I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE HIM.
HE'S BEEN A DENTIST FOR A LONG TIME.
HERE WE ARE.
THAT WASN'T SO BAD, WAS IT, JAMES?
YES.
SHHH!
I HAVE OTHER PATIENTS HERE
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE.
NOW YOU CAN PICK OUT A TOY, OKAY?
NO, NOT ALL OF THEM.
IF YOU COME IN FOR A WHOLE SET OF TEETH
YOU CAN HAVE THEM ALL.
NOW, YOU ONLY HAVE ONE.
THAT'S A NICE ONE.
THANK YOU, DOCTOR BURNS.
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.
WELL, TAKE HIM HOME
AND WASH HIS MOUTH OUT WITH SOAP.
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY
SO I THINK I'LL GET READY TO GO.
YOU CAN'T GO.
WHY NOT?
YOU'RE THE DENTIST.
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I AM THE DENTIST.
WELL, I BETTER BEHAVE LIKE ONE, HUH?
SO, YOU ARE PETER, YES?
AND YOU'RE HIS FATHER?
I CAN SEE WHY YOU ARE RELATED.
PETER, IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM
WITH YOUR TEETH
YOU COME AND SEE ME, YES?
HE DOES.
HE DOES WHAT?
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIS TEETH.
WHO?
PETER.
IS THAT TRUE, PETER?
HE WAS UP ALL NIGHT...
I DIDN'T ASK YOU.
I'M TALKING TO PETER.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME INSIDE WITH ME?
I'LL GO WITH YOU.
IS THAT ALL RIGHT WITH YOU?
IS THAT ALL RIGHT WITH YOU?
DON'T GO AWAY.
WE'LL BE OUT IN TWO OR THREE DAYS.
COME WITH ME.
HERE WE GO.
WE COME INSIDE
AND PETER, JUST HOP INTO THE CHAIR.
I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE.
HOP, HOP, HOP INTO THE CHAIR.
PETER, HOP, JUMP, CLIMB INTO THE CHAIR.
PETER...
JUMP IN THE CHAIR, PETER.
HE WON'T DO IT.
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
WE COULD PUSH HIM.
WHY DON'T WE TAKE HIM ON A TOUR?
COME HERE, MEET ME.
AND THEN WE START WITH THE LEFT FOOT.
HERE WE GO THROUGH THE OFFICE.
AND THE FIRST THING WE SHOW YOU HERE
IS MY DIPLOMA.
THIS IS MY DIPLOMA WHEN I GRADUATED
FROM DENTAL SCHOOL IN 1776.
SHOW HIM THE TEETH.
NO, THOSE TEETH.
WHICH ONES?
THE ONES ON THE SHELF?
THESE GO ON THE SHELF SOMETIMES, TOO, YOU KNOW?
HERE WE ARE.
SIT DOWN.
SHARE THAT PLACE.
AND WE HAVE THE TEETH.
AREN'T THESE NICE?
ALL RIGHT.
TELL HIM THE STORY.
OH, ALL RIGHT.
NOW, A LONG TIME AGO
THESE TEETH WALKED INTO MY OFFICE.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE AN APPOINTMENT--
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING.
AND I SAID, "DO I KNOW YOU?"
AND THEY SAID
"NO, BUT YOU'VE TAKEN OUT SOME OF OUR FRIENDS."
AND I SAID, "WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?"
AND THEY SAID
"WE WOULD LIKE TO COME TO WORK FOR YOU."
I SAID, "DO YOU KNOW HOW TO TYPE?"
THEY SAID, "NO."
I SAID, "HOW WILL YOU WORK FOR ME?"
THEY SAID, "WE WILL SIT ON THE SHELF
"SO PEOPLE CAN SEE
"WHAT GOOD, HEALTHY, STRONG TEETH
ARE SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE."
YOU SEE?
NOW THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO--
TWENTY, FORTY, SIXTY...
ALMOST FOUR YEARS AGO.
AND THEY HAVE NEVER MISSED A DAY'S WORK...
WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY FOR MY RECEPTIONIST.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL PUT THESE BACK.
AND WE'LL GO ON FROM HERE.
NOW, I HAVE ONE MORE THING TO SHOW YOU, PETER.
BECAUSE WE HAVE HERE AN EXPERIMENTAL TOOTH SHUTTLE.
AND WE HAVE AN INSTRUMENT WHICH MAKES IT GO WHOOO, UP
AND WE HAVE ANOTHER INSTRUMENT WHICH MAKES IT GO DOWN.
BUT WE NEED AN ASTRONAUT.
BE AN ASTRONAUT.
FIVE, FOUR, THREE...
THEY'RE WAITING FOR YOU ON THE MOON, PETER.
...THREE, TWO, ONE...
OH!
YAY, PETER!
BRAVO, THAT'S MARVELOUS.
PETER, IF YOU'LL OPEN YOUR MOUTH
I'LL SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.
JUST A LITTLE WIDER.
IT'S NOT HARD.
LIKE THIS-
- LOOK.
OH, I HAVE AN IDEA.
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR A SONG?
* OLD MCDONALD HAD A FARM *
* EE-I-EE-I-OH!
*
SEE?
IT'S EASY.
DO YOU WANT TO SING ALONG?
* OLD MCDONALD HAD A FARM *
* EE-I-EE-I... * * ...
OH!
*
HOW ABOUT RUDY SITTING HERE AND I'LL EXAMINE HER?
NO WAY!
COULD I SEE YOU IN MY OFFICE OVER HERE?
I THINK PETER IS AFRAID TO OPEN HIS MOUTH.
I THINK IF YOU SIT IN THE CHAIR AND SHOW HIM
YOU'RE BRAVE ENOUGH TO OPEN YOUR MOUTH
MAYBE HE'LL OPEN HIS.
UNDERSTAND?
YES.
YOU WON'T DO IT?
NO.
I'M IN THIS ALONE?
YES.
( CRYING )
DON'T CRY.
I'LL BE OKAY IN A MINUTE.
( WAILING )
MY WHOLE LIFE
I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH CHILDREN
AND MY REPUTATION NOW WILL BE SPOILED!
OKAY, I'LL OPEN MY MOUTH.
OHHH!
YOU SEE, IT WORKS EVERY TIME.
I'LL WASH MY HANDS AND WE'LL GET READY.
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING?
SCRAMBLED EGGS.
FOR DINNER?
I INVITED PETER TO EAT WITH US.
HIS MOUTH IS STILL A LITTLE SENSITIVE.
I'LL MAKE MYSELF A STEAK.
PETER WILL FEEL BADLY
IF YOU'RE EATING STEAK AND HE'S EATING SCRAMBLED EGGS.
I'LL COVER THE STEAK WITH THE EGGS.
DAD, THERE'S A WOMAN WHO HAS TO SEE YOU.
ABOUT WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT SHE'S PREGNANT.
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE?
THERE'S NO WOMAN IN HERE.
NO, ONLY ME.
AND YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT.
NOT NOW, NO.
HELLO, DR. BURNS.
HELLO, CLAIRE.
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.
RUDY LEFT THIS IN MY OFFICE
AND I THOUGHT I WOULD DROP IT BY ON THE WAY HOME.
YOU HAD A TOUGH PATIENT TODAY.
I'VE HAD TOUGHER.
I...
WHICH REMINDS ME
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN MY OFFICE LATELY.
I WAS JUST IN TO SEE YOU.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
MY RECORDS SHOW THAT IT'S BEEN EIGHT MONTHS.
YOU HAVE ME CONFUSED WITH MY SON.
YOUR SON WAS IN LAST WEEK.
SO HOW ABOUT MONDAY YOU COME TO SEE ME?
NO, NO...
MONDAY'S NO GOOD FOR ME.
TUESDAY?
TUESDAY'S TIGHTER THAN MONDAY.
AHA.
HOW LOOSE IS WEDNESDAY?
I DON'T THINK SO.
WEDNESDAY'S NO GOOD.
WOULD YOU CONSIDER FEEZELDAY?
FEEZELDAY WE TAKE THE CHILDREN TO SEE THE FEEZELS.
JA.
YOU HAVE THURSDAY AFTERNOON OFF.
THERE YOU ARE.
I WILL SEE YOU AT 4:00, THURSDAY AFTERNOON.
I'LL SEE YOU TO THE DOOR.
ALL RIGHT.
THURSDAY AFTERNOON I WILL SEE YOU AT 4:00.
OH, DOCTOR.
YES?
WILL YOU SHOW ME THE TEETH?
YES.
WILL YOU PUT ME ON THE TOOTH SHUTTLE?
YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE BIG FOR THAT
BUT...
YES.
BY THE WAY, CLIFF.
YES, SIR?
WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED...
JUST ONE TOY?
BUT I LET YOU KISS MY WIFE.
TWO TOYS?
CLIFF?
CLIFF?
HMM?
WHERE'S THE PAPER?
PAPER?
YES, TODAY'S NEWSPAPER.
TODAY'S PAPER?
AH, NO, I HAVEN'T SEEN IT, DEAR.
I SAW YOU WITH IT AT DINNER.
WHAT DINNER?
TONIGHT.
YOU'RE HIDING IT FROM ME.
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
SO I WON'T READ IN BED.
- HAND IT OVER.
- OH, STOP IT.
I'M GOING TO FIND IT.
GO AHEAD.
HA, HA, HA.
NOT THERE.
NOW STOP IT.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE PAPER'S GONE.
IT'S UNDER THE PILLOWS.
NO.
MOVE YOUR HEAD.
HIDING THE PAPER FROM YOUR WIFE!
THAT IS SO CHILDISH.
I DO THAT BECAUSE YOU GET IN THE BED
YOU READ SOMETHING
AND YOU GET EXCITED AND ANGRY ABOUT IT.
PROMISE ME
YOU WON'T GET ANGRY ABOUT ANYTHING.
I PROMISE YOU.
AND IF I DO
I'LL KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT.
GOOD!
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S WONDERFUL.
YOU JUST GET IN THERE.
KISS.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, DEAR.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET UPSET?
NO, I'M NOT.
OKAY.
YOU'LL SEE.
Listen...
The wind tells a story, one that took place a long time ago when Yggdrasil, the Tree of Life, stood in the centre of the world.
In Asgard, land of the gods of the Vikings.
Here lived the one-eyed Odin, king of the gods and the mighty Thor, god of thunder.
From all over Asgard, the gods would gather here, in Valhalla the greatest castle of all.
Here they received the worship of mortal men which gives strength and life to gods.
From Valhalla, Odin surveyed the three worlds and from here, he sent out his ravens.
To gather news from faraway lands.
Beyond the land of Utgard home of the race of trolls whom men called giants the lords of darkness and chaos...
Beyond Utgard was Midgard, land of humankind.
Home of proud Vikings and industrious farmers.
From time to time, the gods went to Midgard to visit their human worshippers.
Tjalfe, come inside!
There's a storm coming.
You'll get soaked, you silly boy!
Shoo!
Roskva!
Come back, both of you, or I'll send your father after you.
Greetings, good people.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Loki, the magnificent.
This gentleman is Thor, the god of thunder, the roisterous...
That'll do.
We're staying here tonight.
- We haven't much food to offer...
- Don't worry.
- I'll kill one of my goats.
- We could make a...
But isn't that unfair on the poor goat?
Don't worry.
He's used to it.
Are you really the mighty Thor?
Yes.
Why are you sulking, Roskva?
He can't just kill the goat like that.
Of course he can.
He's a god.
He protects us from sorcery and giants.
He is a mighty warrior.
He is strong.
Take this, and that, you monster!
And now, the final blow!
So you give up, huh?
Victory is mine!
Tjalfe, the mighty cow slayer.
You wait and see.
Children, come in here.
The meat is tender.
Remember:
Eat as much as you like but don't break the bones.
Throw them onto the skin afterwards.
Tomorrow, when I spin my hammer above them the skin and bones will come to life again.
Here's a great story.
Once I was out fishing, I caught a gigantic fish.
Unfortunately, it got away.
But it wasn't my fault.
Me and Hymer the giant went out on the vast sea that surrounds the world to catch the Midgard Serpent.
For hook I used an anchor, and as bait an ox head.
...just when I was about to land it.
Hymer, that big, fat coward.
The Midgard Serpent got away, of course.
I should have known better than to go fishing with a giant.
Bunch of sissies, giants...
Tell me, Tjalfe, don't you like bone marrow?
I love it!
- Why don't you have a taste, then?
- Thor said...
There are so many bones.
Who is going to notice just one?
But perhaps you are afraid?
- Thunder.
- And tears forming.
What's this?
Get out here immediately!
Now!
Look at that.
Which one of you did it?
- Er...
I think it was me.
- You?
Come here!
- But he said that...
- Come now, Thor.
- Boys will be boys.
- Nonsense!
Let's say that as punishment for harming the goat, he'll come with us and be your servant.
He looks like a strong lad.
- Well, I don't know...
- Good.
That's settled then.
Today is your lucky day, young man.
It is a rare privilege to become servant to the god of thunder.
Congratulations, my dear friends.
What an opportunity for a young man.
Servant to the thunder god...
- Will he be all right?
- Of course he will.
He's tough.
What an honour!
You must be so proud of him.
He is to live in Asgard with the mighty god of thunder.
Now, let's have some breakfast.
- Where are you going, Tjalfe?
- To Asgard, to be Thor's servant.
- Will you get to fly in the wagon?
- I suppose so.
- But aren't you afraid?
- At least I won't have to chop wood.
I get to see the world and go on adventures and fish for serpents.
- Can I come too, Tjalfe?
- No, it's not for kids.
Run along now.
Thor only wants men...
Roskva...
I'll be leaving soon, so I just wanted to say...
- It ought to be around here.
- What?
The rainbow, young man.
Ah, there it is.
Come along, Tjalfe.
Pretty, isn't it?
Now, come along, boy.
- It won't break, will it?
- Of course not!
- I built it myself.
- Of course.
And so Roskva and Tjalfe came to Asgard.
Asgard, the land of wonders.
The land of the gods.
To Yggdrasil, the Tree of Life.
To Valhalla.
And to Bilskirnir, Thor's home.
Tjalfe!
Roskva!
Come and help me with the children.
Adventure...
Tjalfe, hurry up.
She's waiting for us.
Tjalfe!
Roskva!
Work, work, work.
Why do we have to do everything?
Thor is always out rumbling and having fun, and Loki is never here.
Well, you know Loki.
For the last time:
Get me out of here, you little, miserable...
Pull me up immediately, or it's straight back to the giants for you!
Quark, my little friend...
Please help Uncle Loki out of here.
Good boy.
Damned brat!
You're disgusting.
An embarrassment to your family!
Help!
Can anyone hear me?
Help!
They're crying because they're teething, right, Sif?
I don't remember when I was teething, but I'll bet it hurts a lot.
Sif, he's wet again.
Hello, everybody.
Sif.
- Having fun, boy?
- Well, I...
What a day.
Tjalfe!
Some mead.
Come to Daddy.
Thanks, son.
I might take you out hunting trolls one day.
Roskva, Thor said he might take me hunting.
Sif, they're crying.
So I hear.
They are teething.
You know that.
- Can't you do something?
- Yes, my love.
There.
Let's eat.
- Hello, my dear friends.
- Loki...
In time for dinner, as usual.
- What is that?
- I Don't know.
He followed me home.
I met some extraordinary people.
- Trolls and giants, I suppose.
- I leaned some amazing tricks.
- It's pure magic.
- Magic?
- Have you been at Utgardsloki's?
- I simply must show you this.
- Loki, control your little friend.
- Yes, yes.
Now...
I take an apple, a few rose leaves, and abracadabra...
A beautiful, bright, beguiling, breathtaking bat?
You little brat!
Go stand in the corner where you can't do any harm.
If you're so good at magic, then make him disappear.
Unfortunately, the spells don't last, Thor.
What's he doing now?
- There, there...
- Oh, children will be children.
- Loki, who is he?
- His name is Quark, I think.
I needed a bat for the next trick anyway.
You'll love this.
- From now on...
- Please!
No more trouble!
Roskva, Tjalfe.
Gather round.
This is really exciting.
We need two pebbles and the eyelash of a serpent.
Mix them all together.
A little water, and a sprinkling of mistletoe.
Loki!
The little beast is torturing my children!
- How long is that brat staying?
- Until he's learned some manners.
Well, I can't wait for that.
We're leaving now.
Goodbye!
That does it!
Let me have that little monster.
Calm down, Thor.
Sif will be back.
Sif will be livid.
If you want to make thunder, go outside.
I'll clean up in here.
Off you go.
Dear me, what a mess.
Poor things.
I wish I could help, but I have things to do.
I'll be in my room.
Out!
- What's he doing here?
- Never mind him.
We're busy.
I could sure use some breakfast.
Where is everything?
Never mind.
I didn't need that plate anyway.
Good morning, dear children.
You're up early.
What?
Oh, no!
I noticed you hadn't quite finished.
But I'm sure you will.
- You made the mess!
- You clean it up.
You seem to forget something.
I'm the god, you're the servants.
- Now, start sweeping!
- No!
- You'll do as I say.
- You can't tell us what to do.
- This isn't your house.
- We'll see about that.
Him again?
Just wait until Thor hears about this.
He won't listen to us.
Odin!
King of the gods.
- What about him?
- Well, he's king of the gods.
He should be able to help us if only we could get to him.
King of the gods?
We'll just get into more trouble.
- We had better wait for Thor.
- You wait then.
I'm leaving.
Long way down, isn't it?
We have to wait for Thor.
We don't even know this Odin.
He definitely won't listen to you.
You're just a little girl.
What are you doing?
Escaping.
We don't care, do we?
- Out of the shadows they came.
- Look!
Maybe they know the way.
At you service we are.
Definitely.
- Well, do you know the way?
- Are you looking for Odin?
We want to ask him to do us a favour.
- Strange creatures from beyond.
- The boundaries of time.
Of time.
No.
I think you've got it wrong.
We want to...
The king watches over his men.
The head is in trouble if he beats One-Eye.
- We just want to speak to...
- Come along then.
Come along.
Come, Quark.
I hope they take us to Odin.
That head is really creepy.
Why hasn't it got a body?
Boo!
Boo!
Stupid that was.
Didn't move.
I beg your pardon.
We have a small problem, and I was hoping you could help.
We've been terribly mistreated, and we've come a long way...
- Hey, I'm talking to you!
- What are you worms doing here?
Odin wants to be left alone.
Get out of here, or I'll...
How did you get past me?
Nobody is allowed to disturb Odin!
Will you get outta here...
You little...
I'll get you.
Silence!
Look what I've done.
Rolf, you may leave.
How dare you disturb the king of the gods?
Speak, child.
Well, sir...
Like I was saying we're being terribly mistreated by some people... er, gods, I mean.
My brother and I, and Quark here, we did everything we were told to.
I don't mind working, and I like Thor and Sif.
But Loki never helps...
Get away from the board, you little worm.
Leave that piece alone.
What are you two worms doing here in the sacred hall of the gods?
I'm dizzy!
Well, what happened?
They kicked us out.
You could have helped.
Of course.
Then I would have been kicked out too.
I told you Odin wouldn't listen to you and that little creep.
Why are you always so mean to him?
- I'm hungry.
- Serves you right.
- I'm cold.
- Tough.
- I can't wait to get home.
- Well, they won't be glad to see him.
- Why do you always pick on him?
- Because everything is his fault.
- That does it.
Goodbye.
- Good riddance.
Oh, Quark!
Good day, young man.
Greetings, human.
Only you will see clearly when the red one falls.
- And the thunder stills.
- And creation crumbles.
- Rumbles.
- Crumbles.
Just trust your eyes.
And hold on to your belief, human.
All beings need one another, need each other.
Someone needs you.
Needs you!
Roskva, I've been thinking.
I mean...
We could stay here.
Why not?
We could build a tree house and live in the woods.
Follow me, kids!
Hooray for Quark!
You know what, Quark?
You're all right.
So there you are.
You two are coming home, now!
No, not you.
You've caused enough trouble.
That does it!
He's going back to the giants!
- No, you can't do that.
- Why not?
- Because I...
- Go on.
Well, the giants...
Utgardsloki, you know...
We had a few drinks and I bet I could teach him to behave...
Quark, I mean.
And now I'm stuck with him.
- I'm taking him back.
- Yes.
Do that.
And you're coming with us.
- Utgard.
- Land of giants.
- Giants, beware!
- Thunder approaches!
- To Utgardsloki!
- Cheers!
Cheers!
Bottoms up!
Think I'm an airstrip, do you?
Cheers, you ugly creep!
Here comes dessert.
Remember Quark?
I call dibs on the offal.
Oh, little Quark...
That little monster.
I'd sure like to see Thor and his friends now.
I'll bet they have their hands full.
Has it occurred to you that they might send him back?
Well, if it isn't Thor and his friends.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm called Skrymer, and your cave is my glove.
What brings you to...
Ouch!
- I believe this is yours.
- Not for long.
That little monster is going back to where he belongs.
To Utgardsloki, I presume?
Right.
And when I see him...
You and Utgardsloki don't seem to be the best of buddies.
Well, I must go.
Good luck.
They fell for it.
They're bringing Quark back.
Now for some magic.
You'll receive our visitors.
Open up!
What a surprise.
My friend Thor.
What brings you here?
This.
Put your nose out of joint, did he?
He's all yours now.
Goodbye.
You want to fight, do you?
The same old Thor.
We thought we'd seen the last of you in these parts.
Rumour has is that you're having trouble with your new little friend.
I guess it's partly my fault.
Anyone can see that Thor doesn't have the spark of his brighter days.
Given the size of the problem...
Let's not quarrel over such a small matter.
Let's have a series of contests.
Whoever wins is relieved of the little rat.
Or are you afraid of losing?
Afraid?
You're talking to the great god of thunder!
I can handle any giant.
Excuse me, may I propose an eating contest?
For the gods...
Loki!
And for the giants...
Logi!
He who reaches the string first, wins.
My dear trolls and giants, may the best stomach...
Begin.
Loki, Loki, Loki...!
Not bad.
What about you, young lady?
No, not me.
I'm not good at anything.
- And you, young man?
- Oh no, I...
Come on.
You're not afraid of a little contest, are you?
Well, yes and no.
I...
A race, yes.
A race.
And I've decided who should oppose you.
On your marks...
Ready...
Get set...
Go!
He's so stupid.
I've already won.
Enough is enough.
Now it's my turn.
Sure, sure it is.
If you are my equal you can empty my horn in one draught.
Sure I can!
Fair is fair, old friend.
I'll give you another try.
See if you can lift my cat off the floor.
- My patience is running out!
- Come on, humour me.
Stop!
Yes, we don't want any harm to come to you, old friend.
That's just like you.
To stop when I was winning!
Enough!
I've had enough of your games.
I'm not leaving until one of you meets me in a wrestling match.
Oops...
- I need to talk to you.
- What?
Later.
Fight me, Thor.
What?
An old woman?
- You must be joking.
- Elli is my mother, Thor.
- She is stronger than you think.
- I don't fight old women.
How about a dance, my dear lady?
Good day, young man.
- Remember.
Only you...
...will see clearly.
- Someone needs you.
- Trust your eyes.
Thor!
Thor, the old woman...
She is...
Thor!
Aren't you gonna do something?
Take this!
And that, you monster!
And that!
Can't you see?
He's dying!
His face...
No!
It's not true.
No.
He's only sleeping.
Thor!
Wake up!
Gods can't die.
Only you will see clearly when the red one falls and the thunder stills.
I must believe, I must believe.
What happened?
She's a tough old lady.
What are you looking at?
All right, so she won.
What of it?
What is going on?
Shut up!
Well, my friend.
You can't win them all.
So Quark stays with you.
Right?
Come on, let's party.
Music!
Come on, let's all party!
Victory is ours victory is ours the gods are pitiful, the gods are pitiful, the gods are pitiful
you're staying with us you're staying with us forever
Here you go.
- Remarkable old woman.
- Yes, very puzzling.
- I think they've been having us on.
- I tried to tell you, Loki.
- Be quiet.
I'm thinking.
- It was magic.
I'm quite sure they used magic.
- I'm sorry I lost, boy.
- But you didn't lose.
- I saw it in the mirror.
- Interesting.
It wasn't a cat at all.
It was the Midgard Serpent.
And you didn't lose either, Loki.
Look at the trough.
It's burnt.
- The old woman beat me, though.
- Of course!
Thor, she was Age.
Nobody can fight that.
Not even you.
I'll show those scoundrels!
Just a moment.
We don't want any more broken bones, do we?
- I will handle this.
- You?
Yes, me.
Now, listen closely...
Children, go play.
And then...
This will do.
Good morning, my dear friends.
What a beautiful day.
I hope you enjoyed your stay.
- Too bad you have to keep Quark.
- Oh, we'll survive.
- Won't we, Thor?
- We sure will, Loki.
Have a safe journey.
Come back soon.
And by the way, my friends -
- I wasn't my usual honest self with you.
Those contests...
- Simple magic.
- Simple.
Things aren't always what they seem, are they?
Like this little creature here.
Unfortunately, the spell doesn't last.
- What have you done to him?
- Absolutely nothing.
The real Quark is...
I locked him up, but as long as we got through the gates without him...
- It's a chicken.
- I know that, dummy.
You got me, you old goat.
I'll keep the little brat.
There is so much to tell.
That place was simply filthy.
They're so ugly and cunning, they even had me fooled.
But once I realised what was going on well, I duped them.
By the way, what's for dinner?
- Boy...
- Yes, Thor?
- For you.
- For me?
A real sword!
Thank you.
Remember, son.
A true warrior knows when not to use it.

But isn't that unfair on the poor goat?
Don't worry.

Yes.

He can't just kill the goat like that.
Of course he can.

He is a mighty warrior.
He is strong.
you monster!
the final blow!
huh?
Victory is mine!
the mighty cow slayer.
You wait and see.
come in here.
The meat is tender.
Remember:
Eat as much as you like but don't break the bones.
Throw them onto the skin afterwards.
when I spin my hammer above them the skin and bones will come to life again.
Here's a great story.
I caught a gigantic fish.
it got away.
But it wasn't my fault.
Me and Hymer the giant went out on the vast sea that surrounds the world to catch the Midgard Serpent.
and as bait an ox head.
fat coward.
of course.
I should have known better than to go fishing with a giant.
giants... don't you like bone marrow?
I love it!
then?
- Thor said...
There are so many bones.
Who is going to notice just one?
But perhaps you are afraid?
- Thunder.
- And tears forming.
What's this?
Get out here immediately!
Now!
Look at that.
Which one of you did it?
- Er...
I think it was me.
- You?
Come here!
Thor.
- Boys will be boys.
- Nonsense!
he'll come with us and be your servant.
He looks like a strong lad.
I don't know...
- Good.
That's settled then.
young man.
It is a rare privilege to become servant to the god of thunder.
my dear friends.
What an opportunity for a young man.
Servant to the thunder god...
- Will he be all right?
- Of course he will.
He's tough.
What an honour!
You must be so proud of him.
He is to live in Asgard with the mighty god of thunder.
let's have some breakfast.
to be Thor's servant.
- Will you get to fly in the wagon?
- I suppose so.
- But aren't you afraid?
- At least I won't have to chop wood.
I get to see the world and go on adventures and fish for serpents.
it's not for kids.
Run along now.
Thor only wants men...
Roskva... so I just wanted to say...
- It ought to be around here.
- What?
young man.
there it is.
Tjalfe.
boy.
will it?
- Of course not!
- I built it myself.
- Of course.
And so Roskva and Tjalfe came to Asgard.
the land of wonders.
The land of the gods.
the Tree of Life.
To Valhalla.
Thor's home.
Tjalfe!
Roskva!
Come and help me with the children.
Adventure... hurry up.
She's waiting for us.
Tjalfe!
Roskva!
work.
Why do we have to do everything?
and Loki is never here.
you know Loki.
miserable... or it's straight back to the giants for you!
my little friend...
Please help Uncle Loki out of here.
Good boy.
Damned brat!
You're disgusting.
An embarrassment to your family!
Help!
Can anyone hear me?
Help!
Sif?
but I'll bet it hurts a lot.
he's wet again.
everybody.
Sif.
I...
What a day.
Tjalfe!
Some mead.
Come to Daddy.
son.
I might take you out hunting trolls one day.
Thor said he might take me hunting.
they're crying.
So I hear.
They are teething.
You know that.
my love.
There.
Let's eat.
as usual.
- What is that?
- I Don't know.
He followed me home.
I met some extraordinary people.
I suppose.
- I leaned some amazing tricks.
- It's pure magic.
- Magic?
- Have you been at Utgardsloki's?
- I simply must show you this.
yes.
Now... and abracadabra... breathtaking bat?
You little brat!
Go stand in the corner where you can't do any harm.
then make him disappear.
Thor.
What's he doing now?
children will be children.
I think.
I needed a bat for the next trick anyway.
You'll love this.
- From now on...
- Please!
No more trouble!
Tjalfe.
Gather round.
This is really exciting.
We need two pebbles and the eyelash of a serpent.
and a sprinkling of mistletoe.
Loki!
The little beast is torturing my children!
- How long is that brat staying?
- Until he's learned some manners.
I can't wait for that.
We're leaving now.
Goodbye!
That does it!
Let me have that little monster.
Thor.
Sif will be back.
go outside.
I'll clean up in here.
Off you go.
what a mess.
but I have things to do.
I'll be in my room.
Out!
- What's he doing here?
- Never mind him.
We're busy.
I could sure use some breakfast.
Where is everything?
Never mind.
I didn't need that plate anyway.
dear children.
You're up early.
no!
I noticed you hadn't quite finished.
But I'm sure you will.
- You made the mess!
- You clean it up.
you're the servants.
start sweeping!
- No!
- You'll do as I say.
- You can't tell us what to do.
- This isn't your house.
- We'll see about that.
Him again?
Just wait until Thor hears about this.
He won't listen to us.
Odin!
King of the gods.
he's king of the gods.
He should be able to help us if only we could get to him.
King of the gods?
We'll just get into more trouble.
- We had better wait for Thor.
- You wait then.
I'm leaving.
isn't it?
We have to wait for Thor.
We don't even know this Odin.
He definitely won't listen to you.
You're just a little girl.
What are you doing?
Escaping.
do we?
- Out of the shadows they came.
- Look!
Maybe they know the way.
At you service we are.
Definitely.
do you know the way?
- Are you looking for Odin?
We want to ask him to do us a favour.
- Strange creatures from beyond.
- The boundaries of time.
Of time.
No.
I think you've got it wrong.
We want to...
The king watches over his men.
The head is in trouble if he beats One-Eye.
- We just want to speak to...
- Come along then.
Come along.
Quark.
I hope they take us to Odin.
That head is really creepy.
Why hasn't it got a body?
Boo!
Boo!
Stupid that was.
Didn't move.
I beg your pardon.
and I was hoping you could help.
and we've come a long way...
I'm talking to you!
- What are you worms doing here?
or I'll...
How did you get past me?
Nobody is allowed to disturb Odin!
Will you get outta here...
You little...
I'll get you.
Silence!
Look what I've done.
you may leave.
child.
sir...
Like I was saying -
I mean.
we did everything we were told to.
and I like Thor and Sif.
But Loki never helps... you little worm.
Leave that piece alone.
What are you two worms doing here in the sacred hall of the gods?
I'm dizzy!
what happened?
They kicked us out.
You could have helped.
Of course.
Then I would have been kicked out too.
I told you Odin wouldn't listen to you and that little creep.
Why are you always so mean to him?
- I'm hungry.
- Serves you right.
- I'm cold.
- Tough.
they won't be glad to see him.
- Why do you always pick on him?
- Because everything is his fault.
- That does it.
Goodbye.
- Good riddance.
Quark!
human.
Only you will see clearly when the red one falls.
- And the thunder stills.
- And creation crumbles.
- Rumbles.
- Crumbles.
Just trust your eyes.
human.
need each other.
Someone needs you.
Needs you!
I've been thinking.
I mean...
We could stay here.
Why not?
kids!
Hooray for Quark!
Quark?
You're all right.
So there you are.
now!
not you.
You've caused enough trouble.
That does it!
He's going back to the giants!
you can't do that.
- Why not?
- Because I...
- Go on.
you know...
We had a few drinks -
I mean.
And now I'm stuck with him.
- I'm taking him back.
- Yes.
Do that.
And you're coming with us.
- Utgard.
- Land of giants.
beware!
- Thunder approaches!
- To Utgardsloki!
- Cheers!
Cheers!
Bottoms up!
do you?
you ugly creep!
Here comes dessert.
Remember Quark?
I call dibs on the offal.
little Quark...
That little monster.
I'd sure like to see Thor and his friends now.
I'll bet they have their hands full.
Has it occurred to you that they might send him back?
if it isn't Thor and his friends.
Allow me to introduce myself.
and your cave is my glove.
What brings you to...
Ouch!
- I believe this is yours.
- Not for long.
That little monster is going back to where he belongs.
I presume?
Right.
And when I see him...
You and Utgardsloki don't seem to be the best of buddies.
I must go.
Good luck.
They fell for it.
They're bringing Quark back.
Now for some magic.
You'll receive our visitors.
Open up!
What a surprise.
My friend Thor.
What brings you here?
This.
did he?
He's all yours now.
Goodbye.
do you?
The same old Thor.
We thought we'd seen the last of you in these parts.
Rumour has is that you're having trouble with your new little friend.
I guess it's partly my fault.
Anyone can see that Thor doesn't have the spark of his brighter days.
Given the size of the problem...
Let's not quarrel over such a small matter.
Let's have a series of contests.
Whoever wins is relieved of the little rat.
Or are you afraid of losing?
Afraid?
You're talking to the great god of thunder!
I can handle any giant.
may I propose an eating contest?
For the gods...
Loki!
And for the giants...
Logi!
wins.
may the best stomach...
Begin.
Loki...!
young lady?
not me.
I'm not good at anything.
I... are you?
yes and no.
I... yes.
A race.
And I've decided who should oppose you.
On your marks...
Ready...
Get set...
Go!
He's so stupid.
I've already won.
Enough is enough.
Now it's my turn.
sure it is.
If you are my equal you can empty my horn in one draught.
Sure I can!
old friend.
I'll give you another try.
See if you can lift my cat off the floor.
humour me.
Stop!
old friend.
That's just like you.
To stop when I was winning!
Enough!
I've had enough of your games.
I'm not leaving until one of you meets me in a wrestling match.
Oops...
- I need to talk to you.
- What?
Later.
Thor.
What?
An old woman?
Thor.
- She is stronger than you think.
- I don't fight old women.
my dear lady?
young man.
- Remember.
Only you...
...will see clearly.
- Someone needs you.
- Trust your eyes.
Thor!
the old woman...
She is...
Thor!
Aren't you gonna do something?
you monster!
And that!
Can't you see?
He's dying!
His face...
No!
It's not true.
No.
He's only sleeping.
Thor!
Wake up!
Gods can't die.
Only you will see clearly when the red one falls and the thunder stills.
I must believe.
What happened?
She's a tough old lady.
What are you looking at?
so she won.
What of it?
What is going on?
Shut up!
my friend.
You can't win them all.
So Quark stays with you.
Right?
let's party.
Music!
let's all party!
Victory is ours victory is ours the gods are pitiful
you're staying with us you're staying with us forever
Here you go.
very puzzling.
Loki.
- Be quiet.
I'm thinking.
- It was magic.
I'm quite sure they used magic.
boy.
- But you didn't lose.
- I saw it in the mirror.
- Interesting.
It wasn't a cat at all.
It was the Midgard Serpent.
Loki.
Look at the trough.
It's burnt.
though.
- Of course!
she was Age.
Nobody can fight that.
Not even you.
I'll show those scoundrels!
do we?
- I will handle this.
- You?
me.
listen closely... go play.
And then...
This will do.
my dear friends.
What a beautiful day.
I hope you enjoyed your stay.
we'll survive.
Loki.
Have a safe journey.
Come back soon.
my friends -
- I wasn't my usual honest self with you.
Those contests...
- Simple magic.
- Simple.
are they?
Like this little creature here.
the spell doesn't last.
- What have you done to him?
- Absolutely nothing.
The real Quark is... but as long as we got through the gates without him... dummy.
you old goat.
I'll keep the little brat.
There is so much to tell.
That place was simply filthy.
they even had me fooled.
But once I realised what was going on - what's for dinner?
Thor?
- For you.
- For me?
A real sword!
Thank you.
son.
A true warrior knows when not to use it.

The wind tells a story, one that took place a long time ago when Yggdrasil, the Tree of Life, stood in the centre of the world.
In Asgard, land of the gods of the Vikings.
Here lived the one-eyed Odin, king of the gods and the mighty Thor, god of thunder.
From all over Asgard, the gods would gather here, in Valhalla the greatest castle of all.
Here they received the worship of mortal men which gives strength and life to gods.
From Valhalla, Odin surveyed the three worlds and from here, he sent out his ravens.
To gather news from faraway lands.
Beyond the land of Utgard home of the race of trolls whom men called giants the lords of darkness and chaos, beyond Utgard was Midgard, land of humankind.
Home of proud Vikings and industrious farmers.
From time to time, the gods went to Midgard to visit their human worshippers.
Tjalfe, come inside!
There's a storm coming.
You'll get soaked, you silly boy!
Shoo!
Roskva!
Come back, both of you, or I'll send your father after you.
Greetings, good people.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Loki, the magnificent.
This gentleman is Thor, the god of thunder, the roisterous--
That'll do.
We're staying here tonight.
- We haven't much food to offer--
- Don't worry.
- I'll kill one of my goats.
- We could make a--
But isn't that unfair on the poor goat?
Don't worry.
He's used to it.
Are you really the mighty Thor?
Yes.
Why are you sulking, Roskva?
He can't just kill the goat like that.
Of course he can.
He's a god.
He protects us from sorcery and giants.
He is a mighty warrior.
He is strong.
Take this, and that, you monster!
And now, the final blow!
So you give up, huh?
Victory is mine!
Tjalfe, the mighty cow slayer.
You wait and see.
Children, come in here.
The meat is tender.
Remember: eat as much as you like but don't break the bones.
Throw them onto the skin afterwards.
Tomorrow, when I spin my hammer above them the skin and bones will come to life again.
Here's a great story.
Once I was out fishing, I caught a gigantic fish.
Unfortunately, it got away.
But it wasn't my fault.
Me and Hymer the giant went out on the vast sea that surrounds the world to catch the Midgard Serpent.
For hook I used an anchor, and as bait an ox head.
...just when I was about to land it.
Hymer, that big, fat coward.
The Midgard Serpent got away, of course.
I should have known better than to go fishing with a giant.
Bunch of sissies, giants--
Tell me, Tjalfe, don't you like bone marrow?
I love it!
- Why don't you have a taste, then?
- Thor said--
There are so many bones.
Who is going to notice just one?
But perhaps you are afraid?
- Thunder.
- And tears forming.
What's this?
Get out here immediately!
Now!
Look at that.
Which one of you did it?
- Er...
I think it was me.
- You?
Come here!
- But he said that--
- Come now, Thor.
- Boys will be boys.
- Nonsense!
Let's say that as punishment for harming the goat, he'll come with us and be your servant.
He looks like a strong lad.
- Well, I don't know--
- Good.
That's settled then.
Today is your lucky day, young man.
It is a rare privilege to become servant to the god of thunder.
Congratulations, my dear friends.
What an opportunity for a young man.
Servant to the thunder god--
- Will he be all right?
- Of course he will.
He's tough.
What an honour!
You must be so proud of him.
He is to live in Asgard with the mighty god of thunder.
Now, let's have some breakfast.
- Where are you going, Tjalfe?
- To Asgard, to be Thor's servant.
- Will you get to fly in the wagon?
- I suppose so.
- But aren't you afraid?
- At least I won't have to chop wood.
I get to see the world and go on adventures and fish for serpents.
- Can I come too, Tjalfe?
- No, it's not for kids.
Run along now.
Thor only wants men--
Roskva...
I'll be leaving soon, so I just wanted to say--
- It ought to be around here.
- What?
The rainbow, young man.
Ah, there it is.
Come along, Tjalfe.
Pretty, isn't it?
Now, come along, boy.
- It won't break, will it?
- Of course not!
- I built it myself.
- Of course.
And so Roskva and Tjalfe came to Asgard.
Asgard, the land of wonders.
The land of the gods.
To Yggdrasil, the Tree of Life.
To Valhalla.
And to Bilskirnir, Thor's home.
Tjalfe!
Roskva!
Come and help me with the children.
Adventure...
Tjalfe, hurry up.
She's waiting for us.
Tjalfe!
Roskva!
Work, work, work.
Why do we have to do everything?
Thor is always out rumbling and having fun, and Loki is never here.
Well, you know Loki.
For the last time, get me out of here, you little, miserable...
Pull me up immediately, or it's straight back to the giants for you!
Quark, my little friend...
Please help Uncle Loki out of here.
Good boy.
Damned brat!
You're disgusting.
An embarrassment to your family!
Help!
Can anyone hear me?
Help!
They're crying because they're teething, right, Sif?
I don't remember when I was teething, but I'll bet it hurts a lot.
Sif, he's wet again.
Hello, everybody.
Sif.
- Having fun, boy?
- Well, I--
What a day.
Tjalfe!
Some mead.
Come to Daddy.
Thanks, son.
I might take you out hunting trolls one day.
Roskva, Thor said he might take me hunting.
Sif, they're crying.
So I hear.
They are teething.
You know that.
- Can't you do something?
- Yes, my love.
There.
Let's eat.
- Hello, my dear friends.
- Loki...
In time for dinner, as usual.
- What is that?
- I don't know.
He followed me home.
I met some extraordinary people.
- Trolls and giants, I suppose.
- I learned some amazing tricks.
- It's pure magic.
- Magic?
- Have you been at Utgardsloki's?
- I simply must show you this.
- Loki, control your little friend.
- Yes, yes.
Now...
I take an apple, a few rose leaves, and abracadabra...
A beautiful, bright, beguiling, breathtaking bat?
You little brat!
Go stand in the corner where you can't do any harm.
If you're so good at magic, then make him disappear.
Unfortunately, the spells don't last, Thor.
What's he doing now?
- There, there--
- Oh, children will be children.
- Loki, who is he?
- His name is Quark, I think.
I needed a bat for the next trick anyway.
You'll love this.
- From now on--
- Please!
No more trouble!
Roskva, Tjalfe.
Gather round.
This is really exciting.
We need two pebbles and the eyelash of a serpent.
Mix them all together.
A little water, and a sprinkling of mistletoe.
Loki!
The little beast is torturing my children!
- How long is that brat staying?
- Until he's learned some manners.
Well, I can't wait for that.
We're leaving now.
Goodbye!
That does it!
Let me have that little monster.
Calm down, Thor.
Sif will be back.
Sif will be livid.
If you want to make thunder, go outside.
I'll clean up in here.
Off you go.
Dear me, what a mess.
Poor things.
I wish I could help, but I have things to do.
I'll be in my room.
Out!
- What's he doing here?
- Never mind him.
We're busy.
I could sure use some breakfast.
Where is everything?
Never mind.
I didn't need that plate anyway.
Good morning, dear children.
You're up early.
What?
Oh, no!
I noticed you hadn't quite finished.
But I'm sure you will.
- You made the mess!
- You clean it up.
You seem to forget something.
I'm the god, you're the servants.
- Now, start sweeping!
- No!
- You'll do as I say.
- You can't tell us what to do.
- This isn't your house.
- We'll see about that.
Him again?
Just wait until Thor hears about this.
He won't listen to us.
Odin!
King of the gods.
- What about him?
- Well, he's king of the gods.
He should be able to help us if only we could get to him.
King of the gods?
We'll just get into more trouble.
- We had better wait for Thor.
- You wait then.
I'm leaving.
Long way down, isn't it?
We have to wait for Thor.
We don't even know this Odin.
He definitely won't listen to you.
You're just a little girl.
What are you doing?
Escaping.
We don't care, do we?
- Out of the shadows they came.
- Look!
Maybe they know the way.
At you service we are.
Definitely.
- Well, do you know the way?
- Are you looking for Odin?
We want to ask him to do us a favour.
- Strange creatures from beyond.
- The boundaries of time.
Of time.
No.
I think you've got it wrong.
We want to--
The king watches over his men.
The head is in trouble if he beats One-Eye.
- We just want to speak to--
- Come along then.
Come along.
Come, Quark.
I hope they take us to Odin.
That head is really creepy.
Why hasn't it got a body?
Boo!
Boo!
Stupid that was.
Didn't move.
I beg your pardon.
We have a small problem, and I was hoping you could help.
We've been terribly mistreated, and we've come a long way--
- Hey, I'm talking to you!
- What are you worms doing here?
Odin wants to be left alone.
Get out of here, or I'll--
How did you get past me?
Nobody is allowed to disturb Odin!
Will you get outta here...
You little...
I'll get you.
Silence!
Look what I've done.
Rolf, you may leave.
How dare you disturb the king of the gods?
Speak, child.
Well, sir...
Like I was saying we're being terribly mistreated by some people... er, gods, I mean.
My brother and I, and Quark here, we did everything we were told to.
I don't mind working, and I like Thor and Sif.
But Loki never helps--
Get away from the board, you little worm.
Leave that piece alone.
What are you two worms doing here in the sacred hall of the gods?
I'm dizzy!
Well, what happened?
They kicked us out.
You could have helped.
Of course.
Then I would have been kicked out too.
I told you Odin wouldn't listen to you and that little creep.
Why are you always so mean to him?
- I'm hungry.
- Serves you right.
- I'm cold.
- Tough.
- I can't wait to get home.
- Well, they won't be glad to see him.
- Why do you always pick on him?
- Because everything is his fault.
- That does it.
Goodbye.
- Good riddance.
Oh, Quark!
Good day, young man.
Greetings, human.
Only you will see clearly when the red one falls.
- And the thunder stills.
- And creation crumbles.
- Rumbles.
- Crumbles.
Just trust your eyes.
And hold on to your belief, human.
All beings need one another, need each other.
Someone needs you.
Needs you!
Roskva, I've been thinking.
I mean...
We could stay here.
Why not?
We could build a tree house and live in the woods.
Follow me, kids!
Hooray for Quark!
You know what, Quark?
You're all right.
So there you are.
You two are coming home, now!
No, not you.
You've caused enough trouble.
That does it!
He's going back to the giants!
- No, you can't do that.
- Why not?
- Because I--
- Go on.
Well, the giants...
Utgardsloki, you know...
We had a few drinks and I bet I could teach him to behave...
Quark, I mean.
And now I'm stuck with him.
- I'm taking him back.
- Yes.
Do that.
And you're coming with us.
- Utgard.
- Land of giants.
- Giants, beware!
- Thunder approaches!
- To Utgardsloki!
- Cheers!
Cheers!
Bottoms up!
Think I'm an airstrip, do you?
Cheers, you ugly creep!
Here comes dessert.
Remember Quark?
I call dibs on the offal.
Oh, little Quark...
That little monster.
I'd sure like to see Thor and his friends now.
I'll bet they have their hands full.
Has it occurred to you that they might send him back?
Well, if it isn't Thor and his friends.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm called Skrymer, and your cave is my glove.
What brings you to...
Ouch!
- I believe this is yours.
- Not for long.
That little monster is going back to where he belongs.
To Utgardsloki, I presume?
Right.
And when I see him...
You and Utgardsloki don't seem to be the best of buddies.
Well, I must go.
Good luck.
They fell for it.
They're bringing Quark back.
Now for some magic.
You'll receive our visitors.
Open up!
What a surprise.
My friend Thor.
What brings you here?
This.
Put your nose out of joint, did he?
He's all yours now.
Goodbye.
You want to fight, do you?
The same old Thor.
We thought we'd seen the last of you in these parts.
Rumour has is that you're having trouble with your new little friend.
I guess it's partly my fault.
Anyone can see that Thor doesn't have the spark of his brighter days.
Given the size of the problem...
Let's not quarrel over such a small matter.
Let's have a series of contests.
Whoever wins is relieved of the little rat.
Or are you afraid of losing?
Afraid?
You're talking to the great god of thunder!
I can handle any giant.
Excuse me, may I propose an eating contest?
For the gods...
Loki!
And for the giants...
Logi!
He who reaches the string first, wins.
My dear trolls and giants, may the best stomach...
Begin.
Loki, Loki, Loki...!
Not bad.
What about you, young lady?
No, not me.
I'm not good at anything.
- And you, young man?
- Oh no, I...
Come on.
You're not afraid of a little contest, are you?
Well, yes and no.
I...
A race, yes.
A race.
And I've decided who should oppose you.
On your marks...
Ready...
Get set...
Go!
He's so stupid.
I've already won.
Enough is enough.
Now it's my turn.
Sure, sure it is.
If you are my equal you can empty my horn in one draught.
Sure I can!
Fair is fair, old friend.
I'll give you another try.
See if you can lift my cat off the floor.
- My patience is running out!
- Come on, humour me.
Stop!
Yes, we don't want any harm to come to you, old friend.
That's just like you.
To stop when I was winning!
Enough!
I've had enough of your games.
I'm not leaving until one of you meets me in a wrestling match.
Oops...
- I need to talk to you.
- What?
Later.
Fight me, Thor.
What?
An old woman?
- You must be joking.
- Elli is my mother, Thor.
- She is stronger than you think.
- I don't fight old women.
How about a dance, my dear lady?
Good day, young man.
Remember.
Only you... will see clearly.
- Someone needs you.
- Trust your eyes.
Thor!
Thor, the old woman...
She is...
Thor!
Aren't you gonna do something?
Take this!
And that, you monster!
And that!
Can't you see?
He's dying!
His face...
No!
It's not true.
No.
He's only sleeping.
Thor!
Wake up!
Gods can't die.
Only you will see clearly when the red one falls and the thunder stills.
I must believe, I must believe.
What happened?
She's a tough old lady.
What are you looking at?
All right, so she won.
What of it?
What is going on?
Shut up!
Well, my friend.
You can't win them all.
So Quark stays with you.
Right?
Come on, let's party.
Music!
Come on, let's all party!
Victory is ours
Victory is ours
The gods are pitiful The gods are pitiful The gods are pitiful
You're staying with us You're staying with us forever
Here you go.
- Remarkable old woman.
- Yes, very puzzling.
- I think they've been having us on.
- I tried to tell you, Loki.
- Be quiet.
I'm thinking.
- It was magic.
I'm quite sure they used magic.
- I'm sorry I lost, boy.
- But you didn't lose.
- I saw it in the mirror.
- Interesting.
It wasn't a cat at all.
It was the Midgard Serpent.
And you didn't lose either, Loki.
Look at the trough.
It's burnt.
- The old woman beat me, though.
- Of course!
Thor, she was Age.
Nobody can fight that.
Not even you.
I'll show those scoundrels!
Just a moment.
We don't want any more broken bones, do we?
- I will handle this.
- You?
Yes, me.
Now, listen closely...
Children, go play.
And then...
This will do.
Good morning, my dear friends.
What a beautiful day.
I hope you enjoyed your stay.
- Too bad you have to keep Quark.
- Oh, we'll survive.
- Won't we, Thor?
- We sure will, Loki.
Have a safe journey.
Come back soon.
And by the way, my friends I wasn't my usual honest self with you.
Those contests...
- Simple magic.
- Simple.
Things aren't always what they seem, are they?
Like this little creature here.
Unfortunately, the spell doesn't last.
- What have you done to him?
- Absolutely nothing.
The real Quark is...
I locked him up, but as long as we got through the gates without him...
- It's a chicken.
- I know that, dummy.
You got me, you old goat.
I'll keep the little brat.
There is so much to tell.
That place was simply filthy.
They're so ugly and cunning, they even had me fooled.
But once I realised what was going on well, I duped them.
By the way, what's for dinner?
- Boy...
- Yes, Thor?
- For you.
- For me?
A real sword!
Thank you.
Remember, son.
A true warrior knows when not to use it.
-What's happening?
-Isn't that obvious?
-Running into turbulence.
-Rather more than turbulence.
Don't talk in riddles, man.
Your colleague is aiming the Hyperion III into the eye of the Black Hole of Tartarus.
Bruchner must be stopped.
Get every Vervoid to the bridge area.
-Marsh gas?
-A methane derivative.
Marsh gas?
Where the devil has that come from?
What is it you two know that I don't?
Questions later.
Will smoke masks be any good?
No, they'd be completely inadequate.
You're saying that none of us can go in there?
-It'd be suicide!
-Here, let me go.
No, it's my ship.
If there is a risk to be taken, I'll take it.
-No!
-There's no need for heroics from either of you.
Come to the bridge.
If they make a hash of it in there, we're finished.
I doubt if that will happen, Commodore.
I am grateful to you both.
Now that the air is breathable, I'll resume command.
I am afraid that isn't going to be possible, Commodore.
What he is stating, in the usually devious human manner, is that we are taking over the ship.
A hijack?
But you Mogarians are a peace-loving race.
Violence is repugnant to you.
No one will be harmed if they obey orders.
Rudge, I will personally see to it that you rot in jail!
I should restrain that tongue of yours, Commodore.
The Mogarians may not believe in violence, but I don't share their qualms.
All my life, someone like you has been patronising me, treating me with contempt.
Well, I'd welcome the opportunity of settling the score.
Mr Rudge, take the hostages to the passenger lounge.
Surely you can contact the bridge now?
Still not responding, Mr Doland.
I've just tried.
Hold on, Rudge.
If we are being hijacked, I think we deserve an explanation.
Any more unexpected moves, and it won't be an explanation you'll get.
We're being hijacked!
If you don't want to get caught, come on!
Quickly.
No, Doctor.
Over there, away from the door.
Then you won't be tempted to try anything stupid.
One moment, Commodore, I'll take the keys to the vault.
Blazes, you will.
Stay back.
Professor Lasky, reach into the Commodore's pocket and take out the keys.
Carefully!
What do you want in the vault?
For me, not a thing.
The Mogarians are after the consignment of precious metals.
Got this quaint notion it was plundered from their planet.
They're just recovering stolen property.
-That can't be your motive.
-It's greed!
Not completely, pride as well.
After this voyage, I was being written off as a has-been and put out to grass.
So I decided to arrange a more comfortable retirement.
If you have any decency left, you'll get this man some medical treatment.
There's a first aid kit in the cabinet.
Rudge, this hijack is just a sideshow.
There's a much greater menace.
Not my problem, Doctor.
In less than an hour, we will rendezvous with our pick-up.
Here, let me.
After all, I am a Doctor.
Rudge, you're nothing but a squalid criminal.
If I am, where does that place you, Professor?
The Hyperion III is no longer under the command of Commodore Travers.
All personnel must remain at their posts.
If there is any attempt to approach the lounge or the bridge, the hostages will be killed.
I'll put out a call for help.
Oh, great!
Millions of miles from anywhere and we're completely isolated.
Can you organise a squad of guards?
But you heard what the Mogarian said, they'll kill the hostages.
What makes you think they won't anyway?
You're surely not naive enough to accept the word of a hijacker.
He's right, we can't just do nothing.
But if the guards go crashing in, they'll be signing four death warrants.
Not unless we can find a way of warning the hostages.
You don't believe that Rudge is behind these killings, do you?
No.
No, he's just a weak man gone rogue.
So, whatever the outcome of this hijack, we're still at the mercy of a murderer.
Or murderers.
-What are you doing here?
-We did not request refreshment.
Doctor.
The air duct.
What you're doing in there, don't you know dangerous it is?
Shall I join you?
There's going to be an attack on the lounge.
When you hear the fire alarm, dive for cover.
-No.
-What do you mean, "No"?
Too risky.
Attack the bridge.
-The bridge?
-You heard.
Now get out of that air duct, quickly.
Okay.
It is not only we who kill animal-kind.
They kill each other.
They have no respect for any form of life.
We shall resume the hunt.
Oxygen's toxic to a Mogarian.
Yes, but how?
I mean, who could have done this?
Forget playing the detective.
Let's concentrate on the living.
Rudge has to be convinced that the hijack's a lost cause.
And that's going to take more than words.
Well, those face plates, they'll do the trick.
Mr Rudge, hold your fire, we're coming in.
The Mogarians are dead.
Leave him to the guards.
Get up on the bridge.
Now.
Once I get this ship back on course,
I want some answers from you, Professor.
And that goes for you, too, Doctor.
I haven't been holding out on you, Commodore.
There's an audiotape that will explain everything.
-Then why haven't I heard it?
-Because it's been stolen.
I would like carte blanche to search all the cabins.
-You've got it.
-Another request, I need a phaser.
A phaser?
You?
Exceptional circumstances require exceptional measures.
I don't buy that.
And why the public announcement about the tape?
Everyone could hear.
Could they?
I recognise that innocent tone.
What's going on?
Mel, I entered this affair as a Judas goat.
I intend to re-adopt the role.
Now, if Professor Lasky had the tape, where do you think she'd hide it?
-Lasky?
-Mmm.
Her cabin, or her locker in the gym.
What are you?
If you're looking for a certain tape, Doctor,
I don't think you'll find it in there.
Does that mean you've hidden it somewhere else?
Obviously, a denial isn't going to impress you.
May I know of what I am accused?
Murder, amongst other things.
Murder?
Am I supposed to treat this seriously?
I have narrowed the suspects down to two, you and Professor Lasky.
Then I suggest you search the professor's cabin.
I already have.
You really are serious.
I'm never frivolous about murder.
So, this tape, it's important?
-Crucial.
-I see.
Well, I know I'm innocent, and I can't believe the professor's guilty, but if it'll end this nonsense, then...
I know of another place where the professor keeps things.
If you've finished with my tracksuit...
I was just admiring the...the design.
Don't bother to lie, you're not very good at it.
No tape.
That's what you were hoping to find, wasn't it?
I'm afraid the professor has the only key.
And you're not going to object if I force it open?
Doctor.
Your tape.
Not that it'll do you much good.
I've wiped it.
Yes, I rather thought you might have done.
You still suspected me, yet you came down here?
A reckless streak.
I'm prone to them.
It wasn't difficult to pinpoint you.
The first murder could only have been carried out by someone with access to this unit.
The second needed poison.
Even the abortive attempt on Mel's life could only have been committed by someone who could go unchallenged into the Isolation Room and get the anaesthetic.
All this could have applied to Lasky.
No, not the Mogarians.
She was a hostage when they were slaughtered.
And my motive?
Could be jealousy, professional envy.
I'd say it was the more commonplace avarice.
Then you're not as astute as I thought, Doctor.
Those creatures, we call them Vervoids, represent vast economic power.
Provided you can get them back to Earth.
Oh, but I shall, no matter what the cost.
And robots can be dumped on a scrap heap.
Vervoids will run the factories and farms at practically no cost.
All they need is sunlight and water.
I take it you have someone willing to finance this exploitation.
A consortium with the vision to recognise the potential of the Vervoids.
Vision?
You're talking about slave labour!
The most enduring and spectacular empire, Rome, was built on slave labour.
Came to a pretty unpleasant end, though.
Which brings us neatly to you.
I took the precaution of disarming it.
I also took the precaution of taking the Commodore into my confidence.
Throw him in the brig.
Doland will soon be joining them.
No, no, I'm not your enemy.
Without me, you wouldn't exist.
I'm your friend.
You created these psychopaths.
Tell me how to get rid of them.
The Vervoids are not psychopaths.
Doctor, I heard them say they intended to wipe us out.
Something must have gone wrong, radically wrong.
A malfunction of the DNA.
Why is it none of you can see what's so glaringly obvious?
Maybe we lack your divine insight.
-No divine insight, just logic.
-Logic?
When you overheard the Vervoids, Mel, how did they describe us?
Um, wait a second...
Animal-kind.
Not human beings, not Mogarians.
Animal-kind.
-I hope this is relevant.
-It is, he's making sense.
The Vervoids are plants.
At some stage, directly or indirectly, all animal-kind consumes plant life.
Without it, we'd perish.
I must have been blinded by professional vanity.
Bruchner saw it.
I should have, too.
Doctor, if you're right, then coexistence with the Vervoids is an impossibility.
It's a question of self-preservation, kill or be killed.
A conflict in which there can be no justice.
Equally, there's no choice, and that goes for you too, Doctor.
We need your undivided commitment.
And there you have it, the direct request.
I did not meddle.
I was presented with an appeal.
And not just from anybody, but from the man in whom authority was vested.
I accept your argument.
Nor, Valeyard, can you refute it.
Perhaps we should await the outcome of this adventure, my lady.
Doctor, do you wish to continue?
There's not enough left to make a spoonful of herbicide.
The Vervoids must have got here first.
Any more ideas, Doctor?
Why can't I rid myself of the feeling we're approaching this the wrong way round?
Professor, do Vervoid chloroplasts function normally?
A cytogeneticist now?
You're a man of varied talents.
Don't prevaricate, Professor.
Yes, Vervoid chloroplasts trap sunlight as is normal with all plants.
Doctor, there's something out there.
-Is there another exit?
-Not this side of the hold.
I'm going to talk to them.
-They won't listen!
-Perhaps they will.
To me.
I wasn't going to exploit them like Doland, they'll know that.
They'll spare no one!
-I have to try.
-Doctor!
-You must know who I am.
-Yes, Professor Lasky, we do.
Then you must also be aware that I mean you no harm.
All animal-kind is our enemy, Professor, even you.
How could they?
It's obscene.
Not to a Vervoid.
You can't justify it.
It's just...
It's a matter of perspective, Mel.
In your house in Pease Pottage, you had a large garden.
What did you do with the plants and weeds you uprooted?
Put them on a compost heap.
They're obeying instinct.
Like migrating birds or salmon swimming relentlessly upstream to spawn even though they might die.
A compulsive following of the life cycle.
Come on, Mel.
It's useless, Commodore!
They're everywhere!
-We need your help, Commodore.
-Name it.
Like the Vervoids, we're being driven by blind instinct.
-Kill or be killed.
-We've been over that.
What if instead of bringing their lives to an abrupt end, we did the opposite, accelerated the Vervoid life cycle?
How the blazes do we do that?
-Vionesium.
-Vionesium?
A rare metal found on the airless planet of Mogar.
-And worth a prince's ransom.
-Or a hijack.
You mean, there's a consignment on board?
That's right, in the vault.
But how will this vionesium accelerate the Vervoid life cycle?
It's a substance similar to magnesium.
Exposed to oxygenated air, it releases incredibly intense light and carbon dioxide.
Spring, summer, autumn, all condensed into a few moments.
Seasons which I may be a long time enjoying again if I go robbing my own vault.
Seasons you can forget if you don't.
We've seen what these creatures can do.
You've no alternative, Commodore.
You can't send for outside help, the ship's completely cut off.
The Doctor's the only hope you've got.
All right, Doctor, you can have the vionesium.
What's the drill?
First, you must drive the Vervoids back to their lair.
Me?
Plunge the ship into darkness.
They're never going to give up!
Attention all passengers and crew, a major fault has developed in the generators.
To effect necessary repairs, the heating will be shut down and auxiliary lighting only will be in operation.
Are all the Vervoids here?
There is still another to come.
This power fault could be a trick.
What can they gain?
Animal-kind need the life-support system.
They must repair the generator to survive.
The vionesium, Mel!
You can restore power, it's over.
Restore power.
-Till we meet again, Mel.
Doctor.
-Yes.
Don't say that.
I owe you my thanks, Doctor, but let's make this the sweet sorrow of a final parting, hmm?
I shall remember that the next time we get a mayday call.
She means that too.
Memory like an elephant.
That's his idea of a compliment, comparing me to an elephant.
But so ludicrously appropriate, I find it amusing.
Well, at least if you're laughing, you can't be singing.
You ever heard his rendering of On with the Motley?
Count your blessings.
Bye.
Did none of the unfortunate creatures survive, Doctor?
No, my lady.
Had even a leaf survived and fallen on fertile soil, a Vervoid would have grown.
Every Vervoid was destroyed by your ingenious plan.
Yes.
Whether or not the Doctor has proved himself innocent of meddling is no longer the cardinal issue before this court.
He has proved himself guilty of a far greater crime.
You refer to Article Seven of Gallifreyan law?
No, my lady, that cannot apply!
Had a single Vervoid reached Earth, the human race would've been eliminated!
Article Seven permits no exceptions.
The Doctor has destroyed a complete species.
The charge must now be genocide.
Yeah, but Marian, this isn't even my territory.
How did I know they were going to have
The worst winter in 35 years?
No, I am not with some cheap floozy.
I'm in some creepy motel, for god's sakes.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You hear that, Marian?
Yeah, that's the wind.
It's getting worse, too.
Yeah.
It's...
Uh, Marian.
Uh, I got to go.
They're, uh...
They're towing my car.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
I love you.
Hello, there.
Oh.
Hi.
Do you work here?
Uh, no, no.
I'm just, uh, checking in myself.
Oh.
Chester Caruso is the name.
A, um, regional sales rep for Gormacker lingerie.
What an unfortunate name.
Caruso?
No.
Gormacker's.
Well, I'll tell you, we're, uh, under the dresses
Of some of the most respectable women in America.
And some of the most unrespectable ones, too.
Hey, listen, you know, it's, uh, it's still pretty early.
Uh, what do you say we go get a couple of drinks?
You know, maybe a little dancing.
They used to call me "soft shoes Caruso."
Soft shoes?
Oh, yeah.
I'm still fast on my feet.
And slow where it counts, if you know what I mean.
You look a little dead where it counts to me.
What's with all the racket out here?
You're interrupting my exercise.
Well, I'm terribly sorry, but if it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to get a room.
You happen to have
The only vacancy sign this side of Kalamazoo.
You, uh, two are together?
Well, if you only have one, we could share.
Uh, no.
No, we're not together.
Could I just sign the registry and get my key, please?
You can sign right here.
You can have cottage number eight.
It's real nice in there.
It's got one of them
Magic finger mattresses to massage your back.
Mmm.
Perfect.
Thank you.
Hey!
What do you want?
I want a room.
Well, I ain't got no more rooms.
Well, what's that?
There's a key hanging there.
Uh, that's uh, cottage number seven.
Uh...
I don't let nobody go in there.
What do you mean, you don't let nobody go in there?
I need a room.
It's freezing outside.
What kind of a motel is this, anyway?
I'm remodeling.
Look, I'll give you an extra ten bucks for the room.
And I'm going to warn you.
I don't go for no hanky panky in my rooms.
So put those thoughts out of your head right now.
I hear anything going on between you and miss Kalamazoo,
I'll be down there with my shotgun lickety split,
You got that?
Yeah, yeah.
That's a...
Interesting turtle you got there.
His, uh, name is Prometheus.
It's, uh, kind of a memorial to my father.
He liked turtles.
You like turtles?
Yeah, sure.
Everybody likes turtle, don't they?
Dad sure did.
Well...
Oh!
Uh, here.
Have some pigs' feet.
Uh, well...
Ah, go on.
Compliments of the house.
They're great for the digestive tract.
Yeah, maybe I'll have some later.
And say good night to Prometheus.
He knows you're here now.
Good night, Prometheus.
And, uh, don't steal the soap.
The last guy who stole the soap
Ended up having a bad accident on the highway.
I won't steal the soap.
Whew.
Ah, just what I need.
A nice, warm bath.
Better make that a nice cold bath.
Boy, I haven't seen one of these since I was a kid.
What the...
Do you like it?
Oh, yes, but...
I hope you don't mind I turned the radio up.
Well, it's the only thing I've had to keep me company for...
Oh, Harry.
I'm so glad you came back to me.
But I'm not Harry.
Oh...
Um...
Um...
Now, now.
We mustn't go too fast.
Remember what happened the last time.
No.
I don't remember.
I don't even remember being with you.
I...
How did we...
Harry.
I am trying so hard to please you.
But I'm not Harry.
Let's pretend then.
Oh.
It's like we've never been apart.
You want to dance?
Dance?
Come on.
You never used to be this shy before.
Harry.
Cheek to cheek is so much more romantic.
You know, I haven't danced like this in years.
Not since the old imperial ballroom.
Marian and I used to go there all the time.
What's that for?
You know I don't like it when you talk about your other women.
Marian isn't "other women," she's my...
Your what?
Your mistress?
Your girlfriend?
My wife.
Oh, you're married?
It's not a secret.
We've been...
What I mean is, we...
Hey, soft shoes, will you turn that radio down?
Uh, I'm sorry I, uh...
I must have fallen asleep.
I...
What the heck's going on in there?
Nothing.
Uh...
It won't happen again.
I promise.
Yeah, but I've got to get some sleep.
was that Marian?
Oh, no, no.
That was, uh...
Another woman?
Uh, no, no, you don't understand.
I had a big surprise planned for you, Harry.
A really big surprise.
But now...
We can still do it.
There's no need to get upset.
I haven't done anything wrong.
No, Harry.
It's too late.
You can't keep a girl like me waiting around forever.
Look.
Look at what I brought you.
You've broken my heart one too many times, Harry.
Oh, my god.
Good-bye, Harry.
But I'm not...
My name is Chester!
My god.
Just what in the devil?
I've been shot.
Where?
Everywhere!
In the shoulder and the...
I don't see any blood.
I was shot.
This is crazy!
You been drinking?
No, for god's sakes!
There's whisky on your breath.
Look, there's a crazy woman with a gun in my room.
Whose fault is that?
I told you I didn't want you in that cottage.
You're not listening to what I'm saying!
I'm listening.
You're ranting like a madman.
I should never have given you the room.
Oh!
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm calling the police!
If you won't...
Now hold on just a minute.
This is a nice, respectable place here.
Look, if you're not gonna do something,
I'll punch you in the nose.
All right, all right.
Hold your horses, will ya?
I'll go down there with ya.
I don't see anyone.
Check the bathroom.
This what scared ya?
Never seen that before.
Let me get my sleep, will ya?
Why don't you check the closet?
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Hey, you really are a sick one, aren't ya?
Oh, no, that's my business.
Oh, I'm sure it is.
No, it-it really is my business.
I-I sell women's lingerie.
Uh-huh.
I think I want another ten dollars for the room.
What?
!
You're crazy!
You're the one who's crazy around here.
Women with guns in your room.
Want to go find yourself another place?
Here.
If I were you,
I'd think about giving up the booze.
That's tomorrow.
Oh, my god!
Oh, Harry, I'm so sorry I scared you like that.
No, you-you don't understand.
I'm not Harry.
I'm Chester.
Chester Caruso.
Remember that big surprise I promised ya?
I don't remember anything.
I'm not Harry.
I'm Chester Caruso!
I'm a lingerie salesman.
I've never done this territory before.
I'm from ohio.
I have a wife and three kids.
Close your eyes, Harry.
Close them, Harry!
In 29 years of marriage,
I've only been unfaithful to my wife once.
I don't even remember it.
Maybe it never even happened.
We were both smashed.
I'm not a bad person.
All I wanted was a chance.
A chance to dance, to...
You're gonna have your chance to dance,
Harry.
Oh, forgive me, Marian.
I promise I'll never leave Toledo again.
I'll get a desk job.
Harry...
Remember the first time you saw me, Harry?
It was at that dance pavilion down by the lake.
And you said I was the most beautiful girl
You'd ever seen.
You fell in love with me right there.
At first sight.
I did?
Don't you remember, Harry?
Oh, let's relive that moment tonight.
Just you and me.
They used to call me "soft shoes."
The greatest ballroom dancer in three counties.
The pride of Toledo.
Hey, I thought I told you to keep it down in there!
Sweetheart...
Don't you call me sweetheart.
Now what's going on in there anyway?
Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Uh...
I have to go.
Hey!
She's gone.
She's not who you think she is.
I swear to you.
I don't even know her.
Why don't you come on in, Harry?
The door's unlocked.
The water's still warm.
Whoa.
Care to join me?
Don't worry.
We won't touch anything till you get here.
Any idea what might have happened to him?
No, but he was a nut.
Waking me up in the middle of the night,
Saying some woman was shooting at him.
You didn't hear anybody with him?
Any shots or anything?
No, all I heard was that darn music.
Kept playing it all night long.
Strange is what I'd call it.
That's that same room that that young gal
Drowned your daddy in.
If I remember correctly,
She went and killed herself
Right after we questioned her.
What are you talking about?
You're not saying that you believe something like th...
Oh, I'm not sure what I believe in.
But I'd be a hell of a lot happier
If we just tore that whole damn cottage down.
I knew I never should have rented it.
I think I hear that music again.
That's impossible.
We turned everything off in there.
[growling]
[knocks]
[groans]
[female] Stanley, Stanley, quit screwing' around!
Stanley!
Stanley, I'm right in the middle of my program!
For Chrissake, Stanley!
Lay off me, beautiful, I almost got this baby wired.
Yeah... it's gonna be... dynamite.
Whoa!
Hey, my TV flipped out.
I missed the new Noodles video.
Earth Station Putterman is at it again.
Oh, Daddy.
- ...but I think it's okay.
- I think this thing is a piece of--
- He's such a dork.

He thinks he's a genius, what can you do?
- [doorbell rings]
- Oh, I'll get it.
[sighs] And one and two.
Hi, Gramps!
Hey, honeybee.
You know the one about the U-2s?
- Uh, the band?
- No, the spy planes.
Oh, yeah, I think I saw 'em on MTV.
MTV?
Phooey!
[water trickles] [crackles]
[Stanley] Je-sus!
What's with this thing, Norton, I'm gettin' electrocuted here?
I tried to warn you, Mr. P.
These do-it-yourself 100s are kinda temperamental.
Yeah, gimme a break guy, I need a hand here.
Sorry, Mr. Putterman, no can do.
The warranty covers repairs only.
You insisted on the 100, Mr. P.
I told you they were trouble.
Yeah?
Well, when I get through with her, she's gonna be the hottest dish in town.
... four, five, six, seven, eight.
one, two three...
Hi Dad, how was downtown today?
Downtown, phooey!
I'm sick a downtown.
Used to be the place to go, talk to people, disseminate your literature-- feel like you were doin' some good in the world.
Now it's just bums and weirdos and kooks coming out of the woodwork.
Getting so decent folks won't even stop and talk.
Oh, Daddy, don't be so paranoid.
Hey, soldier, got that radar up yet?
It's not radar, pop.
It's a satellite dish, you know a TV receiver.
Satellite, you say?
I wonder if it could pick up recon satellites?
Keep track of enemy troop movements.
It might be a handy little addition to my home defense unit.
[ray gun sound]
Holy tomato.
Ahh!
Brain shot!
Belly down, soldier, the geeks aren't through with you yet!
Bam!
Bam!
Bam!
Hey, hey, hey, would you guys grow up?
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Sherm.
I gotcha, Grampa.
Captured your radar too.
Hell of an assault, soldier!
Damn fine show of fire power.
Say, Mr. P, you mind if I grab another Heinie?
Look, Norton, if you're gonna hang out and guzzle my Heinies, the least you could do is give me a hand here.
Sorry, Mr. P., the contract says repairs only.
[bang] You want repairs?
- I'll show you repairs!
- Mr. Putterman.
There!
Now let's talk repairs!
[thunderclap]
Je-sus!
What the hell was that?
Man, I've never seen anything like that before.
Stanley, what is going on?
What the heck was that noise?
Where's my workout show?
[TV sounds]
Hey-hey, Mr. Putterman, check it out.
[Spanish broadcast]
All right, Putterman.
What a guy.
[Stanley] Get ready, you guys.
This baby is going to open a whole new dimension in television pleasure.
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, Stanley, I'm so excited.
[beeps] [raucous laughter]
Check it out!
Dyno-picture.
Hey, nice one, Dad.
Oh, très impressimo.
[chuckles] Pleasure palace, here we come.
Troop movements, leave it here.
No way!

You're gonna break it, careful, watch it!
What the hell?
[screaming]
Gosh, that coulda burned down the whole house!
Stanley, you call Norton right this second!
No, no, no, look.
It's fine, it's workin' fine, it's cool.

Oh boy, Medusa.
Hello, bloodsuckers.
Ready to be turned to stone?
Will you look at those hooters?
Holy tomato!
Let's watch her tonight, okay, Grampa?
All the way to midnight.
Hell yeah, we'll watch her.
What about brain rot, Dad?
The intellectual conspiracy?
I've said it before and I'll say it again, war stories and monster movies are educational.
They're survival oriented.
They always neutralize the enemy in the end.
[doorbell rings]
I'll get it, it's OD.
O who?
OD, my new boyfriend.
Oh, Irish boy?
New boyfriend, what happened to the Weinstein boy?
Squidsville, Mommy, gaa!
OD's the coolest boy in school, he's a musical genius.
Okay, invite him in and let's see what he looks like.

I'm glad we're finally gettin' a chance to meet.
[mumbles]
Hello, Mrs. Putterman, mm-mm, beautiful outfit.
Why thank you, OD.
You're sweet.
Mom, can we use the Jacuzzi tonight?
Uh, not tonight, baby.
Your father and I might be swinging.
Stanley, we have to meet them at the Cha-Cha Room at eight.
Oh, I gotta hit that ol' locker room pronto.
Nice meeting you, OD.
Don't stay out too late.
Oh, no, we won't.
Well, it was nice meeting you, sir.
Hey, no problem... dude.
Just take care of my little girl.
[laughs] Okay.
- Yeah.
- What dress you wearin', babe?
- Oh, my new Naugahyde.
- Oww!
- Woo!

I'll just get my junk and I'll be right back, okay?
- No sweat.

Hey, old dude, whatcha eatin', man?
Lizard tail jerky.
Wanna stick?
[chuckles]
No thanks, man, I just pigged out.
Amazing creature, the lizard.
Ya eat the tail, it don't give a hoot.
Just grows another one.
And ya eat it too.
It's mighty darn tasty.
Hey, little dude, you into metal?
Kiss the boot, man.
Kiss the ass, bozo.
Jesus, could you believe that kid?
Oh, I thought he was kinda cute.

Medusa's been getting a lot of fan mail lately.
Hey, listen, I called that TV guy, Norton.
He's gonna come by a little later and check out the dish.
If it starts acting up again, just turn it off until he gets here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go on, go on, get outta here.

I'd nuke that sucker!

[grunting]
Well, do something, you ugly bastard!
Man, this is the dumbest movie I ever saw.
What a bunch a crud.
All you phone freaks out there stay tuned.
Oh, boy!
We're gonna open up the call lines to see what you perverts are up to.

Great balls of fire!
Did you see somethin', boy?
You know what the Sam Hill it was?
It-it looked like a-- a monster.
There's no such thing as monsters, boy!
It was a God dang burglar!
Let's move out!
It looked... weird.
Sometimes them burglars wear Hallyween masks.
They scare the poop outta ya.
You get the jackets, I'll break out the fire power.
Survival ranger's first priority is defend the home unit.
- You got that, boy?
- Yes, sir!
Remember what I taught you about the 30-round magazine, boy?
I remember, Grampa.
All right, boy, let's go!
[doorbell rings]
Come on, Mr. Putterman.
I don't have all night here.
Remember boy, best way to stop the enemy-- brain shot!
What a tool job.
Stan, the man.
Put, the putz.
Can't even get a Heinie for the road.
[bangs]
Did you hear that?
I'll be a God danged son of a gun!
They're stealin' the radar.
What the hey?
[cocking] Stay right where you are!
Hey, guys?
It's me, Norton.
Remember, Norton, the satellite guy.
What the heck are you doin' out here?
Hey, no problem, sir.
Uh, Mr. Putterman called me to come check out the dish.
I rang the front bell, but nobody was home.
We thought we saw a burglar.
Did you see anyone?
No, not me, guy.
You wouldn't by any chance have one a them
Hallyween masks in there, would ya?
Uh, listen, old fella, I'm just here to check out the dish.
So, if you don't mind, I'll get back to work.
All right, boy, let's go recon the house.
Mmm.
Damn, I hate these do-it-yourself 100s.
I'll scout the den, you stay put.
- Keep the front door covered.
- I'm goin' with you.
Stay put, soldier, remember your chain of command.
Yes, sir.
Grampa?
You okay?
A-OK, little buddy.
God amighty, Mr. Putterman, this is disgusting.
Gotta keep these electronics clean, nut!

Grampa, did ya hear that?
Say what, little buddy?
A scream.
Something weird.

Hello, I need the police.
[male] Police department, Officer Nutky speaking.
Hello, police?
Who's calling, please?
My grampa, I mean a monster.
I mean the TV.
I mean-
- Sherman Putterman.
Now, Sherman, are you aware that what you're doing is a criminal offense?
Huh?
There's a law against prank phone calls.
No, really, I swear there's a monster on TV.
It ate Grampa and the TV guy.
Now listen here, Sherman Putterman,
I'd come out and arrest your ass, but lucky for you
I've got some real police emergencies to attend to.
No, please, wait!
[tires squeal]
Ha-ha.
Hey, let's go!
[chuckles]
- Come on babe, ha-ha.
- Come on, come on.
[giggles] Voila.
[French accent] Chez Putterman.
Otherwise known as the Pleasure Zone.
[chuckles]
Wow, you really got a sensuous-type place here.
[Greek accent] So regal, so magnificent, and so isolated from the city.
That's what we love about it.
Yeah, it's kind of a nature trip.
Puts you in touch with the, uh, real you.
The cities are so nasty these days.
Don't you think?
Absolutely-- the cesspools of civilization.
We much prefer to live on the yacht.
Yeah.
Uh, say, babe, you know, I think I better check on Norton.
See how he's doin' with that satellite dish.
Excuse me.
Oh, is he gonna be joining us?
- Sherman!
- Mom.
Grampa... a monster!
For Chrissake, he's having another one of his attacks.
Sherman, wake up Sherman, you're dreaming.
No, really, it's in the TV!
Um, Stanley, why don't you show Spiro and Cherry around.
I'll just be a minute.
Good idea.
Maybe we should leave.
Oh, no, no, don't you dare, no, he just needs a pill.
[giggles] Now, go on, go on, have fun.
Please.
[chuckles]
What are you doing out of bed, Sherman Putterman!
The Pleasure Den.
Wow, this place is like, really... awesome!
- Art collectors, eh?
- Oh, hell, yeah.
Listen, I know a place where you can get all this stuff real cheap.
All right, Norton!
Hey, Norton!
Looking good, guy!
Norton?
Hey, uh, listen, I'd invite you in for a beer or somethin', but we got company now, so take off, okay?
I'll check with ya later.
'Preciate it, babe.
He's a cool guy.
Service seven days a week.
Handles only the best.
But hey... on to the Pleasure Dome.
To the Pleasure Dome.
- Mom, please listen to me!
- Sherman Putterman,
I'm gonna slap you silly!
Why do you have to pull this when we have company?
Who left the TV on?
No, Mom, there's a monster.
Sherman, you're not gonna make me call Dr. Silverman, are you?
Mom, look.
[gasps] Sherman, what have you done?
That's where Grampa was.
Uchh!
What a mess!
[coughs]
It killed him and the TV guy.
Honestly, I cannot leave you two alone an hour without some kind of disaster!

Wow, now, this is what I call romantic.
Magnificent architecture--

I got this baby wired.
State of the art.
This satellite receiver pulls in the weirdest stuff from all over the world.
Hey, what is this movie?
Huh?
What is-- what is this movie?
I think I read for a part in it one time.
Bunch a creeps!
[TV] People of Earth, you must heed my warning.
Destroy your satellite receivers.
- Great sound, huh?
- Dismantle your communication systems.
Render your television sets inoperable for the next 200 Earth years.
It may already be too late.
Uh, I don't know, it looks kinda like that Japanese thing-- uh, you know, whatchamacallit-- you know, where the Martians steal all the Earth women and knock 'em up.
Yeah, you know, to-- to repopulate Mars.
- Ahh!
- Hey, that sounds kinky.
Is that hard core?
Fantastic idea for a movie--
Martians diddling the women of the universe.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got it, Spiro-- intergalactic swingers.
[growls]
Dad?
Are you decent?
Hold your God dang horses, I'm changing in here!
See?
It was all a dream!
No, Grampa's dead!
Oh, Sherman!
Home so soon?
I'm just takin' care of business here.
Everything okay, Dad?
Okay?
Yeah, I guess so.
Everything A-OK with you?
There's a big mess in the den, Dad.
Do you know anything about it?
Mess?
[chuckles]
I don't know anything about a mess, dear.
It musta been Sherman.
I'm just takin' care of business.
Get to bed, young man!
We will talk about this in the morning!
No, Mom, really!
Something weird's going on, I swear!
Sherman Putterman, I am fed up!
If you're too big of a sissy to spend the night alone, then you'll just spend the night with Grampa!
- No, Mom, no, Mom!
- Get in there!
Get in!
Dad, is it all right if Sherman spends the night with you?
Mom, please let me out!
Come on, Mom.
Please, I swear I'll be good, Mom.
Just let me out, please Mom.
I won't mention the monster, Mom.
Let me out, please, I swear I'll be good!
Pleasant dreams, you two.
- [knocking] Come on, Mom, please?
- Good night.
I swear I'll be good!
Grampa?
Grampa, where are you?
Grampa, are you planning a surprise attack?
Grampa?
I hear you, Grampa.
Come outta there.
Or I'll open up on ya.
- There.
- [Stanley] Hey, babe.
- [Spiro] Ah, Raquel.
- That didn't take long, did it?
I didn't miss anything... exciting?
Oh, Stanley was just showing us the wonders of satellite TV.
He's a real video pilot, eh?
I just really love your house here.
It's so-
- I don't know, it's kinda-- kinda weird.
Yeah, thank you.
We did it ourselves.
Hey, babe, is everything cool with Sherm?
He's in with Dad, doin' terrific.
You know, you really got a cute kid there.
Have you ever thought about putting him in the movies?
I mean, I know a really sweet agent.
Oh, God no.
Sherman's much too neurotic to be an actor.
Yeah, the only thing the kid is interested in is being a soldier.
Oh, such a manly pursuit-- raping and pillaging, creating life and taking it away, like the Gods of the ancient Greeks.
Well, hey, guy,
I mean, I'm a lover not a fighter.
[chuckles] Comprende?
Uh, Spiro, why don't you come help me make the drinks?
Excellent idea.
I make a wonderful margarita.
Very unusual.
Go for it!
Raquel, do you have ouzo?
Uh, no, I don't even know what it is.
Too bad, I make a delicious ouzo margarita.
So, uh... here we are.
Yeah.
Is it cool if I get in there?
Cool?
Babe, it's a perfect 98.6.
It's like floatin' in your mother's womb.
Cool?
Hey, go for it.
That's what it's there for.
Okay.
Holy tomatoes.
Oh [giggles], it tickles.
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.
I just gotta change my clothes.
[chuckles]
Eh, look, whatever you do, don't touch this.
There's something screwy with the waterproofing and uh, well, I wouldn't want you to get electrocuted.
[giggles] Me neither.
Hurry back?
In a flash.
Oh, man that bikini is dynamite.
[growling]
What are you looking at, you creep?
So, tell me, Raquel, how long have you and Stanley been swinging?
[chuckles] Well, to tell you the truth, we've only tried it a couple a times.
It's so hard to meet nice people through the classifieds.
Oh, I know exactly what you mean.
One never knows what one is getting into.
But you and Cherry, you're so sweet-- regular folk.
Stanley's such a fascinating fellow.
A real renaissance man.
[laughs] Definitely.
He's got a really high IQ.

People of Earth, please heed my warning.
A terrible accident has occurred.
I am Pluthar, sanitation captain of the planet Pluton.
A stray energy beam containing garbage from my substation may be headed for your solar system and could possibly result in the total annihilation of your species.
I'm so terribly sorry for the inconvenience.
I went to my hair dresser today to have my hair ratted.
You like?
Oh, it's really something to see.
We use live rats, you know.
Snakes just eat 'em up.
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

Whatta you know?
It's time for all you phone freaks out there to give us a call.
Share your darkest hearts.
Meanwhile, back to Attack... of the something or other.
[rings]
Me, here, who's there?
Is-- is this Medusa?
[sighs] Well, who's it sound like, kid, Count Dracula?
What's your name, I said.
Well, this is Sherman.
And I have this problem and nobody believes me.
Oh, well, maybe I won't believe you either.
Let's hear it.
Grampa and me, we were sleeping.
And then we woke up, and there was this monster.
And Grampa thought it was a burglar.
And then we saw the TV guy.
And then Grampa disappeared and the monster went inside the TV.
Then Mom came home and locked me in the bomb shelter.
So, tell me, Sherman, currently under psychiatric care?
No, really!
Sorry, Sherman, time's up.
[sighs]
Sherman?
Come here, Sherman.
Come real close to Medusa.
All set, Sherman?
This one's for you, babe.
[roars] [yells]
Pleasant dreams, kiddies.
So, tell me, Raquel, is Stanley a manly man?
Oh, God, yes.
A real stallion.
No, what I mean is, does Stanley take it like a man?
Oh, yeah.
I guess so.
I thought so.
And what about you, Spiro?
Are you a real manly man?
Oh, yes, indeed.
Spiro Xeros is the manliest of men.
Spiro... do you think that maybe I could have a little sneak preview?
Mmm?
Hey, Raquel, has there been some misunderstanding?
Whatta ya mean?
Well, I'm Greek, you know?
Oh, of course, you're Greek.
It said so in the classifieds.
Oh, don't worry, we're not prejudice.
No, no, no, you don't understand.
I am into Greek.
Greek culture.
I like boys.
Stanley is such a manly man.
Oh, my God, Stanley's never gonna believe this.
Spiro, how's my main man?
Ahh, Stanley, how marvelous you look.
- An old family recipe.
- Oh.
Whoa, whatta ya got in here, Spiro?
Rocket fuel?
Gettin' ready to, uh, blast off?
Stanley, uh--
Spiro, why don't you take Cherry her drink?
We'll join you in a few seconds.
Excellent idea.
See you soon, eh, tiger?
You bet, guy.
Yassoo!
[chuckles]
- Down the hatch.
- Yeah, mud in your eye.
So, uh, whatta ya think?
You like 'em?
Uh, well, now, look, they're very nice.
- But--
- Yeah, yeah, lookin' good too, huh?
Are we gonna swing or what?
Ahh, you look so serene, my darling.
Like Cleopatra on the Nile.
That Stanley-- hot stuff, huh?
Oh.
A little warm, don't you think?
Ahh!
Yechh, what is this, algae?
Ahh, maybe it's a sex lubricant, huh?
You are so beautiful.
How 'bout a quickie, huh?
A little aperitif, eh?
Just a quick little suck, eh?
[crunch] [groans]
Well, just gonna have to straighten out old Spiro about the facts a life.
Now, Stanley, don't get belligerent.
Yeah, yeah, yes.
Stanley.
Listen, Spiro, we gotta work something out, pal.
Where are they?
Spiro?
Cherry?
What the hell did that homo do to the Jacooz?
Maybe Spiro's cocktail made someone sicky-poo.
- Stanley?
- Yeah!
Stanley, it looks like something's in there.
[bubbling]
[Stanley] No, I hope they didn't electrocute themselv- [growling]
- Wait a minute.
[growling]
What is that?
No, no, no.

Mom!
Dad!
Police department, Officer Nutky speaking.
Hello, this is Sherman again.
There's really a monster, it's eating Mom and Dad.
Please, help me!
I warned you about this, son.
You are in a helluva heap a trouble.
Screw you!

Where's the party?

Oh!

Yeah, like 3.5 on the Richter scale.

Army dude, what are you doin' up this late?
Sherman, are Mom and Dad home yet?
Sis, stay here.
Somethin' weird's goin' on.
Sherman?
What are you doing?
There's a monster loose.
It ate Grampa.
I think it just ate Mom and Dad.
Honestly, Sherman, sometimes you are such a nerd!
Sis, don't go in there.
Sherman, stop it!
Yeah, buzz off, dude, I wanna party.
Are Mom and Dad home yet?
They were here, some other people too.
The monster got 'em.
Sherman, will you shut up about the monster?
I'm gonna make you take your pills.
Pills, what color?
Follow me.
All right, dude, pill freak.
Don't worry, he'll be asleep in five minutes.
He has these attacks sometimes.
It's like sleepwalking or something.
So, what's the deal, Sherm?
Where's the big monster?
Shh-hh.
Where's Mom and Dad?
Where's Gramps?
[fart sound]
[grunting]
Whoa, man, puke city!
P-U!
Sherman, did you do this?
Careful, you geek, that thing's loaded!
Sherman, gimme that, butt-hole!
No, there's more in the bomb shelter!
Follow me.
Come on!
Be right back, okay, baby?
No sweat.
Hey, what's on el tubo?
[no sound]
Mom?
Dad?
Are you there?
[grunting and growling]
Hi, kids.
Cherry, Spiro, these are the kids.
- Hi.
- Yassoo.
Remember, kids, you do your thing, we do ours.
Mother, that is so disgusting!
Night-night, now, kids.
Try and keep it down, will ya?
Thanks.
[whispers] Barf me out!
Have any of you seen Gramps?
Right here, honeybee.
Just takin' care a business.
Oh, Gramps, that is totally sicko!
[sighs]
I thought it was a monster.
That's okay, Sherman.
Some day you'll understand.
Earthlings, please, you must heed my warning.
Its appetite is insatiable.
Its curiosity is boundless.
Its strength knows no limits.
It will continue to absorb all life forms.
Sherman, will you please buzz now?
Go to bed or something, we wanna hang out.
Hey, dig this stupid movie.
It's just this one dude talking.
Earthlings, please, you must heed my warning.
That guy, he's talking about the monster!
Would you shut up about the monster!
Go to bed!
There are no such things as monsters!
... mutating endlessly until your planet is a barren wasteland--
Whoa, psychedelic!
There it is, the monster!
[growls]
Whoa.
Whoa!
Run dude!
[screams]
Don't shoot me, dude!
[screams]
[growls]
No, no!
No!
Get away!
No!
[whimpers]
OD, get away.
Yeah.
Stay, dude.
Stay.
[whispers] Whoa.
[monster whimpers]
Wow, a real, live monster.
I told you.
[OD] Did you see that?
He looked right at my studs and cooled out.
This dude's into metal!
[sighs] He's so barfy.
He is not.
He's cool.
Oh, this is too rude!
Hey, you guys, remember that movie?
You know, the one about the little space guy.
Made you cry like a butt-hole?
E.T., stupid.
Yeah.
Okay, stand back, guys.
Careful, baby.
[OD] Okay.
Easy, dude.
Okay, dude.
Easy, now, big monster dude.
[giggles] Come on now.
[growls]
Whoa!
Easy, dude.
All right!
- Rad!
- Totally awesome!
[monster grunts]
Food, this is called food.
It's good for you, yum, yum.
Check it out, dude.
Mm-mm, good.
[squeals]
Food, mm-mm, see?
It's good for you.
Like vegetables.
Mother says, "Eat your vegetables."
Food, food.
Food.
- Food, food, food.
- Food.
Come on, dude, spit it out.
Food, say it.
Food.
Yeah, that's it, right!
- Why, it can talk!
- All right, nice one, dude!
Oh, yeah, here, here, try some!
Go ahead, dude, pig out.
[squeals]
This is music.
Mu-sic.
It's almost as important as food.
[pop instrumental plays]
Ooh, bad tune, dude.
Don't ever listen to that kinda music.
Rots your brain.
Now, this is my band.
I wrote this song.
[blares heavy metal] Bitchin', huh?
Ha-ha!
All right, dude, metal!
[growling]
Okay, I'm OD.
O-D.
D-O.
O-D.
OD, man.
All right, man, this is incredible.
Lemme try.
Hi, monster.
I'm Suzy.
Su-zy.
Suzy.
[squeals] Wow, he's cute.
I don't believe this.
Move over, it's my turn.
Okay, monster-
- Sherman.
I'm Sherman.
Sherman.
Say it.
Sherman.
- Sher, Sher, Sher, Sher--
- Yeah, Sherman.
Sherman!
This is TV.
T-V.
Next to food and music, this is mankind's greatest invention.
Watch.
I had a date the other night.
Poor fella.
I turned all the lights off and I whispered to him,
"Whatever you do, honey, don't look at me.
One glance and you're hard as a rock."
Needless to say, the poor guy peeked.
Now you see why I have this thing for phone freaks.
Hey, guys, come here a minute.
Be right back, okay monster?
[monster coos]
What are we going to do with him?
We're gonna make a million bucks.
- Huh?
- Huh?
Don'tcha see, this is like, amazing.
I mean, a monster from outer space, like-- it's like we own him!
Oh, yeah, rude!
I mean, that guy probably doesn't even know what money is.
Hey, wait a minute, bozo.
Who said anything about you?
I'm the one who saw him first.
Grampa and me discovered him.
He came through our TV.
He's our property.
Hey, spud, I'm the one who communicated with him first.
He takes orders from me, so, watch it, dude.
Come on you guys.
Don't be so selfish.
Why can't he belong to all of us?
Yeah, come on, dude.
This is like... a miracle or something.
There'll be plenty of dough for all of us.
What about Mom and Dad?
Shouldn't we tell them?
Forget Mom and Dad, we don't have to share anything with them!
They wouldn't believe us anyway.
So, like, partners, okay?
Partners-- okay, Sherm?
I guess so.
Oh, cool, cool, you guys are really cool, man.
So... first thing...
I think... we have to get him on TV.
Well, it's time for Medusa's beauty sleep now, kiddies.
So, 'til next week,
Medusa hopes you have some real... wet... nightmares.
[laughs wickedly]
[Sherman] I know.
Medusa, maybe she'll help us.
Yeah, dude, she understands monsters.
Let's call her.
But no more partners, okay?
Here, let me do the talking.
No, I've already called her once tonight.
She knows me.
You told her about the monster?
Yeah, but she didn't believe me either.
- [monster] TV.
- Whoa!
Whatsa matter, dude?
TV.
[farts]
Whoa, I hope this guy's house trained.
[phone ringing]
Uh, for Chrissake, will somebody get me outta this thing?
Oh, Medusa, you were wonderful tonight.
You were absolutely brilliant.
Come on, come on, come on!
Hey, Al, uh, give me brew and, uh, give me a smoke.
Okay, I'll be right back.
All right, thanks, pal.
[phone rings]
Show's over, sucker.
Hello, Medusa, this is Sherman again, remember me?
Sherman?
The schizo.
Well, you know that monster I told you about?
He's really here.
We're teaching him to talk, me and my sister.
And me, man, OD Riley!
Well, listen, Sherman,
I've had a long night.
So, uh, call me next week, huh, we'll chat it up.
- But wait!
- [whispers] Let me!
Medusa?
Oh, who's this, your split personality?
This is Suzy Putterman, Sherman's sister.
Business manager for the monster from outer space.
So, tell me, Suzy, is your whole family a little cuckoo?
Please, Medusa, this is serious!
He's a real live monster!
We wanna know how to get him on TV.
Listen, kid, you want a guest spot, talk to the Letterman people.
Medusa's strictly solo.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta hit some parties.
Please, Medusa!
I'm sure if you saw him, you'd be interested.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, and we're having sort of a... party for him here, right now.
A real fun party.
Party, huh?
You could just come and take a look.
No obligation.
He's gonna be a big sensation.
He talks and everything.
If you don't help us, someone will.
Oh, yeah?
We're on Putterman Lane off Lonesome Canyon, at the end of the road.
Well, like I said, kid, I got some other parties to hit.
So, uh, don't count on me anytime soon.
Uh, bye, now.
[dial tone] [slams phone]
- She coming?
- Who knows?
- She had a crummy attitude.
- Hmm.
[growling]
TV, TV.
That's okay, guy, there's always somethin' else on.
That's what's so cool about TV.
[beep]
TV!
[growls insistently]
Hey, hold your horses, turkey.
What are you doing?
Hey, man, nothing.
This guy just doesn't dig commercials.
Be careful, you guys.
He wants music.
Shh, come on now, be quiet, okay?
Yeah, dude, don't be so impatient, butt-hole.
What's your name?
What planet are you from?
[growls]
He doesn't know what you're talking about.
He's just a monster.
[doorbell rings]
I'll get it.
It's her already?
No way!
Hey, hey don't let any strangers in.
I have a warrant here for the arrest of Sherman Putterman.
Huh?
Hi, guy.
Hi, monster.
Hi, monster.
[beep]
Hey, it's that same dude again.
... too late.
It's appetite is uncontrollable.
The slightest excitement can trigger a monstrous eating binge.
I bet you anything he's talking about the monster.
[growls excitedly]
I am your friend, Pluthar.
[incessant growling]
Hey, hey, cool it!
We're, uh, having a little, uh, party.
Hey, hey!
Hey, I said shut up, butt-hole!
- Oh, my God!
- All right, get back, lady!
- Oh!
- Sis, sis!
- Oh!
- Sis, run quick!
- Freeze, son, you're under arrest.
- [Suzy screams]
Hey, hey!
Hey, you kids, come back here!
You come outta there or I'm gonna come in after you.
Damn you, kids, you-- [growling]
[groans]
[roars] [yells]
What happened?
Saw that space guy on TV.
Went crazy!
Where's OD?
It ate him.
Oh, my God!
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna blow his butt to kingdom come.
Huh?
First, secure the perimeter.
Sherman?
I'm calling the cops.
Second, break out the fire power.
Doo-doo, they cut off our phone!
Sherman, have you been making prank calls again?
Here, best chance to stop him is a brain shot.
What are you talking about?
We don't even know where his brain is!
This is so stupid, Sherman.
This is like, totally disgusting!
Let's split, we can use that cop's radio.
No, gotta evacuate Mom and Dad first.
Wow, these grenades are pretty neat.
Maybe I killed it already.
Didn't sound too dead when it ate that cop.
Yeah, well, maybe I wounded it.
OD!
Oh!
Gross!
Sis, get back!
Oh!
[Suzy] Mom?
Dad?
You guys in here?
Mommy?
Are you okay?
[screams]
It ate them!
[monster singing]
[grunts in awe]
[whispering] Sherman, let's get out of here!
[Sherman] Perfect setup for a surprise attack.
Attack?
I'm so sure!
The hand grenade didn't even phase him!
[whispering] I've got an idea.
Huh?
Cover me.
Be careful!
[grunts in surprise]
Hi, monster.
It's me,
Sherman.
Boy--
[yells]
Attack!
Attack!
Sis, the remote on the wall-- throw it in the water!
Now, throw it!
Throw it!
[monster groans] [squeals]
Let's get outta here, Sherman!
[screams]
Sis, stop!
Earth children, please, I mean you no harm.
I am Pluthar, here to save you.
Hey, it's the space guy from TV.
Whatta you want from us?
Please, Earthling, there is little time.
I've come to exterminate the hungry beast.
Like, what is going on around here?
What is the hungry beast?
On my planet, the hungry beast is a house pet, similar to your earthly dogs and cats.
But they are highly unstable, prone to mutate wildly and eat everything in sight.
When mutation occurs, they must be exterminated at once.
You mean, like... he was somebody's pet?
Oh, yes.
They're very lovable before they mutate.
Okay, but like, how did it get here?
In our house?
In the extermination process, they are converted to pure energy, beamed to the farthest reaches of the universe.
It's really a very safe form of waste disposal.
Yeah, but like, what did it do with Mommy and Daddy?
- And OD and Gramps?
- And the TV guy?
The beast has ingested Earthlings?
Oh, dear, heavens,
I'll lose my position for this.
Who cares about your stupid position, what about them?
Well... we do have a process.
If I can take the beast back alive, which isn't likely, the victim's genes could be extracted from the hungry beast's tissue and grown in special serum cultures.
You mean, like, clones?
Clones of Mommy and Daddy?
No, no, they'd be the real Mommy and Daddy.
Of course, they'd have to live in special aquariums.
[police radio chatter]
Come on, come on, come on, chee!
Right, neighbors already calling' the cops.
Oh, now this looks like a happening party.
Yeah.
[owl hoots]
Messy crowd.
What?
Please, children, lay down your weapons and take me to the beast.
Very well, let's go.
Son of a bitch!
Medusa!
Not so fast, asshole!
Yah!
Ugly bastard!
Uh.
I'm... losing... pressure!
Ooh!
Oh, my God!
Right in the nick of time, huh?
You killed him!
Spaceman, spaceman, please don't die!
Hey, what's with you guys?
I just saved your ass!
How 'bout a little gratitude?
You killed him!
You killed him, you stupid bitch!
It was our only hope!
Huh?
Hey, what are you guys, nuts?
Hey, I'm history, man, I'm outta here.
[growling]
[screams]
Shoot him, Sherman, shoot him!
[click]
Shoot him, Sherman, shoot him!
[click]
Come on, kid, blast him!
[click]
- I can't, it won't work!
- [screams]
Shoot that gun!
That's it, I'm outta here!
[screams]
[yelling] [screams]
[yells]
[birds chirping]
[crows caw]
The studio, Al, and make it snappy!
Come on, come on, come on!
Stanley, Stanley, quit screwing' around!
Stanley!
Stanley, I'm right in the middle of my program!
For Chrissake, Stanley!
Lay off me, beautiful, I almost got this baby wired.
Yeah... it's gonna be... dynamite.
Whoa!
Hey, my TV flipped out.
I missed the new Noodles video.
Earth Station Putterman is at it again.
Oh, Daddy.
- ...but I think it's okay.
- I think this thing is a piece of--
He's such a dork.
He thinks he's a genius, what can you do?
Oh, I'll get it.
And one and two.
Hi, Gramps!
Hey, honeybee.
You know the one about the U-2s?
- Uh, the band?
- No, the spy planes.
Oh, yeah, I think I saw 'em on MTV.
MTV?
Phooey!
Je-sus!
What's with this thing, Norton, I'm gettin' electrocuted here?
I tried to warn you, Mr. P.
These do-it-yourself 100s are kinda temperamental.
Yeah, gimme a break guy, I need a hand here.
Sorry, Mr. Putterman, no can do.
The warranty covers repairs only.
You insisted on the 100, Mr. P.
I told you they were trouble.
Yeah?
Well, when I get through with her, she's gonna be the hottest dish in town.
...four, five, six, seven, eight.
one, two three...
Hi Dad, how was downtown today?
Downtown, phooey!
I'm sick a downtown.
Used to be the place to go, talk to people, disseminate your literature-- feel like you were doin' some good in the world.
Now it's just bums and weirdos and kooks coming out of the woodwork.
Getting so decent folks won't even stop and talk.
Oh, Daddy, don't be so paranoid.
Hey, soldier, got that radar up yet?
It's not radar, pop.
It's a satellite dish, you know a TV receiver.
Satellite, you say?
I wonder if it could pick up recon satellites?
Keep track of enemy troop movements.
It might be a handy little addition to my home defense unit.
Holy tomato.
Ahh!
Brain shot!
Belly down, soldier, the geeks aren't through with you yet!
Bam!
Bam!
Bam!
Hey, hey, hey, would you guys grow up?
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Sherm.
I gotcha, Grampa.
Captured your radar too.
Hell of an assault, soldier!
Damn fine show of fire power.
Say, Mr. P, you mind if I grab another Heinie?
Look, Norton, if you're gonna hang out and guzzle my Heinies, the least you could do is give me a hand here.
Sorry, Mr. P., the contract says repairs only.
You want repairs?
- I'll show you repairs!
- Mr. Putterman.
There!
Now let's talk repairs!
Je-sus!
What the hell was that?
Man, I've never seen anything like that before.
Stanley, what is going on?
What the heck was that noise?
Where's my workout show?
Hey-hey, Mr. Putterman, check it out.
All right, Putterman.
What a guy.
Get ready, you guys.
This baby is going to open a whole new dimension in television pleasure.
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, Stanley, I'm so excited.
Check it out!
Dyno-picture.
Hey, nice one, Dad.
Oh, très impressimo.
Pleasure palace, here we come.
Troop movements, leave it here.
No way!
Channel 69, Pop.
Stanley!
This is grungy!
Where's MTV?
MTV?
No problem.
♪ I'm a liar and I'm a cheat ♪
Leave it, leave it, I love this song!
Echh!
He is so nasty.
Intellectual decay!
Turn it off, it'll rot your brain cells.
It's the international conspiracy!
Hey, hey, hey, careful, you're gonna break it.
You're gonna break it, careful, watch it!
What the hell?
Gosh, that coulda burned down the whole house!
Stanley, you call Norton right this second!
No, no, no, look.
It's fine, it's workin' fine, it's cool.
Oh boy, Medusa.
Hello, bloodsuckers.
Ready to be turned to stone?
Will you look at those hooters?
Holy tomato!
Let's watch her tonight, okay, Grampa?
All the way to midnight.
Hell yeah, we'll watch her.
What about brain rot, Dad?
The intellectual conspiracy?
I've said it before and I'll say it again, war stories and monster movies are educational.
They're survival oriented.
They always neutralize the enemy in the end.
I'll get it, it's OD.
O who?
OD, my new boyfriend.
Oh, Irish boy?
New boyfriend, what happened to the Weinstein boy?
Squidsville, Mommy, gaa!
OD's the coolest boy in school, he's a musical genius.
Okay, invite him in and let's see what he looks like.
OD!
Da-da-da-da-da-da, charge!
Ya gotta come in.
My parents wanna meet you.
Oh, wow, what a drag.
♪ Ta-da. ♪
Everybody, this is OD.
Hello, Mr. Putterman,
I'm glad we're finally gettin' a chance to meet.
Hello, Mrs. Putterman, mm-mm, beautiful outfit.
Why thank you, OD.
You're sweet.
Mom, can we use the Jacuzzi tonight?
Uh, not tonight, baby.
Your father and I might be swinging.
Stanley, we have to meet them at the Cha-Cha Room at eight.
Oh, I gotta hit that ol' locker room pronto.
Nice meeting you, OD.
Don't stay out too late.
Oh, no, we won't.
Well, it was nice meeting you, sir.
Hey, no problem... dude.
Just take care of my little girl.
Okay.
- Yeah.
- What dress you wearin', babe?
- Oh, my new Naugahyde.
- Oww!
- Woo!
- Killer!
I'll just get my junk and I'll be right back, okay?
No sweat.
Hey, old dude, whatcha eatin', man?
Lizard tail jerky.
Wanna stick?
No thanks, man, I just pigged out.
Amazing creature, the lizard.
Ya eat the tail, it don't give a hoot.
Just grows another one.
And ya eat it too.
It's mighty darn tasty.
Hey, little dude, you into metal?
Kiss the boot, man.
Kiss the ass, bozo.
Jesus, could you believe that kid?
Oh, I thought he was kinda cute.
That punk stuff is just a phase anyway.
Yeah, I know, but don't they know how ridiculous they look?
Puny, puny earthlings,
I, Ro-Man, am your new master.
Worship my superior intelligence or I shall wipe you from the face of the planet.
Uh, give us a break, Ro-Man.
Lose the deep-sea helmet, guy, and quit monkeying around.
Medusa's been getting a lot of fan mail lately.
Hey, listen, I called that TV guy, Norton.
He's gonna come by a little later and check out the dish.
If it starts acting up again, just turn it off until he gets here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go on, go on, get outta here.
...words from our sponsors.
Announcing Super Television, with a picture so lifelike, it comes right out into your living room.
Pretty good old movie, ain't it?
No.
Let's see what's up with the recon satellites.
...superior, the winning television you--
Careful, Grampa!
What the Sam Hill?
Watch out, Grampa, you're gonna break it again!
Hey, this looks like a cool movie.
Hey, he's a gross lookin' booger, ain't he?
I'd nuke that sucker!
Well, do something, you ugly bastard!
Man, this is the dumbest movie I ever saw.
What a bunch a crud.
All you phone freaks out there stay tuned.
Oh, boy!
We're gonna open up the call lines to see what you perverts are up to.
And Medusa wants to hear wants to hear some real... kinky... nightmares.
Hmm?
Great balls of fire!
Did you see somethin', boy?
You know what the Sam Hill it was?
It-it looked like a-- a monster.
There's no such thing as monsters, boy!
It was a God dang burglar!
Let's move out!
It looked... weird.
Sometimes them burglars wear Hallyween masks.
They scare the poop outta ya.
You get the jackets, I'll break out the fire power.
Survival ranger's first priority is defend the home unit.
- You got that, boy?
- Yes, sir!
Remember what I taught you about the 30-round magazine, boy?
I remember, Grampa.
All right, boy, let's go!
Come on, Mr. Putterman.
I don't have all night here.
Remember boy, best way to stop the enemy-- brain shot!
What a tool job.
Stan, the man.
Put, the putz.
Can't even get a Heinie for the road.
Did you hear that?
I'll be a God danged son of a gun!
They're stealin' the radar.
What the hey?
Stay right where you are!
Hey, guys?
It's me, Norton.
Remember, Norton, the satellite guy.
What the heck are you doin' out here?
Hey, no problem, sir.
Uh, Mr. Putterman called me to come check out the dish.
I rang the front bell, but nobody was home.
We thought we saw a burglar.
Did you see anyone?
No, not me, guy.
You wouldn't by any chance have one a them
Hallyween masks in there, would ya?
Uh, listen, old fella, I'm just here to check out the dish.
So, if you don't mind, I'll get back to work.
All right, boy, let's go recon the house.
Mmm.
Damn, I hate these do-it-yourself 100s.
I'll scout the den, you stay put.
- Keep the front door covered.
- I'm goin' with you.
Stay put, soldier, remember your chain of command.
Yes, sir.
Grampa?
You okay?
A-OK, little buddy.
God amighty, Mr. Putterman, this is disgusting.
Gotta keep these electronics clean, nut!
Grampa, did ya hear that?
Say what, little buddy?
A scream.
Something weird.
I'll be right there, soldier.
Grampa!
Grampa!
Operator.
Hello, I need the police.
Police department, Officer Nutky speaking.
Hello, police?
Who's calling, please?
My grampa, I mean a monster.
I mean the TV.
I mean-
- Sherman Putterman.
Now, Sherman, are you aware that what you're doing is a criminal offense?
Huh?
There's a law against prank phone calls.
No, really, I swear there's a monster on TV.
It ate Grampa and the TV guy.
Now listen here, Sherman Putterman,
I'd come out and arrest your ass, but lucky for you
I've got some real police emergencies to attend to.
No, please, wait!
Ha-ha.
Hey, let's go!
- Come on babe, ha-ha.
- Come on, come on.
Voila.
Chez Putterman.
Otherwise known as the Pleasure Zone.
Wow, you really got a sensuous-type place here.
So regal, so magnificent, and so isolated from the city.
That's what we love about it.
Yeah, it's kind of a nature trip.
Puts you in touch with the, uh, real you.
The cities are so nasty these days.
Don't you think?
Absolutely-- the cesspools of civilization.
We much prefer to live on the yacht.
Yeah.
Uh, say, babe, you know, I think I better check on Norton.
See how he's doin' with that satellite dish.
Excuse me.
Oh, is he gonna be joining us?
- Sherman!
- Mom.
Grampa... a monster!
For Chrissake, he's having another one of his attacks.
Sherman, wake up Sherman, you're dreaming.
No, really, it's in the TV!
Um, Stanley, why don't you show Spiro and Cherry around.
I'll just be a minute.
Good idea.
Maybe we should leave.
Oh, no, no, don't you dare, no, he just needs a pill.
Now, go on, go on, have fun.
Please.
What are you doing out of bed, Sherman Putterman!
The Pleasure Den.
Wow, this place is like, really... awesome!
- Art collectors, eh?
- Oh, hell, yeah.
Listen, I know a place where you can get all this stuff real cheap.
All right, Norton!
Hey, Norton!
Looking good, guy!
Norton?
Hey, uh, listen, I'd invite you in for a beer or somethin', but we got company now, so take off, okay?
I'll check with ya later.
'Preciate it, babe.
He's a cool guy.
Service seven days a week.
Handles only the best.
But hey... on to the Pleasure Dome.
To the Pleasure Dome.
- Mom, please listen to me!
- Sherman Putterman,
I'm gonna slap you silly!
Why do you have to pull this when we have company?
Who left the TV on?
No, Mom, there's a monster.
Sherman, you're not gonna make me call Dr. Silverman, are you?
Mom, look.
Sherman, what have you done?
That's where Grampa was.
Uchh!
What a mess!
It killed him and the TV guy.
Honestly, I cannot leave you two alone an hour without some kind of disaster!

The Pleasure Dome.
Wow, now, this is what I call romantic.
Magnificent architecture--
Greek influenced?
Roman, guy, Roman all the way.
Hey, check it out--
I got this baby wired.
State of the art.
This satellite receiver pulls in the weirdest stuff from all over the world.
Hey, what is this movie?
Huh?
What is-- what is this movie?
I think I read for a part in it one time.
Bunch a creeps!
People of Earth, you must heed my warning.
Destroy your satellite receivers.
- Great sound, huh?
- Dismantle your communication systems.
Render your television sets inoperable for the next 200 Earth years.
It may already be too late.
Uh, I don't know, it looks kinda like that Japanese thing-- uh, you know, whatchamacallit-- you know, where the Martians steal all the Earth women and knock 'em up.
Yeah, you know, to-- to repopulate Mars.
- Ahh!
- Hey, that sounds kinky.
Is that hard core?
Fantastic idea for a movie--
Martians diddling the women of the universe.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got it, Spiro-- intergalactic swingers.
Dad?
Are you decent?
Hold your God dang horses, I'm changing in here!
See?
It was all a dream!
No, Grampa's dead!
Oh, Sherman!
Home so soon?
I'm just takin' care of business here.
Everything okay, Dad?
Okay?
Yeah, I guess so.
Everything A-OK with you?
There's a big mess in the den, Dad.
Do you know anything about it?
Mess?
I don't know anything about a mess, dear.
It musta been Sherman.
I'm just takin' care of business.
Get to bed, young man!
We will talk about this in the morning!
No, Mom, really!
Something weird's going on, I swear!
Sherman Putterman, I am fed up!
If you're too big of a sissy to spend the night alone, then you'll just spend the night with Grampa!
- No, Mom, no, Mom!
- Get in there!
Get in!
Dad, is it all right if Sherman spends the night with you?
Mom, please let me out!
Come on, Mom.
Please, I swear I'll be good, Mom.
Just let me out, please Mom.
I won't mention the monster, Mom.
Let me out, please, I swear I'll be good!
Pleasant dreams, you two.
- Come on, Mom, please?
- Good night.
I swear I'll be good!
Grampa?
Grampa, where are you?
Grampa, are you planning a surprise attack?
Grampa?
I hear you, Grampa.
Come outta there.
Or I'll open up on ya.
- There.
- Hey, babe.
- Ah, Raquel.
- That didn't take long, did it?
I didn't miss anything... exciting?
Oh, Stanley was just showing us the wonders of satellite TV.
He's a real video pilot, eh?
I just really love your house here.
It's so-
- I don't know, it's kinda-- kinda weird.
Yeah, thank you.
We did it ourselves.
Hey, babe, is everything cool with Sherm?
He's in with Dad, doin' terrific.
You know, you really got a cute kid there.
Have you ever thought about putting him in the movies?
I mean, I know a really sweet agent.
Oh, God no.
Sherman's much too neurotic to be an actor.
Yeah, the only thing the kid is interested in is being a soldier.
Oh, such a manly pursuit-- raping and pillaging, creating life and taking it away, like the Gods of the ancient Greeks.
Well, hey, guy,
I mean, I'm a lover not a fighter.
Comprende?
Uh, Spiro, why don't you come help me make the drinks?
Excellent idea.
I make a wonderful margarita.
Very unusual.
Go for it!
Raquel, do you have ouzo?
Uh, no, I don't even know what it is.
Too bad, I make a delicious ouzo margarita.
So, uh... here we are.
Yeah.
Is it cool if I get in there?
Cool?
Babe, it's a perfect 98.6.
It's like floatin' in your mother's womb.
Cool?
Hey, go for it.
That's what it's there for.
Okay.
Holy tomatoes.
Oh, it tickles.
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.
I just gotta change my clothes.
Eh, look, whatever you do, don't touch this.
There's something screwy with the waterproofing and uh, well, I wouldn't want you to get electrocuted.
Me neither.
Hurry back?
In a flash.
Oh, man that bikini is dynamite.
What are you looking at, you creep?
So, tell me, Raquel, how long have you and Stanley been swinging?
Well, to tell you the truth, we've only tried it a couple a times.
It's so hard to meet nice people through the classifieds.
Oh, I know exactly what you mean.
One never knows what one is getting into.
But you and Cherry, you're so sweet-- regular folk.
Stanley's such a fascinating fellow.
A real renaissance man.
Definitely.
He's got a really high IQ.
People of Earth, please heed my warning.
A terrible accident has occurred.
I am Pluthar, sanitation captain of the planet Pluton.
A stray energy beam containing garbage from my substation may be headed for your solar system and could possibly result in the total annihilation of your species.
I'm so terribly sorry for the inconvenience.
I went to my hair dresser today to have my hair ratted.
You like?
Oh, it's really something to see.
We use live rats, you know.
Snakes just eat 'em up.
Mm-mm, mm-mm.
Whatta you know?
It's time for all you phone freaks out there to give us a call.
Share your darkest hearts.
Meanwhile, back to Attack... of the something or other.
Me, here, who's there?
Is-- is this Medusa?
Well, who's it sound like, kid, Count Dracula?
What's your name, I said.
Well, this is Sherman.
And I have this problem and nobody believes me.
Oh, well, maybe I won't believe you either.
Let's hear it.
Grampa and me, we were sleeping.
And then we woke up, and there was this monster.
And Grampa thought it was a burglar.
And then we saw the TV guy.
And then Grampa disappeared and the monster went inside the TV.
Then Mom came home and locked me in the bomb shelter.
So, tell me, Sherman, currently under psychiatric care?
No, really!
Sorry, Sherman, time's up.
Sherman?
Come here, Sherman.
Come real close to Medusa.
All set, Sherman?
This one's for you, babe.
Pleasant dreams, kiddies.
So, tell me, Raquel, is Stanley a manly man?
Oh, God, yes.
A real stallion.
No, what I mean is, does Stanley take it like a man?
Oh, yeah.
I guess so.
I thought so.
And what about you, Spiro?
Are you a real manly man?
Oh, yes, indeed.
Spiro Xeros is the manliest of men.
Spiro... do you think that maybe I could have a little sneak preview?
Mmm?
Hey, Raquel, has there been some misunderstanding?
Whatta ya mean?
Well, I'm Greek, you know?
Oh, of course, you're Greek.
It said so in the classifieds.
Oh, don't worry, we're not prejudice.
No, no, no, you don't understand.
I am into Greek.
Greek culture.
I like boys.
Stanley is such a manly man.
Oh, my God, Stanley's never gonna believe this.
Spiro, how's my main man?
Ahh, Stanley, how marvelous you look.
- An old family recipe.
- Oh.
Whoa, whatta ya got in here, Spiro?
Rocket fuel?
Gettin' ready to, uh, blast off?
Stanley, uh--
Spiro, why don't you take Cherry her drink?
We'll join you in a few seconds.
Excellent idea.
See you soon, eh, tiger?
You bet, guy.
Yassoo!
- Down the hatch.
- Yeah, mud in your eye.
So, uh, whatta ya think?
You like 'em?
Uh, well, now, look, they're very nice.
- But--
- Yeah, yeah, lookin' good too, huh?
Are we gonna swing or what?
Ahh, you look so serene, my darling.
Like Cleopatra on the Nile.
That Stanley-- hot stuff, huh?
Oh.
A little warm, don't you think?
Ahh!
Yechh, what is this, algae?
Ahh, maybe it's a sex lubricant, huh?
You are so beautiful.
How 'bout a quickie, huh?
A little aperitif, eh?
Just a quick little suck, eh?
Well, just gonna have to straighten out old Spiro about the facts a life.
Now, Stanley, don't get belligerent.
Yeah, yeah, yes.
Stanley.
Listen, Spiro, we gotta work something out, pal.
Where are they?
Spiro?
Cherry?
What the hell did that homo do to the Jacooz?
Maybe Spiro's cocktail made someone sicky-poo.
- Stanley?
- Yeah!
Stanley, it looks like something's in there.
No, I hope they didn't electrocute themselv--
Wait a minute.
What is that?
No, no, no.
Mom!
Dad!
Police department, Officer Nutky speaking.
Hello, this is Sherman again.
There's really a monster, it's eating Mom and Dad.
Please, help me!
I warned you about this, son.
You are in a helluva heap a trouble.
Screw you!
Remember what I told you about explosives, boy-- blow your dang balls off!
Where's the party?
Oh!
Did you feel something?
Yeah, like 3.5 on the Richter scale.
Army dude, what are you doin' up this late?
Sherman, are Mom and Dad home yet?
Sis, stay here.
Somethin' weird's goin' on.
Sherman?
What are you doing?
There's a monster loose.
It ate Grampa.
I think it just ate Mom and Dad.
Honestly, Sherman, sometimes you are such a nerd!
Sis, don't go in there.
Sherman, stop it!
Yeah, buzz off, dude, I wanna party.
Are Mom and Dad home yet?
They were here, some other people too.
The monster got 'em.
Sherman, will you shut up about the monster?
I'm gonna make you take your pills.
Pills, what color?
Follow me.
All right, dude, pill freak.
Don't worry, he'll be asleep in five minutes.
He has these attacks sometimes.
It's like sleepwalking or something.
So, what's the deal, Sherm?
Where's the big monster?
Shh-hh.
Where's Mom and Dad?
Where's Gramps?
Whoa, man, puke city!
P-U!
Sherman, did you do this?
Careful, you geek, that thing's loaded!
Sherman, gimme that, butt-hole!
No, there's more in the bomb shelter!
Follow me.
Come on!
Be right back, okay, baby?
No sweat.
Hey, what's on el tubo?
Mom?
Dad?
Are you there?
Hi, kids.
Cherry, Spiro, these are the kids.
- Hi.
- Yassoo.
Remember, kids, you do your thing, we do ours.
Mother, that is so disgusting!
Night-night, now, kids.
Try and keep it down, will ya?
Thanks.
Barf me out!
Have any of you seen Gramps?
Right here, honeybee.
Just takin' care a business.
Oh, Gramps, that is totally sicko!
I thought it was a monster.
That's okay, Sherman.
Some day you'll understand.
Earthlings, please, you must heed my warning.
Its appetite is insatiable.
Its curiosity is boundless.
Its strength knows no limits.
It will continue to absorb all life forms.
Sherman, will you please buzz now?
Go to bed or something, we wanna hang out.
Hey, dig this stupid movie.
It's just this one dude talking.
Earthlings, please, you must heed my warning.
That guy, he's talking about the monster!
Would you shut up about the monster!
Go to bed!
There are no such things as monsters!
...mutating endlessly until your planet is a barren wasteland--
Whoa, psychedelic!
There it is, the monster!
Whoa.
Whoa!
Run dude!
Don't shoot me, dude!
No, no!
No!
Get away!
No!
OD, get away.
Yeah.
Stay, dude.
Stay.
Whoa.
Wow, a real, live monster.
I told you.
Did you see that?
He looked right at my studs and cooled out.
This dude's into metal!
He's so barfy.
He is not.
He's cool.
Oh, this is too rude!
Hey, you guys, remember that movie?
You know, the one about the little space guy.
Made you cry like a butt-hole?
E.T., stupid.
Yeah.
Okay, stand back, guys.
Careful, baby.
Okay.
Easy, dude.
Okay, dude.
Easy, now, big monster dude.
Come on now.
Whoa!
Easy, dude.
All right!
- Rad!
- Totally awesome!
Food, this is called food.
It's good for you, yum, yum.
Check it out, dude.
Mm-mm, good.
Food, mm-mm, see?
It's good for you.
Like vegetables.
Mother says, "Eat your vegetables."
Food, food.
Food.
- Food, food, food.
- Food.
Come on, dude, spit it out.
Food, say it.
Food.
Yeah, that's it, right!
- Why, it can talk!
- All right, nice one, dude!
Oh, yeah, here, here, try some!
Go ahead, dude, pig out.
This is music.
Mu-sic.
It's almost as important as food.
Ooh, bad tune, dude.
Don't ever listen to that kinda music.
Rots your brain.
Now, this is my band.
I wrote this song.
Bitchin', huh?
Ha-ha!
All right, dude, metal!
Okay, I'm OD.
O-D.
D-O.
O-D.
OD, man.
All right, man, this is incredible.
Lemme try.
Hi, monster.
I'm Suzy.
Su-zy.
Suzy.
Wow, he's cute.
I don't believe this.
Move over, it's my turn.
Okay, monster-
- Sherman.
I'm Sherman.
Sherman.
Say it.
Sherman.
- Sher, Sher, Sher, Sher--
- Yeah, Sherman.
Sherman!
This is TV.
T-V.
Next to food and music, this is mankind's greatest invention.
Watch.
I had a date the other night.
Poor fella.
I turned all the lights off and I whispered to him,
"Whatever you do, honey, don't look at me.
One glance and you're hard as a rock."
Needless to say, the poor guy peeked.
Now you see why I have this thing for phone freaks.
Hey, guys, come here a minute.
Be right back, okay monster?
What are we going to do with him?
We're gonna make a million bucks.
- Huh?
- Huh?
Don'tcha see, this is like, amazing.
I mean, a monster from outer space, like-- it's like we own him!
Oh, yeah, rude!
I mean, that guy probably doesn't even know what money is.
Hey, wait a minute, bozo.
Who said anything about you?
I'm the one who saw him first.
Grampa and me discovered him.
He came through our TV.
He's our property.
Hey, spud, I'm the one who communicated with him first.
He takes orders from me, so, watch it, dude.
Come on you guys.
Don't be so selfish.
Why can't he belong to all of us?
Yeah, come on, dude.
This is like... a miracle or something.
There'll be plenty of dough for all of us.
What about Mom and Dad?
Shouldn't we tell them?
Forget Mom and Dad, we don't have to share anything with them!
They wouldn't believe us anyway.
So, like, partners, okay?
Partners-- okay, Sherm?
I guess so.
Oh, cool, cool, you guys are really cool, man.
So... first thing...
I think... we have to get him on TV.
Well, it's time for Medusa's beauty sleep now, kiddies.
So, 'til next week,
Medusa hopes you have some real... wet... nightmares.
I know.
Medusa, maybe she'll help us.
Yeah, dude, she understands monsters.
Let's call her.
But no more partners, okay?
Here, let me do the talking.
No, I've already called her once tonight.
She knows me.
You told her about the monster?
Yeah, but she didn't believe me either.
- TV.
- Whoa!
Whatsa matter, dude?
TV.
Whoa, I hope this guy's house trained.
Uh, for Chrissake, will somebody get me outta this thing?
Oh, Medusa, you were wonderful tonight.
You were absolutely brilliant.
Come on, come on, come on!
Hey, Al, uh, give me brew and, uh, give me a smoke.
Okay, I'll be right back.
All right, thanks, pal.
Show's over, sucker.
Hello, Medusa, this is Sherman again, remember me?
Sherman?
The schizo.
Well, you know that monster I told you about?
He's really here.
We're teaching him to talk, me and my sister.
And me, man, OD Riley!
Well, listen, Sherman,
I've had a long night.
So, uh, call me next week, huh, we'll chat it up.
- But wait!
- Let me!
Medusa?
Oh, who's this, your split personality?
This is Suzy Putterman, Sherman's sister.
Business manager for the monster from outer space.
So, tell me, Suzy, is your whole family a little cuckoo?
Please, Medusa, this is serious!
He's a real live monster!
We wanna know how to get him on TV.
Listen, kid, you want a guest spot, talk to the Letterman people.
Medusa's strictly solo.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta hit some parties.
Please, Medusa!
I'm sure if you saw him, you'd be interested.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, and we're having sort of a... party for him here, right now.
A real fun party.
Party, huh?
You could just come and take a look.
No obligation.
He's gonna be a big sensation.
He talks and everything.
If you don't help us, someone will.
Oh, yeah?
We're on Putterman Lane off Lonesome Canyon, at the end of the road.
Well, like I said, kid, I got some other parties to hit.
So, uh, don't count on me anytime soon.
Uh, bye, now.
- She coming?
- Who knows?
- She had a crummy attitude.
- Hmm.
TV, TV.
That's okay, guy, there's always somethin' else on.
That's what's so cool about TV.
TV!
Hey, hold your horses, turkey.
What are you doing?
Hey, man, nothing.
This guy just doesn't dig commercials.
Be careful, you guys.
He wants music.
Shh, come on now, be quiet, okay?
Yeah, dude, don't be so impatient, butt-hole.
What's your name?
What planet are you from?
He doesn't know what you're talking about.
He's just a monster.
I'll get it.
It's her already?
No way!
Hey, hey don't let any strangers in.
I have a warrant here for the arrest of Sherman Putterman.
Huh?
Hi, guy.
Hi, monster.
Hi, monster.
Hey, it's that same dude again.
...too late.
It's appetite is uncontrollable.
The slightest excitement can trigger a monstrous eating binge.
I bet you anything he's talking about the monster.
I am your friend, Pluthar.
Hey, hey, cool it!
We're, uh, having a little, uh, party.
Hey, hey!
Hey, I said shut up, butt-hole!
- Oh, my God!
- All right, get back, lady!
- Oh!
- Sis, sis!
- Oh!
- Sis, run quick!
Freeze, son, you're under arrest.
Hey, hey!
Hey, you kids, come back here!
You come outta there or I'm gonna come in after you.
Damn you, kids, you--
What happened?
Saw that space guy on TV.
Went crazy!
Where's OD?
It ate him.
Oh, my God!
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna blow his butt to kingdom come.
Huh?
First, secure the perimeter.
Sherman?
I'm calling the cops.
Second, break out the fire power.
Doo-doo, they cut off our phone!
Sherman, have you been making prank calls again?
Here, best chance to stop him is a brain shot.
What are you talking about?
We don't even know where his brain is!
This is so stupid, Sherman.
This is like, totally disgusting!
Let's split, we can use that cop's radio.
No, gotta evacuate Mom and Dad first.
Wow, these grenades are pretty neat.
Maybe I killed it already.
Didn't sound too dead when it ate that cop.
Yeah, well, maybe I wounded it.
OD!
Oh!
Gross!
Sis, get back!
Oh!
Mom?
Dad?
You guys in here?
Mommy?
Are you okay?
It ate them!
Sherman, let's get out of here!
Perfect setup for a surprise attack.
Attack?
I'm so sure!
The hand grenade didn't even phase him!
I've got an idea.
Huh?
Cover me.
Be careful!
Hi, monster.
It's me,
Sherman.
Boy--
Attack!
Attack!
Sis, the remote on the wall-- throw it in the water!
Now, throw it!
Throw it!
Let's get outta here, Sherman!
Sis, stop!
Earth children, please, I mean you no harm.
I am Pluthar, here to save you.
Hey, it's the space guy from TV.
Whatta you want from us?
Please, Earthling, there is little time.
I've come to exterminate the hungry beast.
Like, what is going on around here?
What is the hungry beast?
On my planet, the hungry beast is a house pet, similar to your earthly dogs and cats.
But they are highly unstable, prone to mutate wildly and eat everything in sight.
When mutation occurs, they must be exterminated at once.
You mean, like... he was somebody's pet?
Oh, yes.
They're very lovable before they mutate.
Okay, but like, how did it get here?
In our house?
In the extermination process, they are converted to pure energy, beamed to the farthest reaches of the universe.
It's really a very safe form of waste disposal.
Yeah, but like, what did it do with Mommy and Daddy?
- And OD and Gramps?
- And the TV guy?
The beast has ingested Earthlings?
Oh, dear, heavens,
I'll lose my position for this.
Who cares about your stupid position, what about them?
Well... we do have a process.
If I can take the beast back alive, which isn't likely, the victim's genes could be extracted from the hungry beast's tissue and grown in special serum cultures.
You mean, like, clones?
Clones of Mommy and Daddy?
No, no, they'd be the real Mommy and Daddy.
Of course, they'd have to live in special aquariums.
Come on, come on, come on, chee!
Right, neighbors already calling' the cops.
Oh, now this looks like a happening party.
Yeah.
Messy crowd.
What?
Please, children, lay down your weapons and take me to the beast.
Very well, let's go.
Son of a bitch!
Medusa!
Not so fast, asshole!
Yah!
Ugly bastard!
Uh.
I'm... losing... pressure!
Ooh!
Oh, my God!
Right in the nick of time, huh?
You killed him!
Spaceman, spaceman, please don't die!
Hey, what's with you guys?
I just saved your ass!
How 'bout a little gratitude?
You killed him!
You killed him, you stupid bitch!
It was our only hope!
Huh?
Hey, what are you guys, nuts?
Hey, I'm history, man, I'm outta here.
Shoot him, Sherman, shoot him!
Shoot him, Sherman, shoot him!
Come on, kid, blast him!
I can't, it won't work!
Shoot that gun!
That's it, I'm outta here!
The studio, Al, and make it snappy!
Come on, come on, come on!
Judge Villaneuva's got the warrants.
Costa and Edwards will pick up Albierro, and we'll bag Hackman.
- Nobody knows where Barkley is.
- Well, let's not let Hackman get itchy feet.
I'll pick you up at 5:30, and we'll take this turkey while he's still in bed.
Hey, Sonny.
Yeah?
- The good guys won for once.
- [Chuckles] Yeah, for once.
[Chuckling]
Ah!
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!
Yeah!
That's my sweetheart!
[Muttering]
Were you a good girl?
Yeah.
I know you're a good girl.
[Imitating Helicopter]
Oh!
Look at all these toys.
Somebody gonna pick up all these toys in the living room?
Yes, Daddy.
Somebody will.
I know that somebody will.
- Dinner's almost ready.
- Terrific.
Let's go wash up, huh?
Once more.
Draw!
[Imitates TVTurning Off]
It's a strong case.
Good forensics and three witnesses who can put them in the area.
They real bad guys, Daddy?
Oh!
Real bad guys.
We still gonna be able to have dinner with Sonny and Caroline tomorrow?
No problem.
We'll be finished with the paperwork by 5:00.
Sonny told me they've already got a sitter.
[Doorbell Rings]
You expecting someone?
[Woman Screams]
[Man On TV] Jane, in virtually every opinion poll taken in the state of Florida over the last five years, the citizens have overwhelmingly supported the death penalty.
Now, I believe that the penalty of death is a significant deterrent to premeditated murder.
Donna, would you like some orange juice, honey?
Yes, please.
And as this state's attorney general, I will do everything in my power... to see that penalty enforced whenever and wherever it is warranted.
Oh, yes.
[Woman] Candidates, any comments?
Hell, that isn't enough.
You want real deterrent value, you get public executions broadcast live so's all the criminal scum can watch.
- Are these guys serious?
- Of course they're serious.
They're tryin' to get elected.
[Woman] Mr. Clayborn, your thoughts?
It's one thing to go down to the courthouse in Tombstone and watch a public hanging as a matter of personal choice.
But to broadcast the death of a human being into every home in this state... where small children might be watching is an obscenity.
Thank you, gentlemen.
We now go to Raiford Prison... and to the cell of convicted murderer Frank Hackman, who is scheduled to be executed this Friday.
Do we have to watch any more of this?
Wait a minute.
- Hold it.
- [Woman] Good morning, Mr. Hackman.
Good morning, Jane.
You've heard our panel.
Care to share your thoughts?
Even though Mr. Waldman and Mr. Davis... were part of the system that put me here, I agree with them.
[Woman] Do you mean to say that you'd be willing to have your own execution telecast?
Death is God's will, and only God's will.
Even though I didn't commit the crime I've been convicted of, I want my death to count for something.
Broadcasting my execution might help people to see... that any killing, even in the name of justice, is wrong.
Oh, man!
What's wrong?
Nothin' that 20,000 volts wouldn't cure.
Come on.
Let's get outta here.
You're not gonna eat your breakfast?
You should have seen him, Rico.
He was lyin' through his teeth and hiding' behind the cross.
Hey, hey, amigo.
Be cool.
It's not our problem.
It is now.
A Father LaFrano called from Saint Ives church.
He's got some new information on the Hackman case.
He wants to talk to you.
What's to talk about?
Hackman committed murder, and he's gonna fry.
Talk to him.
A parishioner has confessed to being in Daytona with Frank Hackman the night the detective was murdered.
I'm afraid an innocent man may be executed on Friday.
That's it?
Well, by all means, let's run right over to the parole board.
What do ya say, huh?
- Can you identify the parishioner?
- I cannot violate the sanctity of the confessional.
He has released me to say only that much.
So why is this guy comin' forward now?
He's very sick, possibly dying.
He read about Hackman's date coming up, and he decided his conscience would not allow him to go on.
- Marty.
- Excuse me.
The good father here is being played.
Frank Hackman blew away my partner in front ofhis wife and kids, and he deserves to get whatever's comin' to him.
Tell me somethin'.
Why doesn't this guy come to the police?
He's afraid his family will be in danger if he's identified.
[Chuckling]
I should have guessed.
Sure.
Good day, Father.
Thank you, Father.
I apologize if I caused any stress, but my parishioner insisted that I speak directly to Detective Crockett.
May I ask why?
He put Hackman on death row.
[Crockett] Security armored car job back in '79.
[Tubbs] So how much was uncovered?
Not a dime.
Very fast, very clean.
Old-school pros.
How'd you get Hackman?
Me and another cop named Frankel.
We were workin' him.
Frankel went under as a fence.
Had a deal with Hackman for the whole job...
until his cover was blown.
Hackman blew him away with a 12-gauge in front of his kids.
[Mutters] Tight case?
We were lucky to get a conviction.
Had a mountain of circumstantial to tie Hackman to it.
So you think he's guilty?
You bet.
[Man] Paid for by the committee to elect Thomas Waldman— [Man #2] That looked just super.
Now, we need at least 20 gross rating points with the 30's over the next two weeks.
I want you to mix in the 10's with the Sunday-Monday rotation of the final week, okay?
Mr. Waldman?
Yeah?
- A couple of detectives to see you.
- Here I come.
Sonny Crockett.
Good mornin', Tom.
This is my partner, Ricardo Tubbs.
Hello.
Ricardo.
Come on, guys.
Uh, to what do I owe this pleasure?
Well, our soon to be late friend, Frank Hackman.
Oh.
Thanks.
Yeah.
He's become quite a hot topic these days.
Uh, no pun.
[Chuckling]
Yeah, well, we got a hot tip this morning that, uh, our friend is innocent.
Come on, Sonny.
If we had a dime for every last-minute fabrication—
I know, I know, I know, I know.
Well, our lieutenant seems to think there's something to this one.
Hackman is a maggot.
He's been one step ahead of the chair his entire life.
Look, I'm not gonna defend this guy.
That's not the issue here.
He was convicted for a specific murder.
And he's guilty.
We had enough evidence to bury that guy alive.
- All of it was circumstantial.
- Circumstantial?
We had shoe prints outside the apartment, fiber matches, a box of those double-aught Magnums in his car—
Tom.
Clothes to match a neighbor's description.
And need I remind you that his pal, Albierro, testified as to Hackman's intent?
Look, I was the cop that arrested him.
But it was four hours later and more than three blocks away.
[Sighing]
Look, this thing was dumped on me.
But I gotta do it right.
Are you telling me that I have to convince you that Hackman deserves to die?
I'm just trying to maintain some objectivity here and do the right thing.
I would think that you would wanna do the same.
[Sighs] Well, if you're here for my blessing, you're not gonna get it.
My platform is pro-capital punishment.
The last thing in the world I need is an overturn on the biggest conviction of my career.
That's a hell of an attitude you've got there, counselor.
I prefer to think of it as a belief in the system, Detective.
[Crockett] So, our old buddy Mr. Waldman isn't going to be any help at all.
As a matter of fact, the subject wasn't even open for discussion.
Guy doesn't want to confuse his constituency.
Is there anything more out of the priest?
No.
We'll set up concentrated surveillance around the church, photo-fax anyone entering or leaving to Washington.
We need to find any connection we can to Hackman or his crew.
Uh, excuse me, but, uh, isn't this guy gonna be a little crispy day after tomorrow?
- 9:00 a.m.
- That doesn't give us a lot of time.
Is this guy a regular parishioner?
Let's hope so.
Okay.
That's all.
Thanks, Switey.
Crockett.
Yes, sir?
You've gotta be kiddin' me.
What the hell does he want?
We got nothin' to say to each other.
See him.
Marty— He may have a lead on the tip.

[Ends]
Good to see ya.
Save it, Frank.
There's no need for hard feelings, Crockett.
I've made my peace.
I know why I'm here.
Why'd you ask me to come here?
A man's right to face his accusers.
Not many people have the luxury of knowing the exact hour of their death.
I'm losing interest.
You didn't put me here.
I want you to know that.
There'll come a time... when you'll ask for forgiveness, to make your peace with God, and I want you to remember that I don't hold you accountable.
Now, that's dang nice of you, Frank.
I'll keep that in mind.
I didn't kill Frankel.
I did kill other people you don't know about.
And the way I figure it, that's what I'm dyin'for.
So I'm totally prepared, and I've accepted my death as just.
I'm telling you this so, now or later, you ought not to feel any guilt.
That's kind of ironic, don't you think?
I go out for one I didn't do?
Still say you were in Daytona?
It doesn't matter.
None of it does.
[Knocks]
When your days get down to single digits, your mind gets amazingly clear.
You begin to understand the balance.
I'm goin' to a better place, Sonny.
Thanks for comin'up.

Car's registered to Pepe Ferrar.
No criminal record, no wants, no warrants.
[Shutter Clicks]
[Shutter Clicks]
Another batch comin' in, Stan.
There was no sheets on the last two.
[Switek] Okay.
Barretto, Alejandro.
He's got three warrants.
Arrest record:
A D.U.I. In '84, driver's license suspended in '85.
Nada.
Next:
Kirkl, David Michael.
[Muttering] Arrest record: 1982 income tax evasion.
He was indicted.
No wants, no warrants.
We're 0 for 2.
Here's one.
Albierro, Gus.
Here's our confessor.
Why, he's got a sheet as long as my arm.
Gus Albierro, age 57.
Divorced from Felicia Diaz in '78.
Remarried.
Two children.
Owns and operates an auto repair shop in North Miami.
F.B.I. Links Albierro to as many as 14 possible jobs with Hackman.
We got armed robbery, extortion, laundering, trafficking, assault and battery, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.
A lot of arrests, few convictions.
His guise reads like a Chicago businessman.
Twenty-year career, then moved to Miami for retirement.
Yeah, the American dream.
That's history.
I walked away from that part of my life.
I haven't talked to Hackman in years.
It must be kinda tough, seein' him on the news every night.
You get my age, you know a lot of people who die.
How about the ones that get framed, Gus?
Did Hackman kill Frankel, Gus?
What makes you think he didn't?
I have no reason to think that.
You testified that he did the murder.
I testified to his intent.
Wait a minute, Gus.
You were the nail in the coffin.
We didn't have enough evidence to send him up without your testimony.
You know that.
Yeah.
You got somethin' on your chest, Gus?
The man's about to watch his last sunset, Gus.
Did he kill him?
He was with me in Daytona.
You perjured yourself?
[Tubbs] Why?
He was makin' it with my wife.
I wanted to kill him myself.
So who really killed Frankel?
I got a new wife, family.
I'd be dead in a couple of hours if I told you that.
[Tubbs] Why the change ofheart, Gus?
I got two months to go.
Pancreatic cancer.
I kinda know what it's like from where Hackman sits.
[Waldman] I don't care if Albierro is ready to recant.
That's not enough.
Not even for a sway of momentum, let alone a reopen of the case.
How about a stay, at least until we untangle this thing?
At this stage, only the governor can grant stays or pardons.
And that's not gonna happen just because some thug comes up with an 11 th-hour alibi.
The man has cancer.
He wants to right himself before he dies.
He's willing to testify.
Well, you'd probably do the same thing for one of your buddies goin' to the chair, right?
Listen, pal.
I'm not sittin' on this.
What's it gonna take to reopen?
- It's not gonna happen.
- What's it gonna take?
- Two corroborating witnesses.
- You got it.
Guys, you pry this thing open, we're not gonna have enough weight to reconvict, and that maggot's gonna walk.
And that'll be on your heads.
Well, then, you got nothin' to worry about, do ya?
[Crockett] I'll tell you what it is, Gus.
We need someone else to back up your story.
Somebody that was with you in Daytona.
Okay, sport.
Time to help your mom.
Honey!
Come on.
Get your brother.
[Spanish]
Come on.
[Spanish]
It's dangerous dragging' people out of the past.
Nobody wants to remember.
You said you wanted to save Hackman.
I do.
But I got a family.
If my name is in front of all that ghost hunting—
We'll do it quietly.
As far as the press is concerned, we dug it up and forced you to testify.
But we gotta move.
Hackman's scheduled to die in less than 48 hours.
Tommy Barkley.
He was with Hackman and me.
Why didn't he testify then?
He didn't show up for the trial.
Disappeared.
I haven't heard a thing since '80.
Dead end.
Barkley was killed in a prison riot three years ago in Pensacola.
Damn!
Albierro didn't mention this?
Said he hadn't heard from Barkley in six years.
Well, that's it.
We got nothin'.
There's got to be somebody else.
Albierro was very specific.
He said there was just the three of them.
They're gonna kill somebody that I sent up... for something I'm not sure he's done.
It's your past, and you refuse to let it die!
I haven't heard from her in years.
Oh, yeah?
Then why is she sending you this picture?
I have no idea.
Well, you promised.
You swore when we got married you would be out.
No more contact!
Carmen, please believe me.
I'll always take care of you and the children.
You're all I care about.
That's not good enough.
Not this time.
Please, Carmen— No, Gus.
I'm going to my mother's.
And I'm taking the children.
Okay.
And I want a decision by tomorrow.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.

[Man Singing Slow Rock]

[Continues]
[Silenced Gunshots]

[Ends]
[Man] All right!
Wait!
Hold it!
You're the guys from Vice, right?
Yeah.
Hey, you guys eat yet?
No.
Good.
I'd hate to have you lose your breakfast.
Albierro?
Come on.
The rest of him is inside.
Three shots to the forehead.
Now, the slug lines suggest Albierro was on his knees.
Now, whatever he was thinking about is now splattered against the back wall.
Any eyewitnesses?
Nah.
Reads like a contract job.
Did you interview the block?
That's already been done.
The store owner next door said Albierro and his wife... had a real roof raiser last night about closing time.
She stormed over to Mom's just before the hit.
We confirmed the alibi.
Anything else of interest?
Not much.
Usual business records.
Excuse me.
A lot of past-due bills.
That's interesting.
You recognize her?
No.
The wife's inside.
She might have an idea.
[Door Opens] [Crockett] Excuse me.
Mrs. Albierro, could we speak to you a minute?
Yes.
His ex-wife.
[Spanish]
She was a bad person, dragging him down in her filth.
Gus had left all that behind him, but she wouldn't let go.
Albierro was gonna see her?
Not and stay with me.
We had a good life going here.
A real good life.
I didn't want it ruined.
But I guess it's too late now.
Look, I don't know who killed Gus.
I just want to be with my children.
Lab can't find any third-party prints.
Ballistics confirms three .380-caliber slugs, point-blank.
9.9 on the lethal scale, low sixes on neatness.
Whoever whacked Frankel must've got wind of Albierro's recant.
Somebody really wants to see Hackman smoke.
Albierro's statement will stand as a deposition, but we still need corroboration.
Well, you got less than 20 hours.
How about the postcard?
Felicia, Albierro's first old lady.
They broke up after she got horizontal with Hackman.
- Any return address?
- Postmark Stuart, F-L-A.
Stuart?
That's my old stompin'grounds.
Trained up there with the local P.D. Until I got transferred here to the big leagues.
You know of any good seafood joints down there?
Venus Clam Trap, uh, rolling roach coach out by the stadium.
Stop by Waldman's.
See if we can buy some more time.
Tom, we need a stay.
You got someone to corroborate Albierro's story?
Albierro was hit last night.
Someone didn't want him to talk.
You happen to know who that someone is?
'Cause if you don't, I got absolutely nothing to go on.
Come on, Waldman.
Somebody is throwin' roadblocks in our way.
We need a little more time.
We're very close to provin' Hackman's innocence.
Close?
You're not even in the parking lot.
You've got a guy who cooks up a very interesting confession, you've got no physical evidence and no one to back him up.
So Albierro gets hit.
Miami is the murder capital of the world.
One more reason for the death penalty as a deterrent.
Come on!
Would you spare me the campaign rhetoric?
You wanna turtle this issue until after the election.
And what do you want?
Let loose a cold-blooded killer?
That guy is wrong.
Everybody knows that.
The system worked.
Why can't you just let it go?
Because I'm the cop that put him there.
And I'm the lawyer.
My conscience is clear.
No, no.
You're a politician.
A conscience is optional.
Man, that guy reeks of 30-weight.
I think we're chasin' our tails, man.
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.
Somethin' isn't right, man.
It was a hell of a lot easier the first time.
You've gone the distance, partner.
That's all anyone can ask.
[Man On P.A.] Panthers, first down and 10 on their own 24-yard line.
Hand off to Wiggins.
[Continues, Indistinct] [Crowd Cheering] ... Roger Armstrong at the 27-yard line.
Second down, seventh, Memphis.
What do you say we wait till she closes up?
Game'll be over soon.
Incomplete pass.
Catch by Mitchell.
I don't like the looks of that car.
Neither do I. Make the call.
Get me MacGruder.
Looks like our lady.
[Siren Wailing]
[Vehicles Approaching, Sirens Wailing]
- Freeze!
F.B.I.!
- Take it easy.
We're cops.
- Up against the car.
- Where the hell did the suits come from?
Keep your hands on the car now!
I.D.'s in the left pocket.
Now that we've lost the element of surprise, what do you wanna do, partner?
Think I'd like to have a little chat with one Thomas Barkley.
Looks pretty healthy for a corpse.
[Engine Starts]
[Whispers] They are cops.
Surprise, surprise.
[Vehicle Departs]
The guy caps a 20-year career of major-league theft... by supposedly blocking' bullets in a prison riot, only to turn up three years later frying clams out in Stuart.
Barkley's on the Witness Protection Program.
What?
[Scoffs]
The prison death was fictionalized?
F.B.I.'s most prized canary.
Helped bring down entire networks, fences, money launderers.
Well, that's fine.
But that doesn't explain why he's lettin' his buddy go to the chair.
Well, maybe Hackman figured into the feds' plan.
Doesn't follow.
Barkley's got enough names and dates not to feed 'em Hackman.
We have 14 hours to find out.
- Can you pull enough strings to get us Barkley's address?
- Yes.
?
[Man Singing]
Ready for your supper?
Anything I can do for you?
No.
Thanks, eh?
Wilson.
I want you to have this.
I can't.
Please.
You made a difference here.
I got nobody else.
Take it.
Frank, really, I appreciate it, but I can't.
I'll lose my job.
?
[Continues]
I thought we were just gonna talk to this guy.
I'm willin' to talk.
Sonny—
This guy knows the truth, Rico.
He's gonna tell me.
?
[Fades]
[Hammer Cocks]
It's rude to drop in unannounced.
[Hammer Cocks] This is our invitation.
Should have R.S. V.P. 'd.
The way I figured it, anything goes wrong,
Felicia's the only one walking out of this party.
- Who are they?
- Cops or amateurs.
No self-respecting thief would be this stupid.
Let me see some I.D.
Vice.
Miami.
Well, gentlemen, let's skip the lesson in manners... and move right on to a short course in blanket immunity.
It's a top-dollar blanket.
Total immunity.
The law can't touch Thomas Barkley.
Hackman's the one on the hot seat.
Albierro told us he's innocent.
Albierro's an old fool.
From what I hear, sweetheart, you're the one who's been foolin' around.
Could, um, you and I take a little walk?
Anything I can do for you?
How about a power failure?
[Laughing]
Forget it.
Hey, I'm just a pre-Miranda kind of guy.
Back then there was a definite possibility that cops could get a guy to talk.
Not now.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
We're all a bunch of pussycats now.
[Groans]
So I'm not gonna waste any more of the short time that Hackman has left—
[Groaning]
By violating your civil rights.
I'm gonna make it real simple, pal.
You're gonna tell me the truth, or I'm gonna make one phone call to Chicago.
Then in four hours, a plane's gonna land in Miami,
and then in six hours, you'll be dead.
[Gasps]
What do you wanna know?
That's better.
Who killed Frankel?
A button man from Buffalo.
De Santis.
Everybody knew that Frankel was a cop.
A lot of people wanted him hit.
Now, Hackman was with you in Daytona?
Yeah.
Me and Albierro.
Why didn't you show up for the trial?
Felicia.
Nobody's that good, pal.
She is.
[No Audible Dialogue]
Miami Vice.
Take it through channels, Crockett.
[Chattering]
Governor, Miami Vice.
We have depositions that will exonerate Frank Hackman.
Governor, if I could recommend that this be handled through the appropriate channels.
Tom, this man has a little over an hour left.
Let's not worry about procedure.
Get me a phone.
Yo.
Sonny, come to see the crumbling dream?
Check it out.
" Waldman down 10 points in polls after Hackman pardon. "
Made the front page.
- I came by to say I'm sorry about the way it worked out.
- Oh, that's big of you.
I'm not gonna apologize for doin' my job, Tom, or for doin' what I thought was right.
You think I care about your motivation?
You cut the legs out of my career, man.
Since when is that more important than a man's life?
Hackman is a slug.
The world would be that much lighter without him.
That's not a call you get to make, Tom.
You must feel good.
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
You know, Rico, in 12 years, this is the first time I ever got anyone out of the slam.
Let's not make it a habit.
[Laughing]
It sure as hell feels different playing' both sides of the field.
Well, we just catch 'em.
We don't cook 'em.
That's Waldman's job.
Hackman.
[Door Buzzing]
Didn't expect to see you here.
Thanks, Crockett.
- Just doin' my job.
- Like I knew you would.
[Car Horn Honking]
Gus was dyin'.
He wanted his family to be cared for.
I bought his confession.
You killed Frankel.
[Chuckling] Yeah.
I won't be needin' this anymore.
Maybe you can use it.
?
[Man Singing]
?
[Continues]
The match is about to start.
Get into positions.
The last time you guys started fighting, and ended up in the police-station.
Get away... don't come near me!
No sporting spirit whatsoever.
I'll send you off the field.
Especially you.
I'll keep my eyes on you!
Boney M, we asked you to be referee.
Stop grumbling or we'll get rid of you.
Don't come near me!
Any bets?
Sure!
Remember, the money goes to the winning team.
Great!
Football is constructive gambling.
Right!
- Don't break the rules.
- O. K!
Ready!
The Duckies team to kill off!
Hey crazy!
Here's something for you!
What are you doing here?
Get over there!
How do you like this?
The whistle!
Why the whistle?
I didn't blow!
Who did?
Nobody did.
Start playing!
Watch this!
Ready to kick off!
Watch both sides!
Pull his pants off!
Don't let him pass.
- Knock him down!
- O.K.!
Blow the whistle!
The referee didn't blow!
Then who did?
What is it?
What happened?
1 to 1!
Great, 1 to 1!
Ready!
Get back!
Get over there!
Watch him!
Up here, up there.
Don't let him kick!
Don't shoot at me!
Don't pull my pants, it's not here.
Don't block me.
Move over!
I can't see with you in front!
Shot!
Why didn't you get it?
It's not my fault.
You were blocking me.
Who did!
Go get the ball!
Why did you hit me?
Your call!
Guess someone wants tips for the horse race.
I'm in the police-station.
Is the boss back yet?
He's not back yet!
I can't get back in time.
Can you drive the car out?
I'm not licensed.
Stop...!
Don't go!
Don't be late or we'll be fired.
I've got your loaf of a car here.
- I'll take a cab back!
- O.K.!
- Let me drive!
- Go ahead!
- You broke the lights!
- Really?
You've scratched that car!
Let me stop the car first!
Let me push!
How come you're in reverse?
Your want to fool around.
Stop looking.
Turn the wheel and get out.
Am I driving now?
Get off and get the car back!
Damn.
This is trouble!
Push it over there!
My car!
What to do?
You tell me!
Bye-bye!
You look awful boss!
All my fault.
I got you into trouble!
No problem!
Go get a driver's license!
You two dare come and see me.
You ruined the customer's car.
You guys must leave!
Why?
Let's go!
I'll get you!
I'll break your legs.
Ridiculous!
Our salary all gone!
I owe 2 months' rent.
Where can I go?
You can join us!
Don't you live with your girlfriend.
She'd...
I'll talk to her!
What's this?
Is it a compliment?
We're broke.
You'll have to pay us.
You'd do this kind of business too.
Let's go!
Over there!
Why ring the bell when you have keys?
You don't understand!
She always walks around nude.
Don't tempt me.
Where's the toilet?
Over there.
Help yourself!
Sure!
Don't expect you to help me!
What is it?
Don't stop me.
Where do you think this is.
Always bringing people to stay.
I'm leaving!
This is expensive.
I can't replace it.
Don't go!
I will shout now.
I can't stand your girlfriend.
I'll go!
Don't, we love putting on an act.
We always do that.
Pretend she doesn't exist.
I'll finish the act with her.
This is awful for my kidney.
I bought these.
Now you can have them.
You're giving up a lot.
Stop it.
Let go!
He's gone!
Hing...!
How could you.
He has a complex!
You hurt his pride.
Now he's gone.
You should be happy!
Hey, Sunny!
The door's broken!
Sunny, open up!
You still here?
You've got to push hard.
- Are you alright?
- What alright?
That's good!
Why don't you two get married!
I can't bear to watch!
- Don't go!
- Let go!
- Don't go!
- Let go...
Look at this.
What a mess!
Move over!
She's crying her heart out!
If she cries then all is well.
Help clean up!
You're off early.
Your boss fix you up again!
I got fried!
That's bad!
Give me the stuff.
What?
Another act for your mom.
What to do?
It's only temporary!
- Goose!
- Goose!
- This is a pump!
- Pump!
How are you?
Let's start now.
Let's do it.
1234, 2234 3234, 4234
1234, 2234
2234, 3234
Up, down...
Up, down...
Stop pumping!
My glasses.
My goose.
My goldfish!
Take the goose out!
You're off early!
Early?
This isn't early!
Is my watch broken?
It's only 2:30 p.m.
Maybe my boss's watch is!
Excuse me!
Don't follow me!
Just follow the TV.
I'll be back in a minute.
Next, do what I'm doing.
Lie down!
How come you're so early today?
I got a promotion!
So I can leave whenever I like.
Another promotion?
Of course.
You just got one last week.
Seems a bit incredible.
I used to be on the 2nd floor.
Now.
I'm Assistant Manager, I'm on the 12th floor, it's quite a walk if the lift breaks down.
I thought they pulled this building down.
The office is too small.
We're building a bigger one.
My company is really good to me.
What's the use.
You don't get paid much.
I'm nagging you again.
You don't save up.
You don't bring any money home.
If not for my cooking classes, we'd be in trouble.
I don't know how you'll get a wife.
You're just like your dad.
Always grinning!
Let's celebrate tonight.
We'll have a goose!
Those outside?
Yes!
Maria...!
Open up!
- What is it?
- Coming...!
- Eva fainted!
- Fainted?
Oh my God!
She was doing the TV exercises-back bends.
Back bends?
You're late.
Hurry!
Why are you all dressed up?
You're just here to be practiced on.
Don't say anything.
The coach told me.
He's in a hurry to go racing.
Fall after 10 minutes.
What do you mean "Fall"?
Pretend to be knocked down.
It's not your first time!
I got a sandbag for you.
Very lasting.
He's a Thai farmer.
Strong legs.
Coach!
At your service!
You didn't get me.
But I could feel the force.
Try my legs!
Didn't you say he's very lasting?
He is.
But you're much better than him.
Yeah, your legs are so powerful!
Keep it up, another 3 minutes to go.
I know!
In positions!
Here we go...!
Are you ready?
Let's start then!
Go!
This is a good punch!
I'll show you something!
You're supposed to be hit only.
What is this.
He's punching back.
It's more exciting!
Exciting!
Oh no, he's gone!
Shit...!
Stop giggling.
Get off!
Boss...!
How are you boss?
I didn't ask you to be Rocky.
Do I get paid?
Pay!
Don't ever come to me again!
Forget it then!
Here's the drinks machine!
Have you got change?
No.
I wasn't looking for drinks.
I've got some!
I'll treat you.
What will you have?
Whatever you're having!
I'm on a diet!
Then I'll treat you to tea.
O.K. I'll wait for you to get changed!
I'm in love and you're watching.
But there's no defense.
My dear wife!
You're useless!
You don't earn money.
You're even slow with paying.
I don't get a chance to buy more.
It's really unfortunate to marry a rich wife.
- Really?
- Of course!
Miss!
I'd never do that!
Let's go over there!
Let's go...!
What's that guy doing?
You look like a boss.
He must have mistaken you.
I've been fired both times I've met you.
Wonder what will happen next time.
Don't worry.
It won't happen again.
That guy is still following us.
Over here!
Look over here!
Right, this side is better.
What will you do if I kiss you in public?
Did she answer that for me?
I think she wants to, but she doesn't dare.
Do you agree?
Are you trying to test me?
Yes!
Isn't it a little too fast?
Look!
See, I told you.
Girls are very changeable.
I've got to go home!
My dad's waiting.
I'll take you home.
It's O.K. I'll take the bus.
She's taken the bus?
Bye-bye!
Where shall we meet tomorrow?
At the kissing place, bye!
At the kissing place, bye-bye!
Miss, why are you going up and down!
You don't want him to know you're rich?
You don't understand.
Love should be a little mysterious!
You new comers are so slow.
It'll be sunset soon!
Let's move it!
Nearly there...!
What?
Nothing!
Changing!
You two again.
You're here to!
If he's working here, I quit.
Don't be silly.
We'll get him fired.
Right.
Let's go!
This is flour.
You start stirring.
Anything you don't understand.
Ask Uncle Mao.
- Uncle Mao...
- Who's that?
That's Diva Ping.
She sings Cantonese opera at night.
You'll hear lots more.
Get started!
La scala, ma ma mia,
Pronto, bambina muncha.
Sonore rapido a la la luna.
Senor e senorhina, tutte bono.
Mi scusi, agua roma.
Cinqe mille, cinqe cento, allegro.
Look over there...
Please.
You love buckets, do you?
Put the flour in the big one.
It's so big, you'll really enjoy it.
Machismo si si pronto.
What's the matter.
Pouring the whole thing.
You're crazy!
Turn off the fan!
A power cut again.
Hurry!
We can stop!
Why did you turn the power off.
Turn it on.
This is for the fan.
Told you so.
It's so small how can it be the power switch.
What's going on?
None of my business.
Ask him!
What's this?
Supervisor...
You are taking pills!
You'll kill yourself taking so many!
What are they talking about?
She's done it again.
Done what?
She's forgotten to pay the electricity bill.
That's the ninth time already!
Let's get a Mahjong game going!
A power cut, none of our business.
I told you so.
How come the manager still helps her?
He always finds someone else to take the blame.
What?
You three, up here!
I want to know why we're fired.
Because you're hopeless at your job!
Us?
What about her then?
- Let's get this straight.
- None of your business!
- Did you forget to pay the bill?
- Yes.
- So you're hopeless at your job.
- Yes.
- Is he looking for a scapegoat?
- Yes.
- Do you have something going with him?
- Yes!
Are you...?
How dare you carry on like this?
Get the police.
Don't eat it...
Please let me...
The foreman is taking advantage!
Come over here and look!
Are you alright?
I took those pills, what to do?
Call an ambulance.
Pump your stomach out!
What about us?
Take your clothes off!
You didn't even pay the phone bills.
Billie...!
You're trying to set us up.
You won't do it.
What do you want?
I'll prove to you.
I'll prove to you.
I'II...
I won't repeat it.
These pigs were our commune's excess quota.
That's why you've got them so cheaply!
You'll get something for it.
- Who are you looking for?
- The manager!
You can't go in!
- Has he gone to look for the Manager?
- Really?
We'll make a secret deal,
I'll get $500,000.
From the Company funds for you.
Are you the Manager?
Do you know lots of undertable deals go on here?
None of my business.
I'm in white, a good guy.
I don't know him.
Comrade...!
Who are you?
They just started work today!
What do you want?
Do you know there is someone abusing their power?
Really?
How despicable.
Lots of things go on behind your back.
He uses his power to threaten the workers, cover up, and takes advantage of girls.
That's right!
How dare he?
How come I don't know?
Good, here you cousin, you heard it all.
You have to find out who it is.
I'll do that, cousin!
Rest assured.
I trust this cousin completely.
What were you saying just now?
Go on!
They're trespassing on private property.
- Call the police!
- Yes.
You three, come with me!
The Chairman is here!
Cousin, you take charge of them.
I'll go and see the Chairman!
The Chairman!
Should we go and complain?
Take them out!
Hurry, let's go!
Watch it or I'll sue you for racial prejudice.
I'm going to Canada in 2 days time.
You look after this consignment of goods.
I've never been afraid of being fired.
Big deal.
So what if we're fired!
Dad!
Trying to tell on me.
Now you're getting it.
- Supervisor.
- Manager!
Chairman!
The 3 of them!
They're the Chairman's friends.
Long time no see!
Longer yet for you!
I've never met him before!
Don't worry, you'll get unemployment pay.
Is this April Fool's Day?
What April Fool?
We didn't get fired and we got a raise.
Someone's treating!
Are we comrades at arms?
Right here we are!
Wait a minute...
Press the bell first.
That's the rule.
- Where's the toilet?
- Over there!
Is it occupied?
Can't open the door!
This door's funny, gotta push it hard.
Unity is strength. 1,2,3!
Now what?
History repeats itself.
I'm leaving.
Leaving.
You're always saying that!
Don't shout so loud.
If you end up not leaving, what a loss of face.
Damn you, I'll strangle you!
This first time I've seen it!
I'm better.
I've seen it before.
You think this is a charity home!
You stay here.
That should make you happy!
The girl wants to leave.
This is ruining it for them.
Let's go!
Don't!
They love acting.
No fun without an audience.
Really, well they've got quite an audience now.
Always with your friends, never with me.
I never know where you are!
I'm practicing with them!
Then you're in the wrong!
See, they say you're wrong too.
She's crying, crying!
It's O.K. once she starts crying.
Jane...!
You guys are useless!
Go jump in a dry lake!
Over here!
Hurry, I'm starving!
I love Japanese food!
Haven't seen you for a while!
Mr. Our tips is very little.
Thank you. $1,750!
I gotta make a call!
O.K.
Thank god I found you.
It's noisy where you are.
Mahjong?
This is urgent.
Bring me some money.
Johnny!
Can you hear me?
I need money!
Money!
What are you looking at?
I'll give you the money now, you pay for me.
Don't let him know.
How come you look so worried?
Are you feeling alright?
Amy, I'd better tell you the truth.
Go ahead!
The doctor told me just now.
I can't eat fish.
It's an illness called...
Fear of fish!
Fear of fish!
Are you feeling alright?
It's acting up!
I can't breathe!
My father's got the same illness.
- Oh yeah!
- Yes!
There's really such an illness?
He takes soya sauce if it acts up.
You try!
How is it?
Better?
Seems a little better.
That means you've got to take more.
What kind of soya sauce do you uses?
The best Japanese kind.
No wonder.
I can't take Japanese soya sauce.
I'll break out in a rash.
It's itchy!
Don't worry.
We've got local soya sauce too.
How do you feel?
Full!
How come there's always a car following us?
What is it?
Promise me something.
What?
No matter what happens, we're good friends!
Do that somewhere else.
Couldn't you just wait.
- I'm really happy tonight.
- Me too!
Bye-bye.
It's her again.
Bye-bye!
I won't be so mild next time I see you!
Don't waste your time.
No use going after rich girls.
If not, I would have gone after you.
Really?
You'll have to part sooner or later.
Don't you believe in the magic of love?
I'll prove to you!
Where are you going?
Yam!
One each.
Put it back!
How's your stomach?
So clean it shines.
Today we'll show them.
Get them up.
Don't worry.
I'm all set to go.
Don't read so many porno books, it's bad for you!
Are you very healthy?
Master Yam!
You don't have to do it yourself.
Good morning!
One each.
Put it back!
Is this a card?
It's ok...
I've moved you to a special department.
Very cushy.
You'd love it.
This is the pump room.
Just watch the noodles go in the machine.
Master Sunny, Master Hing!
Just keep an eye on the water and electricity gauges.
Master Yam, your job is even better.
Just watch this oil machine, and shake this knob.
Don't press the wrong buttons.
You know this is special treatment.
They've got my job.
What do I do?
You do their jobs!
How can I do 3 men's job?
If you can't, you're fired.
I'll do it...!
Let's get started!
Where are you going?
You help me watch, I'm going to the toilet.
I never see you drinking but you go all the time.
Sir, the factory will lose out a lot if we do this.
Tell them to explain it to the Chairman.
Do you think we'll get into trouble?
Don't worry.
I've got something on my cousin.
What's happening?
A red light?
What does that mean?
That means danger!
I know that.
What danger though?
How should I know?
Let's hide!
Over here, look at this.
How come the noodles are this color?
Looks pretty, not bad!
- All set to go.
- Let's go!
Sir!
Phone call!
I feel wonderful today.
No calls.
He's not taking calls.
What?
Health Inspector coming up?
Sir!
Mr. Manager!
Health Inspector?
Mr. Lai!
Unscheduled inspection?
What's up?
Why do you look so nervous?
No... no, not nervous!
Sir, the noodles...
Noodles.
Noodles.
What noodles?
The color of the noodles are great.
Three color noodles!
You 3 jerks are so happy.
Someone put dye in the oil of your pump room.
A dirty trick on us?
Who is it?
I'll beat him up.
Don't bother.
They're in for it already.
The Health Inspector is here.
He saw the noodles are screamed!
It's still early.
Why not have a cup of tea?
Let me check the line first!
Why not check the warehouse?
We've got some new flour in.
Why not the toilets?
We just cleaned them.
Right, check the toilets.
Do your toilets have new products in too?
Not now, I can't tell later though.
You've got to be sure.
Decide.
What to inspect?
Don't let anyone influence you.
Yes!
What is this?
What are you 3 doing?
Cleaning the machines!
You told us to do so this morning!
Cleaning the machines?
Yes, machine cleaners.
Right, today is cleaning day.
You said you were going to demonstrate to us.
Demonstrate?
What?
You said you'd show us how to clean it!
What?
We show you?
If you don't, we'll wash these soap suds down,
You know what will happen then.
That's how it's done.
I just had my stomach cleaned out and now this.
I can't stand it!
I don't care what you've had cleaned out.
What I do, you do too!
Have some suds.
He usually tricted us like this before.
It's not fun at all if they play dirty, and we don't play back.
That's true!
Sorry!
You scratched my shoes.
Foreman, are you alright?
Keep working!
Boy.
What is wrong with you, Billie.
You're disgusting, mean!
Sir, it's time!
While I'm in Canada for 2 weeks, remember to water the roses.
Don't feed the fish too much.
The flowers and fish are precious to him.
You are too.
The bags are in the car.
You should leave now!
Let's go!
I'll talk to your Uncle.
You can work in his factory.
You've got to learn so that you can help me!
I know, dad!
Bye-bye!
Bon voyage!
What is it?
My mother is ill!
Then go and see her.
This is such a big house, you alone...
Don't worry.
I'll move to a hotel.
You're so good, miss!
Hey!
Hello!
My boss has gone to Canada.
It's empty!
Then I can spend time with you.
No, I've got to go my mother.
Send her my regards!
Don't be like that.
The flowers and fish need care.
Can you do me this favor!
If you let me kiss you!
I've got a train to catch.
Next time!
Didn't get anywhere?
None of your business!
I've got something for you!
Watch it, don't catch cold!
I've got the boss's house keys.
Where did you get it from?
I exchanged it with a videotape.
Videotape?
You can take a girl there!
I haven't got any.
All yours!
My girl's left me.
Let Yam have it!
Yeah, let Yam have it!
Crazy!
Don't say we're not friends.
We got you a car.
Let's go to the house and have fun!
This should be it.
How come we're here?
Exciting!
Just two of us tonight.
It'll be romantic
I'll open the door.
Master, are you home!
Master, are you home!
Welcome home!
How come you're all here.
Is this a trap!
Welcome miss to our Villa.
Welcome!
Over here please!
The owner's photo!
Hide it.
Here they come!
Come in!
- The flowers!
- What?
Very fresh!
Master asked us to cut all flowers in the garden for you.
The whole garden?
You're moved to tears!
Roses really work.
She looks like.
Sit down!
Don't cry...
Roses, roses, I love you!
Master, miss, have some tea!
Sticky rice in Malaysia style...
How many servants do you have?
I don't know.
They come in groups.
I don't know how many!
Not like this.
Like this!
Oh, any way will do!
What are you laughing about?
Crazy Chick and Boney M!
Boney M?
We're serving spare ribs and fish today.
Yes.
That's it.
Get it out.
This one!
Why don't we catch all of them!
These fish!
Very fresh.
We keep them in the back.
What is it?
I think I can't take fish!
Get some soya sauce for you!
Bring some soya sauce.
Bring two!
Tastes funny.
What kind of fish is it?
Japanese Kenno fish!
What's that?
A kind of goldfish.
Master can't take goldfish!
Where's the toilet?
Second on the right!
How do you know?
Looks like her!
Add a little more!
Big trouble!
Let's run!
The girl is the boss's...
Wife!
You all know already?
What is it?
I'm going to tell the truth.
But you must not get angry!
O.K. what is it?
I am your boss's daughter!
What?
Oh, my God.
Let us spend our lives peacefully together, please don't disturb us again!
Come back!
Oh, my god!
Coming.
Who is it?
Who are you looking for?
Excuse me, does Yam live here?
I get it.
Come in!
You're very beautiful!
What's your name?
I'm Amy!
I'm Maria!
Fantastic!
Would you like a Coke?
No thanks!
You two stay up,
I'm going to bed!
Yam, open the door!
You have to face your responsibilities.
Nothing to say.
You just wanted me.
You were trying to cheat me too.
Or else, why did you take me to the villa?
Oh, my god!
Maria!
I've got to feed the fish!
Why are you so nervous?
With all of them watching, of course I'm nervous!
Actually they're in it too.
We should just be happy.
Can't you see that?
Just talk to him!
How can you just leave the mess?
I'll tell them to clean it up tomorrow.
I didn't mean them.
I meant you and me!
It's too much between us already.
If we go on, I'll die!
What do you want?
Yam, come on out!
I won't.
You men never take responsibility.
Now that she's pregnant, what do you do?
Maria, you don't understand!
Just call me mom!
Mom?
Good!
Of course I understand.
I'm very liberal.
I used to be just like you!
And he is just like his dead father, never takes responsibility.
Yam!
Mom, you don't even know what happened.
Stay out of it!
You're telling me to stay out.
Majority rules.
Do you think I should stay in?
Yes!
Let's take a vote!
It's none of my mother's business, leave her out!
None of my business.
Don't talk big now that you're Assistant Manager.
What, you've been made Assistant Manger?
Don't talk about things you don't know about!
What?
Don't talk?
I've raised you all these years and I can't talk.
He told me not to talk!
O.K. I'll keep quiet!
I won't say anything.
He said so!
I'll cry without a noise!
See what you've done.
My mom's gone crazy.
Assistant manager!
So what.
Miss Chairman's daughter.
We're off work now.
We're not in the factory.
This is my home.
Please leave.
Kiss...!
I'm telling you off.
Don't flirt.
I think we must never meet again!
This is such a waste!
We really have to part.
Yes.
Part, Chop Chop.
Good bye!
Cut up.
Over and out.
Like this.
From now on, we go our separate ways.
East and west.
Get it?
Where shall we meet tomorrow?
I'm saying goodbye.
What to do?
Is the girl with you?
You two arrived just in time.
Please take miss Chairman's daughter home.
That's it.
No more!
Told you to come in a taxi!
You could have come in one!
I haven't any money!
I don't believe it.
We've cut off our relationship!
O.K. see you tomorrow!
We'll take her back to the house.
I'm not going there.
I'm staying in a hotel.
Oh my God.
- Mom!
- Mom!
You told me it was a porno tape.
But it's the Silk Road.
Then give it back!
What about me then?
Return the keys to him.
Sorry!
Trying to fool me!
Good morning, see you later!
Oh no, the girl has found her way here.
We've really got to think about this.
I'm lousy at this kind of thing.
That's not very nice of you.
We're in the same boat.
What?
Did you say I am not nice?
It's none of your business.
Why get so nervous?
It's his boat!
Right, and we don't get to sit in it!
Let's go.
Morning...!
- Good morning, Uncle Wu!
- Morning...!
The Chairman's daughter?
Feel good!
Cousin.
What's the matter?
Come and see.
See what?
The boss's daughter is in the factory.
I've just put aside $500,000 for the pigs.
Dangerous.
Don't show her the books!
What does my dad like to do most?
Usually he takes phone calls, looks at the books.
It's tiring to look at the books.
Better to read magazines and look at photos.
Why don't you go and take a look at the factory?
I know who can take me around.
Go to hell!
Stop following me, will you?
I'll accompany you!
I don't need company when I work.
Really?
Go away!
Amy, are you free?
The manager wants to have a few words with you.
I'll look for you later.
Stop following me around?
I'm accompanying you!
I don't need company when I work.
I'll look for you later.
Marry a rich wife, why not!
Can you really do it?
Look good, face of a boss, quite different.
What's this?
Orders from the boss's daughter, it's good for you.
I don't want any, you eat it!
Then we won't stand on ceremony!
Why don't you have some too!
Yam!
Private limousine service.
Please get in!
What is it?
Don't you need a rear license plate?
Does my car have one?
Give me your driver's license.
Driver's license?
Oh no!
Stop!
Got to get a few things clear with you.
What?
Firstly!
You must never order extra food for me.
What else?
When I get off work, don't pick me up in a Rolls Royce.
What else?
When I'm working, don't follow me around.
Get it?
I get it!
If only you weren't...
What if I wasn't?
I quit!
Miss!
Are you blind?
Didn't you see my bike?
Take this car back.
I'm taking the MTR!
I'm warning you now.
You hit my bike.
I haven't given you a ticket yet!
I haven't given you a ticket yet!
I'll sure get fired this time.
We're from the Commercial Crime Section.
Have you seen this person before?
Who is he?
Then you're lucky!
He pretends to be a China trader, and is involved in quite a few fraud cases.
We suspect he's skipped town, maybe gone to Bengali!
We're leaving this photo.
If you see him, contact us.
This is my card!
Were they here to investigate you?
Isn't this Comrade Chu?
What's the matter?
Cousin, what are you doing?
Don't stop me, let me jump!
I've already embezzled so much and now this.
Don't jump, just find a scapegoat!
Find someone, make him the manager, order a lot of stock, have him sign for it.
We'll sell it to get cash.
Then we can repay the money.
What if there is an inventory check?
We'll just blame it on that guy.
Say that he stole it.
We've got to think of something to create, fiction between boss's daughter and the workers, then she won't mess around.
So what is the actual plan?
Dear workers, our Chairman's daughter, is in sympathy with your mechanical daily routine, we have devised a competition in production, we'll increase the speed of the machines, splitting you into the reds, the yellows, the blues,
the group with the highest productivity wins a prize.
Let's see what they're up to now.
Faster machines means more work.
You won't give the extra-wage.
Everybody ready.
Start!
Someone's stuck in the flour!
Shut the mains off in the pump room!
So many switches, which is for the mains?
Let's shut down all, ok.
What is it?
I think he's fainted!
What did you say?
Quit looking, save the guy first.
Are you alright?
Don't move!
Quiet everybody!
We're very sorry about this competition.
Any questions, ask the Chairman's daughter.
See what you've done to the workers?
You'll get compensation.
What do you have to say?
I'm very sorry about this.
I don't know what to do.
Why don't you suggest something.
That's not right, you represent the Chairman, you take charge.
You decide!
You're the manager, and you won't be responsible.
You're not qualified to be manager.
What did you say?
Let me be the mediator.
But if you didn't go into the pump room, we wouldn't have suffered such losses, injuries.
Right?
Do you agree?
We should make a mole hill out of a mountain, pretend it never happened.
Let's start work again.
Don't throw things about!
Don't hide!
Something happens and you don't take responsibility.
Why don't you quit?
O.K. I quit!
I quit.
You make him manager.
I'm leaving!
I'm leaving.
Don't go!
If you go, nobody will look after the factory!
Let me go, I'm leaving!
Don't bull shit anymore, let's quit together.
- Quit...
- What is shouting about?
Don't.
Who are you to hit me!
Get Sing, quick!
Let me hit you first!
Stop!
You guys.
I'm telling you, you have to compensate everybody.
What will we do if they don't?
We'll melt him!
I gave orders for the pump room.
I'll be responsible.
I'm off!
Yam!
Yam!
This is your father's factory, watch it well.
"You are my only love."
"I need not tell you why."
"Nobody can read, the diary in my heart."
"You are all my past and all my future!"
"This diary from then till now,"
"is full of love."
"Wishing the diary will grow."
"The people in it stay."
"Making laughter and poetry together."
"Warm hands to comfort the sorrow!"
"May my heart's diary grow warm."
"Through the grey and cold autumns."
"Those two warm hearts will glow."
Let's eat.
Get up now.
Sorry.
His wife just came back.
You eat first.
Ah Hing, the manager is looking for you!
- Looking for him?
- For me?
He'll fire you!
Promote me?
Yes, we feel you have leadership.
So we're making you Purchasing Manager.
What good judgement.
I never think twice shopping.
Johnny!
Buy him a junior size suit.
Put it on the company account.
Hurry!
Mr. Hing, you look wonderful in a suit.
Don't put on airs.
Start working!
Stop kidding.
Tell them I don't need to work now!
Hold it, Master Hing has been made Manager, from now on, he only gives orders.
Take your time, but don't be lazy!
See you later in the canteen!
Manager?
Why did you hit me?
- Does it hurt?
- Of course!
That means you're not dreaming!
Don't talk too much.
Let's start work!
Give me a piece of cloth.
Forget it, I've got a clean one.
Come out quickly!
Are you serious?
Why not?
I'm being serious too!
We're gonna have serious fun.
Is it fun?
None of my business, the new manager said, to tell you to clean the whole factory.
Sweat?
Sweating is normal.
Young people must sweat, keep it up.
Don't stop!
4 more, 3 more, 2 more, 1 more, no more.
Where's Sunny?
He has a complex because of your success.
He is trying to prove himself right now.
I was going to give him some soya sauce tea.
This is for you.
Health food?
Good for the growing up stage.
Cow's balls.
No thanks!
You have it!
Thanks!
This soup is good for you!
There's some new stock in.
Please sign for it.
My signature?
You said you were serious and now you're angry.
Why are you so small-minded?
Me, small-minded?
You're acting like a small man.
Small?
Did you say I'm small?
That's a personal attack!
Are you two through?
Let's eat!
Eat?
I wouldn't want to eat with the manager.
He doesn't need food.
He's full of TNT!
Says he wants to prove himself.
Manager, all your belongings are here.
I asked you to stay, now I'm asking you to leave.
You think I'd leave because you say so!
You don't own this place.
Jane does.
If Jane asks me to leave, I'll go.
Jane, you never liked him, tell him to go.
You said he has a complex.
He'll get hurt.
You won't tell him?
I'll leave then!
He can stay.
I'll go.
I'm leaving!
No face if you don't leave.
I pity your size.
I'll stay!
You don't have to.
I can take it.
Since you two love fighting one another.
I'll just eat my dinner!
I guess you can't manager to kill one another!
Let's eat!
Let's eat!
You're suffocating me!
Careful of my new Hi-fi.
Help.
This place is mine.
You're bleeding.
Here, clean it up!
- You cut your hand?
- Yeah!
Does it hurt?
Don't know what you two are up to.
One minute friends, the other minute enemies.
Now you're kicking him out.
Where can he go?
Does it hurt?
So careless!
Ah Hing!
I've changed my mind.
Get him back.
Don't wait for the lift.
The stairs.
Hurry, bring him back.
Give me the ball!
He kicked it next door.
That kid's putting us on.
It's the Chick-Chick Team!
Another one up there!
How dare they come here.
Right!
He's so scared he's shaking.
Let me teach you a few tricks!
This is a bonus!
Silly chick!
Go to hell!
Come over here!
What's the matter...?
Now do you dare teach us tricks?
What do you want?
Play us in a match?
A match?
Tomorrow, 7 p.m.
Good!
I'll have an ambulance ready.
Save it for yourselves!
Let's go!
Why don't we get Yam too?
Sure!
Great...!
1,2,3,4!
Don't let it stop!
One!
Great, kid, not bad!
Didn't know you had it in you.
Get away!
Are you home?
Yes...!
What are you doing?
Turning the light on and off.
I'm checking whether the switch is working!
What is it?
Don't turn it on if you've turned it off!
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday...
Oh my God.
Look at you.
I can't believe it.
What happened?
Mom, don't be like that!
Put the cake down.
Mom... calm down!
I was sparring and cut my face.
I'm O.K.
You shocked me so!
Don't ever do it again!
Are you really alright?
I'm fine, mom, you take a rest!
Yam, it's your birthday today.
You have to blow out the candles!
Aren't you going to make a wish?
What's the use?
It never comes true.
Have a little confidence in yourself!
We can start once you're ready.
That shortie is full of himself now!
He doesn't know he's in real trouble.
We'll move all the stock out tonight.
Tomorrow, get him to sign all the bills.
There'll be no stock left and he'll go to jail!
You've really cleaned the factory.
The new manager told me to.
I never did!
No?
The foreman said so.
We've been fooled!
The machine's broken down?
What is it?
I don't know who broke the main's switches.
I told maintenance to fix it.
They're not here yet.
Now the machines are on a go-slow.
Hurry them up, don't just stand there.
Careful or you'll go crazy too!
Tears dropping like rain.
36, 37, 38!
Have you gone mad?
The Manager told me to exercise!
Tears dropping like rain.
Tell them to stop singing.
Labor Law does not say you can't sing at work.
I don't allow it!
O.K. I'll try!
Pretend to be ill and not work!
You Poorman's Nightclub Chorus.
The Manager says you're to stop singing.
Whatever the boss says, we don't hear.
No power again.
You didn't pay the bills, right?
I'm out of power!
The way you're doing, I'm not surprised!
There's a power cut.
Don't card out.
You're off!
I say no!
What are you doing still!
Let's go.
I know it's none of your business.
Who's in charge now?
Did you let them off?
If I quit, I'm in charge.
I quit!
These are out 108 signatures.
Asking for compensation from the competition.
No reply in 24 hours, nobody will work.
Think about it!
No hurry, you can wait still tomorrow.
Cousin, are you alright?
Let's go and have tea!
We are going now.
Now that all the stock has been cleared out.
That shortie has signed half the bills!
What do we do now?
Don't worry.
We'll move everything out tonight.
We might as well burn the place down!
Then there'll be no evidence.
We'll say his daughter and workers didn't get along, the workers did it in revenge.
No one knows about it.
Set a fire?
A fire!
What are you doing with all this petrol?
Go after her!
Miss, this way!
She's over there!
She's inside!
Lock her up!
Tie her up good, don't let her out!
I'm scared!
See the fire!
There's a life at stake?
Hurry!
There's a phone in the room!
What shall we do?
Cut the line!
This is Amy!
Amy, this is Maria!
Yam has gone to play football.
My God!
Call the police!
Help!
Let's go!
Help!
Yam!
What's the matter, Mom?
Don't move!
Your girlfriend is trapped in the warehouse.
Someone has set fire to it.
Go and save her!
Your mom's taken everybody off!
Hurry, let's go!
You can't leave.
I take over here.
Boney M, throw me the ball!
Knock him down!
Go to hell.
You still want to run off?
Where's Amy?
- None of my business?
- Take me to her.
- She's over there!
- Quick!
I was forced to.
I'm innocent!
She's in the opposite room.
Amy!
Don't be afraid!
Calling HQ.
The fire is under control.
We're investigating the premises, over!
The factory will close after a fire like this.
Oh no!
We'll be unemployed again!
We'd have worked for nothing this month.
There won't be any severance pay.
Fellow workers, there is a way out.
We have so many orders.
If we fix the machines, we can start work.
If we deliver, there'll be money for severance pay.
As long as the motors still work.
The motors are gone!
But I have an idea!
How come the engine's gone?
"We are born to have fun."
"No ties, only smiles!"
"I'm not used to being sad."
"I'll chase the sun, as if shot through a gun."
The machines are in order now.
But we don't have any materials.
We'll get friends to help!
That's great.
We can help!
My friends are in trouble, let's check it out!
Hurry...
"Pick a rock to fry eggs on."
"It's easy to be happy."
"You've just gotta have fun."
"I'll hold up the moon to wink to you."
"Put up a tent in the stars and romance with you."
"I'll stop the universe to take a good look at you."
"So that you'll never forget me, Prince Charming."
"Take a tumble in space on a shuttle."
"Tie my eyes and jump hurdles in the skies."
"I'll chase the sun."
"Won't let it go down."
"We are born to have fun."
"No ties, only smiles!"
"I'm not used to being sad."
"I'll chase the sun, as if shot through a gun."
"I'll ride a bike to the moon and sell chop suey."
"It's easy to be happy."
"You've just gotta have fun."
"I'll hold up the moon to wink to you."
"Put up a tent in the stars and romance with you."
"I'll stop the universe to take a good look at you."
"So that you'll never forget me, Prince Charming."
"I am born to have fun."
"No prizes needed just smiles."
"No praises needed.
As long as I still have fun!"
"No praises needed.
As long as I still have fun!"
What?
Put this into gear and move foard.
I'll put it in gear.
Reverse again!
Dad!
Amy!
You two are in trouble.
A Rolls Royce to pay for.
Don't go.
It's O.K. to ruin my car, because you've saved my factory.
I've decided to give you half the shares, the most important thing is to be happy!
As long as we don't let this ship sink!
The car is gone, hurry up!
Don't come closer.
I fired you for what you did to my wife.
Bye...
I am fired already.
- Morning.
- Hiya.
- You look great.
- Thanks.
- Are you ready?
- Hey, I was born ready.
- Who knows that better than you?
- I hope no one.
You know, the amazing thing is, I' m not even nervous.
You just put your garbage in my car.
Hey, hunt.
Today is the big day.
Give 'em hell, boy.
- I' ll give it to 'em.
- We're counting on you.
Mrs barnyak, this face is on the case.
- God bless.
- Thank you.
If I screw this up, this town is dead meat.
- But you're not nervous.
- No.
I' m not.
Oh, god.
You are all weak.
That is why you have been sent here.
Your bosses find you lazy and without confidence.
Hold on, hunt, my man.
On his way to japan!
- Hey, hunt!
- Next stop japan, buddy.
Take a taxi.
You look real good.
I' m glad they sent you, not some city council gumhead.
Yeah.
And, hunt, don't eat any raw shit, ok?
- Wish me luck.
- Go get 'em.
I need assan motors.
Assan motors.
Like I' m driving.
So I get on the train, and here I am.
Guy says to me, "get on the bullet train." So, I get on the bullet train I'm in a rice-field.
...the guy said, "go that way." Then the other guy said, "go that way."
Now I don't know.
Should I go that way?
Thank you very much for everything.
I have learned a lot.
I was a bad executive.
I' ll be a good one.
I have three children and a wife to support.
Please, let me pass.
You are not ready.
You will stay two more weeks.
Excuse me.
Yo, whoa, baby.
Jeez.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.
I' m looking for assan motors.
Anybody know where that is?
I' m really lost.
I don't have a clue where I am.
Am I still in japan?
- You must want executive building.
- Right.
You are in the wrong place.
Ok, where's the right place?
One block over.
Ooh, guess who got out of the wrong side of the bed this morning?
- Nice ribbons.
- Those are ribbons of shame!
I' d wear 'em on the inside if I was you.
Thanks a lot.
Excuse me, you got spit right here.
On the corner of your mouth.
Get the other... it's on the other... thanks a lot.
Hiya, fellas.
Or, as you say hunt stevenson, right here... ok.
Hey, where do I put the screen?
I got a screen here.
Whoa!
Let me just set this down over here.
Don't really need it, after I lugged it about 14,000 miles.
Don't worry about it.
I am crazy for your country.
I mean, I love it.
My dad was here with the army, I guess it was 1940... did you decorate this place yourselves?
'Cause it's damn nice.
It's... real oriental kind of a feel to it.
- Do you speak english?
I' m just curious.
- We all speak english.
Continue, please.
We may as well get started, I know you guys have a long day of... staring ahead of you.
Where are the lights?
Jesus.
Ok, here we go.
This is hadleyville.
There's the factory.
It's been there 35 years.
It's been closed down the past nine months, but two years ago, it was completely retooled.
I tell you, it is in great shape.
Whoa, how did that get in there?
Yikes!
Whoops!
That's hazel lockwash.
Hazel's unit was responsible for putting out over a hundred thousand car engines in one year.
And I think the key word here is "put out".
Putting out.
Ok.
This is... that's... can you turn the lights on?
Look, here's the deal.
Two years ago, the underwear factory closed down in hadleyville.
This was a bummer because you could get underwear there really cheap, good underwear, too, not the kind where the elastic comes out and rubs your butt.
That leaves the auto factory.
The auto factory, then, employed everybody in town.
Everybody owed their living, in some way, to that factory.
These people worked really hard.
Then the factory closed.
If you come and open up that factory, these people will work harder for you.
I tell you, this is a great town, these are great people, and I' m willing to do anything I have to do to get that town back on its feet.
That's my story.
I' m sure you have a lot of questions.
So, go crazy.
I know you don't want to be first 'cause everybody laughs at you.
Don't worry.
Come on.
Ok.
There he is!
Hi, daddy!
Audrey!
I went by your house every day and fed your fish, and... here's all your mail.
Oh, my god.
Baby, please, I' m trying to drive.
- I missed you.
- Yeah, I can tell.
No, I mean, I really missed you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
That's nice.
- Hey, the pizza shop's closed.
- Yeah, yesterday.
And next week the barbershop, the record store.
The only one doing well is the guy who rents u-hauls.
A lot of people are moving.
You haven't said anything about the japanese.
How did it go?
Remember the first time I met your dad?
He came after me with a power sander?
- Yeah.
- It didn't go quite that well.
They should've sent somebody else.
Mr douglas?
Hunt stevenson.
I used to work for you, remember?
I understand you're plant manager up there now.
Congratulations.
I really liked working for you when you were here.
Yeah.
Hey, how's mrs douglas doing?
So, you never hear from her, then?
Oh... termite man, huh?
Yeah.
Well, I' ll tell you the reason I' m calling.
I' m toying with the idea of relocating.
And I was... yeah, so...
I' d go through the local union up there, huh?
Ok.
Hey, how's that dog of yours, rusty?
That frisky little... steam-rollered, huh?
Hunt stevenson, yeah.
No, stevenson.
Yeah, you know me.
We were at the kindergarten together.
No, not you and me, me and your cousin hector.
He used to talk about you all the time at nap time.
That's right.
Listen, ed, here's why I' m calling.
I' m the foreman up here in hadleyville.
I understand you're doing some hiring down in the galveston plant.
Hey, I can jump in a car right now and be down there in 29 hours.
Come on, hunt, forget about it.
You did the best you could.
You did.
Check this out.
Guys, look at this.
Look who's coming.
Heather distefano!
- Who's that guy?
- What?
You like him?
No, I don't like him!
- Hi, boys.
- Hello, heather.
- Hi, hunt.
- Hi, heather.
- God, hunt, she says hello to you?
- She always says hi to me.
She likes me.
In high school, I kept her picture in my locker.
I kept one in my pants, pal.
We've rearranged the produce.
Now, when people are broke, they don't buy meat.
Crackers here, cookies down here.
- Where the kids can see them.
- Gotcha.
Hunt!
Sweetie, you know I enjoy your company, but do you really think it's a good idea to follow me around all day?
Can we talk about this over by the milk?
Hunt, come here!
This is great, I can't believe it.
Come here!
- My eggs.
- Your eggs?
- You ok?
- Yeah.
Great news!
You did it!
I did?
Great!
What'd I do?
- They're coming, next week.
- Who?
Boys!
Do you want me to get the fire hose?
Now, line up and get ready to bow.
Welcome.
Greetings from hadleyville.
I' m the mayor, conrad zwart.
Sorry.
That always happens when I say my name too fast.
Right up here, please.
Thank you for this surprising greeting.
We have many plans.
I' m sorry, I' m not good a speaker as man you sent us.
- Where is mr stevenson?
- Right over there.
Mr stevenson's presentation is a big reason why we are here.
Anybody home?
- Ah, mr stevenson.
What a pleasure.
- How ya doin'?
The door was open, you said two o'clock.
My name is takahara kazihiro, corporate managing director.
Thank you.
Anybody have any subaru or suzukis?
No, ok, go fish.
Now I got it.
I' m trying to remember how I know this guy.
Now I know:
Tokyo.
Right?
I saw you in tokyo.
You were screaming and foaming at the mouth.
Yes, I remember.
What was the deal?
You guys were going crazy.
- Management training programme.
- For executives who are failing.
- Mr stevenson.
- Yeah.
We would like to offer you a new position.
We would like for you to be employee liaison.
Are you shittin' me?
That's great!
This is outline of our company's labour policy.
You're to introduce it to your fellow workers.
Why can't we just run the plant the way we did before?
We did pretty good.
- If you did pretty good, why...?
- Present our ideas.
Do not be influenced by the fact that we are giving you an executive position with a very big raise in pay.
No... why would i?
Don't... no, I won't be influenced by that.
This is great.
- Assuming the factory does open.
- Right.
Well, I already assumed that.
We did not.
Can we count on you?
Fellas is a frog's ass watertight?
Yes, we believe it is.
Work!
Work!
Work!
I know.
I know you want to work.
But, please, let's go over the terms of employment.
May I have your attention, please?
Would you please sit down?
Everyone, sit down.
My name is crandall.
The union sent me 'cause we're concerned about you.
When you walk in without a contract, you are no longer a union.
That's a whole new set of ground rules.
The starting salary is only $8.75 per hour.
- We've been gettin' $11.50!
- We've been gettin' nothing!
- I wanna work!
- All right, work with a contract.
Think they'll give us one?
- I think they will...
- wait!
I' m not asking you.
Time out.
I' m not asking you.
You don't live here.
Looks like you got a job.
I' m asking hunt.
He's one of us.
He knows 'em.
What do you think, hunt?
Hunt!
Hunt!
Hunt!
I think, um...
I think, er... who remembers that high school basketball game at pittsburgh?
Remember that guard for roosevelt, brickhouse?
He averaged 37 points a game.
And, if you'll recall, I was our best defensive player.
Anyway, the coach puts three other guys on him.
He rotates these other three.
He doesn't put me on.
The last quarter, down five, these guys have all fouled out, and brickhouse has 32 points or something ridiculous.
Now, coach pulls me aside, looks me in the eye and says,
"now's the time.
He's yours, take him."
So I took him.
Remember what he scored in the fourth quarter?
Nothing.
Zip.
Zilch.
Point is, you gotta pick your spot.
Now look, we're very lucky to have the japanese over here.
We just gotta know how to play 'em.
Let 'em make some shots.
Then we make our move.
The game, boys, is won in the fourth quarter.
- Hey, hunt!
- Whoa.
Yo.
Come the fourth quarter, can you take these guys like you took brickhouse?
Yeah!
Yeah, I can take 'em.
Let me go in with experienced negotiators.
Hey, hunt, how ya doing?
You look great, really good.
- Hey, I' m off welfare.
- Don't you know it.
Good morning.
Welcome to your first day with assan motors.
Welcome.
We must build spirit, we must be a team.
One, with one purpose only, everyone thinking only of company.
We'll begin with morning exercises.
Jumping jack.
- Begin!
- No!
Mr stevenson.
We're not having a good beginning.
They're not used to getting up in the morning.
I do not blame you.
Even though you are their leader.
Ok.
Sit tight.
- Hunt, take a look at these guys.
- Muchachos.
- I say we do it.
- Bullshit, man.
- Come on.
Why not?
- We never exercise.
This is like the first week in high school.
If you wore jeans you got in trouble.
By october, they didn't care if you wore pants.
Which you didn't sometimes.
One time, ok.
Anyway, do it a couple of days, they'll forget it.
Duck hop.
- Duck hop.
- Ok.
Knee twist.
Hey, come on, don't...
- hey!
- I' m sorry, but no music, no cigar.
Just work.
Here, here, here, here!
- Not here, here...
- what's the difference?
I once did 75 bodies in an hour.
You're jerking us all around here.
Hey, hunt.
Would you get mr moto here off my back?
- He refuses to learn proper... pro...
- the guy can't even say it!
They're moving us all around.
Why can't we do what we know?
Every man learns every job, then we are a team.
No man is special.
Ah, yeah, I got the problem.
Come here.
See, here's the deal on that.
You're in america now, and americans really like to feel special.
- Even him?
- It's go time!
Whoa, wait a minute.
Easy.
- Let's put everybody where they belong.
- He belongs in japan.
There is one way to run this factory.
One way.
Is that so?
I got your one way.
Relax, would you?
Will you take it easy?
You wanna let go of that now?
Defect-o.
That's the dealer's problem.
Every car can't be perfect.
In japan, if there is defect, worker is ashamed.
He stays night to fix.
In japan, goal is zero per cent defect.
How'd you slip by?
- Gooseman, what's the matter?
- He took my paper.
So what?
You'll give it back, right?
Wrong.
He said we can't take papers into the head.
Can he have the paper back?
See, we encourage google to read.
Hunt!
We gotta talk.
Wait, willie, I' m in the middle of something.
- I gave you the afternoon off.
- I cleared it with you, right?
- Will you give me a second?
- We're talking here.
- So, I' m going out and they stop me.
- Who?
The rice-a-ronI patrol.
They say if I leave, it'll count against me.
My kid is getting his tonsils out, he's scared.
- I promised him I' d be there.
- Ok.
- You're reading, good.
So, what about it?
- Hold on.
Thanks.
We'll talk about this later.
- No newspaper.
- Yeah, well, ok.
We'll talk about it.
I' ll go to the office, talk to number one san.
- A lot of guys have been complaining.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Go see your kid.
American car.
Hey, wild bunch!
- Hey, sugar-puss, what's cooking?
- No cooking, typing.
Ok, where's your boss?
Today not a good day to see boss-man.
He between a rock and a hard-on.
No shit.
Whoa, I gotta see this.
- Hi, boss.
- Ah, mr stevenson.
Hey, please, hunt, ok?
Or the hunter, if you like.
- Can I help you?
- You probably can.
- How does your family like america?
- I didn't ask.
Speaking of your family - and I really can't wait to meet them any of your kids ever have any surgery?
- What?
You know my friend willie, guy that works downstairs?
His kid's going to have his tonsils out.
Willie'd really like to be there 'cause he's this superdad or something.
- He lives for his kids.
- But work suffers.
Let's talk about work.
I think I can help out.
You know this zero-defect deal?
- No?
- Nah.
Work, work, you'll go nuts.
I had a cousin, mary elizabeth, checked out of reality, never to return.
She worked.
That's gonna happen to you guys.
It's just cars, not brain surgery.
I see what you are saying.
Hey, there we go.
Got that settled.
Good.
A load off my mind.
A few more things and I' ll get out of your hair, which looks good, I mean that.
Oh, thank you.
My brother's a barber, and before I left japan... that's interesting.
Anyway, you know your number two, saito?
This guy doesn't work and play well with others, if you ask me.
- What is this stuff?
- Seaweed.
Mr saito is not a typical japanese.
I' ll tell you something.
I' d dump him.
Really, if it was me, I' d lose him.
Outta there.
He's the nephew of my boss.
Whoa, that could be tough, huh?
Then just get him to lighten up, he's a real pain in the ass.
We have our own way of making cars.
Let the guys do what they do best.
- I see what you are saying.
- Great!
We're cooking.
You know what?
You're a guy I can talk to.
How often?
- You guys don't play softball, do you?
- We play baseball.
I' ve heard of softball.
We need a practice game saturday, wanna come play?
- What time?
- Two.
- If we're not busy.
- Ok.
We just play for beer.
- So do we.
- And afterwards, we piss for distance.
For us, it's accuracy.
The kazmonaut.
Oh, man.
They look like the yankees.
I hate 'em already.
Mr stevenson.
Kaz-man.
Here you go, babe.
- You look good.
- Thank you.
We just need to warm up.
- Sure.
Hey, nice glove.
- It's a haseo makasakI model.
- Oh.
I' ve got a merv griffin model here.
- That's good.
What is this crap?
Boys, play ball.
I' m gonna put a stop to this crap.
Here we go.
Let's see a little bunt now.
Come on, whale killer.
Let's see a bunt.
Last inning, hunt.
Two runs from winning.
Bases loaded, hunt.
Come on now.
Give it some stick.
Two runs, we win.
All right.
See the ball, hunt.
- See the ball.
- Hit it on the ground.
Goddamn.
All right!
Two runs scored, we win!
The guy should've faced that.
- You ok?
- Yeah.
It was a good game.
We had fun.
Look, I' m really sorry, man.
He's fine.
All over the base, man.
- Showed him, huh?
- Yeah, you showed him.
- Practise your english.
- Tomorrow is the boy's birthday.
- I bought him a bicycle.
- Fine.
At sears, where america shops.
I cannot put it together.
Here are the instructions.
- Not tonight.
- I want him to see it when he wakes up.
- Kazihiro.
- I' m working!
I have no time.
Why do american fathers have time?
Why?
Because their work sucks.
You leave my mother out of this!
It's your boss, mr sakamoto.
No sir, I did not raise production.
It is down another 3½ per cent this month.
Yes, I' m very sorry, sir.
Hey, look who's back.
Hey, pea-brain, what's going on?
- Tony, where'd they put you?
- Right here.
- On these guns?
- On this spot.
They're gonna reassign you, they told me to tell you.
Hunt, I bet I' m getting your old job.
- Foreman, right?
- Bet that's it.
Hear that, you fartheads?
I' m getting off the line here.
- Mr...
- hershiser.
Mr hershiser!
- Yo.
- We have a new position for you.
Ah, yeah.
That's what I heard.
We are understaffed in the, ah, custodial department.
We are transferring you there.
Your pay will be the same.
Please continue.
Hey, yo, made-ln-japan.
What am I supposed to do with this?
That should be obvious.
We expect you to sweep.
Hey, come here.
He knocks you down, so you make him sweep up?
No.
Not personal.
He has more defects than any other worker in the factory.
It was kazihiro's decision.
A very good one.
- Oh, yeah?
Defects, is that it?
- Wait.
Hold on.
You're doing a great job.
We're shit on their shoes.
This is just for a while.
Just hang in there.
I' m going to kazihiro's for dinner this weekend.
- Dinner, sounds great.
- No, no.
I' m gonna lay down the law.
- I' m quitting.
- How can you quit?
I' ll kick the japanese crap out of him.
- Wait, you've got two kids.
- I' m not taking this.
You gotta take it.
Everybody's looking at me.
What am I supposed to do?
You're supposed to take care of your family.
That's what you're supposed to do.
Let 'em look.
It doesn't matter what they think.
Let's go.
Let's go, get back to work.
This is delicious.
- What do you call this?
- Meatloaf.
You could not tell?
Well, you know, I' m thinking to myself,
"this tastes a little bit like meatloaf, but it's too delicious to be meatloaf."
In fact, audrey leaned over and said to me, "honey, can I have some of yours?"
What, am I gonna say no?
I love her, I' m gonna give it to her.
There you are.
Whoops!
- Thanks.
- Sure.
- Are we ready for dessert?
- Oh, boy, I know I am.
In a few minutes.
Right now, we have some business to discuss.
- Hey, audrey.
- What?
Why don't you... you know...
leave?
Actually, I' m interested in what's going on at the plant.
Nobody minds if I stay, right?
See.
Mr stevenson... hunt.
How do you think things are going at the factory?
- Honestly, kaz?
- Yes, please.
Not too well.
See, you're stateside now.
But you still act like yokohama mamas.
No offence.
- None taken.
- Can I be frank for a second?
I' ve heard a lot of talk about how good the japanese businessmen are.
Frankly...
I' m sorry, I don't get it.
I don't see it, I' m not impressed.
Not one iota.
- You're fired.
- What?
You can't fire me!
You'll go back on the line with the others.
Wait a minute.
Explain this to me.
Why?
I do not understand american workers.
They arrive late, they leave early, stay home when they are sick.
They put themselves above company.
You seem to feel the same way.
Ok, but explain something to me.
When this was an american factory, production was 10% higher than now.
Ten per cent?
In japan, production in same size factory is 40% higher.
With superior quality.
- Impossible.
How can you work so fast?
- Japanese worker is very loyal.
He's very proud when company does well.
- He's ashamed when it does poorly.
- Like now.
In japan, when production lags, worker stays longer in factory.
Ok, overtime.
Time-and-a-half is standard.
They do not do it for pay.
They do it for company.
Yeah, but that's there, this is here.
Gentlemen, this is an american factory.
They won't go for that.
Is that how you feel, that they'll never go for it?
There's one guy who can get 'em to go for it, and you're looking at him.
You can change their attitude?
- If I can't, nobody can.
- Nobody can.
Hey, would you shut up?
Goddamn.
Ok.
You guys have a problem, right?
I' m the answer man.
I can work this out and make everybody happy, I always have.
Come on, you gotta give me a shot.
All right.
We make no more changes for now.
There you go.
Yeah.
Hey, hon... wanna stop off and get some ice cream?
Haagen-dazs.
Eat shit and die.
- You having your period?
- Stop the car.
How could you do that to me?
Telling me to shut up in front of all those people!
I' m dealing with a delicate situation.
- So, what are you trying to do?
- I' m trying to save jobs.
The only job I heard being threatened was yours.
They picked me for this job.
I didn't ask for it.
They need me.
They need to know where things stand.
They don't need a guy who's trying to do it all by himself.
It'd be pretty nice to have a girlfriend who's supportive of me.
Supportive?
You mean some chick who'll go along with everything you say.
- A parrot with tits.
- How can you bring heather into this?
I wasn't thinking of heather.
But apparently you were.
Oh, audrey, come on.
Come on, audrey!
- Morning!
- Where did you come from?
I' ve been swimming down below you the whole time.
- Is there anyone else down there?
- There might be.
You know, boys, now I' ve got you all together,
I' ve been thinking it over.
You know what we need?
An incentive programme.
We don't need an incentive programme.
We need faster workers.
We need a fish to bite your pecker off.
What's the most cars you guys ever turned out in one month in japan?
Fifteen thousand.
All right, my men will make 15,000 cars next month.
But when they do, you give them their old salaries and you guarantee 'em full employment.
We got a deal?
- I' m not sure if...
- what have you got to lose?
All right.
We strike a deal.
Fifteen thousand cars, not any less.
One less than fifteen thousand, no raise, nothing.
I' m starting to like this ritual.
You know, this is really hard for me to say, but I got to tell you something, man.
The american worker is really second best, I' m sorry.
The japanese can do everything better, faster and longer.
You don't like to hear that, do you?
Neither do i, 'cause it's bullshit.
- Who's better than us?
- Nobody!
- Who?
- Nobody!
You bet your red, white and blue ass.
When they told me no americans could ever match the amount of cars made by the japanese in one month it took about a dozen guys to hold my ass down.
I said, "not only will we make more cars than you, when we break your record,
"I expect full employment here."
I' m talking about 200 more of our union brothers and sisters back to work.
And like I told you months ago, at $11.50 an hour.
Hey, hunt, how many cars for the record?
How many?
How many?
Fifteen thousand cars in one month.
That's 15,000 in a month.
Did you say 15,000?
Are you joking, or what?
No, I' m not kidding.
Come on, we can do that.
Can't we?
Are you saying the japanese are better than us?
- But 15,000, that's a lot of work.
- What if we come in just under 15,000?
We get nothing for all that work.
What kind of deal is that?
Excuse me, fellas, but the man's not an idiot.
He wouldn't let that happen.
Hey, of course not.
Even if we just come close, we get something, right?
- All right.
- Like half a raise for 13,000?
For 13,000, yeah.
Why didn't you tell us that from the beginning?
'Cause I just thought of it.
'Cause I just thought...
I thought it'd be better to concentrate on the full fifteen and that way get the whole raise.
Let's not even think about 13,000.
Let's not even talk about it.
Let's pretend I just made this crazy thing up about 13,000 cars.
That way, we just go for the full fifteen.
I say we can do it.
Let's do it and do it our way.
- Can we do it?
- Yeah!
- Oh, come on, man.
Can we do it?
- Yeah!
Can we do it?
Yes, yes, yes!
It won't be easy.
We gotta do what the japanese do.
If they fall behind, they stay after hours.
They work late.
They show up early.
- Hey!
- Morning.
Sometimes the workers ask for the line to be speeded up.
They cut down on lunch hours and breaks.
They save time any way they can.
If they can do it, we can do it.
Tony, do you need two hands to scratch your ass?
Let's work.
- We gotta talk.
- Not now, we'll fall behind.
Two bumpers on a car, not one.
- Hunt, listen.
- What?
We got it.
We're gonna get the raise!
There you go!
I figured it out, 13,000 cars.
All we do is work the rest of the month eight hours a day like always.
13,000?
That's good.
But, see, you can't think like that, 'cause then we don't make the 15,000.
- We ain't gonna make that anyway.
- Then we gotta work harder.
- This is sunday!
- Ok.
I haven't seen my kids in two weeks, how can you say that?
- I know, but...
- we're gonna make the 13,000.
We're gonna make the raise and a lot of us are satisfied with that.
Do you believe that guy?
- Excuse me.
- You're excused.
- Hey, buster, what's going on?
- Just doin' some shopping.
- Mr stevenson.
- Hi.
Want something from here?
She wants something, but she's not having much luck getting it.
Here you go.
Hey, look...
I know you're drunk and things aren't going well, but why don't you lighten up?
Why don't you just kiss her ass like you do her husband every day?
Mommy, mommy!
Clean up in aisle three.
Sorry, man.
My wife told me what had happened and I am grateful.
Oh, gee.
Hey, do me a favour, don't fire the guy.
He's really been very unhappy lately.
I will not fire him.
You are good friend to him.
Yeah.
You didn't see him sprawled out across the cheese puffs.
Still, you are his friend.
In japan I have many friends.
We only talk about cars or do exercises.
But sometimes we go see a sumo game.
But that's in japan.
- Well, once again, thank you very much.
- Ok.
Hey, wanna go get a beer?
Right there, what's that?
- I don't know.
- That's two men walking a breast!
I got one for you.
This is a one-eared elephant.
Wait a minute, there's a church league here.
Reverend... one-eared elephant.
Put him back in the zoo.
We're going to jail before the night's over.
- What a laugh we're having, huh?
- Yeah, good raughs.
I guess I' ve got things running pretty well at the factory, right?
Mr saito is major fuckhead.
I beg your pardon.
He calls japan and tells them that I am losing control here.
- One more failure and I am ruined.
- What do you mean, one more?
Remember when you first saw me?
Yeah, at the screaming academy.
You were enrolled there, I think.
The place for failures.
- I am not a good leader.
- You are.
No, I am not.
I used to worry that men were working too hard, missing their families.
I worried that they were not getting personal satisfaction from their work.
You animal.
- You make jokes.
- No, I' m not.
I had to make a shimatsusho for workers.
- You had to cook for those guys?
- No, an apology.
I had to apologise to the workers for letting their production fall behind.
I begged for their forgiveness.
They were all humiliated because of me.
The only measure of a worker's value is the work.
The company is everything.
Team!
That is what has raised us from a conquered nation to an economic power.
- We are one, with one purpose.
- You guys are doing great, I admit it.
He'll be back.
There's a midnight show.
One more failure and I' m ruined.
I got troubles, bud.
You think you have troubles.
I have troubles with hair on 'em.
Listen, I told the guys there might be a partial raise if we made 13,000 cars this month.
- You told them that?
- I know.
You shouldn't drink if you find that funny.
I find it totally depressing.
You're right.
You're right!
I am?
Hey!
- Are you shittin' me?
- No.
You are in more trouble than me.
I feel much better.
It's jammed, goog.
Call maintenance.
- No good, I say two hours.
- Good, I could use a break.
You could?
You've had five months break, you should be pretty rested.
I' m getting very sick of you.
What do you want from us?
We eat, sleep and piss on the line!
- Shut off the line!
- Shut that goddamn line off!
- You ok?
- I tried to unjam it.
I didn't want us to lose time.
Back off, will you, hunt?
This is your fault to begin with.
- Bad timing, huh?
- Bad for you.
What happened?
Why have they stopped?
One of the workers had an accident.
Why are the others not working?
Back to work.
Back to work!
A man has been hurt.
You may be next.
Excuse me.
This is for mr googleman.
How is he?
- He's fine.
We're going in to see him.
- I' m happy.
That's the main thing, as long as you're happy.
He's happy they only have to give us half the raise.
- Half the raise?
- For making 13,000 cars in a month.
That is not so.
It was 15,000 or no raise.
We just talked to that guy lto.
We found out there's no raise for 13,000 cars.
I' m calling all the guys and we're coming over to get you.
Oh, shit!
Hygiene... get in there, you ungrateful little... get in!
Defects!
- No raise for 13,000 cars.
- You going somewhere?
- No.
- Let's get this over with.
You hear what I said?
There is no raise for 13,000 cars.
All right.
Look, fellas... now, listen...
- here's what happened.
- We know what happened.
They made a deal with you, then they broke it.
Those sons of bitches!
They did make that deal, didn't they?
Yeah, they made a deal with me!
The sons of bitches.
Union meeting, tomorrow.
But first, we're going up to see that...
- what's his name?
- Kazihiro.
...katzihiro on our lunch hour.
- Come with us, call him a liar.
I' ll do better than that, I' ll get there before you.
I' ll have this settled before you arrive.
That's what separates us from the japanese.
- We got you looking out for us.
- Hey, fellas, I' m just doing...
- let's go get a couple of brewskis.
- I' m buying'.
- Hey, I' m sorry...
- no, it was me.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
I got kind of a... come for a few beers.
Let's talk about it there.
No, you go ahead, i... come on, come on.
I ought to stay.
I' ll talk to you later.
Yeah?
All right.
Don't feed anabelle.
No more mtv.
No more twisted sister.
Read a book!
More jimmy dean pure pork sausage?
No!
No more jimmy dean, no more hawaiian punch.
No more green giant frozen niblets.
Who the hell can that be?
Yes?
May we come in?
Yes.
Please... come in.
Sit.
Please sit...
- can I get you anything?
- No.
GI joe!
That is neighbour's child.
Everything is all right here?
Yes.
Fine, great!
Well, have a nice trip back.
I will come to the factory tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow is not good day.
- Why not?
Factory is locked and we can't find key.
Bullshit-o!
The men are having a big union meeting tomorrow night.
Is this true?
- Yes.
- This does not make me very happy.
You have let me down.
Come, nephew.
I am tired.
Uncle... you can stay at my place.
- Is your wife with you?
- Yes.
Ramada inn.
- We gotta talk.
- You're telling me, brother.
My men are expecting a raise, I gotta get 'em one.
- You shouldn't have lied.
- I thought we'd make the quota.
And I figured if we didn't, you'd be man enough to give them something.
We're a thousand lousy cars short.
Impossible.
Tell them not to form a union or mr sakamoto will be displeased.
Good idea.
I should've thought of that.
I' ll go down and talk to the guys and say,
"we shouldn't form a union, 'cause that would displease mr sakamoto."
You said you could control your men.
You put me in very bad situation.
I bailed your ass out I don't know how many times.
What do you think kept them going this long?
Your charm?
It was me.
I backed you, I handed you 14,000 cars, and now I' m gonna look like shit.
Give my men a raise!
If I do, mr sakamoto will have a baby.
Working conditions must stay as they are.
Tell them that.
- Now who's nuts?
- Not us.
We know what we're doing.
I see now why they gave me ribbons of shame.
- I was thinking like an american.
- Don't flatter yourself, ace.
It's true.
Everybody here thinks they are special.
Nobody works for the team.
They're too busy getting personalised licence plates.
You wouldn't last two days in management training programme.
We wouldn't be stupid enough to stay two days.
Because you are selfish, it's what makes you weak.
I' m weak?
You don't have the guts to stand up to your boss.
You're a real millie, you know that?
I am no millie!
Get out of here!
You're fired!
- You don't work here any more!
- I' m fired?
That's great.
Fine with me.
You think you're so hot.
This factory's running like shit.
It's run our way!
The way we know how!
This is the way!
Oh, yeah?
If you're so great, how come you lost the big one?
- Come on.
- Whoa, break it up, hunt.
- He's nuts.
- Take it easy.
- We'll work it out at the meeting.
- I don't need any meeting.
I' m through right now.
- Anybody else need a meeting?
- No!
All right, let's walk.
Welcome to the hadleyville fourth of july picnic.
Lots of fun for everybody, and don't forget the big fireworks show tonight.
Gotta give it to you, hunt.
You said you'd handle 'em in the fourth quarter.
They lied to you, but you didn't let 'em get away with it.
That was great.
Top notch, hunt.
Good evening.
May I have your attention, please?
Is hunt stevenson here?
Hunt stevenson?
Come on up here, son.
The man who saved hadleyville.
We'll stay out till we get the raise!
Have I got a piece of news for you.
I just got official word from assan motors.
The factory is closed.
What?
- A lockout?
- No bright boy, not a lockout, a pull-out.
A close-down, an adiós, a "sayonara, round-eyes".
They said the workers, and especially their leadership, were too difficult to deal with.
So they're closing the factory and going back to japan.
The man who saved hadleyville.
You're the man who killed hadleyville, and I' m gonna kill you!
Wait a minute.
Why are you blaming hunt?
He tried like hell, then they made a deal and weaselled out.
Let me tell you something.
We are behind you, hunt. 100%.
If you buy that, you all stay here and starve with him.
Fuck you!
Quiet!
Your friend hunt's trying to speak.
Go ahead, hunt.
First of all, I think you all should know something.
See... gee, I don't know, I figure we made fifteen... you know... if we made 13,000 cars, we'd be so close to 15,000, right?
- That if we...
- hunt.
- What are you trying to tell us?
- Yeah!
- I lied.
- My god.
Yeah, there was no... there was no deal for 13,000 cars.
We walked out on a lie?
I never in a million years thought it could lead to this, I swear.
- You should've told us the truth.
- The truth?
You don't want the truth.
You want to hear that americans are better than anybody else.
They're kicking our butts, that ain't luck.
There's your truth.
Sure, the great old american do-or-die spirit.
Yeah, it's alive.
But they've got it.
I tell you, we'd better get it back.
We'd better get it back damn fast.
Instead, we're strutting around telling ourselves how great we are.
I guess if I was really a leader, I would've told you this months ago.
Instead, I was telling you basketball stories.
I put myself in front of the town and I' m really sorry.
I swear to you, man, I' m really sorry.
Ito-san's wife is in labour.
He would like to go.
You want to leave?
No, sir.
I want to stay and work.
This is looney tunes.
Looney tunes?
That's all, folks!
- We are insane!
- Why are you talking american?
Because I have american idea.
We work too damn hard.
This is not our lives.
This is a factory.
Our friends, our families should be our lives.
We are killing ourselves.
We are millies.
Many of you are troubled by the same things as me, huh?
Tell him.
Tell him that we have things we can learn from americans.
Need any help?
I went by your house.
How come you're still out here?
Couldn't go home.
Somebody filled my car with horse manure.
- Who would do that?
- I don't know.
I don't think it was a horse.
Hunt, i...
I came to tell you you were great tonight.
It took a lot of guts to say what you said, and I was really proud of you.
Do you think I could possibly have a hug?
Oh, god.
Right on this bridge is where I first kissed you.
Yep.
Jesus!
That's kazihiro.
What's he doing here?
Hey!
You look good.
- Did you join a health club?
- I came out here to be alone.
In japan, you're never alone.
You put on your pants, there's someone in there.
It's almost that bad here.
Yeah, I need this.
I' m ruined.
I destroyed my career.
You're ruined?
There's 1,200 families in this town that are ruined... you jag-off.
I let down myself, I let down my men.
I wiped out your town.
I can't stand it any more.
Nice talkin' to you.
Jeez!
Hey, are you nuts?
If you're gonna drown yourself, at least take off your watch.
I' m not drowning myself, I' m just freaking out!
Are you guys ok?
Yeah, we're all right.
Kazmania here was trying to swim back to japan.
Ok.
I' ll wait for you up here.
- You ok?
- Yes.
Come on.
You're a maniac.
- Last night, I told my boss off.
- Oh, yeah.
Good for you.
Was he awake?
Are you kidding?
I was on him good.
I was on him like hair on a gorilla.
- Where do you get these expressions?
- Tv.
You're coming around, kazmonaut.
Took you long enough.
Yes, we screwed this up good.
Ah, dammit.
You know when you think of all the shit we did wrong, and it's an impressive amount, we were this close to pulling this thing off.
This close to doing it.
Well, look.
I made some big mistakes.
Is it just me, or do you hate the way wet shorts feel?
- I actually kind of like it.
- Really?
What a waste.
- This could've been big.
- That's what kills me.
Yes, I feel like you.
I' d love another chance.
I know we could do better.
Get outta here.
- Where do you think you're going?
- I' m going to work.
Hey, hey.
What work?
They shut down.
Why are you with him?
Kaz?
He's going back to work with me.
- Aren't you in enough trouble?
- Where's your uncle?
Ramada inn coffee shop, eating pancakes.
Tell him we made a deal with these men.
By 7.30 tomorrow, there will be 15,000 cars.
If he's a man of honour, he'll keep his promise and give these men their raises.
Certainly.
I will tell him you said that.
Now!
My wife had baby girl!
Congratulations.
We still got 1,000 cars to build, thought we'd go knock 'em off.
- 1,000 cars.
Two of you.
- We're gonna skip lunch.
This shouldn't be too bad.
Hell, these at the end of the line here are almost done.
- Well, what are they doing?
- They're building a car.
Hey, hunt.
This whole thing is an insult to my intelligence, man.
- Is that possible?
- Really, I' m serious.
All right, ha, ha.
He thinks if we see him working, we'll rush in and help.
Ok.
There's one.
- What'd that take us, twenty minutes?
- Four hours.
Why?
Just tell me, why is he doing it?
He wants to look good for the japs.
He's covering his ass.
- I don't buy that.
- Give me another reason.
I tell you what, maybe he's just trying to save this town.
Hey, hunt.
We're here.
Yes!
No, no, no.
Not everywhere.
Here, here, here and here.
Got it?
We could use another man on the wipers.
Hunt, sakamoto-san is here.
How are things going?
- Ito says we're short.
- It's close.
We're going so fast, it's hard to keep count.
But we look short.
Ok.
By seven-thirty, he's going to start counting cars.
- While he counts the cars...
- we keep building.
Good idea.
Boys, on the last few, we may have to cut a few corners.
All right?
Just little things like... engines.
Maybe I will not take the trouble to count.
I understand you question my honour.
I did not question it, I counted on it.
Human forklift comin' through.
Get this one down off the jack.
No, one bolt, not four bolts.
Don't count this one.
Pat, don't bolt 'em on, just stick 'em on.
We'll do that tomorrow.
14,994.
That's all.
That's not enough.
Wait a minute.
We still have cars inside.
Why didn't you bring them out?
Good question.
Let's go find out.
He's coming!
Hey!
Where you fellas been?
We've been standing around here for a couple of hours waiting for you cowboys.
There you go!
Well, there they are.
More than enough.
Drinks are on me.
Safety glass.
Ow!
My head!
I' ll make a list of everything that is wrong with these cars.
Hey, wait a minute.
Are you leaving?
- Yes.
- Just like that?
You were six cars short.
Oh, ok.
Six cars short.
Ok.
I tell you, you're making a big mistake.
Why did you say that?
Why do I say that?
- Let's talk about the pittsburgh game.
- Oh, my god!
We're down 16 points going into the 4th quarter.
People got up and left.
They missed the greatest comeback in the history of that tournament.
- Do you get my point?
- Not at all.
If you walk out that door, you're going to miss a great comeback.
We're ready to roll here, jack.
This will never be like a japanese factory, jack.
Oh, yeah?
You're right.
You know what else?
So what?
You failed.
Really?
You know what?
I got one of the first cars ever made here.
The first car.
I don't think I want it any more.
As a matter of fact, here, why don't you take the keys?
I' d rather have one of those cars.
I' d rather have one of these cars we made together by hand.
Your guys and my guys, together.
You know why?
'Cause those cars stand for something.
Those cars stand for something pretty great.
I' m proud of those cars.
I' m taking one.
Gentlemen...
I' m going home in my new car.
I thought it handled great.
Here, uncle, here is everything that is substandard on all these cars.
That's some list!
Good team.
Good men.
You will fix those before they leave the factory.
I will.
I will?
I like you.
You make me laugh.
I don't see anything wrong with these cars.
Are you crazy?
Congrat-lation!
Fifteen thousand cars.
Nephew.
Good luck in your new job.
Let's rock.
- Morning.
- Hiya.
- You look great.
- Thanks.
- Are you ready?
- Hey, I was born ready.
- Who knows that better than you?
- I hope no one.
You know, the amazing thing is, I'm not even nervous.
You just put your garbage in my car.
Hey, Hunt.
Today is the big day.
Give 'em hell, boy.
- I'll give it to 'em.
- We're counting on you.
Mrs. Barnyak, this face is on the case.
- God bless.
- Thank you.
If I screw this up, this town is dead meat.
- But you're not nervous.
- No.
I'm not.
Oh, god.
You are all weak.
That is why you have been sent here.
Your bosses find you lazy and without confidence.
Hold on, Hunt, my man.
On his way to Japan!
- Hey, Hunt!
- Next stop Japan, buddy.
Take a taxi.
You look real good.
I'm glad they sent you, not some city council gumhead.
Yeah.
And, Hunt, don't eat any raw shit, ok?
- Wish me luck.
- Go get 'em.
I need Assan motors.
Assan motors.
Like I'm driving.
So I get on the train, and here I am.
Guy says to me, "get on the bullet train." So, I get on the bullet train I'm in a rice-field.
...the guy said, "go that way." Then the other guy said, "go that way."
Now I don't know.
Should I go that way?
Thank you very much for everything.
I have learned a lot.
I was a bad executive.
I'll be a good one.
I have three children and a wife to support.
Please, let me pass.
You are not ready.
You will stay two more weeks.
Excuse me.
Yo, whoa, baby.
Jeez.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.
I'm looking for Assan motors.
Anybody know where that is?
I'm really lost.
I don't have a clue where I am.
Am I still in Japan?
- You must want executive building.
- Right.
You are in the wrong place.
OK, where's the right place?
One block over.
Ooh, guess who got out of the wrong side of the bed this morning?
- Nice ribbons.
- Those are ribbons of shame!
I'd wear 'em on the inside if I was you.
Thanks a lot.
Excuse me, you got spit right here.
On the corner of your mouth.
Get the other... it's on the other... thanks a lot.
Hiya, fellas.
Or, as you say Hunt Stevenson, right here... ok.
Hey, where do I put the screen?
I got a screen here.
Whoa!
Let me just set this down over here.
Don't really need it, after I lugged it about 14,000 miles.
Don't worry about it.
I am crazy for your country.
I mean, I love it.
My dad was here with the army, I guess it was 1940... did you decorate this place yourselves?
'Cause it's damn nice.
It's... real oriental kind of a feel to it.
- Do you speak english?
I'm just curious.
- We all speak english.
Continue, please.
We may as well get started, I know you guys have a long day of... staring ahead of you.
Where are the lights?
Jesus.
OK, here we go.
This is Hadleyville.
There's the factory.
It's been there 35 years.
It's been closed down the past nine months, but two years ago, it was completely retooled.
I tell you, it is in great shape.
Whoa, how did that get in there?
Yikes!
Whoops!
That's hazel lockwash.
Hazel's unit was responsible for putting out over a hundred thousand car engines in one year.
And I think the key word here is "put out".
Putting out.
OK.
This is... that's... can you turn the lights on?
Look, here's the deal.
Two years ago, the underwear factory closed down in Hadleyville.
This was a bummer because you could get underwear there really cheap, good underwear, too, not the kind where the elastic comes out and rubs your butt.
That leaves the auto factory.
The auto factory, then, employed everybody in town.
Everybody owed their living, in some way, to that factory.
These people worked really hard.
Then the factory closed.
If you come and open up that factory, these people will work harder for you.
I tell you, this is a great town, these are great people, and I'm willing to do anything I have to do to get that town back on its feet.
That's my story.
I'm sure you have a lot of questions.
So, go crazy.
I know you don't want to be first 'cause everybody laughs at you.
Don't worry.
Come on.
OK.
There he is!
Hi, daddy!
Audrey!
I went by your house every day and fed your fish, and... here's all your mail.
Oh, my god.
Baby, please, I'm trying to drive.
- I missed you.
- Yeah, I can tell.
No, I mean, I really missed you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
That's nice.
- Hey, the pizza shop's closed.
- Yeah, yesterday.
And next week the barbershop, the record store.
The only one doing well is the guy who rents u-hauls.
A lot of people are moving.
You haven't said anything about the Japanese.
How did it go?
Remember the first time I met your dad?
He came after me with a power sander?
- Yeah.
- It didn't go quite that well.
They should've sent somebody else.
Mr. Douglas?
Hunt Stevenson.
I used to work for you, remember?
I understand you're plant manager up there now.
Congratulations.
I really liked working for you when you were here.
Yeah.
Hey, how's Mrs. Douglas doing?
So, you never hear from her, then?
Oh... termite man, huh?
Yeah.
Well, I'll tell you the reason I'm calling.
I'm toying with the idea of relocating.
And I was... yeah, so...
I'd go through the local union up there, huh?
OK.
Hey, how's that dog of yours, rusty?
That frisky little... steam-rollered, huh?
Hunt Stevenson, yeah.
No, Stevenson.
Yeah, you know me.
We were at the kindergarten together.
No, not you and me, me and your cousin hector.
He used to talk about you all the time at nap time.
That's right.
Listen, ed, here's why I'm calling.
I'm the foreman up here in Hadleyville.
I understand you're doing some hiring down in the galveston plant.
Hey, I can jump in a car right now and be down there in 29 hours.
Come on, Hunt, forget about it.
You did the best you could.
You did.
Check this out.
Guys, look at this.
Look who's coming.
Heather distefano!
- Who's that guy?
- What?
You like him?
No, I don't like him!
- Hi, boys.
- Hello, Heather.
- Hi, Hunt.
- Hi, Heather.
- God, Hunt, she says hello to you?
- She always says hl to me.
She likes me.
In high school, I kept her picture in my locker.
I kept one in my pants, pal.
We've rearranged the produce.
Now, when people are broke, they don't buy meat.
Crackers here, cookies down here.
- Where the kids can see them.
- Gotcha.
Hunt!
Sweetie, you know I enjoy your company, but do you really think it's a good idea to follow me around all day?
Can we talk about this over by the milk?
Hunt, come here!
This is great, I can't believe it.
Come here!
- My eggs.
- Your eggs?
- You ok?
- Yeah.
Great news!
You did it!
I did?
Great!
What'd I do?
- They're coming, next week.
- Who?
Boys!
Do you want me to get the fire hose?
Now, line up and get ready to bow.
Welcome.
Greetings from Hadleyville.
I'm the mayor, conrad zwart.
Sorry.
That always happens when I say my name too fast.
Right up here, please.
Thank you for this surprising greeting.
We have many plans.
I'm sorry, I'm not good a speaker as man you sent us.
- Where is Mr. Stevenson?
- Right over there.
Mr. Stevenson's presentation is a big reason why we are here.
Anybody home?
- Ah, Mr. Stevenson.
What a pleasure.
- How ya doin'?
The door was open, you said two o'clock.
My name is takahara Kazihiro, corporate managing director.
Thank you.
Anybody have any subaru or suzukis?
No, ok, go fish.
Now I got it.
I'm trying to remember how I know this guy.
Now I know:
Tokyo.
Right?
I saw you in tokyo.
You were screaming and foaming at the mouth.
Yes, I remember.
What was the deal?
You guys were going crazy.
- Management training programme.
- For executives who are failing.
- Mr. Stevenson.
- Yeah.
We would like to offer you a new position.
We would like for you to be employee liaison.
Are you shittin' me?
That's great!
This is outline of our company's labour policy.
You're to introduce it to your fellow workers.
Why can't we just run the plant the way we did before?
We did pretty good.
- If you did pretty good, why...?
- Present our ideas.
Do not be influenced by the fact that we are giving you an executive position with a very big raise in pay.
No... why would I?
Don't... no, I won't be influenced by that.
This is great.
- Assuming the factory does open.
- Right.
Well, I already assumed that.
We did not.
Can we count on you?
Fellas is a frog's ass watertight?
Yes, we believe it is.
Work!
Work!
Work!
I know.
I know you want to work.
But, please, let's go over the terms of employment.
May I have your attention, please?
Would you please sit down?
Everyone, sit down.
My name is crandall.
The union sent me 'cause we're concerned about you.
When you walk in without a contract, you are no longer a union.
That's a whole new set of ground rules.
The starting salary is only $8.75 per hour.
- We've been gettin' $11.50!
- We've been gettin' nothing!
- I wanna work!
- All right, work with a contract.
Think they'll give us one?
- I think they will...
- wait!
I'm not asking you.
Time out.
I'm not asking you.
You don't live here.
Looks like you got a job.
I'm asking Hunt.
He's one of us.
He knows 'em.
What do you think, Hunt?
Hunt!
Hunt!
Hunt!
I think, um...
I think, er... who remembers that high school basketball game at Pittsburgh?
Remember that guard for roosevelt, brickhouse?
He averaged 37 points a game.
And, if you'll recall, I was our best defensive player.
Anyway, the coach puts three other guys on him.
He rotates these other three.
He doesn't put me on.
The last quarter, down five, these guys have all fouled out, and brickhouse has 32 points or something ridiculous.
Now, coach pulls me aside, looks me in the eye and says,
"now's the time.
He's yours, take him."
So I took him.
Remember what he scored in the fourth quarter?
Nothing.
Zip.
Zilch.
Point is, you gotta pick your spot.
Now look, we're very lucky to have the Japanese over here.
We just gotta know how to play 'em.
Let 'em make some shots.
Then we make our move.
The game, boys, is won in the fourth quarter.
- Hey, Hunt!
- Whoa.
Yo.
Come the fourth quarter, can you take these guys like you took brickhouse?
Yeah!
Yeah, I can take 'em.
Let me go in with experienced negotiators.
Hey, Hunt, how ya doing?
You look great, really good.
- Hey, I'm off welfare.
- Don't you know it.
Good morning.
Welcome to your first day with Assan motors.
Welcome.
We must build spirit, we must be a team.
One, with one purpose only, everyone thinking only of company.
We'll begin with morning exercises.
Jumping jack.
- Begin!
- No!
Mr. Stevenson.
We're not having a good beginning.
They're not used to getting up in the morning.
I do not blame you.
Even though you are their leader.
OK.
Sit tight.
- Hunt, take a look at these guys.
- Muchachos.
- I say we do it.
- Bullshit, man.
- Come on.
Why not?
- We never exercise.
This is like the first week in high school.
If you wore jeans you got in trouble.
By october, they didn't care if you wore pants.
Which you didn't sometimes.
One time, ok.
Anyway, do it a couple of days, they'll forget it.
Duck hop.
- Duck hop.
- OK.
Knee twist.
Hey, come on, don't...
- hey!
- I'm sorry, but no music, no cigar.
Just work.
Here, here, here, here!
- Not here, here...
- What's the difference?
I once did 75 bodies in an hour.
You're jerking us all around here.
Hey, Hunt.
Would you get Mr. moto here off my back?
- He refuses to learn proper... pro...
- the guy can't even say it!
They're moving us all around.
Why can't we do what we know?
Every man learns every job, then we are a team.
No man is special.
Ah, yeah, I got the problem.
Come here.
See, here's the deal on that.
You're in america now, and Americans really like to feel special.
- Even him?
- It's go time!
Whoa, wait a minute.
Easy.
- Let's put everybody where they belong.
- He belongs in Japan.
There is one way to run this factory.
One way.
Is that so?
I got your one way.
Relax, would you?
Will you take it easy?
You wanna let go of that now?
Defect-o.
That's the dealer's problem.
Every car can't be perfect.
In Japan, if there is defect, worker is ashamed.
He stays night to fix.
In Japan, goal is zero per cent defect.
How'd you slip by?
- Gooseman, what's the matter?
- He took my paper.
So what?
You'll give it back, right?
Wrong.
He said we can't take papers into the head.
Can he have the paper back?
See, we encourage google to read.
Hunt!
We gotta talk.
Wait, willie, I'm in the middle of something.
- I gave you the afternoon off.
- I cleared it with you, right?
- Will you give me a second?
- We're talking here.
- So, I'm going out and they stop me.
- Who?
The rice-a-ronl patrol.
They say if I leave, it'll count against me.
My kid is getting his tonsils out, he's scared.
- I promised him I'd be there.
- OK.
- You're reading, good.
So, what about it?
- Hold on.
Thanks.
We'll talk about this later.
- No newspaper.
- Yeah, well, ok.
We'll talk about it.
I'll go to the office, talk to number one san.
- A lot of guys have been complaining.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Go see your kid.
American car.
Hey, wild bunch!
- Hey, sugar-puss, what's cooking?
- No cooking, typing.
OK, where's your boss?
Today not a good day to see boss-man.
He between a rock and a hard-on.
No shit.
Whoa, I gotta see this.
- Hi, boss.
- Ah, Mr. Stevenson.
Hey, please, Hunt, ok?
Or the Hunter, if you like.
- Can I help you?
- You probably can.
- How does your family like america?
- I didn't ask.
Speaking of your family - and I really can't wait to meet them any of your kids ever have any surgery?
- What?
You know my friend willie, guy that works downstairs?
His kid's going to have his tonsils out.
Willie'd really like to be there 'cause he's this superdad or something.
- He lives for his kids.
- But work suffers.
Let's talk about work.
I think I can help out.
You know this zero-defect deal?
- No?
- Nah.
Work, work, you'll go nuts.
I had a cousin, mary elizabeth, checked out of reality, never to return.
She worked.
That's gonna happen to you guys.
It's just cars, not brain surgery.
I see what you are saying.
Hey, there we go.
Got that settled.
Good.
A load off my mind.
A few more things and I'll get out of your hair, which looks good, I mean that.
Oh, thank you.
My brother's a barber, and before I left Japan... that's interesting.
Anyway, you know your number two, Saito?
This guy doesn't work and play well with others, if you ask me.
- What is this stuff?
- Seaweed.
Mr. Saito is not a typical Japanese.
I'll tell you something.
I'd dump him.
Really, if it was me, I'd lose him.
Outta there.
He's the nephew of my boss.
Whoa, that could be tough, huh?
Then just get him to lighten up, he's a real pain in the ass.
We have our own way of making cars.
Let the guys do what they do best.
- I see what you are saying.
- Great!
We're cooking.
You know what?
You're a guy I can talk to.
How often?
- You guys don't play softball, do you?
- We play baseball.
I' ve heard of softball.
We need a practice game saturday, wanna come play?
- What time?
- Two.
- If we're not busy.
- OK.
We just play for beer.
- So do we.
- And afterwards, we piss for distance.
For us, it's accuracy.
The Kazmonaut.
Oh, man.
They look like the yankees.
I hate 'em already.
Mr. Stevenson.
Kaz-man.
Here you go, babe.
- You look good.
- Thank you.
We just need to warm up.
- Sure.
Hey, nice glove.
- It's a haseo makasakl model.
- Oh.
I' ve got a merv griffin model here.
- That's good.
What is this crap?
Boys, play ball.
I'm gonna put a stop to this crap.
Here we go.
Let's see a little bunt now.
Come on, whale killer.
Let's see a bunt.
Last inning, Hunt.
Two runs from winning.
Bases loaded, Hunt.
Come on now.
Give it some stick.
Two runs, we win.
All right.
See the ball, Hunt.
- See the ball.
- Hit it on the ground.
Goddamn.
All right!
Two runs scored, we win!
The guy should've faced that.
- You ok?
- Yeah.
It was a good game.
We had fun.
Look, I'm really sorry, man.
He's fine.
All over the base, man.
- Showed him, huh?
- Yeah, you showed him.
- Practise your english.
- Tomorrow is the boy's birthday.
- I bought him a bicycle.
- Fine.
At sears, where america shops.
I cannot put it together.
Here are the instructions.
- Not tonight.
- I want him to see it when he wakes up.
- Kazihiro.
- I'm working!
I have no time.
Why do American fathers have time?
Why?
Because their work sucks.
You leave my mother out of this!
It's your boss, Mr. Sakamoto.
No sir, I did not raise production.
It is down another 3½ per cent this month.
Yes, I'm very sorry, sir.
Hey, look who's back.
Hey, pea-brain, what's going on?
- Tony, where'd they put you?
- Right here.
- On these guns?
- On this spot.
They're gonna reassign you, they told me to tell you.
Hunt, I bet I'm getting your old job.
- Foreman, right?
- Bet that's it.
Hear that, you fartheads?
I'm getting off the line here.
- Mr.
- Hershiser.
Mr. Hershiser!
- Yo.
- We have a new position for you.
Ah, yeah.
That's what I heard.
We are understaffed in the, ah, custodial department.
We are transferring you there.
Your pay will be the same.
Please continue.
Hey, yo, made-In-Japan.
What am I supposed to do with this?
That should be obvious.
We expect you to sweep.
Hey, come here.
He knocks you down, so you make him sweep up?
No.
Not personal.
He has more defects than any other worker in the factory.
It was Kazihiro's decision.
A very good one.
- Oh, yeah?
Defects, is that it?
- Wait.
Hold on.
You're doing a great job.
We're shit on their shoes.
This is just for a while.
Just hang in there.
I'm going to Kazihiro's for dinner this weekend.
- Dinner, sounds great.
- No, no.
I'm gonna lay down the law.
- I'm quitting.
- How can you quit?
I'll kick the Japanese crap out of him.
- Wait, you've got two kids.
- I'm not taking this.
You gotta take it.
Everybody's looking at me.
What am I supposed to do?
You're supposed to take care of your family.
That's what you're supposed to do.
Let 'em look.
It doesn't matter what they think.
Let's go.
Let's go, get back to work.
This is delicious.
- What do you call this?
- Meatloaf.
You could not tell?
Well, you know, I'm thinking to myself,
"this tastes a little bit like meatloaf, but it's too delicious to be meatloaf."
In fact, Audrey leaned over and said to me, "honey, can I have some of yours?"
What, am I gonna say no?
I love her, I'm gonna give it to her.
There you are.
Whoops!
- Thanks.
- Sure.
- Are we ready for dessert?
- Oh, boy, I know I am.
In a few minutes.
Right now, we have some business to discuss.
- Hey, Audrey.
- What?
Why don't you... you know...
leave?
Actually, I'm interested in what's going on at the plant.
Nobody minds if I stay, right?
See.
Mr. Stevenson...
Hunt.
How do you think things are going at the factory?
- Honestly, Kaz?
- Yes, please.
Not too well.
See, you're stateside now.
But you still act like Yokohama mamas.
No offence.
- None taken.
- Can I be frank for a second?
I' ve heard a lot of talk about how good the Japanese businessmen are.
Frankly...
I'm sorry, I don't get it.
I don't see it, I'm not impressed.
Not one iota.
- You're fired.
- What?
You can't fire me!
You'll go back on the line with the others.
Wait a minute.
Explain this to me.
Why?
I do not understand American workers.
They arrive late, they leave early, stay home when they are sick.
They put themselves above company.
You seem to feel the same way.
OK, but explain something to me.
When this was an American factory, production was 10% higher than now.
Ten per cent?
In Japan, production in same size factory is 40% higher.
With superior quality.
- Impossible.
How can you work so fast?
- Japanese worker is very loyal.
He's very proud when company does well.
- He's ashamed when it does poorly.
- Like now.
In Japan, when production lags, worker stays longer in factory.
OK, overtime.
Time-and-a-half is standard.
They do not do it for pay.
They do it for company.
Yeah, but that's there, this is here.
Gentlemen, this is an American factory.
They won't go for that.
Is that how you feel, that they'll never go for it?
There's one guy who can get 'em to go for it, and you're looking at him.
You can change their attitude?
- If I can't, nobody can.
- Nobody can.
Hey, would you shut up?
Goddamn.
OK.
You guys have a problem, right?
I'm the answer man.
I can work this out and make everybody happy, I always have.
Come on, you gotta give me a shot.
All right.
We make no more changes for now.
There you go.
Yeah.
Hey, hon... wanna stop off and get some ice cream?
Haagen-dazs.
Eat shit and die.
- You having your period?
- Stop the car.
How could you do that to me?
Telling me to shut up in front of all those people!
I'm dealing with a delicate situation.
- So, what are you trying to do?
- I'm trying to save jobs.
The only job I heard being threatened was yours.
They picked me for this job.
I didn't ask for it.
They need me.
They need to know where things stand.
They don't need a guy who's trying to do it all by himself.
It'd be pretty nice to have a girlfriend who's supportive of me.
Supportive?
You mean some chick who'll go along with everything you say.
- A parrot with tits.
- How can you bring Heather into this?
I wasn't thinking of Heather.
But apparently you were.
Oh, Audrey, come on.
Come on, Audrey!
- Morning!
- Where did you come from?
I' ve been swimming down below you the whole time.
- Is there anyone else down there?
- There might be.
You know, boys, now I' ve got you all together,
I' ve been thinking it over.
You know what we need?
An incentive programme.
We don't need an incentive programme.
We need faster workers.
We need a fish to bite your pecker off.
What's the most cars you guys ever turned out in one month in Japan?
Fifteen thousand.
All right, my men will make 15,000 cars next month.
But when they do, you give them their old salaries and you guarantee 'em full employment.
We got a deal?
- I'm not sure if...
- What have you got to lose?
All right.
We strike a deal.
Fifteen thousand cars, not any less.
One less than fifteen thousand, no raise, nothing.
I'm starting to like this ritual.
You know, this is really hard for me to say, but I got to tell you something, man.
The American worker is really second best, I'm sorry.
The Japanese can do everything better, faster and longer.
You don't like to hear that, do you?
Neither do I, 'cause it's bullshit.
- Who's better than us?
- Nobody!
- Who?
- Nobody!
You bet your red, white and blue ass.
When they told me no Americans could ever match the amount of cars made by the Japanese in one month it took about a dozen guys to hold my ass down.
I said, "not only will we make more cars than you, when we break your record,
"I expect full employment here."
I'm talking about 200 more of our union brothers and sisters back to work.
And like I told you months ago, at $11.50 an hour.
Hey, Hunt, how many cars for the record?
How many?
How many?
Fifteen thousand cars in one month.
That's 15,000 in a month.
Did you say 15,000?
Are you joking, or what?
No, I'm not kidding.
Come on, we can do that.
Can't we?
Are you saying the Japanese are better than us?
- But 15,000, that's a lot of work.
- What if we come in just under 15,000?
We get nothing for all that work.
What kind of deal is that?
Excuse me, fellas, but the man's not an idiot.
He wouldn't let that happen.
Hey, of course not.
Even if we just come close, we get something, right?
- All right.
- Like half a raise for 13,000?
For 13,000, yeah.
Why didn't you tell us that from the beginning?
'Cause I just thought of it.
'Cause I just thought...
I thought it'd be better to concentrate on the full fifteen and that way get the whole raise.
Let's not even think about 13,000.
Let's not even talk about it.
Let's pretend I just made this crazy thing up about 13,000 cars.
That way, we just go for the full fifteen.
I say we can do it.
Let's do it and do it our way.
- Can we do it?
- Yeah!
- Oh, come on, man.
Can we do it?
- Yeah!
Can we do it?
Yes, yes, yes!
It won't be easy.
We gotta do what the Japanese do.
If they fall behind, they stay after hours.
They work late.
They show up early.
- Hey!
- Morning.
Sometimes the workers ask for the line to be speeded up.
They cut down on lunch hours and breaks.
They save time any way they can.
If they can do it, we can do it.
Tony, do you need two hands to scratch your ass?
Let's work.
- We gotta talk.
- Not now, we'll fall behind.
Two bumpers on a car, not one.
- Hunt, listen.
- What?
We got it.
We're gonna get the raise!
There you go!
I figured it out, 13,000 cars.
All we do is work the rest of the month eight hours a day like always.
13,000?
That's good.
But, see, you can't think like that, 'cause then we don't make the 15,000.
- We ain't gonna make that anyway.
- Then we gotta work harder.
- This is sunday!
- OK.
I haven't seen my kids in two weeks, how can you say that?
- I know, but...
- we're gonna make the 13,000.
We're gonna make the raise and a lot of us are satisfied with that.
Do you believe that guy?
- Excuse me.
- You're excused.
- Hey, buster, what's going on?
- Just doin' some shopping.
- Mr. Stevenson.
- Hi.
Want something from here?
She wants something, but she's not having much luck getting it.
Here you go.
Hey, look...
I know you're drunk and things aren't going well, but why don't you lighten up?
Why don't you just kiss her ass like you do her husband every day?
Mommy, mommy!
Clean up in aisle three.
Sorry, man.
My wife told me what had happened and I am grateful.
Oh, gee.
Hey, do me a favour, don't fire the guy.
He's really been very unhappy lately.
I will not fire him.
You are good friend to him.
Yeah.
You didn't see him sprawled out across the cheese puffs.
Still, you are his friend.
In Japan I have many friends.
We only talk about cars or do exercises.
But sometimes we go see a sumo game.
But that's in Japan.
- Well, once again, thank you very much.
- OK.
Hey, wanna go get a beer?
Right there, what's that?
- I don't know.
- That's two men walking a breast!
I got one for you.
This is a one-eared elephant.
Wait a minute, there's a church league here.
Reverend... one-eared elephant.
Put him back in the zoo.
We're going to jail before the night's over.
- What a laugh we're having, huh?
- Yeah, good raughs.
I guess I' ve got things running pretty well at the factory, right?
Mr. Saito is major fuckhead.
I beg your pardon.
He calls Japan and tells them that I am losing control here.
- One more failure and I am ruined.
- What do you mean, one more?
Remember when you first saw me?
Yeah, at the screaming academy.
You were enrolled there, I think.
The place for failures.
- I am not a good leader.
- You are.
No, I am not.
I used to worry that men were working too hard, missing their families.
I worried that they were not getting personal satisfaction from their work.
You animal.
- You make jokes.
- No, I'm not.
I had to make a shimatsusho for workers.
- You had to cook for those guys?
- No, an apology.
I had to apologise to the workers for letting their production fall behind.
I begged for their forgiveness.
They were all humiliated because of me.
The only measure of a worker's value is the work.
The company is everything.
Team!
That is what has raised us from a conquered nation to an economic power.
- We are one, with one purpose.
- You guys are doing great, I admit it.
He'll be back.
There's a midnight show.
One more failure and I'm ruined.
I got troubles, bud.
You think you have troubles.
I have troubles with hair on 'em.
Listen, I told the guys there might be a partial raise if we made 13,000 cars this month.
- You told them that?
- I know.
You shouldn't drink if you find that funny.
I find it totally depressing.
You're right.
You're right!
I am?
Hey!
- Are you shittin' me?
- No.
You are in more trouble than me.
I feel much better.
It's jammed, goog.
Call maintenance.
- No good, I say two hours.
- Good, I could use a break.
You could?
You've had five months break, you should be pretty rested.
I'm getting very sick of you.
What do you want from us?
We eat, sleep and piss on the line!
- Shut off the line!
- Shut that goddamn line off!
- You ok?
- I tried to unjam it.
I didn't want us to lose time.
Back off, will you, Hunt?
This is your fault to begin with.
- Bad timing, huh?
- Bad for you.
What happened?
Why have they stopped?
One of the workers had an accident.
Why are the others not working?
Back to work.
Back to work!
A man has been hurt.
You may be next.
Excuse me.
This is for Mr. Googleman.
How is he?
- He's fine.
We're going in to see him.
- I'm happy.
That's the main thing, as long as you're happy.
He's happy they only have to give us half the raise.
- Half the raise?
- For making 13,000 cars in a month.
That is not so.
It was 15,000 or no raise.
We just talked to that guy lto.
We found out there's no raise for 13,000 cars.
I'm calling all the guys and we're coming over to get you.
Oh, shit!
Hygiene... get in there, you ungrateful little... get in!
Defects!
- No raise for 13,000 cars.
- You going somewhere?
- No.
- Let's get this over with.
You hear what I said?
There is no raise for 13,000 cars.
All right.
Look, fellas... now, listen...
- here's what happened.
- We know what happened.
They made a deal with you, then they broke it.
Those sons of bitches!
They did make that deal, didn't they?
Yeah, they made a deal with me!
The sons of bitches.
Union meeting, tomorrow.
But first, we're going up to see that...
- What's his name?
- Kazihiro.
...Katzihiro on our lunch hour.
- Come with us, call him a liar.
I'll do better than that, I'll get there before you.
I'll have this settled before you arrive.
That's what separates us from the Japanese.
- We got you looking out for us.
- Hey, fellas, I'm just doing...
- let's go get a couple of brewskis.
- I'm buyin'.
- Hey, I'm sorry...
- No, it was me.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
I got kind of a...
Come for a few beers.
Let's talk about it there.
No, you go ahead, I... come on, come on.
I ought to stay.
I'll talk to you later.
Yeah?
All right.
Don't feed Anabelle.
No more MTV.
No more Twisted Sister.
Read a book!
More Jimmy Dean pure pork sausage?
No!
No more Jimmy Dean, no more Hawaiian punch.
No more green giant frozen niblets.
Who the hell can that be?
Yes?
May we come in?
Yes.
Please... come in.
Sit.
Please sit...
- Can I get you anything?
- No.
GI Joe!
That is neighbour's child.
Everything is all right here?
Yes.
Fine, great!
Well, have a nice trip back.
I will come to the factory tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow is not good day.
- Why not?
Factory is locked and we can't find key.
Bullshit-o!
The men are having a big union meeting tomorrow night.
Is this true?
- Yes.
- This does not make me very happy.
You have let me down.
Come, nephew.
I am tired.
Uncle... you can stay at my place.
- Is your wife with you?
- Yes.
Ramada Inn.
- We gotta talk.
- You're telling me, brother.
My men are expecting a raise, I gotta get 'em one.
- You shouldn't have lied.
- I thought we'd make the quota.
And I figured if we didn't, you'd be man enough to give them something.
We're a thousand lousy cars short.
Impossible.
Tell them not to form a union or Mr. Sakamoto will be displeased.
Good idea.
I should've thought of that.
I'll go down and talk to the guys and say,
"we shouldn't form a union, 'cause that would displease Mr. Sakamoto."
You said you could control your men.
You put me in very bad situation.
I bailed your ass out I don't know how many times.
What do you think kept them going this long?
Your charm?
It was me.
I backed you, I handed you 14,000 cars, and now I'm gonna look like shit.
Give my men a raise!
If I do, Mr. Sakamoto will have a baby.
Working conditions must stay as they are.
Tell them that.
- Now who's nuts?
- Not us.
We know what we're doing.
I see now why they gave me ribbons of shame.
- I was thinking like an American.
- Don't flatter yourself, ace.
It's true.
Everybody here thinks they are special.
Nobody works for the team.
They're too busy getting personalised license plates.
You wouldn't last two days in management training programme.
We wouldn't be stupid enough to stay two days.
Because you are selfish, it's what makes you weak.
I'm weak?
You don't have the guts to stand up to your boss.
You're a real millie, you know that?
I am no millie!
Get out of here!
You're fired!
- You don't work here any more!
- I'm fired?
That's great.
Fine with me.
You think you're so hot.
This factory's running like shit.
It's run our way!
The way we know how!
This is the way!
Oh, yeah?
If you're so great, how come you lost the big one?
- Come on.
- Whoa, break it up, Hunt.
- He's nuts.
- Take it easy.
- We'll work it out at the meeting.
- I don't need any meeting.
I'm through right now.
- Anybody else need a meeting?
- No!
All right, let's walk.
Welcome to the Hadleyville Fourth of July picnic.
Lots of fun for everybody, and don't forget the big fireworks show tonight.
Gotta give it to you, Hunt.
You said you'd handle 'em in the fourth quarter.
They lied to you, but you didn't let 'em get away with it.
That was great.
Top notch, Hunt.
Good evening.
May I have your attention, please?
Is Hunt Stevenson here?
Hunt Stevenson?
Come on up here, son.
The man who saved Hadleyville.
We'll stay out till we get the raise!
Have I got a piece of news for you.
I just got official word from Assan motors.
The factory is closed.
What?
- A lockout?
- No bright boy, not a lockout, a pull-out.
A close-down, an adiós, a "sayonara, round-eyes".
They said the workers, and especially their leadership, were too difficult to deal with.
So they're closing the factory and going back to Japan.
The man who saved Hadleyville.
You're the man who killed Hadleyville, and I'm gonna kill you!
Wait a minute.
Why are you blaming Hunt?
He tried like hell, then they made a deal and weaselled out.
Let me tell you something.
We are behind you, Hunt. 100%.
If you buy that, you all stay here and starve with him.
Fuck you!
Quiet!
Your friend Hunt's trying to speak.
Go ahead, Hunt.
First of all, I think you all should know something.
See...
Gee, I don't know, I figure we made fifteen... you know... if we made 13,000 cars, we'd be so close to 15,000, right?
- That if we...
- Hunt.
- What are you trying to tell us?
- Yeah!
- I lied.
- My god.
Yeah, there was no... there was no deal for 13,000 cars.
We walked out on a lie?
I never in a million years thought it could lead to this, I swear.
- You should've told us the truth.
- The truth?
You don't want the truth.
You want to hear that Americans are better than anybody else.
They're kicking our butts, that ain't luck.
There's your truth.
Sure, the great old American do-or-die spirit.
Yeah, it's alive.
But they've got it.
I tell you, we'd better get it back.
We'd better get it back damn fast.
Instead, we're strutting around telling ourselves how great we are.
I guess if I was really a leader, I would've told you this months ago.
Instead, I was telling you basketball stories.
I put myself in front of the town and I'm really sorry.
I swear to you, man, I'm really sorry.
Ito-san's wife is in labour.
He would like to go.
You want to leave?
No, sir.
I want to stay and work.
This is looney tunes.
Looney tunes?
That's all, folks!
- We are insane!
- Why are you talking American?
Because I have American idea.
We work too damn hard.
This is not our lives.
This is a factory.
Our friends, our families should be our lives.
We are killing ourselves.
We are millies.
Many of you are troubled by the same things as me, huh?
Tell him.
Tell him that we have things we can learn from Americans.
Need any help?
I went by your house.
How come you're still out here?
Couldn't go home.
Somebody filled my car with horse manure.
- Who would do that?
- I don't know.
I don't think it was a horse.
Hunt, I...
I came to tell you you were great tonight.
It took a lot of guts to say what you said, and I was really proud of you.
Do you think I could possibly have a hug?
Oh, god.
Right on this bridge is where I first kissed you.
Yep.
Jesus!
That's Kazihiro.
What's he doing here?
Hey!
You look good.
- Did you join a health club?
- I came out here to be alone.
In Japan, you're never alone.
You put on your pants, there's someone in there.
It's almost that bad here.
Yeah, I need this.
I'm ruined.
I destroyed my career.
You're ruined?
There's 1,200 families in this town that are ruined... you jag-off.
I let down myself, I let down my men.
I wiped out your town.
I can't stand it any more.
Nice talkin' to you.
Jeez!
Hey, are you nuts?
If you're gonna drown yourself, at least take off your watch.
I'm not drowning myself, I'm just freaking out!
Are you guys ok?
Yeah, we're all right.
Kazmania here was trying to swim back to Japan.
OK.
I'll wait for you up here.
- You ok?
- Yes.
Come on.
You're a maniac.
- Last night, I told my boss off.
- Oh, yeah.
Good for you.
Was he awake?
Are you kidding?
I was on him good.
I was on him like hair on a gorilla.
- Where do you get these expressions?
- TV.
You're coming around, Kazmonaut.
Took you long enough.
Yes, we screwed this up good.
Ah, dammit.
You know when you think of all the shit we did wrong, and it's an impressive amount, we were this close to pulling this thing off.
This close to doing it.
Well, look.
I made some big mistakes.
Is it just me, or do you hate the way wet shorts feel?
- I actually kind of like it.
- Really?
What a waste.
- This could've been big.
- That's what kills me.
Yes, I feel like you.
I'd love another chance.
I know we could do better.
Get outta here.
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm going to work.
Hey, hey.
What work?
They shut down.
Why are you with him?
Kaz?
He's going back to work with me.
- Aren't you in enough trouble?
- Where's your uncle?
Ramada Inn coffee shop, eating pancakes.
Tell him we made a deal with these men.
By 7.30 tomorrow, there will be 15,000 cars.
If he's a man of honour, he'll keep his promise and give these men their raises.
Certainly.
I will tell him you said that.
Now!
My wife had baby girl!
Congratulations.
We still got 1,000 cars to build, thought we'd go knock 'em off.
- 1,000 cars.
Two of you.
- We're gonna skip lunch.
This shouldn't be too bad.
Hell, these at the end of the line here are almost done.
- Well, what are they doing?
- They're building a car.
Hey, Hunt.
This whole thing is an insult to my intelligence, man.
- Is that possible?
- Really, I'm serious.
All right, ha, ha.
He thinks if we see him working, we'll rush in and help.
OK.
There's one.
- What'd that take us, twenty minutes?
- Four hours.
Why?
Just tell me, why is he doing it?
He wants to look good for the japs.
He's covering his ass.
- I don't buy that.
- Give me another reason.
I tell you what, maybe he's just trying to save this town.
Hey, Hunt.
We're here.
Yes!
No, no, no.
Not everywhere.
Here, here, here and here.
Got it?
We could use another man on the wipers.
Hunt, Sakamoto-san is here.
How are things going?
- Ito says we're short.
- It's close.
We're going so fast, it's hard to keep count.
But we look short.
OK.
By seven-thirty, he's going to start counting cars.
- While he counts the cars...
- We keep building.
Good idea.
Boys, on the last few, we may have to cut a few corners.
All right?
Just little things like... engines.
Maybe I will not take the trouble to count.
I understand you question my honour.
I did not question it, I counted on it.
Human forklift comin' through.
Get this one down off the jack.
No, one bolt, not four bolts.
Don't count this one.
Pat, don't bolt 'em on, just stick 'em on.
We'll do that tomorrow.
14,994.
That's all.
That's not enough.
Wait a minute.
We still have cars inside.
Why didn't you bring them out?
Good question.
Let's go find out.
He's coming!
Hey!
Where you fellas been?
We've been standing around here for a couple of hours waiting for you cowboys.
There you go!
Well, there they are.
More than enough.
Drinks are on me.
Safety glass.
Ow!
My head!
I'll make a list of everything that is wrong with these cars.
Hey, wait a minute.
Are you leaving?
- Yes.
- Just like that?
You were six cars short.
Oh, ok.
Six cars short.
OK.
I tell you, you're making a big mistake.
Why did you say that?
Why do I say that?
- Let's talk about the Pittsburgh game.
- Oh, my god!
We're down 16 points going into the 4th quarter.
People got up and left.
They missed the greatest comeback in the history of that tournament.
- Do you get my point?
- Not at all.
If you walk out that door, you're going to miss a great comeback.
We're ready to roll here, jack.
This will never be like a Japanese factory, jack.
Oh, yeah?
You're right.
You know what else?
So what?
You failed.
Really?
You know what?
I got one of the first cars ever made here.
The first car.
I don't think I want it any more.
As a matter of fact, here, why don't you take the keys?
I'd rather have one of those cars.
I'd rather have one of these cars we made together by hand.
Your guys and my guys, together.
You know why?
'Cause those cars stand for something.
Those cars stand for something pretty great.
I'm proud of those cars.
I'm taking one.
Gentlemen...
I'm going home in my new car.
I thought it handled great.
Here, uncle, here is everything that is substandard on all these cars.
That's some list!
Good team.
Good men.
You will fix those before they leave the factory.
I will.
I will?
I like you.
You make me laugh.
I don't see anything wrong with these cars.
Are you crazy?
Congrat-lation!
Fifteen thousand cars.
Nephew.
Good luck in your new job.
Let's rock.
- Morning.
- Hiya.
- You look great.
- Thanks.
- Are you ready?
- Hey, I was born ready.
- Who knows that better than you?
- I hope no one.
You know, the amazing thing is, I' m not even nervous.
You just put your garbage in my car.
Hey, hunt.
Today is the big day.
Give 'em hell, boy.
- I' ll give it to 'em.
- We're counting on you.
Mrs barnyak, this face is on the case.
- God bless.
- Thank you.
If I screw this up, this town is dead meat.
- But you're not nervous.
- No.
I' m not.
Oh, god.
You are all weak.
That is why you have been sent here.
Your bosses find you lazy and without confidence.
Hold on, hunt, my man.
On his way to japan!
- Hey, hunt!
- Next stop japan, buddy.
Take a taxi.
You look real good.
I' m glad they sent you, not some city council gumhead.
Yeah.
And, hunt, don't eat any raw shit, ok?
- Wish me luck.
- Go get 'em.
I need assan motors.
Assan motors.
Like I' m driving.
So I get on the train, and here I am.
Guy says to me, "get on the bullet train." So, I get on the bullet train I'm in a rice-field.
...the guy said, "go that way." Then the other guy said, "go that way."
Now I don't know.
Should I go that way?
Thank you very much for everything.
I have learned a lot.
I was a bad executive.
I' ll be a good one.
I have three children and a wife to support.
Please, let me pass.
You are not ready.
You will stay two more weeks.
Excuse me.
Yo, whoa, baby.
Jeez.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.
I' m looking for assan motors.
Anybody know where that is?
I' m really lost.
I don't have a clue where I am.
Am I still in japan?
- You must want executive building.
- Right.
You are in the wrong place.
Ok, where's the right place?
One block over.
Ooh, guess who got out of the wrong side of the bed this morning?
- Nice ribbons.
- Those are ribbons of shame!
I' d wear 'em on the inside if I was you.
Thanks a lot.
Excuse me, you got spit right here.
On the corner of your mouth.
Get the other... it's on the other... thanks a lot.
Hiya, fellas.
Or, as you say hunt stevenson, right here... ok.
Hey, where do I put the screen?
I got a screen here.
Whoa!
Let me just set this down over here.
Don't really need it, after I lugged it about 14,000 miles.
Don't worry about it.
I am crazy for your country.
I mean, I love it.
My dad was here with the army, I guess it was 1940... did you decorate this place yourselves?
'Cause it's damn nice.
It's... real oriental kind of a feel to it.
- Do you speak english?
I' m just curious.
- We all speak english.
Continue, please.
We may as well get started, I know you guys have a long day of... staring ahead of you.
Where are the lights?
Jesus.
Ok, here we go.
This is hadleyville.
There's the factory.
It's been there 35 years.
It's been closed down the past nine months, but two years ago, it was completely retooled.
I tell you, it is in great shape.
Whoa, how did that get in there?
Yikes!
Whoops!
That's hazel lockwash.
Hazel's unit was responsible for putting out over a hundred thousand car engines in one year.
And I think the key word here is "put out".
Putting out.
Ok.
This is... that's... can you turn the lights on?
Look, here's the deal.
Two years ago, the underwear factory closed down in hadleyville.
This was a bummer because you could get underwear there really cheap, good underwear, too, not the kind where the elastic comes out and rubs your butt.
That leaves the auto factory.
The auto factory, then, employed everybody in town.
Everybody owed their living, in some way, to that factory.
These people worked really hard.
Then the factory closed.
If you come and open up that factory, these people will work harder for you.
I tell you, this is a great town, these are great people, and I' m willing to do anything I have to do to get that town back on its feet.
That's my story.
I' m sure you have a lot of questions.
So, go crazy.
I know you don't want to be first 'cause everybody laughs at you.
Don't worry.
Come on.
Ok.
There he is!
Hi, daddy!
Audrey!
I went by your house every day and fed your fish, and... here's all your mail.
Oh, my god.
Baby, please, I' m trying to drive.
- I missed you.
- Yeah, I can tell.
No, I mean, I really missed you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
That's nice.
- Hey, the pizza shop's closed.
- Yeah, yesterday.
And next week the barbershop, the record store.
The only one doing well is the guy who rents u-hauls.
A lot of people are moving.
You haven't said anything about the japanese.
How did it go?
Remember the first time I met your dad?
He came after me with a power sander?
- Yeah.
- It didn't go quite that well.
They should've sent somebody else.
Mr douglas?
Hunt stevenson.
I used to work for you, remember?
I understand you're plant manager up there now.
Congratulations.
I really liked working for you when you were here.
Yeah.
Hey, how's mrs douglas doing?
So, you never hear from her, then?
Oh... termite man, huh?
Yeah.
Well, I' ll tell you the reason I' m calling.
I' m toying with the idea of relocating.
And I was... yeah, so...
I' d go through the local union up there, huh?
Ok.
Hey, how's that dog of yours, rusty?
That frisky little... steam-rollered, huh?
Hunt stevenson, yeah.
No, stevenson.
Yeah, you know me.
We were at the kindergarten together.
No, not you and me, me and your cousin hector.
He used to talk about you all the time at nap time.
That's right.
Listen, ed, here's why I' m calling.
I' m the foreman up here in hadleyville.
I understand you're doing some hiring down in the galveston plant.
Hey, I can jump in a car right now and be down there in 29 hours.
Come on, hunt, forget about it.
You did the best you could.
You did.
Check this out.
Guys, look at this.
Look who's coming.
Heather distefano!
- Who's that guy?
- What?
You like him?
No, I don't like him!
- Hi, boys.
- Hello, heather.
- Hi, hunt.
- Hi, heather.
- God, hunt, she says hello to you?
- She always says hi to me.
She likes me.
In high school, I kept her picture in my locker.
I kept one in my pants, pal.
We've rearranged the produce.
Now, when people are broke, they don't buy meat.
Crackers here, cookies down here.
- Where the kids can see them.
- Gotcha.
Hunt!
Sweetie, you know I enjoy your company, but do you really think it's a good idea to follow me around all day?
Can we talk about this over by the milk?
Hunt, come here!
This is great, I can't believe it.
Come here!
- My eggs.
- Your eggs?
- You ok?
- Yeah.
Great news!
You did it!
I did?
Great!
What'd I do?
- They're coming, next week.
- Who?
Boys!
Do you want me to get the fire hose?
Now, line up and get ready to bow.
Welcome.
Greetings from hadleyville.
I' m the mayor, conrad zwart.
Sorry.
That always happens when I say my name too fast.
Right up here, please.
Thank you for this surprising greeting.
We have many plans.
I' m sorry, I' m not good a speaker as man you sent us.
- Where is mr stevenson?
- Right over there.
Mr stevenson's presentation is a big reason why we are here.
Anybody home?
- Ah, mr stevenson.
What a pleasure.
- How ya doin'?
The door was open, you said two o'clock.
My name is takahara kazihiro, corporate managing director.
Thank you.
Anybody have any subaru or suzukis?
No, ok, go fish.
Now I got it.
I' m trying to remember how I know this guy.
Now I know:
Tokyo.
Right?
I saw you in tokyo.
You were screaming and foaming at the mouth.
Yes, I remember.
What was the deal?
You guys were going crazy.
- Management training programme.
- For executives who are failing.
- Mr stevenson.
- Yeah.
We would like to offer you a new position.
We would like for you to be employee liaison.
Are you shittin' me?
That's great!
This is outline of our company's labour policy.
You're to introduce it to your fellow workers.
Why can't we just run the plant the way we did before?
We did pretty good.
- If you did pretty good, why...?
- Present our ideas.
Do not be influenced by the fact that we are giving you an executive position with a very big raise in pay.
No... why would i?
Don't... no, I won't be influenced by that.
This is great.
- Assuming the factory does open.
- Right.
Well, I already assumed that.
We did not.
Can we count on you?
Fellas is a frog's ass watertight?
Yes, we believe it is.
Work!
Work!
Work!
I know.
I know you want to work.
But, please, let's go over the terms of employment.
May I have your attention, please?
Would you please sit down?
Everyone, sit down.
My name is crandall.
The union sent me 'cause we're concerned about you.
When you walk in without a contract, you are no longer a union.
That's a whole new set of ground rules.
The starting salary is only $8.75 per hour.
- We've been gettin' $11.50!
- We've been gettin' nothing!
- I wanna work!
- All right, work with a contract.
Think they'll give us one?
- I think they will...
- wait!
I' m not asking you.
Time out.
I' m not asking you.
You don't live here.
Looks like you got a job.
I' m asking hunt.
He's one of us.
He knows 'em.
What do you think, hunt?
Hunt!
Hunt!
Hunt!
I think, um...
I think, er... who remembers that high school basketball game at pittsburgh?
Remember that guard for roosevelt, brickhouse?
He averaged 37 points a game.
And, if you'll recall, I was our best defensive player.
Anyway, the coach puts three other guys on him.
He rotates these other three.
He doesn't put me on.
The last quarter, down five, these guys have all fouled out, and brickhouse has 32 points or something ridiculous.
Now, coach pulls me aside, looks me in the eye and says,
"now's the time.
He's yours, take him."
So I took him.
Remember what he scored in the fourth quarter?
Nothing.
Zip.
Zilch.
Point is, you gotta pick your spot.
Now look, we're very lucky to have the japanese over here.
We just gotta know how to play 'em.
Let 'em make some shots.
Then we make our move.
The game, boys, is won in the fourth quarter.
- Hey, hunt!
- Whoa.
Yo.
Come the fourth quarter, can you take these guys like you took brickhouse?
Yeah!
Yeah, I can take 'em.
Let me go in with experienced negotiators.
Hey, hunt, how ya doing?
You look great, really good.
- Hey, I' m off welfare.
- Don't you know it.
Good morning.
Welcome to your first day with assan motors.
Welcome.
We must build spirit, we must be a team.
One, with one purpose only, everyone thinking only of company.
We'll begin with morning exercises.
Jumping jack.
- Begin!
- No!
Mr stevenson.
We're not having a good beginning.
They're not used to getting up in the morning.
I do not blame you.
Even though you are their leader.
Ok.
Sit tight.
- Hunt, take a look at these guys.
- Muchachos.
- I say we do it.
- Bullshit, man.
- Come on.
Why not?
- We never exercise.
This is like the first week in high school.
If you wore jeans you got in trouble.
By october, they didn't care if you wore pants.
Which you didn't sometimes.
One time, ok.
Anyway, do it a couple of days, they'll forget it.
Duck hop.
- Duck hop.
- Ok.
Knee twist.
Hey, come on, don't...
- hey!
- I' m sorry, but no music, no cigar.
Just work.
Here, here, here, here!
- Not here, here...
- what's the difference?
I once did 75 bodies in an hour.
You're jerking us all around here.
Hey, hunt.
Would you get mr moto here off my back?
- He refuses to learn proper... pro...
- the guy can't even say it!
They're moving us all around.
Why can't we do what we know?
Every man learns every job, then we are a team.
No man is special.
Ah, yeah, I got the problem.
Come here.
See, here's the deal on that.
You're in america now, and americans really like to feel special.
- Even him?
- It's go time!
Whoa, wait a minute.
Easy.
- Let's put everybody where they belong.
- He belongs in japan.
There is one way to run this factory.
One way.
Is that so?
I got your one way.
Relax, would you?
Will you take it easy?
You wanna let go of that now?
Defect-o.
That's the dealer's problem.
Every car can't be perfect.
In japan, if there is defect, worker is ashamed.
He stays night to fix.
In japan, goal is zero per cent defect.
How'd you slip by?
- Gooseman, what's the matter?
- He took my paper.
So what?
You'll give it back, right?
Wrong.
He said we can't take papers into the head.
Can he have the paper back?
See, we encourage google to read.
Hunt!
We gotta talk.
Wait, willie, I' m in the middle of something.
- I gave you the afternoon off.
- I cleared it with you, right?
- Will you give me a second?
- We're talking here.
- So, I' m going out and they stop me.
- Who?
The rice-a-ronI patrol.
They say if I leave, it'll count against me.
My kid is getting his tonsils out, he's scared.
- I promised him I' d be there.
- Ok.
- You're reading, good.
So, what about it?
- Hold on.
Thanks.
We'll talk about this later.
- No newspaper.
- Yeah, well, ok.
We'll talk about it.
I' ll go to the office, talk to number one san.
- A lot of guys have been complaining.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Go see your kid.
American car.
Hey, wild bunch!
- Hey, sugar-puss, what's cooking?
- No cooking, typing.
Ok, where's your boss?
Today not a good day to see boss-man.
He between a rock and a hard-on.
No shit.
Whoa, I gotta see this.
- Hi, boss.
- Ah, mr stevenson.
Hey, please, hunt, ok?
Or the hunter, if you like.
- Can I help you?
- You probably can.
- How does your family like america?
- I didn't ask.
Speaking of your family - and I really can't wait to meet them any of your kids ever have any surgery?
- What?
You know my friend willie, guy that works downstairs?
His kid's going to have his tonsils out.
Willie'd really like to be there 'cause he's this superdad or something.
- He lives for his kids.
- But work suffers.
Let's talk about work.
I think I can help out.
You know this zero-defect deal?
- No?
- Nah.
Work, work, you'll go nuts.
I had a cousin, mary elizabeth, checked out of reality, never to return.
She worked.
That's gonna happen to you guys.
It's just cars, not brain surgery.
I see what you are saying.
Hey, there we go.
Got that settled.
Good.
A load off my mind.
A few more things and I' ll get out of your hair, which looks good, I mean that.
Oh, thank you.
My brother's a barber, and before I left japan... that's interesting.
Anyway, you know your number two, saito?
This guy doesn't work and play well with others, if you ask me.
- What is this stuff?
- Seaweed.
Mr saito is not a typical japanese.
I' ll tell you something.
I' d dump him.
Really, if it was me, I' d lose him.
Outta there.
He's the nephew of my boss.
Whoa, that could be tough, huh?
Then just get him to lighten up, he's a real pain in the ass.
We have our own way of making cars.
Let the guys do what they do best.
- I see what you are saying.
- Great!
We're cooking.
You know what?
You're a guy I can talk to.
How often?
- You guys don't play softball, do you?
- We play baseball.
I' ve heard of softball.
We need a practice game saturday, wanna come play?
- What time?
- Two.
- If we're not busy.
- Ok.
We just play for beer.
- So do we.
- And afterwards, we piss for distance.
For us, it's accuracy.
The kazmonaut.
Oh, man.
They look like the yankees.
I hate 'em already.
Mr stevenson.
Kaz-man.
Here you go, babe.
- You look good.
- Thank you.
We just need to warm up.
- Sure.
Hey, nice glove.
- It's a haseo makasakI model.
- Oh.
I' ve got a merv griffin model here.
- That's good.
What is this crap?
Boys, play ball.
I' m gonna put a stop to this crap.
Here we go.
Let's see a little bunt now.
Come on, whale killer.
Let's see a bunt.
Last inning, hunt.
Two runs from winning.
Bases loaded, hunt.
Come on now.
Give it some stick.
Two runs, we win.
All right.
See the ball, hunt.
- See the ball.
- Hit it on the ground.
Goddamn.
All right!
Two runs scored, we win!
The guy should've faced that.
- You ok?
- Yeah.
It was a good game.
We had fun.
Look, I' m really sorry, man.
He's fine.
All over the base, man.
- Showed him, huh?
- Yeah, you showed him.
- Practise your english.
- Tomorrow is the boy's birthday.
- I bought him a bicycle.
- Fine.
At sears, where america shops.
I cannot put it together.
Here are the instructions.
- Not tonight.
- I want him to see it when he wakes up.
- Kazihiro.
- I' m working!
I have no time.
Why do american fathers have time?
Why?
Because their work sucks.
You leave my mother out of this!
It's your boss, mr sakamoto.
No sir, I did not raise production.
It is down another 3½ per cent this month.
Yes, I' m very sorry, sir.
Hey, look who's back.
Hey, pea-brain, what's going on?
- Tony, where'd they put you?
- Right here.
- On these guns?
- On this spot.
They're gonna reassign you, they told me to tell you.
Hunt, I bet I' m getting your old job.
- Foreman, right?
- Bet that's it.
Hear that, you fartheads?
I' m getting off the line here.
- Mr...
- hershiser.
Mr hershiser!
- Yo.
- We have a new position for you.
Ah, yeah.
That's what I heard.
We are understaffed in the, ah, custodial department.
We are transferring you there.
Your pay will be the same.
Please continue.
Hey, yo, made-ln-japan.
What am I supposed to do with this?
That should be obvious.
We expect you to sweep.
Hey, come here.
He knocks you down, so you make him sweep up?
No.
Not personal.
He has more defects than any other worker in the factory.
It was kazihiro's decision.
A very good one.
- Oh, yeah?
Defects, is that it?
- Wait.
Hold on.
You're doing a great job.
We're shit on their shoes.
This is just for a while.
Just hang in there.
I' m going to kazihiro's for dinner this weekend.
- Dinner, sounds great.
- No, no.
I' m gonna lay down the law.
- I' m quitting.
- How can you quit?
I' ll kick the japanese crap out of him.
- Wait, you've got two kids.
- I' m not taking this.
You gotta take it.
Everybody's looking at me.
What am I supposed to do?
You're supposed to take care of your family.
That's what you're supposed to do.
Let 'em look.
It doesn't matter what they think.
Let's go.
Let's go, get back to work.
This is delicious.
- What do you call this?
- Meatloaf.
You could not tell?
Well, you know, I' m thinking to myself,
"this tastes a little bit like meatloaf, but it's too delicious to be meatloaf."
In fact, audrey leaned over and said to me, "honey, can I have some of yours?"
What, am I gonna say no?
I love her, I' m gonna give it to her.
There you are.
Whoops!
- Thanks.
- Sure.
- Are we ready for dessert?
- Oh, boy, I know I am.
In a few minutes.
Right now, we have some business to discuss.
- Hey, audrey.
- What?
Why don't you... you know...
leave?
Actually, I' m interested in what's going on at the plant.
Nobody minds if I stay, right?
See.
Mr stevenson... hunt.
How do you think things are going at the factory?
- Honestly, kaz?
- Yes, please.
Not too well.
See, you're stateside now.
But you still act like yokohama mamas.
No offence.
- None taken.
- Can I be frank for a second?
I' ve heard a lot of talk about how good the japanese businessmen are.
Frankly...
I' m sorry, I don't get it.
I don't see it, I' m not impressed.
Not one iota.
- You're fired.
- What?
You can't fire me!
You'll go back on the line with the others.
Wait a minute.
Explain this to me.
Why?
I do not understand american workers.
They arrive late, they leave early, stay home when they are sick.
They put themselves above company.
You seem to feel the same way.
Ok, but explain something to me.
When this was an american factory, production was 10% higher than now.
Ten per cent?
In japan, production in same size factory is 40% higher.
With superior quality.
- Impossible.
How can you work so fast?
- Japanese worker is very loyal.
He's very proud when company does well.
- He's ashamed when it does poorly.
- Like now.
In japan, when production lags, worker stays longer in factory.
Ok, overtime.
Time-and-a-half is standard.
They do not do it for pay.
They do it for company.
Yeah, but that's there, this is here.
Gentlemen, this is an american factory.
They won't go for that.
Is that how you feel, that they'll never go for it?
There's one guy who can get 'em to go for it, and you're looking at him.
You can change their attitude?
- If I can't, nobody can.
- Nobody can.
Hey, would you shut up?
Goddamn.
Ok.
You guys have a problem, right?
I' m the answer man.
I can work this out and make everybody happy, I always have.
Come on, you gotta give me a shot.
All right.
We make no more changes for now.
There you go.
Yeah.
Hey, hon... wanna stop off and get some ice cream?
Haagen-dazs.
Eat shit and die.
- You having your period?
- Stop the car.
How could you do that to me?
Telling me to shut up in front of all those people!
I' m dealing with a delicate situation.
- So, what are you trying to do?
- I' m trying to save jobs.
The only job I heard being threatened was yours.
They picked me for this job.
I didn't ask for it.
They need me.
They need to know where things stand.
They don't need a guy who's trying to do it all by himself.
It'd be pretty nice to have a girlfriend who's supportive of me.
Supportive?
You mean some chick who'll go along with everything you say.
- A parrot with tits.
- How can you bring heather into this?
I wasn't thinking of heather.
But apparently you were.
Oh, audrey, come on.
Come on, audrey!
- Morning!
- Where did you come from?
I' ve been swimming down below you the whole time.
- Is there anyone else down there?
- There might be.
You know, boys, now I' ve got you all together,
I' ve been thinking it over.
You know what we need?
An incentive programme.
We don't need an incentive programme.
We need faster workers.
We need a fish to bite your pecker off.
What's the most cars you guys ever turned out in one month in japan?
Fifteen thousand.
All right, my men will make 15,000 cars next month.
But when they do, you give them their old salaries and you guarantee 'em full employment.
We got a deal?
- I' m not sure if...
- what have you got to lose?
All right.
We strike a deal.
Fifteen thousand cars, not any less.
One less than fifteen thousand, no raise, nothing.
I' m starting to like this ritual.
You know, this is really hard for me to say, but I got to tell you something, man.
The american worker is really second best, I' m sorry.
The japanese can do everything better, faster and longer.
You don't like to hear that, do you?
Neither do i, 'cause it's bullshit.
- Who's better than us?
- Nobody!
- Who?
- Nobody!
You bet your red, white and blue ass.
When they told me no americans could ever match the amount of cars made by the japanese in one month it took about a dozen guys to hold my ass down.
I said, "not only will we make more cars than you, when we break your record,
"I expect full employment here."
I' m talking about 200 more of our union brothers and sisters back to work.
And like I told you months ago, at $11.50 an hour.
Hey, hunt, how many cars for the record?
How many?
How many?
Fifteen thousand cars in one month.
That's 15,000 in a month.
Did you say 15,000?
Are you joking, or what?
No, I' m not kidding.
Come on, we can do that.
Can't we?
Are you saying the japanese are better than us?
- But 15,000, that's a lot of work.
- What if we come in just under 15,000?
We get nothing for all that work.
What kind of deal is that?
Excuse me, fellas, but the man's not an idiot.
He wouldn't let that happen.
Hey, of course not.
Even if we just come close, we get something, right?
- All right.
- Like half a raise for 13,000?
For 13,000, yeah.
Why didn't you tell us that from the beginning?
'Cause I just thought of it.
'Cause I just thought...
I thought it'd be better to concentrate on the full fifteen and that way get the whole raise.
Let's not even think about 13,000.
Let's not even talk about it.
Let's pretend I just made this crazy thing up about 13,000 cars.
That way, we just go for the full fifteen.
I say we can do it.
Let's do it and do it our way.
- Can we do it?
- Yeah!
- Oh, come on, man.
Can we do it?
- Yeah!
Can we do it?
Yes, yes, yes!
It won't be easy.
We gotta do what the japanese do.
If they fall behind, they stay after hours.
They work late.
They show up early.
- Hey!
- Morning.
Sometimes the workers ask for the line to be speeded up.
They cut down on lunch hours and breaks.
They save time any way they can.
If they can do it, we can do it.
Tony, do you need two hands to scratch your ass?
Let's work.
- We gotta talk.
- Not now, we'll fall behind.
Two bumpers on a car, not one.
- Hunt, listen.
- What?
We got it.
We're gonna get the raise!
There you go!
I figured it out, 13,000 cars.
All we do is work the rest of the month eight hours a day like always.
13,000?
That's good.
But, see, you can't think like that, 'cause then we don't make the 15,000.
- We ain't gonna make that anyway.
- Then we gotta work harder.
- This is sunday!
- Ok.
I haven't seen my kids in two weeks, how can you say that?
- I know, but...
- we're gonna make the 13,000.
We're gonna make the raise and a lot of us are satisfied with that.
Do you believe that guy?
- Excuse me.
- You're excused.
- Hey, buster, what's going on?
- Just doin' some shopping.
- Mr stevenson.
- Hi.
Want something from here?
She wants something, but she's not having much luck getting it.
Here you go.
Hey, look...
I know you're drunk and things aren't going well, but why don't you lighten up?
Why don't you just kiss her ass like you do her husband every day?
Mommy, mommy!
Clean up in aisle three.
Sorry, man.
My wife told me what had happened and I am grateful.
Oh, gee.
Hey, do me a favour, don't fire the guy.
He's really been very unhappy lately.
I will not fire him.
You are good friend to him.
Yeah.
You didn't see him sprawled out across the cheese puffs.
Still, you are his friend.
In japan I have many friends.
We only talk about cars or do exercises.
But sometimes we go see a sumo game.
But that's in japan.
- Well, once again, thank you very much.
- Ok.
Hey, wanna go get a beer?
Right there, what's that?
- I don't know.
- That's two men walking a breast!
I got one for you.
This is a one-eared elephant.
Wait a minute, there's a church league here.
Reverend... one-eared elephant.
Put him back in the zoo.
We're going to jail before the night's over.
- What a laugh we're having, huh?
- Yeah, good raughs.
I guess I' ve got things running pretty well at the factory, right?
Mr saito is major fuckhead.
I beg your pardon.
He calls japan and tells them that I am losing control here.
- One more failure and I am ruined.
- What do you mean, one more?
Remember when you first saw me?
Yeah, at the screaming academy.
You were enrolled there, I think.
The place for failures.
- I am not a good leader.
- You are.
No, I am not.
I used to worry that men were working too hard, missing their families.
I worried that they were not getting personal satisfaction from their work.
You animal.
- You make jokes.
- No, I' m not.
I had to make a shimatsusho for workers.
- You had to cook for those guys?
- No, an apology.
I had to apologise to the workers for letting their production fall behind.
I begged for their forgiveness.
They were all humiliated because of me.
The only measure of a worker's value is the work.
The company is everything.
Team!
That is what has raised us from a conquered nation to an economic power.
- We are one, with one purpose.
- You guys are doing great, I admit it.
He'll be back.
There's a midnight show.
One more failure and I' m ruined.
I got troubles, bud.
You think you have troubles.
I have troubles with hair on 'em.
Listen, I told the guys there might be a partial raise if we made 13,000 cars this month.
- You told them that?
- I know.
You shouldn't drink if you find that funny.
I find it totally depressing.
You're right.
You're right!
I am?
Hey!
- Are you shittin' me?
- No.
You are in more trouble than me.
I feel much better.
It's jammed, goog.
Call maintenance.
- No good, I say two hours.
- Good, I could use a break.
You could?
You've had five months break, you should be pretty rested.
I' m getting very sick of you.
What do you want from us?
We eat, sleep and piss on the line!
- Shut off the line!
- Shut that goddamn line off!
- You ok?
- I tried to unjam it.
I didn't want us to lose time.
Back off, will you, hunt?
This is your fault to begin with.
- Bad timing, huh?
- Bad for you.
What happened?
Why have they stopped?
One of the workers had an accident.
Why are the others not working?
Back to work.
Back to work!
A man has been hurt.
You may be next.
Excuse me.
This is for mr googleman.
How is he?
- He's fine.
We're going in to see him.
- I' m happy.
That's the main thing, as long as you're happy.
He's happy they only have to give us half the raise.
- Half the raise?
- For making 13,000 cars in a month.
That is not so.
It was 15,000 or no raise.
We just talked to that guy lto.
We found out there's no raise for 13,000 cars.
I' m calling all the guys and we're coming over to get you.
Oh, shit!
Hygiene... get in there, you ungrateful little... get in!
Defects!
- No raise for 13,000 cars.
- You going somewhere?
- No.
- Let's get this over with.
You hear what I said?
There is no raise for 13,000 cars.
All right.
Look, fellas... now, listen...
- here's what happened.
- We know what happened.
They made a deal with you, then they broke it.
Those sons of bitches!
They did make that deal, didn't they?
Yeah, they made a deal with me!
The sons of bitches.
Union meeting, tomorrow.
But first, we're going up to see that...
- what's his name?
- Kazihiro.
...katzihiro on our lunch hour.
- Come with us, call him a liar.
I' ll do better than that, I' ll get there before you.
I' ll have this settled before you arrive.
That's what separates us from the japanese.
- We got you looking out for us.
- Hey, fellas, I' m just doing...
- let's go get a couple of brewskis.
- I' m buying'.
- Hey, I' m sorry...
- no, it was me.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
I got kind of a... come for a few beers.
Let's talk about it there.
No, you go ahead, i... come on, come on.
I ought to stay.
I' ll talk to you later.
Yeah?
All right.
Don't feed anabelle.
No more mtv.
No more twisted sister.
Read a book!
More jimmy dean pure pork sausage?
No!
No more jimmy dean, no more hawaiian punch.
No more green giant frozen niblets.
Who the hell can that be?
Yes?
May we come in?
Yes.
Please... come in.
Sit.
Please sit...
- can I get you anything?
- No.
GI joe!
That is neighbour's child.
Everything is all right here?
Yes.
Fine, great!
Well, have a nice trip back.
I will come to the factory tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow is not good day.
- Why not?
Factory is locked and we can't find key.
Bullshit-o!
The men are having a big union meeting tomorrow night.
Is this true?
- Yes.
- This does not make me very happy.
You have let me down.
Come, nephew.
I am tired.
Uncle... you can stay at my place.
- Is your wife with you?
- Yes.
Ramada inn.
- We gotta talk.
- You're telling me, brother.
My men are expecting a raise, I gotta get 'em one.
- You shouldn't have lied.
- I thought we'd make the quota.
And I figured if we didn't, you'd be man enough to give them something.
We're a thousand lousy cars short.
Impossible.
Tell them not to form a union or mr sakamoto will be displeased.
Good idea.
I should've thought of that.
I' ll go down and talk to the guys and say,
"we shouldn't form a union, 'cause that would displease mr sakamoto."
You said you could control your men.
You put me in very bad situation.
I bailed your ass out I don't know how many times.
What do you think kept them going this long?
Your charm?
It was me.
I backed you, I handed you 14,000 cars, and now I' m gonna look like shit.
Give my men a raise!
If I do, mr sakamoto will have a baby.
Working conditions must stay as they are.
Tell them that.
- Now who's nuts?
- Not us.
We know what we're doing.
I see now why they gave me ribbons of shame.
- I was thinking like an american.
- Don't flatter yourself, ace.
It's true.
Everybody here thinks they are special.
Nobody works for the team.
They're too busy getting personalised licence plates.
You wouldn't last two days in management training programme.
We wouldn't be stupid enough to stay two days.
Because you are selfish, it's what makes you weak.
I' m weak?
You don't have the guts to stand up to your boss.
You're a real millie, you know that?
I am no millie!
Get out of here!
You're fired!
- You don't work here any more!
- I' m fired?
That's great.
Fine with me.
You think you're so hot.
This factory's running like shit.
It's run our way!
The way we know how!
This is the way!
Oh, yeah?
If you're so great, how come you lost the big one?
- Come on.
- Whoa, break it up, hunt.
- He's nuts.
- Take it easy.
- We'll work it out at the meeting.
- I don't need any meeting.
I' m through right now.
- Anybody else need a meeting?
- No!
All right, let's walk.
Welcome to the hadleyville fourth of july picnic.
Lots of fun for everybody, and don't forget the big fireworks show tonight.
Gotta give it to you, hunt.
You said you'd handle 'em in the fourth quarter.
They lied to you, but you didn't let 'em get away with it.
That was great.
Top notch, hunt.
Good evening.
May I have your attention, please?
Is hunt stevenson here?
Hunt stevenson?
Come on up here, son.
The man who saved hadleyville.
We'll stay out till we get the raise!
Have I got a piece of news for you.
I just got official word from assan motors.
The factory is closed.
What?
- A lockout?
- No bright boy, not a lockout, a pull-out.
A close-down, an adiós, a "sayonara, round-eyes".
They said the workers, and especially their leadership, were too difficult to deal with.
So they're closing the factory and going back to japan.
The man who saved hadleyville.
You're the man who killed hadleyville, and I' m gonna kill you!
Wait a minute.
Why are you blaming hunt?
He tried like hell, then they made a deal and weaselled out.
Let me tell you something.
We are behind you, hunt. 100%.
If you buy that, you all stay here and starve with him.
Fuck you!
Quiet!
Your friend hunt's trying to speak.
Go ahead, hunt.
First of all, I think you all should know something.
See... gee, I don't know, I figure we made fifteen... you know... if we made 13,000 cars, we'd be so close to 15,000, right?
- That if we...
- hunt.
- What are you trying to tell us?
- Yeah!
- I lied.
- My god.
Yeah, there was no... there was no deal for 13,000 cars.
We walked out on a lie?
I never in a million years thought it could lead to this, I swear.
- You should've told us the truth.
- The truth?
You don't want the truth.
You want to hear that americans are better than anybody else.
They're kicking our butts, that ain't luck.
There's your truth.
Sure, the great old american do-or-die spirit.
Yeah, it's alive.
But they've got it.
I tell you, we'd better get it back.
We'd better get it back damn fast.
Instead, we're strutting around telling ourselves how great we are.
I guess if I was really a leader, I would've told you this months ago.
Instead, I was telling you basketball stories.
I put myself in front of the town and I' m really sorry.
I swear to you, man, I' m really sorry.
Ito-san's wife is in labour.
He would like to go.
You want to leave?
No, sir.
I want to stay and work.
This is looney tunes.
Looney tunes?
That's all, folks!
- We are insane!
- Why are you talking american?
Because I have american idea.
We work too damn hard.
This is not our lives.
This is a factory.
Our friends, our families should be our lives.
We are killing ourselves.
We are millies.
Many of you are troubled by the same things as me, huh?
Tell him.
Tell him that we have things we can learn from americans.
Need any help?
I went by your house.
How come you're still out here?
Couldn't go home.
Somebody filled my car with horse manure.
- Who would do that?
- I don't know.
I don't think it was a horse.
Hunt, i...
I came to tell you you were great tonight.
It took a lot of guts to say what you said, and I was really proud of you.
Do you think I could possibly have a hug?
Oh, god.
Right on this bridge is where I first kissed you.
Yep.
Jesus!
That's kazihiro.
What's he doing here?
Hey!
You look good.
- Did you join a health club?
- I came out here to be alone.
In japan, you're never alone.
You put on your pants, there's someone in there.
It's almost that bad here.
Yeah, I need this.
I' m ruined.
I destroyed my career.
You're ruined?
There's 1,200 families in this town that are ruined... you jag-off.
I let down myself, I let down my men.
I wiped out your town.
I can't stand it any more.
Nice talkin' to you.
Jeez!
Hey, are you nuts?
If you're gonna drown yourself, at least take off your watch.
I' m not drowning myself, I' m just freaking out!
Are you guys ok?
Yeah, we're all right.
Kazmania here was trying to swim back to japan.
Ok.
I' ll wait for you up here.
- You ok?
- Yes.
Come on.
You're a maniac.
- Last night, I told my boss off.
- Oh, yeah.
Good for you.
Was he awake?
Are you kidding?
I was on him good.
I was on him like hair on a gorilla.
- Where do you get these expressions?
- Tv.
You're coming around, kazmonaut.
Took you long enough.
Yes, we screwed this up good.
Ah, dammit.
You know when you think of all the shit we did wrong, and it's an impressive amount, we were this close to pulling this thing off.
This close to doing it.
Well, look.
I made some big mistakes.
Is it just me, or do you hate the way wet shorts feel?
- I actually kind of like it.
- Really?
What a waste.
- This could've been big.
- That's what kills me.
Yes, I feel like you.
I' d love another chance.
I know we could do better.
Get outta here.
- Where do you think you're going?
- I' m going to work.
Hey, hey.
What work?
They shut down.
Why are you with him?
Kaz?
He's going back to work with me.
- Aren't you in enough trouble?
- Where's your uncle?
Ramada inn coffee shop, eating pancakes.
Tell him we made a deal with these men.
By 7.30 tomorrow, there will be 15,000 cars.
If he's a man of honour, he'll keep his promise and give these men their raises.
Certainly.
I will tell him you said that.
Now!
My wife had baby girl!
Congratulations.
We still got 1,000 cars to build, thought we'd go knock 'em off.
- 1,000 cars.
Two of you.
- We're gonna skip lunch.
This shouldn't be too bad.
Hell, these at the end of the line here are almost done.
- Well, what are they doing?
- They're building a car.
Hey, hunt.
This whole thing is an insult to my intelligence, man.
- Is that possible?
- Really, I' m serious.
All right, ha, ha.
He thinks if we see him working, we'll rush in and help.
Ok.
There's one.
- What'd that take us, twenty minutes?
- Four hours.
Why?
Just tell me, why is he doing it?
He wants to look good for the japs.
He's covering his ass.
- I don't buy that.
- Give me another reason.
I tell you what, maybe he's just trying to save this town.
Hey, hunt.
We're here.
Yes!
No, no, no.
Not everywhere.
Here, here, here and here.
Got it?
We could use another man on the wipers.
Hunt, sakamoto-san is here.
How are things going?
- Ito says we're short.
- It's close.
We're going so fast, it's hard to keep count.
But we look short.
Ok.
By seven-thirty, he's going to start counting cars.
- While he counts the cars...
- we keep building.
Good idea.
Boys, on the last few, we may have to cut a few corners.
All right?
Just little things like... engines.
Maybe I will not take the trouble to count.
I understand you question my honour.
I did not question it, I counted on it.
Human forklift comin' through.
Get this one down off the jack.
No, one bolt, not four bolts.
Don't count this one.
Pat, don't bolt 'em on, just stick 'em on.
We'll do that tomorrow.
14,994.
That's all.
That's not enough.
Wait a minute.
We still have cars inside.
Why didn't you bring them out?
Good question.
Let's go find out.
He's coming!
Hey!
Where you fellas been?
We've been standing around here for a couple of hours waiting for you cowboys.
There you go!
Well, there they are.
More than enough.
Drinks are on me.
Safety glass.
Ow!
My head!
I' ll make a list of everything that is wrong with these cars.
Hey, wait a minute.
Are you leaving?
- Yes.
- Just like that?
You were six cars short.
Oh, ok.
Six cars short.
Ok.
I tell you, you're making a big mistake.
Why did you say that?
Why do I say that?
- Let's talk about the pittsburgh game.
- Oh, my god!
We're down 16 points going into the 4th quarter.
People got up and left.
They missed the greatest comeback in the history of that tournament.
- Do you get my point?
- Not at all.
If you walk out that door, you're going to miss a great comeback.
We're ready to roll here, jack.
This will never be like a japanese factory, jack.
Oh, yeah?
You're right.
You know what else?
So what?
You failed.
Really?
You know what?
I got one of the first cars ever made here.
The first car.
I don't think I want it any more.
As a matter of fact, here, why don't you take the keys?
I' d rather have one of those cars.
I' d rather have one of these cars we made together by hand.
Your guys and my guys, together.
You know why?
'Cause those cars stand for something.
Those cars stand for something pretty great.
I' m proud of those cars.
I' m taking one.
Gentlemen...
I' m going home in my new car.
I thought it handled great.
Here, uncle, here is everything that is substandard on all these cars.
That's some list!
Good team.
Good men.
You will fix those before they leave the factory.
I will.
I will?
I like you.
You make me laugh.
I don't see anything wrong with these cars.
Are you crazy?
Congrat-lation!
Fifteen thousand cars.
Nephew.
Good luck in your new job.
Let's rock.

lieutenant:
what if he can read our minds?
captain:
he'll be real mad when he gets to me.
lieutenant:
keep quiet.
daddy, i'm scared.
aren't you supposed to be in bed?
daddy, there's a man in my room.
sweetie, you just had a nightmare.
i was not.
i saw him, mommy it's my turn, i guess.
mm-hmm.
i think i'll just have to go see who is bothering my little girl.
and if he can read minds then he's going to be real mad when he gets to mine.
he was over there, daddy.
he was watching me.
there's nothing there, megan.
see, it's clothes.
he scared me, daddy.
i know, megan, but it was just a nightmare.
now, my big girl won't be afraid of some little nightmare, is she?
hmm?
come on, come on.
in you go.
now, look, okay.
can you keep a secret?
well, when i was a little kid i had a lot of nightmares.
monsters... monsters?
i mean, they were in the closet they were under the bed they were everywhere.
but my dad told me the secret and then i wasn't scared anymore.
monsters... cannot get you... if you hide under the blankets.
they can't?
they can't.
that's the rule.
even monsters can't break the rules.
that's my girl.
that's good.
you see, the only problem with that theory is that blankets can't hide you from daddies.
(laughing and giggling) okay, okay.
calm down.
now, you're going to sleep, right?
right.
good night, kitten.
(helicopters and rifle fire)
oh, sorry.
jeff?
what's wrong?
god, you look like death warmed over.
no, it's nothing.
i'll tell you, honey, i thought... what?
nah, it's absurd.
it's like daughter, like father.
oh, and the man-- it was a chair full of clothes.
well, she has your imagination.
yeah, i was wondering where it went.
she's okay, right?
yes.
yeah, sure.
(creaking wheels)
hi, daddy.
hey, hi.
hi. mm.
all right. hello, hello.
i have roast beef.
i have baked potatoes.
i have salad, and i have... wine.
not for you.
you get milk.
all right?
how does that sound?
like paradise regained.
why don't you go wash up, honey.
hey, what's wrong?
wrong?
now, what makes you think something is wrong?
clues, sherlock.
the last time you served wine was the day your car got banged up in the school lot.
so, what is it this time?
this morning in class, a student asked me where i was during vietnam.
so, i told him i was in school.
you were.
i remember it distinctly.
i neglected to tell him it was in canada.
it's none of his business.
that's what i told him.
so, why do i feel so guilty?
i'm doing it again, aren't i?
mm-hmm.
okay.
now is this the part where you're suppose to tell me i didn't do anything wrong?
you didn't do anything wrong.
good, she still remembers all her lines.
you are a perfect woman.
thank you.
meggie, come on down.
dinner's ready.
megan?
megan?
honey, you didn't wash your hands.
the man was upstairs, mommy.
he talked to me.
oh, honestly.
now, come on.
let's get you scrubbed up for dinner.
it's okay to play pretend but you mustn't blame somebody else if you forget to do something.
it's not pretend, mommy.
okay, that's a little better.
jeff!
jeff!
what's wrong?
did you see him?
did he pass you?
what?
who?
the man in the wheelchair.
he was in the mirror.
he was in the hall.
i saw him in the mirror and then he just... he must have come past you.
a man in a wheelchair?
i would have noticed somebody coming past me in a wheelchair.
besides, how could a chair get down these stairs?
if he didn't come past you, then he's still... he's gone, mommy.
oh, meggie.
don't be scared.
he's a nice man.
what the hell is going on here?
(whispering:) jeff... i don't know.
i think it's time i found out.
ohh... what is wrong with you?
who are you?
don't freak on me, spaceman.
i need you, man.
no, this can't be happening.
what the hell's wrong?
no, no!
(screaming) shut up, spaceman.
shut up!
(screaming)
jeff!
jeff!
jeff, it's me.
it's just me.
it's just me, sweetie.
it's just me.
i, uh... i'm the reason he's here.
you didn't do anything.
i can think of something.
i got drafted but i chose canada.
i copped out on vietnam.
and now it looks like vietnam is catching up with me.
maybe vietnam was my fate.
maybe i was supposed to die there.
and maybe this... legless ghost is the guy... who went instead of me.
or maybe he got killed because i wasn't there.
no!
this is your guilt talking, not you.
you said no to a dirty little undeclared war.
you helpedstopthat war.
you know that!
all i know is i have to leave, because then he'll follow me and you and megan will be safe.
maybe, but maybe not.
jeff-- we've got to face this together.
well, you're right.
you are right.
no!
oh, god, no.
not again.
calm down.
it's all right!
jeff!
jeff!
wait!
(intercom beeps) yes, susan?
your husband's on five.
thank you.
where have you been?
i've been so worried.
denise... is it you?
of course it's me.
are you all right?
you sound really strange.
strange?
no, i'm fine, denni.
how are you?
denni?
you haven't called me denni since high school.
jeff?
what is going on?
i just... i just need to see you, denni.
just for a little while.
i'm at home now, and i need to see you.
okay.
okay, i'll be right there.
hi, susan.
jeff... are you all right?
i spent the night in my car.
is denise here?
she went home right after you called.
right after i... i didn't call.
i put you through not ten minutes ago.
i should be able to recognize your voice by now.
denni... come here!
honey?
jeff?
you're looking real good.
you look even better than you did back when we were together.
oh, god.
what... what... what happened?
is that the question?
what happened?
vietnam happened, denni.
and the draft lottery.
and a land mine.
denise?
jeff?
denni... i'm up here!
jeff, i'm up here!
honey, move back.
all right, you... you're me.
that's bingo.
then this isn't happening.
a dream?
yeah, right.
but are you dreaming me or am i dreaming you?
i don't give a damn one way or the other.
you see, i think we're both real.
i think that somewhere around 1971 we came to this fork in the road and you went one way, and i went the other.
and we ended up in different places.
jeff?
spaceman.
on your road, what happened... to us?
to us.
oh, denni, yeah. you and me.
oh, well.
gee.
you died in a motorcycle accident when i was in 'nam.
the guy you were riding with didn't believe in helmets.
that's why you're here-- because...
i'm guilty.
i'm guilty, okay.
that's all right.
but if there's any retribution owed then it's to me and to me alone.
you have to leave them out of it now.
no!
we went to canada together.
we made the decision together.
i'm a part of him and everything that happens to him.
that's why i loved you so much, denni.
and you... come on.
you think i would hurt them?
god. and they say us vets are crazy!
then tell me why.
i'm dying, man.
the doctors, they never tell you what's really going on, but i could feel it.
and it's okay.
i lost everything important to me a long time ago.
i lost my legs.
i lost my girl.
i lost my future.
i even lost jeff.
and the spaceman-- ooh, yeah, i mean, come on.
he doesn't have much going on except some really horrible memories.
so, you know, i'm laying in the v.a.
and i'm just waiting to get it over with.
come on.
and i'm thinking... and i'm wondering... how it would have been with denni and me.
you know, if i'd have done it differently.
and i'm laying there.
and i'm wondering.
and i guess i just wondered myself here.
i just wanted to see them, brother.
you did okay, mcdowell.
youdid okay.
i wasn't even there.
i wasn't there either-- i mean, i wasn't there for denise.
i wasn't there for megan.
(sobs)
ah, come on.
i think... i think it's probably time i went.
no, you can stay...
if you want to.
yeah, well... i mean, i'd like to.
it would be nice but i can't.
i, uh... i got some nice memories now, though.
thanks.
the flashbacks-- i mean, it must work both ways.
you and me, we're the same person, right?
i have some memories.
i have some good memories.
maybe if we touched... no, you don't know what you're talking about now.
but i have good memories-- the day that denise and i got married.
our honeymoon.
the day megan was born.
no, it's no good, see?
'cause then you'd have all that stuff about all those men dying around you then you'd have all the years in the hospital and in this damn chair.
no, and then you'd remember everybody backing away from you.
everybody watching you, watching you, you know?
i mean, you'd be waking up with nightmares.
you'd be screaming.
i'm not afraid of a few nightmares.
i can always just crawl under the blanket.
i guess we're both heroes, huh?
narrator:
we make our choices, and afterwards wonder what the other road was like.
jeff mcdowell found out, and paid the toll.
a lesson in courage and cartography from the map makers... ofthe twilight zone.
Go, Thomas!
Kick it, T. M!
Kick it.
Now what do we do?
Don't ask me.
You've got the gun.
You see, it's my little sister.
She's missing.
I need to know something about her.
What does she do?
She's a hooker, like me.
I was looking to get my rug shampooed.
Boy, you've come to the right place.
She almost got me killed.
I thought that was behind us.
And you're beginning to annoy me.
It could get worse.
Appearances can sometimes be deceiving.
For instance, it may have looked like Rick, T.C., Kenny and I were having a whole lot of fun as we ran our hearts out training for the King Kamehameha Club Charity Track and Field Games.
Well, yeah, we were having fun.
But the word "fun" hardly describes the feeling you get when you know your body is as finely tuned as it can be.
Every muscle working in complete coordination with the other, instantly reacting to the spontaneous impulses emitting from the brain, a perfect mesh of body and mind.
Go, Thomas!
Kick, it, T. M!
Kick it!
Then, you know what the word "invincible" really means.
Hey, man, don't try and get up.
Take it easy, buddy.
Get some ice, little brother.
Twisted, huh, Thomas?
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
Oh, that's a shame.
Looks like Duke's gonna have to take your place.
Duke will not have to take my place.
I'll be fine.
I'll just walk it off.
Come on, T.C.
I don't think you should walk on it too soon.
Oh, Jeez.
Here comes Duke now with the ice.
It's just a minor sprain!
Two longnecks, one ice tea, and bring a bag of ice.
Right away.
I'll be fine for the race.
Come on!
You know, I don't know.
At your age, these kind of things take longer to heal.
What do you mean, "at my age"?
My age is your age, too!
Nothing wrong with my ankles.
Look, Thomas, I think what T.C.'s trying to tell you is if your ankle isn't any better by this time next week, well, we'll have to get Kenny's younger brother, Duke.
Then we can still win the race.
Yeah.
Besides, he's faster than you.
No, he isn't!
Well, he's faster than you guys, too.
Yes.
But all of our ankles work.
Oh, come on, give me a break.
Oh, shoot!
I'm sorry.
Here, let me...
You?
It's me.
Hi, Thomas.
Leslie?
It was kind of inevitable, wasn't it?
What was?
Us bumping into each other again, so to speak.
What's going on?
I guess I forgot to tell you.
I guess so.
Well, Leslie came back into town and she kind of needed a job.
So I figured hey, what the hell, after everything that she did for you when you were a hotel investigator.
Detective.
Well, whatever.
Anyway, she...
Anyway, she almost got me killed.
Well, you did!
I thought that was behind us.
Look, I got a real job now, a straight job, and I was just kind of hoping that once you knew that...
She's right, man.
I mean, the Vice Squad can't arrest her for serving drinks.
Unless, of course, she serves drinks to minors.
But you hardly qualify for that, because most kids have good ankles.
You were hoping for what?
Whoops!
I forgot.
I got to meet Higgins in the Anuenue Room.
He's got some English blokes lined up for an aerial tour of the Islands.
Well, it was nice seeing you again.
Bye!
Rick?
Um, I gotta help him coordinate.
And stay off that gam!
You don't look very happy to see me.
No, that's not true.
It's just kind of a shock.
A shock!
How?
What way?
Well, I mean, to find you here, working.
A job where I stand up?
No!
Working here.
I'm so happy you said that, Thomas.
Hey, honey, how about another round?
Coming right up.
Mai tais, right?
You got a good memory.
Thanks.
Look, I'll call you later, explain everything.
There's something really important that I want to talk to you about.
Can you get me a beer?
Sure!
You know something?
My memory's not so bad either.
You're beginning to look real familiar.
Oh, all waitresses look the same.
Nah, I've seen you someplace.
Come on, man, take it easy.
I have!
You're real distinctive, lady.
Mister, I have only been in Hawaii for two days.
I have never seen you before.
I think you're wrong!
I think you know exactly where you've seen me.
Why don't you let the lady do her job?
Say what, friend?
I said, why don't you let the lady do her job?
All right?
Thomas, it's okay.
Hey!
Why don't you mind your own business?
I'm trying.
Thomas!
So, honey, when do you get off?
Oh, come on.
That's it!
Now, look.
Please leave now!
Hey, you can't tell me to leave!
My name is Ron Phillips, I'm a member here.
And you're beginning to annoy me.
It could get worse.
Hey, that's a threat!
Did you hear that?
He's threatening me!
No, I'm not threatening you.
I'm asking you very politely, before I call the manager, to please leave now!
Thomas!
Just a minute.
I'm handling this.
Hey!
I'll kill you!
I'll punch you silly!
I'll rip your hair out!
I'll rip your eyes out!
Oh, my God!
How could you?
You broke my nail, you creep!
Police officer!
Freeze!
That was positively the most disgraceful exhibition that I have ever seen!
Even rivaling the time that you unleashed that python at Mr. Masters' dinner party!
I didn't unleash it!
I was on a case.
A woman fainted!
The right woman!
It worked.
Perhaps then, in that instance, there was some justification.
Today's debacle at the Club had none.
I am therefore suspending your privileges there for one month!
You can't do that!
I'll call Robin!
I am quite certain that he will support my stand.
By the by, have you had that ankle looked at?
No!
You should.
At your age, these things can take a long time to heal.
Higgins, I happen to come from a long line of fast healers.
If it's not in shape,
I hear that Kenny's younger brother, Duke, has an amazing closing kick.
Perhaps, for the good of the team, you should consider withdrawing from the race.
I am not withdrawing!
Well, I am.
Good day, Magnum.
Is he gone?
Yes, he's gone!
Well, what's that supposed to mean?
What?
Nothing.
I was just answering your question.
You want me to go, too?
That's what it sounded like.
Look, I can take a hint.
I didn't say that.
Well, you meant it.
I didn't mean anything!
Okay, fine.
So you couldn't use the clutch and I had to drive you home.
But you're not stuck with me.
I'll call a cab.
Oh, come on, Leslie!
Put that down.
Please, come on.
Leslie, I don't know what it is between you and me, but we don't seem to be able to spend five minutes in the same place without screaming or storming out on each other.
I like you.
I really do.
And I really admire what you're trying to do with your life, but...
We just seem to rub each other the wrong way.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, you're probably right.
We're kind of like oil and orange juice sometimes.
Yeah, you're right.
I'll just keep trying with my job.
After all, you can't go near the place anyway for a month, and then we'll just see what happens.
Okay?
Okay.
Friends?
Sure.
Oh, there's one thing I forgot.
Remember I said I wanted to talk to you about something just before you got sucker-punched?
Yeah, I remember.
What did you want to talk about?
I want to talk to you about seeing me professionally.
Nope, that came out wrong.
I mean you professionally.
I want to hire you, Thomas, as a private investigator.
You see, it's my little sister.
She called and left a message that she was in trouble and now she's missing.
I need your help.
Do you really have to do that?
It makes me feel better, and it should make you feel better.
You are where you live, you know.
Hmm.
Leslie, tell me something.
Do you really have a sister?
Yes!
Well, I just thought I'd ask, 'cause last time you kind of overwhelmed me with stories about grandmothers, and kidney machines, and...
And anything else I could think of to get you to help me.
Besides, embellishments just kind of come naturally to me, I guess.
But this is real.
Patty is very real, and I want you to find her.
How old is she?
Twenty-two.
Twenty-three?
Well, it's been a few years.
Yes, it sounds like you come from a very close family.
Well, the family may not be close, but Patty and I are.
And when was the last time you saw her?
Um, 1978.
Sorry, no, that was Mary I haven't seen since '78.
We're also a large family.
Just show you this.
That's Patty, and that's me.
Yeah, it has been a few years.
But we talk, though.
Sometimes.
I want to understand this.
I really do.
Uh, you've moved back to Hawaii.
Then you conned Rick into giving you a job you have no evident aptitude or inclination for, so you could hire me to find an alleged sister who you haven't seen for years.
Am I close?
I knew you'd say no.
I didn't say no!
Yet.
Why did you go through this circuitous route?
Why didn't you just call and ask me?
Because this is precisely the attitude
I would have expected from you, Thomas.
Precisely.
I knew it.
I guess I just stupidly thought that if you saw me making an honest effort at life, with a straight job and everything, that you would take me seriously.
Now, that, Leslie, that is precisely the kind of logic that always seems to get you in trouble.
Now, if you'd just been direct with me, I would have...
Said no.
That's not true.
All right, I'll be direct.
I'll be real direct.
I've always been pretty selfish.
Looked out for number one, let the world take care of itself.
But right now, my sister is out there somewhere, in trouble, maybe hurt, and the only person that can help her is me.
And I just thought that the only person that could help me was you.
But I can understand if you don't want to get involved.
It's not your problem.
I gave it my best shot and you said no, so I guess I'll just have to go on by myself.
Leslie, wait!
But I will go on by myself because, for once in my life, I'd like to think that I did the right thing!
Leslie, wait!
For no other reason except the fact...
I can't keep up!
...that somebody really needs me, and I put aside my own petty problems to help them out.
Leslie, I'm trying to tell you I'll do it!
Thank you, Thomas.
You're welcome!
Now, I need to know something about her.
What does she do?
Um, she's a hooker, like me.
I'm not exactly sure why I agreed to help Leslie find this missing sister of hers.
But, then again, maybe I am.
Maybe it all goes back to the "appearances can be deceiving" syndrome.
I mean, yes, Leslie has embellished in the past, to the point of nearly getting me killed.
But I had a feeling that this time she wasn't embellishing, that she really was determined to help her sister out.
Besides, when you have a car like a Ferrari, well, just like a racehorse, it needs a workout.
Leslie, this is the fourth time that we have been around the block!
Are you forgetting the address?
No, I did not forget the address.
I just want to make sure it's clear.
Ah!
Now, this is what I'm talking about, Leslie.
You have to be more direct.
You just want to make sure what is clear?
The coast!
What coast?
To Cleo's apartment!
Remember her?
My friend.
Besides, if her pimp's around, forget it.
But that's why you're here, right?
Never mind.
Okay.
Now, this is a very powerful car, it's going to be hard to maneuver.
Be careful.
My horoscope for the month said to get ready for some surprises.
Well, I just got that.
But it also said I'd be marrying rich, too.
Oh, well, one out of two ain't bad, I guess.
Leslie, honey, you are flooring me.
A waitress?
And the former hotel detective, too.
Aw!
You're still cute.
Thank you.
And you're still ducking me, Cleo.
What do you know about Patty?
That depends.
Please, Cleo, I gotta find her!
A whole lot of people are thinking that way, too.
But if you're going to bring muscle, which you're going to need, you should've brought one that can walk.
He'll do.
Won't he, though.
Cut it out, Cleo!
He's working!
For me!
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
It's just that sometimes...
Never mind.
Patty!
That was taken at the Prince Kuhio Fair three weeks ago.
Which was the last time you heard from her.
Right!
Which was the last time anybody ever heard from her.
I don't know if you know this, but she was working down in Waikiki, and word has it she was skimming from her man.
Oh!
What happened?
What usually happens.
Wherever she is on this rock, I wouldn't want to be under there with her, that's all I can say.
Who's her "man"?
He calls himself "The Mighty Flinn."
Oh, hell!
Uh, Cleo, who is he?
I don't know who he is, but I know what he is.
Take care of her.
Well, where do I find him?
He usually finds you.
Thanks.
Um, call me?
Sometimes?
Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one...
All right!
Hi, guys.
Hey, Thomas.
How's the ankle?
Oh, better.
I ought to...
Get some rest.
I mean, Duke is really tearing up the splits.
I'll be fine.
I'll be ready for the race.
Well, we don't want to rush things.
I mean, if we have a winning combination, we don't want to mess it up just because of a foolish sense of pride.
Pride's got nothing to do with it!
I'll let you guys talk.
How could you guys?
How could we what?
How could you try and manipulate me out of this race?
Because we want to win!
Well, okay, fine.
I won't anchor.
I'm still faster than Rick.
Um, speed isn't everything, Thomas.
At least my ankle and I will finish.
Oh, by the way, I got that info you wanted on that Flinn guy.
He's one tough customer, baby.
According to Ice Pick, he keeps the obit sections in the newspaper alive.
So I've been told.
Where is he?
At his business.
And I bet you I know what that is.
Probably some waterfront dive or gambling parlor...
Uh, he runs a rug shampooing business.
Thanks.
Thank Ice Pick.
But I don't think he did you any favors.
Tell him I'll be ready.
Island Breeze.
That reminds me of when Patty and I played jump rope as kids.
Her favorite rhyme was,
"Tropical breeze tickles your knees.
How many islands can you see?
"One, two, three, four, five, six...
Leslie...
"...seven, eight, nine..."
I get the idea.
Wait here.
I'll try.
And don't move.
Hi.
Can I help you?
I was looking to get my rug shampooed.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you've come to the right place.
Well, most of my business is telephone order.
Who referred you?
A friend.
A good friend.
Easy on the soap, girls.
Uh-huh.
Look, fella, I need a reference.
Okay, what's your name?
Randolph Williams.
Randolph Williams.
Okay, you leave a credit card or $200 and just tell me when, okay?
And maybe who?
Look, pal, just one time, in English.
Well, my friend said that the person who cleaned his condo was a young blonde about 22, 23, and he said she did a very good job.
Doesn't ring a bell.
Maybe you should...
Maybe I should talk to some of your maintenance people.
I...
Hold it right there!
Where is she?
That's my gun!
Where's who?
Where'd you get my gun?
I cleaned up your place, remember?
I must have stuck it in my purse.
Patty Emory, my sister.
What did you do to her?
I think the two of you better leave.
Not until you start talking.
I think we better leave, too.
Are you crazy?
No, you are!
What if we forget the whole thing?
No.
Now what do we do?
Don't ask me, you've got the gun.
Come on, Thomas, let's go!
Thomas, this is hardly the time to wimp out!
Just kidding.
Come on!
Leave now.
Okay, suffer.
But it's not gonna be my fault if you can't run in your dumb race on Saturday.
Yes, it is.
Because of you, it's worse.
I'll have you know that I am a certified physical therapist.
I'm sure you are.
Just exactly what do you mean by that?
Certifiable!
That's what I mean!
And you're completely irresponsible, and crazy, and to make matters worse, you made me break Robin's antique walking stick!
Oh, big deal!
I'm sure he's got another one.
Another one?
Another one?
Do you have any idea, any conception, of how hard one of these...
Never mind.
Just get out of my life, now!
On my way!
On my way!
But I am still going to find Patty, with you or without you.
Oh, great!
Good luck.
Just let the cops know who the next of kin is to notify.
Damn it!
She is my next of kin!
Leslie, please don't break anything else.
But I really want to!
Go ahead.
Leslie, just tell me why you barged in there with my gun.
I guess I was trying to be direct.
Oh, great.
That's wonderful.
You know, that's real improvement.
But what sense did it make?
You know, if Flinn is also after Patty, then he's not going to know where she is either.
Right?
Right.
Right!
Now, my plan was to talk to one of the girls.
That was the only way we were going to get another clue.
Now all that's been accomplished, besides just about getting both of us killed and setting my ankle back two more days, and breaking Robin's antique walking stick, is that Flinn is going to be looking for her that much harder
and you and I have absolutely nothing to go on!
"You and I"?
Does that mean you're not quitting on me?
You're not, are you?
I think your shift starts at the Club in about a half an hour.
Yeah, you're right, I'd better...
But then, how can I help you?
You can't, you mustn't, and you won't!
But...
But nothing!
Take the Ferrari.
But what about you?
You can't drive.
I'll take the Audi.
It's an automatic.
Thank you, Thomas.
You're welcome.
You know what?
What?
You're a knight.
A knight in armor.
No, I'm not.
I'm just a private investigator doing his job for a client he cares about.
I'm going to find your sister.
Thank you.
I know what you're thinking, and you're right.
I never should have borrowed such a valuable antique in the first place.
And if I had to explain it to him, I knew Higgins would understand.
Hi, Higgins.
That is my desk.
Yes, I know.
I was just relaxing for a minute.
On my desk?
Do you need it?
It's quite irrelevant whether I need it or not.
The point is that one doesn't simply lounge around on another man's desk.
So you don't need it.
As a matter of fact, I do.
Now, if you're quite finished loafing about...
Oh, Higgins.
You caught me red-handed.
I wasn't actually relaxing on your desk.
I mean, you know how important it is to the Club that I run in that relay race.
And you also know that my ankle has been giving me a tiny little bit of trouble.
So, I thought...
No.
"No" what?
Whatever it is of Robin's you want to beg, borrow, or steal, no.
Higgins, I...
I am hurt.
I mean, I didn't come here to beg or borrow anything.
I came here to ask you, as an expert in the field of homeopathic medicine, your advice.
Now, you can call that stealing if you'd like.
You want my advice?
Only if you want to give it to me.
I'm sorry, Magnum, I misjudged you.
The ankle, is it?
Right.
Quite.
I do seem to recall a similar incident.
Where is that chapter on Lizard Island?
You don't mind if I walk around a little?
I just don't want it to stiffen up.
I'm listening, though.
Ah, here it is.
A young Kanaka boy traveling with our unit fell down the river embankment into the waiting jaws of a ravenous crocodile.
Naturally, I killed the crocodile with one well-placed shot.
But it took several hours to pry the young lad's leg loose, even though the crocodile was dead.
I formulated a concoction of local herbs and river-bed clay to put on the wound overnight, which, if I say so myself, was a miraculous cure.
Some of the elements may be a trifle difficult to come up with here on the Island.
However, I feel quite certain that, with a little persistence...
It seems to be working already.
Okay, so I hadn't been completely 100º/º truthful with Higgins, and I had even stretched the truth a little bit with Leslie when I told her we had absolutely nothing to go on in terms of finding Patty.
Even once I found a list of employee records and various clients, that was still basically true.
But at least it wasn't absolutely nothing.
In here.
We'd better hurry!
How utterly fascinating.
Some of the more prominent personages on the Island are listed in this ledger, including my accountant.
Surprise, surprise.
Oh, and Ron Phillips, the guy who started the fight at the Club.
And you contend that this Flinn was supplying them all with rug shampooers?
Including my sister Patty.
Oh, by the way, Thomas, I just wanted to thank you for...
Please don't.
For what?
Nothing.
For letting me take the Ferrari.
Higgins, could you just check this last name on the list, J. Barnett, see if it rings a bell?
His billing address is across from the State Legislature, and if anybody'd know a guy like that, it would certainly be you.
You let her drive the Ferrari?
See, uh, he was Patty's last customer.
That's the place to start.
And his secretary wouldn't take Thomas's call, so...
I'll see what I can do.
Great.
Thanks, Mr. Higgins.
About the Ferrari...
I think he wants us to leave the room.
Hello, Valerie?
This is Jonathan.
Is the Senator in?
Jay Barnett is a plastic lobbyist.
You mean the little wind-up kind with a key in his back?
If you're going to prevail upon me to do your legwork for you, then the least I would expect is a minimum of silliness.
You're right.
I'm sorry, Higgins.
Go on.
As a matter of fact, he represents the entire plastics industry in the State Legislature.
He believes you to be a representative of a Mainland company that wishes to relocate here.
Well, that's terrific.
Thank you, Higgins.
Listen, you're not gonna get in any trouble with this, are you?
I mean, using your connections to get me in to see this guy under false pretenses?
Probably.
But your cause is worthy.
If he has anything to do with that poor girl's disappearance, well,
I hope you nail his miserable hide.
Hello?
Yeah, it's me.
Is Leslie with you?
No.
She went to work.
Oh, yeah?
Then, how come she didn't show up?
She's really messing me up.
I don't think you're the only one.
Leslie?
Yes!
She did it again.
More on "appearances can be deceiving."
Sometimes they're not.
Sometimes, no matter what you try not to see in someone, it's still going to be there.
Zebras still have stripes, leopards spots, and Leslie, one thick-headed, one-track mind.
But at least I could be thankful for a couple of things.
Barnett's home address, for one, automatic transmission, for another, and finally,
I was thankful, in advance, for having the cleverness and foresight to get to Barnett before Leslie did.
Who is it?
Thomas Magnum.
We have an appointment.
Small world.
It could get a lot smaller if you don't get out of here.
What's the matter, Jay?
Get out of here!
You two old friends?
The first time I ever saw her was the other day at the Club.
But my buddy Ron used to rent her, if you want references.
What about that project we were working on?
I lost interest.
Cancel the appointment.
Cancel everything.
What project?
Nothing.
I don't know what he's talking about.
Maybe you'd better tell me who you really are.
Last and final postscript to "appearances can be deceiving."
Sometimes it's not worth figuring out whether they are or not.
For example, it could have taken me weeks, maybe months, to sort through the half-truths and white lies to find the real reason Leslie had for being in Barnett's apartment.
And then, I could start in on the interesting stuff.
Like, what was Leslie's real relationship with the pimp named Flinn?
And had she ever had a sister named Patty?
But I couldn't see why I should spend one more minute trying to find the trees through the forest of lies.
Unless Leslie really was in trouble and was trying to protect me with that little act of hers.
Sometimes I think life would be a great deal easier without a little voice nagging at me when things don't seem just right.
And once again, it looked like my little voice was right.
All I could hope for was that Leslie had left me some kind of a clue.
But I wasn't counting on much.
Fortunately, that's usually when I get a little lucky.
"Tickles your knees, Island Breeze."
Obviously, Leslie had found a way to leave me a message that Flinn had Patty, and maybe Leslie, too.
But I knew that he wouldn't risk hiding them out at his office.
Especially when he had a nice big warehouse tucked away in a rundown part of town.
I know what you're thinking.
Maybe most of this was my fault.
After all, I'm the one who told Leslie to be direct.
But, on the other hand, I didn't tell her to be too direct!
Especially with the wrong guys.
On the other hand, I suppose it was possible that I was, in some small way, responsible for Jay figuring out she had ulterior motives for being there.
But, on the other hand, despite being hopelessly outnumbered,
I did have a plan.
A darn good one.
One that could very well save Leslie and her sister Patty.
I don't care what you do, just get rid of her!
I'm not exactly in the business of cleaning up after sloppy politicians.
My buddy Ron told me you were reliable and discreet.
I do business with you one time, and I got nothing but problems.
Now, you do something about it, or you're going to have to find a new line of work.
Patty Emory, I presume?
Hey!
Shriners convention, 1983!
Shh!
No, no, no.
You don't know me.
But I'm kind of a friend of your sister's.
You're with Leslie!
You guys are here to rescue me!
Oh, God, I can't believe it!
I thought I was a dead person.
Hey, what took you so long?
I hope you don't mind the long route.
Be careful.
What about Leslie?
I'll get to her in a minute.
What the hell did you do to get so many people mad at you?
Uh, nothing.
Really.
Well, Flinn sent me over to Barnett's place.
So he and Barnett are connected?
No.
No, I was just supposed to go over there to deliver the weekly special, if you know what I mean?
Anyway, I found some papers.
Some correspondence that would have gotten Barnett in a whole lot of trouble unless he was willing to pay a small finder's fee to recover them.
So you're blackmailing Barnett?
Well, I kind of like to think of it as a shrewd financial move to set myself up in business.
Patty's Palmistry Parlor.
I give great readings.
All right, that's enough.
Now we're gonna have to get rid of both of these dames.
Great!
I just don't want to know anything about it.
What exactly do you mean by "get rid of"?
Shut up!
Now go get the other one!
Come on, get her out of here!
Wait a minute!
Where am I going?
Just because I'm a hooker doesn't mean I don't have a right to my dreams-come-true.
I didn't say you didn't, but nobody's gonna have any dreams come true unless I can get you and your sister out of here.
Now, wait here.
I have friends who know exactly where I am.
And they're going to come looking for me if I don't call in in five minutes.
Hey, boss, she's gone!
Well, find her, stupid!
What are we gonna do?
Kenny!
Throw it in, Flinn.
It's over.
Oh, wow!
I haven't had this much fun since the 1968 State Fair when my sister Mary won the hog-riding contest!
Or was that Wendy?
Bunny!
Scooter?
Scooter!
Bunny!
I see you've met my sister.
Bunny!
Oh, man.
Duke, you okay?
I think I broke my leg.
How's your ankle?
Welcome to the King Kamehameha Club Charity Track and Field Games.
The first event of the day, the 440-yard relay, will begin in three minutes.
I brought you some water.
I don't understand why you're not running this race with the rest of your team.
Why'd you tell them I would do it?
Because I made a deal.
Huh?
I made a deal with Kenny.
He and his brother would help me at the warehouse, and I would withdraw from the race, let Duke run instead.
Yeah, but Duke broke his ankle.
That's their problem, not mine.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going back to my seat.
Hey!
Don't you think you're being a little bit petulant?
No!
I think your pride and ego are hurt.
I also think part of this is you're mad at me, too.
You're mad because I stole Jay Barnett's address and jumped the gun.
All right.
Yes, you're right.
Although this is hardly the time or place to bring it up.
Why in the hell would you do something so stupid?
Why?
I was just trying to do what you told me to do, be direct.
That's not direct, that's stupid.
Yeah, you're right.
It was stupid.
It was stupid of me to almost get myself killed when I could've just waited and let you handle it.
But do you want to know why I did something so stupid?
More than I can tell you.
The only reason I did something so stupid is because I love my sister.
And I just felt that the bottom line was, considering who we were going up against, that if anybody was going to get hurt, or worse, trying to get her back,
I'd rather it be me than you, because the other bottom line here is
I kind of, in a weird way, love you, too.
Well, you don't have to be that direct.
Hey, you don't have to take it so personally.
I love a lot of things.
Sunsets, piña coladas, do-wop.
I'd also love to see you run this damn race!
Runners to your marks.
Set...
Go get 'em, Thomas.
Some things in life just aren't fair.
This is one of them.
I suppose I could always call the police.
Or not.
I don't believe this.
Bedroom stripped, closet cleaned out.
"Kidnapped."
A thief with a sense of humour.
"Dear Mac, if you ever want to see your fridge alive, meet me at the west end of the airport, hangar 1 3.
Come alone, or the fridge fries."
Some folks might see the humour in something like this.
I don't happen to be one.
But I knew someone who would:
Jack Dalton.
I hadn't seen Jack Dalton in almost five years.
He, Mike Forrester and I had been like the Three Musketeers.
After college, we traipsed all over Europe together.
You had to give Jack one thing:
He knew how to have fun.
High-adventure, globe-trotting, no-holds-barred fun.
Tonight it started with looting my apartment.
And this very convenient open door told me it wasn't gonna stop there.
Jack Dalton.
Rogue, adventurer, liar, thief.
And there was living proof.
My hockey jersey.
It was starting to look to me like maybe Jack Dalton had a plan.
Well, so did I.
One might ask how I could be so sure this was the work of Jack Dalton.
Well, sometimes you just know.
Jack.
Come on, I know it's you.
My stuff.
Jack!
MacGyver, I'm flattered.
You came.
I had a choice?
Yo, Mac, where you going?
You're not steamed, are you?
Come on, it was a joke.
First, you're gonna come down here so I can punch you in the nose.
Then you're gonna load up all my stuff and take it back to my place.
You got that?
All right, I'm sorry.
If that's what you want, I'll put it all back.
- Good.
- Hey, Mac, please, don't go.
Where you going?
Mac!
I'm begging you.
Mac!
Jack!
You should see your face.
Priceless.
Oh, Mac, you haven't changed.
Not a bit.
- Neither have you, Jack.
- Yeah?
Thanks.
It wasn't a compliment.
Hey, Mac, you gotta cut me down.
Mac!
Mac, cut me down!
Come on, MacGyver, my head's about to explode here.
I knew you wouldn't leave me hanging.
You can call me "amigo" anytime.
If there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know, amigo.
Now, easy, easy.
Hey, watch my head!
Just like the tocotines.
In Papantla.
Remember, Mac?
When you and Mike and I were at the festival of Corpus Christi?
Always wanted to try that.
- What a rush.
- Jack, what do you want?
Right to the point, huh?
Good.
We can reminisce later.
I wanna talk.
I do have a phone.
At least I used to.
Yeah, but I couldn't be sure you'd come.
I need a favour.
- You know how to butter a guy up.
- Look, I got my own company now.
Jack Dalton, sole proprietor, Fly-by-Night air freight, at your service.
The official airline for slugs, scum and all manner of vermin.
Anyway, I was shall we say, transporting some very valuable orchids.
Shall we say smuggling?
That's an ugly word, Mac.
But, hey, at 1,000 bucks a plant, I can live with it.
Anyway, you know me.
What do I know about orchids?
Maybe how to spell it.
So I needed expert advice.
Botanists.
So where does the favour come in?
A little rescue mission to save the botanists.
- In Dinoto.
- Dinoto?
As in Central America, Dinoto?
- Yeah.
Come on, Mac.
- Yeah.
We can take my plane, be there in no time.
Think about it.
- Adventure.
Danger.
It'll be fun.
- Jack!
What have these botanists done?
Americans are being snatched all over the world, Mac.
I mean, you know how it is with these crazies.
You're lying, Jack.
About what, I don't know, but you're hiding something.
That hurts me, Mac.
How can you say that?
Your eye.
It still twitches when you're lying.
Look, I gotta do it, Mac.
It's my fault they're there.
Mac, please, a favour for a friend.
I'm begging you.
Why should I believe you?
You've never been straight about anything in your whole life.
And whatever happened to that looking-out-for-number-one, cut-your-losses-and-get-out-quick Jack Dalton we all knew and loved?
- He's changed.
- Yeah.
Wish I could believe that.
I'm dying, Mac.
- What?
- I'm dying.
No joke?
No joke.
And I just wanna do one thing right before I do.
All I said, Mac, was there was a remote chance that there's an ounce of truth to his story.
That's all.
Our sources do tell us that there's an American botanist in the country.
So you're telling me some botanists are missing?
Mac, what makes you think this isn't one of Jack's lies?
I don't know, Pete.
I think he's telling the truth this time.
Just a feeling.
Well, I don't like it.
The whole thing creaks.
Makes me nervous.
Careful, Pete, you're on a diet.
You know how you like to eat when you're nervous.
Listen, Mac, you know there is no way the Foundation can get involved in this, but if there's anything that I can do unofficially, call me, will you?
Thank you for using the telephone.
Your three minutes are up.
So, what's the deal?
Papa Thornton say you can come out and play?
Yeah.
Good.
Now we go to plane, kemosabe.
You follow.
I know I said I was gonna slug him.
But how do you hit a kid?
Shouldn't we be using charts or something?
Charts.
Shouldn't we be using charts?
What's the name on the plane, Mac?
- Fly-by-Night.
- Exactly.
Now, relax.
I know what I'm doing.
- Charts?
- Strongbox.
Hey, you found the pictures.
Where was that one taken again?
Martinique.
That was just before we went diving off the coral reef.
Oh, right.
That was the day we saw that shark feeding frenzy.
Remember?
Remember?
You started it.
That was the same day I cut my air hose on the coral.
You saved my life.
Hey, that's what buddies are for.
What else you got there?
It's you, me and Mike in Barbados.
You, me and Mike in Singapore.
You, me and Mike in Fresno.
- Those were good times.
- Yep.
So you seen Mike any lately?
You always were a little warm for her form.
It's been about four years.
Besides, you were the one that was always proposing to her.
Yeah, and she'd have said yes if she didn't think it'd have broke your heart.
Boy, it'd be great to get together again, just the three of us.
- One last great adventure.
- Yeah.
How about you, Jack?
- You seen Mike lately?
- No.
Been a long time.
Long time.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
We'd like to thank you for flying Fly-by-Night and welcome you to beautiful Dinoto, where the temperature is a balmy 83 degrees.
Please extinguish all smoking materials and bring your seatbacks and tray tables to their full upright position for landing.
Something tells me this isn't the only airport in town.
Customs can be such a bother, old boy.
Here we go, hold on.
You know, I feel good about this.
I didn't wanna say anything last night, but I had my doubts you'd even come.
However, you're here, the sun's up, it's a new day, and all's well on God's green earth.
Yes, indeed.
We'll be in and out in no time with my botanists.
Does anyone know you went for help?
Are you kidding?
I slipped out of here like a thief in the night.
No way anybody knows I was gone.
- You sure?
- Positive.
Capitán, capitán, I hear it.
Looks like you've been missed.
You wanna tell me what's going on?
Oh, my mistake.
Private airstrip.
- Jack, why are the police here?
- I could have sworn I told you.
Those are the guys we have to save the botanists from.
The police?
!
Take it easy, Mac.
I got a plan.
Jack, wouldn't you say we're running out of runway?
You worry too much, Mac.
Sometimes you don't worry enough!
Come on, faster!
Let's get them!
Hang on, Mac, I'm bringing her around.
What was that?
Tricks of me trade, Mac, me boyo.
Tricks of me trade.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna give them a burst of fresh air.
They're gaining on us.
Hang on.
We're turning again.
Beautiful!
Mac, I gotta tell you, it brought tears to my eyes.
Beautiful.
Now, tell me you're not having just a little bit of fun.
Crack shooting, Antunnez.
You got a bunch of real sharpshooters on your force.
Perhaps you'd like to test my marksmanship?
That's not just my money winging its way out of here.
No, you and I are like a team, amigo.
- I lose, you lose.
- He will not leave without the girl.
We will get your plants.
And then we will kill Jack Dalton.
Jack, why are we going down?
There's nothing but jungle around here.
I'm gonna put her down right there.
There?
Where's "there"?
I don't see a landing strip.
Neither do I, it's a cow pasture.
But sometimes sacrifices have to be made.
Hold on.
Hold on, now.
Little bump coming.
There we go, another nifty landing, Jack, my boy.
Smooth as a baby's bottom.
Pure as the driven snow.
Jack, would you mind telling me exactly what's going on?
Exactly what's going on is a little difficult.
But I'll give you a fair approximation.
I've got a place near here, a little hideout of sorts.
I like to think of it as my summer home.
Your summer home.
Get much company?
You're the first.
- They hit our fuel tank.
- Not to worry.
Someone has to.
Great job.
Put it on my bill.
I'll pay you later.
Let's get out of here now.
This place always kind of reminds me of a roach motel for airplanes.
They fly in, but they don't fly out.
Sort of like us.
So tell me, who's the happy cop with the gun?
Antunnez.
- Jack, what's the deal?
- Take a look.
Orchids?
Phragmipedium besseae, actually.
Now, Jack, I could be wrong, but Antunnez does not strike me as a flower lover.
Wanna level with me?
I'm kind of tired of being jerked around like a big dog on a short leash.
Let it never be said of Jack Dalton that he was unkind to animals.
Heroin?
You're smuggling heroin?
Of all the stupid, idiotic things, Jack--
I know!
It's not my stuff!
Mac, jeez.
For enough grease, Antunnez will look the other way.
He did for me, and he did for the guy whose heroin this is.
Name is Sonny.
- How'd you end up with it?
- He stashed it in my plants.
Antunnez told him I'd fly it back to the States.
When I found out about it, I told them to take a hike.
That's when they grabbed Mi--
- My botanist.
- Botanist?
I thought there was more than one.
Botanists.
Botanist.
Yeah, I can see how that could be confusing.
Anyway, they thought they could force my hand.
So you took their drugs, ran to me, thinking I'd bail you out.
You're the only real friend I got.
So why didn't you just tell me the whole story?
Right, sure.
Drugs, blackmail, corrupt police.
Sounds like a bad TV show.
- Wanna know how it ends?
- They all live happily ever after?
With me walking out that door and going for help.
Oh, Mac, come on.
Mac.
Mac.
Mac, come on.
What about Mike?
She'll be dead by the time you get the help we need.
Mike?
Mike Forrester?
The Mike in those pictures?
Our Mike?
I could have sworn I told you, Mike's my botanist.
I told you, I'm a botanist.
I don't know where your stuff is.
Okay, come on, babe.
This is getting real old, real fast.
We want our scag.
Okay, okay.
Look, I understand, you might not wanna deal with this dude here.
But me, hey, I'm an American.
Just the same as you.
You're nothing like me.
What kind of an American would buy off a cop?
And let him kick monks out of their own monastery, all for money?
A guy's gotta have some fun.
I've already told you,
I don't know where your drugs are.
And I don't know where Jack is.
I believe her, Sonny.
Finally.
But she has outlived her usefulness.
It ain't a total wipeout.
A pretty babe like her.
I'll bet she's good for something.
Yes, perhaps you're right.
My mother taught me never to strike a lady.
I never listened to my mother.
You told me you hadn't seen her in years.
I don't get you.
Why all these lies?
All you had to do was say that Mike was in trouble.
I'd have come here.
You'd have been mad and left me in L.A.
You don't think I'm mad now?
!
But, Mac, we're here together.
You and me.
We're gonna save Mike.
You know, I wonder if you're even dying, or was that a lie too?
Sorry.
All right, where are they keeping her?
I'm not sure.
But don't worry.
I got a plan.
I'll bet.
That's Elena over there.
She runs the place.
- Which one?
- The one in the red, apron, doorway.
She hears all, sees more and tells little.
Except to moi.
She's a very good friend.
She just might know where he's keeping her.
And we've gotta get past those guys first.
Come on.
Antunnez is inside.
- He's looking for you.
- Don't I know it.
We gotta find Mike.
Do you know where he's keeping her?
I don't know, but I might know somebody who does.
Dalton!
- What?
- Look, let's split up.
- No use both of us getting caught.
- Both of us?
Don't worry.
I've got a plan.
Some plan, Jack.
So Jack wanted to get caught?
What kind of plan is that?
A dumb one.
He probably figured he'd be thrown in with Mike.
Probably also figured I'd go after him too.
Did he also figure you would save them both?
Jack operates a lot on faith.
Any idea why Antunnez threw him in the monastery instead of his jail?
Privacy.
The colonel doesn't like to mix business with pleasure.
Anybody else ever get in?
Except once.
A few weeks ago, the monks had a funeral.
That's where their mausoleum is.
I'm sorry I can't help you more.
Oh, don't worry.
I have a plan.
I can't believe I just said that.
I do and do and do for you guys, and this is the thanks I get?
Oh, go ahead.
Crack wise, sport.
You got one day to tell me where my stuff is, or you're both vapour.
Jack, are you all right?
I haven't felt this good in a long time.
I feel alive.
You look terrible.
Oh, right, well, thanks for the cheer-up, ducky.
Why don't you just tell them where the heroin is?
Because it's wrong.
And it's the only reason we're still alive.
Don't worry.
We're getting out of here.
- lt'll take a miracle.
- We got it.
- MacGyver.
- Here?
You bet.
All I had to say was, "Mike's in trouble," and, bingo, there he was.
- Mac.
- Yeah, all we gotta do is sit tight.
Mac'll get us out.
Does this look bad?
Bad.
Yo, gentlemen.
Eyes front and centre.
I must say, I'm surprised to see you all here.
I was not aware of any recent deaths.
But how rude of me.
Where there is a coffin, there must surely be a body.
Put the coffin down here.
I have interfered enough with this poor soul's journey to his final resting place.
Perhaps I can ensure the dearly departed of a speedy arrival at his final destination.
Now you may bury your dead.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I'd never been one to give much thought to what I wore, but a guy could get attached to this outfit after a while.
Multipurpose clerical wear.
Something useful for every occasion.
Especially for staying out of trouble.
Oh, I got it! "Breast-fed babies are the best-fed babies."
- No.
- No?
Damn.
Then I'd like to buy another vowel, Pat.
- Hi, kids.
- Mac!
- I can't believe you're here.
- That makes two of us.
Hi, baby.
Why is it every time you wish you had your camera, you remember you left it in another country?
Whenever you're ready.
Hey, what's the deal?
You wear pants under those, or what?
No pants?
I think we ought to hightail it out of here, Padre.
- Look.
- What?
- The truck.
- What?
- The truck.
- The truck.
Let's go.
I'm gonna need something to carry a current.
- Here.
- Oh, you guys are good together.
I've put a lot of effort into this, Antunnez.
But it's all a waste of time if Dalton doesn't talk.
But he will talk, or watch the girl die a most unpleasant death.
You guys still need me.
Move it, come on!
Tu, my man, it looks like it's time for another funeral.
Yours.
Don't worry.
There's only one way for them to leave this country:
Their plane.
And I have it covered.
I'd say we hoof it from here.
Jack?
What?
What?
Can't a guy show a little appreciation for his freedom?
Help me up, would you?
- You all right?
- I'm okay.
- You sure?
- I'm sure.
So much for a clean getaway.
Well, it's just as well it worked out this way, I suppose.
- That plane wasn't going anywhere.
- Say what?
Remember, we got hit when we came in?
Lost all that fuel?
Well, I checked the gauges.
Way I figure it, we take off in that plane, one of two things can happen.
One, we can fly about five miles and crash into the mountains.
Or two, we can fly about five miles and crash into the ocean.
Nice to have options.
Oh, you know, Mac, some days are like that.
- Oh, is this great, or what?
- What?
Us.
Together again.
Just like the Monkees.
The good old days.
Remember?
Forgive me for being a wet blanket, but I'd feel a whole lot better if we could take this reunion tour on the road.
Mike, Mike.
Don't worry.
I've got- "l have a plan." - "l have a plan."
- Do I say that a lot?
- Yeah.
Well, I got a plan too.
Come on.
We need the plane, and we need time to fix it.
We need to get Antunnez's men away from it.
Yeah, that's where you come in, son.
Give us half an hour, and then bring Antunnez and Sonny to your junkyard.
And then?
We'll have a little surprise made up for them.
What'll I use for bait?
Tell Antunnez we'll trade his drugs for your plane.
Jack's plane's worthless right now.
You know that, I know that, Jack knows that.
- I like your style.
- Yeah.
- See you later.
- Let's go.
Is that the heroin?
Good, just put it down right there.
Hope Jack doesn't object.
I dug into his private stock of cheap wine.
I don't know, Mac.
I usually use a white wine to charge my dead batteries.
Actually, vinegar works better.
But there's enough acid in this stuff to act as a catalyst, so I think Jack's wine comes close enough.
Come on.
Besides, we only need charge enough to turn this prop a couple of times.
- That's great.
Like a better mousetrap.
- Yeah.
Now what?
Now all we have to do is camouflage the tarpaulin, check the starter here back to the wine battery and cover up the rope with vines.
We need stuff like this.
What's this for?
It's good to see you again, Mike.
How do you guys do it?
Pummel me all night, shoot at me in the morning, steal my plane in the afternoon and still not a hair out of place.
You feel like praying a little?
Take it easy on me, man.
You never gonna see your drugs no more, man.
I don't think that would be a very wise idea.
No more games, Dalton.
No more games?
Then how about a proposition?
All right, here we go.
It's a nice place.
You and the rest of the garbage.
I see you have finally decided to be civil.
How very wise of you.
Enough small talk.
Where's our smack?
It's by the plane.
Let me get it for you.
Not without company.
Let's all go.
Okay.
- Hold it.
- Antunnez!
That's enough.
Antunnez, help.
Get me down from here now!
Antunnez.
Antunnez!
The heroin.
Well, it's not quite that easy.
You'd leave an awful lot of loose ends.
You are drug smugglers.
I am the law.
And you will not be alive to say otherwise.
Now, wait a minute.
I got a plan.
You want the smack, right?
Here's what you do.
Let them go, and you and I boogie with the booty.
- Jack, what are you doing?
- I'll ask the questions.
And what do I need you for, Mr. Dalton?
Because like it or not, if they find our bodies down here, our government's going to make sure your government makes it very hard on you.
Americans are funny that way.
They take care of their own, like family.
That'll make it very difficult for you to move that smack, even if you have it.
- That's where I come in.
- Where you come in?
I've got a plane.
I can fly.
You can't.
You'd be so rich.
Tax-free American dollars.
Power.
And all you gotta do is let them live.
What's that to you?
Touch them, you go nowhere.
- Jack, this is crazy, I can't let--
- Mac.
I got you two into this.
The least I can do is get you out of it.
What do you say, colonel?
Best deal in town.
We have an agreement, Mr. Dalton.
You two, over there.
Tie them up, and let's go.
Jack, what the heck are you doing?
The minute you take off in that plane, you're a dead man.
I meant what I said about family, Mac.
You and Mike are family to me.
You really are dying, aren't you?
We're all dying, Mac.
Some of us are just doing it a little faster than others, that's all.
Jack is that true?
Dalton.
Take care of each other, will you?
- The drugs.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dalton.
Come on, Mike, hurry.
There's no way I'm gonna let him go through with this.
Don't drop it.
Go.
It's been said the best gift a man could ever give another was his life.
Jack Dalton was never one to settle for less than the best.
Thank you, Jack.
I don't know what line Jack used to bring you down to Dinoto, but I'm sure glad it worked.
Actually, it was the truth that clinched it.
You knew Jack was dying.
Yeah.
I wonder why he never told me.
Well, you know Jack.
No time for sympathy.
Yeah, too busy living life.
Searching for that greatest adventure.
Having a lot of fun with his friends.
Yeah, all right, thanks.
Keep me posted, will you?
The Columbian navy picked up Antunnez.
He washed ashore, still holding on to his dope.
At least that should guarantee a conviction.
Well, Antunnez claims he bailed out when he saw both engines smoking.
Says the plane was going down.
He hit the water, went under, and when he came up, there was no sign of the plane.
Or Jack.
Both engines smoking.
Tricks of me trade, me boyo.
Tricks of me trade.
What?
You don't suppose he had a plan?
But Jack said he only had enough fuel for five miles.
Yeah.
And when was the last time
Jack didn't stretch the truth just a little?
Some things in life just aren't fair.
This is one of them.
I suppose I could always call the police.
Or not.
I don't believe this.
Bedroom stripped, closet cleaned out.
"Kidnapped."
A thief with a sense of humour.
"Dear Mac, if you ever want to see your fridge alive, meet me at the west end of the airport, hangar 13.
Come alone, or the fridge fries."
Some folks might see the humour in something like this.
I don't happen to be one.
But I knew someone who would:
Jack Dalton.
I hadn't seen Jack Dalton in almost five years.
He, Mike Forrester and I had been like the Three Musketeers.
After college, we traipsed all over Europe together.
You had to give Jack one thing:
He knew how to have fun.
High-adventure, globe-trotting, no-holds-barred fun.
Tonight it started with looting my apartment.
And this very convenient open door told me it wasn't gonna stop there.
Jack Dalton.
Rogue, adventurer, liar, thief.
And there was living proof.
My hockey jersey.
It was starting to look to me like maybe Jack Dalton had a plan.
Well, so did I.
One might ask how I could be so sure this was the work of Jack Dalton.
Well, sometimes you just know.
Jack.
Come on, I know it's you.
My stuff.
Jack!
MacGyver, I'm flattered.
You came.
I had a choice?
Yo, Mac, where you going?
You're not steamed, are you?
Come on, it was a joke.
First, you're gonna come down here so I can punch you in the nose.
Then you're gonna load up all my stuff and take it back to my place.
You got that?
AII right, I'm sorry.
If that's what you want, I'II put it all back.
- Good.
- Hey, Mac, please, don't go.
Where you going?
Mac!
I'm begging you.
Mac!
Jack!
You should see your face.
Priceless.
Oh, Mac, you haven't changed.
Not a bit.
- Neither have you, Jack.
- Yeah?
Thanks.
It wasn't a compliment.
Hey, Mac, you gotta cut me down.
Mac!
Mac, cut me down!
Come on, MacGyver, my head's about to explode here.
I knew you wouldn't leave me hanging.
You can call me "amigo" anytime.
If there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know, amigo.
Now, easy, easy.
Hey, watch my head!
Just like the tocotines.
In Papantla.
Remember, Mac?
When you and Mike and I were at the festival of Corpus Christi?
always wanted to try that.
- What a rush.
- Jack, what do you want?
Right to the point, huh?
Good.
We can reminisce later.
I wanna talk.
I do have a phone.
At least I used to.
Yeah, but I couldn't be sure you'd come.
I need a favour.
- You know how to butter a guy up.
- Look, I got my own company now.
Jack Dalton, sole proprietor, FIy-by-Night air freight, at your service.
The official airline for slugs, scum and all manner of vermin.
Anyway, I was shall we say, transporting some very valuable orchids.
Shall we say smuggling?
That's an ugly word, Mac.
But, hey, at 1,000 bucks a plant, I can live with it.
Anyway, you know me.
What do I know about orchids?
Maybe how to spell it.
So I needed expert advice.
Botanists.
So where does the favour come in?
A little rescue mission to save the botanists.
- In Dinoto.
- Dinoto?
As in Central America, Dinoto?
- Yeah.
Come on, Mac.
- Yeah.
We can take my plane, be there in no time.
Think about it.
- Adventure.
Danger.
It'II be fun.
- Jack!
What have these botanists done?
Americans are being snatched all over the world, Mac.
I mean, you know how it is with these crazies.
You're lying, Jack.
About what, I don't know, but you're hiding something.
That hurts me, Mac.
How can you say that?
Your eye.
It still twitches when you're lying.
Look, I gotta do it, Mac.
It's my fault they're there.
Mac, please, a favour for a friend.
I'm begging you.
Why should I believe you?
You've never been straight about anything in your whole life.
And whatever happened to that Iooking-out-for-number-one, cut-your-Iosses-and-get-out-quick Jack Dalton we all knew and loved?
- He's changed.
- Yeah.
Wish I could believe that.
I'm dying, Mac.
- What?
- I'm dying.
No joke?
No joke.
And I just wanna do one thing right before I do.
AII I said, Mac, was there was a remote chance that there's an ounce of truth to his story.
That's all.
Our sources do tell us that there's an American botanist in the country.
So you're telling me some botanists are missing?
Mac, what makes you think this isn't one of Jack's lies?
I don't know, Pete.
I think he's telling the truth this time.
Just a feeling.
Well, I don't like it.
The whole thing creaks.
Makes me nervous.
Careful, Pete, you're on a diet.
You know how you like to eat when you're nervous.
Listen, Mac, you know there is no way the Foundation can get involved in this, but if there's anything that I can do unofficially, call me, will you?
Thank you for using the telephone.
Your three minutes are up.
So, what's the deal?
Papa Thornton say you can come out and play?
Yeah.
Good.
Now we go to plane, kemosabe.
You follow.
I know I said I was gonna slug him.
But how do you hit a kid?
Shouldn't we be using charts or something?
Charts.
Shouldn't we be using charts?
What's the name on the plane, Mac?
- FIy-by-Night.
- Exactly.
Now, relax.
I know what I'm doing.
- Charts?
- Strongbox.
Hey, you found the pictures.
Where was that one taken again?
Martinique.
That was just before we went diving off the coral reef.
Oh, right.
That was the day we saw that shark feeding frenzy.
Remember?
Remember?
You started it.
That was the same day I cut my air hose on the coral.
You saved my Iife.
Hey, that's what buddies are for.
What else you got there?
It's you, me and Mike in Barbados.
You, me and Mike in Singapore.
You, me and Mike in Fresno.
- Those were good times.
- Yep.
So you seen Mike any lately?
You always were a Iittle warm for her form.
It's been about four years.
Besides, you were the one that was always proposing to her.
Yeah, and she'd have said yes if she didn't think it'd have broke your heart.
Boy, it'd be great to get together again, just the three of us.
- One last great adventure.
- Yeah.
How about you, Jack?
- You seen Mike lately?
- No.
Been a Iong time.
Long time.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
We'd Iike to thank you for flying FIy-by-Night and welcome you to beautiful Dinoto, where the temperature is a balmy 83 degrees.
please extinguish all smoking materials and bring your seatbacks and tray tables to their full upright position for landing.
Something tells me this isn't the only airport in town.
Customs can be such a bother, old boy.
Here we go, hold on.
You know, I feel good about this.
I didn't wanna say anything last night, but I had my doubts you'd even come.
However, you're here, the sun's up, it's a new day, and all's well on God's green earth.
Yes, indeed.
We'II be in and out in no time with my botanists.
Does anyone know you went for help?
Are you kidding?
I slipped out of here like a thief in the night.
No way anybody knows I was gone.
- You sure?
- Positive.
Capitán, capitán, I hear it.
Looks like you've been missed.
You wanna tell me what's going on?
Oh, my mistake.
Private airstrip.
- Jack, why are the police here?
- I could have sworn I told you.
Those are the guys we have to save the botanists from.
The police?
!
Take it easy, Mac.
I got a plan.
Jack, wouldn't you say we're running out of runway?
You worry too much, Mac.
Sometimes you don't worry enough!
Come on, faster!
Let's get them!
Hang on, Mac, I'm bringing her around.
What was that?
Tricks of me trade, Mac, me boyo.
Tricks of me trade.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna give them a burst of fresh air.
They're gaining on us.
Hang on.
We're turning again.
Beautiful!
Mac, I gotta tell you, it brought tears to my eyes.
Beautiful.
Now, tell me you're not having just a Iittle bit of fun.
Crack shooting, Antunnez.
You got a bunch of real sharpshooters on your force.
Perhaps you'd Iike to test my marksmanship?
That's not just my money winging its way out of here.
No, you and I are like a team, amigo.
- I lose, you lose.
- He will not leave without the girl.
We will get your plants.
And then we will kill Jack Dalton.
Jack, why are we going down?
There's nothing but jungle around here.
I'm gonna put her down right there.
There?
Where's "there"?
I don't see a landing strip.
Neither do I, it's a cow pasture.
But sometimes sacrifices have to be made.
Hold on.
Hold on, now.
Little bump coming.
There we go, another nifty landing, Jack, my boy.
Smooth as a baby's bottom.
Pure as the driven snow.
Jack, would you mind telling me exactly what's going on?
Exactly what's going on is a Iittle difficult.
But I'II give you a fair approximation.
I've got a place near here, a Iittle hideout of sorts.
I Iike to think of it as my summer home.
Your summer home.
Get much company?
You're the first.
- They hit our fuel tank.
- Not to worry.
Someone has to.
Great job.
Put it on my bill.
I'II pay you later.
Let's get out of here now.
This place always kind of reminds me of a roach motel for airplanes.
They fly in, but they don't fly out.
Sort of like us.
So tell me, who's the happy cop with the gun?
Antunnez.
- Jack, what's the deal?
- Take a look.
Orchids?
Phragmipedium besseae, actually.
Now, Jack, I could be wrong, but Antunnez does not strike me as a flower lover.
Wanna level with me?
I'm kind of tired of being jerked around like a big dog on a short leash.
Let it never be said of Jack Dalton that he was unkind to animals.
Heroin?
You're smuggling heroin?
Of all the stupid, idiotic things, Jack--
I know!
It's not my stuff!
Mac, jeez.
For enough grease, Antunnez will look the other way.
He did for me, and he did for the guy whose heroin this is.
Name is Sonny.
- How'd you end up with it?
- He stashed it in my plants.
Antunnez told him I'd fly it back to the States.
When I found out about it, I told them to take a hike.
That's when they grabbed Mi--
- My botanist.
- Botanist?
I thought there was more than one.
Botanists.
Botanist.
Yeah, I can see how that could be confusing.
Anyway, they thought they could force my hand.
So you took their drugs, ran to me, thinking I'd bail you out.
You're the only real friend I got.
So why didn't you just tell me the whole story?
Right, sure.
Drugs, blackmail, corrupt police.
Sounds like a bad TV show.
- Wanna know how it ends?
- They all live happily ever after?
With me walking out that door and going for help.
Oh, Mac, come on.
Mac.
Mac.
Mac, come on.
What about Mike?
She'II be dead by the time you get the help we need.
Mike?
Mike Forrester?
The Mike in those pictures?
Our Mike?
I could have sworn I told you, Mike's my botanist.
I told you, I'm a botanist.
I don't know where your stuff is.
Okay, come on, babe.
This is getting real old, real fast.
We want our scag.
Okay, okay.
Look, I understand, you might not wanna deal with this dude here.
But me, hey, I'm an American.
Just the same as you.
You're nothing like me.
What kind of an American would buy off a cop?
And let him kick monks out of their own monastery, all for money?
A guy's gotta have some fun.
I've already told you,
I don't know where your drugs are.
And I don't know where Jack is.
I believe her, Sonny.
Finally.
But she has outlived her usefulness.
It ain't a total wipeout.
A pretty babe like her.
I'II bet she's good for something.
Yes, perhaps you're right.
My mother taught me never to strike a lady.
I never listened to my mother.
You told me you hadn't seen her in years.
I don't get you.
Why all these lies?
AII you had to do was say that Mike was in trouble.
I'd have come here.
You'd have been mad and left me in L.A.
You don't think I'm mad now?
!
But, Mac, we're here together.
You and me.
We're gonna save Mike.
You know, I wonder if you're even dying, or was that a lie too?
Sorry.
AII right, where are they keeping her?
I'm not sure.
But don't worry.
I got a plan.
I'II bet.
That's EIena over there.
She runs the place.
- Which one?
- The one in the red, apron, doorway.
She hears all, sees more and tells little.
Except to moi.
She's a very good friend.
She just might know where he's keeping her.
And we've gotta get past those guys first.
Come on.
Antunnez is inside.
- He's looking for you.
- Don't I know it.
We gotta find Mike.
Do you know where he's keeping her?
I don't know, but I might know somebody who does.
Dalton!
- What?
- Look, Iet's split up.
- No use both of us getting caught.
- Both of us?
Don't worry.
I've got a plan.
Some plan, Jack.
So Jack wanted to get caught?
What kind of plan is that?
A dumb one.
He probably figured he'd be thrown in with Mike.
Probably also figured I'd go after him too.
Did he also figure you would save them both?
Jack operates a Iot on faith.
Any idea why Antunnez threw him in the monastery instead of his jail?
Privacy.
The colonel doesn't like to mix business with pleasure.
Anybody else ever get in?
Except once.
A few weeks ago, the monks had a funeral.
That's where their mausoleum is.
I'm sorry I can't help you more.
Oh, don't worry.
I have a plan.
I can't believe I just said that.
I do and do and do for you guys, and this is the thanks I get?
Oh, go ahead.
Crack wise, sport.
You got one day to tell me where my stuff is, or you're both vapour.
Jack, are you all right?
I haven't felt this good in a Iong time.
I feel alive.
You look terrible.
Oh, right, well, thanks for the cheer-up, ducky.
Why don't you just tell them where the heroin is?
Because it's wrong.
And it's the only reason we're still alive.
Don't worry.
We're getting out of here.
- It'II take a miracle.
- We got it.
- MacGyver.
- Here?
You bet.
AII I had to say was, "Mike's in trouble," and, bingo, there he was.
- Mac.
- Yeah, all we gotta do is sit tight.
Mac'II get us out.
Does this look bad?
Bad.
Yo, gentlemen.
Eyes front and centre.
I must say, I'm surprised to see you all here.
I was not aware of any recent deaths.
But how rude of me.
Where there is a coffin, there must surely be a body.
Put the coffin down here.
I have interfered enough with this poor soul's journey to his final resting place.
Perhaps I can ensure the dearly departed of a speedy arrival at his final destination.
Now you may bury your dead.
Hey, what are you doing here?
I'd never been one to give much thought to what I wore, but a guy could get attached to this outfit after a while.
Multipurpose clerical wear.
Something useful for every occasion.
Especially for staying out of trouble.
Oh, I got it! "Breast-fed babies are the best-fed babies."
- No.
- No?
Damn.
Then I'd Iike to buy another vowel, Pat.
- Hi, kids.
- Mac!
- I can't believe you're here.
- That makes two of us.
Hi, baby.
Why is it every time you wish you had your camera, you remember you left it in another country?
Whenever you're ready.
Hey, what's the deal?
You wear pants under those, or what?
No pants?
I think we ought to hightail it out of here, Padre.
- Look.
- What?
- The truck.
- What?
- The truck.
- The truck.
Let's go.
I'm gonna need something to carry a current.
- Here.
- Oh, you guys are good together.
I've put a Iot of effort into this, Antunnez.
But it's all a waste of time if Dalton doesn't talk.
But he will talk, or watch the girl die a most unpleasant death.
You guys still need me.
Move it, come on!
Tu, my man, it looks like it's time for another funeral.
Yours.
Don't worry.
There's only one way for them to leave this country:
Their plane.
And I have it covered.
I'd say we hoof it from here.
Jack?
What?
What?
Can't a guy show a Iittle appreciation for his freedom?
Help me up, would you?
- You all right?
- I'm okay.
- You sure?
- I'm sure.
So much for a clean getaway.
Well, it's just as well it worked out this way, I suppose.
- That plane wasn't going anywhere.
- Say what?
Remember, we got hit when we came in?
Lost all that fuel?
Well, I checked the gauges.
Way I figure it, we take off in that plane, one of two things can happen.
One, we can fly about five miles and crash into the mountains.
Or two, we can fly about five miles and crash into the ocean.
Nice to have options.
Oh, you know, Mac, some days are like that.
- Oh, is this great, or what?
- What?
Us.
Together again.
Just like the Monkees.
The good old days.
Remember?
Forgive me for being a wet blanket, but I'd feel a whole lot better if we could take this reunion tour on the road.
Mike, Mike.
Don't worry.
I've got- "I have a plan." - "I have a plan."
- Do I say that a Iot?
- Yeah.
Well, I got a plan too.
Come on.
We need the plane, and we need time to fix it.
We need to get Antunnez's men away from it.
Yeah, that's where you come in, son.
Give us half an hour, and then bring Antunnez and Sonny to your junkyard.
And then?
We'II have a Iittle surprise made up for them.
What'II I use for bait?
Tell Antunnez we'II trade his drugs for your plane.
Jack's plane's worthless right now.
You know that, I know that, Jack knows that.
- I Iike your style.
- Yeah.
- See you later.
- Let's go.
Is that the heroin?
Good, just put it down right there.
Hope Jack doesn't object.
I dug into his private stock of cheap wine.
I don't know, Mac.
I usually use a white wine to charge my dead batteries.
Actually, vinegar works better.
But there's enough acid in this stuff to act as a catalyst, so I think Jack's wine comes close enough.
Come on.
Besides, we only need charge enough to turn this prop a couple of times.
- That's great.
Like a better mousetrap.
- Yeah.
Now what?
Now all we have to do is camouflage the tarpaulin, check the starter here back to the wine battery and cover up the rope with vines.
We need stuff like this.
What's this for?
It's good to see you again, Mike.
How do you guys do it?
Pummel me all night, shoot at me in the morning, steal my plane in the afternoon and still not a hair out of place.
You feel like praying a Iittle?
Take it easy on me, man.
You never gonna see your drugs no more, man.
I don't think that would be a very wise idea.
No more games, Dalton.
No more games?
Then how about a proposition?
AII right, here we go.
It's a nice place.
You and the rest of the garbage.
I see you have finally decided to be civil.
How very wise of you.
Enough small talk.
Where's our smack?
It's by the plane.
Let me get it for you.
Not without company.
Let's all go.
Okay.
- Hold it.
- Antunnez!
That's enough.
Antunnez, help.
Get me down from here now!
Antunnez.
Antunnez!
The heroin.
Well, it's not quite that easy.
You'd leave an awful lot of loose ends.
You are drug smugglers.
I am the Iaw.
And you will not be alive to say otherwise.
Now, wait a minute.
I got a plan.
You want the smack, right?
Here's what you do.
Let them go, and you and I boogie with the booty.
- Jack, what are you doing?
- I'II ask the questions.
And what do I need you for, Mr. Dalton?
Because like it or not, if they find our bodies down here, our government's going to make sure your government makes it very hard on you.
Americans are funny that way.
They take care of their own, Iike family.
That'II make it very difficult for you to move that smack, even if you have it.
- That's where I come in.
- Where you come in?
I've got a plane.
I can fly.
You can't.
You'd be so rich.
Tax-free American dollars.
Power.
And all you gotta do is let them live.
What's that to you?
Touch them, you go nowhere.
- Jack, this is crazy, I can't Iet--
- Mac.
I got you two into this.
The least I can do is get you out of it.
What do you say, colonel?
Best deal in town.
We have an agreement, Mr. Dalton.
You two, over there.
Tie them up, and let's go.
Jack, what the heck are you doing?
The minute you take off in that plane, you're a dead man.
I meant what I said about family, Mac.
You and Mike are family to me.
You really are dying, aren't you?
We're all dying, Mac.
Some of us are just doing it a Iittle faster than others, that's all.
Jack is that true?
Dalton.
Take care of each other, will you?
- The drugs.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dalton.
Come on, Mike, hurry.
There's no way I'm gonna let him go through with this.
Don't drop it.
Go.
It's been said the best gift a man could ever give another was his life.
Jack Dalton was never one to settle for less than the best.
Thank you, Jack.
I don't know what line Jack used to bring you down to Dinoto, but I'm sure glad it worked.
Actually, it was the truth that clinched it.
You knew Jack was dying.
Yeah.
I wonder why he never told me.
Well, you know Jack.
No time for sympathy.
Yeah, too busy living life.
Searching for that greatest adventure.
Having a Iot of fun with his friends.
Yeah, all right, thanks.
Keep me posted, will you?
The Columbian navy picked up Antunnez.
He washed ashore, still holding on to his dope.
At least that should guarantee a conviction.
Well, Antunnez claims he bailed out when he saw both engines smoking.
Says the plane was going down.
He hit the water, went under, and when he came up, there was no sign of the plane.
Or Jack.
Both engines smoking.
Tricks of me trade, me boyo.
Tricks of me trade.
What?
You don't suppose he had a plan?
But Jack said he only had enough fuel for five miles.
Yeah.
And when was the Iast time
Jack didn't stretch the truth just a Iittle?
What's the matter with you Boycie?
You don't seem you're old self tonight, You ain't cheated once.
No, sorry Trigger, I'm just a bit down, that's all.
I mean, you don't know what it's like to have a wife who cannot have children.
I've tried to console her.
I've said 'Marlene, God didn't mean you to have kids, so shut up about it.
'Doesn't seem to help.
I'd like to be someone's dad.
We're down for another going over at the bloody hospital next week.
I mean, embarrassing ain't the word.
I'm sure they do half those tests just for a giggle.
I mean, she's the one with the problem, why have I gotta go?
I never knew who my dad was.
I heard your mum weren't that sure.
You're out of order Mike.
She knew who my dad was...roughly.
Now, come off it Trigger.
I've seen your birth certificate at school!
What did your mum put down under father's name?
...Long time ago weren't it?
What did she put down under father's name?
'Some Soldiers!
' Well maybe that's where I get my military bering from!
Oh yeah?
Well go'n do a counter-attack then!
Where's Del Boy tonight then?
- He's gone to the Zoo.
- He's gone to the...
- Don't ask.
- Right then, I'm off now Mickey.
Yeah, I'll see yer later Amanda.
Here doll, treat yourself to a chinky, yeah.
Cor, cheers Mick.
I'll give you a bell in the week.
Seems like a nice girl Mickey!
Yeah well!
You know how it is Mike, every so often a person fancies a bit of rough!
And she picked you?
Oh that's a joke innit?
I remember you said something funny a couple of years ago!
Alright Mick?
- Alright Rodney, what you having?
- Oh, um, 'alf a lager please, ta.
'Ere y'are Mike, make that a big pint!
Oi, oi, what have you been up to then?
I'm working for Boycie ain't I!
Delivering, picking up.
He's in the video game in a big way.
Pirates, naughties, all that!
And it's cash in hand, no questions, sweet as a nut!
Where you been, out on the knocker?
No, I've just come back from me evening class ain't I?
You know I told you we'd applied for an Arts Council grant?
We got it!
Never!
Yeah, straight up!
Mr Stevens, right, he's head of our art group, got confirmation this morning.
We got ten thousand pounds to make a local community film.
And we've got all the equipment, everything - and guess who's in charge of the project?
You're putting me on!
No, straight up, it's me.
What I've got to do, you see,
I've gotta come up with the idea and then delegate the various responsibilities to all the other students.
Yeah, well put me in won't you?
I'm a member of your art class aren't I?
Oh come off it Mickey, you only came one night - and that's only cos I told you we had a nude model.
Yeah, well I thought it would be a bird.
You've gotta write it Rodney?
Well, you're a natural when it comes to the written word.
I'll never forget that thing you wrote some years back.
What was it called?
The Indictment.
That's it, The Indictment, yeah.
That would have made a terrific book you know.
Why didn't you send it to the publisher?
I'll be perfectly honest with you Mickey.
I couldn't think of a single publisher who could understand what I was saying.
Yeah, it was a bit strange weren't it?
- Alright Rodders?
- Hello Del, what you having?
What am I having?
A bleeding' hard time with this moaner, here.
I shouldn't be humping bales of hay around at my time of life.
Bales of hay?
You see, Abdul's cousin's girlfriend's brother's mate, right, he's a gamekeeper down at one of these private Zoos!
And Monkey Harris's sister's husband's first wife's stepfather, right, he works for an animal food company.
So, put the two together and what you got - a nice little earner.
Don't wanna worry you but I think you've got something nesting in there, old son.
Up yer shirt!
Hang on.
I'll see you in a minute.
While you've been poncing around at yer soppy art class I've had to unload two tons of hay!
Oh, poncing around, is that what you call it?
Well, for your information, this evening I was commissioned to make a film!
Leave it out Dave, I wouldn't leave you to make a jelly!
I have heard rumours Mickey Mouse wears a Rodney Trotter wristwatch!
- It's true.
- I love it, Boycie.
I'm telling you!
I've got all the equipment, and everything!
I'm writing it and...and Mickey Pearce is directing!
You what...
Mickey Pearce directing.
He couldn't direct a sea gull to the coast him.
He's got experience in films!
What, that Saturday-morning job at the photographic counter at Boots?
Leave it out Rodney.
Anyway, you couldn't write a film script.
I mean, what was that book that you wrote, what was it called The Indikment,
I mean that never got published did it, eh?
No, 'cos you chucked it down the bloody chute!
Yes that's right, because I didn't want to see you disappointed!
It was a bloody stupid story - no murders in it or nothing!
It was an indictment of a failing system weren't it?
Alright, it was a first effort so it probably didn't have the same social impact as, say, Cathy Come Home!
It didn't have the same social impact as Lassie Come Home!
This film you're making Rodney - anyone in it we know?
I tell you what, all them birds are in it for a start, look.
That's a shred move on your part Rodney.
You're the writer, Mickey's the director.
So he gets the casting couch and you get the Biro!
'Ey up there, here you are Oscar, quick, mind out - I've got a present for you.
There y'are.
- What is it?
- Close your eyes.
- Oh come on Del!
- Now, come on, close yer eyes!
I bet Tom Stoppard don't have to put up with all this!
Alright, come on then open 'em.
Well?
There you are.
It's a typewriter, innit?
You see that Albert, he recognised it straight away, that's the author in him!
Well, come on Rodney, come on, let's get going boy.
You'll soon have that old screenplay knocked out now won't you my son?
Go on, there.
It's er...it's old isn't it?
They made stuff to last in them days.
That is quality Rodney.
Look at that crest, by royal appointment.
- Oh yeah...
Victoria Regina!
- Well go'n.
- What?
- Well go on, try it.
It's very faint Del, innit?
Well you gotta hit it harder than that Rodney - have another go.
It's still faint.
Well, you've gotta give it a good whack haven't ya.
Here, I'll show ya, look.
There y'are, there y'are, that's a bit better, look.
Yeah that's great, thanks a lot.
- Away you go then.
- Away I go what?
Well, you know, you know, start the old typing.
Yeah, be creative.
Be creat...
I can't just be creative at the drop of a hat can I?
There are certain things a writer needs before he can actually start writing.
Like a story!
You ain't even got a story?
Not exactly, I've only been trying for a couple of days, ain't I?
Listen, I've got an idea for a story and it's a bloody good 'un an' all!
D'you wanna hear it?
No...
Not really Del.
Oh that's charming innit?
You buy him a brand-new typewriter and come up with a story for him, and what thanks d'you get?
I'll tell you what thanks get Albert, no sodding thanks, that's the thanks I get!
Alright, tell me yer story then!
No, no, don't bother yourself Rodney, please.
I was only tryin' to help you!
Oh now, come on, honestly Del, seriously, I'd like to hear your story...
Well, I need a bit of help, don't I?
Right, okay, now this is a Jaws-type story.
Jaws?
Jaws has been done though.
I know it's been done!
But this is different.
It's called...
There's a Rhino Loose in the City!
There's a Rhi...
Loose In...
As in rhinoceros?
That's right.
There's a Rhino Loose in the City!
What's it about Del?
Well, it's about this rhinoceros right, escapes from the zoo and it heads straight for London!
And after two or three days they find like all these dead bodies lying about and no-one knows who's done it!
So, they get hold of this private detective, you know, like a sort of Charlton Heston type geezer to try and solve the crime.
Now the zoo keeper happens to be a very attractive woman.
Before you know where you are, old Charlton is giving the sort what for, so that's yer romantic interest!
A rhinoceros?
Yeah!
But they don't know it's missing!
But how can you not know?
If you've got a rhinoceros right and one day it ain't there - well, you tend to know it's missing!
Don't be a plonker all yer life Rodney.
She ain't got one rhinoceros, she probably had two or three rhinoceroses!
And how's he escape?
Squeezed through the bars most probably!
Now don't you start getting saucy with me Rodney.
I'm only trying to help you.
I don't believe this!
Nobody knows it's escaped?
What about the eight million people living in London?
Don't none of them spot it?
Yes!
But the ones who spot it - they're the ones who get trampled to death!
And what about all the others?
The people in offices, the people in cafes, the people sitting on top of buses!
It's a rhino Del.
- He only comes out at night!
- What is it, a vampire rhino?
No it is not a vampire rhino.
That is stupid that is, innit eh?
And where does he live during the day?
In a lock-up garage in a back street!
What, he's leasing it is he?
He's not leasing it.
It's a disused garage in a back street where no one ever goes!
The detective does find it, only it's at night!
And the rhino's gone out?
That's right see, so you see the old detective is nowhere near solving the mystery.
You see what it is Rodney, not only is it a love story!
It's a whodunit!
An whodunit?
What do you mean an whodunit?
We know who-dun-it!
The rhino done it!
Yes, I know that, we - we the audience know that, but they don't know - the actors do they?
This is something!
A rhinoceros has escaped from a zoo!
There are 300 dead bodies covered in rhinoceros footprints!
There's a lockup garage two and 'arf foot deep in rhinoceros crap and Charlton Heston suspects the butler!
I do admit there are one or two teething snags!
But it's got all the essential qualities of a hit hasn't it.
I mean, it's got suspense, lots of killings and a bit of humpty dumpty!
I mean, look, this is a disaster movie!
Disaster?
It's a calamity Del!
Why is he killing people?
Well, what d'you want him to be a social worker?
Well, he's a man-eater ain't he?
No, no, rhinoceroses aren't carnivorous!
They're vegetarian!
Alright, so we elbow the lock-up garage and we make him hide in the back of an health food shop!
And he won't head for the city neither.
But he's gotta head for the city so that he can kill lots of people!
Yeah that's right!
No, his natural habitat would be open country.
Alright, so what are you suggesting?
We call the film There's a Rhino Loose Somewhere Out in the Sticks Where No Sod Lives?
You don't call the likes of Charlton Heston in 'cos something's eating carrots!
I think it's a good idea Del.
- Thank you very much Albert.
- Yeah, well I'll pass!
Alright, alright, I just wanted to put an idea in your head that was all.
I wish it'd been a bleedin' bullet now!
Del, I've only got a small budget, ain't I?
But that's the beauty of it Rodney.
I know where there's a rhinoceros going cheap!
Yeah, alright Chas, I'll knock out that stuff for you tomorrow night.
Eh?
Um, not sure whether we'll be wanting the rhino now.
We won't.
Alright, listen I'll give you a bell tomorrow Chas.
Tata mate.
Oi Tony, come on, where's that grub - we've been waiting 'alf hour.
There's something I wanted to catch on the telly, the Epilogue.
Wha' you order?
Look I told you, two chicken and rice and one Spanish omelette.
Two chicken rice, one Spanish omerette.
Can't even speak the lingo can he?
Well, how are you getting on with your story then?
Well I have the kernel of an idea!
I'm just waiting for it to develop somewhat.
It's what writers call the gestation period.
- And what do you call it?
- Stop it, stop your winding up you.
And where's your director then Rodney?
He's acquainting himself with the video camera and all the equipment.
Yeah.
He's down the Town Hall filming a wedding.
What d'you mean he's down the Town Hall filming a wedding?
Well, well you see what happened was, I went down the Town Hall and around a few churches taking notes of the banns.
Then I contacted the brides and asked them if they'd like their happiest day recorded on film for 50 quid a throw!
I don't believe you're doing this to me!
Well look Rodney, that Mickey Pearce has gotta practice with that camera ain't he?
He's gotta work out how to focus it and all that.
You know, why not earn while yer learn!
That's what I say.
Anyway, Boycie nicks all them tapes from Boycie, don't he, eh?
But Del, this is an opportunity for me and all you're doing is making money out of it!
It'll be alright because he's only got five or six weddings to do, two or three christenings and he's finished.
But that camera is council property!
- Yeah, so is the Town Hall.
- Yeah see, there you go!
You're just abusing the trust shown in me, ain't yer.
Iwill you shut up you tart!
Look, here is your share.
I don't want it.
Oh well, please yourself.
It goes back in the...
Alright, just this once!
Don't do me no favours Rodney!
Will ya, eh?
You've got a nerve...
Well, that's shut you up for a good while though innit Boycie!
I keep telling you Marlene, them doctors don't know everything!
They're a bunch of chancers that's all.
Good afternoon, I phoned an order through earlier, Mr Boyce.
- Oh yes, I go see.
- Thank you.
All those bloody tests I've had!
And what about all the bloody tests I've...
Oh, good afternoon Derek.
I didn't realise you and your family were dining out.
Oh yes, I like to treat 'em once in a while, keep the moral up.
Hello darling, how are you?
Hey, is my little godson in there yet?
No he ain't!
And he ain't likely to be with him around!
Marlene bloody nuffing!
All these years you've said it was my fault we couldn't have kids!
They've just discovered there's nothing wrong with me - it's him.
Ain't it bleeding' fair eh?
What's the matter then Boycie?
You ain't a noofter are you?
See that you've started now Marlene?
Even the doctors ain't allowed to discuss this outside the confines of the laboratory.
And you're holding a public debate in a Chinese take-away.
He's got what the doctors call a low count.
Don't want to buy a calculator do you Boyce?
- What's it mean?
- Nothing!
It means he's been firing more blanks than the Territorials!
You happy now Marlene?
- My Boyce, prawn balls?
- Yes thank...
Yes, thank you very much.
It's our anniversary next Friday. 20 years, Gawd, that's something to celebrate innit?
Anyway, we've hired the pub and you're all invited.
Oh lovely, we'll be there sweetheart.
Well, come along then Marlene.
Yeah alright, oh Rodney is that right you're making a film?
You know I used to act a bit when I was younger.
Actually someone once said that I had a promising career in films.
Yeah, then talkies come along and ruined it!
Let's go Marlene!
Tara Marlene.
Bye bye Boycie.
What about that then?
Old Boycie being a Jaffa.
- A Jaffa?
- Yeah, you know, seedless!
I could use Boycie's problem as a theme for my film couldn't I.
Because that hospital they attend, that's one of the leading centres for genetic research, artificial insemination and all that.
That's quite interesting?
Oh yeah, on the edge of yer seat stuff that - yeah.
Have you thought any more about the rhino story?
Del, I am not doing a film about a blood-sucking rhinoceros and a divvy detective!
No, that hospital interests me though.
I don't reckon they should be allowed to do it - freezing things and all that.
They're messing around with nature.
No, they're not messing around with nature are they?
They're assisting nature!
See, 'cos they only freeze the ova, or eggs, right, until they are ready to be fertilised, right, and then thy get the egg and well they sort of mix...
There's this geezer...
Oi, oi, I've ordered an omelette 'ere.
Yeah, yeah.
Do you know what I reckon, in a few years time, young married couples wanting to start a family, they won't go to the doctors, they'll nip down the road to Bejams!
- Everything alright Rodney?
- No, the T and the A are missing.
Well it's no problem is it?
Well it is if you wanna write words like 'at'!
You'll find a way round it, I've got faith in you, I really have.
Anyway, how are you coming on?
Can I have a read, or something?
No you can't!
It's not finished yet!
Oh alright.
What's this, just a minute.
What's this red mark up here, is that something technical is it?
No, one of my fingers started bleeding!
Never mind, you'll be alright.
Hey!
I tell you what, your movie ain't 'alf caused a stir round here!
You'd be surprised how many actors and actresses live locally.
I don't mean - you know, like professionals, I mean a lot of new, fresh, untapped talent!
Well, I made a list for yer, there you are.
You're not suggesting I use all these people in my film?
Just extras Rodney, just extras.
Never mind the quantity think about the quality!
I'm thinking about the money Del!
I did say, well a tenner a day.
I can't afford to pay 'em a tenner a day!
No, they pay us a tenner a day.
You're just exploiting people again ain't yer?
No I am not Rodney.
I've given 'em your word now.
Well you had no right to!
Alright here's your share.
There you go, look.
And they're just extras?
Just extras, that's all.
By the way, there's a list here of local businesses you might like to mention.
The Seventh Heaven Sauna Parlour?
Yeah, just a mention, something like 'The nice relaxing atmospheric, nice and friendly service.'
You know what I mean?
Oh, is the undertaker's down there?
- No.
- Oh well bear it in mind, will yer?
Del, why are you doing this to me?
I had high hopes when I started this project!
Mr Stevens said if it was good enough he'd show it at the National Film Theatre.
What's the matter with you, you're earning ain't yer?
Look, listen I've gotta shoot, I've got another client to meet.
It might mean another booking...
'Ere, talking about that...what is a 'natural birth'?
Never mind
- I'll find out myself.
Albert, d'you wanna lift?
Yeah, I'll be with you in a minute son.
Well come on, come on shift yourself I ain't got all night you know.
See you later.
Smile, you're on Candid Camera.
Alright, listen, I might have another booking for you later on.
I'll give you a bell, alright.
Alright Rodney?
No it's not alright!
This is getting out of hand!
Look!
What is it, a petition?
No, that's our cast list!
And this is a list of all the shops and businesses we've gotta advertise.
- He forgot the undertakers!
- You mean you knew about it?
Well it's good business Rodney!
Right, I'm off out now Rodney.
- I'll get it.
- Look it's gotta stop Mickey!
We're promoting shops and businesses, ain't we?
We've got more extras than Ben Hur there.
- Watcha babe.
This is Amanda.
- It's a what?
Amanda.
I'm taking her out for a drink tonight so I asked her round here so you could make her a nice cup of coffee.
Alright Rodney.
Yeah, okay.
- D'you take sugar?
- Two please.
Mickey, could I have a moment of your time please.
What's up?
Why is she wearing a nurse's uniform?
She's just come off duty!
Oh yeah.
You must think I've just come off a banana boat!
What are yer playing at?
Look, I've been delivering these films for Boycie ain't I, so I know where I can sell 'em.
We've got all this equipment, why waste it?
We can cut the middle-man out!
I'd like to cut your liver out.
You are not making any films in this flat.
Understand?
Both of you?
Alright Rodney, no need to get out yer pram about it.
Sit down.
I'll make you a cup of coffee then you can both hit the road.
What's happening?
What the bloody hell's happening?
I've got a cast of thousands, I've got more advertising than Pearl and Dean and now Mickey wants to make Emmanuelle in Peckham.
Oh, this is a bloody nightmare...
Now Rodney, Rodney...
Calm down...
Deep breaths...
Nice 'n' easy does it...
- Night Nurse Take One.
- Night Nurse Take One?
That's the way baby.
Let it slip to the ground.
Mickey...
You better not be doing...
Oh no Mickey.
No, get her to put 'em back!
Oh bloody hell!
Hold 'em up.
That's it.
Move 'em about a bit.
Oh hurry up Mickey love.
Boycie, he don't like smiling for too long.
Okay everybody, that's a wrap.
I wasn't ready for that one.
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary dear.
Oi, vicar get a move on.
We've got that christening to do in 20 minutes.
Yes, I'll be with you in just a moment Mickey.
Alright, I'll wait for you down the church then.
Alright Rodney?
- Shut up!
- Please yerself!
Here we go Rodney, my son, there is your share, alright?
I don't like this Del, you know I don't like this.
Ta.
Here Del, we're slipping out to the back room.
- Alright?
- Right, good Mike, yeah.
- Hi Rodney.
- Alright Mike.
Of all the bars in all the world and you had to walk into mine.
You in my film as well Mike are yer?
Yeah, just a little cameo role son.
I'll see you in a minute.
Come on Rodney.
Come on Albert.
It all seems to be going rather well.
Oh yeah, it's very nice innit vicar?
I married the happy couple all those years ago.
Of course, I had hoped by now that the Good Lord would have blessed their union with an offspring or two.
But if it's not to be...
Well I heard that because of the precarious state of the world,
Boycie and Marlene had decided against starting a family.
Oh really?
I heard that Boycie was a Jaffa.
Tell me, is it true that you're making a film Rodney?
Oh yeah.
We got an Arts Council grant.
I er...
I was talking with Derek earlier...
I'll give you a bell when we start shooting vicar.
Thank you my boy.
Alright - everyone got a drink have they?
Even the vicar's in on it Del.
- What you want to drink?
- Give us a beer.
Here.
Go on then my son.
- Watcha Dave.
- Alright Trigger.
- You dirty rat!
- Oh, this is getting bloody stupid.
Alright gentlemen, would you like to settle down.
If you'd like to take your seats.
Come on, here we go.
The Boycie Video and Leisure Arts Company is proud to present the British Premiere of Night Nurse from the novel by Enid Blyton.
Ooh, that was a bit unexpected innit?
Here look at that one.
I've got no sympathy for her, look.
No, no, Del that's gotta be special effects.
No that's real.
No stop - it's starting proper now.
Where do they get these grotty flats to film in?
'Ere I've seen that bird before somewhere.
Go on girl, let's have a look.
'Oh dear, I am tired I've just come back from nursing.'
One of those would do me a week.
Hello, who's got her ear muffs off now...
It was nothing to do with me Del.
It was a Mickey Pearce production!
Mickey Pearce.
You wait till I get my hands on him.
I'm 'gonna shove that camera 'alf a mile up his nostril!
Rodney, didn't you have any idea what you were getting yourself into?
I thought Boycie wouldn't be too pleased you know, someone muscling in on his business and that.
God.
Boycie.
Boycie's not the one that worries me.
It's his partners that are giving me grief.
D'you know who's backing him in this, only the Driscoll Brothers that's all.
- Have you heard of 'em?
- No.
No.
Well let's hope they haven't heard of you.
Now I'm gonna see if I can save your knees and make sure they stay in the same place.
Now I'm stuffing this down the khazi, you stay there.
Del, I promise nothing like this will ever happen again
- I promise.
Hello Rodney?
Alright for a cup of coffee?
- Oh yes, do come in Mickey.
- I brought a few friends with me.
Oh yes.
Pearcie!
I want a ruddy word with you.
Hello?
Oh Mr Stevens, hi!
Yeah, yeah and have you had a chance to read it?
Great.
Well what do you think?
And please be truthfully blunt with me.
Okay, yes, ah ha!
Yes well that's truthfully blunt innit Mr Stevens.
Yes, there are a lot of characters in it, yes, but all vital to the theme I thought.
Yes, well, I actually wanted to write a film that not only dealt with the contemporary issues but also challenged some of the more widely held beliefs of modern youth!
No, that is no problem because my brother knows where he can get us a rhino, yeah!
What's the matter with you Boycie?
You don't seem you're old self tonight, You ain't cheated once.
No, sorry Trigger, I'm just a bit down, that's all.
I mean, you don't know what it's like to have a wife who cannot have children.
I've tried to console her.
I've said 'Marlene, God didn't mean you to have kids, so shut up about it.
'Doesn't seem to help.
I'd like to be someone's dad.
We're down for another going over at the bloody hospital next week.
I mean, embarrassing ain't the word.
I'm sure they do half those tests just for a giggle.
I mean, she's the one with the problem, why have I gotta go?
I never knew who my dad was.
I heard your mum weren't that sure.
You're out of order Mike.
She knew who my dad was...roughly.
Now, come off it Trigger.
I've seen your birth certificate at school!
What did your mum put down under father's name?
...Long time ago weren't it?
What did she put down under father's name?
'Some Soldiers!
' Well maybe that's where I get my military bering from!
Oh yeah?
Well go'n do a counter-attack then!
Where's Del Boy tonight then?
- He's gone to the Zoo.
- He's gone to the...
- Don't ask.
- Right then, I'm off now Mickey.
Yeah, I'll see yer later Amanda.
Here doll, treat yourself to a chinky, yeah.
Cor, cheers Mick.
I'll give you a bell in the week.
Seems like a nice girl Mickey!
Yeah well!
You know how it is Mike, every so often a person fancies a bit of rough!
And she picked you?
Oh that's a joke innit?
I remember you said something funny a couple of years ago!
Alright Mick?
- Alright Rodney, what you having?
- Oh, um, 'alf a lager please, ta.
'Ere y'are Mike, make that a big pint!
Oi, oi, what have you been up to then?
I'm working for Boycie ain't I!
Delivering, picking up.
He's in the video game in a big way.
Pirates, naughties, all that!
And it's cash in hand, no questions, sweet as a nut!
Where you been, out on the knocker?
No, I've just come back from me evening class ain't I?
You know I told you we'd applied for an Arts Council grant?
We got it!
Never!
Yeah, straight up!
Mr Stevens, right, he's head of our art group, got confirmation this morning.
We got ten thousand pounds to make a local community film.
And we've got all the equipment, everything - and guess who's in charge of the project?
You're putting me on!
No, straight up, it's me.
What I've got to do, you see,
I've gotta come up with the idea and then delegate the various responsibilities to all the other students.
Yeah, well put me in won't you?
I'm a member of your art class aren't I?
Oh come off it Mickey, you only came one night - and that's only cos I told you we had a nude model.
Yeah, well I thought it would be a bird.
You've gotta write it Rodney?
Well, you're a natural when it comes to the written word.
I'll never forget that thing you wrote some years back.
What was it called?
The Indictment.
That's it, The Indictment, yeah.
That would have made a terrific book you know.
Why didn't you send it to the publisher?
I'll be perfectly honest with you Mickey.
I couldn't think of a single publisher who could understand what I was saying.
Yeah, it was a bit strange weren't it?
- Alright Rodders?
- Hello Del, what you having?
What am I having?
A bleeding' hard time with this moaner, here.
I shouldn't be humping bales of hay around at my time of life.
Bales of hay?
You see, Abdul's cousin's girlfriend's brother's mate, right, he's a gamekeeper down at one of these private Zoos!
And Monkey Harris's sister's husband's first wife's stepfather, right, he works for an animal food company.
So, put the two together and what you got - a nice little earner.
Don't wanna worry you but I think you've got something nesting in there, old son.
Up yer shirt!
Hang on.
I'll see you in a minute.
While you've been poncing around at yer soppy art class I've had to unload two tons of hay!
Oh, poncing around, is that what you call it?
Well, for your information, this evening I was commissioned to make a film!
Leave it out Dave, I wouldn't leave you to make a jelly!
I have heard rumours Mickey Mouse wears a Rodney Trotter wristwatch!
- It's true.
- I love it, Boycie.
I'm telling you!
I've got all the equipment, and everything!
I'm writing it and...and Mickey Pearce is directing!
You what...
Mickey Pearce directing.
He couldn't direct a sea gull to the coast him.
He's got experience in films!
What, that Saturday-morning job at the photographic counter at Boots?
Leave it out Rodney.
Anyway, you couldn't write a film script.
I mean, what was that book that you wrote, what was it called The Indikment,
I mean that never got published did it, eh?
No, 'cos you chucked it down the bloody chute!
Yes that's right, because I didn't want to see you disappointed!
It was a bloody stupid story - no murders in it or nothing!
It was an indictment of a failing system weren't it?
Alright, it was a first effort so it probably didn't have the same social impact as, say, Cathy Come Home!
It didn't have the same social impact as Lassie Come Home!
This film you're making Rodney - anyone in it we know?
I tell you what, all them birds are in it for a start, look.
That's a shred move on your part Rodney.
You're the writer, Mickey's the director.
So he gets the casting couch and you get the Biro!
'Ey up there, here you are Oscar, quick, mind out - I've got a present for you.
There y'are.
- What is it?
- Close your eyes.
- Oh come on Del!
- Now, come on, close yer eyes!
I bet Tom Stoppard don't have to put up with all this!
Alright, come on then open 'em.
Well?
There you are.
It's a typewriter, innit?
You see that Albert, he recognised it straight away, that's the author in him!
Well, come on Rodney, come on, let's get going boy.
You'll soon have that old screenplay knocked out now won't you my son?
Go on, there.
It's er...it's old isn't it?
They made stuff to last in them days.
That is quality Rodney.
Look at that crest, by royal appointment.
- Oh yeah...
Victoria Regina!
- Well go'n.
- What?
- Well go on, try it.
It's very faint Del, innit?
Well you gotta hit it harder than that Rodney - have another go.
It's still faint.
Well, you've gotta give it a good whack haven't ya.
Here, I'll show ya, look.
There y'are, there y'are, that's a bit better, look.
Yeah that's great, thanks a lot.
- Away you go then.
- Away I go what?
Well, you know, you know, start the old typing.
Yeah, be creative.
Be creat...
I can't just be creative at the drop of a hat can I?
There are certain things a writer needs before he can actually start writing.
Like a story!
You ain't even got a story?
Not exactly, I've only been trying for a couple of days, ain't I?
Listen, I've got an idea for a story and it's a bloody good 'un an' all!
D'you wanna hear it?
No...
Not really Del.
Oh that's charming innit?
You buy him a brand-new typewriter and come up with a story for him, and what thanks d'you get?
I'll tell you what thanks get Albert, no sodding thanks, that's the thanks I get!
Alright, tell me yer story then!
No, no, don't bother yourself Rodney, please.
I was only tryin' to help you!
Oh now, come on, honestly Del, seriously, I'd like to hear your story...
Well, I need a bit of help, don't I?
Right, okay, now this is a Jaws-type story.
Jaws?
Jaws has been done though.
I know it's been done!
But this is different.
It's called...
There's a Rhino Loose in the City!
There's a Rhi...
Loose In...
As in rhinoceros?
That's right.
There's a Rhino Loose in the City!
What's it about Del?
Well, it's about this rhinoceros right, escapes from the zoo and it heads straight for London!
And after two or three days they find like all these dead bodies lying about and no-one knows who's done it!
So, they get hold of this private detective, you know, like a sort of Charlton Heston type geezer to try and solve the crime.
Now the zoo keeper happens to be a very attractive woman.
Before you know where you are, old Charlton is giving the sort what for, so that's yer romantic interest!
A rhinoceros?
Yeah!
But they don't know it's missing!
But how can you not know?
If you've got a rhinoceros right and one day it ain't there - well, you tend to know it's missing!
Don't be a plonker all yer life Rodney.
She ain't got one rhinoceros, she probably had two or three rhinoceroses!
And how's he escape?
Squeezed through the bars most probably!
Now don't you start getting saucy with me Rodney.
I'm only trying to help you.
I don't believe this!
Nobody knows it's escaped?
What about the eight million people living in London?
Don't none of them spot it?
Yes!
But the ones who spot it - they're the ones who get trampled to death!
And what about all the others?
The people in offices, the people in cafes, the people sitting on top of buses!
It's a rhino Del.
- He only comes out at night!
- What is it, a vampire rhino?
No it is not a vampire rhino.
That is stupid that is, innit eh?
And where does he live during the day?
In a lock-up garage in a back street!
What, he's leasing it is he?
He's not leasing it.
It's a disused garage in a back street where no one ever goes!
The detective does find it, only it's at night!
And the rhino's gone out?
That's right see, so you see the old detective is nowhere near solving the mystery.
You see what it is Rodney, not only is it a love story!
It's a whodunit!
An whodunit?
What do you mean an whodunit?
We know who-dun-it!
The rhino done it!
Yes, I know that, we - we the audience know that, but they don't know - the actors do they?
This is something!
A rhinoceros has escaped from a zoo!
There are 300 dead bodies covered in rhinoceros footprints!
There's a lockup garage two and 'arf foot deep in rhinoceros crap and Charlton Heston suspects the butler!
I do admit there are one or two teething snags!
But it's got all the essential qualities of a hit hasn't it.
I mean, it's got suspense, lots of killings and a bit of humpty dumpty!
I mean, look, this is a disaster movie!
Disaster?
It's a calamity Del!
Why is he killing people?
Well, what d'you want him to be a social worker?
Well, he's a man-eater ain't he?
No, no, rhinoceroses aren't carnivorous!
They're vegetarian!
Alright, so we elbow the lock-up garage and we make him hide in the back of an health food shop!
And he won't head for the city neither.
But he's gotta head for the city so that he can kill lots of people!
Yeah that's right!
No, his natural habitat would be open country.
Alright, so what are you suggesting?
We call the film There's a Rhino Loose Somewhere Out in the Sticks Where No Sod Lives?
You don't call the likes of Charlton Heston in 'cos something's eating carrots!
I think it's a good idea Del.
- Thank you very much Albert.
- Yeah, well I'll pass!
Alright, alright, I just wanted to put an idea in your head that was all.
I wish it'd been a bleedin' bullet now!
Del, I've only got a small budget, ain't I?
But that's the beauty of it Rodney.
I know where there's a rhinoceros going cheap!
Yeah, alright Chas, I'll knock out that stuff for you tomorrow night.
Eh?
Um, not sure whether we'll be wanting the rhino now.
We won't.
Alright, listen I'll give you a bell tomorrow Chas.
Tata mate.
Oi Tony, come on, where's that grub - we've been waiting 'alf hour.
There's something I wanted to catch on the telly, the Epilogue.
Wha' you order?
Look I told you, two chicken and rice and one Spanish omelette.
Two chicken rice, one Spanish omerette.
Can't even speak the lingo can he?
Well, how are you getting on with your story then?
Well I have the kernel of an idea!
I'm just waiting for it to develop somewhat.
It's what writers call the gestation period.
- And what do you call it?
- Stop it, stop your winding up you.
And where's your director then Rodney?
He's acquainting himself with the video camera and all the equipment.
Yeah.
He's down the Town Hall filming a wedding.
What d'you mean he's down the Town Hall filming a wedding?
Well, well you see what happened was, I went down the Town Hall and around a few churches taking notes of the banns.
Then I contacted the brides and asked them if they'd like their happiest day recorded on film for 50 quid a throw!
I don't believe you're doing this to me!
Well look Rodney, that Mickey Pearce has gotta practice with that camera ain't he?
He's gotta work out how to focus it and all that.
You know, why not earn while yer learn!
That's what I say.
Anyway, Boycie nicks all them tapes from Boycie, don't he, eh?
But Del, this is an opportunity for me and all you're doing is making money out of it!
It'll be alright because he's only got five or six weddings to do, two or three christenings and he's finished.
But that camera is council property!
- Yeah, so is the Town Hall.
- Yeah see, there you go!
You're just abusing the trust shown in me, ain't yer.
Iwill you shut up you tart!
Look, here is your share.
I don't want it.
Oh well, please yourself.
It goes back in the...
Alright, just this once!
Don't do me no favours Rodney!
Will ya, eh?
You've got a nerve...
Well, that's shut you up for a good while though innit Boycie!
I keep telling you Marlene, them doctors don't know everything!
They're a bunch of chancers that's all.
Good afternoon, I phoned an order through earlier, Mr Boyce.
- Oh yes, I go see.
- Thank you.
All those bloody tests I've had!
And what about all the bloody tests I've...
Oh, good afternoon Derek.
I didn't realise you and your family were dining out.
Oh yes, I like to treat 'em once in a while, keep the moral up.
Hello darling, how are you?
Hey, is my little godson in there yet?
No he ain't!
And he ain't likely to be with him around!
Marlene bloody nuffing!
All these years you've said it was my fault we couldn't have kids!
They've just discovered there's nothing wrong with me - it's him.
Ain't it bleeding' fair eh?
What's the matter then Boycie?
You ain't a noofter are you?
See that you've started now Marlene?
Even the doctors ain't allowed to discuss this outside the confines of the laboratory.
And you're holding a public debate in a Chinese take-away.
He's got what the doctors call a low count.
Don't want to buy a calculator do you Boyce?
- What's it mean?
- Nothing!
It means he's been firing more blanks than the Territorials!
You happy now Marlene?
- My Boyce, prawn balls?
- Yes thank...
Yes, thank you very much.
It's our anniversary next Friday. 20 years, Gawd, that's something to celebrate innit?
Anyway, we've hired the pub and you're all invited.
Oh lovely, we'll be there sweetheart.
Well, come along then Marlene.
Yeah alright, oh Rodney is that right you're making a film?
You know I used to act a bit when I was younger.
Actually someone once said that I had a promising career in films.
Yeah, then talkies come along and ruined it!
Let's go Marlene!
Tara Marlene.
Bye bye Boycie.
What about that then?
Old Boycie being a Jaffa.
- A Jaffa?
- Yeah, you know, seedless!
I could use Boycie's problem as a theme for my film couldn't I.
Because that hospital they attend, that's one of the leading centres for genetic research, artificial insemination and all that.
That's quite interesting?
Oh yeah, on the edge of yer seat stuff that - yeah.
Have you thought any more about the rhino story?
Del, I am not doing a film about a blood-sucking rhinoceros and a divvy detective!
No, that hospital interests me though.
I don't reckon they should be allowed to do it - freezing things and all that.
They're messing around with nature.
No, they're not messing around with nature are they?
They're assisting nature!
See, 'cos they only freeze the ova, or eggs, right, until they are ready to be fertilised, right, and then thy get the egg and well they sort of mix...
There's this geezer...
Oi, oi, I've ordered an omelette 'ere.
Yeah, yeah.
Do you know what I reckon, in a few years time, young married couples wanting to start a family, they won't go to the doctors, they'll nip down the road to Bejams!
- Everything alright Rodney?
- No, the T and the A are missing.
Well it's no problem is it?
Well it is if you wanna write words like 'at'!
You'll find a way round it, I've got faith in you, I really have.
Anyway, how are you coming on?
Can I have a read, or something?
No you can't!
It's not finished yet!
Oh alright.
What's this, just a minute.
What's this red mark up here, is that something technical is it?
No, one of my fingers started bleeding!
Never mind, you'll be alright.
Hey!
I tell you what, your movie ain't 'alf caused a stir round here!
You'd be surprised how many actors and actresses live locally.
I don't mean - you know, like professionals, I mean a lot of new, fresh, untapped talent!
Well, I made a list for yer, there you are.
You're not suggesting I use all these people in my film?
Just extras Rodney, just extras.
Never mind the quantity think about the quality!
I'm thinking about the money Del!
I did say, well a tenner a day.
I can't afford to pay 'em a tenner a day!
No, they pay us a tenner a day.
You're just exploiting people again ain't yer?
No I am not Rodney.
I've given 'em your word now.
Well you had no right to!
Alright here's your share.
There you go, look.
And they're just extras?
Just extras, that's all.
By the way, there's a list here of local businesses you might like to mention.
The Seventh Heaven Sauna Parlour?
Yeah, just a mention, something like 'The nice relaxing atmospheric, nice and friendly service.'
You know what I mean?
Oh, is the undertaker's down there?
- No.
- Oh well bear it in mind, will yer?
Del, why are you doing this to me?
I had high hopes when I started this project!
Mr Stevens said if it was good enough he'd show it at the National Film Theatre.
What's the matter with you, you're earning ain't yer?
Look, listen I've gotta shoot, I've got another client to meet.
It might mean another booking...
'Ere, talking about that...what is a 'natural birth'?
Never mind
- I'll find out myself.
Albert, d'you wanna lift?
Yeah, I'll be with you in a minute son.
Well come on, come on shift yourself I ain't got all night you know.
See you later.
Smile, you're on Candid Camera.
Alright, listen, I might have another booking for you later on.
I'll give you a bell, alright.
Alright Rodney?
No it's not alright!
This is getting out of hand!
Look!
What is it, a petition?
No, that's our cast list!
And this is a list of all the shops and businesses we've gotta advertise.
- He forgot the undertakers!
- You mean you knew about it?
Well it's good business Rodney!
Right, I'm off out now Rodney.
- I'll get it.
- Look it's gotta stop Mickey!
We're promoting shops and businesses, ain't we?
We've got more extras than Ben Hur there.
- Watcha babe.
This is Amanda.
- It's a what?
Amanda.
I'm taking her out for a drink tonight so I asked her round here so you could make her a nice cup of coffee.
Alright Rodney.
Yeah, okay.
- D'you take sugar?
- Two please.
Mickey, could I have a moment of your time please.
What's up?
Why is she wearing a nurse's uniform?
She's just come off duty!
Oh yeah.
You must think I've just come off a banana boat!
What are yer playing at?
Look, I've been delivering these films for Boycie ain't I, so I know where I can sell 'em.
We've got all this equipment, why waste it?
We can cut the middle-man out!
I'd like to cut your liver out.
You are not making any films in this flat.
Understand?
Both of you?
Alright Rodney, no need to get out yer pram about it.
Sit down.
I'll make you a cup of coffee then you can both hit the road.
What's happening?
What the bloody hell's happening?
I've got a cast of thousands, I've got more advertising than Pearl and Dean and now Mickey wants to make Emmanuelle in Peckham.
Oh, this is a bloody nightmare...
Now Rodney, Rodney...
Calm down...
Deep breaths...
Nice 'n' easy does it...
- Night Nurse Take One.
- Night Nurse Take One?
That's the way baby.
Let it slip to the ground.
Mickey...
You better not be doing...
Oh no Mickey.
No, get her to put 'em back!
Oh bloody hell!
Hold 'em up.
That's it.
Move 'em about a bit.
Oh hurry up Mickey love.
Boycie, he don't like smiling for too long.
Okay everybody, that's a wrap.
I wasn't ready for that one.
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary dear.
Oi, vicar get a move on.
We've got that christening to do in 20 minutes.
Yes, I'll be with you in just a moment Mickey.
Alright, I'll wait for you down the church then.
Alright Rodney?
- Shut up!
- Please yerself!
Here we go Rodney, my son, there is your share, alright?
I don't like this Del, you know I don't like this.
Ta.
Here Del, we're slipping out to the back room.
- Alright?
- Right, good Mike, yeah.
- Hi Rodney.
- Alright Mike.
Of all the bars in all the world and you had to walk into mine.
You in my film as well Mike are yer?
Yeah, just a little cameo role son.
I'll see you in a minute.
Come on Rodney.
Come on Albert.
It all seems to be going rather well.
Oh yeah, it's very nice innit vicar?
I married the happy couple all those years ago.
Of course, I had hoped by now that the Good Lord would have blessed their union with an offspring or two.
But if it's not to be...
Well I heard that because of the precarious state of the world,
Boycie and Marlene had decided against starting a family.
Oh really?
I heard that Boycie was a Jaffa.
Tell me, is it true that you're making a film Rodney?
Oh yeah.
We got an Arts Council grant.
I er...
I was talking with Derek earlier...
I'll give you a bell when we start shooting vicar.
Thank you my boy.
Alright - everyone got a drink have they?
Even the vicar's in on it Del.
- What you want to drink?
- Give us a beer.
Here.
Go on then my son.
- Watcha Dave.
- Alright Trigger.
- You dirty rat!
- Oh, this is getting bloody stupid.
Alright gentlemen, would you like to settle down.
If you'd like to take your seats.
Come on, here we go.
The Boycie Video and Leisure Arts Company is proud to present the British Premiere of Night Nurse from the novel by Enid Blyton.
Ooh, that was a bit unexpected innit?
Here look at that one.
I've got no sympathy for her, look.
No, no, Del that's gotta be special effects.
No that's real.
No stop - it's starting proper now.
Where do they get these grotty flats to film in?
'Ere I've seen that bird before somewhere.
Go on girl, let's have a look.
'Oh dear, I am tired I've just come back from nursing.'
One of those would do me a week.
Hello, who's got her ear muffs off now...
It was nothing to do with me Del.
It was a Mickey Pearce production!
Mickey Pearce.
You wait till I get my hands on him.
I'm 'gonna shove that camera 'alf a mile up his nostril!
Rodney, didn't you have any idea what you were getting yourself into?
I thought Boycie wouldn't be too pleased you know, someone muscling in on his business and that.
God.
Boycie.
Boycie's not the one that worries me.
It's his partners that are giving me grief.
D'you know who's backing him in this, only the Driscoll Brothers that's all.
- Have you heard of 'em?
- No.
No.
Well let's hope they haven't heard of you.
Now I'm gonna see if I can save your knees and make sure they stay in the same place.
Now I'm stuffing this down the khazi, you stay there.
Del, I promise nothing like this will ever happen again
- I promise.
Hello Rodney?
Alright for a cup of coffee?
- Oh yes, do come in Mickey.
- I brought a few friends with me.
Oh yes.
Pearcie!
I want a ruddy word with you.
Hello?
Oh Mr Stevens, hi!
Yeah, yeah and have you had a chance to read it?
Great.
Well what do you think?
And please be truthfully blunt with me.
Okay, yes, ah ha!
Yes well that's truthfully blunt innit Mr Stevens.
Yes, there are a lot of characters in it, yes, but all vital to the theme I thought.
Yes, well, I actually wanted to write a film that not only dealt with the contemporary issues but also challenged some of the more widely held beliefs of modern youth!
No, that is no problem because my brother knows where he can get us a rhino, yeah!

Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.
'It's time once again for The Million Dollar Question 'with your host Bob Kenney and returning contestant Mel Jordan.
- 'Mel, how are you doing?
' - 'OK, Bob.'
- 'Relaxed?
- 'Kinda, yeah.'
'Good for you.
You've done wonderfully well. 13 questions in a row.
'But now, this is what we call the moment of truth.'
Well, Bob, what geeks do you have for us today?
'These are the keys, this is the question for that brand-new automobile.
Are you ready?
'
- 'I sure am, Bob.' - 'Good.
Listen carefully.
'What city houses the National Football League Hall of Fame?
'For the keys to that brand-new car, what is your answer?
'
- Pack it up, pal.
You don't have a chance.
- 'Kenton, Ohio.'
'The home of the National Football League Hall of Fame is located in...
- 'Kenton, Ohio!
' - 'Yeah!
'
'You've got yourself a brand-new car!
All right!
'Mel Jordan.
Here are the keys.
Tomorrow on live TV, 'you'll be going for the grand prize on The Million Dollar Question!
'See you then.
Have a good day now.'
The only game show on TV I like is Divorce Court, 'cos they give away the best prize.
- Dory, did you see The Million Dollar Question?
- Morning.
No, I didn't, Grace.
I swear, I never miss it.
Anyhow, some guy is finally going for a million dollars.
- Oh, yeah?
- Nobody has ever gotten to that level.
What?
Are you two yapping about game shows?
I got a good game show for you.
It's called Let's Get Back To Work.
This is reality, this is not TV.
Boy, the women get together, the mouths go open and everybody's talking.
Comparing your favourite brands of soap and your water weight gain.
This isn't a beauty parlour.
It's a precinct.
OK.
Forget it.
Whoa.
I was just trying to be sociable.
Hammer, both men and women watch game shows.
It's a popular form of social entertainment.
Oh, listen.
Last week, I made an arson suspect walk across hot coals.
That's entertainment.
Game shows are for people that are low on brain cells.
That's not true.
Have you ever played Trivial Pursuit?
That takes brains.
Doreau, I am in pursuit of one thing, and that is justice.
And that takes bullets.
Hammer, there's been an automobile accident.
I want you and Doreau go to investigate.
An automobile accident?
Call the auto club.
An unlicensed vehicle went off the pier into the West River, Hammer.
Well, then, call the auto club and Flipper.
There is a dead body in the vehicle, Hammer.
Why do you always save the best for last?
Let's go, Doreau.
No.
Not until you drop the subject of game shows.
All right.
Let's make a deal.
Hey, come on.
Hoist that car up.
Ah, Inspector Hammer.
I'm sorry to get you out here.
Turns out to be another guy drinking and driving.
Are you sure he was drinking?
He was underwater, Doreau.
Of course he was drinking.
Inspector, it took a diver five minutes to pry this out of his hand.
- Too bad.
Got a wife.
- Ooh.
Well, that explains the drinking.
Majoy, over here.
Hey, I've seen that car before.
That's the car that that guy won on the game show this morning.
- Hammer, you're such a hypocrite.
- Why?
You said you hated those game shows.
I...
I...
I happen to have been preparing for this case, Doreau.
I have to keep informed.
Why weren't you watching?
Sledge Hammer.
Come on down.
Hey, we just found this guy's identification.
That's him.
Mel.
Mel Jordan was his name.
He was the winner on that game show this morning.
You mean he won this beautiful car on a game show?
You think that's funny, Majoy?
A man just lost his life.
Worse, he lost a chance to win a million dollars.
Sorry.
OK.
Jordan was under the influence.
Maybe he was celebrating too soon.
I don't know.
Maybe the pressure got to him.
I don't know why.
I saw him.
He was as calm as a Perry Como groupie.
I think we ought to visit his wife, the widow Jordan, and find out a few things.
Put together a few pieces.
- I'll move in a second, inspector.
- Never mind.
I'll go around.
Hammer, this has to be the hardest part of our job.
Telling a person someone a loved one is gone.
- I hate doing this.
- Well, just let me handle it.
Hello.
May I help you?
I'm Inspector Sledge Hammer, this is inspector Dori Doreau.
We're police officers.
What do you want?
Well, ma'am, there was a car accident.
Your husband's dead.
- Go ahead and cry if you want to.
- Oh, my God!
No!
We want to offer our deepest condolences, Mrs. Jordan.
Jordan?
But I'm Mrs. Perlan.
The Jordans live next door.
I was one house off.
That's...
This never would have happened if you had have your address clearly marked in the mail box here.
Consider it as a warning.
Come on.
Very sorry.
- Would you like a tissue?
- No, thank you.
I have a year's supply.
They came yesterday with all those other lovely prizes.
- Was your husband a heavy drinker?
- No, absolutely not.
Mel was kind and decent and gentle.
- Too bad he wasn't waterproof.
- Game shows and concerts were his life.
- When did you last talk to your husband?
- He called right after he won the car.
He said he was coming straight home to study.
You know, we were gonna start a family this year.
There's a game where you win a kid?
We have to be going now, Mrs. Jordan, but we just want to offer our deepest condolences.
Wait.
No.
Tell me...
Just how bad was the accident?
Well, if it's any consolation, it is one of the more peaceful ways to die.
Locked in a car, clawing the doors, your lungs fill up with water.
The first couple of minutes is pretty scary, but then you die so you don't know.
Isn't that amazing?
A man obsessed with game shows.
Another adult caught up in the materialism promoted by game shows.
I hate that.
So why did you accept those?
I wanted to make her feel better, all right?
These are beauties, too.
Phew!
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
You know, I never heard of a drunken driver who drowned in the drink and never drank.
- Hard to believe.
- It's also hard to say.
I think we should talk to the last people to see Mel Jordan alive.
And here's your host for The Million Dollar Question, Bob Kenney!
Ladies and gentlemen.
Our reigning champion Mel Jordan has been involved in a horrible automobile accident, and is no longer with us, so please, let us bow our heads and observe a moment of silence for dear Mel.
Well, life goes on.
Let's meet a new brand contestant.
We'll do that after this commercial break.
Don't go away.
We'll be back.
Excuse me.
May I help you?
Yes.
We're here to talk to Bob Kenney.
We're police officers.
- Sorry.
We're in the middle of a hit show.
- We're doing an investigation, creep.
Relax.
I always have time to talk to the police.
Why don't you put that college degree to work and get me some coffee?
- Right away, Bob.
- David, please.
Call me sir.
We know you're very busy, but we have questions we'd like to ask.
Questions.
That's my game.
Shoot.
Just kidding, Inspector.
- The category is Dead Mels.
- Yes, of course.
Mel.
You know, inspector, in this business we call show, contestants come and go, but Mel wasn't just a first name on a cheap tag.
No.
He had a last name too.
- What the hell was it?
- Jordan.
That's it.
Jordan.
Mel Jordan.
That's it.
Lovely guy.
Inge, would you please get lost?
Here's your coffee, sir.
By the way, great show today, sir.
Wind my watch.
Now, where were we?
- Mel Jordan.
Was he acting strange lately?
- Yes, I recall.
He was very, very nervous.
As a matter of fact, he had a few stiff drinks before he took that new car out for a spin.
Really?
Did he mention anything about driving drunkenly off a pier?
- No, I don't believe so.
- Look who's here, sir.
Oh.
It's my boy.
Glad I could be of some help.
- Who's that?
His kid?
- No.
President of the station.
I don't know, Hammer.
I think maybe for the first time Mel Jordan has been overwhelmed by his good fortune.
I don't buy it.
There's something about that guy I don't trust.
- What is that?
- He's a game show host.
- Who are you calling?
- The coroner.
- I want the final result of Mel Jordan's death.
- Oh, Hammer, you're so paranoid.
- Every death isn't a murder.
- Hey, I'm an optimist.
- Coroner's office.
- Norman.
I'm Sledge Hammer.
Hi.
A bunch of bodies came in but there's no jackets or shoes your size.
Hey, thanks for thinking of me.
No, I want the autopsy results on Mel Jordan.
That was intoxication, right?
No, there wasn't a single trace of alcohol on his blood stream.
Cause of death was a severe blow to the head.
Well, thanks, Norman.
- Well?
- Well, according the autopsy results,
Mel Jordan was dead sober.
Hammer.
Look at these old newspaper clippings.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, a sale on white walls.
No, below that.
There's an article on Bob Kenney.
Apparently, he filed for bankruptcy over a year ago, and had gambling debts of upwards of a million dollars.
State records show they were paid off six months ago.
A million-dollar prize and a million-dollar gambling debt.
That could explain why no-one gets to the million-dollar level.
Because he will not let them.
There's no money to win.
So he puts on people with the IQ of cotton.
Yeah?
What about Mel Jordan?
Mel Jordan took 'em by surprise.
He looks dumb, but he turned out to be a genius.
It's a trick I've used myself.
I think I'm going to have a little talk with
Bob Kenney about his choice of contestants.
What do you want from me now?
I've told you all I know about that Jordan guy.
Will you stop harassing me?
I'm a very busy man.
- Yes, Bob is a very busy man.
- Hey, I'm not harrassing you.
If I were harrassing you, you would know it.
Listen, I love your show.
I tape your show.
I wanna be on it.
- Are you kidding?
- Is he kidding, Bob?
- What are you, a ventriloquist's dummy?
- No, but I filled in for one once.
David, please get me some coffee.
Look, er...
Inspector.
You're just not the type for television.
Well, what do you mean?
Me and my gun are billed as regulars on the local news.
- Look.
Why don't you just leave?
- Shut up.
- Sure, Bob.
- Why don't we give the inspector a chance?
Er...
Run a question by him.
- Good idea, Bob.
- I'm game.
All right, Mr. Hammer.
What is the title of the Academy Award-winning film about a peace-loving man who united India?
Rambo.
I love it.
A cop with a sense of humour.
I'm gonna love promoting you on the air.
You're on the show.
Great.
You're kidding?
Well, great.
Terrific.
Oh, I look forward to it.
Maybe I can put you through bankruptcy, again...
- Bob, why are you putting him on?
- That guy's as dopey as all the others.
I'll humiliate him on local TV, deprive him of all credibility.
If he tries to charge us with something, it'll make him look like a sore loser.
Brilliant, Bob, but I'm scared.
Look.
You work for me.
I say when to be scared.
- You wanted to work in TV, didn't you?
- Yes.
But I killed a man for you.
That's part of working in TV.
Do you know how many people would kill you for your job?
OK, Bob.
OK.
- Can I get you some fresh coffee?
- No.
Your coffee-making days are over.
Make me a coffee cake.
- Hammer, you're going on that game show?
- Shh!
Just be...
Look.
It's the only way that I can prove that Kenney can't pay the grand prize.
I'm going all the way.
A million dollars.
Why did he let you on in the first place?
He thinks I'm not the brightest guy in the world.
Sledge, did it ever occur to you that you're not the brightest guy in the world?
That's why you're gonna help me.
I know a great reference library.
I'll get an ear radio from the SWAT team.
You feed me the answers.
- I can't lose.
- Well, that's cheating.
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.
'And now, let's give a big welcome to your host of The Million Dollar Question,
'Bob Kenney!
'Thank you very much for that warm reception.'
All right, Hammer.
I'm set.
Good luck.
Joan Walker back.
Nice to see you.
We need a challenger to you.
Who might that be?
Bob, our next contestant is a police officer whose hobbies are police work.
Please welcome Inspector Sledge Hammer.
Sledge.
Welcome to Million Dollar Question.
Now, remember, Sledge.
You are the challenger, that means you'll begin.
Before that, let's meet our prize lady, the lovely Inge.
Sledge, as you can see, we have five categories here.
They are... faces and places, food for though, the good book, famous perrys, grab bag.
- Pick a category.
- Grab Bag.
A tough category, my friend.
A potpourri of very hard questions.
Thank you, Inge.
Now, remember, Sledge.
Very important.
You control the board as long as you answer correctly.
Incorrect, Joan takes over.
Here is your first question, and listen carefully.
'What is the name of the artist 'whose famous painting depicts a beautiful woman standing in a clam shell?
'
Art, art, art...
Art, art, art...
OK.
I got it.
Wait, wait.
OK.
Botticelli.
Botticelli.
Correct.
What is the lowest temperature ever recorded in the continental United States?
Hold on, Hammer.
It's, er...
Er...

He was the only president without a first lady.

I'm looking.
It was, er... er...
James...

David Mamet.
A tie.

Right again!
You're one tough cop.
I've got my car parked on the red zone.
Wanna give me a ticket?
No.
I'm gonna blow you away.
Isn't he cute?
No, Sledge.
The siren means that you've answered 26 questions in a row.
That means that you can go for a million dollars on today show.
You know, nobody's ever gone this far before.
I know.
It's a crime.
'Well, let's find out if you're a real cop or if you're going to... cop out.'
He's making his move now, Sledge.
'I'm gonna go for it.'
Inge?
We'll be back with Sledge Hammer's final question in just a moment.
Don't go away.
That cop is a super genius.
We can't afford to pay him if he wins.
You fool.
No wonder you live with your mother.
Hammer won't win.
- There's going to be another accident.
- An accident after the show?
Not after the show.
During the show.
You see that big spotlight right over his head?
It's going to fall and kill him on the air.
We'll have millions of witnesses and the ratings will go through the roof.
- You can't do that.
- I know that.
You're going to do it.
- I've got to kill again?
- Please.
Just this once.
I'll do you a favour.
I'll take you miniature golfing.
- All right.
I'll kill him.
- One more thing.
- I know.
Get you a coffee.
- No, you spineless freak.
An espresso.
Welcome back to the show.
Well, Sledge, if you answer this question correctly, you win a cool million dollars.
'Incorrect, you lose everything.
'Good luck.'
Sledge!
Damn.
- What's the problem?
- I lost contact.
- Contact?
- Lens.
Oh.
We don't have time for that now.
Good luck.
- Has anyone seen Hammer today?
- Yeah, he's on a game show.
'All right.
Here's your question.
'Elmer Keith is known as the father of what?
You have ten seconds.'
Sledge, look out!
What are you doing, Doreau?
I could have answered that.
He invented the. 44 Magnum.
- I knew that one.
I knew it.
- Get Kenney.
I'll get his gofer.
Hold it right there.
He made me do it.
He forced me to kill that man.
And made me get coffee.
Hold it, Hammer.
- Game's over, cheeseball.
- Go to heck, cop.
- Go to heck?
- You can't say hell on television.
Let's give this guy his cancellation notice.
It's important to remove the turkey before its temperature reaches 107 degrees.
How about turning this thing off?
'The moon, the ocean.
You.'
How are you today?
Not very well at all.
Hey, this is a great show for kids.
'And this just in.
'What's going on here?
'Bob Kenney, game show host, is arrested for the murder of Mel Jordan.
'Bob Kenney is arrested for the murder of Mel Jordan.
You heard it here first, 'on KPSC news.'
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.
'It's time once again for The Million Dollar Question 'with your host Bob Kenney and returning contestant MeI Jordan.
- 'MeI, how are you doing?
' - 'OK, Bob. '
- 'Relaxed?
- 'Kinda, yeah. '
'Good for you.
You've done wonderfully well. 13 questions in a row.
'But now, this is what we call the moment of truth. '
Well, Bob, what geeks do you have for us today?
'These are the keys, this is the question for that brand-new automobile.
Are you ready?
'
- 'I sure am, Bob. ' - 'Good.
Listen carefully.
'What city houses the national Football League Hall of Fame?
'For the keys to that brand-new car, what is your answer?
'
- Pack it up, pal.
You don't have a chance.
- 'Kenton, Ohio. '
'The home of the national Football League Hall of Fame is located in...
- 'Kenton, Ohio!
' - 'Yeah!
'
'You've got yourself a brand-new car!
All right!
'MeI Jordan.
Here are the keys.
Tomorrow on live TV, 'you'll be going for the grand prize on The Million Dollar Question!
'See you then.
Have a good day now. '
The only game show on TV I like is Divorce Court cos they give away the best prize.
- Did you see The Million Dollar Question?
- No, I didn't, Grace.
I swear, I never miss it.
Anyhow, some guy is finally going for a million dollars.
- Oh, yeah?
- Nobody has ever gotten to that level.
What?
Are you two yapping about game shows?
I got a good one for ya.
It's called Let's Get Back To Work.
This is reality, this is not TV.
Boy, the women get together, the mouths open and everybody's talking.
Comparing your favourite brands of soap and your water weight gain.
This isn't a beauty parlour.
It's a precinct.
OK.
Forget it.
Whoa.
I was just trying to be sociable.
Hammer, men and women watch game shows.
It's a popular form of entertainment.
Oh, listen.
Last week, I made an arson suspect walk across hot coals.
That's entertainment.
Game shows are for people that are low on brain cells.
That's not true.
Have you ever played trivial Pursuit?
That takes brains.
Doreau, I am in pursuit of one thing, and that is justice.
And that takes bullets.
There's been an automobile accident.
I want you and Doreau to investigate.
An automobile accident?
Call the auto club.
An unlicensed vehicle went off the pier into the West River, Hammer.
Well, then, call the auto club and Flipper.
There is a dead body in the vehicle, Hammer.
Why do you always save the best for last?
Let's go, Doreau.
No.
Not until you drop the subject of game shows.
All right.
Let's make a deal.
Hey, come on.
Hoist that car up.
Ah, Inspector Hammer.
I'm sorry to get you out here.
Turns out to be another guy drinking and driving.
- Are you sure he was drinking?
- He was underwater.
Of course he was.
Inspector, it took a diver five minutes to pry this out of his hand.
- Too bad.
Got a wife.
- Ooh.
Well, that explains the drinking.
Majoy, over here.
Hey, I've seen that car before.
That's the car that that guy won on the game show this morning.
- Hammer, you're such a hypocrite.
- Why?
You said you hated game shows.
I...
I...
I happen to have been preparing for this case, Doreau.
I have to keep informed.
Why weren't you watching?
Sledge Hammer.
Come on down.
Hey, we just found this guy's identification.
That's him.
mel.
mel Jordan.
He was the winner on that game show this morning.
You mean he won this beautiful car on a game show?
You think that's funny, Majoy?
A man just lost his life.
Worse, he lost a chance to win a million dollars.
Sorry.
OK.
Jordan was under the influence.
Maybe he was celebrating too soon.
I don't know.
Maybe the pressure got to him.
I don't know why.
I saw him.
He was as calm as a Perry Como groupie.
I think we ought to visit his wife, the widow Jordan, and find out a few things.
Put together a few pieces.
- I'll move in a second.
- Never mind.
I'll go around.
This has to be the hardest part of our job.
Telling someone a loved one is gone.
- I hate doing this.
- Well, just let me handle it.
Hello.
May I help you?
I'm Inspector Sledge Hammer, this is Dori Doreau.
We're police officers.
- What do you want?
- Well, ma'am.
Your husband's dead.
- Go ahead and cry if you want to.
- Oh, my God!
No!
We want to offer our deepest condolences, Mrs Jordan.
Jordan?
But I'm Mrs Perlan.
The Jordans live next door.
I was one house off.
That's...
This never would have happened if your address was clearer.
This is a warning.
Come on.
Very sorry.
- Would you like a tissue?
- No, thank you.
I have a year's supply.
They came yesterday with all those other lovely prizes.
- Was your husband a heavy drinker?
- No, absolutely not.
mel was kind and decent and gentle.
- Too bad he wasn't waterproof.
- Game shows and concerts were his life.
- When did you last talk to your husband?
- He called right after he won the car.
He said he was coming straight home to study.
You know, we were gonna start a family this year.
There's a game where you win a kid?
We have to be going now, Mrs Jordan, but we want to offer our deepest condolences.
Wait.
No.
Tell me...
Just how bad was the accident?
Well, if it's any consolation, it is one of the more peaceful ways to die.
Locked in a car, clawing the doors, your lungs fill up with water.
I guess the first couple of minutes is pretty scary, but then you die so you don't know.
Isn't that amazing?
A man obsessed with game shows.
Another adult caught up in the materialism promoted by game shows.
I hate that.
- So why did you accept those?
- I wanted to make her feel better, all right?
These are beauties, too.
Phew!
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
You know, I never heard of a drunken driver who drowned in the drink and never drank.
- Hard to believe.
- It's also hard to say.
I think we should talk to the last people to see mel Jordan alive.
And here's your host for The Million Dollar Question, Bob Kenney!
Ladies and gentlemen.
Our reigning champion MeI Jordan was involved in a horrible automobile accident and is no longer with us, so please, let us bow our heads and observe a moment of silence for dear MeI.
Well, life goes on.
Let's meet a new contestant.
We'll do that after this break.
Don't go away.
We'll be back.
Excuse me.
May I help you?
We're here to talk to Bob.
We're police officers.
- Sorry.
We're in the middle of a hit show.
- We're doing an investigation, creep.
Relax.
I always have time to talk to the police.
Put that degree to work and get me some coffee.
- Right away, Bob.
- David, please.
Call me sir.
We know you're busy but we have questions we'd like to ask.
Questions.
That's my game.
Shoot.
Just kidding, Inspector.
- The category is Dead Mels.
- Yes, of course.
mel.
You know, in this business we call show, contestants come and go but mel wasn't just a first name on a cheap tag.
No.
He had a last name too.
- What the hell was it?
- Jordan.
That's it.
Jordan.
mel Jordan.
That's it.
Lovely guy.
Inge, would you please get lost?
Here's your coffee, sir.
By the way, great show today, sir.
Wind my watch.
Now, where were we?
- mei Jordan.
Was he acting strange lately?
- He was very, very nervous.
As a matter of fact, he had a few stiff drinks before he took that car out for a spin.
Really?
Did he mention anything about driving drunkenly off a pier?
- No, I don't believe so.
- Look who's here, sir.
Oh.
It's my boy.
Glad I could be of some help.
- Who's that?
His kid?
- No.
President of the station.
I don't know.
I think for the first time Jordan has been overwhelmed by good fortune.
I don't buy it.
There's something about that guy I don't trust.
- What is that?

- Hammer, you're going on that game show?
- Shh!
Just be...
Look.
It's the only way to prove Kenney can't pay the grand prize.
I'm going all the way.
A million dollars.
- Why did he let you on in the first place?
- He thinks I'm not the brightest guy.
Sledge, did it ever occur to you that you're not the brightest guy in the world?
That's why you're gonna help me.
I know a great reference library.

They don't come up every day. 150?
150 I'm bid.
Come on, gentlemen, I'm looking for 350.
350 anywhere?
Don't lose it, madam, don't lose it for another 50.
350 anywhere?
350 I'm bid.
At 350.
Who'll make it four?
I'm looking for four.
Any more?
At 350.
Are you all done?
At 350?
At 350...
Lovejoy.
(Music on radio)
(Radio) Hello and welcome to the Radio Norfolk Farming Program.
Did you see that?
So, the barman, feeling very embarrassed by this time, says, "That's funny, we've even got a Scotch named after you."
"Really?" says the horse. "Eric?"
- No, well, I still don't get it.
- It was a white horse.
Well, maybe I'm missing the point because my name is Eric.
Oh, gimme a break.
Well, is there a whisky called Eric?
Oh, Eric!
# You've been running and hiding much too long
# You know it's just your foolish pride
- # Layla...
- (Sirens)
# You got me on my knees
# Layla
# I'm begging, darling, please, Layla
# Darling, won't you ease my worried mind
# Tried to give you consolation... #
(Switches off radio)
Don't get out.
- What?
- Don't get out.
It's not the bloody Gestapo.
- Get out, please.
- Certainly, Officer.
- Have you got a Road Fund License for this?
- Oh, it's a friend's.
Well, an acquaintance's.
Well, more of a casual acquaintance.
- It's still an offense.
- I've no doubt.
Driving a vehicle without a road license and your load's loose.
That's my assistant's area.
- Get out of there.
- Why?
You said it wasn't the bloody Gestapo.
Eric!
Do me a favor?
Some people might call this passing the buck, shirking one's responsibility, but Eric has got to learn the antiques trade from the bottom.
Can't be much closer to the bottom, being pulled over by the polizei on your way to Newmarket to offload some junk.
The lad says you arranged the loads.
I advised him.
You see, loading valuable antiques is a skill.
The load that looks the least secure is the most professionally arranged.
- Thank you, Officer.
- I see.
Well, get this thing off the road till you can produce a proper MOT and Road Fund License.
Of course.
Thank you, Officer.
My partner wanted to do you.
Well, he obviously lacks your judgment.
Just watch how you go.
How do you get away with it?
Experience.
(Grunting)
- Easy.
Hold it.
- All right, you got it?
OK.
So what do you think, Ricky?
Most of that stuff's firewood, Lovejoy, but you know that, don't you?
(Lovejoy) You knew where I was going when we made the deal.
She was a nice old bird, Miss Wesley.
Bought one or two good pieces from me over the years.
See anything here?
Mm.
- What'd you give?
- A grand.
(Laughs) They saw you coming.
Berwick Partners wind up half the estates in the area.
- It's worth a grand, you know it.
- I'll give you a monkey.
- Stop poncing about, I'll go to Nessem.
- He wouldn't give you more.
He'd give me a grand and that's a Parliament clock if ever I saw one.
Worth what?
300 to the right punter.
All right, I'll give you the clock and 600.
- Nine.
- Seven.
There's your thou and that's it.
What about my time, petrol, the lad's pay?
He's paying you, Lovejoy.
Biggest joke in the trade.
Well, throw another clock in.
- Which one?
- That one.
Ah!
Had your eye on that all along, eh?
- Well...
- Come off it, Lovejoy, I know you.
Nice clock.
Worth sod all without the works.
I'll put something in it.
Dress it up and find a mark.
600 and both clocks.
700 and I'll take the Parliament.
Of course, this is what you really came for.
Pay the lawyers with a check.
Uncle Ricky pays you cash.
- I didn't come for your terrible beer.
- You're a snob, Lovejoy.
Not where cash is concerned.
Oh, go on, take the other bloody clock.
Price, you're a prince.
Oh, Lovejoy, it's exactly right.
It's called an Act of Parliament.
No, I'm not with you.
Well, in 1797 an iniquitous tax was levied by William Pitt on clocks and watches of all kinds.
I think it was five shillings for a watch or a timekeeper and ten shillings for a gold watch or any gold timekeeper, which as I recalled,
"was used for the purpose of a watch, whatever name that same shall be called."
Well, no loopholes there.
Exactly, so most people, not having a clock or a watch or a timekeeper of any kind, would visit the local pub which had a large functional wall clock.
Thank you.
So, they could have a drink and tell the time too.
Clever idea.
Mm.
Do you like it?
Oh, it's smashing.
I'm going to put it up right... here.
Now, how much?
It's a gift.
Oh, don't be stupid, you're always broke.
- 190.
- Hm, seems fair.
Did anything else take your fancy?
Quite a nice French clock.
No insides, but I'll dress it up and sell it to some punter.
I'm surprised you hadn't thought of a battery.
Janey!
If I could only get away with it.
(Sighs)

Dear Mistress Fairfax, I have today...
"Dear Mistress Fairfax, I have today written to your father... your kind father...
"thanking him with deep sincerity
"for inviting a mere ensign of Dragoons to such an illustrious home.
"Next month, on the 18th, to be precise, the regiment will move to Thetford
"for maneuvers with the Light Cavalry Brigade."
"My dearest love..."
"With all my love."
Oh, that's magic!
Can you hear me?
I not only hear you, Lovejoy, I can see both of you.
I did that bereavement sale today, Topplehill Farm.
Knocked it out to Ricky Price for a considerable loss I heard.
I collected a couple of clocks, got rid of one, the other should bring a few hundred.
French case, sans works.
I didn't realize this sale was on the radio.
You've got that Japanese counterfeit mechanism if it'll fit.
It fits and there's more.
Of course there's more, Lovejoy.
You never get flushed over money.
Only a great deal of money.
Love letters, a lady's - found them in the clock.
- When?
- About two hours ago.
No, you fool, when were they written?
I can hardly see a bunch of lady's love letters, circa 1957, exciting much fervor, unless of course, they're unspeakably pornographic.
Early 19th century.
Bravo, lovers!
Course, you'll need Tinker.
Tinker's an expert on letters.
Publishing, newspaper serial rights.
Another round, duchess, on Lovejoy.
Publisher's advance.
(Jane) How many years do they cover?
About two.
From the first time Ensign Parker visited the general's house to the eve of the Battle of Waterloo.
By which time the general's daughter Miss Fairfax and the young ensign were in love.
Oh, hopelessly, passionately doomed, just like us.
One day you'll say that to some poor girl who thinks you mean it.
I don't suppose there's any chance of tracking down the girl's letters to the young ensign?
Probably lying under the sod at Haut Allemand.
Where's that?
It's part of the field at Waterloo where most of the 8th Dragoons were killed.
Soldier probably wrote this in his tent, wound up, cleaning his kit, ready to meet the French.
"My dearest love, your letter now received, makes my heart leap.
"Can it be true that you long for me as I long for you?"
(Lovejoy) That's true love, Jane.
Infinitely more romantic than the telex "Back Tuesday, how about a bit?"
Oh, that reminds me, Alexander's back tonight.
What time's my new clock say?
10:22.
I must go.
I'm picking him up at the airport.
Collecting him at midnight?
True love.
Let yourselves out, and do leave him a drop of Scotch.
(Door opening)
Oh, no, I didn't leave this bloody door open, and I didn't leave this bloody light on!
Ever since you got that burglar alarm, Lovejoy, you've been turned over at least twice a week.
I wish they'd steal the bloody alarm!
Well, the clock's gone!
I suppose they got what they came for.
Or did they?
Excuse me, Officer.
Just going by, they were, Sarge, but I recognized 'em.
It's the two we pulled up for an unsecure load, driving that vehicle.
Thanks, Dixon.
Nixon, Sarge.
Oh, yes, well, thanks.
Very observant of you.
Actually, I know who that man is...
only too well.
(Man) Excuse us please, gents.
- Ricky?
- Get him to hospital.
What happened?
You two, inside.
So... come back to visit the scene of the crime, have you?
What are you talking about?
Barry.
A description of his assailant, such as he was able to give, was...
"Stockily built,
"five-nine,
"scruffily dressed,
"dark curly hair,
"olive complexion,
"late 30s."
So?
Fits you perfectly.
- Yeah, it does actually.
- Don't be stupid!
You brought that lorry here yesterday.
It's Ricky's.
He's a friend of mine.
I was bringing some gear back from a bereavement sale, old farmhouse in the fen country.
So why are you back here so soon?
You're not going to try to tickle me for grievous bodily harm, are you?
Just checking on a motive.
Revenge, robbery, who knows.
You're turning his place over last night and Price comes back unexpectedly.
That's like that movie, erm, Graham Greene, wasn't it?
Brighton Rock.
No, no, Gun For Sale I was thinking of.
No, no, what was that one that finished up in Hollis someplace?
Little actress involved?
- Some See...
- Excuse me for interrupting this highly articulate, literary and cinematic discussion, but Ricky, remember Ricky?
I think he was done by a stranger.
Don't kid me.
You lot
- I read the papers.
Graft, greed and God knows.
However, we don't think money was the motive.
No, Price had 400 in cash on him.
Yes, he was able to say a few words.
Seems some bloke beat him up last night for information about a clock.
(Lovejoy) That clock was only of use to someone who a, knew of the letters,
- or b, had the original mechanism.
- And?
Maybe the person who nicked the clock was not the same one who beat up Ricky, but if he is, things could get nasty, Eric.
Well, I'm glad I started that martial arts course at the Ipswich Poly.
- Yeah, I just wish you'd finished it.
- Where we off to then?
Square one.
Berwick Partners, bereavement solicitors.
You did very well at that auction, Topplehill Farm.
No house contents deserve to go for £670.
- Shh.
- Six?
Erm, did anyone else show any interest at all in any particular piece of the house contents apart from me?
Let me make it quite clear that we never... absolutely never divulge details of client or customer affairs.
Mr. Berwick, someone could be in grave danger.
Then you should contact the police.
Well, yes, I should, but then the police, followed by the hordes of press, television, news cameras,
I don't think they'd be very welcome to your client, nor indeed to your offices.
Fairfax.
There was an S.K. Fairfax who wrote asking if the sale date could be put back.
It couldn't, of course.
Ads had been posted and so on.
S.K. Fairfax?
I really don't see what use this is going to be to you.
Rest assured, if we do find anything untoward, we shall keep Berwick Partners out of it.
Then we understand each other.
(Horses whinnying)
I can't see anyone owning all this wanting an extra clock.
I think those letters have gone to your head, Lovejoy.
Shouldn't be piddling around the country like this, we should be back home trying to make a dishonest living.
Eric... do you ever get the feeling you've been someplace before?
Yeah.
I went to this Judas Priest concert last year, and I thought, "Eric, you've been here before."
Just déja vu.
Not really, I'd been to see Iron Maiden there the month before.
If you're not careful, Eric, you'll end up in one of those camps.
What camps?
Those internment camps they have for heavy metal freaks over on Foulness Island.
- Eh?
- Seriously.
Scrappy and Chas make you listen to Leonard Cohen records all day.
Leonard who?
Can I help you?
Um...
Fairfax, I'm looking for a Mr. Fairfax, S.K.
Well, I'm Sophy Fairfax and my brother's Michael, so which one do you want?
I've made my mind up.
Help yourself to sugar.
So, you were asking about Miss Wesley's auction.
The late Miss Wesley.
You wrote to the solicitors asking them to postpone the sale.
I couldn't get over on the day of the auction.
It was... a personal matter.
Anything in particular you wanted to bid for?
A couple of things, sentimental value.
You see, Michael and I are half Wesley and certain of Aunt's effects were family heirlooms.
I bought the lot.
You did?
Well, nobody turned up.
Well, a couple of neighbors, but no serious competition.
So, you've got all the contents?
No.
Sold them to a colleague in the trade.
(Eric slurping)
Would you excuse us a moment, please?
Eric... take a little walk.
Where to?
Edinburgh.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Hm?
Oh, I'm sorry, I just keep feeling we've met before.
I'm still not sure why you're here.
Are you sure you're not a lawyer or a detective or something?
I'm a something.
- I kept a couple of things back.
- And one was a clock.
How did you know?
Mr. Lovejoy, I have known all about that clock since I was 12 years old.
My mother told Michael and I about it.
What exactly did she say?
Quite obviously if you've gone to all this trouble to track me down, you must have found Ensign Parker's letters.
Yes, I did as a matter of fact.
I've never read them.
They're a delight.
A love affair.
If we could only trace her letters to him.
Oh, Michael has them.
They belong to us both.
After Ensign Parker was killed, his father found them and sent them to Sarah.
She died in June 1816 of a broken heart.
I wonder what she looked like.
Richard sketched her, on a bridge beside a watermill.
I wonder why the two sets of letters were kept apart.
Oh, some stupid family squabble.
Do you know what a publisher would give for those?
That's why I wanted to go to the Topplehill auction, to bid for the clock.
Michael and I were left this pile but not much money.
I've got his, you've got hers.
If I find a publisher, we could split the proceeds.
You'll have to speak to Michael first.
Do you think this Michael Fairfax will part with the girl's letters to Ensign Parker?
Do you know, I would be happy just to read them?
Oh, you sentimental old thing.
Pretty, was she?
I don't know.
Apparently, he sketched her by a watermill.
- I mean Sophy.
- Oh, she's OK, I suppose.
Mm.
That pretty.
Devastating.
It's a lovely house, Winton Stud.
Old Colonel Fairfax was a helluva character.
- You knew him?
- Mm.
He used to be a top Newmarket breeder until the bottle caught up with him.
He had a beautiful wife.
She died in a hunting accident.
Way to go.
(Door bangs)
Oh, don't bother to knock.
Landlord's privilege.
Good morning, Lady Felsham.
Visiting the proles, are we?
Well, I sometimes drop by with scraps of food and drink.
I thought that wine wasn't Lovejoy's.
Chardonnay '78?
Oh, excellent!
Ah, and these are the letters, are they?
Hands off!
Tinker said they were valuable.
Lovejoy may be onto something.
He thinks the letters are the reason someone broke in last night.
And beat up Ricky Price.
Well, whoever it was is wasting his time.
What do you mean?
Well, the letters of Ensign Richard Parker to Miss Fairfax are certainly worth a few grand, unquestionably.
Come on, Charlie, out with it.
Well, it's simply this - the original letters happen to be the property of the Royal Suffolk Yeomanry.
A T.A. Regiment whose military ancestors fought at Waterloo, among them, Ensign Richard Parker.
You're putting me on.
Au contraire!
I was there recently, purchasing items superfluous to requirements, and I can assure you, the letters are prominently displayed.
Yes, the Yeoman are very proud of them.
You don't think I'd come all the way over here to bring you good news, do you, Lovejoy?
Ta for the wine.
Mm, be better in a year or two.
Ah, well... everything'll be better in a year or two, eh?
(Church bells)
- Michael Fairfax?
- That's right.
- Your sister might have mentioned me.
- 0h, um, Lovejoy.
I'm sorry about the mess.
What sort of deal are you offering?
I thought a 50/50 split.
Do you think a publisher might be interested?
We can only ask.
- Are you all right?
- Sorry?
You just seem a little nervous.
No, I'm fine.
Um, would you like a drink?
A bit early, isn't it?
Why don't you simply buy the letters?
How much?
Well, I thought... about £10,000.
- I don't know what they're worth.
- You're a dealer.
Yes, but that's a far cry from publishing old letters.
I thought I'd take them to an expert and then see.
Mm.
A bit strapped for cash, are you?
You know how things are.
Yes, but you inherited half of Winton Stud.
Death duties, old chap.
Sophy and I are practically destitute.
She seems to manage.
Yeah, she doesn't have my overheads.
Oh.
(Tinker) What overheads does he mean?
(Lovejoy) Coke.
- Never drink the stuff.
- Cocaine.
Colombian marching powder.
Oh, you mean... (Sniffs)?
Yeah.
He also looked guilty.
Why guilty?
I reckon he's the bloke who stole my clock.
Not for the clock, of course.
For the love letters in the clock.
Do you reckon he's the bloke who roughed up Ricky Price?
It's a thought.
The more I think about it, the more I know my clock's in his crummy flat.
I could sense it.
- Hm?
- Come back.
I'm sorry, Tink, I was just... thinking back to Sergeant Drabble.
I hope you haven't brought me all this way on a wild goose chase.
I'll just say enough to scare him a little.
(Sighs) I don't like it.
This is not our turf.
Dirty Harry wouldn't worry about a formality like that.
(Knock on door)
Oh, back so soon?
- Something's bothering me.
- What's that?
May I come in?
Did-Did you bring the letters with you?
- No, I didn't think that would be a good idea.
- There's not a problem, is there?
Yesterday, you said you were strapped for cash - how strapped?
- I'm not with you.
- Desperate.
How desperate?
What the hell do you mean?
!
Well, cocaine's a very expensive habit, especially if you're short of readies.
(Laughs) Cocaine?
!
Cocaine!
Rich man's sherbet.
Now, look here!
Come off it, you didn't get that sniffle feeding the ducks.
What's it to you?
You're not a cop.
No, I'm not, but certain things are beginning to add up.
And you worry me, Fairfax.
- I ought to ask you to get out of here.
- I'll save you the trouble.
But do drop me a line.
Well, you know where I live.
Two bloody hours, Lovejoy!
I'm surprised we haven't been wheel-clamped.
This white horse walked into a pub...
I know, name of Albert.
- Eric.
- I heard it as Albert.
It's probably a different story.
I doubt it.
(Lovejoy) There he is.
Ooh!
Ah!
Michael Owen Fairfax, I'm arresting you on suspicion of burglary.
You're not obliged to say anything if you don't wish, but I must warn you that anything you do say will be taken down and used in evidence.
Bloody, bloody Michael!
(Horses whinnying)
He was such a super brother when we were young.
I'm really very sorry.
It's not your fault.
And the letters are fakes.
They certainly are not!
Apparently, some part-time Dragoons have the real ones in their museum.
So, you mean... mine could be worthless?
It wasn't unusual for families to make copies of letters.
Perhaps mine are the originals and the regiment have the fakes.
Oh, Lovejoy, couldn't you find out?
Guard!
Get on... parade!
Just a moment, please, sir.
Guard!
Get your self in order!
I have an appointment with your adjutant.
I'm afraid you're improperly dressed to join the officers, sir.
Regimental dinner this evening, sir.
Oh, that takes me back.
India.
Never missed an episode of Jewel In The Crown.
Could I enquire the nature of your business, sir?
Yes, certainly - the Ensign Parker letters.
Beg pardon, sir?
They're on display in your museum.
This will explain.
A copy already sent to your adjutant.
Imperial War Museum, sir.
Yes.
I'm one of the curators, Lovejoy, C.J., Captain.
Sorry, sir, very sorry.
I'll see what I can do, sir.
- Mr. Lovejoy?
- Yes.
- John Engleton.
- How do you do?
I would have arrived earlier but I had car trouble.
- I can't understand not receiving this.
- Some postal strike somewhere, I expect.
Bad moment, I'm afraid.
You've come on an evening when we can't show you hospitality.
Not to worry, another time, perhaps.
You won't be going to dinner for a while, will you?
- An hour and a half or so.
- It won't take nearly that long.
What exactly is it you wish to check?
The museum recently received a collection of military relics - legacy of the late General...
Catchpole.
Catchpole, who's he?
Northern commander, retired long before the war.
Regrettably, in the general's things were a lot of copies, including a set of Ensign Parker's papers.
No dishonesty intended of course, the copies somehow must have slipped in.
Oh, Lord.
Well, I hope ours aren't fakes.
Oh, I'm sure they're not but we just have to re-verify, make comparisons, in case any fakes may pop up again.
- Of course.
- (Footsteps approaching)
Excuse me, sir, Colonel Ander's party's here, sir.
Good Lord, he's early.
You be all right?
Mm?
Yes.
Right.
Right, Sergeant Major.
Duty bugler, break post!
Guard will move to the right!
Right turn!
- By the left, quick march!
- (Footsteps approach)
- Look, I hate to hurry you.
- No, no, not at all.
Hate to be caught in mufti - not like this anyway.
No, no, they're splendid.
Splendid fakes.
- Mm?
- Oh, no, no, no, my letters, not yours.
Oh, jolly good.
When were the letters given to the Yeomanry?
I think it was around 1918.
Four Fairfaxes and three Wesleys died with us, you know.
Old Lady Fairfax was a bit short of cash.
We're a wealthy mess, we purchased the letters, though we treated them as a gift.
Officers and... gentlemen, eh?
Precisely.
Well, I'm glad our letters are authentic.
I know an authentic letter when I see one.
Jolly good.
Well, nice to have met you, Captain Lovejoy.
(Lovejoy) Hello, Charlie.
Wait in the car, would you, dear?
Another one of your nieces?
She's in the trade, Lovejoy.
Fronts for Sothebys.
(Lovejoy) She's deductible then.
You're looking very well groomed.
Been in court, have we?
No, I went over to that regiment you told me about.
You were right, they have the letters, the real ones, unhappily.
There wasn't much money in it, was there?
There's a limit to what a collector will pay for that sort of thing.
I wasn't thinking of collecting, I was thinking more in terms of publishing.
Sunday Times, Observer, syndication.
Could've made a stack.
Really?
Mm, afraid so.
So, it's been a bit of a blow then, has it?
That's life, Lovejoy.
You switched them?
I had to.
Tink, I just had that feeling, you know?
So I kept a couple of my letters back and had them compared in a lab to those in the officers' mess.
Theirs were the originals.
You're gonna wind up in court.
Or worse still, court-martialed - you know what the bloody army are like.
I'm not going to sell them.
I just want the Fairfaxes to have the real ones.
The army'll never know.
They're just stuck in some museum next to Hussars' hats and Crimean War medals.
That Sophy has really addled your brains, Lovejoy.
No!
OK, well, tell me the worst.
There is no doubt that your letters... are the authentic letters.
Oh!
(Laughs)
Oh, thank God!
Do you really think we might get £10,000?
I think we could but there's a snag.
What's that?
Who was Lady Fairfax round about 1918?
Er, 1918?
That would've been...
my great-grandmother, why?
Seems the old bird sold the Royal Suffolk Yeomanry forged copies.
She was as hard up as you are.
I think your brother's trial will be a big enough disgrace for the Fairfax family without bringing great-grandma into it, don't you?
I suppose so.
I'm still desperately short of cash though.
You've got a house here full of things with much less sentimental attachments than these letters.
What do you mean?
I mean... why don't you keep the letters, all of them, and let me organize an auction for you?
I don't know how to thank you.
Yes, you do.
You can start by having dinner with me and then a trip to Venice and then you can have my child.
It's the girl in the letters you're in love with.
No, it's not.
(Car horn)
Unfortunately, my heart is promised to another.
Nick's in the army.
- Ensign?
- Lieutenant!
We're getting married soon.
Well, Nick was quite a nice fella, really, for a Hooray.
(Laughs)
I'm going to organize an auction for her to sell some stuff from Winton House.
She'll get the cash and she needn't sell the letters.
And her and the young ensign will live happily ever after.
I suppose so.
Well, you got her brother chucked into prison.
Perhaps you could have the fiancé cashiered from the army.
Well, actually, no, I don't think it is a touching story.
I think you're going soft in the head.
I mean, look at this lot!
There's nothing here worth more than £400.
Oh, you're teaching me, I like it.
You could've been £5,000 richer from those letters.
Don't give me a hard time, Eric, all right, it's for the family honor.
Oh, yeah, I can just see you worrying about her if she was fat and frumpy.
She's not, is she?
Morning, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll start with lot 200 on the hymn sheet.
A fine rosewood sideboard with carved legs and Georgian style door handles.
Shall we say 300?
Come now, it's worth 300, surely?
Who'll give me 200, then?
200, thank you, sir.
220.
240.
260 I'm bid.
280?
280.
300 anywhere?
Do I hear 300?
I'm selling then at £280.
Are you all done?
Lot 201, a set of eight dining room chairs with carver, Victorian.
Can we see this lot, please?
Here.
Over here.
(Laughter)
Thank you, sir.
I'll open at 400.
Do I hear 400?
300, then.
Must be worth three, surely?
This is painful.
300 then, it must be worth three, surely.
What's the matter with you all?
These are fine Victorian chairs.
(Woman) 190!
No, no, no, I'll take 245.
Absolute bargain here.
£245.
I'm selling then, at a maiden bid.
Are you all done?
(Bangs gavel)
Lot 202, box of bric-a-brac.
Where do you wanna start?
A fiver?
Three quid then.
A bit bloody slow.
- What is it, Tink?
- There's nothing to give them a buzz.
Stuff's all right.
There's a couple of really sweet pieces that that thieving brother didn't nick.
I think they're waiting for you to start.
They've seen you nosing around.
If you start bidding, they'll bid against you and we'll get this whole thing off the ground.
The next lot is a pretty little pen and ink drawing - girl sitting on a bridge beside a watermill.
Amanda.
It's dated on the back June 1814, and it's signed "Richard Parker".
How did I miss that?
Not in the catalog, this one.
It's a new entry.
Where do you wanna start me then?
Shall we say £10?
£10 I'm offered, thank you.
Come now, sure...
Twenty.
Mr. Lovejoy, £20.
Thirty?
Forty?
- Fifty?
- Eighty.
One hundred?
120.
140.
160.
180.
That'll do, boss.
You can pull out now.
£200.
This really is a rare and delightful item.
Signed and dated, Richard Parker.
220.
240.
260.
280.
300. £300.
380.
390.
Do I hear 400?
400, Mr. Lovejoy.
410.
420.
Mr. Lovejoy, 430.
440.
Thank you, madam.
Leave it out, Lovejoy.
It's not worth 60, never mind 440.
- It's worth it to me.
- 450, Mr. Lovejoy.
- D'you mean you want it?
- It's a lady I've come to know very well.
460.
470.
480.
Mr. Lovejoy?
(Tinker) You've flipped.
He's finally flipped.
Talk sense to him, Charlie, for God's sake!
490 for that drawing, Lovejoy, and I'll take you to court tomorrow for back rent.
...at £480.
Are you all done?
(Sophy) 500.
New face.
I'm selling then, to the lady at the back of the hall for £500.
(Bangs gavel)
Thanks.
I'll...
I'll be in the pub.
I'm pleasantly surprised.
You netted £7,310.
Oh, that's wonderful!
It's twice what you expected.
It's all down to that little drawing really.
From £10 to £500.
That really got their adrenaline going.
A sale needs something like that, you know.
Mm, I like it.
It's the best commission I ever had.
I'd like you to take this.
Without you, there'd have been no sale.
- I couldn't.
- Oh, yes, you could.
- Well, I'd settle for...
- I'll be off then.
Thank you very much again for all your help.
Maybe not.
Earn yourself a few quid, did you?
Your rent, Charlie.
No, forget it.
- I owe you one, Lovejoy.
- You owe me?
Where'd I go wrong?
I never realized the value of those letters until you put me in the picture.
So I went over to the Suffolk Yeomanry's mess.
I know the colonel there.
Shoots at my place.
Uses the boat occasionally.
Very chummy.
So, he was quite amenable to the deal.
What deal?
I get them some Peninsular War artefact, ten grand, and they gave me the letters.
Sunday Times, News Of The World, full syndication.
Yes, should make quite a stack.
That was the expression you used, wasn't it, Lovejoy?
(Charlie laughs)
- I'll pay you back.
- Don't be silly.
It's my present.
I found out the real value of my clock.
Those letters really got to you, didn't they?
Well, look at her.
Miss Emma Fairfax.
I knew she'd be beautiful.
It's what this is all about.
You know, one could almost become fond of you, Lovejoy.
What d'you mean?
Well, I don't know much about watermarks, but did they do Basildon Bond airmail in 1815?
You're joking?
Yes.
How long is this injunction going to hold us up?
Blake, we've got to be able to do something about it.
Now, it's not as bad as it seems.
We can continue to plan the pipeline.
We can get our geological surveys, we could-
Blake?
Um
- I'm sorry.
We can, um...
We can continue to get our easements, and our
- Um-
We can get our environmental impact report.
Something wrong?
Blake, what is it?
Are you all right?
I just...
I just felt a bit dizzy.
Blake.
Did something happen with Fallon when you went to see her?
- Something you didn't tell me about?
- No, no, of course not.
Is it Krystle?
I've noticed she hasn't been herself recently.
Krystle is having a difficult time.
But she'll pull through, she always has.
Yes, she's a real trouper.
Do these difficult times that she's been having have anything to do with the illness her doctor is treating her for?
Alexis, I would rather not discuss this with you.
Blake, I'm not blind.
And I don't want to pry, but I've noticed that you two seem to be having problems recently.
I said that I will not discuss this with you.
She really has hurt you, hasn't she?
Blake, you and I know each other too well to stand on ceremony.
Now, I want to help you.
I remember all the times you've helped me in the past.
No, you can't help me, you can go, though, because we're finished with this discussion.
I really hit a nerve this time, didn't I?
All right.
You don't look well, Blake.
I suggest you get yourself to a doctor as soon as possible.
And we can discuss the pipeline deal when you're feeling more civil.
Are you happy now, Steven?
Your big noises about fairness and compromise have just won an eminently unfair judgement against us.
We knew we'd probably lose the preliminary hearing.
- All that really matters is the trial.
- I didn't know we'd lose the hearing.
And we wouldn't have if we'd done things my way.
Maybe now you'll leave the law to the lawyers.
No way I'm leaving this to you, Adam, because I don't trust you.
If the Fallmonts are smart, and they are, they're gonna try to divide us to conquer us,
let's not forget we're on the same side.
Somebody wins, means the other guys have to lose.
I am sorry about that.
I'm sure you are, Fallmont.
Just remember, this was only the first round.
And when the knockout punch comes, and it will for our side, it'll be thanks to Mr. Lake here.
World-class environmental expert.
But you both already know that, don't you?
The last I heard, Mr. Lake was in the State Department.
That doesn't make him an expert in the oil business.
I think it does.
I've travelled a lot.
I've observed a lot.
I've seen what the careless use of the world's natural resources can lead to.
I read the paper you wrote for the Foreign Aff.airs Journal.
I liked your point of view on conservation.
- Well, thank you.
- That's good.
Then it goes without saying you'll like the way
Jonathan is gonna hack away at your environmental report.
I wouldn't go that far.
Sorry, again.
I thought you were becoming a fan of ours.
What I'm trying to say is I think you'll be pleased with what you find in the report.
Our pipeline is going to be a model for the future.
You find that funny?
It's an idiosyncrasy of mine, ever since I was a little kid.
I hear a lie and I laugh.
Are you calling me a liar?
I want an apology.
- I said apologise.
- Steven, don't.
We'll get him in court.
You just did your kid brother a big favour.
And we will get him.
We'll hang him from the top of Capitol Hill, that smug son of a-
That's a first, Adam.
You and I finally agree on something.
Good evening, Mr. Carrington.
Thank you, Gerard.
Krystle.
How was your day?
All right.
You look tired.
Well, I didn't feel very well, I thought I'd come home, take a nap before dinner.
What is it?
Uh...
I don't know.
- Do you want me to get you anything?
- No, no, no, I'll lie down for a while.
I'll be all right.
Gerard, would you help me get Mr. Carrington up to our room?
Of course, Mrs. Carrington.
Joel.
Do we have to do it this way?
I mean, there must be lots of ways for us to get what we want without...
- Without doing it like this.
- It's the only way.
It's the cleanest way.
And it's the best way.
But I kind of like the guy.
He's really very sweet.
You've done a very good job so far.
Don't get cold feet, when we're so close to where we wanna be.
If he divorces you, we've lost everything.
Now, just keep...
Keep giving him a little bit at a time and before you know it, it'll be all over.
How sick is he gonna get?
Well, you're giving him this special heart medicine.
And some doctors give it to patients to slow down hyperactive hearts.
But in this case, you're giving it to a man with a normal heart.
And?
Well, it slows down the heart gradually, until eventually...
Fade out.
The end.
When's that gonna be?
Soon.
Then I go to South America.
- You mean we go to South America.
- No, no, no.
Sweetheart, you have to stay here, you can't leave.
You've got to give the performance of your lifetime.
The bereaved widow.
Grief-stricken.
Heartbroken.
But that's just until probate's settled and after that, you can join me.
What about her?
The lady in the attic, the real Krystle?
Oh, her?
Don't worry about her, she's gonna...
Disappear.
- Yes, who is it?
Jonathan.
I have to talk to you.
Do you realise what time it is?
It's important.
Dominique, I hate the idea of this court fight coming between us.
Well, you should have thought of that before you took the job for the other side.
But I had to take it, it's important to me.
Well, you have your values and I have mine, Jonathan.
And I have to get some sleep.
Look, I'm not denying that our differences are serious.
I would say our differences are terminal.
I see.
So, what became of that woman I heard sing in Paris?
With compassion in her voice, compassion in her soul.
That woman has become a very successful businesswoman by tempering that compassion and learning to take very good care of herself.
So our relationship just dies.
Right?
But it can't, Dominique.
Oh, Jonathan, what relationship?
We had dinner once.
Jonathan, please, will you go?
Don't deny what you feel for me.
I can see it in your eyes.
I don't need anyone to tell me what I feel.
For an intelligent man, you certainly have misread what you see or what you think you see.
Have you ever longed to see Machu Picchu in the moonlight?
To glide down the Amazon?
To samba in Rio?
What are you talking about?
South America.
Would you like to go?
I don't understand.
I expect to be coming into a great deal of money very soon.
How does a trip like this sound to you?
- You'd let me out of here?
- Of course, we'd go together.
Would you like that?
Did you say something?
Yes.
- I can't hear you!
I said, yes.
I thought I was repulsive to you.
No.
Well, you certainly haven't acted like you liked me very much.
It's the circumstances.
Maybe if we'd met another way.
How do I know I can believe that?
That night you took me out dancing, I knew.
I thought, if we just could spend more time together out in the open, free.
Well, I'd like that.
What about your husband?
Well, you made it clear that I'll never see him again.
Can you live with that?
Hmm?
Yes.
If I can be with you.
Krystle, you have no idea how I've longed for you.
How much it's hurt me to see you hurt.
But I'll make it up to you.
We'll start all over again.
Just the two of us.
Tell me that's what you want.
That's what I want.
Nice try, Mrs. Carrington.
But your heart wasn't in it.
Better luck next time.
Better.
Keep rehearsing.
You do realise this damn thing could keep us in court for years?
- Good morning, Charles.
- Not if we handle things correctly.
Well, the Fallmonts would like nothing better than to make a big grandstand play in court.
Get their names in the newspapers, look like heroes.
We'd be impotent, we'd look like fools.
Father, I'll see this is taken care of, we will not lose one moment of construction time.
Good, good, Adam.
I'm counting on you.
Don't let me down.
There's one thing you could do to help.
Steven's causing a lot of interference.
I'd appreciate it if you can get him off my back.
Your brother happens to have very good instincts about things like this.
I want you to continue to work with him closely.
Frankly, it was his "good instincts" that got us into this mess to begin with.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
It's nothing.
I had a little scare last night, I had a dizzy spell.
I'll make an appointment with my doctor to get it checked out.
Adam, work with your brother.
You're both Carringtons.
And this family pulls together, now, remember that.
Of course.
No, no, I think for security reasons, it's best that you bring me that list in person.
Yeah.
Look, why don't you ring my secretary, let her know what plane you'll be on.
And I'll arrange to have you met at the airport.
Okay?
Yes, okay.
All right, goodbye.
See you tomorrow.
I honestly don't know how newlyweds are expected to stay away from each other for even one day.
- I find it unbearable.
- Mm.
- Can we have lunch?
- Darling, I wish I could.
I'll be right in the middle of a meeting.
- Oh, boring.
Can't you change it?
- Sorry, I can't.
Hold on.
Hello?
Uh
- No, I'll come to you.
Okay.
I have to go.
I'll be back in a minute.
Stay here.
Excuse me.
Michael, I found those names you wanted in New York.
- What are you doing here?
- Oh?
Didn't your husband tell you?
Are you the one he's working with?
Michael and I are meeting and working to free our homeland.
And his trip to New York, did he go and see you about your homeland?
What did Michael tell you?
I'm asking you.
Amanda, please, I do not wish to enter into any little quarrels you two may be having.
- I'm only-
- Darling, I-
I can't take you to lunch, but I've made a reservation for dinner.
Michael, how could you?
I have to go after her.
Amanda?
Amanda.
Amanda.
- Please listen to me.
- Why should I?
- You lied to me.
- No, I didn't.
You didn't say anything about working with her.
Look, don't you understand why I can't tell you any of my contacts?
It's not safe, for you or for them.
Now, for God's sake, Amanda, I've got nothing to hide from you.
How can you work with that woman?
How could you trust her after everything she did to prevent our marriage?
Except she didn't, did she?
Nothing, no one could have kept us apart.
Look, Elena has the contacts necessary for our cause.
She has risked her life.
She's also a leader of the underground.
Oh.
Is that what they're calling it nowadays?
And what is that supposed to mean?
Michael, I know what that woman is capable of to keep us apart.
You are my wife, Amanda.
That's all that counts.
Then stop seeing her.
I don't want you to have anything more to do with that woman.
Promise me, Michael, I insist.
I refuse.
All right.
But you'll regret that.
And that's a promise.
Dex, how nice.
You can take me to lunch.
I'm sorry, honey, I have an appointment with Blake.
Oh, well, doesn't matter.
You had a phone call a few minutes ago.
Caracas.
Caracas?
Who in Caracas?
Obviously someone who hasn't been keeping up on the comings and goings of Mrs. Dexter.
They asked for Alexis Carrington.
- Did they?
- Mm-hm.
I said that you weren't in.
Then click.
I got a hang-up.
Was it a woman's voice?
No, no, it was a man's.
Why?
Were you expecting a phone call from a woman in Venezuela?
Don't cross-examine me, darling.
I just asked a question.
Then you have no idea what any of this means.
No.
Alexis, who in Caracas wants you and who don't you want me to know anything about?
I don't know.
Now, aren't you late for your appointment?
You know how Blake hates to be kept waiting.
Uh-huh.
We can't begin construction on that pipeline because of the injunction.
- Is that clear?
- lnjunction or no injunction.
There's nothing to prevent you hiring a contractor and beginning to plan.
So why this delay in answering my bid?
Because your bid was one of a number of bids under consideration.
Until I have time to study all of them, you won't hear from me.
Not until then.
I don't think that's it, Blake.
I think you're using this injunction as an excuse to keep me out of this.
Well, you're wrong, I don't play that kind of ball.
Oh, don't you?
You've always resented me, Blake, admit that.
Ever since that first day when I took my father's place on your board and you realised that you couldn't fit me into your back pocket.
I'm one of the few people you can't shove around and you've never forgiven me for that.
- Are you finished?
- No.
Listen, Dexter lnternational can give you the best work at the best price.
We're miles ahead of the competition.
In that case, coming in here like a blowhard, acting like a-
Damn it.
What is it, Blake?
Nothing.
Nothing.
All right.
If you want that contract, you've got it.
Just make sure when the time comes that we're permitted to break ground that your company is ready to go to work.
You've got it.
And I want you to work very closely with Adam and Steven on this environmental issue.
I don't want you planning anything that'll get us into trouble.
Got that too.
Good.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I was just leaving.
Hah.
Thank you for everything.
I enjoyed the evening.
Really, it was wonderful.
It's not over yet.
Well, it's very, very late.
Have I tired you?
Look-
No, you look, we had a terrific dinner, a bottle of special wine, we danced very closely.
I told you that you were the most beautiful woman I'd ever known.
And I told you I was married.
But your husband's away,
- isn't he?
Yes, he is-
Steven.
Steven, I wanna talk to you.
What is it?
I was wondering, now that L.B. has moved to California with Jeff and Fallon, do you think we can-?
Do you think we could enrol Danny in a nursery school?
He needs to be with kids his own age.
Sure, enrol him in school so you can disappear with him again.
Is that all you think of me?
That's about it, yeah.
You know, if anyone else had suggested it, you would have thought it was a great idea.
Just because your playmate died, and your ex-wife married your brother is no reason to take it out on me.
So why don't you go back and do some more push-ups?
Better yet, why don't you find yourself a new boyfriend?
Then we all can relax.
For years, the Carringtons and the Colbys have made a profit in reckless disregard for the environment.
This proposed pipeline would interfere with natural grazing lands.
And increase the risk of oil spills which threatens us all with more pollution.
I've seen parts of this land that I love turn into a waste land of derricks and pumps thanks to the greed of Blake Carrington and Alexis Dexter.
Well, it's time those people realised they don't own this state, that they cannot put profits into their pockets at the expense of our quality of life.
The people still have a choice about the air they breathe, the water they drink, and the way that their land is used.
What are you doing here, Carrington?
You damned liar.
She invaded the room, her raven hair coifed demurely but her hazel eyes unable to hide the sex that smouldered within her.
It was her 16th birthday.
She paused, trembling on the brink of womanhood.
Then, brazen, she walked up to the handsomest man in the room and said:
'"You are my gift for the evening. "
Get your things together, senora.
Pronto.
Where are they taking me?
You are being released.
Two years early.
For good behaviour?
To have a friend with influence.
I never dreamed when I came to Caracas five years ago that I should end up rotting away in a prison.
But I survived.
And now I know I can make it through anything.
We will miss you, senora.
We don't often get people here like you.
Of course you don't.
Style is a rarity in this world.
Well, I can't say I shall miss this place.
But you've been very nice to me.
Thank you for all you've done.
The one you should thank is the rich Americano.
It was he who arranged your release.
What a book.
The sister of one of the world's most powerful women reveals the truth about her sister's background.
Where she really came from, how she got to be where she is today.
My darling, you really do look captivating.
The bestseller of the year by Cassandra Morell.
Oh, no.
They named me Cassandra, I hated it.
My name is Caress.
Now, about the title.
How does Sister Dearest sound?
Ha-ha-ha.
I'm in heaven.
The true story of Alexis Morell Carrington Colby Dexter, as told by her sister, Caress.
Who had five endless years with nothing to dwell on but dear Alexis.
Except for the final chapters, it's almost finished.
Would you excuse me for a few minutes?
Perhaps I could meet you in the bar downstairs.
Anything you say, Caress.
About a half an hour?
Perfect.
Hello, operator?
I'd like to make a long-distance call to Denver, Colorado.
Yes.
Person to person.
To Alexis Dexter.
No, on second thought, cancel that.
Get me the airport, will you?
Sometimes surprise is the best form of attack.
And then he said:
"All right.
It's yours."
I mean, the plum contract of the year, make that the decade for Dexter lnternational.
Darling, that's marvellous, I love it.
And I love you for being such a brilliant negotiator.
Well, he had me sweating there for a while.
So did you ever figure out who that was on the phone from Caracas?
No, probably some international operator's mistake.
Did Blake seem sort of strange to you?
How do you mean?
Well, when I saw him, he seemed rather off-centre.
Somewhat upset.
Do you think he's suspecting anything about Krystle and that doctor?
Well, if he is, he certainly didn't discuss it with me.
No, he was his usual captain-at-the-helm self.
Right up until the end and then he just seemed to cave in.
Cave in?
What do you mean?
Look, Alexis.
Are we here to celebrate my victory?
Or to discuss your ex-husband?
Darling, you said, "cave in."
That doesn't sound at all like Blake.
Well, the man was simply no match for my arguments.
Ha-ha.
Of course he wasn't.
But I do think something strange is going on with him.
And I mean to get to the bottom of it.
Alexis, do yourself a favour and stay out of what is clearly none of your business.
On the contrary, 25 percent of those oil leases make it my business.
And if Blake's personal life is a threat to his good judgement,
I've got to find out about it, Dex.
And I shall.
Oh.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Dexter.
Good afternoon, Gerard, is Mrs. Carrington in?
I'm afraid she's out, but I expect her back shortly.
Well, never mind, I really came to see Danny.
I brought a little gift for him.
- He's in the solarium.
- Oh.
And then, when the spaceship landed on the moon, the little boy astronaut got out and went bounce, bounce, bounce.
You are my darling boy, aren't you?
Hmm?
Oh, what a touching display of maternal affection.
Hello, Danny.
Do you want to play with the present that Alexis brought you?
- Yes.
- Good.
Go on upstairs then, you take him up.
I wanna talk to you, Sammy Jo.
- I'm really very busy now, Alexis.
- Well, aren't we all?
I just want to ask you a few questions about your Auntie Krystle and this new doctor of hers, Dr. Travers.
What goes on with Krystle and her doctor is none of my business.
Oh, but surely even you must be aware of how much time they spend together.
Hmm?
How much time do they spend together?
I'm not a detective, Alexis.
I don't keep track of these things.
Your sudden allegiance to your Auntie Krystle is almost as touching as your new-found devotion to your son.
And just as suspicious.
I want an answer, Samantha Josephine.
Where and how did Krystle meet this doctor?
I don't know.
I think one of her friends recommended him.
Which friend?
Anyone I know?
Look, why don't you ask her yourself?
You're being evasive, young lady.
I think that you know more than you're letting on.
Maybe Dr. Travers is a friend of yours.
- Is he?
- No.
Now get off my case, will you, lady?
But we can save ourselves millions if we can route the pipeline along the interstate.
There.
It will save us from cutting through the mountain by ourselves.
Well, fine.
All right, I'll look these over.
How do you feel, Father?
Did you get to the doctor?
Yes, and he told me the same thing he's been telling me all along.
I work too hard.
You know something, I think just this once, I'll take his advice.
I think I'll leave early and rest.
I can look these over at home.
Good idea.
Is there anything you'd like me to do?
Yes, you can keep an eye on things here for me and if anything comes up, take care of them.
You can count on me, Father.
Thank you, son.
I'll see you later at home.
What are you doing here?
This wine is dreadful, Krystle.
It has no body, no bouquet.
I said, what are you doing here?
The next time you order French wine and want to know about vintage, call me.
On second thought, send me a note.
I'm here to find out what's going on in this house.
Whatever is going on in this house ceased to be concern to you the day that you were thrown out of it.
Don't act high and mighty with me, Krystle.
People I love live in this house.
Now, I want to know what's transpiring between you and that doctor.
Why?
Jealous, Alexis?
Oh.
So you do admit that you're having an affair.
I admit nothing and I'm not gonna listen to any more of your crud.
"Crud?" You can't even manage a liaison with a modicum of class.
Well, it just goes to show you can take the girl out of Dayton, but you can't take Dayton out of the girl.
- Blake.
- Alexis.
Blake, what are you doing home?
I didn't feel very well, I decided to take the afternoon off.
Could you be kind enough to call the museum and make our apologies about that exhibition tonight?
Strange to have so much illness in a house that's getting so much medical attention.
Alexis was just leaving.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go up and rest.
All right, Krystle, now, just what in the hell is going on around here?
What do you mean?
Your flagrant affair under his roof is obviously ruining his health.
I mean, he's got circles under his eyes, he can't concentrate on his work, you're driving him crazy.
Alexis, this is my house, and Blake is my husband.
And I'm perfectly capable of taking care of him without your help, or a phoney concern.
There's nothing phoney about my concern, Krystle.
He's the father of my children.
You haven't heard the last from me about this.
Mrs. Gunnerson, is that Mr. Carrington's tray?
Oh, it's hot soup like you wanted.
This will make him feel much better.
I'll take it up to him.
Thank you.
Let me get the door for you, Mrs. Carrington.
Thank you.
Well, Mrs. Gunnerson swears her soup will cure anything.
Thank you.
There.
You know something, Blake?
Maybe this bug of yours is a blessing in disguise.
It'll give me a chance to show you how much I care for you.
And maybe if we spend more time together, we could get close again.
There's nothing I would like more than that.
Let's just make up our minds that that's the way it's gonna be.
You know, I'm really not very hungry.
Well, Mrs. Gunnerson will be very angry with me if I don't get you to eat every last drop of this.
Hello, Adam.
I'm sorry I'm late, but I was working half the night on this injunction.
Have you come down with something?
No.
I'm just tired.
I'm tired of waiting for you to make good on your promises.
Claudia, I realise that you're angry with me because you think I'm not on your side.
But I am.
And I love you very, very much.
What is this?
Adam, I don't want another necklace.
- I don't want another ring-
- Open it.
Go on.
Open it.
"l.O.U. Blaisdel-Lankershim One."
What is this?
Blake is sick.
He left work early, and gave me free run of the office.
I've begun the process of turning your oil well back over to you.
How?
By laying the legal groundwork to take over the entire company.
So that everything Blake has will be ours.
Adam, those are your dreams.
They're not mine.
I wish you luck with your plans, but I can't leave my dreams in your hands any longer.
I'm going to Oklahoma tomorrow.
Oklahoma?
To do a title search.
It's time that I started fighting my own battles.
Help.
Help me.
What's the matter?
It hurts so much.
- What hurts?
- Here.
It's my appendix.
Does it hurt here?
How about here?
Has it ever flared up before?
Yes, please, get me to a doctor, please.
All right, look, I'll get the car and I'll bring it around.
You rest, don't move.
Right side, appendix.
Left side, lie.
What is this?
Where did this bottle come from?
How should I know?
I'll tell you where it came from, it came from you.
I've seen you with this bottle before.
Now, what is it?
I don't know what you're talking about.
- I've never seen that bottle before.
- Blake is sick.
Did you give him something to make him sick?
What?
My God, Sammy Jo.
You're getting paranoid, you know that?
You must have a guilty conscience.
-Oh, yeah!
-Hook them horns, baby!
We are on our way to the biggest party of the world.
Yeah!
Red River Rock 'n' Roll Request Line.
This is Stretch.
That's for Glen.
And could you tell the girls at Mesquite High just to leave him alone?
Got it, and I believe it.
Glen is off-limits now.
This is Stretch on an open request line on K-OKLA in Burkburnett, Texas,
Red River Rock 'n' Roll, from the tip-top of the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex.
Heck, let's give Stretch a call and see what she says.
-What kind of name is Stretch?
-No idea.
Red River Rock 'n' Roll Request Line.
This is Stretch.
Yo, Stretch!
It's the one and only Buzz.
And Rick the Prick!
And from all the senior boys at Wheeler High to all the senior girls, who are so stuck-up, boy, you're on the road to nowhere.
No, you mean, "We're on the road to nowhere."
No, baby.
We're on the road to Texas-OU Weekend in Dallas!
You're on the road to nowhere!
Hook them horns, baby!
Real funny, guys.
Okay, you wanna hang up now?
Tying up the line.
Hey, come on.
-No way, baby!
-We got a lot more requests!
Hey, check it out, dude.
Let's play a little chicken with the farmer here.
-Come on, baby!
Come on!
-Come on!
Come on, man.
Come on!
-Hot damn!
-Hook them horns!
That was great!
That was great!
You got that, babe?
Hot line?
You better stick with us, baby!
Yeah.
Later, sports.
Just hang up, okay?
No way!
Hook them horns!
-L.G!
-Damn it, I'm trying, darling.
Don't call me darling, damn it.
It's 8:11, Texas-time, on a Friday night.
I know nobody's listening because y'all are all zooming, but I got a shot of hot rock 'n' roll for you anyway.
K-OKLA, Red River Rock 'n' Roll Request.
What it is, Stretch?
This is the Buzz again.
Not again.
Hang it up, lame-o.
Go call your mother.
Yeah, yeah, talk dirty.
But this is for Rick the Prick.
He wants to hear Bright Lights, Big Titties.
Wrong.
I don't want to hear it.
I want to see it!
Bright lights, big titties!
L.G?
L.G., get in here, please.
What the fuck?
Are you crazy?
Back up, pig fucker!
Come on.
Hurry up.
Get out of here!
Oh, my God!
They gotta hang up.
Step on it!
-Shit!
What the fuck?
-Come on, hurry up!
Hang up!
-What the hell is that?
-Look, it's some kind of geek.
-The geek's got a...
-Come on.
What is that?
-Shit!
-Come on.
Get out of here.
-Where'd he come from?
-I don't believe this shit!
Just keep driving.
Come on.
-Hey, let's go.
Come on.
-What the hell is that?
-Go on!
What's he doing?
-God damn it!
What's he got there?
Jesus Christ!
-What?
-Come on.
What is that?
-I don't believe this shit!
-Come on!
You can do it!
Come on!
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
-Holy shit!
-Come on, get out of here!
He's got a fucking chainsaw!
-Sounds like a buzz saw.
-Buzz saw?
Hey, hang up, man.
Hang up.
Hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up!
Get him.
Shoot the bastard.
Get him.
Shit!
Fuck!
Shoot that motherfucker, yeah!
Shit!
Keep back!
God!
Son of a bitch!
Shit!
Missed us, assholes.
What?
It just cut off.
Did you do that?
What happened?
It's like super feedback.
Just put the underwoofer across the overflapper.
I don't know.
Just went dead air.
-I want the license plate.
-No problem.
All right, now, ease up here.
You go get your pictures.
Watch out, Bob.
All right, keep the tension on that line.
Hey, loosen that chain.
We need some slack.
Easy.
Easy.
You, get out of there!
Three-zero.
Cowboy, get away from there.
This is an accident scene.
The area is restricted.
-Not gonna tell you...
-It's all right.
It's all right, Wendell.
Lieutenant Enright, sir.
We heard you might be headed this way.
Did you come over for the big game?
You know why I'm here.
Yes, sir, something about the chainsaw killers, your brother's kids killed.
But that was 14 years ago, sir, way down in South Texas.
Now, these are other kids.
This is just an accident.
Just a couple of wild punks out raising hell.
Yep.
One of those boys is so wild sawed his own head off going 90 mile per hour.
Hell.
Hell's exactly what they raised.
No, sir, that information's off the record.
You know, sir, this is always a pretty hairy weekend for Dallas.
Whole lot of folks come to town and don't give a damn about football.
You know, they just wanna go blood crazy for a few and riot.
You know what "riot" means.
You were a Ranger.
I can't hardly keep them down by law, and if...
If you go around promoting this chainsaw...
Try to speak plain.
Saves time.
I have authority from the DA's office to put you right back on the next plane to Amarillo.
Well, you just do that, son.
I'd like to see that authority.
All right, Lieutenant Enright, what's your deal?
All right.
I'm gonna ask some questions.
Put it in the press.
Get it in the news.
Any information about this accident and maybe some witnesses.
Yes, sir, I know some old boys at the paper.
We'll get your story out for you.
Brazos.
Brazos.
Brazos!
Remember the Alamo, cowboy.
I won!
Come on!
Asshole.
You need a witness?
I'm a witness.
This Mercedes?
I think I was talking to those kids when it happened.
No way was that an accident.
-You saw it.
-No, but I heard it.
You can listen.
It's here on tape.
Regulations.
We gotta record all the call-ins.
End of the night, we wipe the tapes, but I kept this one just 'cause...
It just got to me.
We got professionals working on this...
I didn't know what I'd heard, but I read your story.
-What you're looking for is on this tape.
-...so don't fool with it.
You can slow it down now.
You're just a joke in this morning's paper.
"Cowboy chases chainsaws 14 years.
"Dallas police refuse comment."
Like you're, you know, hung up on something crazy.
But I believe you.
I might be the only believer you got.
-'Cause it's right here.
-What is?
Right on here, those kids getting killed.
Now, this is evidence, sort of, right?
Yeah, it's time for you to go home.
-No, wait a minute, wait a minute.
-Come on.
Look, I came here because I thought I could help you.
I deejay this dumb show on K-OKLA up in Burkburnett, but people listen to me all across North Texas.
Now, I could put you on the radio, get people to believe you, get you some help.
You're gonna get in my way.
-Don't you get in my way.
-No, I'm already right in the middle of this.
This is my chance to stop playing head-banging music and do something real.
Well, I don't need anybody to stand with me, all right?
You can't do it alone.
I got a perfect willingness to die.
That gives me a moral on this bunch of mad dogs.
They live on fear.
They thrive on it.
I ain't got no fear left.
I ain't got no fear, Lord.
-Hardass.
-Hardass?
Me?
Well, maybe a semi-hardass, but I got a soft heart.
Looky.
-Built you a little fry house.
-L.G!
What, darling?
Oh, L.G.
Okay, everybody, hush up.
Listen up, y'all.
The Texas-OU Chili Cook-off champion is from Norman, Oklahoma?
No.
Waco, Texas?
Tulsa?
Nope.
-Pardon me.
-Austin?
He's Dallas' favorite caterer.
I think he's kind of cute.
The Last Round-up Rolling Grill chef,
Drayton Sawyer!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Way to go, Drayton!
It's the second year in a row.
This year, Drayton, you've got to tell the secret of that fabulously tasty chili!
No secret.
It's the meat.
Don't skimp on the meat.
I got a real good eye for prime meat.
Runs in the family.
Oops!
Oops!
It's one of those hard-shell peppercorns.
I gotta say, I love this town.
This town loves prime meat!
So there's the big story.
Texas clobbers Oklahoma in chili.
This is Stretch, your fearless reporter, live from Dallas.
Now, be sure to watch your drinking and driving on this wild and woolly Texas-OU Weekend.
This is Stretch, on K-OKLA...
Cut-Rite.
No, C.L., I ain't seen Fletcher.
Well, last Friday.
Well, hell, he's on the road, then.
Well, don't believe me, then.
Fine.
C.L.
No.
I'll be with you in just a minute, sir.
Now, you're getting as mean as a sting bat, C.L...
No, hell, don't call back.
No, don't you call back.
I got a business here, and Fletcher ain't none of my business.
Damn!
What can I do you for?
Well, don't you wanna test them?
There's gas in them.
Get them suckers a time or two.
Oh, my kid banana.
Damn, what is he doing?
Now, this is very hard to believe.
I'd like you to play that tape, missy.
Come all the way up here to Burkburnett.
No shit!
Yeah.
Oh, you wanna hear it now.
I wanna hear it on the radio.
On your show.
Uh-uh.
I don't think it'd be legal to do that.
FCC regulations, those things.
Well, you just figure out how to do it and do it.
You bend the rules.
I don't know.
-Why?
-Because the killers are here.
Kill sites have been clustered all over Northeast Texas the last two years.
The laws, they shy away from piecing it together as murder.
They call it accidents, disappearances.
You got that last slaughter on tape.
You play it on the radio.
Maybe then, the laws will stop trying to shut me up and start helping me.
Besides, it'll give you something real to do.
You said you were gonna do this alone.
I need your help, missy.
Well, you can call me Stretch, Mr. Enright.
Well, now, you can call me Lefty.
It's mighty nice doing business with you.
-Thanks.
-All right.
You have a nice day, now.
You, too.
Number one again!
Drayton did it again.
Number one.
Number one!
The Sawyers are number one!
Number one.
So here's a special request we're doing this afternoon and tonight.
You steady listeners know we're playing this every hour.
This is for Lefty.
Hog fucker!
Son of a bitch!
Last Round-up Rolling Grill.
We're still number one.
I told you, boys, and I told you.
Don't call on this phone.
Now, damn it, get off.
What?
What's on the radio?
Now, don't bullshit me.
I can't...
I won't...
All right, what station?
This ain't no joke, boy?
Then I'm tuning it in.
Hog fucker!
Son of a bitch!
You two nap-haired idiots.
You've done it again!
You coon shits!
You fudge-packers!
You'll be the death of me yet!
Missed us, assholes.
K-OKLA.
Come on, Lefty.
Where are you?
This concludes the broadcast day for K-OKLA in Burkburnett, Texas,
Red River Rock 'n' Roll.
In New York, it's 1:00 a.m., still fun city.
In LA, 10:00 at night, party time.
But deep in the heart of Texas, it's 12:00 midnight.
Ain't nothing going on.
It's another cussing caller.
Your little ass is gonna be in big trouble over that tape, girl.
Nope.
Sure got a lot of complaints, darling.
L.G., it was a request, right?
It's listed in the logs as a request.
People complain about the request every night, right?
Uh-huh.
Wanna go for coffee at Big State?
Nope.
I guess you're waiting on this guy, Lefty?
L.G.
Night, L.G.
Good night.
God damn it!
Shit!
K-OKLA, this is Stretch.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello, Lefty?
L.G?
Lefty?
Lefty?
I wanna buy some radio-ad time.
Are you fucking crazy?
We are closed!
Off the air till tomorrow.
You'll have to just come back.
No, but...
But, yeah, but...
Whoa...
So this is radio land, huh?
The infinite turnover?
The waves through the ether fuzz roll on forever.
Can't close that.
Hi, I know what you're thinking.
"This is weird.
Hope I can handle it."
You know,
you're my fave.
Me and Bubba, my little brother, we listen to you every night.
Music is my life.
You know, you're my fave, but I get too embarrassed to phone in my request.
It's too disembodied, you know?
But
Now that we're here in flesh and blood,
I could maybe make a request, and it'd still count, huh?
Sure.
Well, what about
Iron Butterfly?
You know, like In-A-Vida-Da-Gadda, Baby?
Oh, it's heavy!
You know,
I've never been to a radio station before.
Do you think you could do me a tour, huh?
Tour?
Tour.
Sure, sure.
But seriously quick, and it ends at the exit sign.
Oh, boy!
Okay, yeah, sure!
Okay, your tour.
Here's your tour.
Here's your tour.
Here's a lamp.
Yeah, lamp.
Here's a typewriter.
-Rubber man.
-Rubber man.
I like him.
Armadillo.
Here's Mr. Shark.
Oh, Mr. Shark!
-Here's some flowers.
-Flowers.
-Rolodex.
-Rolodex.
Here's a lamp.
And there's the exit sign.
Tour's over.
"E-X-I-T.
"Exit."
-Good night.
-Oh!
Good night!
Good night!
Good night.
Good night!
Good night.
Hey, what about my request?
You know, that Lefty-request record that you honked out today?
I love that!
Let's see.
What was it, anyway?
The Rambo III soundtrack?
Gonna play it again?
Sure would like it.
Hey, maybe I could get a copy, and you could autograph it.
To a far-out fan!
-What's in here?
-Record vault.
Oh, where you keep the golden oldies?
And maybe...
Maybe the new music's in...
Not me, you dumbass!
Get the girl!
Get the girl!
Ow, ow, ow!
He dented my plate!
My brain is burning!
Nam flashback!
Nam flashback!
Leatherface, you bitch, I'll...
Look what you did to my Sonny Bono wig-do.
Oh, God damn, I can't believe it!
You gonna have to buy me a new plate cover!
You gonna have to buy me a new plate cover, Leatherface.
He's gonna send me back to the VA Hospital with this dent in my plate.
Well, at least he didn't mess me up.
Dog will hunt.
Get that bitch, Leatherface.
Get that bitch!
Dog will hunt.
Go away!
Shit.
Humble Pie!
Hurry up, Leatherface.
Hurry up.
Get that bitch!
Go away!
Music is my life!
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
Stretch, darling, you know the door's unlocked?
Hey!
What the shit?
Hey!
Lick my plate, you dog dick!
What the fuck you think you're doing in here, you crazy-looking little son of a bitch?
Get out of here!
Time for incoming mail!
Ho Chi Minh!
A-one and a-two and a-three!
Go, you little bitch!
Go away!
Leave me alone!
No, no, no, no!
God, no, please don't!
Incoming mail!
No, no, no!
No, no, no, please, God, no!
No, no, no, please, God!
Please, God, no!
No!
No, no, no, please, God!
Stop it!
God, no!
No, no, please, God!
Are you mad at me?
How mad at me are you?
You're not really mad at me.
How good are you?
Huh?
Get that bitch, Leatherface!
Get that bitch!
How good are you?
Oh...
Really?
Are you really, really good?
Are you really good?
You're really good.
You're the best.
Oh, no.
No!
No!
Please don't kill me!
No, God!
No, God!
No, please, God!
No, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Leatherface.
Did you get her, Bubba?
Did you get that bitch?
She was my fave, but she knew.
And now, nobody knows.
Look what you did to my plate, you bitch!
You got her?
Did you get her good?
Slap me five.
I got one, too.
A bonus body!
Look at that beef.
Help me get it out of here.
Whoa...
Giddyup!
No, they'll get away.
No, no, they'll get away.
They can't get away.
God damn it, Lefty.
You're late.
Damn it, Lefty.
No!
Stretch!
Lefty?
Stretch!
Hold on!
Grab onto something.
Hold onto it.
Lefty, they came!
Where were you?
I had to do it.
Damn, I used you, girl.
I'm here now.
Grab hold of this.
Grab hold of this, now.
Don't you cry, little sister.
I'm here now.
Come on, I'm here now.
You can get it.
Come on, now.
You got it.
Come on.
Come on!
Grab it!
Oh, my God.
Oh, Lord, help me beat this stranger that walks beside me, that takes away my strength.
Lord, you show me the end.
Show me what I fear so I don't fear it no more.
It's the devil's playground.
I'm bringing it down!
Down to hell!
Bring it all down!
Bring it all down!
I hate to say it, but that hillbilly hog you boys got earlier is the tops tonight.
That's mine!
Mine!
Not Bubba's.
Me!
Me!
Bust it up!
Wanna go to the movies?
No crowds.
Everybody's at the football parties.
Tonight's a washout.
Biggest meat-eater weekend of the month, and we're gonna lose money on it.
Damn it all!
Maybe we just ought to quit.
Oh, yeah?
Kiss my plate, Mr. Big Shot.
Maybe you forgot.
This chromedome bankrolled this food business.
No lucky goof with a machete, no head wound.
No head wound, no fancy rolling grill a-go-go.
Ain't no fool.
Kiss it.
Don't forget it.
Peel that pig and slice him thick.
-That's my sweet pea.
-Get them hogs on the grill.
Big, big pre-game brunch tomorrow means a ton of croissant sandwiches.
Oh, I love this town.
Hey, you nitwit, get back in here and get that grill going.
No.
No.
No good.
No good.
No good.
Come on, Bubba.
Cook's out here, and he's chewing ass like it was steak.
"You gotta run for that money now.
"Chase that dollar.
Gotta go fast to catch it."
You dumb baboozer.
Too dumb to even close the door.
I'm tired of kicking your asses.
What are you doing?
You trying to hide something?
Get that eyeball pâté working.
Hey, you coon shit, where are you going?
We need the club sandwiches...
Help.
Help me.
Please.
Please, help me.
Can you help me get out of here?
Can you help me get out of here?
What is it?
Put that down.
Put that down.
Put that down.
What is that?
Is it wet?
It's wet.
Put it down.
My darling.
Darling?
Darling?
Don't be scared, darling.
Oh, no, L.G.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
L.G!
Oh, my God!
L.G., they got you, too?
Oh, L.G!
We gotta get y'all loose.
I guess I'm falling apart on you, honey.
No.
No.
Shit.
L.G.,
I love you.
So he says,
"Hey, get me those lawyers.
Legal meat."
Legal meat, yeah!
Legal meat, yeah!
Bubba, you idiot!
Get your ass over here.
-You fucked up again.
-You fucked up again.
He says, "Hey, get me those lawyers.
"Legal meat, y'all."
Fuck me in the left eye!
Valuable kill-time wasted running down them cooped-up pencil necks, and not a good chop on the whole bunch.
I pick the vittles.
Get it?
-I.
Me.
Nobody but...
-I pick the vittles, I.
-Bubba, you hull wreckage!
-Me.
Nobody but...
Busted again, huh?
That's the main support beam.
Fuck, you idiots!
You both will pay!
Both of you...
You're both...
Look what your brother's done now.
You coon shit.
You cut the main support beam.
And this is what happens.
Of course this is what happens.
That big brute!
Dirty meat don't cut it.
Family standards only require the best meat in town.
More money lost.
I never, never, never get a break.
Work, work night and day, presenting myself to the people, selling, selling.
You pair of prima donnas fooling around here and listening to the radio all day and sawing down your own house.
Take it all down!
Bring it all down!
Bury the devil!
May the Lord have mercy on our souls!
Get that thing out of here.
Maybe it cracked the main butane tank.
It's up there.
Go look at it.
Taxes.
Taxes.
Damn property taxes fuck up everything.
Crooks don't pay taxes.
Politicians don't.
Movie stars don't.
It's the little guy that can't make a dime.
He pays the taxes.
Small businessman gets it in the ass every time.
I ought to quit.
Right, it's junk.
Quit.
Dump this cook show.
Sell off this turkey.
It's time.
It's in the air.
It's what the public wants.
I don't wanna hear that again.
It's Nam Land!
What the hell was that?
I don't know, boy.
It looked like a big, big fireball.
Nam Land.
Napalm.
Fire in the hole.
That's the main butane tank up there, Bubba.
Go look at it.
Get your butt moving, boy.
Go up there and look at it.
Go look at it.
-I'll kick you in the ass again.
-Not now.
It's Nam Land.
-It's a hit.
It's a bang.
It's a smash.
-Shut him up, Bubba.
Did you see it?
Well, did you?
Didn't you?
Did you?
Didn't you?
Go check it out, boy.
-Nam Land!
-Oh, shut up!
I told you to go check it out, boy, before I start kicking your ass.
Some kind of crazy booger just skipped through here.
No, a booger?
How big?
A big crazy booger.
Let's haul butt, bro.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Franklin.
Don't you cry, my brother.
I'm here now.
I'm here now.
They can't do this.
They can't do this!
They can't do this!
They can't do this!
I'll take you back to hell!
I'll take you to hell!
All right, all right!
Let's talk about it.
Okay.
What, are you pissed-off?
What about me?
Listen, this is not gonna work out.
I'm trying to be open with you.
It's nobody's fault.
I just can't do this.
Let me go.
Let me go.
What the hell's going on here?
Bubba, you nap-haired idiot.
Get out of here.
Who's this?
I get it.
Are you the saboteur that's fucking up our house?
Trying to put me out of business?
Thousands of dollars lost.
You got that kind of money?
No!
It's the deejay.
My fave.
That dirty thing?
Told me you boys got her.
Well, yeah.
Leatherface killed her once already tonight.
But look, she's red-faced.
Bubba's been playing with her.
Bubba likes her.
Bubba's got a girlfriend.
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girl...
Is that what this is, Bubba?
The old cock-and-cunt swindle, huh?
S-C-E-X.
Sex.
And you had to find out about it, didn't you?
You just couldn't leave it alone.
If you wanted to know about it so bad, why didn't you ask me?
You wanna know about it?
You wanna know about it?
Ask me.
Ask me.
It's a swindle, that's all.
So don't get mixed up in it.
Help me.
Help me.
Help me.
Please, help me.
Please.
Help me.
Please, help me.
All right, Miss Priss, cut that out.
Leave him alone, damn it!
Bubba, you were supposed to finish her.
Finish her now.
-Burn her like a rat.
-Finish her.
-Burn her like a rat!
-Finish her now.
Burn her like a rat!
Burn her like a rat, rat, rat!
Burn her like a rat!
Burn her like a rat, rat, rat!
-Burn her like a rat!
-Finish her now!
-Finish her now, Bubba!
-Burn her like a rat!
-Finish her!
-Finish her.
Finish her.
Give me that.
Turn traitor for a piece of tail.
You got one choice, boy, sex or the saw.
Sex is, well, nobody knows.
But the saw, the saw is family.
-The saw is family.
-Wait till Granddad hears about this.
Take her away.
-She's in the garbage now.
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.
-A-one and a-two and three!
No!
Dinnertime, damn it!
Let's go.
Eat and run.
Eat and run.
There's a lot of hungry football fans to feed.
Hurry it up.
Grandpa likes to go fast.
He always did.
Come on.
Come on.
Time eats money.
Those damn coon shits are the weight of the family.
I stoop my shoulders taking care of my younger brothers.
It squashed the young years out of my life like a can of cheese whip.
I wouldn't wish this rotten life off on a one-eyed ferret with mange.
You're the first girl Bubba's brought home to dinner.
This is a real special occasion.
Grandpa sure looks forward to meeting you.
He's 137 years old but still as fast as Jesse James, so don't you worry none.
Here comes Grandpa now.
God bless you, Grandpa.
Oh, it's playtime!
It's dinnertime!
Your little boys have some left here for you.
Yes, no, yes, no!
Yes, we do!
We love you!
We love you!
Okay, now.
Take it easy, now.
Take it easy with Grandpa.
-That's right.
That's right.
-Get him over here easy, now.
-That's right.
Okay.
-Come on, you boys.
Easy with Grandpa, now.
-Oh, easy with Grandpa.
-No!
No!
Oh, please, no.
Don't rattle him like that, damn it!
You're balling up his shit.
No!
Grandpa's strict liquid diet keeps him as fresh as a rose.
Every spring, the Atlas Rendering Company used to throw a big barbecue for Grandpa.
Oh, he was the master.
He was the one and only.
He showed us all the business.
We was raised in meat.
But then after the glory, here comes the shame.
Atlas went for automation.
The electrified cages, the cold-steel chutes, the air-powered head hammers.
That drove Grandpa crazy, seeing things done like that.
Let me go!
Let me go!
No, no, that's all right.
That's all right.
It'll be over soon.
Get the hammer.
Get the hammer.
The crunching and the grinding, he just couldn't stand it, no way.
So that was all she wrote.
One morning, Grandpa just quit going in.
It was the shame.
It was the shame.
The shame.
There's more work to do.
Let's get on with it.
Right.
Let's get on with it.
Bingo!
Give me that.
Get that tub over there in a hurry.
Do I have to do every damn thing around here?
You just sit tight.
Bubba, she's ready.
Bring her on down.
No!
-Oh, no!
-Bring her on down, damn it!
No!
No!
Bring her on down!
No!
No, no, no!
No, no, no!
Help me!
No, no, no!
Let me go!
You gotta let me go!
Let me go!
Please, help me!
-This will be one you won't forget.
-Please, help me!
It's a real honor.
Grandpa, he's a one-hitter.
And it's just like going home.
Please help me!
-No!
No!
No, God!
-No, no.
Help me!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Help me, please!
Please, help me!
Let's go see Grandpa, boy.
No, don't!
-No!
No, God!
-Come on.
Bring the bitch down.
No!
No!
No!
No, no, let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
No!
No!
No, no, no!
No!
Here come the judge.
Here come the judge.
No!
Now, don't ruin Grandpa's favorite rug.
Be careful of the splatter.
You gotta be careful of the splatter.
Oh, Great-grandma in chainsaw heaven...
No!
No!
God!
...please don't hoodoo the boy.
Hey, Grandpa, here's the big boy.
Look what Bubba brought you.
Hey, Grandpa, Bubba's got something to show you here.
Look, a Slurpee booty.
-Hit her, Grandpa.
-Come on, Grandpa.
Let's see you do it.
Now, come on.
Come on, Grandpa.
You're the best.
-Hit her, Grandpa.
Hit her!
-Come on.
Hit her, Grandpa.
Come on, I'm telling you...
Remember those thieves?
Come on.
One-hitter.
-Come on, Grandpa.
-Hit her.
Hit her, Grandpa.
Come on, you won't miss her.
-Come on, Grandpa.
-Come on, Grandpa.
Hit her.
Hit that bitch.
Hit that bitch.
Come on, Grandpa.
Come on, Grandpa.
You can do it.
You're the best.
Come on, there, Grandpa.
Come on, there, Grandpa.
Come on, Grandpa.
You can do it.
You're the best.
Hit her, Grandpa.
Come on, Grandpa.
You're the best, Grandpa.
Hit that bitch, Grandpa.
Hit her.
Come on, Grandpa.
Hit her.
You are, Grandpa.
You're the best.
Come on, Grandpa.
Hit her.
You are, Grandpa.
You're the best.
Yeah!
That's good, isn't it, Grandpa?
Grandpa!
-Attaboy, Grandpa.
-Hit that bitch, now, Grandpa.
-Come on, Grandpa.
You can do it.
-Get her now, Grandpa.
You can do it.
Come on, Grandpa.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Hit that bitch.
Hit that bitch!
Come on, Grandpa!
Come on, Grandpa!
Oh, Grandpa, let's get on with it.
All right!
Slurpee-booty time!
Oh, shut up!
What the hell's going on here?
Boys, boys, boys.
What the hell's going on here?
Is that the American way of entering a man's home, singing like that?
Oh, I get it.
The old pressure game, huh?
Boys, you never should have been doing this.
Who sent you?
Those sissies over at Del-Mar Catering?
That chickenshit burrito-man bunch?
Well, I don't care, you hear?
Yeah, that's right.
It's a dog-eat-dog world.
And from where I sit, there just ain't enough damn dogs.
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the damn kitchen.
How much, huh?
Let's make a deal right here.
Real cash money.
Just you and me, huh?
I don't care who sent you.
I'm the Lord of the Harvest.
Who's that?
Some new health-food bunch?
Come on.
Come on.
Is there any money in it, you wanna know?
Yeah, right here.
How much, huh?
How much?
-Lefty.
-Sister.
Lefty!
Brazos!
Run, sister.
Run!
Small businessman that always, always, always gets it in the ass!
Sure...
Sure took care of my hems.
Saved a trip to the hospital.
Looks...
Looks bad.
Sure burned my beads bad on that one.
Maybe it's time to just shut down.
Time to shut down the show, yeah.
Yeah, pull the plug.
Come here, nubbins.
Where...
Where's that old "Fuck you, Charlie"?
That little "Just in case, baby"?
Where'd you put it?
Yeah, there it is.
Man...
Man builds a good, sturdy trade by hooking and crooking.
And then, kerplooey!
The gods just kick him right in the balls.
Oh, no, not this time.
No!
No!
I got the last laugh right here.
Going down, now!
Going down!
Going down, now!
Here I come, you hog bitch!
You hog bitch!
Dead end, girl.
Dead end now.
Dead-end city.
Look at my face.
Look.
Look!
It's like death eating a cracker, isn't it?
No!
Get away from her!
Get away!
Don't touch her!
No!
Grandma!
No!
Grandma!
Grandma!
Grandma!
Grandma!
You killed her, you hog bitch!
Die!
-Oh, yeah!
-Hook them horns, baby!
We are on our way to the biggest party of the world.
Yeah!
Red River Rock 'n' Roll Request Line.
This is Stretch.
That's for Glen.
And could you tell the girls at Mesquite High just to leave him alone?
Got it, and I believe it.
Glen is off-limits now.
This is Stretch on an open request line on K-OKLA in Burkburnett, Texas,
Red River Rock 'n' Roll, from the tip-top of the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex.
Heck, let's give Stretch a call and see what she says.
-What kind of name is Stretch?
-No idea.
Red River Rock 'n' Roll Request Line.
This is Stretch.
Yo, Stretch!
It's the one and only Buzz.
And Rick the Prick!
And from all the senior boys at Wheeler High to all the senior girls, who are so stuck-up, boy, you're on the road to nowhere.
No, you mean, "We're on the road to nowhere."
No, baby.
We're on the road to Texas-OU Weekend in Dallas!
You're on the road to nowhere!
Hook them horns, baby!
Real funny, guys.
Okay, you wanna hang up now?
Tying up the line.
Hey, come on.
-No way, baby!
-We got a lot more requests!
Hey, check it out, dude.
Let's play a little chicken with the farmer here.
-Come on, baby!
Come on!
-Come on!
Come on, man.
Come on!
-Hot damn!
-Hook them horns!
That was great!
That was great!
You got that, babe?
Hot line?
You better stick with us, baby!
Yeah.
Later, sports.
Just hang up, okay?
No way!
Hook them horns!
-L.G!
-Damn it, I'm trying, darling.
Don't call me darling, damn it.
It's 8:11, Texas-time, on a Friday night.
I know nobody's listening because y'all are all zooming, but I got a shot of hot rock 'n' roll for you anyway.
K-OKLA, Red River Rock 'n' Roll Request.
What it is, Stretch?
This is the Buzz again.
Not again.
Hang it up, lame-o.
Go call your mother.
Yeah, yeah, talk dirty.
But this is for Rick the Prick.
He wants to hear Bright Lights, Big Titties.
Wrong.
I don't want to hear it.
I want to see it!
Bright lights, big titties!
L.G?
L.G., get in here, please.
What the fuck?
Are you crazy?
Back up, pig fucker!
Come on.
Hurry up.
Get out of here!
Oh, my God!
They gotta hang up.
Step on it!
-Shit!
What the fuck?
-Come on, hurry up!
Hang up!
-What the hell is that?
-Look, it's some kind of geek.
-The geek's got a...
-Come on.
What is that?
-Shit!
-Come on.
Get out of here.
-Where'd he come from?
-I don't believe this shit!
Just keep driving.
Come on.
-Hey, let's go.
Come on.
-What the hell is that?
-Go on!
What's he doing?
-God damn it!
What's he got there?
Jesus Christ!
-What?
-Come on.
What is that?
-I don't believe this shit!
-Come on!
You can do it!
Come on!
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
-Holy shit!
-Come on, get out of here!
He's got a fucking chainsaw!
-Sounds like a buzz saw.
-Buzz saw?
Hey, hang up, man.
Hang up.
Hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up!
Get him.
Shoot the bastard.
Get him.
Shit!
Fuck!
Shoot that motherfucker, yeah!
Shit!
Keep back!
God!
Son of a bitch!
Shit!
Missed us, assholes.
What?
It just cut off.
Did you do that?
What happened?
It's like super feedback.
Just put the underwoofer across the overflapper.
I don't know.
Just went dead air.
-I want the license plate.
-No problem.
All right, now, ease up here.
You go get your pictures.
Watch out, Bob.
All right, keep the tension on that line.
Hey, loosen that chain.
We need some slack.
Easy.
Easy.
You, get out of there!
Three-zero.
Cowboy, get away from there.
This is an accident scene.
The area is restricted.
-Not gonna tell you...
-It's all right.
It's all right, Wendell.
Lieutenant Enright, sir.
We heard you might be headed this way.
Did you come over for the big game?
You know why I'm here.
Yes, sir, something about the chainsaw killers, your brother's kids killed.
But that was 14 years ago, sir, way down in South Texas.
Now, these are other kids.
This is just an accident.
Just a couple of wild punks out raising hell.
Yep.
One of those boys is so wild sawed his own head off going 90 mile per hour.
Hell.
Hell's exactly what they raised.
No, sir, that information's off the record.
You know, sir, this is always a pretty hairy weekend for Dallas.
Whole lot of folks come to town and don't give a damn about football.
You know, they just wanna go blood crazy for a few and riot.
You know what "riot" means.
You were a Ranger.
I can't hardly keep them down by law, and if...
If you go around promoting this chainsaw...
Try to speak plain.
Saves time.
I have authority from the DA's office to put you right back on the next plane to Amarillo.
Well, you just do that, son.
I'd like to see that authority.
All right, Lieutenant Enright, what's your deal?
All right.
I'm gonna ask some questions.
Put it in the press.
Get it in the news.
Any information about this accident and maybe some witnesses.
Yes, sir, I know some old boys at the paper.
We'll get your story out for you.
Brazos.
Brazos.
Brazos!
Remember the Alamo, cowboy.
I won!
Come on!
Asshole.
You need a witness?
I'm a witness.
This Mercedes?
I think I was talking to those kids when it happened.
No way was that an accident.
-You saw it.
-No, but I heard it.
You can listen.
It's here on tape.
Regulations.
We gotta record all the call-ins.
End of the night, we wipe the tapes, but I kept this one just 'cause...
It just got to me.
We got professionals working on this...
I didn't know what I'd heard, but I read your story.
-What you're looking for is on this tape.
-...so don't fool with it.
You can slow it down now.
You're just a joke in this morning's paper.
"Cowboy chases chainsaws 14 years.
"Dallas police refuse comment."
Like you're, you know, hung up on something crazy.
But I believe you.
I might be the only believer you got.
-'Cause it's right here.
-What is?
Right on here, those kids getting killed.
Now, this is evidence, sort of, right?
Yeah, it's time for you to go home.
-No, wait a minute, wait a minute.
-Come on.
Look, I came here because I thought I could help you.
I deejay this dumb show on K-OKLA up in Burkburnett, but people listen to me all across North Texas.
Now, I could put you on the radio, get people to believe you, get you some help.
You're gonna get in my way.
-Don't you get in my way.
-No, I'm already right in the middle of this.
This is my chance to stop playing head-banging music and do something real.
Well, I don't need anybody to stand with me, all right?
You can't do it alone.
I got a perfect willingness to die.
That gives me a moral on this bunch of mad dogs.
They live on fear.
They thrive on it.
I ain't got no fear left.
I ain't got no fear, Lord.
-Hardass.
-Hardass?
Me?
Well, maybe a semi-hardass, but I got a soft heart.
Looky.
-Built you a little fry house.
-L.G!
What, darling?
Oh, L.G.
Okay, everybody, hush up.
Listen up, y'all.
The Texas-OU Chili Cook-off champion is from Norman, Oklahoma?
No.
Waco, Texas?
Tulsa?
Nope.
-Pardon me.
-Austin?
He's Dallas' favorite caterer.
I think he's kind of cute.
The Last Round-up Rolling Grill chef,
Drayton Sawyer!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Way to go, Drayton!
It's the second year in a row.
This year, Drayton, you've got to tell the secret of that fabulously tasty chili!
No secret.
It's the meat.
Don't skimp on the meat.
I got a real good eye for prime meat.
Runs in the family.
Oops!
Oops!
It's one of those hard-shell peppercorns.
I gotta say, I love this town.
This town loves prime meat!
So there's the big story.
Texas clobbers Oklahoma in chili.
This is Stretch, your fearless reporter, live from Dallas.
Now, be sure to watch your drinking and driving on this wild and woolly Texas-OU Weekend.
This is Stretch, on K-OKLA...
Cut-Rite.
No, C.L., I ain't seen Fletcher.
Well, last Friday.
Well, hell, he's on the road, then.
Well, don't believe me, then.
Fine.
C.L.
No.
I'll be with you in just a minute, sir.
Now, you're getting as mean as a sting bat, C.L...
No, hell, don't call back.
No, don't you call back.
I got a business here, and Fletcher ain't none of my business.
Damn!
What can I do you for?
Well, don't you wanna test them?
There's gas in them.
Get them suckers a time or two.
Oh, my kid banana.
Damn, what is he doing?
Now, this is very hard to believe.
I'd like you to play that tape, missy.
Come all the way up here to Burkburnett.
No shit!
Yeah.
Oh, you wanna hear it now.
I wanna hear it on the radio.
On your show.
Uh-uh.
I don't think it'd be legal to do that.
FCC regulations, those things.
Well, you just figure out how to do it and do it.
You bend the rules.
I don't know.
-Why?
-Because the killers are here.
Kill sites have been clustered all over Northeast Texas the last two years.
The laws, they shy away from piecing it together as murder.
They call it accidents, disappearances.
You got that last slaughter on tape.
You play it on the radio.
Maybe then, the laws will stop trying to shut me up and start helping me.
Besides, it'll give you something real to do.
You said you were gonna do this alone.
I need your help, missy.
Well, you can call me Stretch, Mr. Enright.
Well, now, you can call me Lefty.
It's mighty nice doing business with you.
-Thanks.
-All right.
You have a nice day, now.
You, too.
Number one again!
Drayton did it again.
Number one.
Number one!
The Sawyers are number one!
Number one.
So here's a special request we're doing this afternoon and tonight.
You steady listeners know we're playing this every hour.
This is for Lefty.
Hog fucker!
Son of a bitch!
Last Round-up Rolling Grill.
We're still number one.
I told you, boys, and I told you.
Don't call on this phone.
Now, damn it, get off.
What?
What's on the radio?
Now, don't bullshit me.
I can't...
I won't...
All right, what station?
This ain't no joke, boy?
Then I'm tuning it in.
Hog fucker!
Son of a bitch!
You two nap-haired idiots.
You've done it again!
You coon shits!
You fudge-packers!
You'll be the death of me yet!
Missed us, assholes.
K-OKLA.
Come on, Lefty.
Where are you?
This concludes the broadcast day for K-OKLA in Burkburnett, Texas,
Red River Rock 'n' Roll.
In New York, it's 1:00 a.m., still fun city.
In LA, 10:00 at night, party time.
But deep in the heart of Texas, it's 12:00 midnight.
Ain't nothing going on.
It's another cussing caller.
Your little ass is gonna be in big trouble over that tape, girl.
Nope.
Sure got a lot of complaints, darling.
L.G., it was a request, right?
It's listed in the logs as a request.
People complain about the request every night, right?
Uh-huh.
Wanna go for coffee at Big State?
Nope.
I guess you're waiting on this guy, Lefty?
L.G.
Night, L.G.
Good night.
God damn it!
Shit!
K-OKLA, this is Stretch.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello, Lefty?
L.G?
Lefty?
Lefty?
I wanna buy some radio-ad time.
Are you fucking crazy?
We are closed!
Off the air till tomorrow.
You'll have to just come back.
No, but...
But, yeah, but...
Whoa...
So this is radio land, huh?
The infinite turnover?
The waves through the ether fuzz roll on forever.
Can't close that.
Hi, I know what you're thinking.
"This is weird.
Hope I can handle it."
You know,
you're my fave.
Me and Bubba, my little brother, we listen to you every night.
Music is my life.
You know, you're my fave, but I get too embarrassed to phone in my request.
It's too disembodied, you know?
But
Now that we're here in flesh and blood,
I could maybe make a request, and it'd still count, huh?
Sure.
Well, what about
Iron Butterfly?
You know, like In-A-Vida-Da-Gadda, Baby?
Oh, it's heavy!
You know,
I've never been to a radio station before.
Do you think you could do me a tour, huh?
Tour?
Tour.
Sure, sure.
But seriously quick, and it ends at the exit sign.
Oh, boy!
Okay, yeah, sure!
Okay, your tour.
Here's your tour.
Here's your tour.
Here's a lamp.
Yeah, lamp.
Here's a typewriter.
-Rubber man.
-Rubber man.
I like him.
Armadillo.
Here's Mr. Shark.
Oh, Mr. Shark!
-Here's some flowers.
-Flowers.
-Rolodex.
-Rolodex.
Here's a lamp.
And there's the exit sign.
Tour's over.
"E-X-I-T.
"Exit."
-Good night.
-Oh!
Good night!
Good night!
Good night.
Good night!
Good night.
Hey, what about my request?
You know, that Lefty-request record that you honked out today?
I love that!
Let's see.
What was it, anyway?
The Rambo III soundtrack?
Gonna play it again?
Sure would like it.
Hey, maybe I could get a copy, and you could autograph it.
To a far-out fan!
-What's in here?
-Record vault.
Oh, where you keep the golden oldies?
And maybe...
Maybe the new music's in...
Not me, you dumbass!
Get the girl!
Get the girl!
Ow, ow, ow!
He dented my plate!
My brain is burning!
Nam flashback!
Nam flashback!
Leatherface, you bitch, I'll...
Look what you did to my Sonny Bono wig-do.
Oh, God damn, I can't believe it!
You gonna have to buy me a new plate cover!
You gonna have to buy me a new plate cover, Leatherface.
He's gonna send me back to the VA Hospital with this dent in my plate.
Well, at least he didn't mess me up.
Dog will hunt.
Get that bitch, Leatherface.
Get that bitch!
Dog will hunt.
Go away!
Shit.
Humble Pie!
Hurry up, Leatherface.
Hurry up.
Get that bitch!
Go away!
Music is my life!
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
Stretch, darling, you know the door's unlocked?
Hey!
What the shit?
Hey!
Lick my plate, you dog dick!
What the fuck you think you're doing in here, you crazy-looking little son of a bitch?
Get out of here!
Time for incoming mail!
Ho Chi Minh!
A-one and a-two and a-three!
Go, you little bitch!
Go away!
Leave me alone!
No, no, no, no!
God, no, please don't!
Incoming mail!
No, no, no!
No, no, no, please, God, no!
No, no, no, please, God!
Please, God, no!
No!
No, no, no, please, God!
Stop it!
God, no!
No, no, please, God!
Are you mad at me?
How mad at me are you?
You're not really mad at me.
How good are you?
Huh?
Get that bitch, Leatherface!
Get that bitch!
How good are you?
Oh...
Really?
Are you really, really good?
Are you really good?
You're really good.
You're the best.
Oh, no.
No!
No!
Please don't kill me!
No, God!
No, God!
No, please, God!
No, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Leatherface.
Did you get her, Bubba?
Did you get that bitch?
She was my fave, but she knew.
And now, nobody knows.
Look what you did to my plate, you bitch!
You got her?
Did you get her good?
Slap me five.
I got one, too.
A bonus body!
Look at that beef.
Help me get it out of here.
Whoa...
Giddyup!
No, they'll get away.
No, no, they'll get away.
They can't get away.
God damn it, Lefty.
You're late.
Damn it, Lefty.
No!
Stretch!
Lefty?
Stretch!
Hold on!
Grab onto something.
Hold onto it.
Lefty, they came!
Where were you?
I had to do it.
Damn, I used you, girl.
I'm here now.
Grab hold of this.
Grab hold of this, now.
Don't you cry, little sister.
I'm here now.
Come on, I'm here now.
You can get it.
Come on, now.
You got it.
Come on.
Come on!
Grab it!
Oh, my God.
Oh, Lord, help me beat this stranger that walks beside me, that takes away my strength.
Lord, you show me the end.
Show me what I fear so I don't fear it no more.
It's the devil's playground.
I'm bringing it down!
Down to hell!
Bring it all down!
Bring it all down!
I hate to say it, but that hillbilly hog you boys got earlier is the tops tonight.
That's mine!
Mine!
Not Bubba's.
Me!
Me!
Bust it up!
Wanna go to the movies?
No crowds.
Everybody's at the football parties.
Tonight's a washout.
Biggest meat-eater weekend of the month, and we're gonna lose money on it.
Damn it all!
Maybe we just ought to quit.
Oh, yeah?
Kiss my plate, Mr. Big Shot.
Maybe you forgot.
This chromedome bankrolled this food business.
No lucky goof with a machete, no head wound.
No head wound, no fancy rolling grill a-go-go.
Ain't no fool.
Kiss it.
Don't forget it.
Peel that pig and slice him thick.
-That's my sweet pea.
-Get them hogs on the grill.
Big, big pre-game brunch tomorrow means a ton of croissant sandwiches.
Oh, I love this town.
Hey, you nitwit, get back in here and get that grill going.
No.
No.
No good.
No good.
No good.
Come on, Bubba.
Cook's out here, and he's chewing ass like it was steak.
"You gotta run for that money now.
"Chase that dollar.
Gotta go fast to catch it."
You dumb baboozer.
Too dumb to even close the door.
I'm tired of kicking your asses.
What are you doing?
You trying to hide something?
Get that eyeball pâté working.
Hey, you coon shit, where are you going?
We need the club sandwiches...
Help.
Help me.
Please.
Please, help me.
Can you help me get out of here?
Can you help me get out of here?
What is it?
Put that down.
Put that down.
Put that down.
What is that?
Is it wet?
It's wet.
Put it down.
My darling.
Darling?
Darling?
Don't be scared, darling.
Oh, no, L.G.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
L.G!
Oh, my God!
L.G., they got you, too?
Oh, L.G!
We gotta get y'all loose.
I guess I'm falling apart on you, honey.
No.
No.
Shit.
L.G.,
I love you.
So he says,
"Hey, get me those lawyers.
Legal meat."
Legal meat, yeah!
Legal meat, yeah!
Bubba, you idiot!
Get your ass over here.
-You fucked up again.
-You fucked up again.
He says, "Hey, get me those lawyers.
"Legal meat, y'all."
Fuck me in the left eye!
Valuable kill-time wasted running down them cooped-up pencil necks, and not a good chop on the whole bunch.
I pick the vittles.
Get it?
-I.
Me.
Nobody but...
-I pick the vittles, I.
-Bubba, you hull wreckage!
-Me.
Nobody but...
Busted again, huh?
That's the main support beam.
Fuck, you idiots!
You both will pay!
Both of you...
You're both...
Look what your brother's done now.
You coon shit.
You cut the main support beam.
And this is what happens.
Of course this is what happens.
That big brute!
Dirty meat don't cut it.
Family standards only require the best meat in town.
More money lost.
I never, never, never get a break.
Work, work night and day, presenting myself to the people, selling, selling.
You pair of prima donnas fooling around here and listening to the radio all day and sawing down your own house.
Take it all down!
Bring it all down!
Bury the devil!
May the Lord have mercy on our souls!
Get that thing out of here.
Maybe it cracked the main butane tank.
It's up there.
Go look at it.
Taxes.
Taxes.
Damn property taxes fuck up everything.
Crooks don't pay taxes.
Politicians don't.
Movie stars don't.
It's the little guy that can't make a dime.
He pays the taxes.
Small businessman gets it in the ass every time.
I ought to quit.
Right, it's junk.
Quit.
Dump this cook show.
Sell off this turkey.
It's time.
It's in the air.
It's what the public wants.
I don't wanna hear that again.
It's Nam Land!
What the hell was that?
I don't know, boy.
It looked like a big, big fireball.
Nam Land.
Napalm.
Fire in the hole.
That's the main butane tank up there, Bubba.
Go look at it.
Get your butt moving, boy.
Go up there and look at it.
Go look at it.
-I'll kick you in the ass again.
-Not now.
It's Nam Land.
-It's a hit.
It's a bang.
It's a smash.
-Shut him up, Bubba.
Did you see it?
Well, did you?
Didn't you?
Did you?
Didn't you?
Go check it out, boy.
-Nam Land!
-Oh, shut up!
I told you to go check it out, boy, before I start kicking your ass.
Some kind of crazy booger just skipped through here.
No, a booger?
How big?
A big crazy booger.
Let's haul butt, bro.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Franklin.
Don't you cry, my brother.
I'm here now.
I'm here now.
They can't do this.
They can't do this!
They can't do this!
They can't do this!
I'll take you back to hell!
I'll take you to hell!
All right, all right!
Let's talk about it.
Okay.
What, are you pissed-off?
What about me?
Listen, this is not gonna work out.
I'm trying to be open with you.
It's nobody's fault.
I just can't do this.
Let me go.
Let me go.
What the hell's going on here?
Bubba, you nap-haired idiot.
Get out of here.
Who's this?
I get it.
Are you the saboteur that's fucking up our house?
Trying to put me out of business?
Thousands of dollars lost.
You got that kind of money?
No!
It's the deejay.
My fave.
That dirty thing?
Told me you boys got her.
Well, yeah.
Leatherface killed her once already tonight.
But look, she's red-faced.
Bubba's been playing with her.
Bubba likes her.
Bubba's got a girlfriend.
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girl...
Is that what this is, Bubba?
The old cock-and-cunt swindle, huh?
S-C-E-X.
Sex.
And you had to find out about it, didn't you?
You just couldn't leave it alone.
If you wanted to know about it so bad, why didn't you ask me?
You wanna know about it?
You wanna know about it?
Ask me.
Ask me.
It's a swindle, that's all.
So don't get mixed up in it.
Help me.
Help me.
Help me.
Please, help me.
Please.
Help me.
Please, help me.
All right, Miss Priss, cut that out.
Leave him alone, damn it!
Bubba, you were supposed to finish her.
Finish her now.
-Burn her like a rat.
-Finish her.
-Burn her like a rat!
-Finish her now.
Burn her like a rat!
Burn her like a rat, rat, rat!
Burn her like a rat!
Burn her like a rat, rat, rat!
-Burn her like a rat!
-Finish her now!
-Finish her now, Bubba!
-Burn her like a rat!
-Finish her!
-Finish her.
Finish her.
Give me that.
Turn traitor for a piece of tail.
You got one choice, boy, sex or the saw.
Sex is, well, nobody knows.
But the saw, the saw is family.
-The saw is family.
-Wait till Granddad hears about this.
Take her away.
-She's in the garbage now.
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.
-A-one and a-two and three!
No!
Dinnertime, damn it!
Let's go.
Eat and run.
Eat and run.
There's a lot of hungry football fans to feed.
Hurry it up.
Grandpa likes to go fast.
He always did.
Come on.
Come on.
Time eats money.
Those damn coon shits are the weight of the family.
I stoop my shoulders taking care of my younger brothers.
It squashed the young years out of my life like a can of cheese whip.
I wouldn't wish this rotten life off on a one-eyed ferret with mange.
You're the first girl Bubba's brought home to dinner.
This is a real special occasion.
Grandpa sure looks forward to meeting you.
He's 137 years old but still as fast as Jesse James, so don't you worry none.
Here comes Grandpa now.
God bless you, Grandpa.
Oh, it's playtime!
It's dinnertime!
Your little boys have some left here for you.
Yes, no, yes, no!
Yes, we do!
We love you!
We love you!
Okay, now.
Take it easy, now.
Take it easy with Grandpa.
-That's right.
That's right.
-Get him over here easy, now.
-That's right.
Okay.
-Come on, you boys.
Easy with Grandpa, now.
-Oh, easy with Grandpa.
-No!
No!
Oh, please, no.
Don't rattle him like that, damn it!
You're balling up his shit.
No!
Grandpa's strict liquid diet keeps him as fresh as a rose.
Every spring, the Atlas Rendering Company used to throw a big barbecue for Grandpa.
Oh, he was the master.
He was the one and only.
He showed us all the business.
We was raised in meat.
But then after the glory, here comes the shame.
Atlas went for automation.
The electrified cages, the cold-steel chutes, the air-powered head hammers.
That drove Grandpa crazy, seeing things done like that.
Let me go!
Let me go!
No, no, that's all right.
That's all right.
It'll be over soon.
Get the hammer.
Get the hammer.
The crunching and the grinding, he just couldn't stand it, no way.
So that was all she wrote.
One morning, Grandpa just quit going in.
It was the shame.
It was the shame.
The shame.
There's more work to do.
Let's get on with it.
Right.
Let's get on with it.
Bingo!
Give me that.
Get that tub over there in a hurry.
Do I have to do every damn thing around here?
You just sit tight.
Bubba, she's ready.
Bring her on down.
No!
-Oh, no!
-Bring her on down, damn it!
No!
No!
Bring her on down!
No!
No, no, no!
No, no, no!
Help me!
No, no, no!
Let me go!
You gotta let me go!
Let me go!
Please, help me!
-This will be one you won't forget.
-Please, help me!
It's a real honor.
Grandpa, he's a one-hitter.
And it's just like going home.
Please help me!
-No!
No!
No, God!
-No, no.
Help me!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Help me, please!
Please, help me!
Let's go see Grandpa, boy.
No, don't!
-No!
No, God!
-Come on.
Bring the bitch down.
No!
No!
No!
No, no, let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
No!
No!
No, no, no!
No!
Here come the judge.
Here come the judge.
No!
Now, don't ruin Grandpa's favorite rug.
Be careful of the splatter.
You gotta be careful of the splatter.
Oh, Great-grandma in chainsaw heaven...
No!
No!
God!
...please don't hoodoo the boy.
Hey, Grandpa, here's the big boy.
Look what Bubba brought you.
Hey, Grandpa, Bubba's got something to show you here.
Look, a Slurpee booty.
-Hit her, Grandpa.
-Come on, Grandpa.
Let's see you do it.
Now, come on.
Come on, Grandpa.
You're the best.
-Hit her, Grandpa.
Hit her!
-Come on.
Hit her, Grandpa.
Come on, I'm telling you...
Remember those thieves?
Come on.
One-hitter.
-Come on, Grandpa.
-Hit her.
Hit her, Grandpa.
Come on, you won't miss her.
-Come on, Grandpa.
-Come on, Grandpa.
Hit her.
Hit that bitch.
Hit that bitch.
Come on, Grandpa.
Come on, Grandpa.
You can do it.
You're the best.
Come on, there, Grandpa.
Come on, there, Grandpa.
Come on, Grandpa.
You can do it.
You're the best.
Hit her, Grandpa.
Come on, Grandpa.
You're the best, Grandpa.
Hit that bitch, Grandpa.
Hit her.
Come on, Grandpa.
Hit her.
You are, Grandpa.
You're the best.
Come on, Grandpa.
Hit her.
You are, Grandpa.
You're the best.
Yeah!
That's good, isn't it, Grandpa?
Grandpa!
-Attaboy, Grandpa.
-Hit that bitch, now, Grandpa.
-Come on, Grandpa.
You can do it.
-Get her now, Grandpa.
You can do it.
Come on, Grandpa.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Hit that bitch.
Hit that bitch!
Come on, Grandpa!
Come on, Grandpa!
Oh, Grandpa, let's get on with it.
All right!
Slurpee-booty time!
Oh, shut up!
What the hell's going on here?
Boys, boys, boys.
What the hell's going on here?
Is that the American way of entering a man's home, singing like that?
Oh, I get it.
The old pressure game, huh?
Boys, you never should have been doing this.
Who sent you?
Those sissies over at Del-Mar Catering?
That chickenshit burrito-man bunch?
Well, I don't care, you hear?
Yeah, that's right.
It's a dog-eat-dog world.
And from where I sit, there just ain't enough damn dogs.
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the damn kitchen.
How much, huh?
Let's make a deal right here.
Real cash money.
Just you and me, huh?
I don't care who sent you.
I'm the Lord of the Harvest.
Who's that?
Some new health-food bunch?
Come on.
Come on.
Is there any money in it, you wanna know?
Yeah, right here.
How much, huh?
How much?
-Lefty.
-Sister.
Lefty!
Brazos!
Run, sister.
Run!
Small businessman that always, always, always gets it in the ass!
Sure...
Sure took care of my hems.
Saved a trip to the hospital.
Looks...
Looks bad.
Sure burned my beads bad on that one.
Maybe it's time to just shut down.
Time to shut down the show, yeah.
Yeah, pull the plug.
Come here, nubbins.
Where...
Where's that old "Fuck you, Charlie"?
That little "Just in case, baby"?
Where'd you put it?
Yeah, there it is.
Man...
Man builds a good, sturdy trade by hooking and crooking.
And then, kerplooey!
The gods just kick him right in the balls.
Oh, no, not this time.
No!
No!
I got the last laugh right here.
Going down, now!
Going down!
Going down, now!
Here I come, you hog bitch!
You hog bitch!
Dead end, girl.
Dead end now.
Dead-end city.
Look at my face.
Look.
Look!
It's like death eating a cracker, isn't it?
No!
Get away from her!
Get away!
Don't touch her!
No!
Grandma!
No!
Grandma!
Grandma!
Grandma!
Grandma!
You killed her, you hog bitch!
Die!

Just went dead air.
You go get some pictures...
Watch out...
All right, keep the tension on that line.
Hey, loosen that chain.
We need some slack.
Easy!
Easy!
You, get out of there!
Cowboy, get away from there.
This is an accident scene.
The area is restricted.
Not gonna tell you agai...
It's all... it's all right, Wendell.
Lieutenant Enright, sir.
We heard you might be headed this way.
Uh, did you come over for the big game?
You know why I'm here.
Yes, sir, something about the chainsaw killers.
Your brother's kids killed...
But that was 14 years ago, sir, way down in South Texas.
Now, these are other kids.
This is just an accident.
Just a couple of wild punks, out raising hell.
Yup.
One of those boys so wild, sawed his own head off going 90 mile per hour.
Hell.
Hell's exactly what they raised.
Uh, no, sir.
That information's off the record.
You know, sir, this is always a pretty hairy weekend for Dallas.
Whole lot of folks come to town, don't give a damn about football.
You know, they just want to go blood crazy for a few... riot.
You know what riot means, you were a ranger.
Can't hardly keep 'em down by law, and if...
If you go around promoting' this chainsaw...
Try to speak plain.
Saves time.
I have authority from the D.A.'s office to put you right back on the next plane to Amarillo.
Well, you just do that, son.
I'd like to see that authority.
All right, Lieutenant Enright, what's your deal?
All right.
I'm gonna ask some questions.
Put it in the press.
Get it in the news.
Any information about this accident, and maybe, uh, some witnesses.
Yes, sir, I, uh...
I know some old boys at the paper.
We'll get your story out for ya.
Brazos.
Bra-zos.
Bra-zos!
Remember the Alamo, cowboy.
Look, Ma, a whore!
Wanna fuck!
Asshole.
You need a witness?
I'm a witness.
Uh, this Mercedes?
I think I was talkin' to those kids when it happened.
- No way was that an accident.
- You saw it.
No, but I heard it.
You can listen.
It's here on tape.
- Oh, shit.
- Come on!
Whoo!
Regulations.
We gotta record all the call-ins.
End of the night we wipe the tapes, but I kept this one...
Just 'cause... it just got to me.
We got professionals...
I didn't know exactly what I'd heard, but I read your story, and I think what you're lookin' for is on this tape.
You can just not fool with it.
You can slow it down now.
Um, you're just a joke in this morning's paper.
"Cowboy Chases Chainsaws 14 Years."
"Dallas Police Refuse Comment."
Like you're... you know, hung up on somethin' crazy.
But I believe you.
I might be the only believer you got.
'Cause it's right here.
What is?
Right on here, those kids gettin' killed.
Now, this is evidence, sort of, right?
Yeah, it's time for you to go home.
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Look.
I came here because I could help you.
I deejay this dumb show on K-OKLA up in Burkburnett...
But people listen to me all across North Texas...
Now, I could put you on the radio.
Get people to believe you.
Get you some help.
You're gonna get in my way.
Don't you get in my way.
No, I'm already right in the middle of this.
This is my chance to stop playin' head-bangin' music and do something real.
Well, I don't need anybody to stand with me.
- All right?
- You can't do it alone.
I got a perfect willingness to die.
That gives me a moral on this bunch of mad dogs.
They live on fear.
They thrive on it.
I ain't got no fear left.
Adios.
I ain't got no fear, Lord.
- Hard ass.
- Hard ass?

Well, maybe a semihard ass, but I got a soft heart.

This year, Drayton, you've got to tell the secret of that fabulously tasty chili!
No secret.
It's the meat.
Don't skimp on the meat.
I-I got a real good eye for prime meat.
Runs in the family.
Whoop, whoop.
One of those hard-shell peppercorns.
I gotta say, I love this town.
This town loves prime meat!
So, there's the big story.
Texas clobbers Oklahoma in chili.
This is Stretch, your fearless reporter, live from Dallas.
Now, be sure to watch your drinkin' and drivin'... on this wild and woolly Texas/O. U. weekend.
This is Stretch, on K-OKLA Ra...
Cut-Rite.
Naw, 'Ceil, I ain't seen Fletcher.
Well, last Friday.
Well, hell, he's on the road, then.
Well, don't believe me, then.
Fine.
'Ceil.
No.
I'll be with you in just a minute, sir.
Now, you're as good and mean as a sting bat, 'Ceil.
No, hell, don't call back.
No, don't you call back.
I got a business here, and Fletcher ain't none of my business.
Damn!
What can I do you for?
But don't you want to test 'em?
There's gas in them.
Give them suckers a time or two.
Oh, my achin' banana.
Damn, what is he doing?
Now, this... is very hard to believe.
I'd like you to play that tape, Missy.
Come all the way up here to Burkburnett, no shit!
Yeah.
- Oh, you wanna hear it now.
- I wanna hear it on the radio.
- On your show.
- Uh-uh.
I don't think it'd be legal to do that.
F.C.C. regulations...
those things.
Well, you just figure out how to do it, and do it.
You bend the rules, I don't know.
- Why?
- Because the killers are here.
Kill sites have been clustered all over Northeast Texas the last two years.
The laws, they shy away from piecing' it together as murder.
They call it accidents, disappearances.
You got that last slaughter on tape.
You play it on the radio.
Maybe then the laws will stop trying to shut me up and start helping me.
Besides, it'll give you something real to do.
You said you were gonna do this alone.
I need your help, Missy.
Well, you can call me Stretch, Mr. Enright.
Well, now, you can call me Lefty.
It's mighty nice doin' business with you.
- Thanks.
- All right.
You have a nice day, now.
You, too.
Number one again!
Drayton did it again.
Number one.
♪ Number one, the Sawyers are number one ♪
Number one.
K-O-K-L-A
So here's a special request we're doing this afternoon and tonight.
You steady listeners know we're playing this every hour.
This is for Lefty.
Hog fucker!
Son of a bitch!
Last Round-up Rolling Grill.
We're still number one.
I told you, boys, and I told you.
Don't call on this phone.
Now damn it, get off.
What?
What's on the radio?
Ah, now, don't bullshit me.
I can't...
I won't...
All right, what station?
This ain't no joke, boy?
Then, I'm tuning' it in.
You-you nap-haired idiot.
You-you've done it again!
Ah, you coon shits.
You-you fudge packers,
You'll be the death of me yet!
Missed us, assholes.
Buzz!
- K-OKLA.
- Oh, God!
Come on, Lefty.
Where are you?
This concludes the broadcast day for K-OKLA, in Burkburnett, Texas,
Red River rock 'n' roll.
In New York, it's 1:00 a.m., still, fun city.
In L.A., 10:00 at night, party time.
But deep in the heart of Texas, It's 12:00 midnight.
Ain't nothin' goin' on.
That's another cussing caller.
Your little ass gonna be in big trouble over that tape, girl.
Nope.
Sure got a lot of complaints, darlin'.
L.G., it was a request, right?
It's listed in the logs as a request.
People complain about the request every night, right?
Uh-huh.
Want to go for coffee at the Big Steak?
Nope.
Huh, I guess you're waitin' on this guy Lefty?

Whoa!
So, this is radioland, huh?
The infinite turtle?

R-roar-r-r!
Can't close that.
Hi, I know what you're thinking.
"This is weird.
Hopin' I can handle it."
You know?
You're my fave.
Me and 'Bubba', my little brother, we listen to you every night.
Music is my life.
You know, you're my fave.
But I get too embarrassed to phone in my request.
It's too disembodied, you know?
But, uh... ahh!
Now that we're here in flesh and blood,
I could maybe make a request, and it'd still count, huh?
Uh-huh, sure.
Mm-hmm.
Well, what about, uh...
Iron Butterfly?
You know, like uh, "In-A-Vida-Da-Gadda, Baby"?
Oh, it's heavy!
You know, I've never been... to a r-r-radio station before.
Do you think you could do me a tour, huh?
Tour?
All right.
Tour?
Sure.
Mm-hmm, sure.
But seriously quick.
And it ends at the exit sign.
Oh, boy!
Okay.
Yeah, sure!
Okay, your tour.
Here's your tour.

Not Bubba's.

Oh, bust it up!
Wanna go to the movies?
No crowds.
Everybody's at the football parties.
Huh?
Tonight's a washout.
Biggest meat-eater weekend of the month, and we're gonna lose money on it.
Damn it all.
Maybe just ought to quit.
Oh, yeah?
Kiss my plate, Mr. Big Shot.
Maybe you forgot.
This chromedome bankrolled this little business.
No lucky gook with a machete, no head wound.
No head wound, no fancy rolling grill and go-go.
Ain't no fool.
Kiss it.
Don't forget it.
Peel that pig and slice him thick.
- That's my sweet pea.
- Get them hogs on the grill.
Big pre-game brunch tomorrow means a ton of croissant sandwiches.
Oh, I love this town.
Hey, you nitwit.
Get back in here and get this grill goin'.
'"Oh!

No.
No good.

The Cook's out here, and he's chewin' ass like it was steak!
You gotta run for that money now.
Chase that dollar.
Go fast to catch it.
You dumb baboozer.
Too dumb to even close...
I'm tired of kicking your asses.
What are you doing?
You trying to hide something?
Well, get that eyeball pate workin'.

Legal meat, yeah!
Bubba, you idiot!
Get your ass over here.
- You fucked up again.
- You fucked up again.
He says, "Hey, you get me those lawyers.
Legal meat, y'all."
Our valuable kill time wasted runnin' down them coked-up pencil necks.
And not a good chop on the whole bunch.
I pick the vittles.
Get it?
I. Me.
Nobody but me.
Bubba, you home wrecking'...
Busted again, huh?
That's the main support beam...
Fuck, you idiots!
You're fucked...
Look what your brother's clone now.
You coon shit.
You cut the main support beam.
And this is what happens.
Of course this is what happens.
That pig's ruined!
Dirty meat don't cut it.
Family standards only require the best meat in town.
More money lost.
I never, never, never get a break.
Work.
Work night and day...
Presenting myself to the people, selling, selling.
You pair of prima Donnas fool around here and listen to the radio all day...
And... sawing down your own house.
Shake it all out!
Bring it all down!
Bury the devil!
May the Lord have mercy on our souls.
Get that thing out of here.
Maybe it cracked the main butane tank.
It's up there.
Go look at it.
Taxes, taxes.
Damn property taxes fuck up everything.
Crooks don't pay taxes.
Politicians don't.
Movie stars don't.
It's the little guy that can't make a dime.
He pays the taxes.
Small businessman gets it in the ass every time.
I ought to quit.
Right, it's, "junk, quit, dump this, cook show."
Sell off this turkey.
It's time.
It's in the air.
It's what the public wants.
I don't wanna hear that again.
It's 'Nam land!
Yeow!
Well, what the hell was that?
I don't know, boy.
It looked like a big, big fireball.
Whoo!
'Nam land.
Napalm.
Fire in the hole.
Whoo!
That's the main butane tank up there, Bubba.
Go look at it.
Get your butt moving', boy.
Go up and look at it.
Go look at it.
- I'll kick your little ass again.
- Not now.
It's 'Nam land.
- It's a hit.
It's a bang.
It's a smash.
- Shut him up, Bubba!
Did you see it?
Well, did ya?
Didn't ya?
Did ya?
Didn't ya?
Go check it out, boy.
- 'Nam land!
- Oh, shut up.
I told you to go check it out, boy, before I start kickin' your ass.
Some kind of crazy booger just skipped through here.
HOW big?
A big crazy booger.
Let's haul butt, bro.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Franklin.
Don't you cry, my brother.
I'm here now.

Okay, what, are you pissed off?
What about me?
Listen, this is not gonna work out.
I'm trying to be open with you.
It's nobody's fault.
I just can't do this.
Let me go.
Let me go.
What the hell's going on here?
Bubba, you nap-haired idiot.
Get out of here.
Who's this?
I get it.
Are you the saboteur that's fuckin' up our house?
Trying to put me out of business?
Thousands of dollars lost.
- You got that kind of money?
- No!
It's the deejay.
My fave.
That dirty thing?
You told me you boys got her.
Well, yeah.
Leatherface killed her once already tonight.
But look.
She's red-faced.
Bubba's been playing with her.
Bubba likes her.
Bubba's got a girlfriend.
Bubba's got a girlfriend Bubba's got a girlfriend
Bubba's got a girlfriend
Bubba's got a girlfriend Bubba's got a girl...
Is that what this is, Bubba?
The ol' cock and cunt swindle, huh?
S-C-E-X.
Sex.
Hey, ya had to find out about it, didn't ya?
Ya just couldn't leave it alone.
If you wanted to know about it so bad, why didn't you ask me?
Oh, you wanna know about it?
You wanna know about it?
Ask me.
Ask me!
It's a swindle, that's all.
So don't get mixed up in it.
Help me.
Help me.
Help me.
- Please help me.
Please help me.
- "Help me."
Please help me.
All right, Miss Priss, cut that out.
Leave him alone, damn it!
Bubba, you were supposed to finish her.
Finish her now.
- Burn her like a rat.
- Finish her.
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her now.
Burn her like a rat!
Burn her like a rat-rat-rat!
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her now!
Finish her now, Bubba!
Finish her!
Finish her!
Give me that.
Turn traitor for a piece of tail.
You got one choice, boy...
sex or the saw.
Sex is, well, nobody knows.
But the saw, the saw is family.
- It's family.
- Wait till granddad hears about this.
Take her away.
- She's in the garbage now.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no!
- A-one...
And a-two...
And a-three!
Dinnertime, damn it!
Let's go.
Eat and run.
Eat and run.
There's a lot of hungry football fans to feed.
Hurry it up.
Grandpa likes to go fast.
He always did.
Come on.
Come on.
Time eats money.
Those damn coon shits.
Oh, the weight of the family.
I stoop my shoulders taking care of my younger brothers.
It squashed the young years out of my life...
Like a can of cheese whip.
I wouldn't wish this rotten life off... on a one-eyed ferret with mange.
You're the first girl Bubba's brought home to dinner.
She's a real special occasion.
Oh, Grandpa sure looks forward to meeting you.
He's 137 years old, but still as fast as Jesse James.
So don't you worry none.
Here comes Grandpa now.
God bless you, Grandpa.
Oh, it's playtime it's dinnertime
Your little boys have some left here for you
Yes, no, yes no, yes, we do
We love you We love you
Take it easy now.
Take it easy with Grandpa.
- That's right, easy.
- Get him over here easy.
That's right, boys.
Easy with Grandpa, now.
Oh, easy with Grandpa.
Oh, please, no.
Don't rattle him like that, damn it!
You're balling up his shit.
Grandpa's strict liquid diet keeps him as fresh as a rose.
Every spring the Atlas Rendering Company... used to throw a big barbecue for Grandpa.
Oh, he was the master.
He was the one and only.
He showed us all the business.
We was raised in meat.
But then after the glory, here comes the shame.
Atlas went for automation.
The electrified cages, the cold steel chutes, the air-powered head hammers.
It drove Grandpa crazy seeing things clone like that.
Let me go!
Let me go!
Oh, that's all right.
That's all right.
It be over soon.
Get the hammer.
Get the hammer.
The crunching and the grinding...
He just couldn't stand it, no way.
So, that was all she wrote.
One morning, Grandpa just quit going in.
It was the shame.
It was the shame.
The shame.
There's more work to do.
Let's get on with it.
Right.
Let's get on with it.
Bingo!
Give me that.
Get that tub over there in a hurry.
Do I have to do every damn thing around here?
You just sit...

Let me go!
You gotta let me go!
Please, help me!
- This will be one you won't forget.

It's a real honor.
Grandpa, he's a one-hitter.
And it's just like goin' home.
Please, help me!
No!
No, no, God!
Help me!
Let me go!

Sure... sure took care of my "hams."
Saved a trip to the hospital.

Time to shut down the show, yeah.
Yeah, pull the plug.

Lieutenant Enright, sir.
We heard you might be headed this way.
Did you come over for the big game?
You know why I'm here.
Yes, sir, something about the chainsaw killers, your brother's kids killed.
But that was 14 years ago, sir, way down in South Texas.
Now, these are other kids.
This is just an accident.
Just a couple of wild punks out raising hell.
Yep.
One of those boys is so wild, sawed his own head off going 90 mile per hour.
[chuckles] Hell.
Hell's exactly what they raised.
No, sir, that information's off the record.
You know, sir, this is always a pretty hairy weekend for Dallas.
Whole lot of folks come to town and don't give a damn about football.
You know, they just wanna go blood crazy for a few and riot.
You know what "riot" means.
You were a Ranger.
I can't hardly keep them down by law, and if...
If you go around promoting this chainsaw...
Try to speak plain.
Saves time.
I have authority from the DA's office to put you right back on the next plane to Amarillo.
Well, you just do that, son.
I'd like to see that authority.
All right, Lieutenant Enright, what's your deal?
All right.
I'm gonna ask some questions.

"You gotta run for that money now.
Chase that dollar.
Gotta go fast to catch it."
You dumb baboons are too dumb to even close the door.
I'm tired of kicking your asses.
What are you doing?
You trying to hide something?
[Leatherface moaning]
Get that eyeball pâté working.
Hey, you coon shit, where are you going?
We need the club sandwiches...
Help.
Help me.
Please.
Please, help me.
Can you help me get out of here?
What is it?
Put that down.
Put that down.
Put that down.
What is that?
Is it wet?
It's wet.
Put it down.
[sobbing]

[whimpering]

[L.G. groaning]
[groaning]
[yelps] [shrieking] [groaning loudly]
[whimpering]
[spits] [rasping] My darling.
[Stretch sobbing]
Darling?
Don't be scared, darling.
[groaning] [screams]
[Stretch] Oh no, L.G.
Oh no.
Oh no.
L.G.!
Oh, my God!
[sobbing] L.G., they got you, too?
Oh, L.G.!
[spits]
We gotta get y'all loose.
[groaning]
I guess I'm falling apart on you, honey.
[Stretch sobbing]
[L.G.] No.
[moaning] No.
[exhales]
Shit.
[shuddering]
[sobbing]
L.G.
I love you.
[loud rumbling]
[Drayton] So he says,
"Hey, get me those lawyers.
Legal meat."
- [man] Legal meat, yeah!
- [Drayton] Bubba, you idiot!
Get your ass over here.
- You fucked up again.
- [man] You fucked up again.
[Drayton] He says, "Hey, get me those lawyers.
Legal meat, y'all."
Fuck me in the left eye!
[laughs]
Valuable kill-time wasted running down them coked-up pencil necks, and not a good chop on the whole bunch.
I pick the vittles.
Get it?
- I. Me.
Nobody but...
- [man] I pick the vittles, I.
- [Drayton] Bubba, you hull wreckage!
- [man] Me.
Nobody but...
[Drayton] Busted again, huh?
That's the main support beam.
[cracking, rumbling]
Fuck, you idiots!
You both will pay!
Both of you...
You're both...
Look what your brother's done now.
You coon shit.
You cut the main support beam.
And this is what happens.
Of course this is what happens.
- [laughing]
- That big brute!
Dirty meat don't cut it.
Family standards only require the best meat in town.
More money lost.
I never, never, never get a break.
Work, work night and day, presenting myself to the people, selling, selling.
You pair of prima donnas fooling around here and listening to the radio all day and sawing down your own house.
Take it all down!
Bring it all down!
Bury the devil!
May the Lord have mercy on our souls!
Ah!
Get that thing out of here.
Maybe it cracked the main butane tank.
It's up there.
Go look at it.
Taxes.
Taxes.
Damn property taxes fuck up everything.
Crooks don't pay taxes.
Politicians don't.
Movie stars don't.
It's the little guy that can't make a dime.
He pays the taxes.
Small businessman gets it in the ass every time.
I ought to quit.
Right, it's junk.
Quit.
Dump this cook show.
Sell off this turkey.
It's time.
It's in the air.
It's what the public wants.
I don't wanna hear that again.
It's 'Nam Land!
- [fizzling] - [yelps]
Yow!
What the hell was that?
[high-pitched] I don't know, boy.
It looked like a big, big fireball.
[cackling]
'Nam Land.
Napalm.
Fire in the hole.
That's the main butane tank up there, Bubba.
Go look at it.
Get your butt moving, boy.
Go up there and look at it.
Go look at it.
- I'll kick you in the ass again.
- Not now.
It's 'Nam Land.
- It's a hit.
It's a bang.
It's a smash.
- Shut him up, Bubba.
Did you see it?
Well, did you?
Didn't you?
Did you?
Didn't you?
Go check it out, boy.
- 'Nam Land!
- Oh, shut up!
I told you to go check it out, boy, before I start kicking your ass.
Some kind of crazy booger just skipped through here.
No, a booger?
How big?
[high-pitched] A big crazy booger.
Let's haul butt, bro.
[whispers] Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Franklin.
Don't you cry, my brother.
I'm here now.
They can't do this.
They can't do this!
They can't do this!
They can't do this!
I'll take you back to hell!
I'll take you to hell!
[whimpering]
- [saw buzzing] - [screams]
[screams] [panting]
[screaming] [shouting]
All right, all right!
Let's talk about it.
OK.
What, are you pissed-off?
What about me?
Listen, this is not gonna work out.
[sobbing]
I'm trying to be open with you.
It's nobody's fault.
I just can't do this.
Let me go.
What the hell's going on here?
Bubba, you nap-haired idiot.
Get out of here.
Who's this?
I get it.
Are you the saboteur that's fucking up our house?
Trying to put me out of business?
Thousands of dollars lost.
You got that kind of money?
No!
It's the deejay.
My fave.
That dirty thing?
Told me you boys got her.
[man] Well, yeah.
Leatherface killed her once already tonight.
But look, she's red-faced.
Bubba's been playing with her.
Bubba likes her.
Bubba's got a girlfriend.
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girl... [screams, laughs]
Is that what this is, Bubba?
The old cock-and-cunt swindle, huh?
S-C-E-X.
Sex.
And you had to find out about it, didn't you?
You just couldn't leave it alone.
If you wanted to know about it so bad, why didn't you ask me?
You wanna know about it?
You wanna know about it?
Ask me.
Ask me.
It's a swindle, that's all.
So don't get mixed up in it.
[sobbing] Help me.
Help me.
Help me.
Please, help me.
Please.
[imitating] Help me.
[sobbing] Please, help me.
All right, Miss Priss, cut that out.
Leave him alone, damn it!
Bubba, you were supposed to finish her.
Finish her now.
- Burn her like a rat.
- Finish her.
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her now.
Burn her like a rat!
Burn her like a rat, rat, rat!
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her now!
- Finish her now, Bubba!
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her!
- Finish her.
Finish her.
Give me that.
Turn traitor for a piece of tail.
You got one choice, boy, sex or the saw.
Sex is, well, nobody knows.
But the saw, the saw is family.
- The saw is family.
- Wait till Granddad hears about this.
Take her away.
- She's in the garbage now.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
- A-one and a-two and a-three!
[screaming] No!
[Drayton] Dinnertime, damn it!
Let's go.
Eat and run.
Eat and run.
There's a lot of hungry football fans to feed.
Hurry it up.
Grandpa likes to go fast.
He always did.
Come on.
Come on.
Time eats money.
Those damn coon shits are the weight of the family.
I stoop my shoulders taking care of my younger brothers.
It squashed the young years out of my life like a can of cheese whip.
I wouldn't wish this rotten life off on a one-eyed ferret with mange.
You're the first girl Bubba's brought home to dinner.
This is a real special occasion.
Grandpa sure looks forward to meeting you.
He's 137 years old but still as fast as Jesse James, so don't you worry none.
- Here comes Grandpa now.
- [Stretch screams]
God bless you, Grandpa.
It's playtime!
It's dinnertime!
Your little boys have some left here for you.
Yes, no, yes, no!
Yes, we do!
[Drayton, man] We love you!
We love you!
OK, now.
Take it easy, now.
Take it easy with Grandpa.
- That's right.
That's right.
- Get him over here easy, now.
- That's right.
OK.
- Come on, you boys.
- [Stretch screaming]
- Easy with Grandpa, now.
- Easy with Grandpa.
- No!
No!
[Stretch] Oh, please, no.
Don't rattle him like that, damn it!
You're balling up his shit.
[screaming] No!
Grandpa's strict liquid diet keeps him as fresh as a rose.
Every spring, the Atlas Rendering Company used to throw a big barbecue for Grandpa.
He was the master.
He was the one and only.
He showed us all the business.
We was raised in meat. [laughs]
But then after the glory, here comes the shame.
Atlas went for automation.
The electrified cages, the cold-steel chutes, the air-powered head hammers.
That drove Grandpa crazy, seeing things done like that.
Let me go!
Let me go!
No, no, that's all right.
That's all right.
It'll be over soon.
Get the hammer.
The crunching and the grinding, he just couldn't stand it, no way.
So that was all she wrote.
One morning, Grandpa just quit going in.
It was the shame.
It was the shame.
The shame.
There's more work to do.
Let's get on with it.
Right.
Let's get on with it.
Bingo!
Give me that.
Get that tub over there in a hurry.
Do I have to do every damn thing around here?
- You just sit tight.
- [screaming]
Bubba, she's ready.
Bring her on down.
[screaming] No!
- Oh, no!
- Bring her on down, damn it!
[Stretch] No!
No!
Bring her on down!
No!
No, no, no!
No, no, no!
Help me!
No, no, no!
Let me go!
You gotta let me go!
Let me go!
Please, help me!
- This will be one you won't forget.
- Please, help me!
It's a real honor.
Grandpa, he's a one-hitter.
And it's just like going home.
Please help me!
- No!
No!
No, God!
- [man imitating] No, no.
Help me!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Help me, please!
Please, help me!
Let's go see Grandpa, boy.
No, don't!
- No!
No, God!
- Come on.
Bring the bitch down.
- [screaming] - [groaning]
No!
No!
No, no, let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
No!
No!
No, no, no!
No!
Here come the judge.
Here come the judge.
No!
Now, don't ruin Grandpa's favorite rug.
Be careful of the splatter.
You gotta be careful of the splatter.
- Great-grandma in chainsaw heaven...
- No!
No!
God!
...please don't hoodoo the boy.
Hey, Grandpa, here's the big boy.
Look what Bubba brought you.
Hey, Grandpa, Bubba's got something to show you here.
Look, a Slurpee booty. [laughs]
- Hit her, Grandpa.
- Come on, Grandpa.
Let's see you do it.
Now, come on.
Come on, Grandpa.
You're the best.
- Hit her, Grandpa.
Hit her!
- Come on.
Hit her, Grandpa.
Come on, I'm telling you...
Remember those thieves?
Come on.
One-hitter.
- Come on, Grandpa.
- Hit her.
Hit her, Grandpa.
Come on, you won't miss her.
- [Grandpa groaning] - [screaming]
Come on, Grandpa.
Hit her.
Hit that bitch.
Hit that bitch.
Come on, Grandpa.
Come on, Grandpa.
You can do it.
You're the best.
Come on, there, Grandpa.
Come on, there, Grandpa.
Come on, Grandpa.
You can do it.
You're the best.
- Hit that bitch, Grandpa.
Hit her.
- [screaming]
Come on, Grandpa.
Hit her.
You are, Grandpa.
You're the best.
- [moaning]
- Yeah!
That's good, isn't it, Grandpa?
[screaming]
Grandpa!
- Attaboy, Grandpa.
- Hit that bitch, now, Grandpa.
- Come on, Grandpa.
You can do it.
- Get her now, Grandpa.
You can do it.
Come on, Grandpa.
[Stretch] No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Hit that bitch.
Hit that bitch!

Oh, Grandpa, let's get on with it.

All right, keep the tension on that line.
Hey, loosen that chain.

You, get out of there!
Cowboy, get away from there.
This is an accident scene.
The area is restricted.
Not gonna tell you agai...
It's all... it's all right, Wendell.
Lieutenant Enright, sir.
We heard you might be headed this way.
Uh, did you come over for the big game?
You know why I'm here.
Yes, sir, something about the chainsaw killers.
Your brother's kids killed...
But that was 14 years ago, sir, way down in South Texas.
Now, these are other kids.
This is just an accident.
Just a couple of wild punks, out raising hell.
Yup.
One of those boys so wild, sawed his own head off going 90 mile per hour.
Hell.
Hell's exactly what they raised.
Uh, no, sir.
That information's off the record.
You know, sir, this is always a pretty hairy weekend for Dallas.
Whole lot of folks come to town, don't give a damn about football.
You know, they just want to go blood crazy for a few... riot.
You know what riot means, you were a ranger.
Can't hardly keep 'em down by law, and if...
If you go around promoting' this chainsaw...
Try to speak plain.
Saves time.
I have authority from the D.A.'s office to put you right back on the next plane to Amarillo.
Well, you just do that, son.
I'd like to see that authority.
All right, Lieutenant Enright, what's your deal?
All right.
I'm gonna ask some questions.
Put it in the press.
Get it in the news.
Any information about this accident, and maybe, uh, some witnesses.
Yes, sir, I, uh...
I know some old boys at the paper.
We'll get your story out for ya.
Brazos.
Bra-zos.
Bra-zos!
Remember the Alamo, cowboy.
Look, Ma, a whore!
Wanna fuck!
Asshole.
You need a witness?
I'm a witness.
Uh, this Mercedes?
I think I was talkin' to those kids when it happened.
- No way was that an accident.
- You saw it.
No, but I heard it.
You can listen.
It's here on tape.
- Oh, shit.
- Come on!
Whoo!
Regulations.
We gotta record all the call-ins.
End of the night we wipe the tapes, but I kept this one...
Just 'cause... it just got to me.
We got professionals...
I didn't know exactly what I'd heard, but I read your story, and I think what you're lookin' for is on this tape.
You can just not fool with it.
You can slow it down now.
Um, you're just a joke in this morning's paper.
"Cowboy Chases Chainsaws 14 Years."
"Dallas Police Refuse Comment."
Like you're... you know, hung up on somethin' crazy.
But I believe you.
I might be the only believer you got.
'Cause it's right here.
What is?
Right on here, those kids gettin' killed.
Now, this is evidence, sort of, right?
Yeah, it's time for you to go home.
No, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Look.
I came here because I could help you.
I deejay this dumb show on K-OKLA up in Burkburnett...
But people listen to me all across North Texas...
Now, I could put you on the radio.
Get people to believe you.
Get you some help.
You're gonna get in my way.
Don't you get in my way.
No, I'm already right in the middle of this.
This is my chance to stop playin' head-bangin' music and do something real.
Well, I don't need anybody to stand with me.
- All right?
- You can't do it alone.
I got a perfect willingness to die.
That gives me a moral on this bunch of mad dogs.
They live on fear.
They thrive on it.
I ain't got no fear left.
Adios.

Don't skimp on the meat.
I-I got a real good eye for prime meat.
Runs in the family.
Whoop, whoop.
One of those hard-shell peppercorns.
I gotta say, I love this town.
This town loves prime meat!
So, there's the big story.
Texas clobbers Oklahoma in chili.
This is Stretch, your fearless reporter, live from Dallas.
Now, be sure to watch your drinkin' and drivin'... on this wild and woolly Texas/O. U. weekend.
This is Stretch, on K-OKLA Ra...
Cut-Rite.
Naw, 'Ceil, I ain't seen Fletcher.
Well, last Friday.
Well, hell, he's on the road, then.
Well, don't believe me, then.
Fine.
'Ceil.
No.
I'll be with you in just a minute, sir.
Now, you're as good and mean as a sting bat, 'Ceil.
No, hell, don't call back.
No, don't you call back.
I got a business here, and Fletcher ain't none of my business.
Damn!
What can I do you for?
But don't you want to test 'em?
There's gas in them.
Give them suckers a time or two.
Oh, my achin' banana.
Damn, what is he doing?
Now, this... is very hard to believe.
I'd like you to play that tape, Missy.
Come all the way up here to Burkburnett, no shit!
Yeah.
- Oh, you wanna hear it now.
- I wanna hear it on the radio.
- On your show.
- Uh-uh.
I don't think it'd be legal to do that.
F.C.C. regulations...
those things.
Well, you just figure out how to do it, and do it.
You bend the rules, I don't know.
- Why?
- Because the killers are here.
Kill sites have been clustered all over Northeast Texas the last two years.
The laws, they shy away from piecing' it together as murder.
They call it accidents, disappearances.
You got that last slaughter on tape.
You play it on the radio.
Maybe then the laws will stop trying to shut me up and start helping me.
Besides, it'll give you something real to do.
You said you were gonna do this alone.
I need your help, Missy.
Well, you can call me Stretch, Mr. Enright.
Well, now, you can call me Lefty.
It's mighty nice doin' business with you.
- Thanks.
- All right.
You have a nice day, now.
You, too.
Number one again!
Drayton did it again.
Number one.
♪ Number one, the Sawyers are number one ♪
Number one.
♪ K-O-K-L-A ♪
So here's a special request we're doing this afternoon and tonight.
You steady listeners know we're playing this every hour.
This is for Lefty.
Hog fucker!
Son of a bitch!
Last Round-up Rolling Grill.
We're still number one.
I told you, boys, and I told you.
Don't call on this phone.
Now damn it, get off.
What?
What's on the radio?
Ah, now, don't bullshit me.
I can't...
I won't...
All right, what station?
This ain't no joke, boy?
Then, I'm tuning' it in.
You-you nap-haired idiot.
You-you've done it again!
Ah, you coon shits.
You-you fudge packers,
You'll be the death of me yet!
Missed us, assholes.
Buzz!
- K-OKLA.
- Oh, God!
Come on, Lefty.
Where are you?
This concludes the broadcast day for K-OKLA, in Burkburnett, Texas,
Red River Rock 'n' Roll.
In New York, it's 1:00 a.m., still, fun city.
In L.A., 10:00 at night, party time.
But deep in the heart of Texas, It's 12:00 midnight.
Ain't nothin' goin' on.
That's another cussing caller.
Your little ass gonna be in big trouble over that tape, girl.
Nope.
Sure got a lot of complaints, darlin'.
L.G., it was a request, right?
It's listed in the logs as a request.
People complain about the request every night, right?
Uh-huh.
Want to go for coffee at the Big Steak?
Nope.
Huh, I guess you're waitin' on this guy Lefty?
L.G...
Good night, L.G.
Good night.
Goddamn it!
Shit!
K-OKLA, this is Stretch.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello, Lefty?
L.G.?
Lefty?

Lefty?
I-I wanna...
I want to buy some, uh, radio ad time.
Are you fuckin' crazy?
We are closed!
Off the air till tomorrow.
You'll have to just... come back...
No, but...
but yeah, but...
Whoa!
So, this is radioland, huh?
The infinite turtle?
The waves through the ether fuzz roll on forever?
R-roar-r-r!
Can't close that.
Hi, I know what you're thinking.
"This is weird.
Hopin' I can handle it."
You know?
You're my fave.
Me and 'Bubba', my little brother, we listen to you every night.
Music is my life.
You know, you're my fave.
But I get too embarrassed to phone in my request.
It's too disembodied, you know?
But, uh... ahh!
Now that we're here in flesh and blood,
I could maybe make a request, and it'd still count, huh?
Uh-huh, sure.
Mm-hmm.
Well, what about, uh...
Iron Butterfly?
You know, like uh, "In-A-Vida-Da-Gadda, Baby"?
Oh, it's heavy!
You know, I've never been... to a r-r-radio station before.
Do you think you could do me a tour, huh?
Tour?
All right.
Tour?
Sure.
Mm-hmm, sure.
But seriously quick.
And it ends at the exit sign.
Oh, boy!
Okay.
Yeah, sure!
Okay, your tour.
Here's your tour.
Here's your tour.
- Here's a lamp.
- Yeah, a lamp.

Rubber man.
I like him.
Armadillo.
Here's Mr. Shark.
Oh, Mr. Shark!
Here's some flowers.
- Rolodex.
- Oh, very nice.
- Here's a lamp.
- Oh!
And there's the exit sign.
Tour's over.
Ahh.
"E-X...
I-T!"
Exit!
- Good night.
- Oh!
Good night!
Good night!
Good night.
Good night.
Good night!
Hey, what about my request?
You know.
That Lefty request record?
Th-that you honked out today?
I loved that!
Let's see, uh...
Wh-what was it, anyway?
The Rambo III soundtrack?
Gonna play it again?
Sure would like it.
Hey!
Maybe I could get a copy!
And-and you could autograph it!
To, uh, uh, "A far-out fan"!
- What's in here?
- Record vault.
Oh, where you keep the "golden oldies"?
And, uh...
And maybe, uh...
Maybe the new music's in Th...
Ow, not me, you dumb-ass!

Ohh.
Leatherface, you bitch, I'll...
Look what you did to my Sonny Bono wig 'do!
Oh, goddamn, I can't believe it.
You got to buy me a new plate cover!
You got to buy me a new plate cover, Leatherface.
Ohh!
Oh.
Oh, he's going to send me back to the V.A. hospital, with this dent in my plate.
Well, at least he didn't mess me up.
Dog will hunt.
Get that bitch, Leatherface!
Get that bitch!
Dog will hunt.
Go away!
No-o-o-o!
Shit.
Humble Pie!
Hurry up, Leatherface!
Hurry up!
Get that bitch!
Go away!
Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain!
Music is my life!
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
Stretch, darlin', you know the door's unlocked?
Hey!
- What the shit?
- Hey!
L-lick my plate, you dog click!
What the fuck you think you're doin' in here, you crazy-lookin' little son of a bitch?
Get out of here!
Shit!
Time for incoming mail!
Ho Chi Minh!
A-one, and a-two, and a-three!
Go, you little bitch!
Go away!
Leave me alone!
No, no, no, no, no, please, don't!
Incoming mail!
No, no, no, please, don't!
No!
No, no, please, God!
Stop it!
No, no, please, God!
Stop it!
God, no!
No, no, please, God!
Are you mad at me?
How mad at me are you?
You're not really mad at me.
How good are you?
Huh?
Get that bitch, Leatherface!
Get that bitch!
How... good... are... you?
Oh.
Really?
Oh.
Are you really, really... good?
You're really, really good.
You're really good.
You're the best.
Oh, no!
No, no!
No, God!
No, please, God!
No, God!
Oh, God, oh, God!
Leatherface.
Did you get her, 'Bubba'?
Did you get that bitch?
She... she was my fave.
But she knew.
And now nobody knows.
Oh!
Look what you did to my plate, you bitch!
You got her?
Did you get her good?
Hey.
Slap me five.
I got one, too.
A bonus body!
Look at that beef.
Help me get it out of here.
Whoa!
Ooh!
Giddyap!
No.
They'll get away.
No, no.
They'll get away.
They can't get away.
Goddamn it, Lefty.
You're late.
Damn it, Lefty.
Oh!
Ugh!
Ugh!
Stretch!
Lefty?
Stretch!
Hold on!
Grab onto something!
Hold onto it!
Lefty, they came!
Where were you?
I had to do it.
Damn, I used you, girl.
I'm here now.
Grab hold of this.
Grab hold of this.
Now, don't you cry, little sister.
I'm here now.
Come on.
I'm here now.
You can get it.
Come on, now.
You got it.
Come on.
- Aah!
- Come on!
Grab it!
Oh, my God.
O Lord...
Help me beat this stranger that walks beside me... and takes away my strength.
Lord, you show me the end.
Show me what I fear, so I don't fear it no more.
It's the devil's playground.
I'm bringin' it down!
Down to Hell!
Bring it all down!
Bring it all down!
Hate to say it, but that hillbilly hog you boys got earlier is the top catch tonight!
That's mine, my hit!
Not Bubba's.
Me!
Me!
Oh, bust it up!
Wanna go to the movies?
No crowds.
Everybody's at the football parties.
Huh?
Tonight's a washout.
Biggest meat-eater weekend of the month, and we're gonna lose money on it.
Damn it all.
Maybe just ought to quit.
Oh, yeah?
Kiss my plate, Mr. Big Shot.
Maybe you forgot.
This chromedome bankrolled this little business.
No lucky gook with a machete, no head wound.
No head wound, no fancy rolling grill and go-go.
Ain't no fool.
Kiss it.
Don't forget it.
Peel that pig and slice him thick.
- That's my sweet pea.
- Get them hogs on the grill.
Big pre-game brunch tomorrow means a ton of croissant sandwiches.
Oh, I love this town.
Hey, you nitwit.
Get back in here and get this grill goin'.
'"Oh!
Oh!
No.
No.
No good.
No good.
No good.
Come on, Bubba.
The Cook's out here, and he's chewin' ass like it was steak!
You gotta run for that money now.
Chase that dollar.
Go fast to catch it.
You dumb baboozer.
Too dumb to even close...
I'm tired of kicking your asses.
What are you doing?
You trying to hide something?
Well, get that eyeball pate workin'.
Hey, you coon shit, where you goin'?
We need the club sandwiches...
Help.
Help me.
Please.
Please help me.
Can you help me get out of here?
What is...
Put that down.
Put that down.
Put that down!
What is that?
Is it wet?
It's wet.
Put it down.
My darlin'.
Darlin'.
Darlin'.
Don't be scared, darlin'.
Oh, no, L.G.
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
L.G.!
Oh, my God!
L-G-I they got you, too?
Oh, L.G.!
We got to get you all loose.
I guess I'm fallin' apart on you, honey.
No!
Navy!
Shit.
L.G.
I love you.
Hey, get me those lawyers.
Legal meat, yum!
Legal meat, yeah!
Bubba, you idiot!
Get your ass over here.
- You fucked up again.
- You fucked up again.
He says, "Hey, you get me those lawyers.
Legal meat, y'all."
Our valuable kill time wasted runnin' down them coked-up pencil necks.
And not a good chop on the whole bunch.
I pick the vittles.
Get it?
I. Me.
Nobody but me.
Bubba, you home wrecking'...
Busted again, huh?
That's the main support beam...
Fuck, you idiots!
You're fucked...
Look what your brother's clone now.
You coon shit.
You cut the main support beam.
And this is what happens.
Of course this is what happens.
That pig's ruined!
Dirty meat don't cut it.
Family standards only require the best meat in town.
More money lost.
I never, never, never get a break.
Work.
Work night and day...
Presenting myself to the people, selling, selling.
You pair of prima Donnas fool around here and listen to the radio all day...
And... sawing down your own house.
Shake it all out!
Bring it all down!
Bury the devil!
May the Lord have mercy on our souls.
Get that thing out of here.
Maybe it cracked the main butane tank.
It's up there.
Go look at it.
Taxes, taxes.
Damn property taxes fuck up everything.
Crooks don't pay taxes.
Politicians don't.
Movie stars don't.
It's the little guy that can't make a dime.
He pays the taxes.
Small businessman gets it in the ass every time.
I ought to quit.
Right, it's, "junk, quit, dump this, cook show."
Sell off this turkey.
It's time.
It's in the air.
It's what the public wants.
I don't wanna hear that again.
It's 'Nam land!
Yeow!
Well, what the hell was that?
I don't know, boy.
It looked like a big, big fireball.
Whoo!
'Nam land.
Napalm.
Fire in the hole.
Whoo!
That's the main butane tank up there, Bubba.
Go look at it.
Get your butt moving', boy.
Go up and look at it.
Go look at it.
- I'll kick your little ass again.
- Not now.
It's 'Nam land.
- It's a hit.
It's a bang.
It's a smash.
- Shut him up, Bubba!
Did you see it?
Well, did ya?
Didn't ya?
Did ya?
Didn't ya?
Go check it out, boy.
- 'Nam land!
- Oh, shut up.
I told you to go check it out, boy, before I start kickin' your ass.
Some kind of crazy booger just skipped through here.
HOW big?
A big crazy booger.
Let's haul butt, bro.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Franklin.
Don't you cry, my brother.
I'm here now.
I'm here now.
They can't do this.
They can't do this!
They can't do this!
They can't do this!
I'll take you back to Hell!
I'll take you to hell!
All right, all right!
Let's talk about it.
Okay, what, are you pissed off?
What about me?
Listen, this is not gonna work out.
I'm trying to be open with you.
It's nobody's fault.
I just can't do this.
Let me go.
Let me go.
What the hell's going on here?
Bubba, you nap-haired idiot.
Get out of here.
Who's this?
I get it.
Are you the saboteur that's fuckin' up our house?
Trying to put me out of business?
Thousands of dollars lost.
- You got that kind of money?
- No!
It's the deejay.
My fave.
That dirty thing?
You told me you boys got her.
Well, yeah.
Leatherface killed her once already tonight.
But look.
She's red-faced.
Bubba's been playing with her.
Bubba likes her.
Bubba's got a girlfriend.
Bubba's got a girlfriend Bubba's got a girlfriend
Bubba's got a girlfriend
Bubba's got a girlfriend Bubba's got a girl...
Is that what this is, Bubba?
The ol' cock and cunt swindle, huh?
S-C-E-X.
Sex.
Hey, ya had to find out about it, didn't ya?
Ya just couldn't leave it alone.
If you wanted to know about it so bad, why didn't you ask me?
Oh, you wanna know about it?
You wanna know about it?
Ask me.
Ask me!
It's a swindle, that's all.
So don't get mixed up in it.
Help me.
Help me.
Help me.
- Please help me.
Please help me.
- "Help me."
Please help me.
All right, Miss Priss, cut that out.
Leave him alone, damn it!
Bubba, you were supposed to finish her.
Finish her now.
- Burn her like a rat.
- Finish her.
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her now.
Burn her like a rat!
Burn her like a rat-rat-rat!
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her now!
Finish her now, Bubba!
Finish her!
Finish her!
Give me that.
Turn traitor for a piece of tail.
You got one choice, boy...
sex or the saw.
Sex is, well, nobody knows.
But the saw, the saw is family.
- It's family.
- Wait till granddad hears about this.
Take her away.
- She's in the garbage now.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no!
- A-one...
And a-two...
And a-three!
Dinnertime, damn it!
Let's go.
Eat and run.
Eat and run.
There's a lot of hungry football fans to feed.
Hurry it up.
Grandpa likes to go fast.
He always did.
Come on.
Come on.
Time eats money.
Those damn coon shits.
Oh, the weight of the family.
I stoop my shoulders taking care of my younger brothers.
It squashed the young years out of my life...
Like a can of cheese whip.
I wouldn't wish this rotten life off... on a one-eyed ferret with mange.
You're the first girl Bubba's brought home to dinner.
She's a real special occasion.
Oh, Grandpa sure looks forward to meeting you.
He's 137 years old, but still as fast as Jesse James.
So don't you worry none.
Here comes Grandpa now.
God bless you, Grandpa.
Oh, it's playtime it's dinnertime
Your little boys have some left here for you
Yes, no, yes no, yes, we do
We love you We love you
Take it easy now.
Take it easy with Grandpa.
- That's right, easy.
- Get him over here easy.
That's right, boys.
Easy with Grandpa, now.
Oh, easy with Grandpa.
Oh, please, no.
Don't rattle him like that, damn it!
You're balling up his shit.
Grandpa's strict liquid diet keeps him as fresh as a rose.
Every spring the Atlas Rendering Company... used to throw a big barbecue for Grandpa.
Oh, he was the master.
He was the one and only.
He showed us all the business.
We was raised in meat.
But then after the glory, here comes the shame.
Atlas went for automation.
The electrified cages, the cold steel chutes, the air-powered head hammers.
It drove Grandpa crazy seeing things clone like that.
Let me go!
Let me go!
Oh, that's all right.
That's all right.
It be over soon.
Get the hammer.
Get the hammer.
The crunching and the grinding...
He just couldn't stand it, no way.
So, that was all she wrote.
One morning, Grandpa just quit going in.
It was the shame.
It was the shame.
The shame.
There's more work to do.
Let's get on with it.
Right.
Let's get on with it.
Bingo!
Give me that.
Get that tub over there in a hurry.
Do I have to do every damn thing around here?
You just sit...
Bubba, she's ready.
Bring her on down.
- Oh, no!
- Bring her on down, damn it!
No!
No!
Bring her on down!
Ah!
No!
No, no, no!
- No!
No!
No!
- Shh.
Help me.
No, no, no!
Let me go!
You gotta let me go!
Please, help me!
- This will be one you won't forget.
- Please, help me!
It's a real honor.
Grandpa, he's a one-hitter.
And it's just like goin' home.
Please, help me!
No!
No, no, God!
Help me!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Help me, please!
Please, help me!
Let's go see Grandpa, boy!

No, no!
No, no!
Let me go!
Let go
Let me go!
No!
No!
No, no, no!
Here come the judge.
Here come the judge.
No!
All right, now, don't ruin Grandma's favorite rug.
Be careful of the splatter.
You gotta be careful of the splatter.
Oh, great Grandma...
- in chainsaw heaven.
- No!
Oh, God!
Please, don't hoodoo the boy.
Hey, Grandpa, here's the big boy.
Look what Bubba brought ya.
Hey, Grandpa, Bubba's got somethin' to show ya here.
Look, a slurpy booty.
Hit her, Grandpa.
Let's see you do it now.

Yeah, that's right.
It's a dog-eat-dog world.
And from where I sit, there just ain't enough damn clogs.
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the damn kitchen.
Hey, how much, huh?
Let's make a deal right here.
Real cash money.
Just you and me, huh?
I don't care who sent ya.
I'm the lord of the harvest.
Who's that?
Some new health food bunch?
Come on.
Come on.
Is there any money in it, you wanna know?
Yeah, right here.
How much?
Huh?
How much?
- Lefty.

Lefty!
Brazos!
Run, sister, run!
Small businessman... always, always, always gets it in the ass!
Sure... sure took care of my "hams."
Saved a trip to the hospital.
Ah, looks...
looks bad.
Sure burned my beans bad on that one.
Maybe it's time to just shut down.
Time to shut down the show, yeah.
Yeah, pull the plug.
Come here, Nubbins.
Where... where's that old "fuck you, Charlie," huh?
That... that little "just in case," baby.
Where'd you put it?
Ah!
Yeah, there it is.
Man... man builds a good, sturdy trade... by hooking' and crookin'.
And then... kerplooey!
The Gods just kick him right in the balls.
Oh, no.

This is Stretch.
[woman] That's for Glen.
And could you tell the girls at Mesquite High just to leave him alone?
[Stretch] Got it, and I believe it.
Glen is off-limits now.
This is Stretch on an open request line on K-OKLA in Burkburnett, Texas,
Red River Rock 'n' Roll, from the tip-top of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.
[♪ The Cramps: "Goo Goo Muck"]
Heck, let's give Stretch a call and see what she says.

Yo, Stretch!
It's the one and only Buzz.
And Rick the Prick!
[laughs]
And from all the senior boys at Wheeler High to all the senior girls, who are so stuck-up, play "You're on the Road to Nowhere."
No, you mean, "We're on the Road to Nowhere."
No, baby.
We're on the road to Texas-OU Weekend in Dallas!
You're on the road to nowhere!
[laughs]
Hook them horns, baby!
Whoo!
[chuckles] Real funny, guys.
OK, you wanna hang up now?
Tying up the line.
Hey, come on.
- No way, baby!
- We got a lot more requests!
Hey, check it out, dude.
Let's play a little chicken with the farmer here.
- [laughs]
- Whoo!
- Come on, baby!
Come on!
- Whoo-hoo!
Come on!
[laughing, whooping]
Come on, man.
[horn honks] [laughing over phone] [laughing]
- Come on!
- Whoo!
[whooping, laughing] [horn honks] [whooping]
- Hot damn!
- Hook them horns!
Whoo!
That was great!
That was great!
You got that, babe?
Hot line?
[Buzz] You better stick with us, baby!
Yeah.
Later, sports.
Just hang up, OK?
- [Buzz] No way!
- [cackling]
Hook them horns!
Whoo!
- L.G.!
- Damn it, I'm trying, darling.
Don't call me darling, damn it.
[laughing] [both laughing hysterically]
[♪ The Cramps: "Goo Goo Muck"]
Yow!
It's 8:11, Texas-time, on a Friday night.
I know nobody's listening because y'all are all zooming, but I got a shot of hot rock 'n' roll for you anyway.
[phone rings]
[♪ Oingo Boingo:
"No One Lives Forever"]
K-OKLA, Red River Rock 'n' Roll Request.
What it is, Stretch?
This is the Buzz again.
Oh, not again.
Hang it up, lame-o.
Go call your mother.
Yeah, yeah, talk dirty.
But this is for Rick the Prick.
He wants to hear "Bright Lights, Big Titties."
Wrong.
I don't want to hear it.
I want to see it!
Bright lights, big titties!
Whoo!
L.G.?
L.G., get in here, please.
[whooping, laughing on phone]
Whoo!
[laughs]
[truck horn honks]
What the fuck?
Are you crazy?
Back up, pig fucker!
Come on.
Hurry up.
Get out of here!
- Oh, my God!
- They gotta hang up.
Step on it!
- Shit!
What the fuck?
- Come on, hurry up!
[Stretch] Hang up!
[screeching]
- What the hell is that?
- Look, it's some kind of geek.
- The geek's got a...
- Come on.
What is that?
- Shit!
- Come on.
Get out of here.
- Where'd he come from?
- I don't believe this shit!
[Rick] Just keep driving.
Come on.
- [Rick] Hey, let's go.
Come on.
- [Buzz] What the hell is that?
- Go on!
What's he doing?
- God damn it!
[Rick] What's he got there?
[Buzz] Jesus Christ!
- What?
- Come on.
What is that?
- I don't believe this shit!
- Come on!
[Rick] You can do it!
Come on!
[Buzz] Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
- Holy shit!
- Come on, get out of here!
[Rick] He's got a fucking chainsaw!
[chainsaw buzzing, screaming over phone] [whimpering] [screaming]
- Sounds like a buzz saw.
- Buzz saw?
Hey, hang up, man.
Hang up.
Hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up!
Get him.
Shoot the bastard.
Get him.
Shit!
Fuck!
Shoot that motherfucker, yeah!
- [screams] - [saw buzzing] [yelling]
Shit!
Keep back!
God!
[yelling]
Son of a bitch!
Shit!
[yelling on phone] [gunshot]
Missed us, assholes.
[screaming]
[crashing on phone]
What?
It just cut off.
Did you do that?
What happened?
It's like super feedback.
Just put the underwoofer across the overflapper.
I don't know.
Just went dead air.
- I want the license plate.
- No problem.
All right, now, ease up here.
[man] You go get your pictures.
[man 2] Watch out, Bob.
All right, keep the tension on that line.
[man 3] Hey, loosen that chain.
We need some slack.
- [siren wails]
- Easy.
Easy.
You, get out of there!
[over radio] Three-zero.
Cowboy, get away from there.
This is an accident scene.
The area is restricted.
- Not gonna tell you...
- It's all right, Wendell.
Lieutenant Enright, sir.
We heard you might be headed this way.
Did you come over for the big game?
You know why I'm here.
Yes, sir, something about the chainsaw killers, your brother's kids killed.
But that was 14 years ago, sir, way down in South Texas.
Now, these are other kids.
This is just an accident.
Just a couple of wild punks out raising hell.
Yep.
One of those boys is so wild, sawed his own head off going 90 mile per hour.
[chuckles] Hell.
Hell's exactly what they raised.
No, sir, that information's off the record.
You know, sir, this is always a pretty hairy weekend for Dallas.
Whole lot of folks come to town and don't give a damn about football.
You know, they just wanna go blood crazy for a few and riot.
You know what "riot" means.
You were a Ranger.
I can't hardly keep them down by law, and if...
If you go around promoting this chainsaw...
Try to speak plain.
Saves time.
I have authority from the DA's office to put you right back on the next plane to Amarillo.
Well, you just do that, son.
I'd like to see that authority.
All right, Lieutenant Enright, what's your deal?
All right.
I'm gonna ask some questions.
Put it in the press.
Get it in the news.
Any information about this accident... and maybe some witnesses.
Yes, sir, I...
I know some old boys at the paper.
We'll get your story out for you.
Brazos.
Brazos!
Remember the Alamo, cowboy.
- [whooping, laughing] - [pounding on door] [man] I won!
Wanna fuck?
Asshole.
You need a witness?
I'm a witness.
This Mercedes?
I think I was talking to those kids when it happened.
No way was that an accident.
- You saw it.
- No, but I heard it.
You can listen.
It's here on tape.
Oh, shit.
Come on.
Regulations.
We gotta record all the call-ins.
End of the night, we wipe the tapes, but I kept this one just 'cause...
It just got to me.
- We got professionals working...
- I didn't know what I heard, but I read your story.
What you're looking for
- is on this tape.
- ...so don't fool with it.
You can slow it down now.
You're just a joke in this morning's paper.
"Cowboy chases chainsaws 14 years.
Dallas police refuse comment."
Like you're, you know, hung up on something crazy.
But I believe you.
I might be the only believer you got.
- 'Cause it's right here.
- What is?
Right on here, those kids getting killed.
Now, this is evidence, sort of, right?
Yeah, it's time for you to go home.
- No, wait a minute.
- Come on.
Look, I came here because I thought I could help you.
I deejay this dumb show on K-OKLA up in Burkburnett, but people listen to me all across North Texas.
Now, I could put you on the radio, get people to believe you, get you some help.
You're gonna get in my way.
- Don't you get in my way.
- No, I'm already right in the middle of this.
This is my chance to stop playing head-banging music and do something real.
Well, I don't need anybody to stand with me, all right?
You can't do it alone.
I got a perfect willingness to die.
That gives me a moral on this bunch of mad dogs.
They live on fear.
They thrive on it.
I ain't got no fear left.
Adios.
I ain't got no fear, Lord.
[rock music plays]
[muttering]
- Hardass.
- Hardass?
Me?
Well, maybe a semi-hardass, but I got a soft heart.
Looky.
- Built you a little fry house.
- L.G.!
What, darling?
Oh, L.G.
[bell ringing]
OK, everybody, hush up.
Listen up, y'all.
The Texas-OU Chili Cook-off champion is
- from Norman, Oklahoma?
No.
- [all] No!
Waco, Texas?
Mm-mm.
Tulsa?
Nope.
- Pardon me.
- Austin?
Uh-uh.
He's Dallas' favorite caterer, and I think he's kind of cute.
The Last Round-up Rolling Grill chef,
- Drayton Sawyer!
- [cheering] [crowd chanting] Drayton!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Drayton!
It's the second year in a row.
This year, Drayton, you've got to tell the secret of that fabulously tasty chili!
No secret.
It's the meat.
Don't skimp on the meat.
I got a real good eye for prime meat.
Runs in the family.
Whoop!
Whoop!
[chuckles]
It's one of those, uh, hard-shell peppercorns.
I gotta say, I love this town.
This town loves prime meat!
[cheering]
So there's the big story.
Texas clobbers Oklahoma in chili.
This is Stretch, your fearless reporter, live from Dallas.
[marching band music plays]
[man speaking indistinctly on radio]
[Stretch on radio] Now, be sure to watch your drinking and driving on this wild and woolly Texas-OU Weekend.
- This is Stretch, on K-OKLA...
- [shuts off radio]
Cut-Rite.
No, C.L., I ain't seen Fletcher.
Well, last Friday.
Well, hell, he's on the road, then.
Well, don't believe me, then.
Fine.
C.L...
No.
I'll be with you in just a minute, sir.
Now, you're getting as mean as a sting bat, C.L.
No, hell, don't call back.
No, don't you call back.
I got a business here, and Fletcher ain't none of my business.
Damn!
What can I do you for?
Well, don't you wanna test them?
There's gas in them.
Get them suckers a time or two.
Oh, my kid banana.
Damn, what is he doing?
[man laughing]
Now, this is very hard to believe.
I'd like you to play that tape, missy.
Come all the way up here to Burkburnett.
No shit!
Yeah.
Oh, you wanna hear it now.
I wanna hear it on the radio.
On your show.
Uh-uh.
I don't think it'd be legal to do that.
FCC regulations, those things.
Well, you just figure out how to do it and do it.
You bend the rules.
I don't know.
Huh!
- Why?
- Because the killers are here.
Kill sites have been clustered all over Northeast Texas the last two years.
The laws, they shy away from piecing it together as murder.
They call it accidents, disappearances.
You got that last slaughter on tape.
You play it on the radio.
Maybe then, the laws will stop trying to shut me up and start helping me.
Besides, it'll give you something real to do.
- You said you were gonna do this alone.
- [sighs]
I need your help, missy.
Well... you can call me Stretch, Mr. Enright.
Well, now, you can call me Lefty.
It's mighty nice doing business with you.
- Thanks.
- All right.
You have a nice day, now.
You, too.

This concludes the broadcast day for K-OKLA in Burkburnett, Texas,
Red River Rock 'n' Roll.
In New York, it's 1:00am, still fun city.
In LA, 10:00 at night, party time.
But deep in the heart of Texas, it's 12:00 midnight.
Ain't nothing going on.

- It's another cussing caller.
Your little ass is gonna be in big trouble over that tape, girl.
Nope.
[spits]
[sighs] Sure got a lot of complaints, darling.
L.G., it was a request, right?
It's listed in the logs as a request.
People complain about the request every night, right?
Uh-huh.
Wanna go for coffee at Big State?
Nope.
Huh, I guess you're waiting on this guy, Lefty?
L.G.
Night, L.G.
Good night.

I wanna buy some radio-ad time.
Are you fucking crazy?
We are closed!
Off the air till tomorrow.
You'll have to just come back.
[man] No, but...
But, yeah, but...
Whoa!
So this is radio land, huh?
The infinite turnover?
The waves through the ether fuzz roll on forever.
Roar!
Can't close that.
Hi, I know what you're thinking.
"This is weird.
Hope I can handle it." [laughs]
You know... you're my fave.
Me and Bubba, my little brother, we listen to you every night.
Music is my life.
You know, you're my fave, but I get too embarrassed to phone in my request.
It's too disembodied, you know?
But... [groans]
Now that we're here in flesh and blood,
I could maybe make a request, and it'd still count, huh?
Sure.
Mm-hm.
Well, what about...
Iron Butterfly?
[laughs]
You know, like "In-A-Vida-Da-Gadda, Baby?"
It's heavy!
You know,
I've never been to a radio station before.
Do you think you could do me a tour, huh?
Tour?
Tour.
Sure, sure.
But seriously quick, and it ends at the exit sign.
Oh, boy!
OK, yeah, sure!
OK, your tour.
Here's your tour.
Here's your tour.
Here's a lamp.
Yeah, lamp.
- Here's a typewriter.

I love that.
Let's see... [imitating chainsaw, gunshots, screaming]
What was it, anyway?
The Rambo III soundtrack?
Gonna play it again?
Sure would like it.
Hey, maybe I could get a copy, and you could autograph it.

- I'll kick you in the ass again.
- Not now.
It's 'Nam Land.
- It's a hit.
It's a bang.
It's a smash.
- Shut him up, Bubba.
Did you see it?
Well, did you?
Didn't you?
Did you?
Didn't you?
Go check it out, boy.
- 'Nam Land!
- Oh, shut up!
I told you to go check it out, boy, before I start kicking your ass.
Some kind of crazy booger just skipped through here.
No, a booger?
How big?
[high-pitched] A big crazy booger.
Let's haul butt, bro.
[whispers] Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Franklin.
Don't you cry, my brother.
I'm here now.
They can't do this.
They can't do this!
They can't do this!
They can't do this!
I'll take you back to hell!
I'll take you to hell!
[whimpering]
- [saw buzzing] - [screams]
[screams] [panting]
[screaming] [shouting]
All right, all right!
Let's talk about it.
OK.
What, are you pissed-off?
What about me?
Listen, this is not gonna work out.
[sobbing]
I'm trying to be open with you.
It's nobody's fault.
I just can't do this.
Let me go.
What the hell's going on here?
Bubba, you nap-haired idiot.
Get out of here.
Who's this?
I get it.
Are you the saboteur that's fucking up our house?
Trying to put me out of business?
Thousands of dollars lost.
You got that kind of money?
No!
It's the deejay.
My fave.
That dirty thing?
Told me you boys got her.
[man] Well, yeah.
Leatherface killed her once already tonight.
But look, she's red-faced.
Bubba's been playing with her.
Bubba likes her.
Bubba's got a girlfriend.
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girl... [screams, laughs]
Is that what this is, Bubba?
The old cock-and-cunt swindle, huh?
S-C-E-X.
Sex.
And you had to find out about it, didn't you?
You just couldn't leave it alone.
If you wanted to know about it so bad, why didn't you ask me?
You wanna know about it?
You wanna know about it?
Ask me.
Ask me.
It's a swindle, that's all.
So don't get mixed up in it.
[sobbing] Help me.
Help me.
Help me.
Please, help me.
Please.
[imitating] Help me.
[sobbing] Please, help me.
All right, Miss Priss, cut that out.
Leave him alone, damn it!
Bubba, you were supposed to finish her.
Finish her now.
- Burn her like a rat.
- Finish her.
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her now.
Burn her like a rat!
Burn her like a rat, rat, rat!
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her now!
- Finish her now, Bubba!
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her!
- Finish her.
Finish her.
Give me that.
Turn traitor for a piece of tail.
You got one choice, boy, sex or the saw.
Sex is, well, nobody knows.
But the saw, the saw is family.
- The saw is family.
- Wait till Granddad hears about this.
Take her away.
- She's in the garbage now.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
- A-one... and a-two... and a-three!
[screaming] No!
[Drayton] Dinnertime, damn it!
Let's go.
Eat and run.
Eat and run.
There's a lot of hungry football fans to feed.
Hurry it up.
Grandpa likes to go fast.
He always did.
Come on.
Come on.
Time eats money.
Those damn coon shits are the weight of the family.
I stoop my shoulders taking care of my younger brothers.
It squashed the young years out of my life like a can of cheese whip.
I wouldn't wish this rotten life off on a one-eyed ferret with mange.
You're the first girl Bubba's brought home to dinner.
This is a real special occasion.
Grandpa sure looks forward to meeting you.
He's 137 years old but still as fast as Jesse James, so don't you worry none.
- Here comes Grandpa now.
- [Stretch screams]
God bless you, Grandpa.
It's playtime!
It's dinnertime!
Your little boys have some left here for you.
Yes, no, yes, no!
Yes, we do!
[Drayton, man] We love you!
We love you!
OK, now.
Take it easy, now.
Take it easy with Grandpa.
- That's right.
That's right.
- Get him over here easy, now.
- That's right.
OK.
- Come on, you boys.
- [Stretch screaming]
- Easy with Grandpa, now.
- Easy with Grandpa.
- No!
No!
[Stretch] Oh, please, no.
Don't rattle him like that, damn it!
You're balling up his shit.
[screaming] No!
Grandpa's strict liquid diet keeps him as fresh as a rose.
Every spring, the Atlas Rendering Company used to throw a big barbecue for Grandpa.
He was the master.
He was the one and only.
He showed us all the business.
We was raised in meat. [laughs]
But then after the glory, here comes the shame.
Atlas went for automation.
The electrified cages, the cold-steel chutes, the air-powered head hammers.
That drove Grandpa crazy, seeing things done like that.
Let me go!
Let me go!
No, no, that's all right.
That's all right.
It'll be over soon.
Get the hammer.
The crunching and the grinding, he just couldn't stand it, no way.
So that was all she wrote.
One morning, Grandpa just quit going in.
It was the shame.
It was the shame.
The shame.
There's more work to do.
Let's get on with it.
Right.
Let's get on with it.
Bingo!
Give me that.
Get that tub over there in a hurry.
Do I have to do every damn thing around here?
- You just sit tight.
- [screaming]
Bubba, she's ready.
Bring her on down.
[screaming] No!
- Oh, no!
- Bring her on down, damn it!
[Stretch] No!
No!
Bring her on down!
No!
No, no, no!
No, no, no!
Help me!
No, no, no!
Let me go!
You gotta let me go!
Let me go!
Please, help me!
- This will be one you won't forget.
- Please, help me!
It's a real honor.
Grandpa, he's a one-hitter.
And it's just like going home.
Please help me!
- No!
No!
No, God!
- [man imitating] No, no.
Help me!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Help me, please!
Please, help me!
Let's go see Grandpa, boy.
No, don't!
- No!
No, God!
- Come on.
Bring the bitch down.
- [screaming] - [groaning]
No!
No!
No, no, let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
No!
No!
No, no, no!
No!
Here come the judge.
Here come the judge.
No!
Now, don't ruin Grandpa's favorite rug.
Be careful of the splatter.
You gotta be careful of the splatter.
- Great-grandma in chainsaw heaven...
- No!
No!
God!
Please don't hoodoo the boy.
Hey, Grandpa, here's the big boy.
Look what Bubba brought you.
Hey, Grandpa, Bubba's got something to show you here.
Look, a Slurpee booty. [laughs]
- Hit her, Grandpa.
- Come on, Grandpa.
Let's see you do it.
Now, come on.
Come on, Grandpa.
You're the best.
- Hit her, Grandpa.
Hit her!
- Come on.
Hit her, Grandpa.
Come on, I'm telling you...
Remember those thieves?
Come on.
One-hitter.
- Come on, Grandpa.
- Hit her.
Hit her, Grandpa.
Come on, you won't miss her.
- [Grandpa groaning] - [screaming]
Come on, Grandpa.
Hit her.
Hit that bitch.
Hit that bitch.
Come on, Grandpa.
Come on, Grandpa.
You can do it.
You're the best.
Come on, there, Grandpa.
Come on, there, Grandpa.
Come on, Grandpa.
You can do it.
You're the best.
- Hit that bitch, Grandpa.
Hit her.
- [screaming]
Come on, Grandpa.
Hit her.
You are, Grandpa.
You're the best.
- [moaning]
- Yeah!
That's good, isn't it, Grandpa?
[screaming]
Grandpa!
- Attaboy, Grandpa.
- Hit that bitch, now, Grandpa.
- Come on, Grandpa.
You can do it.
- Get her now, Grandpa.
You can do it.
Come on, Grandpa.
[Stretch] No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Hit that bitch.
Hit that bitch!
Come on, Grandpa!
Oh, Grandpa, let's get on with it.
All right!
Slurpee-booty time!
[saw buzzing]
[Lefty singing in distance]
[man imitates singing]
Shut up!
What the hell's going on here?
[Lefty continues singing]
Boys, boys, boys.
What the hell's going on here?
Is that the American way of entering a man's home, singing like that?
I get it.
The old pressure game, huh?
Boys, you never should have been doing this.
Who sent you?
Those sissies over at Del-Mar Catering?
That chickenshit Burrito-Man bunch?
[laughs]
Well, I don't care, you hear?
Yeah, that's right.
It's a dog-eat-dog world.
And from where I sit, there just ain't enough damn dogs.
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the damn kitchen.
How much, huh?
Let's make a deal right here.
Real cash money.
Just you and me, huh?
I don't care who sent you.
I'm the Lord of the Harvest.
Who's that?
Some new health-food bunch?
Come on.
Come on.
Is there any money in it, you wanna know?
Yeah, right here.
How much?
How much?
- Lefty.
- Sister.
Lefty!
Brazos!
[screaming]
Run, sister.
Run.
- [screaming] - [man shouting, laughing]
[yelling]
Small businessman that... always, always, always gets it in the ass!
Sure...
Sure took care of my hems.
Saved a trip to the hospital.
Ah.
Looks...
Looks bad.
Sure burned my beans bad on that one.
[cackling]
[Leatherface screaming]
Maybe it's time to just shut down.
Time to shut down the show, yeah.
Yeah, pull the plug.
Come here, nubbins.
Where...
Where's that old "Fuck you, Charlie"?
[screaming]
[exhaling slowly] [shouting]
[groans] That little "Just in case, baby"?
Where'd you put it?
Ah!
Yeah, there it is.
Man...
Man builds a good, sturdy trade by hooking and crooking.
And then, kerplooey!
The gods just kick him right in the balls.
Oh, no, not this time.
[cackling] [screams]
No!
No!
- [man cackling] - [groaning]
Ah!
[groaning]
- [screaming, babbling] - [fizzling]
I got the last laugh right here.
[laughs] [both shouting]
Ah!
[shouting] [man cackling] [explosion]
[man] Going down, now!
[grunting, moaning]
[screaming]
Going down!
Going down, now!
Whoa!
[straining]
Here I come, you hog bitch!
You hog bitch!
Dead end, girl.
Dead end now.
Dead-end city.
Look at my face.
Look.
Look!
It's like death eating a cracker, isn't it?
Huh?
Huh?
!
No!
Get away from her!
Get away!
Don't touch her!
No!
- Grandma!
- [air escaping]
No!
Grandma!
Grandma!
Grandma!
You killed her, you hog bitch!
[both yelling]
[chainsaw starts]
Die!
[screaming]
[yelling]
[screaming hysterically]
[chainsaw buzzing]

- PSDH
Whoo!
- Oh, yeah!
- Hook them horns, baby!
We are on our way to the biggest party of the world.
Yeah!
Red River Rock 'n' Roll Request Line.
This is Stretch.
That's for Glen.
And could you tell the girls at Mesquite High just to leave him alone?
Got it, and I believe it.
Glen is off-limits now.
This is Stretch on an open request line on K-OKLA in Burkburnett, Texas,
Red River Rock 'n' Roll, from the tip-top of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.
Heck, let's give Stretch a call and see what she says.
- What kind of name is Stretch?
- No idea.
Red River Rock 'n' Roll Request Line.
This is Stretch.
Yo, Stretch!
It's the one and only Buzz.
And Rick the Prick!
And from all the senior boys at Wheeler High to all the senior girls, who are so stuck-up, play "You're on the Road to Nowhere."
No, you mean, "We're on the Road to Nowhere."
No, baby.
We're on the road to Texas-OU Weekend in Dallas!
You're on the road to nowhere!
Hook them horns, baby!
Whoo!
Real funny, guys.
OK, you wanna hang up now?
Tying up the line.
Hey, come on.
- No way, baby!
- We got a lot more requests!
Hey, check it out, dude.
Let's play a little chicken with the farmer here.
Whoo!
- Come on, baby!
Come on!
- Whoo-hoo!
Come on!
Come on, man.
- Come on!
- Whoo!
- Hot damn!
- Hook them horns!
Whoo!
That was great!
That was great!
You got that, babe?
Hot line?
You better stick with us, baby!
Yeah.
Later, sports.
Just hang up, OK?
No way!
Hook them horns!
Whoo!
- L.G.!
- Damn it, I'm trying, darling.
Don't call me darling, damn it.
Yow!
It's 8:11, Texas-time, on a Friday night.
I know nobody's listening because y'all are all zooming, but I got a shot of hot rock 'n' roll for you anyway.
"No One Lives Forever"]
K-OKLA, Red River Rock 'n' Roll Request.
What it is, Stretch?
This is the Buzz again.
Oh, not again.
Hang it up, lame-o.
Go call your mother.
Yeah, yeah, talk dirty.
But this is for Rick the Prick.
He wants to hear "Bright Lights, Big Titties."
Wrong.
I don't want to hear it.
I want to see it!
Bright lights, big titties!
Whoo!
L.G.?
L.G., get in here, please.
Whoo!
What the fuck?
Are you crazy?
Back up, pig fucker!
Come on.
Hurry up.
Get out of here!
- Oh, my God!
- They gotta hang up.
Step on it!
- Shit!
What the fuck?
- Come on, hurry up!
Hang up!
- What the hell is that?
- Look, it's some kind of geek.
- The geek's got a...
- Come on.
What is that?
- Shit!
- Come on.
Get out of here.
- Where'd he come from?
- I don't believe this shit!
Just keep driving.
Come on.
- Hey, let's go.
Come on.
- What the hell is that?
- Go on!
What's he doing?
- God damn it!
What's he got there?
Jesus Christ!
- What?
- Come on.
What is that?
- I don't believe this shit!
- Come on!
You can do it!
Come on!
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
- Holy shit!
- Come on, get out of here!
He's got a fucking chainsaw!
- Sounds like a buzz saw.
- Buzz saw?
Hey, hang up, man.
Hang up.
Hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up!
Get him.
Shoot the bastard.
Get him.
Shit!
Fuck!
Shoot that motherfucker, yeah!
Shit!
Keep back!
God!
Son of a bitch!
Shit!
Missed us, assholes.
What?
It just cut off.
Did you do that?
What happened?
It's like super feedback.
Just put the underwoofer across the overflapper.
I don't know.
Just went dead air.
- I want the license plate.
- No problem.
All right, now, ease up here.
You go get your pictures.
Watch out, Bob.
All right, keep the tension on that line.
Hey, loosen that chain.
We need some slack.
Easy.
Easy.
You, get out of there!
Three-zero.
Cowboy, get away from there.
This is an accident scene.
The area is restricted.
- Not gonna tell you...
- It's all right, Wendell.
Lieutenant Enright, sir.
We heard you might be headed this way.
Did you come over for the big game?
You know why I'm here.
Yes, sir, something about the chainsaw killers, your brother's kids killed.
But that was 14 years ago, sir, way down in South Texas.
Now, these are other kids.
This is just an accident.
Just a couple of wild punks out raising hell.
Yep.
One of those boys is so wild, sawed his own head off going 90 mile per hour.
Hell.
Hell's exactly what they raised.
No, sir, that information's off the record.
You know, sir, this is always a pretty hairy weekend for Dallas.
Whole lot of folks come to town and don't give a damn about football.
You know, they just wanna go blood crazy for a few and riot.
You know what "riot" means.
You were a Ranger.
I can't hardly keep them down by law, and if...
If you go around promoting this chainsaw...
Try to speak plain.
Saves time.
I have authority from the DA's office to put you right back on the next plane to Amarillo.
Well, you just do that, son.
I'd like to see that authority.
All right, Lieutenant Enright, what's your deal?
All right.
I'm gonna ask some questions.
Put it in the press.
Get it in the news.
Any information about this accident... and maybe some witnesses.
Yes, sir, I...
I know some old boys at the paper.
We'll get your story out for you.
Brazos.
Brazos!
Remember the Alamo, cowboy.
I won!
Wanna fuck?
Asshole.
You need a witness?
I'm a witness.
This Mercedes?
I think I was talking to those kids when it happened.
No way was that an accident.
- You saw it.
- No, but I heard it.
You can listen.
It's here on tape.
Oh, shit.
Come on.
Regulations.
We gotta record all the call-ins.
End of the night, we wipe the tapes, but I kept this one just 'cause...
It just got to me.
- We got professionals working...
- I didn't know what I heard, but I read your story.
What you're looking for
- is on this tape.
- ...so don't fool with it.
You can slow it down now.
You're just a joke in this morning's paper.
"Cowboy chases chainsaws 14 years.
Dallas police refuse comment."
Like you're, you know, hung up on something crazy.
But I believe you.
I might be the only believer you got.
- 'Cause it's right here.
- What is?
Right on here, those kids getting killed.
Now, this is evidence, sort of, right?
Yeah, it's time for you to go home.
- No, wait a minute.
- Come on.
Look, I came here because I thought I could help you.
I deejay this dumb show on K-OKLA up in Burkburnett, but people listen to me all across North Texas.
Now, I could put you on the radio, get people to believe you, get you some help.
You're gonna get in my way.
- Don't you get in my way.
- No, I'm already right in the middle of this.
This is my chance to stop playing head-banging music and do something real.
Well, I don't need anybody to stand with me, all right?
You can't do it alone.
I got a perfect willingness to die.
That gives me a moral on this bunch of mad dogs.
They live on fear.
They thrive on it.
I ain't got no fear left.
Adios.
I ain't got no fear, Lord.
- Hardass.
- Hardass?
Me?
Well, maybe a semi-hardass, but I got a soft heart.
Looky.
- Built you a little fry house.
- L.G.!
What, darling?
Oh, L.G.
OK, everybody, hush up.
Listen up, y'all.
The Texas-OU Chili Cook-off champion is
- from Norman, Oklahoma?
No.
- No!
Waco, Texas?
Mm-mm.
Tulsa?
Nope.
- Pardon me.
- Austin?
Uh-uh.
He's Dallas' favorite caterer, and I think he's kind of cute.
The Last Round-up Rolling Grill chef,
Drayton Sawyer!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Drayton!
Drayton!
It's the second year in a row.
This year, Drayton, you've got to tell the secret of that fabulously tasty chili!
No secret.
It's the meat.
Don't skimp on the meat.
I got a real good eye for prime meat.
Runs in the family.
Whoop!
Whoop!
It's one of those, uh, hard-shell peppercorns.
I gotta say, I love this town.
This town loves prime meat!
So there's the big story.
Texas clobbers Oklahoma in chili.
This is Stretch, your fearless reporter, live from Dallas.
Now, be sure to watch your drinking and driving on this wild and woolly Texas-OU Weekend.
This is Stretch, on K-OKLA...
Cut-Rite.
No, C.L., I ain't seen Fletcher.
Well, last Friday.
Well, hell, he's on the road, then.
Well, don't believe me, then.
Fine.
C.L...
No.
I'll be with you in just a minute, sir.
Now, you're getting as mean as a sting bat, C.L.
No, hell, don't call back.
No, don't you call back.
I got a business here, and Fletcher ain't none of my business.
Damn!
What can I do you for?
Well, don't you wanna test them?
There's gas in them.
Get them suckers a time or two.
Oh, my kid banana.
Damn, what is he doing?
Now, this is very hard to believe.
I'd like you to play that tape, missy.
Come all the way up here to Burkburnett.
No shit!
Yeah.
Oh, you wanna hear it now.
I wanna hear it on the radio.
On your show.
Uh-uh.
I don't think it'd be legal to do that.
FCC regulations, those things.
Well, you just figure out how to do it and do it.
You bend the rules.
I don't know.
Huh!
- Why?
- Because the killers are here.
Kill sites have been clustered all over Northeast Texas the last two years.
The laws, they shy away from piecing it together as murder.
They call it accidents, disappearances.
You got that last slaughter on tape.
You play it on the radio.
Maybe then, the laws will stop trying to shut me up and start helping me.
Besides, it'll give you something real to do.
You said you were gonna do this alone.
I need your help, missy.
Well... you can call me Stretch, Mr. Enright.
Well, now, you can call me Lefty.
It's mighty nice doing business with you.
- Thanks.
- All right.
You have a nice day, now.
You, too.
♪ Number one again!

So here's a special request we're doing this afternoon and tonight.
You steady listeners know we're playing this every hour.
This is for Lefty.
Hog fucker!
Son of a bitch!
Ah!
Last Round-up Rolling Grill.
We're still number one.
I told you, boys, and I told you.
Don't call on this phone.
Now, damn it, get off.
What?
What's on the radio?
Now, don't bullshit me.
I can't...
I won't...
All right, what station?
This ain't no joke, boy?
Then I'm tuning it in.
Hog fucker!
Son of a bitch!
You two nap-haired idiots.
You've done it again!
You coon shits!
You fudge-packers!
You'll be the death of me yet!
Missed us, assholes.
K-OKLA.
Come on, Lefty.
Where are you?
This concludes the broadcast day for K-OKLA in Burkburnett, Texas,
Red River Rock 'n' Roll.
In New York, it's 1:00am, still fun city.
In LA, 10:00 at night, party time.
But deep in the heart of Texas, it's 12:00 midnight.
Ain't nothing going on.
It's another cussing caller.
Your little ass is gonna be in big trouble over that tape, girl.
Nope.
Sure got a lot of complaints, darling.
L.G., it was a request, right?
It's listed in the logs as a request.
People complain about the request every night, right?
Uh-huh.
Wanna go for coffee at Big State?
Nope.
Huh, I guess you're waiting on this guy, Lefty?
L.G.
Night, L.G.
Good night.
God damn it!
Shit!
K-OKLA, this is Stretch.
Hello?
Hello, Lefty?
L.G.?
Lefty?
I wanna buy some radio-ad time.
Are you fucking crazy?
We are closed!
Off the air till tomorrow.
You'll have to just come back.
No, but...
But, yeah, but...
Whoa!
So this is radio land, huh?
The infinite turnover?
The waves through the ether fuzz roll on forever.
Roar!
Can't close that.
Hi, I know what you're thinking.
"This is weird.
Hope I can handle it."
You know... you're my fave.
Me and Bubba, my little brother, we listen to you every night.
Music is my life.
You know, you're my fave, but I get too embarrassed to phone in my request.
It's too disembodied, you know?
But...
Now that we're here in flesh and blood,
I could maybe make a request, and it'd still count, huh?
Sure.
Mm-hm.
Well, what about...
Iron Butterfly?
You know, like "In-A-Vida-Da-Gadda, Baby?"
It's heavy!
You know,
I've never been to a radio station before.
Do you think you could do me a tour, huh?
Tour?
Tour.
Sure, sure.
But seriously quick, and it ends at the exit sign.
Oh, boy!
OK, yeah, sure!
OK, your tour.
Here's your tour.
Here's your tour.
Here's a lamp.
Yeah, lamp.
- Here's a typewriter.
- Oh!
- Rubber man.
- Uh-huh.
Rubber man.
I like him.
Armadillo.
Here's Mr. Shark.
Oh, Mr. Shark!
- Here's some flowers.
- Flowers.
Rolodex.
- Here's a lamp.
- Oh!
And there's the exit sign.
Tour's over.
Oh...
"E-X..."
I-T.
"Exit."
- Good night.
- Oh.
Good night!
Good night!
Good night.
Good night!
Good night.
Hey, what about my request?
You know.
That Lefty-request record that you honked out today?
I love that.
Let's see...
What was it, anyway?
The Rambo III soundtrack?
Gonna play it again?
Sure would like it.
Hey, maybe I could get a copy, and you could autograph it.
To a... a far-out fan!
- What's in here?
- Record vault.
Oh, where you keep the golden oldies?
And, uh, maybe...
Maybe the new music's in...
Ow!
Not me, you dumb-ass!
Get the girl!
Get the girl!
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
He dented my plate!
Ah!
My brain is burning!
'Nam flashback!
'Nam flashback!
Leatherface, you bitch, I'll...
Look what you did to my Sonny Bono wig-do.
God damn, I can't believe it!
You gonna have to buy me a new plate cover!
You gonna have to buy me a new plate cover, Leatherface.
Oh!
He's gonna send me back to the VA Hospital with this dent in my plate.
Well, at least he didn't mess me up.
Dog will hunt.
Get that bitch, Leatherface.
Get that bitch!
Dog will hunt.
Go away!
Shit.
Humble Pie!
Hurry up, Leatherface.
Hurry up.
Get that bitch!
Go away!
Music is my life!
Ah!
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
They live on fear.
They live on fear.

Stretch, darling, you know the door's unlocked?
Hey!
What the shit?
Hey!
Lick my plate, you dog dick!
What the fuck you think you're doing in here, you crazy-looking little son of a bitch?
Get out of here!
Time for incoming mail!
Ho Chi Minh!
A-one and a-two and a-three!
Go, you little bitch!
Go away!
Leave me alone!
No, no, no, no!
God, no, please don't!

Are you mad at me?
How mad at me are you?
You're not really mad at me.
How good are you?
Huh?
Get that bitch, Leatherface!
Get that bitch!
How good... are you?
Oh.
Really?
Are you really, really... good?
Are you really good?
Really good?
You're really good.
You're the best.
Oh, no.

Please don't kill me!
No, God!
No, please, God!
No, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Leatherface.
Did you get her, Bubba?
Did you get that bitch?
She was my fave, but she knew.
And now, nobody knows.
Look what you did to my plate, you bitch!
You got her?
Did you get her good?
Slap me five.
I got one, too.
A bonus body!
Look at that beef.
Help me get it out of here.
Oh!
Ooh...
Giddyup!
No, they'll get away.
No, no, they'll get away.
They can't get away.
God damn it, Lefty.
You're late.
Damn it, Lefty.
Oh!
Stretch!
Lefty?
Stretch!
Hold on!
Grab onto something.
Hold onto it.
Lefty, they came!
Where were you?
I had to do it.
Damn, I used you, girl.
I'm here now.
Grab hold of this.
Grab hold of this, now.
Don't you cry, little sister.
I'm here now.
Come on, I'm here now.
You can get it.
Come on, now.
You got it.
Come on.
Come on!
Grab it!
Oh, my God.
Oh, Lord, help me beat this stranger that walks beside me, that takes away my strength.
Lord, you show me the end.
Show me what I fear so I don't fear it no more.
It's the devil's playground.
I'm bringing it down!
Down to hell!
Bring it all down!
I hate to say it, but that hillbilly hog you boys got earlier is the top tonight.
That's mine!
Mine!
Not Bubba's.
Me!
Me!
Bust it up!
Wanna go to the movies?
No crowds.
Everybody's at the football parties.
Tonight's a washout.
Biggest meat-eater weekend of the month, and we're gonna lose money on it.
Damn it all!
Maybe we just ought to quit.
Oh, yeah?
Kiss my plate, Mr. Big Shot.
Maybe you forgot.
This chrome dome bankrolled this food business.
No lucky gook with a machete, no head wound.
No head wound, no fancy rolling grill a-go-go.
Ain't no fool.
Kiss it.
Don't forget it.
Peel that pig and slice him thick.
- That's my sweet pea.
- Get them hogs on the grill.
Big, big pre-game brunch tomorrow means a ton of croissant sandwiches.
Oh, I love this town.
Hey, you nitwit, get back in here and get that grill going.
No.
No.
No good.
No good.
Come on, Bubba.
Cook's out here, and he's chewing ass like it was steak.
"You gotta run for that money now.
Chase that dollar.
Gotta go fast to catch it."
You dumb baboons are too dumb to even close the door.
I'm tired of kicking your asses.
What are you doing?
You trying to hide something?
Get that eyeball pâté working.
Hey, you coon shit, where are you going?
We need the club sandwiches...
Help.
Help me.
Please.
Please, help me.
Can you help me get out of here?
What is it?
Put that down.
Put that down.
Put that down.
What is that?
Is it wet?
It's wet.
Put it down.
My darling.
Darling?
Don't be scared, darling.
Oh no, L.G.
Oh no.
Oh no.
L.G.!
Oh, my God!
L.G., they got you, too?
Oh, L.G.!
We gotta get y'all loose.
I guess I'm falling apart on you, honey.
No.
No.
Shit.
L.G.
I love you.
So he says,
"Hey, get me those lawyers.
Legal meat."
- Legal meat, yeah!
- Bubba, you idiot!
Get your ass over here.
- You fucked up again.
- You fucked up again.
He says, "Hey, get me those lawyers.
Legal meat, y'all."
Fuck me in the left eye!
Valuable kill-time wasted running down them coked-up pencil necks, and not a good chop on the whole bunch.
I pick the vittles.
Get it?
- I. Me.
Nobody but...
- I pick the vittles, I.
- Bubba, you hull wreckage!
- Me.
Nobody but...
Busted again, huh?
That's the main support beam.
Fuck, you idiots!
You both will pay!
Both of you...
You're both...
Look what your brother's done now.
You coon shit.
You cut the main support beam.
And this is what happens.
Of course this is what happens.
That big brute!
Dirty meat don't cut it.
Family standards only require the best meat in town.
More money lost.
I never, never, never get a break.
Work, work night and day, presenting myself to the people, selling, selling.
You pair of prima donnas fooling around here and listening to the radio all day and sawing down your own house.
Take it all down!
Bring it all down!
Bury the devil!
May the Lord have mercy on our souls!
Ah!
Get that thing out of here.
Maybe it cracked the main butane tank.
It's up there.
Go look at it.
Taxes.
Taxes.
Damn property taxes fuck up everything.
Crooks don't pay taxes.
Politicians don't.
Movie stars don't.
It's the little guy that can't make a dime.
He pays the taxes.
Small businessman gets it in the ass every time.
I ought to quit.
Right, it's junk.
Quit.
Dump this cook show.
Sell off this turkey.
It's time.
It's in the air.
It's what the public wants.
I don't wanna hear that again.
It's 'Nam Land!
Yow!
What the hell was that?
I don't know, boy.
It looked like a big, big fireball.
'Nam Land.
Napalm.
Fire in the hole.
That's the main butane tank up there, Bubba.
Go look at it.
Get your butt moving, boy.
Go up there and look at it.
Go look at it.
- I'll kick you in the ass again.
- Not now.
It's 'Nam Land.
- It's a hit.
It's a bang.
It's a smash.
- Shut him up, Bubba.
Did you see it?
Well, did you?
Didn't you?
Did you?
Didn't you?
Go check it out, boy.
- 'Nam Land!
- Oh, shut up!
I told you to go check it out, boy, before I start kicking your ass.
Some kind of crazy booger just skipped through here.
No, a booger?
How big?
A big crazy booger.
Let's haul butt, bro.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Franklin.
Don't you cry, my brother.
I'm here now.
They can't do this.
They can't do this!
They can't do this!
They can't do this!
I'll take you back to hell!
I'll take you to hell!
All right, all right!
Let's talk about it.
OK.
What, are you pissed-off?
What about me?
Listen, this is not gonna work out.
I'm trying to be open with you.
It's nobody's fault.
I just can't do this.
Let me go.
What the hell's going on here?
Bubba, you nap-haired idiot.
Get out of here.
Who's this?
I get it.
Are you the saboteur that's fucking up our house?
Trying to put me out of business?
Thousands of dollars lost.
You got that kind of money?
No!
It's the deejay.
My fave.
That dirty thing?
Told me you boys got her.
Well, yeah.
Leatherface killed her once already tonight.
But look, she's red-faced.
Bubba's been playing with her.
Bubba likes her.
Bubba's got a girlfriend.
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girl...
Is that what this is, Bubba?
The old cock-and-cunt swindle, huh?
S-C-E-X.
Sex.
And you had to find out about it, didn't you?
You just couldn't leave it alone.
If you wanted to know about it so bad, why didn't you ask me?
You wanna know about it?
You wanna know about it?
Ask me.
Ask me.
It's a swindle, that's all.
So don't get mixed up in it.
Help me.
Help me.
Help me.
Please, help me.
Please.
Help me.
Please, help me.
All right, Miss Priss, cut that out.
Leave him alone, damn it!
Bubba, you were supposed to finish her.
Finish her now.
- Burn her like a rat.
- Finish her.
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her now.
Burn her like a rat!
Burn her like a rat, rat, rat!
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her now!
- Finish her now, Bubba!
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her!
- Finish her.
Finish her.
Give me that.
Turn traitor for a piece of tail.
You got one choice, boy, sex or the saw.
Sex is, well, nobody knows.
But the saw, the saw is family.
- The saw is family.
- Wait till Granddad hears about this.
Take her away.
- She's in the garbage now.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
- A-one... and a-two... and a-three!
No!
Dinnertime, damn it!
Let's go.
Eat and run.
Eat and run.
There's a lot of hungry football fans to feed.
Hurry it up.
Grandpa likes to go fast.
He always did.
Come on.
Come on.
Time eats money.
Those damn coon shits are the weight of the family.
I stoop my shoulders taking care of my younger brothers.
It squashed the young years out of my life like a can of cheese whip.
I wouldn't wish this rotten life off on a one-eyed ferret with mange.
You're the first girl Bubba's brought home to dinner.
This is a real special occasion.
Grandpa sure looks forward to meeting you.
He's 137 years old but still as fast as Jesse James, so don't you worry none.
Here comes Grandpa now.
God bless you, Grandpa.
It's playtime!
It's dinnertime!
Your little boys have some left here for you.
Yes, no, yes, no!
Yes, we do!
We love you!
We love you!
OK, now.
Take it easy, now.
Take it easy with Grandpa.
- That's right.
That's right.
- Get him over here easy, now.
- That's right.
OK.
- Come on, you boys.
Easy with Grandpa, now.
- Easy with Grandpa.
- No!
No!
Oh, please, no.
Don't rattle him like that, damn it!
You're balling up his shit.
No!
Grandpa's strict liquid diet keeps him as fresh as a rose.
Every spring, the Atlas Rendering Company used to throw a big barbecue for Grandpa.
He was the master.
He was the one and only.
He showed us all the business.
We was raised in meat.
But then after the glory, here comes the shame.
Atlas went for automation.
The electrified cages, the cold-steel chutes, the air-powered head hammers.
That drove Grandpa crazy, seeing things done like that.
Let me go!
Let me go!
No, no, that's all right.
That's all right.
It'll be over soon.
Get the hammer.
The crunching and the grinding, he just couldn't stand it, no way.
So that was all she wrote.
One morning, Grandpa just quit going in.
It was the shame.
It was the shame.
The shame.
There's more work to do.
Let's get on with it.
Right.
Let's get on with it.
Bingo!
Give me that.
Get that tub over there in a hurry.
Do I have to do every damn thing around here?
You just sit tight.
Bubba, she's ready.
Bring her on down.
No!
- Oh, no!
- Bring her on down, damn it!
No!
No!
Bring her on down!
No!
No, no, no!
No, no, no!
Help me!
No, no, no!
Let me go!
You gotta let me go!
Let me go!
Please, help me!
- This will be one you won't forget.
- Please, help me!
It's a real honor.
Grandpa, he's a one-hitter.
And it's just like going home.
Please help me!
- No!
No!
No, God!
- No, no.
Help me!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Help me, please!
Please, help me!
Let's go see Grandpa, boy.
No, don't!
- No!
No, God!
- Come on.
Bring the bitch down.
No!
No!
No, no, let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
No!
No!
No, no, no!
No!
Here come the judge.
Here come the judge.
No!
Now, don't ruin Grandpa's favorite rug.
Be careful of the splatter.
You gotta be careful of the splatter.
- Great-grandma in chainsaw heaven...
- No!
No!
God!
Please don't hoodoo the boy.
Hey, Grandpa, here's the big boy.
Look what Bubba brought you.
Hey, Grandpa, Bubba's got something to show you here.
Look, a Slurpee booty.
- Hit her, Grandpa.
- Come on, Grandpa.
Let's see you do it.
Now, come on.
Come on, Grandpa.
You're the best.
- Hit her, Grandpa.
Hit her!
- Come on.
Hit her, Grandpa.
Come on, I'm telling you...
Remember those thieves?
Come on.
One-hitter.
- Come on, Grandpa.
- Hit her.
Hit her, Grandpa.
Come on, you won't miss her.
Come on, Grandpa.
Hit her.
Hit that bitch.
Hit that bitch.
Come on, Grandpa.
Come on, Grandpa.
You can do it.
You're the best.
Come on, there, Grandpa.
Come on, there, Grandpa.
Come on, Grandpa.
You can do it.
You're the best.
Hit that bitch, Grandpa.
Hit her.
Come on, Grandpa.
Hit her.
You are, Grandpa.
You're the best.
Yeah!
That's good, isn't it, Grandpa?
Grandpa!
- Attaboy, Grandpa.
- Hit that bitch, now, Grandpa.
- Come on, Grandpa.
You can do it.
- Get her now, Grandpa.
You can do it.
Come on, Grandpa.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Hit that bitch.
Hit that bitch!
Come on, Grandpa!
Oh, Grandpa, let's get on with it.
All right!
Slurpee-booty time!
Shut up!
What the hell's going on here?
Boys, boys, boys.
What the hell's going on here?
Is that the American way of entering a man's home, singing like that?
I get it.
The old pressure game, huh?
Boys, you never should have been doing this.
Who sent you?
Those sissies over at Del-Mar Catering?
That chickenshit Burrito-Man bunch?
Well, I don't care, you hear?
Yeah, that's right.
It's a dog-eat-dog world.
And from where I sit, there just ain't enough damn dogs.
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the damn kitchen.
How much, huh?
Let's make a deal right here.
Real cash money.
Just you and me, huh?
I don't care who sent you.
I'm the Lord of the Harvest.
Who's that?
Some new health-food bunch?
Come on.
Come on.
Is there any money in it, you wanna know?
Yeah, right here.
How much?
How much?
- Lefty.
- Sister.
Lefty!
Brazos!
Run, sister.
Run.
Small businessman that... always, always, always gets it in the ass!
Sure...
Sure took care of my hems.
Saved a trip to the hospital.
Ah.
Looks...
Looks bad.
Sure burned my beans bad on that one.
Maybe it's time to just shut down.
Time to shut down the show, yeah.
Yeah, pull the plug.
Come here, nubbins.
Where...
Where's that old "Fuck you, Charlie"?
That little "Just in case, baby"?
Where'd you put it?
Ah!
Yeah, there it is.
Man...
Man builds a good, sturdy trade by hooking and crooking.
And then, kerplooey!
The gods just kick him right in the balls.
Oh, no, not this time.
No!
No!
Ah!
I got the last laugh right here.
Ah!
Going down, now!
Going down!
Going down, now!
Whoa!
Here I come, you hog bitch!
You hog bitch!
Dead end, girl.
Dead end now.
Dead-end city.
Look at my face.
Look.
Look!
It's like death eating a cracker, isn't it?
Huh?
Huh?
!
No!
Get away from her!
Get away!
Don't touch her!
No!
Grandma!
No!
Grandma!
Grandma!
Grandma!
You killed her, you hog bitch!
Die!

We should've talked at the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk about it here.
I'm not falling all over myself to talk about it much of anywhere, Jack.
How much do you know?
Not much.
The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago.
The second one in Atlanta was all over TV.
Did you ever think about giving me a call?
No.
Why not?
I quit.
Remember?
You look all right now.
I am all right.
If you can't look anymore, I understand.
Don't try to run a game down on me, Jack.
If I really didn't need you to come back, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks and a few days until the next full moon.
We have a better chance to get him fast if you help.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
Hi, Molly.
Think it'll keep them out, Dad?
Yep.
How many turtle eggs do you think are in here?
In this hatchery?
I'll bet there's 40 or 50 of them.
Crabs get most of the newborns, huh?
Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it, guaranteed.
What about the dogs?
Are they gonna get in here?
They can't dig under.
That's why we bury the wire down in the sand.
We need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be his friend, Jack.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, Molly, I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.
We got it pretty good, don't we?
We have it more than good.
All that happened to you before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only look at evidence.
I wouldn't get deeply involved.
He'd never even see me or know my name.
If they find him, they'll have to take him down, not me.
What do you think?
I think you've already decided and you're not really asking.
If I were asking?
Stay here with me, me and Kevin.
But it's selfish, and I know it.
Come here.
I'll come inside with you, if you want, to show you around.
Mr. Crawford said maybe you'd want to be alone, but...
That's right.
There's a VCR hooked up in your hotel room.
They transferred some home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen sliding door.
Used a glass cutter anchored to a suction cup.
His entry was skillful.
All the prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair, strong, size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood AB positive, typed from saliva on glass from licking the suction cup.
Why didn't he care that he left saliva on the glass?
It was hot out that night, so inside the house must have felt cool to him.
Intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he was rising, then shot Mrs. Leeds.
Bullet entered right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation.
Moderate elevation of serotonin and marked increase of free histamine level in gunshot wound indicates she lived at least five minutes after she was shot.
All her other injuries were post-mortem.
Direction and velocity of bloodstains on east wall indicate arterial spray.
Even with his throat cut, Leeds tried to fight because the intruder was moving to the children's room.
Bloodstains on west wall of master bedroom and matted sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained,
as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leeds' chest, also believed to be post-mortem.
What did the killer do with them after they were dead?
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry, I can't come to the phone right now, but if you'd like to leave a message please do so after the beep, and I'll call you back as soon as I can.
Twenty-ninth floor.
Going up.
When they were dead, he smashed the mirrors and began selecting pieces that he would use later on Mrs. Leeds.
Killing Mr. Leeds and the children would take less than a minute.
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem, four or five minutes later.
What did he do in the interval?
The smeared bloodstains on the west wall...
Hello?
Molly?
will, is that you?
Yeah, it's me, honey.
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
I love you.
I love you too, baby.
What are you dreaming?
That's something you can't afford for me to know about, isn't it?
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
It was maddening to have to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg, but there wasn't any talcum powder in the bathroom.
The talcum powder came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You touched her with your bare hands, and then you put your gloves back on.
But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so that they could see you?
hello?
Jack, this is Graham.
is Price still in Latent Prints?
Yeah, he's in charge of the single Print Index now.
What do you got, Will?
Get him to Atlanta.
atlanta PD swears they dusted everything, and their guy is pretty good.
He is good.
He's not as good as Price.
I'll get him on a plane in the morning.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails and the corneas of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves.
Our people swear he wore surgeon's gloves the whole time.
They dusted everything.
Your report didn't mention eyes.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
Because Mrs. Leeds was a beautiful woman.
This is what the subject's teeth looked like.
The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed these from the impressions that we took of the bite marks on the Leeds woman here and the Jacobi woman in Birmingham last month.
As you can see, he has pegged lateral incisors, that's these teeth here and here.
Vice and Narcotics, you take the K-Y cowboys and leather bars.
Marcus, Whitman, heads up at the funeral.
The rest of your assignments are on the sheet.
Let's go.
One more thing.
I've heard officers referring to this killer as the Tooth Fairy.
Well, I don't want to hear that in public, and I don't want to see it in internal memoranda.
That's it.
I know a burglar's gonna fence what he stole 'cause his motive is cash money.
I know his motive, so I go to work on fences.
This guy, we don't even have motive.
None of us have shit, and we know it.
It's in his dreams.
His motive?
Yeah.
His act fuels his fantasy.
Which is?
I don't know.
The commissioner was saying that you're the one who got Garrett Jacob Hobbs, and then Dr. Lecktor three years ago.
Lecktor killed nine people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
One's on a respirator at a hospital in Baltimore, the other's in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
The psychologists call him a psychopath.
They don't know what else to call him.
I understand he cut you pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's.
The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen.
The Jacobis in Birmingham had a cat, didn't they?
That's right.
We found a litter box downstairs, but we didn't find a cat.
Why don't you get Birmingham PD a methane probe out of Washington, have them cover the back yard.
Maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
Yeah?
This is Jimmy Price, fbi.
Let me put you on speakerphone.
Who am I talking to?
Jimmy, it's Jack Crawford.
You got Will Graham here, too.
I got a partial print with a tented arch, it's probably a thumb.
And the fragment of a palm off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.
Thumbprint came off the oldest kid's left eye.
It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.
Can we make an identification off of it?
Maybe, if he's ever been printed and he's in my index.
I want to work these up in my own darkroom.
I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon.
Thanks, Jimmy.
No comment.
If we get lucky with that print, we're in, if Jimmy can find him in the index and if he's ever been printed.
If not, I don't know.
Hey, Will Graham!
What do you say?
You remember me?
Freddie Lounds, covered the Lecktor case for the Tattler, did the paperback.
So, Will, when did they call you in?
What do you got?
Hey, look, I'm buying lunch.
Lounds, why don't you give it a rest?
Hey, he's news.
I'm doing my job.
So, how does this guy compare with Lecktor?
How does he do them?
How's he do them, Will?
Keep the fuck away from me.
Will, Will.
Son of a bitch snuck into the hospital while I was sedated after Lecktor.
He pulled back the sheets, and he took pictures.
Yeah, I know.
Look, don't expect too much from me, all right?
We only got three weeks left, and you're our best shot.
You think I'm gonna see him standing in the street and say, "There he is"?
That's Houdini you're thinking about.
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on until we get smart or get lucky.
He won't stop.
Why?
He's got a genuine taste for it.
You do know something about him.
Not enough.
I think I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mindset.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Yeah, I keep getting it for Christmas.
Did you get my card?
I got it.
Thank you.
How is Officer Stewart?
The one who was first to see my basement.
Stewart's fine.
Emotional problems, I hear.
Do you have any problems, Will?
No.
No, of course you don't.
I'm glad you came.
My callers are mostly clinical psychologists from cornfield universities somewhere.
Second-raters, the lot.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the Journal of clinical Psychiatry.
And?
Very interesting.
Even to a layman.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Yes, I thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Yes?
You read about it?
In the papers.
I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
I thought you might have some ideas.
Why should I tell you?
You'd get to see the file on this case.
And there's another reason.
Pray tell.
Thought you might be curious to see if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
Then by implication you think you're smarter than me, since you caught me.
No. I know that I'm not smarter than you.
Then how did you catch me?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantages?
You're insane.
You are very tan, Will.
Your hands are rough.
They don't look like cop's hands anymore.
And that shaving lotion is something a child would select.
It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it?
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
I don't think I'll persuade you at all.
You'll either do it or you won't.
Besides, we have Dr. Bloom working on it, and he's the best.
Do you have the file with you?
Yes.
Pictures?
Yes.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
No.
Dream much, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file, and I'll tell you what I think.
This is a very shy boy, Will.
What were their yards like?
Big back yards.
Fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, my dear Will, if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he might go outside to look at it.
Have you ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy for this sort of thing.
That's interesting.
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.
I considered it.
You came here to look at me, to get the old scent back again, didn't you?
I want your opinion.
I don't have one right now.
Well, when you have one, I'd like to hear it.
Can I keep this?
I haven't decided yet.
I'll study them.
When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too.
You can call me.
When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone.
Would you like to leave me your home phone number?
No.
Do you know how you caught me?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You can leave messages for me.
Do you know how you caught me?
The reason you caught me, Will, is we're just alike.
Do you understand?
Smell yourself.
Gotcha.
..217 now boarding at Gate 12.
Eastern airlines Flight 217 is now ready for boarding at Gate 12.
Get up against the bunk and face the wall.
Don't turn around, or I'll Mace you in the face.
Thank you so much.
I'll call you when I'm finished.
Are you ready for your call?
Yes, thank you.
Paltrow, Christiansen Golub, Law Offices.
Excuse me.
I must have misdialed.
Thank you for using ATT.
This is Operator 24.
Operator, I don't have the use of my arms.
Would you be so kind as to dial a number for me, please?
certainly.
What's the number?
Area code 301, 555-6624.
The University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry.
Dr. Sidney Bloom, please.
He's not in, but I'll connect you to his office.
What's his secretary's name again?
Martha King.
Just a moment, please.
Martha King's desk.
Hi, Martha.
Martha doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob Greer of Blaine Edwards publishing company,
Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of The Psychiatrist and the Law to someone.
Martha never sent me the address and phone number.
She'II be in in the morning.
Well, I've got to catch Federal Express in about five minutes.
I'd be immensely appreciative if you could pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
I don't see a rolodex.
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Yeah...
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
All right.
The name we're looking for, last name Graham, the man the book is supposed to be sent to, a Mr. Will Graham.
federal Bureau of lnvestigation, 10th and Pennsylvania,
Washington, D.C.
Now, I'll bet it has his home address there, too.
3680 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, florida.
Thank you so very much.
I've finished.
Mom!
Oh, my gosh.
It's all right.
Stewardess!
Ladies and gentlemen, we are beginning our descent into Birmingham.
You used a cutting tool on the branch so that you could see.
Then you passed the time whittling and dreaming.
When night came, you saw them pass by their bright windows.
Then you watched the shades go down, then you saw the lights go out, one by one.
Then after a while, you climbed down and you went in to them, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You watched them all goddamned day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
I need Firearms and Tool Marks section out here on a severed branch.
I need to know what kind of cutting tool he used.
And then I need Bowman in Documents to fall on this carving.
Is it weird?
The mark?
Yeah.
If Documents can't do the carving, I'll send it up to Langley.
Did Price get an identification off the Leeds print?
No, Price hasn't found him in the index yet.
It's a hand search.
He's got half his department on it.
Listen, have you seen this week's Tattler?
It's not on my preferred reading list.
Well, your picture's all over the front page.
Who the hell was it?
Lounds?
Of course.
Who else?
God damn it, Jack!
I promised Molly!
I promised her!
Come in.
Dr. Chilton?
Yes?
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lecktor's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book.
We got him out of there and dug around.
is that it?
Yes.
Put it down on my desk, Bonner.
Has anyone else seen this except you?
No.
special Agent Crawford's office.
This is Dr. Chilton.
I need to speak to Mr. Graham right away.
He's not here, he's in Birmingham.
special Agent Crawford is on the line with him now.
Please tell them this is very, very urgent.
I'll hold on.
Dr. Chilton, it's Jack Crawford.
You have Will Graham on the line, too.
I have a note, or two pieces of a note that appears to be from that man who killed those people in Atlanta.
Where did you get it?
In Hannibal Lecktor's cell.
It was hidden in a book.
Don't touch the note.
Can you read it to us?
It's written on toilet tissue.
"My dear Dr. Lecktor,
"l wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me.
"l know that you alone can understand what I am becoming.
"You alone know the people I use to help me in these things
"are only elements undergoing change
"to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming,
"just as the source of light is burning.
"l have a collection of your press clippings.
"l think they are absurd, as are mine.
"'The Tooth Fairy,' what could be more inappropriate?
"Investigator Graham interests me,
"very purposeful-looking.
"l hope we can correspond."
There's a piece missing here.
Now I'll read the bottom part.
"After I hear back from you,
"l might send you something wet."
Signed "Avid Fan."
It has teeth marks pressed into it at the bottom.
Order a chopper, next thing smoking.
I don't care whose it is.
Two, call Alabama Air National Guard, get Graham back here right now.
Then call Documents and tell them to scramble a team.
I want everybody moving five minutes ago.
You understand?
I have a Documents team on its way to you by helicopter to pick up the note.
Listen, after we've worked the note, I want to replace it in Lecktor's cell.
I don't want Lecktor to know that we've found it, he might try to warn the killer somehow.
Where's Lecktor now?
holding cell.
How long can you keep him in there without him getting suspicious?
Three, four hours.
Brian, we have a note coming in on the flight, possibly from the Tooth Fairy, number one priority.
It has to go to Hair and Fiber,
Latent Prints, and then Documents.
Will Graham and I will be walking it through.
One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.
And a couple of blue grains.
Work the hair.
What do we have for negative comparison?
Hair from Lecktor's comb, whiskers from Lecktor's razor they let him use.
This is hair from the security guard.
How many guys handled this without gloves?
The guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
The cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had the oil washed off his fingers.
But the others...
One smudge.
Those aren't ridges.
It's just the texture of the paper.
I can fume for a print, but can't guarantee the iodine stains would fade out.
Ninhydrin?
Boost it with heat?
No.
We couldn't wash it after.
I can't get a print off this in the time you've got to get it back, Will.
How long do I have?
Twenty minutes, max.
The main thing to find out is, how was Lecktor supposed to reply to him?
Which is probably the missing section, because at the top it says,
"l hope we can correspond," then comes the gap.
This note was written in ballpoint, but it looks like Lecktor went over this area with a felt-tip pen, then tore it away.
You're so sly, but so am I.
The aniline dyes used in the ink of the felt-tip pens like Lecktor used are transparent to infrared.
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.
This looks like the tip of a T here, here, and here.
At the end is what could be the top of an R.
There's three Ts and an R in "Tattler."
We know our boy reads it.
The article about me and Lecktor.
I don't know anybody else that's carried that.
Personal ads.
We believe the Tooth Fairy told Lecktor to reply to him through the personal ad section of the National Tattler.
The Chicago office is down there right now running through their ads.
We have cut into a line of communication between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor.
If we find Lecktor's reply we plan to pull it, substitute it with one of our own.
And this is what the Tooth Fairy will read.
Bill?
"Dear Avid Fan, inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements.
"Mementoes for you at Baltimore Central Left Luggage.
"Ticket number 72683."
It's a Secret Service letter drop.
We plan to stake it out.
When he shows, we'll grab him.
Anything from Chicago?
Not yet.
When do they go to press?
Thirty-five minutes.
Christ.
Let's get to the physical.
There was no print.
Scale counts and core size of the hair match the blond hair found in the Jacobis'.
That note was written by your man.
Aside from the hair, three blue grains, dark flecks, went to Brian's end.
The grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine, from the cleaning man.
Several particles of dried blood, but not enough to type.
This is Chester.
Who am I talking to?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford.
Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in it being telexed to you right now.
Read it.
"Dear Avid Fan,
"You honor me.
You're very beautiful."
Oh, Christ.
"l offer 100 prayers for your safety.
"Find help in GaIatians 6:11, 15:2,
"Acts 3:3, Revelations 18:7,
"Jonah 6:8, John 6:22,
"Luke 1:7."
Thanks.
Jimmy.
Did you get anywhere at all identifying him off the Leeds' prints?
Not yet.
Photography at Langley?
They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.
No.
And our ad has to go out in the same book code Lecktor used, or he'll know it wasn't Lecktor talking to him.
Book code?
"100 prayers" could be the page number, the paired numbers could be line and letter.
But what book?
Not the Bible?
No.
Galatians 15:2.
Galatians only has six chapters.
The same with Jonah 6:8.
Jonah only has four chapters.
Lecktor was not using the Bible.
Then the Tooth Fairy probably named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
Right.
What about sweating Lecktor?
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.
He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
Wonderful.
The Tooth Fairy would have named a book he knew Lecktor has access to.
He'd know it from articles he'd read about Lecktor.
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they can get everything back in place.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books.
Where?
Library of Congress.
Twenty-five minutes.
He won't make it in time.
Lecktor's ad runs as is, we decode it later.
Or we pull it, figure out the code and run our own ad next week.
And lose a week?
We got 17 days till the next full moon.
And I don't like Lecktor's ad running without knowing what it says.
It's your call, Will.
Run it.
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something else beside write?
We'll all feel sick for a very long time.
And if Bowman still can't figure it out?
Then we'll bait him with something else in next week's Tattler.
What, for instance?
Me.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
Why not?
Don't you think we can provoke him?
Maybe.
Maybe he can be provoked.
What I was thinking about is you.
You're getting deeper and deeper into this.
Good night.
Sidney.
I'll talk to you.
Last time you did that you did a real good job of pushing yourself all out of shape.
You try it on again or you go through some big trauma, you could relapse, my friend.
Sidney, don't worry about me.
I'm working the evidence, making moves.
That's all.
I'm fine.
Bowman just struck out.
It is not books in Lecktor's cell.
Price?
He just heard.
It's a bust-out.
As evidence, the Leeds print will get us a conviction if we could ever find the guy.
But he must never have been printed because he is not in our index.
We are not gonna identify him off the print.
I'll use Lounds.
What for?
Our boy doesn't read the New York Times literary supplement.
He reads Lounds in the Tattler.
What else should we cover?
He put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.
I believe he did this to make sure we wouldn't think he was gay.
He's molested all of his male victims.
He may be impotent with members of the opposite sex.
Our forensic psychologists have projected, though I'm not sure, that he may have had sexual relations with his mother.
So, how long do you plan to stay in Washington?
Till we've taken out the Tooth Fairy.
Can the Tattler rely on getting the straight stuff from you?
Absolutely.
How does working on this case affect your sex life?
Mine?
It doesn't affect mine, it affects yours.
Go fuck yourself.
Look, pal of mine, you're news.
Shoot the pictures.
All right, Symie, let's shoot them.
I'm in the shots with Graham.
What?
I'm in the shots with you.
Come on, you want this to look real or not?
Make sure the theater sign across the street is just slightly out of focus.
We want him to be able to read it so he can find it, but we don't want to look too obvious.
You make sure that I look excellent.
All right, shoot it.
One more.
One more.
That's enough.
Okay, Graham.
Hey, always nice, huh?
Let's have lunch, call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.
Dr. Bloom. I need them on my desk in two hours.
Did Bowman break the code yet?
No.
Tools and Firearms say the cutting tool used on the severed branch was a common bolt cutter.
I got a call from Asian Studies at Langley.
The mark you found on the tree?
Yeah?
It's a Chinese character considered a lucky sign in gambling.
That same character appears on a Mah Jongg piece.
It means "Red Dragon." Mean anything to you?
No.
If he shows, and he's smart, he'll approach you from the front, pass, turn, try and take you from behind.
How's your hearing?
It's good.
You'll wear a wire, one-way.
We'll hear you, you won't hear us.
You checked out a Charter Arms .44 Special Bulldog?
Yeah.
Load these in it.
You ever fire them?
Glaser Safety Slugs.
Yeah.
Number 12 shots.
Suspended in liquid Teflon in a copper casing.
On impact it all opens up in the target.
Guaranteed one-shot stop.
You got body armor?
Yeah, Kevlar Second Chance.
I hope you get one.
'Cause he's gone for the head shot eight of eleven times?
Let's walk the route.
United Flight 849 to Newark now boarding at Gate 7...
United Flight 849 to Newark now boarding at Gate 7.
Someone's coming.
Go!
Don't!
Don't move!
Take the money!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Clear!
What you moving in slow motion for, man?
I'm being mugged!
For real.
Can you believe that?
Pay up.
...in sports, the Cubs lost again.
Hey!
You know who I am?
I don't want to know who you are.
According to you, I'm a sexual pervert.
"An animal," you said.
You know who I am now?
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Open your eyes.
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.
Your job is to report.
That's why you're here.
And if you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Well, here I am.
Look at the screen.
William Blake's The Great Red Dragon and the Woman clothed In The Rays Of The Sun.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Leeds.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi.
Do you see?
Yes.
The next family as they will look when I go to visit them.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Leeds, later.
Her husband beside her.
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.
The Dragon rampant.
Freddie Lounds, your photograph.
No.
No what?
Not me, please.
Please.
Are you a man?
Yes.
Do you imply that I'm queer?
God, no.
Before me, you are a slug in the sun.
You are privy to a great becoming, and you recognize nothing.
You are an ant in the afterbirth.
It is your nature to do one thing correctly, tremble.
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, Lounds, you and the others, you owe me awe.
We have one more piece of work to do.
If he takes off the mask, I am a dead man.
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!
You will read this into the tape recorder.
Go.
"l have had a great privilege.
"l have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the Red Dragon.
"All I wrote about him were lies.
"Will Graham made me write them
"to pull him into a trap in Washington, District of Columbia.
"Will Graham, you will learn from my own lips
"how much you have to dread because I was forced to lie.
"He will be more merciful to me than to you.
"You will lie awake in fear of what the Red Dragon will do.
"l will be a testament to the truth of this."
You did very well.
Will you let me go now?
Please?
You will tell the truth?
I promise.
Good.
We'll seal your promise with...
We'll seal your promise
with a kiss.
We'II be showing five possible answers to the questions I'll be asking.
Any member of a team may buzz in an answer, but if incorrect, then the other team will have the opportunity...
Bowman, just skip the cryptography and tell me what the hell it says, okay?
Did he try to say anything at all?
No, he sure didn't.
He never regained consciousness.
Did you hear the tape?
Yeah.
Listen, Bowman just broke the code that Lecktor used in the Tattler personal ad.
It was the State of Maryland statutes.
You need to know what it said right now.
What?
Listen to me.
Everything is okay.
I've taken care of it.
What is it, Jack?
The bastard gave him your home address.
It said, "Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway,
"Captiva, Florida.
"Save yourself.
Kill them all."
Get me a plane.
Will!
Mom.
Huh?
What time...
What?
Someone's outside.
There are noises.
Where?
Outside.
Mom...
Go back to your room and close the door.
Mom...
Do it now.
Ma'am, are you all right?
What?
What is it?
What is it?
What's going on?
Ma'am, I think you should come back inside.
What's going on?
Come back inside.
Please. I think you should come back inside.
I'm sorry, Molly.
I'm sorry about all of this.
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.
He's after you now, isn't he?
This is just a precaution.
Kevin, why don't you run down to the water, check out the dock?
I want to hang around here.
I'm in the kitchen, Mom.
Okay.
What is that about?
What, he's afraid to leave you alone with me now?
He saw the article in the Tattler, right?
I wanted to talk with him about it, but he said he wanted to bring it up to you, face to face.
Good for him.
Kevin, help me unpack, will you?
Then we'll go get some groceries.
You and Mom are very well-protected, you know.
No one's gonna find out where you are.
is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
No.
This guy is trying to kill us?
We don't know that.
When are you going to kill him?
I'm not.
It's only my job to find him.
Barry's mom had this newspaper.
It said you were in a special hospital.
Well, it was a regular hospital, then I was transferred into the psychiatric wing.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
I don't know.
Was it because in the papers it said it was this man Lecktor?
Mmm-hmm.
What happened?
Well, Lecktor was attacking college girls, then he killed them.
How?
In bad ways.
He was a psychiatrist.
One of the girls was his patient, and I went to talk to him about her.
I tried to build feelings in my imagination like the killer had so that I would know why he did what he did, because that would help me find him.
When I was sitting in Lecktor's office and I looked up, I saw a book on his shelf.
It had pictures of war wounds in it.
And I knew it was him.
So I went to a pay phone down the hall to call the police and that's when he attacked me.
You and Mom came to see me in the hospital, and that helped a lot.
But after my body got okay, I still had his thoughts going around in my head.
And I stopped talking to people.
And a doctor friend of mine, a Dr. Bloom, asked me to get some help.
And I did.
Then after a while I felt better, and I was okay again.
And the way he thought felt that bad?
Kevin, they're the ugliest thoughts in the world.
So, what kind of coffee do you like?
You like that Folgers stuff, right?
Yeah.
Mom likes that, too.
When can we go home, Dad?
I don't know, Kevin.
So, where are things?
Nowhere.
Everything we've tried is either a dead end or it's backfired.
Crawford's already planning the next crime scene so they can get it fresh.
We've got about six more days till the next full moon.
Can you quit?
No.
What's next?
I go to Atlanta.
Crawford?
No.
I have to be alone.
You're talking about doing exactly what you said you...
This killing, it's gotta stop.
William, you're gonna make yourself sick.
Or get yourself killed.
You and Kevin should go to Montana.
See your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.
And I'll come up and get you afterwards.
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry I can't come to the phone right now.
I'm sorry, too.
Excuse me.
Coffee.
It's just you and me now, sport.
I'm gonna find you, God damn it.
Mr. Dollarhyde?
Eileen.
Bill told me to tell you there was a variation in the gamma of number three.
But he caught it in time.
Eileen, good.
Good.
Who's there?
Mr. Dollarhyde.
I came about the low-light infrared emulsion.
Oh, yeah.
Come on in, it's safe.
Put your back against the door.
There's a stool just to your right.
You're the production controller from Admin, right?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions?
Shooting from maybe eight feet.
I can't use any lights.
Okay, what's being photographed?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
Four days.
Okay, let me stick this in the black hole.
1000-C infrared sensitive has to be handled in total darkness.
Remember to be very careful with it.
But still, it's easier to handle than the 1200 series.
It'll be fine.
In case you're wondering, I keep the samples straight by touch code.
No, I wasn't wondering.
Reba, I gotta fly.
Maybe Mr. Dollarhyde can drive you home tonight.
No, that's okay.
I'll take care of myself.
I can change things around.
No, thanks, go on.
Okay.
I'll take you.
No, thanks.
I'll order you 1200 feet of 1000-C in the morning.
Ride with me.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus.
I do it all the time.
Ride with me.
It would be because I would like you to.
Okay, sure.
Let me get my stuff on.
How did you come to Gateway?
Oh, they had to hire the handicapped to shape up their employment practices to get this defense contract.
You worked out well.
Everybody they hired did.
You know, you speak very well.
Although you avoid fricatives and sibilants.
At the Riker Institute for the Blind, I trained in therapy for speech- and hearing-impaired children.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Mmm-hmm.
You know, if you don't want to talk, that's okay.
But I hope you will, because you're very direct, and I like that, and I like what you have to say.
May I touch your face?
I want to know whether you're smiling or frowning.
I guess I want to know whether I should be quiet or not.
Take my word for it.
I'm smiling.
I didn't mean to offend you.
On the way, can I take you somewhere?
Where?
It would be my surprise.
Okay, sure.
Are you apprehensive?
No.
The very protective Mr. Dollarhyde over there is watching us.
No, no, I want to.
In about two hours we're going to cap his tooth.
Yeah.
It's warm.
Back a little bit.
There.
You hear it?
Yeah.
You rearrange the dead families into an audience to see what you do.
You think that what you do will make you into something different.
You are becoming.
What is it you think you're becoming?
The answer is in the way you use the mirrors.
What do the mirrors make you dream you're becoming?
A little to your left.
Francis, that was a great dinner.
Thank you.
I made you a gin and tonic.
It's right in front of you.
What are you watching?
It's just a little homework.
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, D.
Your heart's loud.
If you'll hold me... ls that you, D?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Hi.
Good morning.
Morning.
You know, if you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee.
No, no...
Don't go back inside the house.
Why?
I left my purse inside.
I'll get it. lt's okay.
I mean, you should stay outside, it's...
It's... lt's 'cause you look so good in the sun.
Okay.
When...
Reba, when can I see you again?
Oh!
Um...
We could meet at my house.
You got the message Lecktor called?
Yeah. I arranged for him to have a phone.
I gotta call him in a few minutes.
Good.
Listen, we identified the tire tracks left when Lounds was delivered back to the Tattler.
G-7816 Goodyear truck tires.
Looks like our boy drives a van.
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you coming back?
When I'm done, Jack.
Yeah, this is Will Graham of the fbi.
Dr. Chilton arranged for me to talk to Dr. Lecktor.
Hello?
Hello, Will.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds.
I admire that enormously.
Oh, what a cunning boy you are.
I'm sick of you crazy sons of bitches.
You got something to say, say it.
I want to help you.
You'd be more comfortable if you relax with yourself.
We don't invent our natures, they're issued to us, along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else.
Why fight it?
Fight what?
Did you really feel so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death?
I didn't know you then, but I think you probably did.
But it wasn't the act that got you down, was it?
Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?
And why shouldn't it feel good?
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.
God's terrific.
He dropped a church roof on 34 of his worshippers last Wednesday night in Texas as they were groveling through a hymn to his majesty.
Don't you think that felt good?
Why does it feel good, Dr. Lecktor?
It feels good, Will, because God has power.
And if one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.
He got 140 Filipinos in one plane crash last month.
Remember that earthquake in Italy last spring?
I enter.
The glass cutter.
The piece of glass I take out is mine.
The house is mine.
I walk up these stairs, I pass the children's toys.
The children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.
I move to the door.
I step into the room.
I see you there.
And I see me desired by you.
Accepted and loved in the silver mirrors of your eyes.
I'm gonna talk to Fogel tomorrow...
Wait a minute.
What was it?
Pollen.
Oh.
Thanks for the ride.
See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
Mr. Dollarhyde.
What are you doing here?
Who is it?
It's me.
Who?
Who is it?
It's me.
Oh.
Francis?
No, not Francis.
Francis is gone.
Francis is gone forever.
So, what are we doing?
The dream.
He dreams about being wanted and desired, so he changes people into beings who want and desire him.
Changes?
It's a word.
Killing and arranging the people to imitate it.
And Lecktor told me something.
If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
You put it together, you get, if our boy imitates being wanted and desired enough times, he believes he will become one who is wanted and desired and accepted.
It'll all come true.
This started from an abused kid, a battered infant.
There's something terrible about...
What, are you sympathizing with this guy now?
Absolutely.
My heart bleeds for him as a child.
Someone took a kid and manufactured a monster.
At the same time, as an adult, he's irredeemable.
He butchers whole families to pursue trivial fantasies.
As an adult, someone should blow this sick fuck out of his socks.
Do you think that's a contradiction, Jack?
Does this kind of understanding make you uncomfortable?
What about the mirrors?
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.
But he doesn't take anything.
There's no souvenirs taken from the houses.
He needs souvenirs or trophies to re-live the event.
Maybe he records it somehow.
So he could see himself accepted over and over and over again.
VTRs, Polaroids, stills, what?
How do I know?
How does he find them?
When we find out how he found them, we'll find him.
There is no connection between the two families.
We've done a dozen computer runs.
Jack, all the women have a bloom on them.
He didn't win them in a lottery, he picked these women.
There's selection and design in his choices.
Look, admit we struck out this month.
The Lear Jet is standing by, the basic lab stuff is on it.
You, Zeller, Jimmy Price, the photographer, anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and 15 minutes.
We get the call, we roll.
The scene will be fresher than we've ever had it.
It's not over yet.
For Christ's sake!
That's a foregone conclusion.
It's 11:30 p. m. , the full moon is happening tonight.
Give it up!
Forget this month, it's too damn late!
I gave it up.
Till you showed up with pictures of two dead families, knowing goddamn well that I'd imagine families three, four, five and six.
Right?
You're fucking right I did, and I'd do it again!
Great!
But don't talk to me about late, pal, I'll tell you when it's too fucking late!
Until then, we go as late as I want to take it!
A padlock.
That's why the bolt cutter.
What's that?
He used a bolt cutter to trim away the branch when he was watching from the woods.
Why didn't he use the bolt cutter on the garage door?
Because a deadbolt was there when they were killed.
Donald Jacobi's 12th birthday party was April 14th.
Sometime between April 14th and August 1 they changed the lock.
But he thought there was a padlock there.
From the street, you can't see the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door.
There's a big, high fence there.
But he was ready with his glass cutter.
So either he was casing far ahead and we didn't check back far enough,
or...
We checked.
Don't talk.
Metcalfe, is the Leeds and Jacobi stuff still in the storeroom?
Have the guard down there call me.
Do it.
You know that's the Jacobis' cat.
You brought a bolt cutter 'cause you thought there was a padlock.
The Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog, don't you, my man?
See the woman?
The bloom on the woman?
You can see her again and again anytime you want.
Doggie doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog.
And the Jacobi cat.
And the padlock on the door.
And you know you need a bolt cutter and every other goddamn thing because everything with you is seeing, isn't it?
Your primary sensory intake that makes your dream live is seeing.
Reflections, mirrors, images...
You've seen these films.
Haven't you, my man?
It's the guard in the storeroom.
The cans.
What cans?
The tapes were transferred from home movies.
Where's the packaging the films came in?
There's films of the families in the document storage.
Find them.
You got them?
Are there any labels?
Leeds can, Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
The Jacobi label will say the same thing as the Leeds label.
Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
Who processed the Jacobi film?
No.
Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.
Stores send them out.
Have him peel the top label back.
is there a label underneath?
It does, doesn't it?
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes to Meigs Field.
At Meigs Field, I want the Lear Jet prepped and a plan filed with St. Louis.
Where are you?
Are you here?
You're scaring me with this!
Will you just stop it?
Francis, why are you doing this to me?
It's ugly!
Are you in this room?
Where are you?
You answer me!
We're looking for a man.
We know he works at Gateway.
We don't have his name, but we know he drives a van.
Under "Employee Facilities,"
I've got special stickers for vans.
Yeah, I got 28, 29 van permits in the computer.
Start feeding me names.
is this Lieutenant Fisk?
Will Graham.
Listen, I need you to punch up the driver's licenses of the names I'm gonna feed you.
The man we're looking for is blond, Caucasian, twenty to forty years old, over six feet tall, 180 to 225 pounds.
First name?
Alvaro.
A-L-V-A-R-O.
First name Joseph.
Alvaro.
A-L-V-A-R-O.
First name Joseph.
No.
Black hair.
No.
Next.
Dillon.
D-l-L-L-O-N.
First name Lincoln.
No.
Next.
Male.
Caucasian.
Six foot-seven, 217 pounds.
Eyes brown, hair blond.
Thirty-four years old.
Put it through the data-fax.
Fast.
You guys better buckle up.
We're on approach to Lambert field.
Fogel has four more names.
He knows two, both dark hair, third's a woman, fourth is a handicapped parking permit.
This is our man.
Rural Route 3, Chester, Missouri.
Where is that?
From the airport you're a few minutes closer.
We'll 10-25 at the Hark Road off ramp, Highway 94.
Let's go!
Meet point's up ahead.
Go on to the house.
But Lieutenant Fisk said...
Go on to the house.
Will?
You're not gonna need that.
A SWAT team is gonna take him down, not us.
Will?
Will!
This ought to be it right here.
Kill your lights.
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
Griffin's hurt bad.
I'll wait for the backup.
Set up a roadblock on Route 3.
Graham and I are in the trees west of the house.
How far away is the backup unit?
I'm going around the back.
Stay in the trees.
He's in there, Jack.
And he's got somebody in there with him.
What?
Will, what did you say?
will.
Wait for the backup, Will.
He's got somebody in the house with him, Jack.
will.
Stop it.
Stop it!
It's okay.
Who are you?
Graham.
I'm Will Graham.
Hey, Dad!
Dad!
Hey!
It looks worse than it is, pal.
See the turtles?
Hi.
It was on the news.
I thought I had to work things out and call you after.
I thought I wouldn't wait.
How many of them made it?
Most of them.
Most of them made it.
We should've talked at the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk about it here.
I'm not fallin' all over myself to talk about it much anywhere, Jack.
- How much do you know?
- Not much.
The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago.
The second one in Atlanta was all over TV.
- You ever think about givin' me a call?
- No.
- Why not?
- I quit, remember?
You look all right now.
I am.
All right.
If you can't look any more, I understand.
Don't try to run a game down on me, Jack.
If I really didn't need you to come back, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks and a few days until the next full moon.
We have a better chance to get him fast if you help.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
Hi, Molly.
- Think it'll keep 'em out, Dad?
- Yep.
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
In this hatchery?
Just 40 or 50 of 'em.
- Crabs get most of the newborns, huh?
- Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it.
Guaranteed.
What about the dogs?
Are they gonna get in?
No - they can't dig under, you see.
That's why we bury the wire down in the sand.
I need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be his friend, Jack.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, Molly, I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.
- We got it pretty good, don't we?
- We have it more than good.
All that happened to you before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only look at evidence.
I wouldn't get deeply involved.
He'd never even see me or know my name.
If they find him, they'll have to take him down, not me.
What do you think?
I think you've already decided and you're not really asking.
If I were asking...
Stay here with me.
Me and Kevin.
But that's selfish, and I know it.
Come here.
I'll come inside with you if you want, to show you around.
Mr Crawford said you may wanna be alone...
That's right.
There's a VCR hooked up in your hotel room.
They transferred some home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen sliding door.
Used a glass cutter anchored to a suction cup.
His entry was skilful.
All the prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair.
Strong.
Size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood AB positive, typed from saliva on glass from licking the suction cup.
Why didn't he care that he left saliva on the glass?
It was hot out that night.
So inside the house must have felt cool to him.
The intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he was rising, then shot Mrs Leeds.
The bullet lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation.
Elevation of serotonin and increase of free histamine level in gunshot wound indicates she lived at least five minutes after she was shot.
All her other injuries were postmortem.
The direction and velocity of bloodstains on east wall indicate arterial spray.
Even with his throat cut, Leeds fought, because the intruder was moving to the children's room.
Bloodstains on west wall of master bedroom and sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained,
as does superficial ligature mark around Mr Leeds' chest, also believed to be postmortem.
What'd the killer do with them after they were dead?
(phone rings)
Hi.
This is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry I can't come to the phone right now, but if you'd like to leave a message, please do so and I'll call you back as soon as I can.
(beep)
(caller hangs up)
29th floor.
Going up.
(no sound on tape)
When they were dead, he smashed the mirrors and began selecting pieces that he would use later on Mrs Leeds.
(sighs)
Killing Mr Leeds and the children would take less than a minute.
Mrs Leeds' injuries were postmortem.
Four or five minutes later.
What did he do in the interval?
Smeared bloodstains on the west wall.
Uh...
(phone rings)
- Hello?
- Molly?
- Will, is that you?
- Yeah, it's me, honey.
Look, uh...
I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.
(dialling tone)
What are you dreaming?
That's somethin' you can't afford for me to know about, isn't it?
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
It was maddening to have to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg.
But there wasn't any talcum powder in the bathroom.
The talcum powder came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you?
You son of a bitch, you touched her with your bare hands!
And then you put your gloves back on.
But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so that they could see you?
- Crawford.
- Jack.
This is Graham.
Is Price still in Latent Prints?
Yeah.
He's in charge of the single print index now.
- What do you got, Will?
- Get him to Atlanta.
Atlanta PD say they dusted everything.
Their guy's good.
- He is, but not as good as Price.
- I'll get him on a plane tomorrow.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs Leeds' finger- and toenails, and the corneas of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves, Jack.
Our people swear he wore surgeon's gloves the whole time.
They dusted everything.
Your report didn't mention eyes.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
Because Mrs Leeds was a beautiful woman.
This is what the subject's teeth look like.
The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed these from the impressions of the bite marks on the Leeds woman here and the Jacobi woman in Birmingham last month.
As you can see, he has pegged lateral incisors.
That's these teeth here and here.
Vice and Narcotics, you take the KY cowboys and the leather bars.
Marcus, Whitman, the funeral.
The rest of you, assignments are on the sheet.
Uh, one more thing.
I've heard officers referring' to this killer as the "Tooth Fairy".
- (laughter)
- I don't wanna hear that in public.
And I don't wanna see it in internal memoranda.
That's it.
I know a burglar's gonna fence what he stole, cos his motive is cash money.
I know his motive, so I go to work on fences.
This guy, we don't even have motive.
None of us have shit, and we know it.
It's in his dreams.
- His motive?
- Yeah.
His act fuels his fantasy.
- Which is?
- I don't know.
The commissioner was saying that you're the one who got Garrett Jacob Hobbes, and then Dr Lecktor three years ago.
- Lecktor killed nine people, didn't he?
- Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
- What happened to them?
- One's on a respirator, in Baltimore, one's in a Denver mental hospital.
What'd the psychologist say was wrong with Lecktor?
The psychologists call him a psychopath.
They don't know what else to call him.
I understand he cut you pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's.
The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen.
- The Jacobis in Birmingham had a cat?
- That's right.
We found the litter box downstairs but we didn't find the cat.
Why not get Birmingham PD a methane probe out of Washington?
Have 'em cover the back yard.
Maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
(phone rings)
- Yeah?
- This is Jimmy Price, FBI.
- Let me put you on speakerphone.
- Who am I talking to?
Jack Crawford.
Will Graham's here too.
I got a partial print with a tented arch.
It's probably a thumb.
And the fragment of a palm off the nail of Mrs Leeds' left big toe.
The thumbprint came off the oldest kid's left eye.
It stood out on a haemorrhage from the gunshot wound.
- Can we make an identification off of it?
- Maybe.
If he's ever been printed and he's in my index.
I wanna work these up in my darkroom.
I'll fax the prints to you this afternoon.
Thanks, Jimmy.
(shouting, cameras clicking)
(reporters asking questions)
No comment.
We get lucky with that print, we're in.
If Jimmy can find him in the index,
- and if he's ever been printed.
- Will Graham!
Remember me?
Freddie Lounds.
Covered the Lecktor case for the Tattler, did the paperback.
So, Will, when did they call you in?
I'm buyin' lunch.
- Lounds, give it a rest.
- Hey, he's news.
I'm doin' my job.
How does he compare with Lecktor?
What does he do to 'em?
How's he do 'em?
How's he do 'em, Will?
- Keep the fuck away from me.
- Will.
Will!
(train horn blares)
He snuck in while I was sedated after Lecktor.
He pulled back the sheets and took pictures.
- Yeah, I know.
- Look, don't expect too much from me.
We only got three weeks.
You're our best shot.
You think I'll see him in the street and say "There he is"?
That's Houdini you're thinkin' about.
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on until we get smart or we get lucky.
He won't stop.
- Why?
- He's got a genuine taste for it.
You do know somethin' about him.
Not enough.
I think I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mind-set.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Yeah, I keep getting it for Christmas.
- Did you get my card?
- I got it.
Thank you.
And how is Officer Stuart?
The one who was first to see my basement.
- Stuart's fine.
- Emotional problems, I hear.
- Do you have any problems, Will?
- No.
No.
Of course you don't.
I'm glad you came.
My callers are mostly clinical psychologists from cornfed universities somewhere.
Second-raters, the lot.
Dr Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction.
- And?
- Very interesting.
Even to a layman.
I want you to help me, Dr Lecktor.
Yes.
I thought so.
- It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
- Yes?
- You read about it?
- In the papers.
I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
- I thought you'd have ideas.
- Why should I tell you?
You'd get to see the file on this case.
- And there's another reason.
- Pray tell.
I thought you'd want to see if you're smarter than him.
You think you're smarter than me, since you caught me.
No.
I know that I'm not smarter than you.
- How did you catch me?
- You had disadvantages.
- What disadvantages?
- You're insane.
You're very tan, Will.
Your hands are rough.
They don't look like cop's hands any more.
That shaving lotion's what a child would select.
It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it?
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
I don't think I'll persuade you at all.
You'll either do it or you won't.
Besides, we have Dr Bloom working on it.
He's the best.
- Do you have the file with you?
Pictures?
- Yes.
- Let me have them and I may consider it.
- No.
- Dream much, Will?
- Goodbye, Dr Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file, and I'll tell you what I think.
(knocks on door)
This is a very shy boy, Will.
- What were the yards like?
- Big back yards.
Fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, my dear Will, if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he might go outside to look at it.
Have you ever seen blood in the moonlight, Will?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy for this sort of thing.
- That's interesting.
- No, it's not.
You thought of it before.
- I considered it.
- You came here to look at me.
- To get the old scent back again.
- I want your opinion.
- I don't have one right now.
- When you have one, I'd like to hear it.
- Can I keep this?
- I haven't decided yet.
I'll study them.
When you get more files, I'd like to see them too.
You can call me.
When I call my lawyer they bring a phone.
Would you like to leave me your home phone number?
- No.
- Do you know how you caught me, Will?
- Call the number on the file.
- Do you know how you caught me?
(knocks hard)
The reason you caught me, Will, is we're just alike.
You want the scent?
Smell yourself.
(camera motor drive)
Gotcha.
(airport announcement)
Get up by the bunk.
Face the wall.
Don't turn around or I'll Mace you in the face.
Thank you so much.
I'll call you when I'm finished.
- Are you ready for your call?
- Yes.
Thank you.
(ringing tone)
Paltrow, Christiansen and Golub law offices.
Excuse me, I must have misdialled.
(dialling tone)
(ringing tone)
Thank you for using AT T. This is operator 24.
Operator.
Er...
I don't have the use of my arms.
Er, would you be so kind as to, er, dial a number for me, please?
- Certainly.
What's the number?
- Area code 301-555-6624.
(dialling tones)
(ringing tone)
University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry.
- Dr Sidney Bloom, please.
- He's not in.
I'll connect you to his office.
- What's his secretary's name again?
- Martha King.
Just a moment, please.
- Martha King's desk.
- Hi.
Martha.
- Martha doesn't come in nights.
- Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob Greer of Blain and Edwards Publishing.
Dr Bloom asked me to send a copy of The Psychiatrist and the Law to someone.
- Martha never sent me the address.
- She'll be in in the morning.
Well, I've gotta catch Federal Express in about five minutes.
I'd be appreciative if you could pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
- I don't see a Rolodex.
- I bet she has a Call Caddy by her phone.
Yeah.
Zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
All right.
The name we're looking for...
Last name Graham.
The man the book is supposed to be sent to.
A Mr Will Graham.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, 10th and Pennsylvania, Washington, DC.
Now, I'll bet it has his home address there too.
3680 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida.
Thank you... so very much.
I've finished.
- Mommy!
- Oh, my gosh.
It's all right.
Stewardess!
(captain) Ladies and gentlemen, we are beginning' our descent into Birmingham.
You used a cutting tool on the branch so that you could see.
And you passed the time whittling.
And dreaming.
When night came, you saw them pass by their bright windows, you watched the shades go down,
and you saw the lights go out one by one.
And after a while you climbed down and you went in to 'em, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You watched them all goddamn day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
I need Firearms and Toolmarks here on a branch.
I need to know what tool he used.
Then I need Bowman in Documents on this carving.
- Is it weird?
- The mark?
Yeah.
If Documents can't do it, I'll send it to Langley.
- Did Price identify the Leeds print?
- No.
He hasn't found him in the index.
It's a hand search.
He's got half his department on it.
Listen, Will, have you seen this week's Tattler?
- It's not on my preferred reading list.
- Yeah, well, uh...
Your picture's all over the front page.
- Who the hell was it?
Lounds?
- Yes.
Who else?
Goddamn it, Jack!
I promised Molly!
I promised her!
- Come in.
- Dr Chilton?
- Yes.
- We were cleaning out Dr Lecktor's cell.
He heard us coming and hid something in a book.
We got him out and dug around.
- Is that it?
- Yes.
Put it down on my desk.
- Has anyone else seen this except you?
- No.
- Special Agent Crawford's office.
- This is Dr Chilton.
- I need to speak to Mr Graham.
- He's in Birmingham.
Agent Crawford is on the line with him.
Will you please tell them this is very, very urgent?
I'll hold on.
Dr Chilton, it's Crawford.
Will Graham's on the line too.
I have a note, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from that man
- who killed those people in Atlanta.
- Where did you get it?
In Hannibal Lecktor's cell, hidden in a book.
Don't touch the note.
Can you read it to us?
It's written on toilet tissue. "My dear Dr Lecktor,
I wanted to tell you I am delighted that you've taken an interest in me."
"I know that you alone can understand what I am Becoming. "
"You alone know the people I use to help me in these things are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am Becoming, just as the source of light is burning."
"I have a collection of your press clippings."
"I think they are absurd, as are mine."
"The 'Tooth Fairy'.
What could be more inappropriate?"
"Investigator Graham interests me.
Very purposeful looking."
"I hope we can correspond."
Mr Graham, there's a piece missing here.
Now I'll read the bottom part.
"After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet."
Signed "Avid Fan".
It has teeth marks pressed into it at the bottom.
Sarah, order a chopper.
I don't care whose it is.
Call Alabama Air National Guard and tell 'em to get Graham back here now.
Tell Documents to scramble a team.
I want everybody moving' five minutes ago.
I have a Documents team on its way by helicopter to pick up the note.
After we work the note, replace it in Lecktor's cell.
I don't want Lecktor to know we found it.
He might try to warn the killer.
- Where's Lecktor now?
- (Chilton) Holding cell.
- How long can you keep him there?
- Three, four hours.
Brian, we have a note coming in, possibly from the Tooth Fairy, number one priority.
It must go to Hair and Fibre, Latent Prints and Documents.
Graham and I'll take it.
One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.
- A couple of blue grains.
- Work the hair.
- What we got for negative comparison?
- Hair from Lecktor's comb.
Whiskers from the electric razor they let him use.
Hair from the security guard.
- How many handled this without gloves?
- Guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
Cleanup man, scrubbing sinks.
Probably had the oil washed off his fingers.
But the others...
One smudge.
Those aren't ridges.
It's just the texture of the paper.
I can fume for a print, but can't say the iodine stains'd fade out.
- Ninhydrin?
Boost it with heat?
- No, we couldn't wash it after.
I can't get a print off this in the time you've got to get it back.
- How long do I have?
- 20 minutes, max.
The main thing to find out is, how is Lecktor supposed to reply to him?
Which is probably the missing section.
It says "I hope we can correspond."
Then comes the gap.
This note was written in ballpoint.
It looks like Lecktor went over this area with a felt-tip pen, then tore it away.
You're so sly, but so am I.
The aniline dyes used in the ink of felt-tip pens like Lecktor used are transparent to infrared.
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.
Looks like the tip of a T here, here, and here.
- At the end could be the top of an R.
- There's three Ts and an R in "Tattler".
Our boy reads it.
The article about me and Lecktor.
I don't know anybody else that carried that.
Personal ads.
We believe the Tooth Fairy told Lecktor to reply to him through the personal ads section of the National Tattler.
The Chicago office is down there running through their ads.
We have cut into a line of communication between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor.
If we find Lecktor's reply, we plan to pull it, substitute it with one of our own.
This is what the Tooth Fairy will read.
Bill?
"Dear Avid Fan.
Inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements."
"Mementoes for you at Baltimore Central, left luggage."
"Ticket number 72683."
It's a Secret Service letter drop.
We'll stake it out.
When he shows, we grab him.
- Anything from Chicago?
- Not yet.
- When do they go to press?
- 35 minutes.
- Christ.
- Let's get to the physical.
- There was no print.
- Scale counts and core size of the hair matched the blond hair found in the Jacobis'.
That note was written by your man.
Aside from the hair, three blue grains, dark flecks - went to Brian's end.
The grains are commercial cleanser, with chlorine from the cleaner.
Particles of dried blood, but not enough to type.
(phone rings)
- This is Chester.
Who am I talking to?
- Will Graham, Jack Crawford.
I got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in it being telexed to you right now.
- Read it. - "Dear Avid Fan, you honour me."
- "You're very beautiful."
- Oh, Christ.
"I offer 100 prayers for your safety."
"Find help in Galatians 6:11, 15:2,
Acts 3:3, Revelations 18:7,
Jonah 6:8, John 6:22, Luke 1:7. "
(Crawford) Thanks.
Jimmy.
Did you get anywhere identifying him off the Leeds prints?
Not yet.
- Cryptography at Langley?
- They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.
No.
And our ad has to go out in the same book code Lecktor used,
- or he'll know it wasn't Lecktor.
- Book code?
"100 prayers" could be page, the paired numbers, line and letter.
But what book?
- The Bible?
- No.
Galatians 15:2...
Galatians only has six chapters.
Same with Jonah 6:8.
Jonah has four chapters.
Lecktor was not using The Bible.
He probably named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
Right.
What about sweating' Lecktor?
They tried sodium amytal to find where he buried a Princeton student.
- He gave 'em a recipe for potato-chip dip.
- Wonderful.
The Tooth Fairy would've named a book he knew Lecktor has access to.
- He'd know from articles.
- When Willingham tossed the cell, he took Polaroids so he could put it all back.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books.
- Where?
- Library of Congress.
25 minutes.
He won't make it in time.
Lecktor's ad runs as is, we decode it later.
Or we pull it, figure out the code
- and run our own ad next week.
- And lose a week?
We got 17 days...
And I don't like Lecktor's ad running without knowing what it says.
But it's your call, Will.
Run it.
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something else beside write?
We'll all feel sick for a very long time.
And if Bowman still can't figure it out?
We bait him with something in next week's Tattler.
What, for instance?
Me.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
Why not?
Don't you think we can provoke him?
Maybe.
Maybe he can be provoked.
What I was thinkin' about is you.
You're gettin' deeper and deeper into this.
Sidney.
Last time you did that you did a real good job of pushing yourself all out of shape.
You try it on again or you go through some big trauma, you could relapse.
Sidney, don't worry about me.
I'm workin' the evidence.
Makin' moves.
That's all.
I'm fine.
Bowman just struck out.
It is not books in Lecktor's cell.
- Price?
- He just heard it's a bust-out.
As evidence, the Leeds print will get us a conviction, if we could find the guy.
But he must never have been printed, because he is not in our index.
We are not going to identify him off the print.
- I'll use Lounds.
- What for?
Boy doesn't read The New York Times.
He reads Lounds in the Tattler.
- What else shall we cover?
- He put the shorts on Leeds after he died.
I believe he did this to make sure we wouldn't think he was gay.
He's molested all of his male victims.
He may be impotent with members of the opposite sex.
Our forensic psychologists have projected, though I'm not sure, that he may have had sexual relations with his mother.
- How long will you stay in Washington?
- Until we've taken out the Tooth Fairy.
- Can the Tattler get it straight from you?
- Absolutely.
How does working' on this case affect your sex life?
Mine?
It doesn't affect mine, it affects yours.
Go fuck yourself.
- Look, pal of mine, you're news.
- Pictures.
All right, let's shoot him.
I'm in the shots with Graham.
- What?
- I'm in the shots with you.
Come on!
You want this to look real or not?
Make sure the theatre sign across the street is just out of focus.
We want him to find it, but we don't wanna be obvious.
Make sure that I look excellent.
All right, shoot.
One more.
One more.
- That's enough.
- OK, Graham.
Hey, always nice, huh?
Let's have lunch.
Call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.
Dr Bloom.
I need them on my desk in two hours, OK?
- Did Bowman break the code yet?
- No.
Tools and Firearms say the cutting tool used on the branch was a common bolt-cutter.
I got a call from Asian Studies at Langley.
The mark you found on the tree?
- Yeah?
- It's a Chinese character, considered a lucky sign in gambling.
The same character appears on a mahjong piece.
It means "red dragon".
Mean anything to you?
No.
If he shows, and he's smart, he'll approach you from the front, pass, turn, try and take you from behind.
- How's your hearing?
- It's good.
You'll wear a wire, one way.
We'll hear you, you won't hear us.
- You checked out a.44 Special Bulldog?
- Yeah.
- Load these in it.
- Glaser safety slugs.
Yeah.
Number 12 shots suspended in liquid Teflon in a copper casing.
On impact, it all opens up in the target.
Guaranteed one-shot stop.
You got body armour?
- Yeah, Kevlar Second Chance.
- I hope you get one.
Cos he's gone for the head shot eight out of 11 times?
Let's walk the route.
United flight 849 to Newark is now boarding at gate seven.
United flight 849 to Newark is now boarding at gate seven.
Someone's comin'.
Go!
Don't!
Don't move.
- Take the money!
- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!
- Clear!
Clear!
What you movin' in slow motion for, man?
I'm bein' mugged!
- (laughter)
- Can you believe that?
(radio) WAB Chicago.
In sports, the Cubs lost again, and...
Hey!
Do you know who I am?
I don't wanna know who you are.
According to you, I'm a sexual pervert.
An animal, you said.
You know who I am now?
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Open your eyes.
Mr Lounds, you're a reporter.
Your job is to report.
That's why you're here.
If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Well?
Here I... am.
Look at the screen.
William Blake's The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in the Rays of the Sun.
- Do you see?
- Yes.
- Mrs Leeds.
Do you see?
- Yes.
- Mrs Jacobi.
Do you see?
- Yes.
The next family as they will look when I go to visit them.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs Leeds, later.
Her husband beside her.
Yes.
Mrs Jacobi, after her changing.
The Dragon rampant.
Freddie Lounds.
Your photograph.
No.
- No what?
- No.
Not me, please.
- Please.
- Are you a man?
Yes.
Do you imply that I am queer?
God, no!
Before me, you are a slug in the sun.
You are privy to a great...
Becoming, and you recognise nothing.
You are an ant in the afterbirth.
It is your nature to do one thing correctly.
Tremble.
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, Lounds.
You and the others, you owe me awe!
We have one more piece of work to do.
If he takes off the mask I am a dead man.
(sobs)
Open your eyes.
- Open your eyes!
- Aah!
You will read this into the tape recorder.
- Go. - "I have had a great privilege."
"I have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the Red Dragon."
"All I wrote about him were lies."
"Will Graham made me write them to pull him into a trap in Washington, District of Columbia."
"Will Graham, you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread because I was forced to lie."
"He will be more merciful to me than to you."
"You will lie awake in fear of what the Red Dragon will do."
"I will be a testament to the truth of this."
You did very well.
Will you let me go now?
Please?
You will tell the truth?
I promise.
Good.
We'll seal your promise with...
We'll seal your promise... with a kiss.
(screaming)
(man on radio)... five possible answers.
Any member of a team may buzz in, but if incorrect, the other team will have the opportunity to answer.
The team with the most points at the end will win... (squeaking)
(squeaking)
Hear that?
That means a round is over.
So, Jane, we're all ready for round one.
All right, Bob.
The first category today is the Far East.
And the choices are Vietnam, Japan, Laos, Thailand and China.
(Bob) Category and possible answers.
Every question's worth ten points, and I can only accept the answer of the person who buzzes in... (squeaking)
Bowman, just get to Cryptography and tell me what the hell it says, OK?
- Did he try to say anything at all?
- No, he sure didn't.
He never woke up.
Did you hear the tape?
Yeah.
Bowman broke the code that Lecktor used in the Tattler personal ad.
It was the State of Maryland Statutes.
You need to know what it said now.
- What?
- Listen to me.
Everything is OK.
I've taken care of it.
- What is it, Jack?
- The bastard gave him your address.
It said "Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida."
- "Save yourself, kill them all."
- Get me a plane.
Will!
Will.
Will.
Mom.
Huh?
What... what?
Someone's outside.
There are noises.
- Where?
- Outside.
Go back to your room and close the door.
Do it!
Now!
- Ma'am?
Are you all right?
- What?
What is it?
What is it?
What's going on?
- You should come back inside.
- What's going on?
- Come back inside.
- What's...
I think you should come back inside.
I'm sorry, Molly.
I'm sorry about all of this.
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.
- He's after you now, isn't he?
- It's just a precaution.
Kevin, why don't you run down to the water, check out the dock?
I wanna hang around here.
I'm in the kitchen, Mom.
OK.
What is that about?
What, he's afraid to leave you alone with me now?
- He saw the article in the Tattler, right?
- I wanted to talk with him, but he said he wanted to bring it up to you, face to face.
Good for him.
Kevin, come on.
Help me unpack, will you?
Then we'll go get some groceries.
You and Mom are very well protected.
No one's gonna find out where you are.
Is there anything I need to know?
To see about Mom?
- No.
- This guy's trying to kill us?
- We don't know that.
- When are you going to kill him?
I'm not.
It's only my job to find him.
Barry's mom had this newspaper.
It said you were in a special hospital.
Well, it was a regular hospital.
Then I was transferred into the psychiatric wing.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
I don't know.
Was it because... in the papers it said it was this man Lecktor?
- Mm-hm.
- What happened?
Well, Lecktor was attacking college girls, and he killed them.
How?
In bad ways.
He was a psychiatrist.
One of the girls was his patient, and I went to talk to him about her.
I tried to build feelings in my imagination like the killer had, so that I would know why he did what he did, because that would help me find him.
When I was sitting in Lecktor's office, and I looked up, I saw a book on his shelf.
It had pictures of war wounds in it.
Then I knew it was him.
So I went to a payphone down the hall to call the police.
And that's when he attacked me.
You and Mom came to see me in the hospital, and that helped a lot.
But after my body got OK, I still had his thoughts going around in my head.
And I stopped talking to people.
And a doctor friend of mine, a Dr Bloom, asked me to get some help.
And I did.
And after a while, I felt better, and I was OK again.
And the way he thought felt that bad?
Kevin, they're the ugliest thoughts in the world.
So what kind of coffee do you like?
- Huh?
- You like that Folgers stuff, right?
Yeah.
Mom likes that too.
When can we go home, Dad?
I don't know, Kevin.
- (Molly) So where are things?
- (Graham) Nowhere.
Everything we've tried is either a dead end or it's backfired.
Crawford's already planning the next crime scene so we can get it fresh.
We got about six more days till the next full moon.
Can you quit?
No.
What's next?
- I go to Atlanta.
- Crawford?
No.
I have to be... alone.
- It's exactly what you said you wouldn't...
- This killing.
It's got to stop.
William, you're gonna make yourself sick.
Or get yourself killed.
You and Kevin should go to Montana.
See your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.
And I'll come up and get you afterwards.
Hi.
This is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry I can't come to the phone right now.
- I'm sorry, too.
- Excuse me?
Coffee.
Just you and me now, sport.
I'm gonna find you, goddamn it.
- Mr Dollarhyde.
- Ah, Eileen.
Bill told me to tell you there was a variation in the gamma of number three.
- Oh.
- But he caught it in time.
Eileen...
Good.
Good.
- (knock) - (woman) Who's there?
Mr Dollarhyde.
I came about the low-light infrared emulsion.
Oh, yeah.
Come on in.
It's safe.
Put your back against the door.
There's a stool just to your right.
You're the production controller, right?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions?
I'm shooting from maybe eight feet.
- I...
I can't use any lights.
- OK.
What's being photographed?
- The activities of nocturnal animals.
- When do you need it?
- Four days.
- OK.
Let me stick these in a black bag.
1000C infrared sensitive has to be handled in total darkness.
Remember to be very careful with it, but it's easier to handle than the 1200 series.
It'll be fine.
In case you're wondering, I keep the samples straight by touch code.
I...
I wasn't wondering.
Reba, I gotta fly.
Maybe Mr Dollarhyde can drive you home?
No, that's OK.
I'll take care of myself.
No, thanks.
OK.
- I'll... take you.
- No, thanks.
I'll order you 1200 feet of 1000C in the morning.
- Ride with me.
- Thanks, but I'll take the bus.
Ride with me.
It would be because I would like you to.
OK.
Sure.
Let me get my stuff on.
How did you come to Gateway?
They had to hire the handicapped to shape up their employment practices to get this defence contract.
- But you worked out well.
- Yeah.
Everybody they hired did.
You know, you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants.
At the Institute for the Blind I trained in therapy for speech- and hearing-impaired children.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Uh-huh.
If you don't wanna talk, that's OK.
But I hope you will, because you're very direct, and I like that, and I like what you have to say.
May I touch your face?
I wanna know whether you're smiling or frowning.
I guess I wanna know whether I should be quiet or not.
Take my word for it.
I'm smiling.
I...
I didn't mean to offend you.
- On the way, can I take you somewhere?
- Where?
- It would be my surprise.
- OK, sure.
- Are you apprehensive?
- No.
You're very protected.
Mr Dollarhyde is watching us.
No, no.
I want to.
In about two hours, we're going to cap his tooth.
(Reba) Yeah.
(vet) It's warm?
Back a little bit.
There.
(heartbeat)
- You hear it?
- Yes.
You... rearrange the dead families into an audience to see what you do.
You think that what you do will make you into something different.
You are "Becoming".
What is it you think you're becoming?
The answer's in the way you use the mirrors.
What do the mirrors make you dream you're becoming?
A little to your left.
Francis, that was a great dinner.
Thank you.
Uh...
I made you a gin and tonic.
It's right in front of you.
What are you watching?
Just a little homework.
(# "This Big Hush" by Shriekback)
Sweet, thoughtful man, D.
# Is there a fire in the sky?
That's allowed...
# Is there a moon up there?
...if you hold me.
# Is anything alive now?
# This darkness is what I hear
# This is a breathless silence
# A moment out of time
# I see your face in the shadows, the telltale signs are in your eyes
# Aching with a passion inside
# Deep as the river
# All desire
# The ashes and the fire
# Turning this night inside
# And the light from you
# Is there a flame in the dark?
# Is there a bright hot star?
# These creatures look the same now
# We freeze wherever we are
# We wake alone in the blackness
# We sleep wherever we fall

# This big hush infects us all
# Forever in this half-light
# All desire
# The ashes and the fire
# Turning this night inside
# And the light from you

# Turning this night inside
# And the light from you
- That you, D?
- Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
- Fine. - (laughter)
- Morning.
- Morning.
Show me where things are, I'll make coffee.
- No, no.
Uh... - (Reba laughs)
- Don't go back inside the house.
- Why?
I left my purse inside.
I'll get it.
It's OK.
I mean...
I mean... you should stay outside.
It's... it's...
It's cos you look so good in the sun.
(laughing) OK.
OK.
(Reba sighs)
Um...
When, uh...
Reba, when can I see you again?
Oh.
Um...
Yeah, we can meet at my house.
- (Crawford) Lecktor called.
- I arranged for him to have a phone.
- I gotta call him in a minute.
- We identified the tyre tracks left when Lounds was delivered to the "Tattler".
G 7816 Goodyear truck tyres.
Looks like our boy drives a van.
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you comin' back?
When I'm done, Jack.
This is Will Graham of the FBI.
Dr Chilton arranged for me to talk to Dr Lecktor.
(ringing tone)
Hello?
(Lecktor) Hello, Will.
I wanna congratulate you for the job you did on Mr Lounds.
I admire that enormously.
Oh, what a cunning boy you are.
I'm sick of you crazy sons of bitches, Lecktor.
You got somethin' to say, say it.
I wanna help you.
You'll be more comfortable if you relax.
We don't invent our natures.
They're issued to us along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else.
- Why fight it?
- Fight what?
Did you really feel so depressed after you shot Mr Garrett Jacob Hobbes?
I didn't know you then, but I think you probably did.
But it wasn't the act that got you down, was it?
Didn't you feel so bad because killing him felt so good?
And why shouldn't it feel good?
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.
God's terrific.
He dropped a church roof on 34 of his worshippers last Wednesday in Texas, as they were grovelling through a hymn to his majesty.
Don't you think that felt good?
Why does it feel good, Dr Lecktor?
It feels good, Will, because God has power.
And if one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.
He got 140 Filipinos in one plane crash last month.
Remember that earthquake in Italy last spring?
(Graham) I enter.
The glass cutter.
The piece of glass I take out is mine.
The house is mine.
I walk up these stairs.
I pass the children's toys.
The children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.
(thunder)
I move to the door.
I step into the room.
I see you there.
And I see me desired by you, accepted, and loved,
in the silver mirrors of your eyes.
(# "Strong As I Am" by The Prime Movers)
# Father, look in my eyes

(knock at door)
- Who is it?
- It's me.
- Who?
Who is it?
- It's me.
- Francis?
- No.
Not Francis.
Francis is gone.
Francis is gone for ever.
So what are we doin'?
The dream.
He dreams about being wanted and desired.
So he changes people into beings who want and desire him.
- Changes?
- It's a word.
Killing and arranging the people to imitate it.
And Lecktor told me something.
"If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is."
You put it together, you get...
If our boy imitates being wanted and desired enough times, he believes he will become one who is wanted and desired and accepted.
It'll all come true.
This started from an abused kid.
A battered infant.
There's somethin' terrible about...
Are you sympathising with this guy now?
Absolutely.
My heart bleeds for him as a child.
Someone took a kid, and manufactured a monster.
At the same time, as an adult, he's irredeemable.
He butchers whole families to pursue trivial fantasies.
As an adult, someone should blow the sick fuck out of his socks.
Do you think that's a contradiction, Jack?
Does this kind of understanding make you uncomfortable?
What about the mirrors?
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.
But he doesn't take anything.
There's no souvenirs taken from the houses.
He needs souvenirs or trophies to relive the event.
Maybe he records it somehow.
So he could see himself accepted, over and over and over again.
VTRs?
Polaroids?
Stills?
What?
How do I know?
How does he find 'em?
We find out how he found them, we'll find him.
There is no connection between the two families.
- We've done a dozen computer runs.
- All the women have a bloom on them.
He didn't win them in a lottery.
He picked them.
There's selection and design in his choices.
Look.
Admit we struck out this month.
The Learjet is standing by.
The basic lab stuff is on it.
You, Zeller, Jimmy Price, the photographer.
Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour.
We get the call, we roll.
- The scene'll be fresh.
- It's not over yet.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
It's a foregone conclusion.
It's 11.30pm. The full moon is happening tonight.
Give it up!
Forget this month.
It's too late.
I gave it up.
Till you showed up with pictures of two dead families, knowing damn well that I'd imagine families three, four, five and six.
- You're fuckin' right!
I'd do it again!
- Great!
But don't talk to me about late!
I'll tell you when it's too fuckin' late!
Until then, we go as late as I wanna take it!
A padlock.
- That's why the bolt-cutter.
- What's that?
He used a bolt-cutter to trim the branch when he watched from the woods.
Why didn't he use it on the garage door?
Because a deadbolt was there when they were killed.
Donald Jacobi's 12th birthday party was April 14th.
Some time between April 14th and August 1, they changed the lock.
But he thought there was a padlock there.
From the street, you can't see the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door.
There's a big high fence there.
But he was ready with his glass-cutter.
So either he was casing far ahead, and we didn't check back far enough, or...
We checked.
Metcalf, it's Graham.
Is the Leeds and Jacobi stuff still in the storeroom?
Have the guard down there call me.
Do it.
You know that's the Jacobis' cat.
You brought a bolt-cutter cos you thought there was a padlock.
The Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar but you know it's theirs, don't you?
See the woman?
The bloom on the woman?
You can see her again and again, any time you want.
Doggy doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog.
And the Jacobi cat.
And the padlock on the door.
And you know you need a bolt-cutter and every other goddamn thing.
Cos everything with you is seeing, isn't it?
Your primary sensory intake that makes your dream live is seeing.
Reflections.
Mirrors.
Images.
You've seen these films.
Haven't you, my man?
- (phone rings)
- It's the guard in the storeroom.
- The cans.
- What cans?
The tapes were from home movies.
Where's the films' packaging?
There's films of the families in the document storage.
Find 'em.
You got 'em?
Are there any labels?
Leeds can, Gateway Lab, St Louis, Missouri.
The Jacobi label will say the same thing as the Leeds label.
Gateway Lab, St Louis, Missouri.
Who processed the Jacobi film?
No.
Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.
Stores send them out.
Have him peel the top label back.
Is there a label underneath?
It does, doesn't it?
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes to Meigs Field.
At Meigs Field, I want the Learjet prepped and a plan filed to St Louis.
Where are you?
Are you here?

We're lookin' for a man.
We know he works at Gateway.
We don't have his name, but we know he drives a van.
Under Employee Facilities, I got special stickers for vans.
Uh, yeah, I got 28, 29 van permits in the computer.
Start feeding' me names.
Is this Lieutenant Fisk?
Will Graham.
I need you to punch up the driver's licences of the names I'll feed you.
The man we're lookin' for is blond, Caucasian, 20-40 years old, over six feet tall, 180 to 225 pounds.

You guys better buckle up.
We're on approach to Lambert Field.
Fogle has four more names.
He knows two.
Both dark hair.
Third's a woman, fourth has a handicapped parking permit.
This is our man.
Rural Route 3, Chester.
Where is that?
From the airport you're closer.
We'll meet at the Hock Road off-ramp, Highway 94.
Let's go!
(# "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" by Iron Butterfly)
- Meet point's up ahead.
- Go on to the house.
- But Lieutenant Fisk said we...
- Go on to the house.
Will.
Will.
You're not gonna need that.
The SWAT team's gonna take him down, not us.
Will.
Will!
- This ought to be it, right here.
- Kill your lights.
- You all right?
- I'm OK.
Sherman's hurt bad.
I'll wait for the backup.
Set up a roadblock on Route 3.
Graham and I are in the trees west of the house.
- (Will) How far away's backup?
- Three minutes.
(Will) I'm goin' round the back.
Stay in the trees.
He's in there, Jack.
And he's got somebody in there with him.
What?
What... what did you say?
Will?
Wait for the backup, Will.
Will!
He's got somebody in the house with him, Jack.
Will.
Stop it.
Stop it!

Oh, it looks worse than it is, pal.
See the turtles?
Wow!

I thought I'd work things out... call you after.
I thought I wouldn't wait.

We should've talked at the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk about it here.
I'm not falling all over myself to talk about it much of anywhere, Jack.
How much do you know?
Not much.
The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago.
The second one in Atlanta was all over TV.
Did you ever think about giving me a call?
No.
Why not?
I quit.
Remember?
You look all right now.
I am all right.
If you can't look anymore, I understand.
Don't try to run a game down on me, Jack.
If I really didn't need you to come back, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks and a few days until the next full moon.
We have a better chance to get him fast if you help.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
Hi, Molly.
Think it'll keep them out, Dad?
Yep.
How many turtle eggs do you think are in here?
In this hatchery?
I'll bet there's 40 or 50 of them.
Crabs get most of the newborns, huh?
Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it, guaranteed.
What about the dogs?
Are they gonna get in here?
They can't dig under.
That's why we bury the wire down in the sand.
We need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be his friend, Jack.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, Molly,
I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.
We got it pretty good, don't we?
We have it more than good.
All that happened to you before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only look at evidence.
I wouldn't get deeply involved.
He'd never even see me or know my name.
If they find him, they'll have to take him down, not me.
What do you think?
I think you've already decided and you're not really asking.
If I were asking?
Stay here with me, me and Kevin.
But it's selfish, and I know it.
Come here.
OFFICER:
I'll come inside with you, if you want, to show you around.
Mr. Crawford said maybe you'd want to be alone, but...
That's right.
There's a VCR hooked up in your hotel room.
They transferred some home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen sliding door.
Used a glass cutter anchored to a suction cup.
His entry was skillful.
All the prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair, strong, size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood AB positive, typed from saliva on glass from licking the suction cup.
Why didn't he care that he left saliva on the glass?
It was hot out that night, so inside the house must have felt cool to him.
Intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he was rising, then shot Mrs. Leeds.
Bullet entered right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation.
Moderate elevation of serotonin and marked increase of free histamine level in gunshot wound indicates she lived at least five minutes after she was shot.
All her other injuries were post-mortem.
Direction and velocity of bloodstains on east wall indicate arterial spray.
Even with his throat cut, Leeds tried to fight because the intruder was moving to the children's room.
Bloodstains on west wall of master bedroom and matted sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained,
as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leed's chest, also believed to be post-mortem.
What did the killer do with them after they were dead?

Hello?
WILL:
Molly?
MOLLY:
Will, is that you?
Yeah, it's me, honey.
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
I love you.
I love you too, baby.
What are you dreaming?
That's something you can't afford for me to know about, isn't it?
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
It was maddening to have to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg, but there wasn't any talcum powder in the bathroom.
The talcum powder came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You touched her with your bare hands, and then you put your gloves back on.
But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so that they could see you?
JACK:
Hello?
Jack, this is Graham.
Is Price still in Latent Prints?
Yeah, he's in charge of the Single Print Index now.
What do you got, Will?
Get him to Atlanta.
Atlanta PD swears they dusted everything, and their guy is pretty good.
He is good.
He's not as good as Price.
I'll get him on a plane in the morning.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails and the corneas of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves.
Our people swear he wore surgeon's gloves the whole time.
They dusted everything.
Your report didn't mention eyes.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
WILL:
Because Mrs. Leeds was a beautiful woman.
This is what the subject's teeth looked like.
The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed these from the impressions that we took of the bite marks on the Leeds woman here and the Jacobi woman in Birmingham last month.
As you can see, he has pegged lateral incisors, that's these teeth here and here.
SPRINGFIELD:
Vice and Narcotics, you take the K-Y cowboys and leather bars.
Marcus, Whitman, heads up at the funeral.
The rest of your assignments are on the sheet.
Let's go.
One more thing.
I've heard officers referring to this killer as the Tooth Fairy.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Well, I don't want to hear that in public, and I don't want to see it in internal memoranda.
That's it.
(OFFICERS CHATTERING)
I know a burglar's gonna fence what he stole 'cause his motive is cash money.
I know his motive, so I go to work on fences.
This guy, we don't even have motive.
None of us have shit, and we know it.
WILL:
It's in his dreams.
His motive?
WILL:
Yeah.
His act fuels his fantasy.
Which is?
I don't know.
The commissioner was saying that you're the one who got Garrett Jacob Hobbs, and then Dr. Lecktor three years ago.
Lecktor killed nine people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
One's on a respirator at a hospital in Baltimore, the other's in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
(SNICKERS)
The psychologists call him a psychopath.
They don't know what else to call him.
I understand he cut you pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's.
The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen.
The Jacobis in Birmingham had a cat, didn't they?
That's right.
We found a litter box downstairs, but we didn't find a cat.
Why don't you get Birmingham PD a methane probe out of Washington, have them cover the back yard.
Maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
(PHONE RINGING)
SPRINGFIELD:
Yeah?
OVER PHONE:
This is Jimmy Price, FBI.
Let me put you on speakerphone.
Who am I talking to?
Jimmy, it's Jack Crawford.
You got Will Graham here, too.
I got a partial print with a tented arch, it's probably a thumb.
And the fragment of a palm off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.
Thumbprint came off the oldest kid's left eye.
It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.
Can we make an identification off of it?
Maybe, if he's ever been printed and he's in my index.
I want to work these up in my own darkroom.
I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon.
Thanks, Jimmy.
(REPORTERS CHATTERING)
No comment.
JACK:
If we get lucky with that print, we're in, if Jimmy can find him in the index and if he's ever been printed.
If not, I don't know.
Hey, Will Graham!
What do you say?
You remember me?
Freddie Lounds, covered the Lecktor case for the Tattler, did the paperback.
So, Will, when did they call you in?
What do you got?
Hey, look, I'm buying lunch.
Lounds, why don't you give it a rest?
Hey, he's news.
I'm doing my job.
So, how does this guy compare with Lecktor?
How does he do them?
How's he do them, Will?
(GROANS)
Keep the fuck away from me.
JACK:
Will, Will.
Son of a bitch snuck into the hospital while I was sedated after Lecktor.
He pulled back the sheets, and he took pictures.
Yeah, I know.
Look, don't expect too much from me, all right?
We only got three weeks left, and you're our best shot.
You think I'm gonna see him standing in the street and say, "There he is"?
That's Houdini you're thinking about.
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on until we get smart or get lucky.
He won't stop.
Why?
He's got a genuine taste for it.
You do know something about him.
Not enough.
I think I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mindset.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Yeah, I keep getting it for Christmas.
Did you get my card?
I got it.
Thank you.
How is Officer Stewart?
The one who was first to see my basement.
Stewart's fine.
Emotional problems, I hear.
Do you have any problems, Will?
No.
No, of course you don't.
(SNICKERS)
I'm glad you came.
My callers are mostly clinical psychologists from cornfield universities somewhere.
Second-raters, the lot.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
And?
Very interesting.
Even to a layman.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Yes, I thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Yes?
You read about it?
In the papers.
I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
I thought you might have some ideas.
Why should I tell you?
You'd get to see the file on this case.
And there's another reason.
Pray tell.
Thought you might be curious to see if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
Then by implication you think you're smarter than me, since you caught me.
No.
I know that I'm not smarter than you.
Then how did you catch me?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantages?
You're insane.
You are very tan, Will.
Your hands are rough.
They don't look like cop's hands anymore.
And that shaving lotion is something a child would select.
It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it?
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
I don't think I'll persuade you at all.
You'll either do it or you won't.
Besides, we have Dr. Bloom working on it, and he's the best.
Do you have the file with you?
Yes.
Pictures?
Yes.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
No.
Dream much, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file, and I'll tell you what I think.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
(PAGES FLIPPING)
This is a very shy boy, Will.
What were their yards like?
Big back yards.
Fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, my dear Will, if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he might go outside to look at it.
Have you ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy for this sort of thing.
That's interesting.
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.
I considered it.
You came here to look at me, to get the old scent back again, didn't you?
I want your opinion.
I don't have one right now.
Well, when you have one, I'd like to hear it.
Can I keep this?
I haven't decided yet.
I'll study them.
When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too.
You can call me.
When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone.
Would you like to leave me your home phone number?
No.
Do you know how you caught me?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You can leave messages for me.
LECKTOR:
Do you know how you caught me?
The reason you caught me, Will, is we're just alike.
Do you understand?
Smell yourself.

CAPTAIN ON PA SYSTEM:
Ladies and gentlemen, we are beginning our descent into Birmingham.
WILL:
You used a cutting tool on the branch so that you could see.
Then you passed the time whittling and dreaming.
When night came, you saw them pass by their bright windows.
Then you watched the shades go down, then you saw the lights go out, one by one.
Then after a while, you climbed down and you went in to them, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You watched them all goddamned day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
WILL:
I need Firearms and Tool Marks section out here on a severed branch.
I need to know what kind of cutting tool he used.
And then I need Bowman in Documents to fall on this carving.
JACK:
Is it weird?
The mark?
Yeah.
If Documents can't do the carving, I'll send it up to Langley.
WILL:
Did Price get an identification off the Leeds print?
No, Price hasn't found him in the index yet.
It's a hand search.
He's got half his department on it.
Listen, have you seen this week's Tattler?
(SCOFFS) It's not on my preferred reading list.
Well, your picture's all over the front page.
Who the hell was it?
Lounds?
Of course.
Who else?
God damn it, Jack!
I promised Molly!
I promised her!
Come in.
GUARD:
Dr. Chilton?
Yes?
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lecktor's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book.
We got him out of there and dug around.
Is that it?
Yes.
Put it down on my desk, Bonner.
Has anyone else seen this except you?
No.
SECRETARY:
Special Agent Crawford's office.
This is Dr. Chilton.
I need to speak to Mr. Graham right away.
He's not here, he's in Birmingham.
Special Agent Crawford is on the line with him now.
Please tell them this is very, very urgent.
I'll hold on.
Dr. Chilton, it's Jack Crawford.
You have Will Graham on the line, too.
CHILTON:
I have a note, or two pieces of a note that appears to be from that man who killed those people in Atlanta.
Where did you get it?
In Hannibal Lecktor's cell.
It was hidden in a book.
WILL:
Don't touch the note.
Can you read it to us?
It's written on toilet tissue.
"My dear Dr. Lecktor,
"I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me.
"I know that you alone can understand what I am becoming.
"You alone know the people I use to help me in these things
"are only elements undergoing change
"to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming,
"just as the source of light is burning.
"I have a collection of your press clippings.
"I think they are absurd, as are mine.
"'The Tooth Fairy,' what could be more inappropriate?
"Investigator Graham interests me,
"very purposeful-looking.
"I hope we can correspond."
There's a piece missing here.
Now I'll read the bottom part.
"After I hear back from you,
"I might send you something wet."
Signed "Avid Fan."
It has teeth marks pressed into it at the bottom.
Order a chopper, next thing smoking.
I don't care whose it is.
Two, call Alabama Air National Guard, get Graham back here right now.
Then call Documents and tell them to scramble a team.
I want everybody moving five minutes ago.
You understand?
JACK:
I have a Documents team on its way to you by helicopter to pick up the note.
Listen, after we've worked the note,
I want to replace it in Lecktor's cell.
I don't want Lecktor to know that we've found it, he might try to warn the killer somehow.
Where's Lecktor now?
CHILTON:
Holding cell.
How long can you keep him in there without him getting suspicious?
CHILTON:
Three, four hours.
Brian, we have a note coming in on the flight, possibly from the Tooth Fairy, number one priority.
It has to go to Hair and Fiber,
Latent Prints, and then Documents.
Will Graham and I will be walking it through.
One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.
And a couple of blue grains.
Work the hair.
What do we have for negative comparison?
Hair from Lecktor's comb, whiskers from Lecktor's razor they let him use.
This is hair from the security guard.
MAN:
How many guys handled this without gloves?
The guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
The cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had the oil washed off his fingers.
But the others...
One smudge.
Those aren't ridges.
It's just the texture of the paper.
I can fume for a print, but can't guarantee the iodine stains would fade out.
Ninhydrin?
Boost it with heat?
No.
We couldn't wash it after.
I can't get a print off this in the time you've got to get it back, Will.
BOWMAN:
How long do I have?
JACK:
Twenty minutes, max.
BOWMAN:
The main thing to find out is, how was Lecktor supposed to reply to him?
Which is probably the missing section, because at the top it says,
"I hope we can correspond," then comes the gap.
This note was written in ballpoint, but it looks like Lecktor went over this area with a felt-tip pen, then tore it away.
You're so sly, but so am I.
The aniline dyes used in the ink of the felt-tip pens like Lecktor used are transparent to infrared.
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.
This looks like the tip of a T here, here, and here.
At the end is what could be the top of an R.
There's three Ts and an R in "Tattler."
We know our boy reads it.
The article about me and Lecktor.
I don't know anybody else that's carried that.
Personal ads.
We believe the Tooth Fairy told Lecktor to reply to him through the personal ad section of the National Tattler.
The Chicago office is down there right now running through their ads.
We have cut into a line of communication between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor.
If we find Lecktor's reply we plan to pull it, substitute it with one of our own.
And this is what the Tooth Fairy will read.
Bill?
"Dear Avid Fan, inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements.
"Mementoes for you at Baltimore Central Left Luggage.
"Ticket number 72683."
It's a Secret Service letter drop.
We plan to stake it out.
When he shows, we'll grab him.
Anything from Chicago?
SARAH:
Not yet.
When do they go to press?
JACK:
Thirty-five minutes.
Christ.
Let's get to the physical.
There was no print.
Scale counts and core size of the hair match the blond hair found in the Jacobis'.
That note was written by your man.
Aside from the hair, three blue grains, dark flecks, went to Brian's end.
The grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine, from the cleaning man.
Several particles of dried blood, but not enough to type.
(PHONE RINGING)
OVER PHONE:
This is Chester.
Who am I talking to?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford.
Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in it being telexed to you right now.
Read it. "Dear Avid Fan,
"You honor me.
You're very beautiful."
JACK:
Oh, Christ.
"I offer 100 prayers for your safety.
"Find help in Galatians 6:11, 15:2,
"Acts 3:3, Revelations 18:7,
"Jonah 6:8, John 6:22,
"Luke 1:7."
JACK:
Thanks.
Jimmy.
Did you get anywhere at all identifying him off the Leeds' prints?
Not yet.
Photography at Langley?
They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.
No.
And our ad has to go out in the same book code Lecktor used, or he'll know it wasn't Lecktor talking to him.
Book code?
"100 prayers" could be the page number, the paired numbers could be line and letter.
But what book?
JACK:
Not the Bible?
No.
Galatians 15:2.
Galatians only has six chapters.
The same with Jonah 6:8.
Jonah only has four chapters.
Lecktor was not using the Bible.
Then the Tooth Fairy probably named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
Right.
What about sweating Lecktor?
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.
He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
JACK:
Wonderful.
The Tooth Fairy would have named a book he knew Lecktor has access to.
He'd know it from articles he'd read about Lecktor.
JACK:
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they can get everything back in place.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books.
JACK:
Where?
BOWMAN:
Library of Congress.
Twenty-five minutes.
He won't make it in time.
Lecktor's ad runs as is, we decode it later.
Or we pull it, figure out the code and run our own ad next week.
And lose a week?
We got 17 days till the next full moon.
And I don't like Lecktor's ad running without knowing what it says.
It's your call, Will.
Run it.
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something else beside write?
We'll all feel sick for a very long time.
JACK:
And if Bowman still can't figure it out?
Then we'll bait him with something else in next week's Tattler.
JACK:
What, for instance?
Me.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
Why not?
Don't you think we can provoke him?
Maybe.
Maybe he can be provoked.
What I was thinking about is you.
You're getting deeper and deeper into this.
Good night.
Sidney.
I'll talk to you.
Last time you did that you did a real good job of pushing yourself all out of shape.
You try it on again or you go through some big trauma, you could relapse, my friend.
Sidney, don't worry about me.
I'm working the evidence, making moves.
That's all.
I'm fine.
Bowman just struck out.
It is not books in Lecktor's cell.
Price?
He just heard.
It's a bust-out.
As evidence, the Leeds print will get us a conviction if we could ever find the guy.
But he must never have been printed because he is not in our index.
We are not gonna identify him off the print.
I'll use Lounds.
What for?
Our boy doesn't read the New York Times literary supplement.
He reads Lounds in the Tattler.
What else should we cover?
He put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.
I believe he did this to make sure we wouldn't think he was gay.
He's molested all of his male victims.
He may be impotent with members of the opposite sex.
Our forensic psychologists have projected, though I'm not sure, that he may have had sexual relations with his mother.
(LAUGHS)
So, how long do you plan to stay in Washington?
Till we've taken out the Tooth Fairy.
LOUNDS:
Can the Tattler rely on getting the straight stuff from you?
Absolutely.
How does working on this case affect your sex life?
Mine?
It doesn't affect mine, it affects yours.
Go fuck yourself.
Look, pal of mine, you're news.
Shoot the pictures.
All right, Symie, let's shoot them.
I'm in the shots with Graham.
What?
I'm in the shots with you.
Come on, you want this to look real or not?
Make sure the theater sign across the street is just slightly out of focus.
We want him to be able to read it so he can find it, but we don't want to look too obvious.
You make sure that I look excellent.
All right, shoot it.
One more.
One more.
That's enough.
Okay, Graham.
Hey, always nice, huh?
Let's have lunch, call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.
Dr. Bloom.
I need them on my desk in two hours.
Did Bowman break the code yet?
No.
Tools and Firearms say the cutting tool used on the severed branch was a common bolt cutter.
I got a call from Asian Studies at Langley.
The mark you found on the tree?
Yeah?
It's a Chinese character considered a lucky sign in gambling.
That same character appears on a Mah Jongg piece.
It means "Red Dragon." Mean anything to you?
No.
If he shows, and he's smart, he'll approach you from the front, pass, turn, try and take you from behind.
How's your hearing?
It's good.
You'll wear a wire, one-way.
We'll hear you, you won't hear us.
You checked out a Charter Arms .44 Special Bulldog?
Yeah.
Load these in it.
You ever fire them?
Glaser Safety Slugs.
Yeah.
Number 12 shots.
Suspended in liquid Teflon in a copper casing.
On impact it all opens up in the target.
Guaranteed one-shot stop.
You got body armor?
Yeah, Kevlar Second Chance.
I hope you get one.
'Cause he's gone for the head shot eight of eleven times?
Let's walk the route.
WOMAN ON PA:

Someone's coming.
(GRUNTS)
Go!
Don't!
Don't move!
Take the money!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Clear!
What you moving in slow motion for, man?
I'm being mugged!
For real.
Can you believe that?
Pay up.

(BREAKING)
You know who I am?
I don't want to know who you are.
According to you, I'm a sexual pervert.
"An animal," you said.
You know who I am now?
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Open your eyes.
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.
Your job is to report.
That's why you're here.
And if you don't open your eyes,
I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Well, here I am.
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)
Look at the screen.
William Blake's The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed In The Rays Of The Sun.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Leeds.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi.
Do you see?
Yes.
The next family as they will look when I go to visit them.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Leeds, later.
Her husband beside her.
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.
The Dragon rampant.
Freddie Lounds, your photograph.
No.
No what?
Not me, please.
Please.
Are you a man?
Yes.
Do you imply that I'm queer?
God, no.
Before me, you are a slug in the sun.
You are privy to a great becoming, and you recognize nothing.
You are an ant in the afterbirth.
It is your nature to do one thing correctly, tremble.
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, Lounds, you and the others, you owe me awe.
We have one more piece of work to do.
If he takes off the mask, I am a dead man.
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!
You will read this into the tape recorder.
Go.
"I have had a great privilege.
"I have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the Red Dragon.
"All I wrote about him were lies.
"Will Graham made me write them
"to pull him into a trap in Washington, District of Columbia.
"Will Graham, you will learn from my own lips
"how much you have to dread because I was forced to lie.
"He will be more merciful to me than to you.
"You will lie awake in fear of what the Red Dragon will do.
"I will be a testament to the truth of this."
(SHUDDERING)
You did very well.
Will you let me go now?
Please?
You will tell the truth?
I promise.
Good.
We'll seal your promise with...
We'll seal your promise
with a kiss.
(LOUNDS SCREAMING)
MAN ON RADIO:
We'll be showing five possible answers to the questions I'll be asking.
Any member of a team may buzz in an answer, but if incorrect, then the other team will have the opportunity...
(SQUEAKING)
(FIRE ROARING)
(WHEELCHAIR SQUEAKING)
(SCREAMING)
Bowman, just skip the cryptography and tell me what the hell it says, okay?
Did he try to say anything at all?
No, he sure didn't.
He never regained consciousness.
Did you hear the tape?
Yeah.
Listen, Bowman just broke the code that Lecktor used in the Tattler personal ad.
It was the State of Maryland statutes.
You need to know what it said right now.
What?
Listen to me.
Everything is okay.
I've taken care of it.
What is it, Jack?
The bastard gave him your home address.
It said, "Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway,
"Captiva, Florida.
"Save yourself.
Kill them all."
Get me a plane.
Will!
Mom.
Huh?
What time...
What?
Someone's outside.
There are noises.
Where?
Outside.
(WHISPERING) Mom...
Go back to your room and close the door.
Mom...
Do it now.
Ma'am, are you all right?
What?
What is it?
What is it?
What's going on?
OFFICER:
Ma'am, I think you should come back inside.
What's going on?
Come back inside.
Please.
I think you should come back inside.
I'm sorry, Molly.
I'm sorry about all of this.
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.
He's after you now, isn't he?
This is just a precaution.
Kevin, why don't you run down to the water, check out the dock?
I want to hang around here.
I'm in the kitchen, Mom.
Okay.
What is that about?
What, he's afraid to leave you alone with me now?
He saw the article in the Tattler, right?
I wanted to talk with him about it, but he said he wanted to bring it up to you, face to face.
Good for him.
Kevin, help me unpack, will you?
Then we'll go get some groceries.
You and Mom are very well-protected, you know.
No one's gonna find out where you are.
KEVIN:
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
No.
KEVIN:
This guy is trying to kill us?
We don't know that.
When are you going to kill him?
I'm not.
It's only my job to find him.
Barry's mom had this newspaper.
It said you were in a special hospital.
Well, it was a regular hospital, then I was transferred into the psychiatric wing.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
I don't know.
Was it because in the papers it said it was this man Lecktor?
Mmm-hmm.
What happened?
Well, Lecktor was attacking college girls, then he killed them.
How?
In bad ways.
He was a psychiatrist.
One of the girls was his patient, and I went to talk to him about her.
I tried to build feelings in my imagination like the killer had so that I would know why he did what he did, because that would help me find him.
When I was sitting in Lecktor's office and I looked up, I saw a book on his shelf.
It had pictures of war wounds in it.
And I knew it was him.
So I went to a pay phone down the hall to call the police and that's when he attacked me.
You and Mom came to see me in the hospital, and that helped a lot.
But after my body got okay,
I still had his thoughts going around in my head.
And I stopped talking to people.
And a doctor friend of mine, a Dr. Bloom, asked me to get some help.
And I did.
Then after a while I felt better, and I was okay again.
And the way he thought felt that bad?
Kevin, they're the ugliest thoughts in the world.
So, what kind of coffee do you like?
You like that Folgers stuff, right?
Yeah.
Mom likes that, too.
When can we go home, Dad?
I don't know, Kevin.
So, where are things?
Nowhere.
Everything we've tried is either a dead end or it's backfired.
Crawford's already planning the next crime scene so they can get it fresh.
We've got about six more days till the next full moon.
Can you quit?
No.
What's next?
I go to Atlanta.
Crawford?
No.
I have to be alone.
You're talking about doing exactly what you said you...
This killing, it's gotta stop.
William, you're gonna make yourself sick.
Or get yourself killed.
You and Kevin should go to Montana.
See your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.
And I'll come up and get you afterwards.
(WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA SYSTEM)
VALERIE ON ANSWERING MACHINE:
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry I can't come to the phone right now.
I'm sorry, too.
WAITRESS:
Excuse me.
Coffee.
It's just you and me now, sport.
I'm gonna find you, God damn it.
Mr. Dollarhyde?
Eileen.
Bill told me to tell you there was a variation in the gamma of number three.
But he caught it in time.
Eileen, good.
Good.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
REBA:
Who's there?
Mr. Dollarhyde.
I came about the low-light infrared emulsion.
REBA:
Oh, yeah.
Come on in, it's safe.
Put your back against the door.
There's a stool just to your right.
You're the production controller from Admin, right?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions?
Shooting from maybe eight feet.
I can't use any lights.
Okay, what's being photographed?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
Four days.
Okay, let me stick this in the black hole.
1000-C infrared sensitive has to be handled in total darkness.
Remember to be very careful with it.
But still, it's easier to handle than the 1200 series.
It'll be fine.
In case you're wondering,
I keep the samples straight by touch code.
No, I wasn't wondering.
Reba, I gotta fly.
Maybe Mr. Dollarhyde can drive you home tonight.
No, that's okay.
I'll take care of myself.
RALPH:
I can change things around.
No, thanks, go on.
Okay.
I'll take you.
No, thanks.
I'll order you 1200 feet of 1000-C in the morning.
Ride with me.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus.
I do it all the time.
Ride with me.
It would be because I would like you to.
Okay, sure.
Let me get my stuff on.
How did you come to Gateway?
Oh, they had to hire the handicapped to shape up their employment practices to get this defense contract.
You worked out well.
Everybody they hired did.
You know, you speak very well.
Although you avoid fricatives and sibilants.
At the Riker Institute for the Blind,
I trained in therapy for speech and hearing-impaired children.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Mmm-hmm.
You know, if you don't want to talk, that's okay.
But I hope you will, because you're very direct, and I like that, and I like what you have to say.
May I touch your face?
I want to know whether you're smiling or frowning.
I guess I want to know whether I should be quiet or not.
Take my word for it.
I'm smiling.
I didn't mean to offend you.
On the way, can I take you somewhere?
Where?
It would be my surprise.
Okay, sure.
Are you apprehensive?
No.
The very protective Mr. Dollarhyde over there is watching us.
No, no, I want to.
In about two hours we're going to cap his tooth.
REBA:
Yeah.
DOCTOR:
It's warm.
(HEART BEATING)
Back a little bit.
There.
You hear it?
Yeah.
You rearrange the dead families into an audience to see what you do.
You think that what you do will make you into something different.
You are becoming.
What is it you think you're becoming?
The answer is in the way you use the mirrors.
What do the mirrors make you dream you're becoming?
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)
A little to your left.
Francis, that was a great dinner.
Thank you.
I made you a gin and tonic.
It's right in front of you.
What are you watching?
It's just a little homework.
(THIS BIG HUSH PLAYING)
(INHALES DEEPLY)
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, D.
Is there a fire in the sky?
Your heart's loud.
Is there a moon up there?
If you'll hold me...
Is anything alive now?
This darkness is what I hear
This is a breathless silence
A moment out of time
I see your face in the shadows
The tell-tale signs are in your eyes
Aching with a passion inside
Deep as the river
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
Is there a flame in the dark?
Is there a bright heart star?
These creatures look the same now
We freeze wherever we are
We wake alone in the blackness
We sleep wherever we fall
One dream all around us
This big hush infects us all
Forever in this half-light
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
(CRYING)
And the light from you
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
REBA:
Is that you, D?
DOLLARHYDE:
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Hi.
(DOLLARHYDE CHUCKLES)
Good morning.
Morning.
You know, if you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee.
No, no...
Don't go back inside the house.
Why?
I left my purse inside.
I'll get it.
It's okay.
I mean, you should stay outside, it's...
It's...
It's 'cause you look so good in the sun.
(LAUGHING) Okay.
(SIGHS)
When...
Reba, when can I see you again?
Oh!
Um...
We could meet at my house.
JACK OVER PHONE:
You got the message Lecktor called?
Yeah.
I arranged for him to have a phone.
I gotta call him in a few minutes.
Good.
Listen, we identified the tire tracks left when Lounds was delivered back to the Tattler.
G-781 6 Goodyear truck tires.
Looks like our boy drives a van.
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you coming back?
When I'm done, Jack.
(PHONE RINGING)
Yeah, this is Will Graham of the FBI.
Dr. Chilton arranged for me to talk to Dr. Lecktor.
Hello?
LECKTOR:
Hello, Will.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds.
I admire that enormously.
Oh, what a cunning boy you are.
I'm sick of you crazy sons of bitches.
You got something to say, say it.
I want to help you.
You'd be more comfortable if you relax with yourself.
We don't invent our natures, they're issued to us, along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else.
Why fight it?
Fight what?
Did you really feel so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death?
I didn't know you then, but I think you probably did.
But it wasn't the act that got you down, was it?
Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?
And why shouldn't it feel good?
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.
God's terrific.
He dropped a church roof on 34 of his worshippers last Wednesday night in Texas as they were groveling through a hymn to his majesty.
Don't you think that felt good?
Why does it feel good, Dr. Lecktor?
It feels good, Will, because God has power.
And if one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.
He got 140 Filipinos in one plane crash last month.
Remember that earthquake in Italy last spring?
WILL:
I enter.
The glass cutter.
The piece of glass I take out is mine.
The house is mine.
I walk up these stairs,
I pass the children's toys.
The children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.
I move to the door.
I step into the room.
I see you there.
And I see me desired by you.
Accepted and loved in the silver mirrors of your eyes.
(STRONG AS I AM PLAYING)

See me as I really am

Now take me

I'm gonna talk to Fogel tomorrow...
Tell me how it feels now
Behold your flesh has come of age
RALPH:
Wait a minute.
Forsake me, you break me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that scares me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that dares me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that haunts me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that taunts me
Mother, let me heal you
Your pain has lasted far too long
Release it, it kills you
What was it?
Pollen.
Oh.
Thanks for the ride.
See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
The love you would not share grows tired of waiting
(GASPS)
Mr. Dollarhyde.
What are you doing here?
(GUN FIRING)
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that scares me
Strong as I am
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
REBA:
Who is it?
DOLLARHYDE:
It's me.
Who?
Who is it?
DOLLARHYDE:
It's me.
Oh.
Francis?
No, not Francis.
Francis is gone.
Francis is gone forever.
So, what are we doing?
The dream.
He dreams about being wanted and desired, so he changes people into beings who want and desire him.
Changes?
It's a word.
Killing and arranging the people to imitate it.
And Lecktor told me something.
If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
You put it together, you get, if our boy imitates being wanted and desired enough times, he believes he will become one who is wanted and desired and accepted.
It'll all come true.
This started from an abused kid, a battered infant.
There's something terrible about...
JACK:
What, are you sympathizing with this guy now?
Absolutely.
My heart bleeds for him as a child.
Someone took a kid and manufactured a monster.
At the same time, as an adult, he's irredeemable.
He butchers whole families to pursue trivial fantasies.
As an adult, someone should blow this sick fuck out of his socks.
Do you think that's a contradiction, Jack?
Does this kind of understanding make you uncomfortable?
What about the mirrors?
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.
But he doesn't take anything.
There's no souvenirs taken from the houses.
He needs souvenirs or trophies to re-live the event.
Maybe he records it somehow.
So he could see himself accepted over and over and over again.
VTRs, Polaroids, stills, what?
How do I know?
How does he find them?
When we find out how he found them, we'll find him.
There is no connection between the two families.
We've done a dozen computer runs.
Jack, all the women have a bloom on them.
He didn't win them in a lottery, he picked these women.
There's selection and design in his choices.
Look, admit we struck out this month.
The Lear Jet is standing by, the basic lab stuff is on it.
You, Zeller, Jimmy Price, the photographer, anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and 15 minutes.
We get the call, we roll.
The scene will be fresher than we've ever had it.
It's not over yet.
For Christ's sake!
That's a foregone conclusion.
It's 11:30 p.m., the full moon is happening tonight.
Give it up!
Forget this month, it's too damn late!
I gave it up.
Till you showed up with pictures of two dead families, knowing goddamn well that I'd imagine families three, four, five and six.
Right?
You're fucking right I did, and I'd do it again!
Great!
But don't talk to me about late, pal,
I'll tell you when it's too fucking late!
Until then, we go as late as I want to take it!
(WILL SIGHS)
A padlock.
That's why the bolt cutter.
What's that?
He used a bolt cutter to trim away the branch when he was watching from the woods.
Why didn't he use the bolt cutter on the garage door?
Because a deadbolt was there when they were killed.
Donald Jacobi's 12th birthday party was April 14th.
Sometime between April 14th and August 1 they changed the lock.
But he thought there was a padlock there.
From the street, you can't see the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door.
There's a big, high fence there.
But he was ready with his glass cutter.
So either he was casing far ahead and we didn't check back far enough,
or...
JACK:
We checked.
Don't talk.
Metcalfe, is the Leeds and Jacobi stuff still in the storeroom?
Have the guard down there call me.
Do it.
You know that's the Jacobis' cat.
You brought a bolt cutter 'cause you thought there was a padlock.
The Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog, don't you, my man?
See the woman?
The bloom on the woman?
You can see her again and again anytime you want.
Doggie doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog.
And the Jacobi cat.
And the padlock on the door.
And you know you need a bolt cutter and every other goddamn thing because everything with you is seeing, isn't it?
Your primary sensory intake that makes your dream live is seeing.
Reflections, mirrors, images...
You've seen these films.
Haven't you, my man?
(PHONE RINGING)
It's the guard in the storeroom.
The cans.
What cans?
The tapes were transferred from home movies.
Where's the packaging the films came in?
There's films of the families in the document storage.
Find them.
You got them?
Are there any labels?
Leeds can, Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
The Jacobi label will say the same thing as the Leeds label.
Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
JACK:
Who processed the Jacobi film?
No.
Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.
Stores send them out.
Have him peel the top label back.
JACK:
Is there a label underneath?
It does, doesn't it?
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes to Meigs Field.
At Meigs Field,
I want the Lear Jet prepped and a plan filed with St. Louis.
Where are you?
Are you here?
(IN-A-GADDA-DA-VIDA PLAYING)
You're scaring me with this!
Will you just stop it?
Francis, why are you doing this to me?
It's ugly!
Don't you know that I'll always be true?
Are you in this room?

You answer me!
And take my hand
Oh, won't you come with me
And walk this land
Please, take my hand

I've got special stickers for vans.
Yeah, I got 28, 29 van permits in the computer.

Stay in the trees.
He's in there, Jack.
And he's got somebody in there with him.
JACK:

We should have talked to the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk here.
I'm not falling over to talk about it much anywhere, jack.
How much do you know?
- Not much.
The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago, and Atlanta was all over TV.
Did you think about giving me a call?
- No. - why not?
I quit, remember?
You look alright now.
I am alright.
If you can't look anymore, I understand.
Don't play games with me!
If I really didn't need you, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks till full moon.
We have a better chance if you help me.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
Think it'll keep them out, dad?
- Yep.
How many turtle's eggs are in here?
- In this hatchery?
40 or 50 of 'em.
Crabs get most of them, huh?
- Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it.
What about the dogs?
No.
That's why we buried the wire down in the sand.
I need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be his friend.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, molly,
I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.
We've got it pretty good.
- More than good.
All that happened before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only look at the evidence.
I wouldn't get involved.
He'd never even see me.
If they find him, they'll have to take him down.
What do you think?
You've already decided and you're not really asking.
If I were asking?
Stay here with me.
Me and Kevin.
That's selfish and I know it.
I'll come inside with you and show you around.
Mr. Crawford said maybe you want to be alone.
- That's right.
There's a VCR in your hotel room.
There's home movies of both families on half inch VHS.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen door.
Used a glass cutter on a suction cup.
Entry was skilful.
All prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair, strong.
Size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood ab positive, from saliva on glass from the suction cup.
Why did he leave saliva on the glass?
It was hot that night, so it must have felt cool in the house.
Intruder cut Charles Leeds's throat then shot Mrs. Leeds.
Bullet lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation.
Moderate elevation of serotonin and an increase in histamine indicate she lived for 5 minutes after the shot.
All other injuries are post-mortem.
Direction of the blood stains on the wall indicate arterial spray.
Leeds tried to fight because intruder moved towards the children's room.
Blood stains on west wall in master bedroom and sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained,
as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leeds' chest.
Also believed post-mortem.
What did the killer do with them after they were dead?
Hi.
This is Valerie Leeds.
I can't speak right now, but if you leave a message after the beep, I'll get right back.
290th floor.
Going up.
When they were dead, he smashed the mirrors and selected pieces for use on Mrs. Leeds.
Killing Mr. Leeds and the children would take less than a minute.
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem 4 or 5 minutes later.
What did he do in the interval?
He smeared blood stains on the wall.
Hello?
- Molly?
Will, is that you?
- Yeah, honey.
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
I love you.
- I love you too, baby.
What are you dreaming?
That's something you can't afford for me to know about.
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
It was maddening to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg, but there wasn't any in the bathroom.
It came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you?
You touched her with your bare hands and then you put your gloves back on!
But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so they could see you?
Hallo?
- Jack, this is graham.
Is price still in latent prints?
- Yeah, the single print index.
What have you got?
- Get him to Atlanta.
Atlanta p.
D. Dusted everything and they're good.
- Not as good as price.
I'll send him tomorrow.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails and the corneas of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves.
The subject's teeth look like this.
These were reconstructed from the bite mark impressions we took from Mrs. Leeds and the jacobi woman.
He has pegged lateral incisors, that's these teeth here and here.
Vice and narcotics, you take the k-y cowboys and the leather bars.
Marcus, Whitman heads up at the funeral.
The rest, see the sheet.
One more thing.
I've heard officers call this killer the 'tooth fairy'.
Well, I don't wanna hear that in public or see it in memoranda!
That's it.
I know a burglar's gonna fence what he stole for cash money.
I know his motive, so I go to work on fences.
This guy, we don't have a motive.
None of us have shit and we know it.
It's in his dreams.
His motive?
- Yeah.
His act fuels his fantasy.
Which is?
- I don't know.
Commissioner says you're the one who got Garrett Jacob Hobbes and then dr.
Lecktor 3 years ago?
- Lecktor killed 90 people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
I heard he cut you pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's.
It has puncture wound.
The Jacobis had a cat.
That's right.
We found the litter box, but not the cat.
Give Birmingham p.
D. A methane probe out of Washington.
Have them cover the backyard.
Maybe the cat's buried there.
Yeah?
- This is Jimmie price, fbi.
Let me put you on the speaker.
- Who am I talking to?
Jack Crawford and will graham.
I got a partial print, probably a thumb.
And a fragment of a palm off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.
Thumb print came off the oldest kid's left eye.
Can we make an identification off it?
- Maybe if he's in my index.
Wanna work on these in the dark room.
I'll fax the prints this afternoon.
- Thanks.
If we get lucky with that print... if Jimmie can find him in the index.
- Hey, graham!
Whatta you say?
It's me, Lounds, from the "tattler".
I did the Lecktor paperback.
When did they call you in?
I'm buying lunch, alright?
- Give it a rest!
I'm doing my job.
How does he compare to Lecktor?
What does he do to them?
How does he do 'em, will?
Keep the fuck away from me!
- Will, will!
Son-of-a-bitch snuck into the hospital while I was sedated and took pictures.
I know.
- Don't expect too much from me.
We only got three weeks left.
- You think I'm just gonna see him?
That's Houdini!
The tooth fairy's gonna go on till we get smart or lucky.
He won't stop.
Why?
He's got a taste for it.
- You do know something about him.
Not enough.
I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mind set.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court 3 years ago.
I keep getting it for Christmas.
Did you get my card?
- I got it, thank you.
How is officer Stuart?
Fine.
- Emotional problems, I hear.
Do you have any problems, will?
- No.
No, of course you don't.
I'm glad you came.
My callers are usually psychologists from cornfield universities.
Second-raters, the lot.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction.
- And?
Very interesting, even to a layman.
I want you to help me, dr.
Lecktor.
- I thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
- Yes?
- you read about it?
In the papers.
I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing them.
Any ideas?
- Why should I tell you?
You get to see the file.
There's another reason.
- Pray tell.
You might be curious to see if you're smarter.
Smarter than you, since you caught me?
I know I'm not smart.
- Then how did you catch me?
Your disadvantages.
- What disadvantages?
You're insane.
You're very tanned, will.
Your hands are rough.
Not cop's hands any more.
And that shaving lotion is from a child?
With a ship on the bottle?
Don't think appeals to my intellectual vanity will work.
I don't think that.
You'll do it or you won't.
Dr. Bloom's working on it.
He's the best.
Have you got the file?
- Yes. - pictures?
- yes.
Let me have them and I'll consider it.
- No.
Dream much, will?
Goodbye, dr.
Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file and I'll tell you what I think.
This is a very shy boy.
What were the yards like?
- Big, fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, if he imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he'll go look outside.
Ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy.
Interesting.
No.
You thought of it before.
- I considered it.
You wanted to look at me.
To get the scent back.
- I want your opinion.
I don't have one now.
- When you do, I want to hear it.
Can I keep this?
- Haven't decided.
- I'll study them.
Also any other files.
You can call me.
For calls to my lawyer I get a phone.
Will you leave me your home number?
No.
Do you know how you caught me?
There's a number on the file.
- Do you know how you caught me?
You caught me, will, because we're just alike.
You want the scent, smell yourself!
Gotcha!
Get up and face the wall.
Don't turn around, or I'll mace you in the face.
Thank you so much.
I'll call when I'm finished.
You ready for your call?
- Yes, thank you.
Paltrow, Christiansen and Golub, law offices.
I'm sorry, I misdialed.
Thank you for using ATT.
This is operator 24.
Operator, I don't have the use of my arms.
Would you dial a number for me?
- Certainly.
What's the number?
Area code 3-0-1.
5-5-5-6-6-2-4.
University of Chicago, department of psychiatry.
- Dr. Bloom, please.
I'll connect you with his office.
What's his secretary's name?
- Martha king.
Just a moment.
Martha king's desk.
- Hi, Martha.
Martha doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob Greer.
Dr. Bloom asked me to send a paper to someone, but I never got the address or number.
- She'll be in in the morning.
I've got to catch the federal express.
Could you pull it out of her rolodex?
I don't see a rolodex.
- I bet she has a call caddy.
Yeah.
- Well point right on down to g.
Alright.
- The last name is graham.
The man the book is for.
Mr. Will graham.
Federal bureau of investigation, 10th and Pennsylvania, Washington d.
C.
I bet his home address is there too.
3680 Desoto highway, Captiva, Florida.
Thank you very much.
Finished!
Mommy!
- Oh my gosh!
Lt's ok.
Stewardess?
There's a couple down from Duluth, we were talking about mortgages.
And...
I figure, you're gonna unload this turkey.
Well, then the squad car rolls up, they start asking questions, the whole grand tour:
Who was lying where and what.
Terrific.
So they get in their sedan and get the hell out of here.
Any single men ask to see the house?
No-one asked me.
You cut the branch so you could see.
Then you passed the time whittling and dreaming.
When night came, you saw them behind bright windows.
You watched the shades go down, saw the lights go out one by one.
Then you went in to 'em,
Didn't ya?
Didn't you, son-of-a-bitch?
You watched them all day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
I need the firearms and toolmarks section on the severed branch.
I need bowman to fall on this carving.
- Is it weird?
The mark?
Yeah.
If documents can't do it, Langley can.
- Did price get an identification?
No, not yet.
It's a hand search.
Have you seen the "tattler"?
It's not on my reading list.
- Yeah, well, you're all over the front page.
Who the hell was it, Lounds?
- Who else?
Goddammit, jack!
I promised molly.
Come in!
- Dr. Chilton?
- yes?
On cleaning out dr.
Lecktor's cell, he hid something in a book.
We dug around.
- Is that it?
Put it down.
Has anyone seen this except you?
- No.
Crawford's office.
- This is Chilton.
Mr. Graham please!
He's not here.
Mr. Crawford is on the line with him now.
Will you tell him this is very, very urgent.
I'll hold on.
Dr. Chilton, it's Crawford.
Graham is on the line, too.
I have two pieces of a note that appears to be from the murderer in Atlanta.
Where did you get it?
- Hidden in a book in Lecktor's cell.
Don't touch the note.
Read it to us!
- It's on toilet tissue.
"Dear dr.
Lecktor,
I am delighted that you've taken an interest in me.
You alone can understand what I am becoming.
You know the people I used to help me are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.
Just as the source of light is burning.
My collection of your press clippings is as absurd as are mine.
The "tooth fairy".
What could be more inappropriate?
Investigator graham interests me.
Very purposeful-looking.
I hope we can correspond."
There's a piece missing.
I'll read the bottom part.
"After I hear from you, I might send you something wet."
Signed: "avid fan." There are teeth marks at the bottom.
Order a chopper.
Don't care whose.
2. call Alabama air national guard, get graham back here right now.
Call documents and scramble a team.
I want everybody moving'.
The documents team is underway to pick up the note.
Listen, I wanna replace the note.
I don't want Lecktor to know.
He might try to warn the killer.
Where's Lecktor?
- Holding cell.
How long can you keep him in there?
- Three, four hours.
We have a note coming in, possibly from the tooth fairy.
No. 1 priority.
Has to go to hair and fiber.
One hair.
Maybe half an inch.
Couple of blue grains.
- Work the hair.
What do you have as a negative comparison?
- Lecktor's comb.
Whiskers from a razor, hair from the security guard.
How many handled this without gloves?
Guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
- The cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had the oil washed off his fingers.
But the others... one smudge.
No ridges, it's just the texture of the paper.
I can fume it but I can't say the iodine stains will fade.
- Ninhydrin?
Boosted with heat?
- No.
You couldn't wash it out.
I can't get a print in the time.
How long?
- 20 minutes max.
Main thing is, how was Lecktor supposed to reply?
It's probably in the missing section.
'I hope we can correspond'.
Then comes the gap.
This note was written in ballpoint.
But it looks like Lecktor went over this area with a felt-tip pen and tore it away.
You're so sly, but so am I.
The aniline dyes in the felt-tip pens, like Lecktor used, are transparent to infrared.
The tooth fairy's ballpoint isn't.
This looks like the tip of a t.
This one could be the top of an r.
- Three t's and an r in "tattler".
The article about me and Lecktor.
No-one else carried that.
Personal ads.
The tooth fairy told Lecktor to reply through the personal ads in the "tattler".
Chicago is running through them right now.
Here is a line of communication between the tooth fairy and Lecktor.
If we find Lecktor's answer, we'll replace it with our own.
This is what he'll read:
"Dear avid fan:
Inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements.
Mementos for you at Baltimore central.
Left luggage.
Ticket 7-2-6-8-3."
It's a letter drop.
We stake it out and grab him.
Anything from Chicago?
- Not yet.
- When do they go to press?
In 35 minutes.
- Christ!
- Let's get to the physical.
There was no print.
- The core size of the hair matches the blond hair found in the Jacobi's.
Your man wrote the note.
Three blue grains went to Brians's end.
Commercial granulated cleanser from the cleaning man.
Particles of dried blood, but not enough to type.
This is Chester, who's there?
- Will graham, jack Crawford.
Got a personal ad with "avid fan" in it.
- Read it!
"Dear avid fan, you honor me.
You're very beautiful.
One hundred prayers for your safety.
Find help in Galatians 6, 11 and 15,2.
Acts 3,3; revelations 18,7.
Jonah 6,8; john 6,22;
Luke 1,7.
Thanks.
Jimmie, get anywhere with the Leeds print?
- Not yet.
Cryptography at Langley?
- They're working on the telex now.
No.
Our ad has to go out in the same book code, or he'll know.
Book code?
"100 prayers" could be a page number and the paired numbers lines.
Galatians only has six chapters.
Same with Jonah, it only has four.
Lecktor was not using the bible.
The tooth fairy probably named the book in the part torn out.
What about sweating' Lecktor?
We tried sodium amytal 3 years ago, and he gave 'em a recipe for a chip dip.
- Wonderful.
The tooth fairy knows which book.
He'd know from articles about Lecktor.
Willingham took polaroids of Lecktor's cell.
Have him meet me.
- Where?
- library of congress.
25 minutes.
He won't make it.
Lecktor's ad runs as is, or we pull it and run our own ad next week.
- We got 17 days left till full moon!
I don't like Lecktor's ad running without knowing what it says.
It's your call, will.
Run it.
And what if it encourages the tooth fairy to do something else?
Then we'll all feel sick.
And if bowman can't figure it out?
Then we'll bait him with something else in the "tattler".
- What?
Me.
That's not a very good idea.
Why not?
Won't it provoke him?
- Maybe.
I was thinking about you.
You're getting in deeper and deeper.
Sidney?
The last time you pushed yourself all outta shape.
Try it on again, or if you go through some trauma, you could relapse.
Sidney, don't worry about me.
I'm workin' the evidence, makin' moves, that's all.
I'm fine.
Bowman says it is not books in Lecktor's cell.
Price?
- It's a bust out.
The Leeds' print will get us a conviction.
He must never have been printed, because he is not in our index.
We are not gonna identify him off the print.
I'll use Lounds.
What for?
Our boy doesn't read the times.
He reads Lounds in the "tattler".
What else should we cover?
- He put the shorts on Leeds after he was dead, so we wouldn't think he was gay.
He molested all his male victims and may be impotent with women.
Our forensic psychologists have projected that he may have had sexual relations with his mother.
How long will you stay in Washington?
- Till we've got the tooth fairy.
Will the "tattler" get the stuff?
How's your sex life been affected?
Mine?
Lt doesn't.
It affects yours!
Fuck yourself!
Look, pal, you're news!
- You shot the pictures.
Alright.
I'm in the shots with graham.
- What?
- yeah.
Come on!
You want this to look real?
Make sure the theater sign is just out of focus.
We want him to read it.
- And make sure I look excellent!
Shoot it!
One more.
One more.
- That's enough.
Ok, graham.
Always nice, huh?
Let's have lunch, call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.
Dr. Bloom.
L need them on my desk in 2 hours.
- Ok.
Did bowman break the code yet?
- No.
They say the cutting tool was a common bolt cutter.
I got a call from Asian studies in Langley.
The mark on the tree is a Chinese lucky sign in gambling.
The same character appears in mah-jongg.
Lt means red dragon.
Mean anything to you?
No.
If he shows and he's smart, he'll approach from the front, pass, turn and try and take you from behind.
How's your hearing?
- Good.
You'll wear a wire, one way.
We'll hear you, but you won't hear us.
Checked out a 44 special bulldog?
Load these in it.
You ever fire 'em?
- Glaser safety slugs?
Opens up on impact.
Guaranteed one shot stop.
You got body armor?
- Kevlar second chance.
Hope you get one.
- 'Cause he goes for the head shot?
Let's walk the route.
United flight 8490 to Newark now boarding at gate 7.
United flight 8490 to Newark now boarding at gate 7.
Can you get to a phone?
So where are things?
Got nine days left.
We're working on it.
You don't wanna talk about what you're doing, do you?
Hotel rooms... an illicit romance... we have to stop meeting like this.
Remember the first time we met?
Yeah.
We were alone together in that room.
Though I'd never seen you before, we were sitting there, speaking.
A shadow flickered across your face.
L said, "what's that?"
Remember what you said?
I said:
"This is too good to believe."
Time is luck, will.
You know the value of every day.
Someone's coming.
Go!
Don't!
Don't move!
Take the money!
Don't shoot!
Clear!
Quicker, man!
I'm being mugged!
Do you know who I am?
- I don't wanna know who you are.
You said I'm a sexual pervert.
'An animal' you said.
Do you know who I am now?
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Open your eyes!
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.
That's why you're here.
Open your eyes or I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Well, here I... am.
Look at the screen.
William Blake's 'the great red dragon' and 'the woman clothed in the rays of the sun'.
Do you see?
- Yes.
Mrs. Leeds.
Do you see?
- Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi.
Do you see?
- Yes.
The next family as they will look.
Do you see?
- Yes.
Mrs. Leeds, later.
Her husband beside her.
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.
The dragon rampant.
Freddie Lounds.
Your photograph.
No!
- No what?
- Not me, please!
Please!
- Are you a man?
- yes.
Do you imply that I'm queer?
- God, no!
Before me you are a slug in the sun.
You are privy to a great becoming and you recognise nothing!
You are an ant in the afterbirth!
It is your nature to do one thing correctly... tremble.
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, Lounds, you and the others owe me awe!
One more piece of work to do.
If he takes off the mask, I'm dead now!
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!
Read this into the tape recorder.
Go.
"I have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the red dragon.
All I wrote about him were lies.
Will graham made me write them to pull him into a trap.
Will graham, you will learn how much you have to dread, because I lied.
He will be more merciful to me.
You will lie awake in fear of what the red dragon will do.
I will testify to the truth of this."
You did very well.
Will you let me go now?
Please?
You will tell the truth?
- I promise.
Good.
We'll seal your promise with... we'll seal your promise
with a kiss.
Only five answers are possible.
Any member of a team may buzz in and answer.
Bowman, skip the cryptography and tell me what it says!
Did he try to say anything at all?
- No.
He never regained consciousness.
Did you hear the tape?
- Yes.
Listen, bowman just broke Lecktor's code in the personal ad.
It's the state of Maryland statutes.
You need to know, now.
- What?
Listen to me.
I've taken care of it.
What is it, jack?
The bastard gave him your address.
It said: "graham home, 3860 Desoto highway, captiva, Florida."
Save yourself.
Kill them all.
Get me a plane!
- Will!
Will!
Mom?
Huh?
What?
Someone's outside.
I hear noises.
- Where?
- outside.
Go back to your room and close the door.
Mom?
- Do it, now!
Mom, are you alright?
- What?
What is it?
What is it?
What's going on?
Come back inside!
What's going on?
- Come inside!
- So what...?
- come back inside!
I'm sorry, molly.
I'm sorry about all of this.
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.
He's after you now, isn't he?
- It's just a precaution.
Kevin?
Run down to the water and check the out dock.
I wanna hang around here.
I'm in the kitchen, mom.
What's that about?
He's afraid to leave you alone with me now?
He saw the article in the "tattler".
I wanted to talk to him, but he said he'd bring it up with you.
Good for him.
Kevin, help me unpack and then we'll get some groceries.
You and mom are well protected.
No one's gonna find you.
Is there anything I need to know, to see about mom?
No.
This guy's planning to kill us?
- We don't know that.
When you gonna kill him?
I'm not.
It's only my job to find him.
In the newspaper it said you were in a special hospital.
Well, it was a regular hospital, then I was transferred to the psychiatric wing.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
I don't know.
Was it because of this man Lecktor?
What happened?
Lecktor attacked college girls and he killed them.
How?
In bad ways.
He was a psychiatrist.
One of the girls was his patient and I went to talk to him about her.
I tried to build up feelings like the killer had, so I would know why he did it 'cause that would help me find him.
I was sitting in Lecktor's office and saw a book on a shelf with pictures of war wounds.
And I knew it was him.
So I went to a pay phone to call the police.
That's when he attacked me.
You and mom... came to see me in hospital and that helped a lot.
But after my body got ok,
I still had his thoughts in my head.
I stopped talking to people.
A doctor friend, dr.
Bloom asked me to get help, and I did.
And after a while I felt better and I was ok again.
And the way you thought...
felt that bad?
Kevin, the ugliest thoughts in the world.
What kind of coffee you like?
What?
You like that Folger's stuff, right?
- Yeah.
Mom too.
When can we go home, dad?
- I don't know, Kevin.
So where are things?
Nowhere.
Everything we've tried is a dead end or has backfired.
Crawford is planning the next crime scene.
Six days till full moon.
- Can you quit?
No.
What's next?
I go to Atlanta.
- Crawford?
No.
I have to be alone.
You're talking about doing exactly what... - this killing it's gotta stop!
William, you're going to make yourself sick, or get killed.
You and Kevin should go to Montana, see your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.
I'll come and get you afterwards.
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
I'm sorry I can't come to the phone.
I'm sorry too.
- Excuse me?
- coffee.
Just you and me now, sport.
I'm gonna find you, goddammit!
Mr. Dollar Hyde?
- Oh, Eileen.
- Bill says there's a variation in the gamma number 3, but he caught it in time.
Good.
Good.
Who's there?
- Mr. Dollar Hyde.
I came about the infrared emulsion.
- Come in.
Lt's safe.
Put your back against the door.
Stool to the right.
You're the production controller?
What are the conditions?
- Shooting from 8 feet.
I can't use any lights.
- What's being photographed?
Nocturnal animals.
- When do you need it?
In four days.
- Ok.
I'll stick this in a black bag.
1000 c infrared-sensitive has to be handled in total darkness.
Remember to be careful.
It's easier than the 1200 series.
Fine.
- In case you're wondering, I keep the samples by touch.
I was wondering...
I gotta fly.
Perhaps Mr. Dollar Hyde can drive you home.
No, that's ok.
No thanks.
Go on.
I'll take you.
- No thanks.
I'll order 1200ft of 1000 c tomorrow.
Ride with me!
- No thanks!
I'll take the bus.
Ride with me!
I would like you to.
Ok, sure.
I'll just get my stuff on.
How did you come to gateway?
They had to hire the handicapped to get this defence contract.
- You worked out well.
Everybody they hired did.
You speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants.
I trained in therapy for speech and hearing-impaired children.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
If you don't wanna talk, that's ok.
You're very direct, I like that.
I like what you have to say.
May I touch your face?
Are you smiling or frowning?
I guess I wanna know whether I should be quiet or not.
Take my word for it,
I'm smiling.
- I didn't mean to offend you.
Can I take you somewhere?
- Where?
It will be my surprise.
Ok.
Sure.
Are you apprehensive?
- No.
The protective Mr. Dollar Hyde is watching us.
- I want to!
In about two hours we're going to cap his tooth.
It's warm.
There... hear it?
You... rearrange the dead families into an audience.
You think what you do makes you into something different.
You're becoming... what is it you're becoming?
The answer is in the way you use the mirrors.
What do the mirrors make you dream?
A little to your left.
Francis, that was a great dinner.
There's a gin and tonic, right in front of you.
What are you watching?
A little homework.
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, d.
Your heart's loud if you love me.
Is that you, d.?
- Are you ok?
- yeah, I'm fine.
Morning.
- Morning.
If you show me, I'll make us some coffee - no!
Don't go back inside the house.
- I left my purse inside.
I'll get it, it's ok.
I mean, you should stay outside.
You look so good in the sun.
When...
Reba, when can I see you again?
We could meet at my house.
You got the message Lecktor called?
Yeah.
I'll call him in a few minutes.
We identified the tire tracks when Lounds was delivered to the "tattler".
G-7816, goodyear truck tires.
Our boy drives a van.
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you back?
When I'm done, jack.
Will graham of the fbi.
I'd like to talk to dr.
Lecktor.
Hello?
Hello, will.
Congratulations on the job you did on Mr. Lounds.
I admired it.
What a cunning boy you are.
I'm sick of you, Lecktor.
You've got something to say, say it!
I want to help you.
Relax with yourself!
We don't invent our natures, they're issued to us with our lungs and pancreas and everything else.
Why fight it?
Fight what?
Did you really feel depressed after you shot Hobbes to death?
I think you probably did.
But it wasn't the act that got to you.
Didn't you feel so bad, because killing him felt so good.
It must feel good to god.
He does it all the time.
God's terrific.
He dropped a church roof on 34 worshippers last Wednesday, while grovelling through a hymn.
Don't you think that felt good?
Why does it feel good, dr.
Lecktor?
It feels good, because god has power.
If one does what god does, enough times, one will become as god is.
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.
He got 140 Philippines in one plane crash last year.
Remember that earthquake in Italy last spring?
I enter.
The glass cutter.
The piece of glass is mine.
The house is mine.
I walk up these stairs,
I pass the children's toys.
The children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.
I move to the door.
I step into the room.
I see you there.
I see me desired by you.
Accepted and loved.
In the silver mirrors of your eyes.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Ok.
Wait a minute.
What was it?
- Pollen.
Oh.
- See you tomorrow.
Mr. Dollar Hyde.
What are you doing here?
Who is it?
- It's me.
Hallo?
Who is it?
- It's me.
Francis?
- No.
Not Francis.
Francis is gone.
Francis is gone, forever.
So what do we do?
The dream.
He dreams about being desired.
So he changes people into beings who want and desire him.
Changes?
- It's a word.
Killing and arranging the people to imitate it.
Lecktor told me something.
If one does what god does enough times, one will become as god is.
You put it together, our boy imitates being wanted and desired enough times, he believes he'll become one who is wanted and desired.
It'll all come true.
What about the mirrors?
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.
But he doesn't take anything.
He needs souvenirs from the houses, so he can relive the event.
Maybe he records it somehow.
So he can see himself accepted over and over and over again.
Vtr's, polaroids, stills, what?
- How do I know?
How does he find them?
If we find out how he found them, we'll find him.
There is no connection between the two families.
All the women have a bloom on them.
He picked these women!
There's selection and design here.
- Look, admit we struck out this month.
The lear jet is standing by with the lab.
You, zeller, Jimmie price, the photographer.
We can be anywhere in 75 minutes!
We get the call, we roll!
This thing'll be fresh!
- It's not over yet.
It's a foregone conclusion.
It's 11.30pm. The full moon is tonight.
Give it up!
It's too damn late!
- I gave it up.
Till you showed up with pictures of two dead families!
Fuckin' right!
I'd do it again!
- Great, but don't talk to me about late, pal!
I'll tell you when it's too late.
A padlock.
That's why the bolt cutter.
What's that?
Why didn't he use the bolt cutter on the garage door?
Because a deadbolt was there when they were killed.
Donald Jacobis birthday party was April 14th.
Sometime between April and august they changed the lock, but he thought there was a padlock.
From the street you can't see the glass on the Leeds' kitchen door.
There's a big, high fence there, but he was ready with his glass cutter.
Either he was casing far ahead, and we didn't check back far enough, or... we checked.
Metcalf, it's graham.
Ls the Leeds and Jacobi stuff still there?
Have the guard down there call me.
Do it!
You know that's the Jacobi's cat.
He brought a bolt cutter, because he thought there was a padlock.
Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar, but you know it's their dog.
You see the woman?
The bloom on the woman?
You can see her again and again, anytime you want.
Doggie doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog... and the Jacobi cat... and the padlock on the door.
You know you need a bolt cutter.
Because everything with you is seeing.
Your primary sensory intake, making your dream live is seeing.
The reflections... mirrors... images... you've seen these films!
Haven't you, my man?
The guard in the storeroom.
The cans!
- What cans?
- The tapes were transferred.
Where's the packaging of the films.
- There are films in storage.
You got 'em?
Are there any labels?
Leeds, gateway lab, st.
Louis, Missouri.
The Jacobi label says the same thing:
Gateway lab, st.
Louis.
Who processed the Jacobi film?
Bob's photo store, Birmingham.
Stores send 'em out.
Have him peel the top label back.
Is there a label underneath?
It does, doesn't it?
I want a chopper in three minutes to meigs field.
At meigs field I want the lear jet prepped for st.
Louis.
Where are you?
Are you here?
You're scaring me!
Stop it!
Francis, why are you doing this to me?
It's ugly.
Are you in this room?
Where?
You answer me!
We're looking for a man.
We know he works at gateway.
We don't have his name, but we know he drives a van.
I got special stickers for vans.
I got 28 van permits here.
- Start feeding me names.
Is this lieutenant Fisk?
Will graham.
I need you to get the driver's licenses of these names.
The man we're looking for is blond, Caucasian, 20-40 years old, over six feet tall, 180-225 pounds.
First name?
A-l-v-a-r-o.
First name Joseph.
A-l-v-a-r-o, first name Joseph.
No.
Black hair.
No.
- Next.
Dillon, d-l-l-l-o-n.
First name Lincoln.
- Dillon.
D-l-l-l-o-n, first name Lincoln.
No.
Next.
Male, Caucasian, 6ft 7 inches, 217 pounds, eyes brown, hair blond.
34 years old.
- Put it through the data fax.
Fast!
Buckle up.
We're landing in Lambert field.
Fogel has four more names.
Two have dark hair.
Third's a woman.
Fourth is a handicapped permit.
This is our man.
Rural route 3, Chester, Missouri.
Where is that?
We're 10.25 at the hock road off ramp, highway 904.
Let's go!
Meeting point's up ahead.
- Go on to the house.
Lieutenant Fisk said...
- go on to the house!
Will?
Will, you won't need that.
The swat team will take him down, not us.
Will?
This ought to be it.
- Kill your lights!
Alright?
- I'm ok.
Griffin's hurt bad.
I'll wait for the back-up.
Set up a road block on route 3!
We're in the trees west of the house.
How far away's the back-up?
I'm goin' around the back, stay here.
He's in there, jack.
Someone is with him.
What?
Will, what did you say?
Wait for the back-up!
He's got someone with him, jack.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Who are you?
Graham.
I'm will graham.
Looks worse, than it is.
See the turtles?
It was on the news.
I thought I'd work things out... and call you after.
I thought I wouldn't wait.
How many of them made it?
Most of 'em.
We should have talked to the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk here.
I'm not falling over to talk about it much anywhere, Jack.
- How much do you know?
- Not much.
The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago, and Atlanta was all over TV.
- Did you think about giving me a call?
- No.
- Why not?
I quit, remember?
You look alright now.
I am alright.
If you can't look anymore, I understand.
Don't play games with me!
If I really didn't need you, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks till full moon.
We have a better chance if you help me.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
- Think it'll keep them out, Dad?
- Yep.
- How many turtle's eggs are in here?
- ln this hatchery?
40 or 50 of 'em.
- Crabs get most of them, huh?
- Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it.
What about the dogs?
No.
That's why we buried the wire down in the sand.
I need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be his friend.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, Molly, I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.
- We've got it pretty good.
- More than good.
All that happened before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only look at the evidence.
I wouldn't get involved.
He'd never even see me.
If they find him, they'll have to take him down.
What do you think?
You've already decided and you're not really asking.
If I were asking?
Stay here with me.
Me and Kevin.
That's selfish and I know it.
I'll come inside with you and show you around.
- Mr.Crawford said maybe you want to be alone.
- That's right.
There's a VCR in your hotel room.
There's home movies of both families on half inch VHS.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen door.
Used a glass cutter on a suction cup.
Entry was skilful.
All prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair, strong.
Size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood AB positive, from saliva on glass from the suction cup.
Why did he leave saliva on the glass?
It was hot that night, so it must have felt cool in the house.
Intruder cut Charles Leeds's throat then shot Mrs. Leeds.
Bullet lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation.
Moderate elevation of serotonin and an increase in histamine indicate she lived for 5 minutes after the shot.
All other injuries are post-mortem.
Direction of the blood stains on the wall indicate arterial spray.
Leeds tried to fight because intruder moved towards the children's room.
Blood stains on west wall in master bedroom and sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained,
as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leeds' chest.
Also believed post-mortem.
What did the killer do with them after they were dead?
Hi.
This is Valerie Leeds.
I can't speak right now, but if you leave a message after the beep, I'll get right back.
290th floor.
Going up.
When they were dead, he smashed the mirrors and selected pieces for use on Mrs. Leeds.
Killing Mr. Leeds and the children would take less than a minute.
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem 4 or 5 minutes later.
What did he do in the interval?
He smeared blood stains on the wall.
- Hello?
- Molly?
- Will, is that you?
- Yeah, honey.
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
I love you.
- l love you too, baby.
What are you dreaming?
That's something you can't afford for me to know about.
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
lr was maddening to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg, but there wasn't any in the bathroom.
It came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you?
You touched her with your bare hands and then you put your gloves back on!
But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so they could see you?
Hallo?
- Jack, this is Graham.
- ls Price still in Latent Prints?
- Yeah, the Single Print Index.
- What have you got?
- Get him to Atlanta.
- Atlanta P.D.dusted everything and they're good.
- Not as good as Price.
I'll send him tomorrow.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails and the corneas of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves.
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time.
They dusted everything.
The report didn't mention nails.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
Because Mrs Leeds was a beautiful woman.
This is what the subject's teeth look like.
The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed these, from the impressions we took of bite marks off the Leeds woman here, and off the Jacobi woman in Birmingham, last month.
As you can see,he has pegged lateral incisors,that's these teeth here and here.
Vice and narcotics, you take the K-Y cowboys and the leather bars.
Marcus, Whitman heads up at the funeral.
The rest, see the sheet.
One more thing.
I've heard officers reffering this killer as the 'Tooth Fairy'.
Well, I don't wanna hear that in public or see it in inetrnal memoranda!
That's it.
I know a burglar's gonna fence what he stole for cash money.
I know his motive, so I go to work on fences.
This guy, we don't have a motive.
None of us have shit and we know it.
It's in his dreams.
His motive?
- Yeah.
His act fuels his fantasy.
Which is?
- l don't know.
Commissioner says you're the one who got Garrett Jacob Hobbes and then Dr. Lecktor 3 years ago?
- Lecktor killed 9 people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
One is on respirator at a hospital in Baltimore and other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What did psychologist say was wrong with Lektor?
Psychologist call him a 'psychopath'.
They don't know what else to call him.
I understand he cut you pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's.
The kid bought it with a puncture wound in the abdomen.
The Jacobis in Birmingham had a cat.
That's right.
We found the litter box, downstairs but not the cat.
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of washington and cover the backyard,maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
Yeah?
- This is Jimmie Price, fbi.
- Let me put you on the speaker.
- Who am I talking to?
Jimmy, it's Jack Crawford you got Will Graham here.
I got a partial print, probably a thumb.
And a fragment of a palm off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.
Thumb print came off the oldest kid's left eye.
It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.
- Can we make an identification off it?
- Maybe if he's in my index.
I want to work these up in my own darkroom.
I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon.
Thanks Jimmie!
If we get lucky with that print ...
- lf Jimmie can find him in the index.
- Hey, Graham!
Whatta you say?
It's me, Lounds, from the "Tattler".
I did the Lecktor paperback.
When did they call you in?
- l'm buying lunch, alright?
- Give it a rest!
I'm doing my job.
How does he compare to Lecktor?
What does he do to them?
How does he do to them?
How does he do 'em, Will?
- Keep the fuck away from me!
- Will, Will!
Son-of-a-bitch snuck into the hospital while I was sedated and took pictures.
- l know.
- Don't expect too much from me.
We only got three weeks left.
What'd you think I'm just gonna see him standing in the streets, say there he is?
That's Houdini you're thinking about!
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on till we get smart or lucky.
He won't stop.
Why?
- He's got a taste for it.
- You do know something about him.
Not enough.
I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mind set.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court 3 years ago.
I keep getting it for Christmas.
- Did you get my card?
- l got it, thank you.
How is Officer Stuart?
The one who was the first to see my basement.
- Stuart's fine.
- Emotional problems, I hear.
- Do you have any problems, Will?
- No.
No, of course you don't.
I'm glad you came.
My callers are usually psychologists from cornfield universities.
Second-raters, the lot.
- Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction.
- And?
Very interesting, even to a layman.
- l want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
- l thought so.
- lt's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
- Yes?
- You read about it?
- ln the papers, I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing them.
Don't you?
- I thought you might have some ideas?
- Why should I tell you?
You get to see the file in this case.
- And there's another reason.
- Pray tell.
I thought you might be curious, to see if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
Then by implication, you think that you're smater than me, since you caught me?
- No, I know I'm not smart.
- Then how did you catch me?
Your disadvantages.
- What disadvantages?
You're insane.
You're very tanned, Will.
Your hands are rough.
They don't look like cop's hands any more.
And that shaving lotion is something, child desreve.
With a ship on the bottle?
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
I don't think I'll persuade you.
You'll do it or you won't.
Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best.
- Do you have the file with you?
- Yes.
- Pictures?
- Yes.
Let me have them and I'll consider it.
- No.
Dream much, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file and I'll tell you what I think.
This is a very shy boy.
- What were the yards like?
- Big, fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, my dear Will, if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he might outside and look at it.
Ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy for this sort of thing.
That's interesting.
- No,It's not.
You thought of it before.
- l considered it.
You came here to look at me, Will.
- To get the old scent again, didn't you?
- l want your opinion.
- I don't have one right now.
- When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
- Can I keep this?
- Haven't decided.
I'll study them.
When you get more files.
i'll like to see them too.
You can call me,
When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone.
Would you like to give me your home phone number?
No.
Do you know how you caught me?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
Do you know how you caught me?
The reason you caught me, Will, because we're just alike.
You want the scent, smell yourself!
Gotcha!
Get up and face the wall.
Don't turn around, or I'll mace you in the face.
Thank you so much.
I'll call when I'm finished.
- You ready for your call?
- Yes, thank you.
Paltrow, Christiansen and Golub, Law Offices.
I'm sorry, I misdialed.
Thank you for using AT T. This is Operator 24.
Operator, I don't have the use of my arms.
- Would you dial a number for me?
- Certainly.
What's the number?
Area code 3-0-1-5-5-5 6-6-2-4.
University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry.
Dr Sidney Bloom, please.
I'll connect you with his office.
- What's his secretary's name?
- Martha King.
Just a moment.
- Martha King's desk.
- Hi, Martha.
Martha doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob Greer of Blaine Edwards Publishing Company.
Dr. Bloom asked me to send send a copy of 'The psychiatrist and the Law' to someone.
Martha never sent me the address phone number.
She'll be in in the morning.
I've got to catch the Federal express within about five minutes.
I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
I'll bet she has a call caddy next to her phone.
Yeah.
Well, zip that little Pointer right on down to the letter G.
Alright!
The name we're looking for, last name Graham.
The man this book is supposed to send to.
Mr. Will Graham.
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation, 10th and Pennsylvania, Washington D. C.
Now I'll bet his home address is there too.
3680 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida.
Thank you very much.
I've Finished!
- Mommy!
- Oh my gosh!
It's alright.
Stewardess?
You cut the branch so you could see.
Then you passed the time whittling and dreaming.
When night came, you saw them behind bright windows.
You watched the shades go down, saw the lights go out one by one.
And after a while, you climbed down and you went in to them, didn't ya?
Didn't you, son-of-a-bitch?
You watched them allgoddamn day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
I need the Firearms and Toolmarks Section on the severed branch.
I need Bowman to fall on this carving.
- ls it weird?
The mark?
Yeah.
If Documents can't do it, Langley can.
- Did Price get an identification?
No, not yet.
It's a hand search.
Have you seen the "Tattler"?
- lt's not on my preffered reading list.
- Yeah, well, you're all over the front page.
- Who the hell was it, Lounds?
- Who else?
Goddammit, Jack!
I promised Molly.
- Come in!
- Dr. Chilton?
- Yes?
On cleaning out Dr. Lecktor's cell, he hid something in a book.
- We dug around.
- ls that it?
Put it down.
- Has anyone seen this except you?
- No.
- Crawford's office.
- This is Chilton.
Mr. Graham please!
He's not here.
Mr. Crawford is on the line with him now.
Will you tell him this is very, very urgent.
I'll hold on.
Dr. Chilton, it's Crawford.
Graham is on the line, too.
I have two pieces of a note that appears to be from man who killed those people in Atlanta.
- Where did you get it?
- Hidden in a book in Lecktor's cell.
- Don't touch the note.
Read it to us!
- lt's on toilet tissue.
"Dear Dr. Lecktor, I am delighted that you've taken an interest in me.
You alone can understand what I am becoming.
You know the people I used to help me are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.
Just as the source of light is burning.
My collection of your press clippings is as absurd as are mine.
The "Tooth Fairy".
What could be more inappropriate?
Investigator Graham interests me.
Very purposeful-looking.
I hope we can correspond."
There's a piece missing.
I'll read the bottom part.
"After I hear from you, I might send you something wet."
Signed: "Avid fan." There are teeth marks at the bottom.
Sarah, order a chopper, the next thing smoking and I don't care whose.
Two, call Alabama Air National Guard, get Graham back here right now.
Call Documents and scramble a team.
I want everybody moving' five minutes.
The Documents team are on helicopter to pick up the note.
Listen, I wanna replace the note.
I don't want Lecktor to know.
- He might try to warn the killer.
Where's Lecktor now?
- Holding cell.
How long can you keep him in there without him getting suspicious?
Three, four hours
Brian, We have a note coming in, possibly from the Tooth Fairy.
No.1 Priority.
Has to go to Hair and Fiber Latent Prints and Documents.
Graham and I will be walking it through...
One hair.
Maybe half an inch.
- Couple of blue grains.
- Work the hair.
- What do you have as a negative comparison?
- Lecktor's comb.
Whiskers from a razor, hair from the Security Guard.
How many handled this without gloves?
- Guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
- The cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had the oil washed off his fingers.
But the others ...one smudge.
No ridges, it's just the texture of the paper.
- l can fume it but I can't say the iodine stains will fade.
- Ninhydrin?
- Boosted with heat?
- No.
You couldn't wash it out.
I can't get a print in the time.
- How long?
- 20 minutes max.
Main thing is, how was Lecktor supposed to reply?
It's probably in the missing section.
'l hope we can correspond'.
Then comes the gap.
This note was written in ballpoint.
But it looks like Lecktor went over this area with a felt-tip pen and tore it away.
You're so sly, but so am I.
The aniline dyes in the felt-tip pens, like Lecktor used, are transparent to infrared.
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.
This looks like the tip of a T.
This one could be the top of an R.
- Three T's and an R in "Tattler".
The article about me and Lecktor.
No-one else carried that.
Personal ads.
The Tooth Fairy told Lecktor to reply through the Personal ads in the "Tattler".
Chicago is running through them right now.
Here is a line of communication between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor.
If we find Lecktor's answer, we'll replace it with our own.
This is what he'll read:
"Dear Avid Fan:
lnherit my mantle and surpass my achievements.
Mementos for you at Baltimore Central.
Left luggage.
Ticket 7-2-6-8-3."
It's a letter drop.
We stake it out and grab him.
- Anything from Chicago?
- Not yet.
- When do they go to press?
- ln 35 minutes.
- Christ!
- Let's get to the physical.
- There was no print.
- The core size of the hair matches the blond hair found in the Jacobi's.
Your man wrote the note.
Three blue grains went to Brians's end.
Commercial granulated cleanser from the cleaning man.
Particles of dried blood, but not enough to type.
- This is Chester, who's there?
- Will Graham, Jack Crawford.
- Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in it.
- Read it!
"Dear Avid Fan, you honor me.
You're very beautiful.
One hundred prayers for your safety.
Find help in Galatians 6, 11 and 15,2.
Acts 3,3;
Revelations 18,7.
Jonah 6,8;
John 6,22;
Luke 1,7.
Thanks.
Jimmie,
- Get anywhere with the Leeds print?
- Not yet.
- Cryptography at Langley?
- They're working on the telex now.
No.
Our ad has to go out in the same book code, or he'll know.
Book code?
"100 prayers" could be a page number and the paired numbers lines.
Galatians only has six chapters.
Same with Jonah, it only has four.
Lecktor was not using the Bible.
The Tooth Fairy probably named the book in the part torn out.
What about sweating' Lecktor?
We tried sodium amytal 3 years ago, and he gave 'em a recipe for a chip dip.
- Wonderful.
The Tooth Fairy knows which book.
He'd know from articles about Lecktor.
Willingham took Polaroids of Lecktor's cell.
- Have him meet me.
- Where?
- Library of Congress.
25 minutes.
He won't make it.
Lecktor's ad runs as is, or we pull it and run our own ad next week.
- We got 17 days left till full moon!
I don't like Lecktor's ad running without knowing what it says.
It's your call, Will.
Run it.
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something else?
Then we'll all feel sick.
And if Bowman can't figure it out?
- Then we'll bait him with something else in the "Tattler".
- What?
Me.
That's not a very good idea.
- Why not?
Won't it provoke him?
- Maybe, He can be provoked.
I was thinking about as you.
You're getting in deeper and deeper.
Sidney?
The last time you pushed yourself all outta shape.
Try it on again, or if you go through some trauma, you could relapse.
Sidney, don't worry about me.
I'm workin' the evidence, makin' moves, that's all.
I'm fine.
Bowman says it is not books in Lecktor's cell.
- Price?
- lt's a bust out.
The Leeds' print will get us a conviction.
He must never have been printed, because he is not in our index.
We are not gonna identify him off the print.
I'll use Lounds.
What for?
Our boy doesn't read the Times.
He reads Lounds in the "Tattler".
- What else should we cover?
- He put the shorts on Leeds after he was dead, so we wouldn't think he was gay.
He molested all his male victims and may be impotent with women.
Our forensic psychologists have projected that he may have had sexual relations with his mother.
- How long will you stay in Washington?
- Till we've got the Tooth Fairy.
Will the "Tattler" get the stuff?
How's your sex life been affected?
Mine?
It doesn't.
It affects yours!
Fuck yourself!
- Look, pal, you're news!
- You shot the pictures.
- Alright.
I'm in the shots with Graham.
- What?
- Yeah.
Come on!
You want this to look real?
Make sure the theater sign is just out of focus.
- We want him to read it.
- And make sure I look excellent!
Shoot it!
One more.
- One more.
- That's enough.
OK, Graham.
Always nice, huh?
Let's have lunch, call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.
- Dr. Bloom.
I need them on my desk in 2 hours.
- OK.
- Did Bowman break the code yet?
- No.
They say the cutting tool was a common bolt cutter.
I got a call from Asian Studies in Langley.
The mark on the tree is a Chinese lucky sign in gambling.
The same character appears in Mah-jongg.
It means Red Dragon.
Mean anything to you?
No.
If he shows and he's smart, he'll approach from the front, pass, turn and try and take you from behind.
How's your hearing?
- Good.
You'll wear a wire, one way.
We'll hear you, but you won't hear us.
Checked out a 44 Special Bulldog?
Load these in it.
- You ever fire 'em?
- Glaser safety slugs?
Number 12 shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing.
Opens up on impact.
Guaranteed one shot stop.
- You got body armor?
- Kevlar Second Chance.
- Hope you get one.
- Cause he goes for the head shot?
Let's walk the route.
United Flight 8490 to Newark now boarding at gate 7.
United Flight 8490 to Newark now boarding at gate 7.
Someone's coming.
Go!
Don't!
Don't move!
Take the money!
Don't shoot!
Clear!
Quicker, man!
I'm being mugged!
- Do you know who I am?
- l don't wanna know who you are.
You said I'm a sexual pervert.
'An animal' you said.
Do you know who I am now?
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Open your eyes!
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.
That's why you're here.
Open your eyes or I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Well, here I ... am.
Look at the screen.
William Blake's
'The Great Red Dragon' and 'The Woman Clothed in the Rays of the Sun'.
- Do you see?
- Yes.
- Mrs. Leeds.
Do you see?
- Yes.
- Mrs. Jacobi.
Do you see?
- Yes.
- The next family as they will look.
Do you see?
- Yes.
Mrs. Leeds, later.
Her husband beside her.
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.
The Dragon rampant.
Freddie Lounds.
Your photograph.
- No!
- No what?
- Not me, please!
- Please!
- Are you a man?
- Yes.
- Do you imply that I'm queer?
- God, no!
Before me you are a slug in the sun.
You are privy to a great becoming and you recognise nothing!
You are an ant in the afterbirth!
It is your nature to do one thing correctly... tremble.
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, Lounds, you and the others owe me awe!
One more piece of work to do.
If he takes off the mask, I'm dead now!
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!
Read this into the tape recorder.
Go.
"l have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the Red Dragon.
All I wrote about him were lies.
Will Graham made me write them to pull him into a trap.
Will Graham, you will learn how much you have to dread, because I lied.
He will be more merciful to me.
You will lie awake in fear of what the Red Dragon will do.
I will testify to the truth of this."
You did very well.
Will you let me go now?
Please?
- You will tell the truth?
- l promise.
Good.
We'll seal your promise with ...
We'll seal your promise
with a kiss.
Only five answers are possible.
Any member of a team may buzz in and answer.
Bowman, skip the cryptography and tell me what it says!
- Did he try to say anything at all?
- No.
- He never regained consciousness.
Did you hear the tape?
- Yes.
Listen,
Bowman just broke Lecktor's code in the personal ad.
- lt's the State of Maryland Statutes.
You need to know, now.
- What?
Listen to me.
Everything's okay.
I've taken care of it.
What is it, Jack?
The bastard gave him your address.
It said: "Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida."
Save yourself.
Kill them all.
- Get me a plane!
- Will!
Will!
Mom?
Huh?
What?
Someone's outside.
- l hear noises.
- Where?
- Outside.
Go back to your room and close the door.
- Mom?
- Do it, now!
- Mom, are you alright?
- What?
What is it?
What is it?
What's going on?
Come back inside!
- What's going on?
- Come inside!
- So what ...?
- Come back inside!
I'm sorry, Molly.
I'm sorry about all of this.
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.
- He's after you now, isn't he?
- lt's just a precaution.
Kevin?
Run down to the water and check the out dock.
I wanna hang around here.
I'm in the kitchen, mom.
What's that about?
He's afraid to leave you alone with me now?
He saw the article in the "Tattler".
I wanted to talk to him, but he said he'd bring it up with you.
Good for him.
Kevin, help me unpack and then we'll get some groceries.
You and mom are well protected.
No one's gonna find you.
is there anything I need to know, to see about mom?
No.
- This guy's planning to kill us?
- We don't know that.
When you gonna kill him?
I'm not.
It's only my job to find him.
In the newspaper it said you were in a special hospital.
Well, it was a regular hospital, then I was transferred to the psychiatric wing.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
I don't know.
Was it because of this man Lecktor?
What happened?
Lecktor attacked college girls and he killed them.
How?
In bad ways.
He was a psychiatrist.
One of the girls was his patient and I went to talk to him about her.
I tried to build up feelings like the killer had, so I would know why he did it 'cause that would help me find him.
I was sitting in Lecktor's office and saw a book on a shelf with pictures of war wounds.
And I knew it was him.
So I went to a pay phone to call the police.
That's when he attacked me.
You and mom ... came to see me in hospital and that helped a lot.
But after my body got OK, I still had his thoughts in my head.
I stopped talking to people.
A doctor friend, Dr. Bloom asked me to get help, and I did.
And after a while I felt better and I was OK again.
And the way you thought ...
felt that bad?
Kevin, the ugliest thoughts in the world.
What kind of coffee you like?
What?
- You like that Folger's stuff, right?
- Yeah.
Mom too.
- When can we go home, Dad?
- l don't know, Kevin.
So where are things?
Nowhere.
Everything we've tried is a dead end or has backfired.
Crawford is planning the next crime scene.
- Six days till full moon.
- Can you quit?
No.
What's next?
- l go to Atlanta.
- Crawford?
No.
I have to be alone.
- You're talking about doing exactly what ...
- This killing it's gotta stop!
William, you're going to make yourself sick, or get killed.
You and Kevin should go to Montana, see your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.
I'll come and get you afterwards.
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
I'm sorry I can't come to the phone.
- l'm sorry too.
- Excuse me?
- Coffee.
Just you and me now, sport.
I'm gonna find you, Goddammit!
- Mr. Dollarhyde?
- Oh, Eileen.
- Bill says there's a variation in the gamma number 3, but he caught it in time.
Good.
Good.
- Who's there?
- Mr. Dollarhyde.
- l came about the infrared emulsion.
- Come in.
It's safe.
Put your back against the door.
Stool to the right.
You're the production controller?
- What are the conditions?
- Shooting from 8 feet.
- l can't use any lights.
- What's being photographed?
- Nocturnal animals.
- When do you need it?
- ln four days.
- OK. I'll stick this in a black bag.
- 1000 C infrared, sensitive has to be handled in total darkness.
Remember to be careful.
It's easier than the 1200 series.
- Fine. - ln case you're wondering, I keep the samples by touch.
I was wondering ... I gotta fly.
Perhaps Mr. Dollarhyde can drive you home.
No, that's OK.
No thanks.
Go on.
- l'll take you.
- No thanks.
- l'll order 1200ft of 1000 C tomorrow.
- Ride with me!
- No thanks!
I'll take the bus.
Ride with me!
I would like you to.
OK, sure.
I'll just get my stuff on.
How did you come to Gateway?
They had to hire the handicapped to get this Defense contract.
- You worked out well.
Everybody they hired did.
You speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants.
I trained in therapy for speech and hearing-impaired children.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
If you don't wanna talk, that's OK.
You're very direct, I like that.
I like what you have to say.
May I touch your face?
Are you smiling or frowning?
I guess I wanna know whether I should be quiet or not.
Take my word for it,
- l'm smiling.
- l didn't mean to offend you.
- Can I take you somewhere?
- Where?
It will be my surprise.
OK.
Sure.
- Are you apprehensive?
- No.
- The protective Mr. Dollarhyde is watching us. - l want to!
In about two hours we're going to cap his tooth.
It's warm.
There ...
Hear it?
You ... rearrange the dead families into an audience.
You think what you do makes you into something different.
You're becoming ...
What is it you're becoming?
The answer is in the way you use the mirrors.
What do the mirrors make you dream?
A little to your left.
Francis, that was a great dinner.
There's a gin and tonic, right in front of you.
What are you watching?
A little homework.
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, D.
Your heart's loud if you love me.
is that you, D.?
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- lf you show me, I'll make us some coffee
- No!
- Don't go back inside the house.
- l left my purse inside.
I'll get it, it's OK.
I mean, you should stay outside.
You look so good in the sun.
When ...
Reba, when can I see you again?
We could meet at my house.
You got the message Lecktor called?
Yeah.
L'll call him in a few minutes.
We identified the tire tracks when Lounds was delivered to the "Tattler".
G-7816, Goodyear truck tires.
Our boy drives a van.
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you back?
When I'm done, Jack.
Will Graham of the fbi.
I'd like to talk to Dr. Lecktor.
Hello?
Hello, Will.
Congratulations on the job you did on Mr. Lounds.
I admired it.
What a cunning boy you are.
I'm sick of you, Lecktor.
You've got something to say, say it!
I want to help you.
Relax with yourself!
We don't invent our natures, they're issued to us with our lungs and pancreas and everything else.
Why fight it?
Fight what?
Did you really feel depressed after you shot Hobbes to death?
I think you probably did.
But it wasn't the act that got to you.
Didn't you feel so bad, because killing him felt so good.
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.
God's terrific.
He dropped a church roof on 34 worshippers last Wednesday, while groveling through a hymn.
Don't you think that felt good?
Why does it feel good, Dr. Lecktor?
It feels good, because God has power.
If one does what God does, enough times, one will become as God is.
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.
He got 140 Phillipinos in one plane crash last year.
Remember that earthquake in Italy last spring?
I enter.
The glass cutter.
The piece of glass is mine.
The house is mine.
I walk up these stairs, I pass the children's toys.
The children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.
I moved to the door.
I step into the room.
I see you there.
I see me desired by you.
Accepted and loved.
In the silver mirrors of your eyes.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
OK.
Wait a minute.
- What was it?
- Pollen.
- Oh, Thanks for the ride.
- See you tomorrow.
Mr. Dollarhyde.
What are you doing here?
- Who is it?
- lt's me.
- Hallo?
Who is it?
- lt's me.
- Francis?
- No.
Not Francis.
Francis is gone.
Francis is gone, forever.
So what do we do?
The dream.
He dreams about being desired.
So he changes people into beings who want and desire him.
- Changes?
- lt's a word.
Killing and arranging the people to imitate it.
Lecktor told me something.
If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
You put it together, our boy imitates being wanted and desired enough times, he believes he'll become one who is wanted and desired.
It'll all come true.
It started from abused kid.
Battered infant.
- There is something terrible about...
- Are you sympathising?
Absolutley, my heart bleeds for him as a child.
Someone took the kid and manufactured the monster, as the same time as an adult, he is irredeemable.
He butchers whole families to pursue trivial fantasies.
As an adult, someone should blow the sick fuck out of his socks .
Do you thing that's a contradiction, Jack?
Does this kind of understanding make you uncomfortable?
What about the mirrors?
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.
But he doesn't take anything.
He needs souvenirs from the houses, so he can relive the event.
Maybe he records it somehow.
So he can see himself accepted over and over and over again.
- VTR's, Polaroids, stills, what?
- How do I know?
How does he find them?
If we find out how he found them, we'll find him.
There is no connection between the two familes,
- we've done a dozen computer work.
- Jack!
All the women have a bloom on them.
He picked these women!
There's selection and design here.
- Look, admit we struck out this month.
The Lear Jet is standing by the basic lab stuff is on it.
You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, the photographer.
Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and 15 minutes!
We get the call, we roll!
- This thing'll be fresh!
- lt's not over yet.
For Christ sake it's a foregone conclusion.
It's 11.30pm. The full moon is happening tonight.
Give it up!
It's too damn late!
- l gave it up.
Till you showed up with pictures of two dead families!
Fuckin' right!
I did it, I'd do it again!
Great, but don't talk to me about late, pal!
I'll tell you when it's too fucking late!
until then we go as late as I wanna take it.
A padlock.
That's why the bolt cutter.
What's that?
He used a boltcutter to trim away branch when he was watching from the woods.
Why didn't he use the bolt cutter on the garage door?
Because a deadbolt was there when they were killed.
Donald Jacobis birthday party was April 14th.
Sometime between April and August they changed the lock, but he thought there was a padlock.
From the street you can't see the glass on the Leeds' kitchen door.
There's a big, high fence there, but he was ready with his glass cutter.
Either he was casing far ahead, and we didn't check back far enough, or ...
We checked.
Metcalf, it's Graham.
Ls the Leeds and Jacobi stuff still there?
Have the guard down there call me.
Do it!
You know that's the Jacobi's cat.
He brought a bolt cutter, because he thought there was a padlock.
Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar, but you know it's their dog.
You see the woman?
The bloom on the woman?
You can see her again and again, anytime you want.
Doggie doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog ... and the Jacobi cat ... and the padlock on the door.
You know you need a bolt cutter and every other goddamn thing.
Because everything with you is seeing isn't?
Your primary sensory intake that makies your dream live is seeing.
The reflections... mirrors ... images ...
You've seen these films!
Haven't you, my man?
The guard in the storeroom.
- The cans!
- What cans?
- The tapes were transferred from home,
Where's the packaging of the films came?
There are films of the families in document storage, find them.
You got 'em?
Are there any labels?
Leeds can, Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
The Jacobi label says the same thing:
Gateway Lab, St. Louis.
Who processed the Jacobi film?
No, Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.
Stores send 'em out.
Have him peel the top label back.
is there a label underneath?
It does, doesn't it?
I want a chopper in three minutes to Meigs Field.
At Meigs Field I want the Lear Jet prepped for St. Louis.
Where are you?
Are you here?
You're scaring me!
Stop it!
Francis, why are you doing this to me?
It's ugly.
Are you in this room?
Where are you?
You answer me!
We're looking for a man.
We know he works at Gateway.
We don't have his name, but we know he drives a van.
I got special stickers for vans.
I got 28 van permits here.
- Start feeding me names.
is this Lieutenant Fisk?
Will Graham.
I need you to get the driver's licenses of these names.
The man we're looking for is blond, Caucasian, 20-40 years old, over six feet tall, 180-225 pounds.
First name?
A-L-V-A-R-O.
First name Joseph.
A-L-V-A-R-O, first name Joseph.

Fast!
Buckle up.
We're landing in Lambert Field.
Fogel has four more names.
Two have dark hair.
Third's a woman.
Fourth is a handicapped permit.
This is our man.
Rural Route 3, Chester, Missouri.
Where is that?
We're 10.25 at the Hock Road offramp, Highway 904.
Let's go!
- Meeting point's up ahead.
- Go on to the house.
- Lieutenant Fisk said ...
- Go on to the house!
Will?
Will, you won't need that.
The Swat Team will take him down, not us.
Will?
- This ought to be it.
- Kill your lights!
- Alright?
- l'm OK.
Griffin's hurt bad.
I'll wait for the backup.
Set up a road block on Route 3!
We're in the trees west of the house.
How far away's the backup?
I'm goin' around the back, stay here.
He's in there, Jack.
Someone is with him.
What?
Will, what did you say?
Wait for the back-up!
He's got someone with him, Jack.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Who are you?
Graham.
I'm Will Graham.
Looks worse, than it is.
See the turtles?
It was on the news.
I thought I'd work things out ... and call you after.
I thought I wouldn't wait.
How many of them made it?
Most of 'em. (Subtitles By Sooraj)
We should have talked to the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk here.
I'm not falling over to talk about it much anywhere, Jack.
- How much do you know?
- Not much.
The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago, and Atlanta was all over TV.
- Did you think about giving me a call?
- No.
- Why not?
I quit, remember?
You look alright now.
I am alright.
If you can't look anymore, I understand.
Don't play games with me!
If I really didn't need you, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks till full moon.
We have a better chance if you help me.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
- Think it'll keep them out, Dad?
- Yep.
- How many turtle's eggs are in here?
- In this hatchery?
40 or 50 of 'em.
- Crabs get most of them, huh?
- Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it.
What about the dogs?
No.
That's why we buried the wire down in the sand.
I need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be his friend.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, Molly,
I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.
- We've got it pretty good.
- More than good.
All that happened before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only look at the evidence.
I wouldn't get involved.
He'd never even see me.
If they find him, they'll have to take him down.
What do you think?
You've already decided and you're not really asking.
If I were asking?
Stay here with me.
Me and Kevin.
That's selfish and I know it.
I'll come inside with you and show you around.
- Mr. Crawford said maybe you want to be alone.
- That's right.
There's a VCR in your hotel room.
There's home movies of both families on half inch VHS.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen door.
Used a glass cutter on a suction cup.
Entry was skilful.
All prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair, strong.
Size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood AB positive, from saliva on glass from the suction cup.
Why did he leave saliva on the glass?
It was hot that night, so it must have felt cool in the house.
Intruder cut Charles Leeds's throat then shot Mrs. Leeds.
Bullet lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation.
Moderate elevation of serotonin and an increase in histamine indicate she lived for 5 minutes after the shot.
All other injuries are post-mortem.
Direction of the blood stains on the wall indicate arterial spray.
Leeds tried to fight because intruder moved towards the children's room.
Blood stains on west wall in master bedroom and sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained,
as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leeds' chest.
Also believed post-mortem.
What did the killer do with them after they were dead?
Hi.
This is Valerie Leeds.
I can't speak right now, but if you leave a message after the beep, I'll get right back.
29th floor.
Going up.
When they were dead, he smashed the mirrors and selected pieces for use on Mrs. Leeds.
Killing Mr. Leeds and the children would take less than a minute.
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem 4 or 5 minutes later.
What did he do in the interval?
He smeared blood stains on the wall.
- Hello?
- Molly?
- Will, is that you?
- Yeah, honey.
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
I love you.
- I love you too, baby.
What are you dreaming?
That's something you can't afford for me to know about.
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
It was maddening to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg, but there wasn't any in the bathroom.
It came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you?
You touched her with your bare hands and then you put your gloves back on!
But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so they could see you?
Hallo?
- Jack, this is Graham.
- Is Price still in Latent Prints?
- Yeah, the Single Print Index.
- What have you got?
- Get him to Atlanta.
- Atlanta P.D.dusted everything and they're good.
- Not as good as Price.
I'll send him tomorrow.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails and the corneas of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves.
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time.
They dusted everything.
The report didn't mention nails.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
Because Mrs Leeds was a beautiful woman.
This is what the subject's teeth look like.
The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed these, from the impressions we took of bite marks off the Leeds woman here, and off the Jacobi woman in Birmingham, last month.
As you can see,he has pegged lateral incisors,that's these teeth here and here.
Vice and narcotics, you take the K
- Y cowboys and the leather bars.
Marcus, Whitman heads up at the funeral.
The rest, see the sheet.
One more thing.
I've heard officers reffering this killer as the 'Tooth Fairy'.
Well, I don't wanna hear that in public or see it in inetrnal memoranda!
That's it.
I know a burglar's gonna fence what he stole for cash money.
I know his motive, so I go to work on fences.
This guy, we don't have a motive.
None of us have shit and we know it.
It's in his dreams.
His motive?
- Yeah.
His act fuels his fantasy.
Which is?
- I don't know.
Commissioner says you're the one who got Garrett Jacob Hobbes and then Dr. Lecktor 3 years ago?
- Lecktor killed 9 people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
One is on respirator at a hospital in Baltimore and other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What did psychologist say was wrong with Lektor?
Psychologist call him a 'psychopath'.
They don't know what else to call him.
I understand he cut you pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's.
The kid bought it with a puncture wound in the abdomen.
The Jacobis in Birmingham had a cat.
That's right.
We found the litter box, downstairs but not the cat.
Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of washington and cover the backyard,maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
Yeah?
- This is Jimmie Price, fbi.
- Let me put you on the speaker.
- Who am I talking to?
Jimmy, it's Jack Crawford you got Will Graham here.
I got a partial print, probably a thumb.
And a fragment of a palm off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.
Thumb print came off the oldest kid's left eye.
It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.
- Can we make an identification off it?
- Maybe if he's in my index.
I want to work these up in my own darkroom.
I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon.
Thanks Jimmie!
If we get lucky with that print...
- If Jimmie can find him in the index.
- Hey, Graham!
Whatta you say?
It's me, Lounds, from the "Tattler".
I did the Lecktor paperback.
When did they call you in?
- I'm buying lunch, alright?
- Give it a rest!
I'm doing my job.
How does he compare to Lecktor?
What does he do to them?
How does he do to them?
How does he do 'em, Will?
- Keep the fuck away from me!
- Will, Will!
Son-of-a-bitch snuck into the hospital while I was sedated and took pictures.
- I know.
- Don't expect too much from me.
We only got three weeks left.
What'd you think I'm just gonna see him standing in the streets, say there he is?
That's Houdini you're thinking about!
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on till we get smart or lucky.
He won't stop.
Why?
- He's got a taste for it.
- You do know something about him.
Not enough.
I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mind set.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court 3 years ago.
I keep getting it for Christmas.
- Did you get my card?
- I got it, thank you.
How is Officer Stuart?
The one who was the first to see my basement.
- Stuart's fine.
- Emotional problems, I hear.
- Do you have any problems, Will?
- No.
No, of course you don't.
I'm glad you came.
My callers are usually psychologists from cornfield universities.
Second-raters, the lot.
- Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction.
- And?
Very interesting, even to a layman.
- I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
- I thought so.
- It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
- Yes?
- You read about it?
- In the papers, I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing them.
Don't you?
- I thought you might have some ideas?
- Why should I tell you?
You get to see the file in this case.
- And there's another reason.
- Pray tell.
I thought you might be curious, to see if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
Then by implication, you think that you're smater than me, since you caught me?
- No, I know I'm not smart.
- Then how did you catch me?
Your disadvantages.
- What disadvantages?
You're insane.
You're very tanned, Will.
Your hands are rough.
They don't look like cop's hands any more.
And that shaving lotion is something, child desreve.
With a ship on the bottle?
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
I don't think I'll persuade you.
You'll do it or you won't.
Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best.
- Do you have the file with you?
- Yes.
- Pictures?
- Yes.
Let me have them and I'll consider it.
- No.
Dream much, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file and I'll tell you what I think.
This is a very shy boy.
- What were the yards like?
- Big, fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, my dear Will, if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he might go outside and look at it.
Ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy for this sort of thing.
That's interesting.
- No, it's not.
You thought of it before.
- I considered it.
You came here to look at me, Will.
- To get the old scent again, didn't you?
- I want your opinion.
- I don't have one right now.
- When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
- Can I keep this?
- Haven't decided.
I'll study them.
When you get more files.
i'll like to see them too.
You can call me,
When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone.
Would you like to give me your home phone number?
No.
Do you know how you caught me?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
Do you know how you caught me?
The reason you caught me, Will, because we're just alike.
You want the scent, smell yourself!
Gotcha!
Get up and face the wall.
Don't turn around, or I'll mace you in the face.
Thank you so much.
I'll call when I'm finished.
- You ready for your call?
- Yes, thank you.
Paltrow, Christiansen and Golub, Law Offices.
I'm sorry, I misdialed.
Thank you for using AT T. This is Operator 24.
Operator, I don't have the use of my arms.
- Would you dial a number for me?
- Certainly.
What's the number?
Area code 3-0-1-5-5-5 6-6-2-4.
University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry.
Dr Sidney Bloom, please.
I'll connect you with his office.
- What's his secretary's name?
- Martha King.
Just a moment.
- Martha King's desk.
- Hi, Martha.
Martha doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob Greer of Blaine Edwards Publishing Company.
Dr. Bloom asked me to send send a copy of 'The psychiatrist and the Law' to someone.
Martha never sent me the address phone number.
She'll be in in the morning.
I've got to catch the Federal express within about five minutes.
I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
I'll bet she has a call caddy next to her phone.
Yeah.
Well, zip that little Pointer right on down to the letter G.
Alright!
The name we're looking for, last name Graham.
The man this book is supposed to send to.
Mr. Will Graham.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, 10th and Pennsylvania, Washington D. C.
Now I'll bet his home address is there too.
3680 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida.
Thank you very much.
I've Finished!
- Mommy!
- Oh my gosh!
It's alright.
Stewardess?
You cut the branch so you could see.
Then you passed the time whittling and dreaming.
When night came, you saw them behind bright windows.
You watched the shades go down, saw the lights go out one by one.
And after a while, you climbed down and you went in to them, didn't ya?
Didn't you, son-of-a-bitch?
You watched them allgoddamn day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
I need the Firearms and Toolmarks Section on the severed branch.
I need Bowman to fall on this carving.
- Is it weird?
The mark?
Yeah.
If Documents can't do it, Langley can.
- Did Price get an identification?
No, not yet.
It's a hand search.
Have you seen the "Tattler"?
- It's not on my preffered reading list.
- Yeah, well, you're all over the front page.
- Who the hell was it, Lounds?
- Who else?
Goddammit, Jack!
I promised Molly.
- Come in!
- Dr. Chilton?
- Yes?
On cleaning out Dr. Lecktor's cell, he hid something in a book.
- We dug around.
- Is that it?
Put it down.
- Has anyone seen this except you?
- No.
- Crawford's office.
- This is Chilton.
Mr. Graham please!
He's not here.
Mr. Crawford is on the line with him now.
Will you tell him this is very, very urgent.
I'll hold on.
Dr. Chilton, it's Crawford.
Graham is on the line, too.
I have two pieces of a note that appears to be from man who killed those people in Atlanta.
- Where did you get it?
- Hidden in a book in Lecktor's cell.
- Don't touch the note.
Read it to us!
- It's on toilet tissue.
"Dear Dr. Lecktor,
I am delighted that you've taken an interest in me.
You alone can understand what I am becoming.
You know the people I used to help me are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.
Just as the source of light is burning.
My collection of your press clippings is as absurd as are mine.
The "Tooth Fairy".
What could be more inappropriate?
Investigator Graham interests me.
Very purposeful-looking.
I hope we can correspond. "
There's a piece missing.
I'll read the bottom part.
"After I hear from you, I might send you something wet. "
Signed: "Avid fan. " There are teeth marks at the bottom.
Sarah, order a chopper, the next thing smoking and I don't care whose.
Two, call Alabama Air National Guard, get Graham back here right now.
Call Documents and scramble a team.
I want everybody moving' five minutes.
The Documents team are on helicopter to pick up the note.
Listen, I wanna replace the note.
I don't want Lecktor to know.
- He might try to warn the killer.
Where's Lecktor now?
- Holding cell.
How long can you keep him in there without him getting suspicious?
Three, four hours
Brian, We have a note coming in, possibly from the Tooth Fairy.
No. 1 Priority.
Has to go to Hair and Fiber Latent Prints and Documents.
Graham and I will be walking it through...
One hair.
Maybe half an inch.
- Couple of blue grains.
- Work the hair.
- What do you have as a negative comparison?
- Lecktor's comb.
Whiskers from a razor, hair from the Security Guard.
How many handled this without gloves?
- Guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
- The cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had the oil washed off his fingers.
But the others... one smudge.
No ridges, it's just the texture of the paper.
- I can fume it but I can't say the iodine stains will fade.
- Ninhydrin?
- Boosted with heat?
- No.
You couldn't wash it out.
I can't get a print in the time.
- How long?
- 20 minutes max.
Main thing is, how was Lecktor supposed to reply?
It's probably in the missing section.
'I hope we can correspond'.
Then comes the gap.
This note was written in ballpoint.
But it looks like Lecktor went over this area with a felt-tip pen and tore it away.
You're so sly, but so am I.
The aniline dyes in the felt-tip pens, like Lecktor used, are transparent to infrared.
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.
This looks like the tip of a T.
This one could be the top of an R.
- Three T's and an R in "Tattler".
The article about me and Lecktor.
No-one else carried that.
Personal ads.
The Tooth Fairy told Lecktor to reply through the Personal ads in the "Tattler".
Chicago is running through them right now.
Here is a line of communication between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor.
If we find Lecktor's answer, we'll replace it with our own.
This is what he'll read:
"Dear Avid Fan:
Inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements.
Mementos for you at Baltimore Central.
Left luggage.
Ticket 7-2-6-8-3."
It's a letter drop.
We stake it out and grab him.
- Anything from Chicago?
- Not yet.
- When do they go to press?
- In 35 minutes.
- Christ!
- Let's get to the physical.
- There was no print.
- The core size of the hair matches the blond hair found in the Jacobi's.
Your man wrote the note.
Three blue grains went to Brians's end.
Commercial granulated cleanser from the cleaning man.
Particles of dried blood, but not enough to type.
- This is Chester, who's there?
- Will Graham, Jack Crawford.
- Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in it.
- Read it!
"Dear Avid Fan, you honor me.
You're very beautiful.
One hundred prayers for your safety.
Find help in Galatians 6, 11 and 15,2.
Acts 3,3;
Revelations 18,7.
Jonah 6,8;
John 6,22;
Luke 1,7.
Thanks.
Jimmie,
- Get anywhere with the Leeds print?
- Not yet.
- Cryptography at Langley?
- They're working on the telex now.
No.
Our ad has to go out in the same book code, or he'll know.
Book code?
"100 prayers" could be a page number and the paired numbers lines.
Galatians only has six chapters.
Same with Jonah, it only has four.
Lecktor was not using the Bible.
The Tooth Fairy probably named the book in the part torn out.
What about sweating' Lecktor?
We tried sodium amytal 3 years ago, and he gave 'em a recipe for a chip dip.
- Wonderful.
The Tooth Fairy knows which book.
He'd know from articles about Lecktor.
Willingham took Polaroids of Lecktor's cell.
- Have him meet me.
- Where?
- Library of Congress.
25 minutes.
He won't make it.
Lecktor's ad runs as is, or we pull it and run our own ad next week.
- We got 17 days left till full moon!
I don't like Lecktor's ad running without knowing what it says.
It's your call, Will.
Run it.
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something else?
Then we'll all feel sick.
And if Bowman can't figure it out?
- Then we'll bait him with something else in the "Tattler".
- What?
Me.
That's not a very good idea.
- Why not?
Won't it provoke him?
- Maybe, He can be provoked.
I was thinking about as you.
You're getting in deeper and deeper.
Sidney?
The last time you pushed yourself all outta shape.
Try it on again, or if you go through some trauma, you could relapse.
Sidney, don't worry about me.
I'm workin' the evidence, makin' moves, that's all.
I'm fine.
Bowman says it is not books in Lecktor's cell.
- Price?
- It's a bust out.
The Leeds' print will get us a conviction.
He must never have been printed, because he is not in our index.
We are not gonna identify him off the print.
I'll use Lounds.
What for?
Our boy doesn't read the Times.
He reads Lounds in the "Tattler".
- What else should we cover?
- He put the shorts on Leeds after he was dead, so we wouldn't think he was gay.
He molested all his male victims and may be impotent with women.
Our forensic psychologists have projected that he may have had sexual relations with his mother.
- How long will you stay in Washington?
- Till we've got the Tooth Fairy.
Will the "Tattler" get the stuff?
How's your sex life been affected?
Mine?
It doesn't.
It affects yours!
Fuck yourself!
- Look, pal, you're news!
- You shot the pictures.
- Alright.
I'm in the shots with Graham.
- What?
- Yeah.
Come on!
You want this to look real?
Make sure the theater sign is just out of focus.
- We want him to read it.
- And make sure I look excellent!
Shoot it!
One more.
- One more.
- That's enough.
OK, Graham.
Always nice, huh?
Let's have lunch, call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.
- Dr. Bloom.
I need them on my desk in 2 hours.
- OK.
- Did Bowman break the code yet?
- No.
They say the cutting tool was a common bolt cutter.
I got a call from Asian Studies in Langley.
The mark on the tree is a Chinese lucky sign in gambling.
The same character appears in Mah-jongg.
It means Red Dragon.
Mean anything to you?
No.
If he shows and he's smart, he'll approach from the front, pass, turn and try and take you from behind.
How's your hearing?
- Good.
You'll wear a wire, one way.
We'll hear you, but you won't hear us.
Checked out a 44 Special Bulldog?
Load these in it.
- You ever fire 'em?
- Glaser safety slugs?
Number 12 shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing.
Opens up on impact.
Guaranteed one shot stop.
- You got body armor?
- Kevlar Second Chance.
- Hope you get one.
- Cause he goes for the head shot?
Let's walk the route.
United Flight 8490 to Newark now boarding at gate 7.
United Flight 8490 to Newark now boarding at gate 7.
Someone's coming.
Go!
Don't!
Don't move!
Take the money!
Don't shoot!
Clear!
Quicker, man!
I'm being mugged!
- Do you know who I am?
- I don't wanna know who you are.
You said I'm a sexual pervert.
'An animal' you said.
Do you know who I am now?
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Open your eyes!
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.
That's why you're here.
Open your eyes or I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Well, here I... am.
Look at the screen.
William Blake's
'The Great Red Dragon' and 'The Woman Clothed in the Rays of the Sun'.
- Do you see?
- Yes.
- Mrs. Leeds.
Do you see?
- Yes.
- Mrs. Jacobi.
Do you see?
- Yes.
- The next family as they will look.
Do you see?
- Yes.
Mrs. Leeds, later.
Her husband beside her.
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.
The Dragon rampant.
Freddie Lounds.
Your photograph.
- No!
- No what?
- Not me, please!
- Please!
- Are you a man?
- Yes.
- Do you imply that I'm queer?
- God, no!
Before me you are a slug in the sun.
You are privy to a great becoming and you recognise nothing!
You are an ant in the afterbirth!
It is your nature to do one thing correctly... tremble.
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, Lounds, you and the others owe me awe!
One more piece of work to do.
If he takes off the mask, I'm dead now!
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!
Read this into the tape recorder.
Go.
"I have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the Red Dragon.
All I wrote about him were lies.
Will Graham made me write them to pull him into a trap.
Will Graham, you will learn how much you have to dread, because I lied.
He will be more merciful to me.
You will lie awake in fear of what the Red Dragon will do.
I will testify to the truth of this. "
You did very well.
Will you let me go now?
Please?
- You will tell the truth?
- I promise.
Good.
We'll seal your promise with...
We'll seal your promise
with a kiss.
Only five answers are possible.
Any member of a team may buzz in and answer.
Bowman, skip the cryptography and tell me what it says!
- Did he try to say anything at all?
- No.
- He never regained consciousness.
Did you hear the tape?
- Yes.
Listen,
Bowman just broke Lecktor's code in the personal ad.
- It's the State of Maryland Statutes.
You need to know, now.
- What?
Listen to me.
Everything's okay.
I've taken care of it.
What is it, Jack?
The bastard gave him your address.
It said: "Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida. "
Save yourself.
Kill them all.
- Get me a plane!
- Will!
Will!
Mom?
Huh?
What?
Someone's outside.
- I hear noises.
- Where?
- Outside.
Go back to your room and close the door.
- Mom?
- Do it, now!
- Mom, are you alright?
- What?
What is it?
What is it?
What's going on?
Come back inside!
- What's going on?
- Come inside!
- So what...?
- Come back inside!
I'm sorry, Molly.
I'm sorry about all of this.
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.
- He's after you now, isn't he?
- It's just a precaution.
Kevin?
Run down to the water and check the out dock.
I wanna hang around here.
I'm in the kitchen, mom.
What's that about?
He's afraid to leave you alone with me now?
He saw the article in the "Tattler".
I wanted to talk to him, but he said he'd bring it up with you.
Good for him.
Kevin, help me unpack and then we'll get some groceries.
You and mom are well protected.
No one's gonna find you.
Is there anything I need to know, to see about mom?
No.
- This guy's planning to kill us?
- We don't know that.
When you gonna kill him?
I'm not.
It's only my job to find him.
In the newspaper it said you were in a special hospital.
Well, it was a regular hospital, then I was transferred to the psychiatric wing.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
I don't know.
Was it because of this man Lecktor?
What happened?
Lecktor attacked college girls and he killed them.
How?
In bad ways.
He was a psychiatrist.
One of the girls was his patient and I went to talk to him about her.
I tried to build up feelings like the killer had, so I would know why he did it 'cause that would help me find him.
I was sitting in Lecktor's office and saw a book on a shelf with pictures of war wounds.
And I knew it was him.
So I went to a pay phone to call the police.
That's when he attacked me.
You and mom... came to see me in hospital and that helped a lot.
But after my body got OK,
I still had his thoughts in my head.
I stopped talking to people.
A doctor friend, Dr. Bloom asked me to get help, and I did.
And after a while I felt better and I was OK again.
And the way you thought...
felt that bad?
Kevin, the ugliest thoughts in the world.
What kind of coffee you like?
What?
- You like that Folger's stuff, right?
- Yeah.
Mom too.
- When can we go home, Dad?
- I don't know, Kevin.
So where are things?
Nowhere.
Everything we've tried is a dead end or has backfired.
Crawford is planning the next crime scene.
- Six days till full moon.
- Can you quit?
No.
What's next?
- I go to Atlanta.
- Crawford?
No.
I have to be alone.
- You're talking about doing exactly what...
- This killing it's gotta stop!
William, you're going to make yourself sick, or get killed.
You and Kevin should go to Montana, see your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.
I'll come and get you afterwards.
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
I'm sorry I can't come to the phone.
- I'm sorry too.
- Excuse me?
- Coffee.
Just you and me now, sport.
I'm gonna find you, Goddammit!
- Mr. Dollarhyde?
- Oh, Eileen.
- Bill says there's a variation in the gamma number 3, but he caught it in time.
Good.
Good.
- Who's there?
- Mr. Dollarhyde.
- I came about the infrared emulsion.
- Come in.
It's safe.
Put your back against the door.
Stool to the right.
You're the production controller?
- What are the conditions?
- Shooting from 8 feet.
- I can't use any lights.
- What's being photographed?
- Nocturnal animals.
- When do you need it?
- In four days.
- OK.
I'll stick this in a black bag.
- 1000 C infrared, sensitive has to be handled in total darkness.
Remember to be careful.
It's easier than the 1200 series.
- Fine.
- In case you're wondering, I keep the samples by touch.
I was wondering...
I gotta fly.
Perhaps Mr. Dollarhyde can drive you home.
No, that's OK.
No thanks.
Go on.
- I'll take you.
- No thanks.
- I'll order 1200ft of 1000 C tomorrow.
- Ride with me!
- No thanks!
I'll take the bus.
Ride with me!
I would like you to.
OK, sure.
I'll just get my stuff on.
How did you come to Gateway?
They had to hire the handicapped to get this Defense contract.
- You worked out well.
Everybody they hired did.
You speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants.
I trained in therapy for speech and hearing-impaired children.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
If you don't wanna talk, that's OK.
You're very direct, I like that.
I like what you have to say.
May I touch your face?
Are you smiling or frowning?
I guess I wanna know whether I should be quiet or not.
Take my word for it,
- I'm smiling.
- I didn't mean to offend you.
- Can I take you somewhere?
- Where?
It will be my surprise.
OK.
Sure.
- Are you apprehensive?
- No.
- The protective Mr. Dollarhyde is watching us.
- I want to!
In about two hours we're going to cap his tooth.
It's warm.
There...
Hear it?
You... rearrange the dead families into an audience.
You think what you do makes you into something different.
You're becoming...
What is it you're becoming?
The answer is in the way you use the mirrors.
What do the mirrors make you dream?
A little to your left.
Francis, that was a great dinner.
There's a gin and tonic, right in front of you.
What are you watching?
A little homework.
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, D.
Your heart's loud if you love me.
Is that you, D.?
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- If you show me, I'll make us some coffee
- No!
- Don't go back inside the house.
- I left my purse inside.
I'll get it, it's OK.
I mean, you should stay outside.
You look so good in the sun.
When...
Reba, when can I see you again?
We could meet at my house.
You got the message Lecktor called?
Yeah.
I'll call him in a few minutes.
We identified the tire tracks when Lounds was delivered to the "Tattler".
G-7816, Goodyear truck tires.
Our boy drives a van.
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you back?
When I'm done, Jack.
Will Graham of the fbi.
I'd like to talk to Dr. Lecktor.
Hello?
Hello, Will.
Congratulations on the job you did on Mr. Lounds.
I admired it.
What a cunning boy you are.
I'm sick of you, Lecktor.
You've got something to say, say it!
I want to help you.
Relax with yourself!
We don't invent our natures, they're issued to us with our lungs and pancreas and everything else.
Why fight it?
Fight what?
Did you really feel depressed after you shot Hobbes to death?
I think you probably did.
But it wasn't the act that got to you.
Didn't you feel so bad, because killing him felt so good.
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.
God's terrific.
He dropped a church roof on 34 worshippers last Wednesday, while groveling through a hymn.
Don't you think that felt good?
Why does it feel good, Dr. Lecktor?
It feels good, because God has power.
If one does what God does, enough times, one will become as God is.
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.
He got 140 Phillipinos in one plane crash last year.
Remember that earthquake in Italy last spring?
I enter.
The glass cutter.
The piece of glass is mine.
The house is mine.
I walk up these stairs,
I pass the children's toys.
The children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.
I moved to the door.
I step into the room.
I see you there.
I see me desired by you.
Accepted and loved.
In the silver mirrors of your eyes.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
OK.
Wait a minute.
- What was it?
- Pollen.
- Oh, Thanks for the ride.
- See you tomorrow.
Mr. Dollarhyde.
What are you doing here?
- Who is it?
- It's me.
- Hallo?
Who is it?
- It's me.
- Francis?
- No.
Not Francis.
Francis is gone.
Francis is gone, forever.
So what do we do?
The dream.
He dreams about being desired.
So he changes people into beings who want and desire him.
- Changes?
- It's a word.
Killing and arranging the people to imitate it.
Lecktor told me something.
If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
You put it together, our boy imitates being wanted and desired enough times, he believes he'll become one who is wanted and desired.
It'll all come true.
It started from abused kid.
Battered infant.
- There is something terrible about...
- Are you sympathising?
Absolutley, my heart bleeds for him as a child.
Someone took the kid and manufactured the monster, as the same time as an adult, he is irredeemable.
He butchers whole families to pursue trivial fantasies.
As an adult, someone should blow the sick fuck out of his socks.
Do you thing that's a contradiction, Jack?
Does this kind of understanding make you uncomfortable?
What about the mirrors?
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.
But he doesn't take anything.
He needs souvenirs from the houses, so he can relive the event.
Maybe he records it somehow.
So he can see himself accepted over and over and over again.
- VTR's, Polaroids, stills, what?
- How do I know?
How does he find them?
If we find out how he found them, we'll find him.
There is no connection between the two familes,
- we've done a dozen computer work.
- Jack!
All the women have a bloom on them.
He picked these women!
There's selection and design here.
- Look, admit we struck out this month.
The Lear Jet is standing by the basic lab stuff is on it.
You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, the photographer.
Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and 15 minutes!
We get the call, we roll!
- This thing'll be fresh!
- It's not over yet.
For Christ sake it's a foregone conclusion.
It's 11.30pm. The full moon is happening tonight.
Give it up!
It's too damn late!
- I gave it up.
Till you showed up with pictures of two dead families!
Fuckin' right!
I did it, I'd do it again!
Great, but don't talk to me about late, pal!
I'll tell you when it's too fucking late!
until then we go as late as I wanna take it.
A padlock.
That's why the bolt cutter.
What's that?
He used a boltcutter to trim away branch when he was watching from the woods.
Why didn't he use the bolt cutter on the garage door?
Because a deadbolt was there when they were killed.
Donald Jacobis birthday party was April 14th.
Sometime between April and August they changed the lock, but he thought there was a padlock.
From the street you can't see the glass on the Leeds' kitchen door.
There's a big, high fence there, but he was ready with his glass cutter.
Either he was casing far ahead, and we didn't check back far enough, or...
We checked.
Metcalf, it's Graham.
Is the Leeds and Jacobi stuff still there?
Have the guard down there call me.
Do it!
You know that's the Jacobi's cat.
He brought a bolt cutter, because he thought there was a padlock.
Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar, but you know it's their dog.
You see the woman?
The bloom on the woman?
You can see her again and again, anytime you want.
Doggie doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog... and the Jacobi cat... and the padlock on the door.
You know you need a bolt cutter and every other goddamn thing.
Because everything with you is seeing isn't?
Your primary sensory intake that makies your dream live is seeing.
The reflections... mirrors... images...
You've seen these films!
Haven't you, my man?
The guard in the storeroom.
- The cans!
- What cans?
- The tapes were transferred from home,
Where's the packaging of the films came?
There are films of the families in document storage, find them.
You got 'em?
Are there any labels?
Leeds can, Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
The Jacobi label says the same thing:
Gateway Lab, St. Louis.
Who processed the Jacobi film?
No, Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.
Stores send 'em out.
Have him peel the top label back.
Is there a label underneath?
It does, doesn't it?
I want a chopper in three minutes to Meigs Field.
At Meigs Field I want the Lear Jet prepped for St. Louis.
Where are you?
Are you here?
You're scaring me!
Stop it!
Francis, why are you doing this to me?
It's ugly.
Are you in this room?
Where are you?
You answer me!
We're looking for a man.
We know he works at Gateway.
We don't have his name, but we know he drives a van.
I got special stickers for vans.
I got 28 van permits here.
- Start feeding me names.
Is this Lieutenant Fisk?
Will Graham.
I need you to get the driver's licenses of these names.
The man we're looking for is blond, Caucasian, 20-40 years old, over six feet tall, 180-225 pounds.
First name?
A
- L-V-A-R-O.
First name Joseph.
A
- L-V-A-R-O, first name Joseph.
No.
Black hair.
No.
- Next.
Dillon, D-I-L-L-O-N.
First name Lincoln.
- Dillon.
D
- I-L-L-O-N, first name Lincoln.
No.
Next.
Male, Caucasian, 6ft 7 inches, 217 pounds, eyes brown, hair blond.
34 years old.
- Put it through the data fax.
Fast!
Buckle up.
We're landing in Lambert Field.
Fogel has four more names.
Two have dark hair.
Third's a woman.
Fourth is a handicapped permit.
This is our man.
Rural Route 3, Chester, Missouri.
Where is that?
We're 10.25 at the Hock Road offramp, Highway 904.
Let's go!
- Meeting point's up ahead.
- Go on to the house.
- Lieutenant Fisk said...
- Go on to the house!
Will?
Will, you won't need that.
The Swat Team will take him down, not us.
Will?
- This ought to be it.
- Kill your lights!
- Alright?
- I'm OK.
Griffin's hurt bad.
I'll wait for the backup.
Set up a road block on Route 3!
We're in the trees west of the house.
How far away's the backup?
I'm goin' around the back, stay here.
He's in there, Jack.
Someone is with him.
What?
Will, what did you say?
Wait for the back-up!
He's got someone with him, Jack.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Who are you?
Graham.
I'm Will Graham.
Looks worse, than it is.
See the turtles?
It was on the news.
I thought I'd work things out... and call you after.
I thought I wouldn't wait.
How many of them made it?
We should've talked at the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk about it here.
I'm not falling all over myself to talk about it much of anywhere, Jack.
How much do you know?
Not much.
The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago.
The second one in Atlanta was all over TV.
Did you ever think about giving me a call?
No.
Why not?
I quit.
Remember?
You look all right now.
I am all right.
If you can't look anymore, I understand.
Don't try to run a game down on me, Jack.
If I really didn't need you to come back, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks and a few days until the next full moon.
We have a better chance to get him fast if you help.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
Hi, Molly.
Think it'll keep them out, Dad?
Yep.
How many turtle eggs do you think are in here?
In this hatchery?
I'll bet there's 40 or 50 of them.
Crabs get most of the newborns, huh?
Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it, guaranteed.
What about the dogs?
Are they gonna get in here?
They can't dig under.
That's why we bury the wire down in the sand.
We need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be his friend, Jack.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, Molly,
I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.
We got it pretty good, don't we?
We have it more than good.
All that happened to you before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only look at evidence.
I wouldn't get deeply involved.
He'd never even see me or know my name.
If they find him, they'll have to take him down, not me.
What do you think?
I think you've already decided and you're not really asking.
If I were asking?
Stay here with me, me and Kevin.
But it's selfish, and I know it.
Come here.
OFFICER:
I'll come inside with you, if you want, to show you around.
Mr. Crawford said maybe you'd want to be alone, but...
That's right.
There's a VCR hooked up in your hotel room.
They transferred some home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen sliding door.
Used a glass cutter anchored to a suction cup.
His entry was skillful.
All the prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair, strong, size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood AB positive, typed from saliva on glass from licking the suction cup.
Why didn't he care that he left saliva on the glass?
It was hot out that night, so inside the house must have felt cool to him.
Intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he was rising, then shot Mrs. Leeds.
Bullet entered right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation.
Moderate elevation of serotonin and marked increase of free histamine level in gunshot wound indicates she lived at least five minutes after she was shot.
All her other injuries were post-mortem.
Direction and velocity of bloodstains on east wall indicate arterial spray.
Even with his throat cut, Leeds tried to fight because the intruder was moving to the children's room.
Bloodstains on west wall of master bedroom and matted sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained,
as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leed's chest, also believed to be post-mortem.
What did the killer do with them after they were dead?
VALERIE ON ANSWERING MACHINE:
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry, I can't come to the phone right now, but if you'd like to leave a message please do so after the beep, and I'll call you back as soon as I can.
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Twenty-ninth floor.
Going up.
When they were dead, he smashed the mirrors and began selecting pieces that he would use later on Mrs. Leeds.
Killing Mr. Leeds and the children would take less than a minute.
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem, four or five minutes later.
What did he do in the interval?
The smeared bloodstains on the west wall...
Hello?
WILL:
Molly?
MOLLY:
Will, is that you?
Yeah, it's me, honey.
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
I love you.
I love you too, baby.
What are you dreaming?
That's something you can't afford for me to know about, isn't it?
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
It was maddening to have to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg, but there wasn't any talcum powder in the bathroom.
The talcum powder came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You touched her with your bare hands, and then you put your gloves back on.
But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so that they could see you?
JACK:
Hello?
Jack, this is Graham.
Is Price still in Latent Prints?
Yeah, he's in charge of the Single Print Index now.
What do you got, Will?
Get him to Atlanta.
Atlanta PD swears they dusted everything, and their guy is pretty good.
He is good.
He's not as good as Price.
I'll get him on a plane in the morning.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails and the corneas of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves.
Our people swear he wore surgeon's gloves the whole time.
They dusted everything.
Your report didn't mention eyes.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
WILL:
Because Mrs. Leeds was a beautiful woman.
This is what the subject's teeth looked like.
The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed these from the impressions that we took of the bite marks on the Leeds woman here and the Jacobi woman in Birmingham last month.
As you can see, he has pegged lateral incisors, that's these teeth here and here.
SPRINGFIELD:
Vice and Narcotics, you take the K-Y cowboys and leather bars.
Marcus, Whitman, heads up at the funeral.
The rest of your assignments are on the sheet.
Let's go.
One more thing.
I've heard officers referring to this killer as the Tooth Fairy.
Well, I don't want to hear that in public, and I don't want to see it in internal memoranda.
That's it.
I know a burglar's gonna fence what he stole 'cause his motive is cash money.
I know his motive, so I go to work on fences.
This guy, we don't even have motive.
None of us have shit, and we know it.
WILL:
It's in his dreams.
His motive?
WILL:
Yeah.
His act fuels his fantasy.
Which is?
I don't know.
The commissioner was saying that you're the one who got Garrett Jacob Hobbs, and then Dr. Lecktor three years ago.
Lecktor killed nine people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
One's on a respirator at a hospital in Baltimore, the other's in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
The psychologists call him a psychopath.
They don't know what else to call him.
I understand he cut you pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's.
The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen.
The Jacobis in Birmingham had a cat, didn't they?
That's right.
We found a litter box downstairs, but we didn't find a cat.
Why don't you get Birmingham PD a methane probe out of Washington, have them cover the back yard.
Maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
SPRINGFIELD:
Yeah?
OVER PHONE:
This is Jimmy Price, FBI.
Let me put you on speakerphone.
Who am I talking to?
Jimmy, it's Jack Crawford.
You got Will Graham here, too.
I got a partial print with a tented arch, it's probably a thumb.
And the fragment of a palm off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.
Thumbprint came off the oldest kid's left eye.
It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.
Can we make an identification off of it?
Maybe, if he's ever been printed and he's in my index.
I want to work these up in my own darkroom.
I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon.
Thanks, Jimmy.
No comment.
JACK:
If we get lucky with that print, we're in, if Jimmy can find him in the index and if he's ever been printed.
If not, I don't know.
Hey, Will Graham!
What do you say?
You remember me?
Freddie Lounds, covered the Lecktor case for the Tattler, did the paperback.
So, Will, when did they call you in?
What do you got?
Hey, look, I'm buying lunch.
Lounds, why don't you give it a rest?
Hey, he's news.
I'm doing my job.
So, how does this guy compare with Lecktor?
How does he do them?
How's he do them, Will?
Keep the fuck away from me.
JACK:
Will, Will.
Son of a bitch snuck into the hospital while I was sedated after Lecktor.
He pulled back the sheets, and he took pictures.
Yeah, I know.
Look, don't expect too much from me, all right?
We only got three weeks left, and you're our best shot.
You think I'm gonna see him standing in the street and say, "There he is"?
That's Houdini you're thinking about.
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on until we get smart or get lucky.
He won't stop.
Why?
He's got a genuine taste for it.
You do know something about him.
Not enough.
I think I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mindset.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Yeah, I keep getting it for Christmas.
Did you get my card?
I got it.
Thank you.
How is Officer Stewart?
The one who was first to see my basement.
Stewart's fine.
Emotional problems, I hear.
Do you have any problems, Will?
No.
No, of course you don't.
I'm glad you came.
My callers are mostly clinical psychologists from cornfield universities somewhere.
Second-raters, the lot.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
And?
Very interesting.
Even to a layman.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Yes, I thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Yes?
You read about it?
In the papers.
I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
I thought you might have some ideas.
Why should I tell you?
You'd get to see the file on this case.
And there's another reason.
Pray tell.
Thought you might be curious to see if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
Then by implication you think you're smarter than me, since you caught me.
No.
I know that I'm not smarter than you.
Then how did you catch me?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantages?
You're insane.
You are very tan, Will.
Your hands are rough.
They don't look like cop's hands anymore.
And that shaving lotion is something a child would select.
It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it?
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
I don't think I'll persuade you at all.
You'll either do it or you won't.
Besides, we have Dr. Bloom working on it, and he's the best.
Do you have the file with you?
Yes.
Pictures?
Yes.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
No.
Dream much, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file, and I'll tell you what I think.
This is a very shy boy, Will.
What were their yards like?
Big back yards.
Fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, my dear Will, if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he might go outside to look at it.
Have you ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy for this sort of thing.
That's interesting.
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.
I considered it.
You came here to look at me, to get the old scent back again, didn't you?
I want your opinion.
I don't have one right now.
Well, when you have one, I'd like to hear it.
Can I keep this?
I haven't decided yet.
I'll study them.
When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too.
You can call me.
When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone.
Would you like to leave me your home phone number?
No.
Do you know how you caught me?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You can leave messages for me.
LECKTOR:
Do you know how you caught me?
The reason you caught me, Will, is we're just alike.
Do you understand?
Smell yourself.
Gotcha.
WOMAN ON PA: ...217 now boarding at Gate 1 2.
Eastern Airlines Flight 217 is now ready for boarding at Gate 1 2.
Get up against the bunk and face the wall.
Don't turn around, or I'll Mace you in the face.
Thank you so much.
I'll call you when I'm finished.
FEMALE OPERATOR:
Are you ready for your call?
Yes, thank you.
WOMAN 1 :
Paltrow, Christiansen Golub, Law Offices.
Excuse me.
I must have misdialed.
MALE OPERATOR:
Thank you for using ATT.
This is Operator 24.
Operator, I don't have the use of my arms.
Would you be so kind as to dial a number for me, please?
Certainly.
What's the number?
Area code 301 , 555-6624.
WOMAN 2:
The University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry.
Dr. Sidney Bloom, please.
He's not in, but I'll connect you to his office.
What's his secretary's name again?
Martha King.
Just a moment, please.
WOMAN 3:
Martha King's desk.
Hi, Martha.
Martha doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob Greer of Blaine Edwards publishing company,
Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of The Psychiatrist and the Law to someone.
Martha never sent me the address and phone number.
She'll be in in the morning.
Well, I've got to catch Federal Express in about five minutes.
I'd be immensely appreciative if you could pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
I don't see a Rolodex.
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Yeah...
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
All right.
The name we're looking for, last name Graham, the man the book is supposed to be sent to, a Mr. Will Graham.
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation, 10th and Pennsylvania,
Washington, D.C.
Now, I'll bet it has his home address there, too.
3680 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida.
Thank you so very much.
I've finished.
Mom!
Oh, my gosh.
It's all right.
Stewardess!
CAPTAIN ON PA SYSTEM:
Ladies and gentlemen, we are beginning our descent into Birmingham.
WILL:
You used a cutting tool on the branch so that you could see.
Then you passed the time whittling and dreaming.
When night came, you saw them pass by their bright windows.
Then you watched the shades go down, then you saw the lights go out, one by one.
Then after a while, you climbed down and you went in to them, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You watched them all goddamned day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
WILL:
I need Firearms and Tool Marks section out here on a severed branch.
I need to know what kind of cutting tool he used.
And then I need Bowman in Documents to fall on this carving.
JACK:
Is it weird?
The mark?
Yeah.
If Documents can't do the carving, I'll send it up to Langley.
WILL:
Did Price get an identification off the Leeds print?
No, Price hasn't found him in the index yet.
It's a hand search.
He's got half his department on it.
Listen, have you seen this week's Tattler?
It's not on my preferred reading list.
Well, your picture's all over the front page.
Who the hell was it?
Lounds?
Of course.
Who else?
God damn it, Jack!
I promised Molly!
I promised her!
Come in.
GUARD:
Dr. Chilton?
Yes?
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lecktor's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book.
We got him out of there and dug around.
Is that it?
Yes.
Put it down on my desk, Bonner.
Has anyone else seen this except you?
No.
SECRETARY:
Special Agent Crawford's office.
This is Dr. Chilton.
I need to speak to Mr. Graham right away.
He's not here, he's in Birmingham.
Special Agent Crawford is on the line with him now.
Please tell them this is very, very urgent.
I'll hold on.
Dr. Chilton, it's Jack Crawford.
You have Will Graham on the line, too.
CHILTON:
I have a note, or two pieces of a note that appears to be from that man who killed those people in Atlanta.
Where did you get it?
In Hannibal Lecktor's cell.
It was hidden in a book.
WILL:
Don't touch the note.
Can you read it to us?
It's written on toilet tissue.
"My dear Dr. Lecktor,
"I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me.
"I know that you alone can understand what I am becoming.
"You alone know the people I use to help me in these things
"are only elements undergoing change
"to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming,
"just as the source of light is burning.
"I have a collection of your press clippings.
"I think they are absurd, as are mine.
"'The Tooth Fairy,' what could be more inappropriate?
"Investigator Graham interests me,
"very purposeful-looking.
"I hope we can correspond."
There's a piece missing here.
Now I'll read the bottom part.
"After I hear back from you,
"I might send you something wet."
Signed "Avid Fan."
It has teeth marks pressed into it at the bottom.
Order a chopper, next thing smoking.
I don't care whose it is.
Two, call Alabama Air National Guard, get Graham back here right now.
Then call Documents and tell them to scramble a team.
I want everybody moving five minutes ago.
You understand?
JACK:
I have a Documents team on its way to you by helicopter to pick up the note.
Listen, after we've worked the note,
I want to replace it in Lecktor's cell.
I don't want Lecktor to know that we've found it, he might try to warn the killer somehow.
Where's Lecktor now?
CHILTON:
Holding cell.
How long can you keep him in there without him getting suspicious?
CHILTON:
Three, four hours.
Brian, we have a note coming in on the flight, possibly from the Tooth Fairy, number one priority.
It has to go to Hair and Fiber,
Latent Prints, and then Documents.
Will Graham and I will be walking it through.
One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.
And a couple of blue grains.
Work the hair.
What do we have for negative comparison?
Hair from Lecktor's comb, whiskers from Lecktor's razor they let him use.
This is hair from the security guard.
MAN:
How many guys handled this without gloves?
The guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
The cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had the oil washed off his fingers.
But the others...
One smudge.
Those aren't ridges.
It's just the texture of the paper.
I can fume for a print, but can't guarantee the iodine stains would fade out.
Ninhydrin?
Boost it with heat?
No.
We couldn't wash it after.
I can't get a print off this in the time you've got to get it back, Will.
BOWMAN:
How long do I have?
JACK:
Twenty minutes, max.
BOWMAN:
The main thing to find out is, how was Lecktor supposed to reply to him?
Which is probably the missing section, because at the top it says,
"I hope we can correspond," then comes the gap.
This note was written in ballpoint, but it looks like Lecktor went over this area with a felt-tip pen, then tore it away.
You're so sly, but so am I.
The aniline dyes used in the ink of the felt-tip pens like Lecktor used are transparent to infrared.
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.
This looks like the tip of a T here, here, and here.
At the end is what could be the top of an R.
There's three Ts and an R in "Tattler."
We know our boy reads it.
The article about me and Lecktor.
I don't know anybody else that's carried that.
Personal ads.
We believe the Tooth Fairy told Lecktor to reply to him through the personal ad section of the National Tattler.
The Chicago office is down there right now running through their ads.
We have cut into a line of communication between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor.
If we find Lecktor's reply we plan to pull it, substitute it with one of our own.
And this is what the Tooth Fairy will read.
Bill?
"Dear Avid Fan, inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements.
"Mementoes for you at Baltimore Central Left Luggage.
"Ticket number 72683."
It's a Secret Service letter drop.
We plan to stake it out.
When he shows, we'll grab him.
Anything from Chicago?
SARAH:
Not yet.
When do they go to press?
JACK:
Thirty-five minutes.
Christ.
Let's get to the physical.
There was no print.
Scale counts and core size of the hair match the blond hair found in the Jacobis'.
That note was written by your man.
Aside from the hair, three blue grains, dark flecks, went to Brian's end.
The grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine, from the cleaning man.
Several particles of dried blood, but not enough to type.
OVER PHONE:
This is Chester.
Who am I talking to?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford.
Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in it being telexed to you right now.
Read it. "Dear Avid Fan,
"You honor me.
You're very beautiful."
JACK:
Oh, Christ.
"I offer 100 prayers for your safety.
"Find help in Galatians 6:11, 15:2,
"Acts 3:3, Revelations 18:7,
"Jonah 6:8, John 6:22,
"Luke 1:7."
JACK:
Thanks.
Jimmy.
Did you get anywhere at all identifying him off the Leeds' prints?
Not yet.
Photography at Langley?
They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.
No.
And our ad has to go out in the same book code Lecktor used, or he'll know it wasn't Lecktor talking to him.
Book code?
"100 prayers" could be the page number, the paired numbers could be line and letter.
But what book?
JACK:
Not the Bible?
No.
Galatians 15:2.
Galatians only has six chapters.
The same with Jonah 6:8.
Jonah only has four chapters.
Lecktor was not using the Bible.
Then the Tooth Fairy probably named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
Right.
What about sweating Lecktor?
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.
He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
JACK:
Wonderful.
The Tooth Fairy would have named a book he knew Lecktor has access to.
He'd know it from articles he'd read about Lecktor.
JACK:
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they can get everything back in place.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books.
JACK:
Where?
BOWMAN:
Library of Congress.
Twenty-five minutes.
He won't make it in time.
Lecktor's ad runs as is, we decode it later.
Or we pull it, figure out the code and run our own ad next week.
And lose a week?
We got 17 days till the next full moon.
And I don't like Lecktor's ad running without knowing what it says.
It's your call, Will.
Run it.
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something else beside write?
We'll all feel sick for a very long time.
JACK:
And if Bowman still can't figure it out?
Then we'll bait him with something else in next week's Tattler.
JACK:
What, for instance?
Me.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
Why not?
Don't you think we can provoke him?
Maybe.
Maybe he can be provoked.
What I was thinking about is you.
You're getting deeper and deeper into this.
Good night.
Sidney.
I'll talk to you.
Last time you did that you did a real good job of pushing yourself all out of shape.
You try it on again or you go through some big trauma, you could relapse, my friend.
Sidney, don't worry about me.
I'm working the evidence, making moves.
That's all.
I'm fine.
Bowman just struck out.
It is not books in Lecktor's cell.
Price?
He just heard.
It's a bust-out.
As evidence, the Leeds print will get us a conviction if we could ever find the guy.
But he must never have been printed because he is not in our index.
We are not gonna identify him off the print.
I'll use Lounds.
What for?
Our boy doesn't read the New York Times literary supplement.
He reads Lounds in the Tattler.
What else should we cover?
He put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.
I believe he did this to make sure we wouldn't think he was gay.
He's molested all of his male victims.
He may be impotent with members of the opposite sex.
Our forensic psychologists have projected, though I'm not sure, that he may have had sexual relations with his mother.
So, how long do you plan to stay in Washington?
Till we've taken out the Tooth Fairy.
LOUNDS:
Can the Tattler rely on getting the straight stuff from you?
Absolutely.
How does working on this case affect your sex life?
Mine?
It doesn't affect mine, it affects yours.
Go fuck yourself.
Look, pal of mine, you're news.
Shoot the pictures.
All right, Symie, let's shoot them.
I'm in the shots with Graham.
What?
I'm in the shots with you.
Come on, you want this to look real or not?
Make sure the theater sign across the street is just slightly out of focus.
We want him to be able to read it so he can find it, but we don't want to look too obvious.
You make sure that I look excellent.
All right, shoot it.
One more.
One more.
That's enough.
Okay, Graham.
Hey, always nice, huh?
Let's have lunch, call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.
Dr. Bloom.
I need them on my desk in two hours.
Did Bowman break the code yet?
No.
Tools and Firearms say the cutting tool used on the severed branch was a common bolt cutter.
I got a call from Asian Studies at Langley.
The mark you found on the tree?
Yeah?
It's a Chinese character considered a lucky sign in gambling.
That same character appears on a Mah Jongg piece.
It means "Red Dragon." Mean anything to you?
No.
If he shows, and he's smart, he'll approach you from the front, pass, turn, try and take you from behind.
How's your hearing?
It's good.
You'll wear a wire, one-way.
We'll hear you, you won't hear us.
You checked out a Charter Arms .44 Special Bulldog?
Yeah.
Load these in it.
You ever fire them?
Glaser Safety Slugs.
Yeah.
Number 12 shots.
Suspended in liquid Teflon in a copper casing.
On impact it all opens up in the target.
Guaranteed one-shot stop.
You got body armor?
Yeah, Kevlar Second Chance.
I hope you get one.
'Cause he's gone for the head shot eight of eleven times?
Let's walk the route.
WOMAN ON PA:
United Flight 849 to Newark now boarding at Gate 7...
United Flight 849 to Newark now boarding at Gate 7.
Someone's coming.
Go!
Don't!
Don't move!
Take the money!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Clear!
What you moving in slow motion for, man?
I'm being mugged!
For real.
Can you believe that?
Pay up.
RADIO ANNOUNCER: ...in sports, the Cubs lost again.
Hey!
You know who I am?
I don't want to know who you are.
According to you, I'm a sexual pervert.
"An animal," you said.
You know who I am now?
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Open your eyes.
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.
Your job is to report.
That's why you're here.
And if you don't open your eyes,
I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Well, here I am.
Look at the screen.
William Blake's The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed In The Rays Of The Sun.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Leeds.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi.
Do you see?
Yes.
The next family as they will look when I go to visit them.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Leeds, later.
Her husband beside her.
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.
The Dragon rampant.
Freddie Lounds, your photograph.
No.
No what?
Not me, please.
Please.
Are you a man?
Yes.
Do you imply that I'm queer?
God, no.
Before me, you are a slug in the sun.
You are privy to a great becoming, and you recognize nothing.
You are an ant in the afterbirth.
It is your nature to do one thing correctly, tremble.
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, Lounds, you and the others, you owe me awe.
We have one more piece of work to do.
If he takes off the mask, I am a dead man.
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!
You will read this into the tape recorder.
Go.
"I have had a great privilege.
"I have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the Red Dragon.
"All I wrote about him were lies.
"Will Graham made me write them
"to pull him into a trap in Washington, District of Columbia.
"Will Graham, you will learn from my own lips
"how much you have to dread because I was forced to lie.
"He will be more merciful to me than to you.
"You will lie awake in fear of what the Red Dragon will do.
"I will be a testament to the truth of this."
You did very well.
Will you let me go now?
Please?
You will tell the truth?
I promise.
Good.
We'll seal your promise with...
We'll seal your promise
with a kiss.
MAN ON RADIO:
We'll be showing five possible answers to the questions I'll be asking.
Any member of a team may buzz in an answer, but if incorrect, then the other team will have the opportunity...
Bowman, just skip the cryptography and tell me what the hell it says, okay?
Did he try to say anything at all?
No, he sure didn't.
He never regained consciousness.
Did you hear the tape?
Yeah.
Listen, Bowman just broke the code that Lecktor used in the Tattler personal ad.
It was the State of Maryland statutes.
You need to know what it said right now.
What?
Listen to me.
Everything is okay.
I've taken care of it.
What is it, Jack?
The bastard gave him your home address.
It said, "Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway,
"Captiva, Florida.
"Save yourself.
Kill them all."
Get me a plane.
Will!
Mom.
Huh?
What time...
What?
Someone's outside.
There are noises.
Where?
Outside.
Mom...
Go back to your room and close the door.
Mom...
Do it now.
Ma'am, are you all right?
What?
What is it?
What is it?
What's going on?
OFFICER:
Ma'am, I think you should come back inside.
What's going on?
Come back inside.
Please.
I think you should come back inside.
I'm sorry, Molly.
I'm sorry about all of this.
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.
He's after you now, isn't he?
This is just a precaution.
Kevin, why don't you run down to the water, check out the dock?
I want to hang around here.
I'm in the kitchen, Mom.
Okay.
What is that about?
What, he's afraid to leave you alone with me now?
He saw the article in the Tattler, right?
I wanted to talk with him about it, but he said he wanted to bring it up to you, face to face.
Good for him.
Kevin, help me unpack, will you?
Then we'll go get some groceries.
You and Mom are very well-protected, you know.
No one's gonna find out where you are.
KEVIN:
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
No.
KEVIN:
This guy is trying to kill us?
We don't know that.
When are you going to kill him?
I'm not.
It's only my job to find him.
Barry's mom had this newspaper.
It said you were in a special hospital.
Well, it was a regular hospital, then I was transferred into the psychiatric wing.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
I don't know.
Was it because in the papers it said it was this man Lecktor?
Mmm-hmm.
What happened?
Well, Lecktor was attacking college girls, then he killed them.
How?
In bad ways.
He was a psychiatrist.
One of the girls was his patient, and I went to talk to him about her.
I tried to build feelings in my imagination like the killer had so that I would know why he did what he did, because that would help me find him.
When I was sitting in Lecktor's office and I looked up, I saw a book on his shelf.
It had pictures of war wounds in it.
And I knew it was him.
So I went to a pay phone down the hall to call the police and that's when he attacked me.
You and Mom came to see me in the hospital, and that helped a lot.
But after my body got okay,
I still had his thoughts going around in my head.
And I stopped talking to people.
And a doctor friend of mine, a Dr. Bloom, asked me to get some help.
And I did.
Then after a while I felt better, and I was okay again.
And the way he thought felt that bad?
Kevin, they're the ugliest thoughts in the world.
So, what kind of coffee do you like?
You like that Folgers stuff, right?
Yeah.
Mom likes that, too.
When can we go home, Dad?
I don't know, Kevin.
So, where are things?
Nowhere.
Everything we've tried is either a dead end or it's backfired.
Crawford's already planning the next crime scene so they can get it fresh.
We've got about six more days till the next full moon.
Can you quit?
No.
What's next?
I go to Atlanta.
Crawford?
No.
I have to be alone.
You're talking about doing exactly what you said you...
This killing, it's gotta stop.
William, you're gonna make yourself sick.
Or get yourself killed.
You and Kevin should go to Montana.
See your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.
And I'll come up and get you afterwards.
VALERIE ON ANSWERING MACHINE:
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry I can't come to the phone right now.
I'm sorry, too.
WAITRESS:
Excuse me.
Coffee.
It's just you and me now, sport.
I'm gonna find you, God damn it.
Mr. Dollarhyde?
Eileen.
Bill told me to tell you there was a variation in the gamma of number three.
But he caught it in time.
Eileen, good.
Good.
REBA:
Who's there?
Mr. Dollarhyde.
I came about the low-light infrared emulsion.
REBA:
Oh, yeah.
Come on in, it's safe.
Put your back against the door.
There's a stool just to your right.
You're the production controller from Admin, right?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions?
Shooting from maybe eight feet.
I can't use any lights.
Okay, what's being photographed?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
Four days.
Okay, let me stick this in the black hole.
1000-C infrared sensitive has to be handled in total darkness.
Remember to be very careful with it.
But still, it's easier to handle than the 1200 series.
It'll be fine.
In case you're wondering,
I keep the samples straight by touch code.
No, I wasn't wondering.
Reba, I gotta fly.
Maybe Mr. Dollarhyde can drive you home tonight.
No, that's okay.
I'll take care of myself.
RALPH:
I can change things around.
No, thanks, go on.
Okay.
I'll take you.
No, thanks.
I'll order you 1200 feet of 1000-C in the morning.
Ride with me.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus.
I do it all the time.
Ride with me.
It would be because I would like you to.
Okay, sure.
Let me get my stuff on.
How did you come to Gateway?
Oh, they had to hire the handicapped to shape up their employment practices to get this defense contract.
You worked out well.
Everybody they hired did.
You know, you speak very well.
Although you avoid fricatives and sibilants.
At the Riker Institute for the Blind,
I trained in therapy for speech and hearing-impaired children.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Mmm-hmm.
You know, if you don't want to talk, that's okay.
But I hope you will, because you're very direct, and I like that, and I like what you have to say.
May I touch your face?
I want to know whether you're smiling or frowning.
I guess I want to know whether I should be quiet or not.
Take my word for it.
I'm smiling.
I didn't mean to offend you.
On the way, can I take you somewhere?
Where?
It would be my surprise.
Okay, sure.
Are you apprehensive?
No.
The very protective Mr. Dollarhyde over there is watching us.
No, no, I want to.
In about two hours we're going to cap his tooth.
REBA:
Yeah.
DOCTOR:
It's warm.
Back a little bit.
There.
You hear it?
Yeah.
You rearrange the dead families into an audience to see what you do.
You think that what you do will make you into something different.
You are becoming.
What is it you think you're becoming?
The answer is in the way you use the mirrors.
What do the mirrors make you dream you're becoming?
A little to your left.
Francis, that was a great dinner.
Thank you.
I made you a gin and tonic.
It's right in front of you.
What are you watching?
It's just a little homework.
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, D.
Is there a fire in the sky?
Your heart's loud.
Is there a moon up there?
If you'll hold me...
Is anything alive now?
This darkness is what I hear
This is a breathless silence
A moment out of time
I see your face in the shadows
The tell-tale signs are in your eyes
Aching with a passion inside
Deep as the river
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
Is there a flame in the dark?
Is there a bright heart star?
These creatures look the same now
We freeze wherever we are
We wake alone in the blackness
We sleep wherever we fall
One dream all around us
This big hush infects us all
Forever in this half-light
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
REBA:
Is that you, D?
DOLLARHYDE:
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Hi.
Good morning.
Morning.
You know, if you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee.
No, no...
Don't go back inside the house.
Why?
I left my purse inside.
I'll get it.
It's okay.
I mean, you should stay outside, it's...
It's...
It's 'cause you look so good in the sun.
Okay.
When...
Reba, when can I see you again?
Oh!
Um...
We could meet at my house.
JACK OVER PHONE:
You got the message Lecktor called?
Yeah.
I arranged for him to have a phone.
I gotta call him in a few minutes.
Good.
Listen, we identified the tire tracks left when Lounds was delivered back to the Tattler.
G-781 6 Goodyear truck tires.
Looks like our boy drives a van.
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you coming back?
When I'm done, Jack.
Yeah, this is Will Graham of the FBI.
Dr. Chilton arranged for me to talk to Dr. Lecktor.
Hello?
LECKTOR:
Hello, Will.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds.
I admire that enormously.
Oh, what a cunning boy you are.
I'm sick of you crazy sons of bitches.
You got something to say, say it.
I want to help you.
You'd be more comfortable if you relax with yourself.
We don't invent our natures, they're issued to us, along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else.
Why fight it?
Fight what?
Did you really feel so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death?
I didn't know you then, but I think you probably did.
But it wasn't the act that got you down, was it?
Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?
And why shouldn't it feel good?
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.
God's terrific.
He dropped a church roof on 34 of his worshippers last Wednesday night in Texas as they were groveling through a hymn to his majesty.
Don't you think that felt good?
Why does it feel good, Dr. Lecktor?
It feels good, Will, because God has power.
And if one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.
He got 140 Filipinos in one plane crash last month.
Remember that earthquake in Italy last spring?
WILL:
I enter.
The glass cutter.
The piece of glass I take out is mine.
The house is mine.
I walk up these stairs,
I pass the children's toys.
The children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.
I move to the door.
I step into the room.
I see you there.
And I see me desired by you.
Accepted and loved in the silver mirrors of your eyes.
Father, look in my eyes
See me as I really am
You made me
Now take me
RALPH:
I'm gonna talk to Fogel tomorrow...
Tell me how it feels now
Behold your flesh has come of age
RALPH:
Wait a minute.
Forsake me, you break me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that scares me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that dares me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that haunts me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that taunts me
Mother, let me heal you
Your pain has lasted far too long
Release it, it kills you
What was it?
Pollen.
Oh.
Thanks for the ride.
See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
The love you would not share grows tired of waiting
Mr. Dollarhyde.
What are you doing here?
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that scares me
Strong as I am
REBA:
Who is it?
DOLLARHYDE:
It's me.
Who?
Who is it?
DOLLARHYDE:
It's me.
Oh.
Francis?
No, not Francis.
Francis is gone.
Francis is gone forever.
So, what are we doing?
The dream.
He dreams about being wanted and desired, so he changes people into beings who want and desire him.
Changes?
It's a word.
Killing and arranging the people to imitate it.
And Lecktor told me something.
If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
You put it together, you get, if our boy imitates being wanted and desired enough times, he believes he will become one who is wanted and desired and accepted.
It'll all come true.
This started from an abused kid, a battered infant.
There's something terrible about...
JACK:
What, are you sympathizing with this guy now?
Absolutely.
My heart bleeds for him as a child.
Someone took a kid and manufactured a monster.
At the same time, as an adult, he's irredeemable.
He butchers whole families to pursue trivial fantasies.
As an adult, someone should blow this sick fuck out of his socks.
Do you think that's a contradiction, Jack?
Does this kind of understanding make you uncomfortable?
What about the mirrors?
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.
But he doesn't take anything.
There's no souvenirs taken from the houses.
He needs souvenirs or trophies to re-live the event.
Maybe he records it somehow.
So he could see himself accepted over and over and over again.
VTRs, Polaroids, stills, what?
How do I know?
How does he find them?
When we find out how he found them, we'll find him.
There is no connection between the two families.
We've done a dozen computer runs.
Jack, all the women have a bloom on them.
He didn't win them in a lottery, he picked these women.
There's selection and design in his choices.
Look, admit we struck out this month.
The Lear Jet is standing by, the basic lab stuff is on it.
You, Zeller, Jimmy Price, the photographer, anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and 15 minutes.
We get the call, we roll.
The scene will be fresher than we've ever had it.
It's not over yet.
For Christ's sake!
That's a foregone conclusion.
It's 11:30 p.m., the full moon is happening tonight.
Give it up!
Forget this month, it's too damn late!
I gave it up.
Till you showed up with pictures of two dead families, knowing goddamn well that I'd imagine families three, four, five and six.
Right?
You're fucking right I did, and I'd do it again!
Great!
But don't talk to me about late, pal,
I'll tell you when it's too fucking late!
Until then, we go as late as I want to take it!
A padlock.
That's why the bolt cutter.
What's that?
He used a bolt cutter to trim away the branch when he was watching from the woods.
Why didn't he use the bolt cutter on the garage door?
Because a deadbolt was there when they were killed.
Donald Jacobi's 12th birthday party was April 14th.
Sometime between April 14th and August 1 they changed the lock.
But he thought there was a padlock there.
From the street, you can't see the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door.
There's a big, high fence there.
But he was ready with his glass cutter.
So either he was casing far ahead and we didn't check back far enough,
or...
JACK:
We checked.
Don't talk.
Metcalfe, is the Leeds and Jacobi stuff still in the storeroom?
Have the guard down there call me.
Do it.
You know that's the Jacobis' cat.
You brought a bolt cutter 'cause you thought there was a padlock.
The Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog, don't you, my man?
See the woman?
The bloom on the woman?
You can see her again and again anytime you want.
Doggie doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog.
And the Jacobi cat.
And the padlock on the door.
And you know you need a bolt cutter and every other goddamn thing because everything with you is seeing, isn't it?
Your primary sensory intake that makes your dream live is seeing.
Reflections, mirrors, images...
You've seen these films.
Haven't you, my man?
It's the guard in the storeroom.
The cans.
What cans?
The tapes were transferred from home movies.
Where's the packaging the films came in?
There's films of the families in the document storage.
Find them.
You got them?
Are there any labels?
Leeds can, Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
The Jacobi label will say the same thing as the Leeds label.
Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
JACK:
Who processed the Jacobi film?
No.
Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.
Stores send them out.
Have him peel the top label back.
JACK:
Is there a label underneath?
It does, doesn't it?
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes to Meigs Field.
At Meigs Field,
I want the Lear Jet prepped and a plan filed with St. Louis.
Where are you?
Are you here?
You're scaring me with this!
Will you just stop it?
Francis, why are you doing this to me?
It's ugly!
Don't you know that I'll always be true?
Are you in this room?
Where are you?
You answer me!
And take my hand
Oh, won't you come with me
And walk this land
Please, take my hand
JACK:
We're looking for a man.
We know he works at Gateway.
We don't have his name, but we know he drives a van.
MAN OVER PHONE:
Under "Employee Facilities,"
I've got special stickers for vans.
Yeah, I got 28, 29 van permits in the computer.
JACK:
Start feeding me names.
Is this Lieutenant Fisk?
Will Graham.
Listen, I need you to punch up the driver's licenses of the names I'm gonna feed you.
The man we're looking for is blond, Caucasian, twenty to forty years old, over six feet tall, 180 to 225 pounds.
First name?
Alvaro.
A-L-V-A-R-O.
First name Joseph.
Alvaro.
A-L-V-A-R-O.
First name Joseph.
No.
Black hair.

Next.

First name Lincoln.
FISK:
No.
Next.
Male.
Caucasian.
Six foot-seven, 217 pounds.
Eyes brown, hair blond.
Thirty-four years old.
Put it through the data-fax.
Fast.
You guys better buckle up.
We're on approach to Lambert Field.
JACK:
Fogel has four more names.
He knows two, both dark hair, third's a woman, fourth is a handicapped parking permit.
This is our man.
Rural Route 3, Chester, Missouri.
Where is that?
From the airport you're a few minutes closer.
We'll 10-25 at the Hark Road off ramp, Highway 94.
Let's go!
Meet point's up ahead.
Go on to the house.
But Lieutenant Fisk said...
Go on to the house.
JACK:
Will?
You're not gonna need that.
A SWAT team is gonna take him down, not us.
Will?
Will!
OFFICER 1 :
This ought to be it right here.
Kill your lights.
OFFICER 2:
Are you all right?
OFFICER 3:
I'm okay.
Griffin's hurt bad.
I'll wait for the backup.
JACK:
Set up a roadblock on Route 3.
Graham and I are in the trees west of the house.
WILL:
How far away is the backup unit?
I'm going around the back.
Stay in the trees.
He's in there, Jack.
And he's got somebody in there with him.
JACK:
What?
Will, what did you say?
JACK ON RADIO:
Will.
Wait for the backup, Will.
He's got somebody in the house with him, Jack.
JACK:
Will.
Stop it.
Stop it!
Three, four
In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey
Don't you know that I love you?
In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby
Don't you know that I'll always be true?
Oh, won't you come with me
And take my hand
Oh, won't you come with me
And walk this land
Please, take my hand
It's okay.
Who are you?
Graham.
I'm Will Graham.

We should've talked at the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk about it here.
I'm not falling all over myself to talk about it much of anywhere, Jack.
How much do you know?
Not much.
The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago.
The second one in Atlanta was all over TV.
Did you ever think about giving me a call?
- No.
- Why not?
I quit.
Remember?
You look all right now.
I am... all right.
If you can't look anymore,
I understand.
Don't try to run a game down on me, Jack.
If I really didn't need you to come back, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks and a few clays until the next full moon.
We have a better chance to get him fast...
If you help.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
L-li, Molly.
- Think it'll keep them out, dad?
- Yep.
How many turtle eggs think are in here?
Huh?
In this hatchery?
I'll bet there's 40 or 50 of them.
Crabs get most of the newborns, huh?
Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it, guaranteed.
What about the dogs?
- Are they gonna get in here?
- No, they can't dig under.
You see, that's why we bury the wire down in the sand.
We need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be his friend, Jack.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, Molly,
I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.
We got it pretty good, don't we?
We have it more than good.
All that happened to you before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only look at evidence.
I wouldn't get deeply involved.
He'd never even see me or know my name.
If they find him, they'll have to take him down, not me.
Whatcha think?
I think you've already decided and you're not really asking.
If I were asking?
Stay here with me, me and Kevin.
But it's selfish, and I know it.
Come here.
I'll come inside with you, if you want, to show you around.
Mr. Crawford said maybe you'd want to be alone, but...
That's right.
There's a... vcr hooked up in your hotel room.
They transferred some home movies of both families onto half-inch vhs.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen sliding door.
Used a glass cutter anchored to a suction cup.
His entry was skillful.
All the prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair, strong, size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood ab positive, typed from saliva on glass from licking the suction cup.
Why didn't he care that he left saliva on the glass?
It was hot out that night, so inside the house must have felt cool to him.
Intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he was rising, then shot Mrs. Leeds.
Bullet entered right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation.
Moderate elevation of serotonin and marked increase of free histamine level in gunshot wound indicates...
She lived at least five minutes after she was shot.
All her other injuries were post-mortem.
Direction and velocity of bloodstains on east wall indicate arterial spray.
Even with his throat cut, Leeds tried to fight because the intruder was moving to the children's room.
Bloodstains on west wall of master bedroom and matted sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained,
as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leeds' chest, also believed to be post-mortem.
What'd the killer do with them after they were dead?
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry, I can't come to the phone right now, but if you'd like to leave a message, please do so after the beep, and I'll call you back as soon as I can.
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem, four or five minutes later.
What the?
What'd he do in the interval?
The smeared bloodstains on the west wall...
Uh...
- Hello?
- Molly?
- Will, is that you?
- Yeah, it's me, honey.
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
I love you.
I love you too, baby.
What are you dreaming?
That's something you can't afford for me to know about, isn't it?
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
It was maddening to have to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg, but there wasn't any talcum powder in the bathroom.
The talcum powder came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You touched her with your bare hands, and then you put your gloves back on.
But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so that they could see ya?
Hello?
Jack, this is Graham.
Is price still in latent prints?
Yeah, he's in charge of the single print index now.
What do you got, will?
Get him to Atlanta.
Atlanta pd swears they dusted everything, and their guy is pretty good.
He is good.
He's not as good as price.
I'll get him on a plane in the morning.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails and the corneas of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves, Jack.
Our people swear he wore surgeon's gloves the whole time.
They dusted everything.
Your report didn't mention eyes.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
Because Mrs. Leeds was a beautiful woman.
All right, all right.
Settle down, now.
Sit down, please.
After-house interviews will be extended an additional four blocks.
Rni's loaned us a couple of clerks to cross-match the airline reservations between Birmingham last month and Atlanta now.
Dr. princi.
This is what the subject's teeth looked like.
The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed these from the impressions that we took of the bite marks on the Leeds woman here and the jacobi woman in Birmingham last month.
As you can see, he has pegged lateral incisors, that's these teeth here and here.
All right.
Investigator Graham, you've worked this kind of thing before.
Can you add anything?
Could you come up to the front?
I don't think he's a drifter, acting upon victims of opportunity.
Skillful entry indicates premeditation and planning.
Therefore, I believe he's an organized individual who probably lives life competently with little or no leakage.
Meaning in appearance he could be absolutely anyone?
That's right.
Bodies being arranged into an audience and the mirrors make me believe that there's a rich and intense fantasy life going on here.
The elevated experience is the fantasy.
The act fuels the fantasy.
To discover what he thinks he's doing in there, why he picked who he picked, did what he did, to understand his motive, you have to know his illusions, his dreams.
Which are?
I don't know.
What else do you have for us?
That's all I have.
All right.
Vice and narcotics, you take the k-y cowboys and the leather bars.
Marcus, Whitman, heads up at the funeral.
The rest of your assignments are on the sheet.
Let's go.
Oh, well, one more thing.
I've heard officers referring to this killer as the tooth fairy.
Yeah.
Well, I don't want to hear that in public, and I don't want to see it in internal memoranda.
That's it.
I know a burglar's gonna fence what he stole 'cause his motive is cash money.
I know his motive, so I go to work on fences.
This guy, we don't even have motive.
None of us have shit, and we know it.
It's in his dreams.
- His motive?
- Yeah.
The commissioner was saying that you're the one who, uh, got Garrett Jacob hobbs, and then Dr. lecktor three years ago.
Lecktor killed nine people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
One's on a respirator at a hospital in Baltimore, the other's in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What the psychologists say was wrong with lecktor?
The psychologists call him a psychopath.
They don't know what else to call him.
I understand he cut you pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's.
The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen.
The jacobis in Birmingham had a cat, didn't they?
That's right.
We found a litter box downstairs, but we didn't find a cat.
Why don't you get Birmingham pd a methane probe out of Washington, have them cover the backyard.
Maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
Yeah?
This is Jimmy price, FBI.
- Let me put you on speakerphone.
- Who am I talking to?
Uh, Jimmy, it's Jack Crawford.
You got will Graham here, too.
I got a partial print with a tented arch, it's probably a thumb.
And the fragment of a palm off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.
Thumbprint came off the oldest kid's left eye.
It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.
Can we make an identification off of it?
Maybe, if he's ever been printed and he's in my index.
I want to work these up in my own darkroom.
I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon.
Thanks, Jimmy.
No -- no comment.
If we get lucky with that print, we're in, if Jimmy can find him in the index and if he's ever been printed.
- Hey, will Graham!
- If not, I don't know.
Whadda ya hear?
Whadda ya say?
You remember me?
Freddie lounds, covered the lecktor case for the tattler, did the paperback.
So, come on, will, when did they call you in?
What do you got?
Hey, look, I'm buying lunch, all right?
Hey, lounds, why don't you give it a rest?
Hey, he's news.
I'm doing my job.
So, how does this guy compare with lecktor?
Huh?
What does he do to 'em?
How's he do 'em?
How's he do 'em, will?
Keep the fuck away from me.
Will, will.
The son of a bitch snuck into the hospital while I was sedated after lecktor.
He pulled back the sheets, and he took pictures.
Yeah, I know.
Look, don't expect too much from me, all right?
We only got three weeks left, and you're our best shot.
What, you think I'm gonna see him standing in the street, and say, "there he is"?
That's Houdini you're thinking about.
The tooth fairy's gonna go on until we get smart or we get lucky.
- He won't stop.
- Why?
He's got a genuine taste for it.
You do know something about him.
Not enough.
Think I'll go see lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mindset.
- Yeah?
- Hey, hotshot.
- You doing some good?
- Nothing you'd notice.
- I miss ya.
- Me too.
I miss my husband.
What's going on?
Day-to-day is boring.
Tell me what you're doing.
I'm eatin' room service.
They don't have a lock on anything, Molly.
There's not enough physical evidence, or else I haven't done enough with it yet.
Were you gonna be in Atlanta long?
I mean, you know, I'm not bugging you about coming home, but I was just wondering.
I don't know.
I gotta go to Baltimore tomorrow.
To do what?
Uh, I got to see somebody.
I was thinking about, um, painting the kitchen.
What color do you like?
Will, are you there?
Uh, I don't know, paint it -- let's paint it yellow.
Yellow's kind of a bad color for me.
I'll look green at breakfast.
- Blue, then.
- I don't know about blue.
Look, paint the damn room battleship grey, what do I care?
I'm sorry.
Look, when I get back, we'll go to the paint store together, and we'll get some chips, and we'll figure out...
Look, will, I don't know why I'm talking trivia.
I called to tell you that I love you and I miss you.
And I'm -- you're doing the right thing.
And it's costing you, too, i know that.
I'm here.
I'm right here, and I'll be here whenever you come home.
I'll meet you if you need me to...
Anywhere.
Anytime.
That's what I called to tell you.
Molly...
I love you.
Goodnight.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Yeah, I keep getting it for Christmas.
Did you get my card?
I got it.
Thank you.
And how is officer Stewart?
The one who was first to see my basement.
Stewart's fine.
Emotional problems, I hear.
Do you have any problems, will?
No.
No, of course you don't.
I'm glad you came.
My callers are mostly clinical psychologists from cornfield universities somewhere.
Second-raters, the lot.
Dr. bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of clinical psychiatry.
- And?
- Very interesting.
- Even to a layman.
- Layman?
A layman?
An interesting term.
So many experts on government grants.
And you say, you're a layman?
But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, will?
- Do you know how you did it?
- What does it matter now?
It doesn't matter to me, will.
I want you to help me, Dr. lecktor.
Yes, I thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Yes?
- You read about it?
- In the papers.
I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think i was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
- I thought you might have some ideas.
- Why should I tell you?
You'd get to see the file on this case.
- And there's another reason.
- Pray tell.
Thought you might be curious to see if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
Then, by implication, you think you're smarter than me, since you caught me.
No.
I know that I'm not smarter than you.
- Then how did you catch me, will?
- You had disadvantages.
What disadvantages?
You're insane.
You are very tan, will.
Your hands are rough.
They don't look like cop's hands anymore.
And that shaving lotion is something a child would select.
It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it?
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
I don't think I'll persuade you at all.
You'll either do it or you won't.
Besides, we have Dr. bloom working on it, and he's the best.
- Do you have the file with you?
- Yes.
- Pictures?
- Yes.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
No.
Dream much, will?
Goodbye, Dr. lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file, and I'll tell you what I think.
This is a very shy boy, will.
What were their yards like?
Big back yards.
Fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, my dear will, if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he might go outside to look at it.
Have you ever seen blood in the moonlight, will?
Appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy for this sort of thing.
That's interesting.
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.
I considered it.
You came here to look at me, to get the old scent back again, didn't you?
I want your opinion.
I don't have one right now.
Well, when you have one, I'd like to hear it.
- Can I keep this?
- I haven't decided yet.
I'll study them.
When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too.
You can call me.
When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone.
Would you like to leave me your home phone number?
No.
Do you know how you caught me, will?
Goodbye, Dr. lecktor.
You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
Do you know how you caught me?
The reason you caught me, will, is we're just alike.
Do you understand?
Smell yourself.
Gotcha.
217 now boarding at gate 12.
Eastern airlines, flight 217 is now ready for boarding at gate 12.
Get up against the bunk and face the wall.
Don't turn around, or I'll mace you in the face.
Thank you so much.
I'll call you when I'm finished.
Are you ready for your call?
Yes, thank you.
Paltrow, Christiansen golub, law offices.
Excuse me.
I must have misdialed.
Thank you for using att.
This is operator 24.
Operator, I don't have the use of my arms.
Would you be so kind as to, uh...
Dial a number for me, please?
Certainly.
What's the number?
Area code 301, 555-6624.
The university of Chicago, department of psychiatry.
Dr. Sidney bloom, please.
He's not in, but I'll connect you to his office.
What's his secretary's name again?
Uh, Martha king.
Just a moment, please.
- Martha king's desk.
- Hi, Martha.
Martha doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob greer of Blaine Edwards publishing company.
Dr. bloom asked me to send a copy of the psychiatrist and the law to someone.
Martha never sent me the address and phone number.
She'll be in in the morning.
Well, I've got to catch federal express in about five minutes.
I'd be immensely appreciative if you could pull it out of her rolodex for me.
I don't see a rolodex.
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
- Yeah...
- Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter g.
All right.
The name we're looking for, the last name Graham, the man the book is supposed to be sent to, a Mr. will Graham.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, 10th and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
Now, I'll bet it has his home address there, too.
3680 desoto highway, captiva, Florida.
Thank you... so very much.
I've finished.
Mom!
Oh, my gosh..
It's all right.
Stewardess!
Ladies and gentlemen, we are beginning our descent into Birmingham.
Yeah, this couple come down from duluth.
We was talking them down the short-term mortgages.
And I'm figuring, "gee, Andy, you're gonna unload this Turkey."
Well, and a squad car rolls up, and they start asking questions.
Then the good old boys give 'em the whole grand tour -- who was lying where, and what.
Terrific.
So, they get in their sedan deville and get the hell out of here.
Any single men ask to see the house?
Haven't asked me.
You used a cutting tool on the branch, so that you could see.
Then you passed the time whittling and dreaming.
When night came, you saw them pass by their bright windows.
Then you watched the shades go down, then you saw the lights go out, one by one.
Then, after a while, you climbed down and you went in to them, didn't ya?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You watched them all goddamned day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
I need the firearms and tool marks section out here on a severed branch.
I need to know what kind of cutting tool he used.
And then I need bowman in documents to fall on this carving.
- Is it weird?
- The mark?
Yeah.
If documents can't do the carving, I'll send it up to Langley.
Did price get an identification off the Leeds print?
No, price hasn't found him in the index yet.
It's a hand search.
He's got half his department on it.
Listen will, have you seen this week's tattler?
It's not on my preferred reading list, Jack.
Yeah, well, uh, your picture's all over the front page.
Who the hell was it?
Lounds?
Of course.
Who else?
God damn it, Jack!
I promised Molly!
I promised her!
Come in.
- Dr. chilton?
- Yes?
When we were cleaning out Dr. lecktor's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book.
We got him out of there and dug around.
- Is that it?
- Yes.
Put it down on my desk, bonner.
Has anyone else seen this except you?
No.
Special agent Crawford's office.
This is Dr. chilton.
I need to speak to Mr. Graham right away.
He's not here, he's in Birmingham.
Special agent Crawford is on the line with him now.
Will you please tell them this is very, very urgent.
I'll hold on.
Dr. chilton, it's Jack Crawford.
You have will Graham on the line, too.
I have a note, or two pieces of a note that appears to be from that man who killed those people in Atlanta.
Dr. chilton, where did you get it?
In Hannibal lecktor's cell.
It was hidden in a book.
Dr. chilton, don't touch the note.
Can you read it to us?
It's written on toilet tissue.
"My dear Dr. lecktor, i wanted to tell you
I am delighted that you've taken an interest in me.
I know that you alone can understand what I am becoming.
You alone know the people I use to help me in these things are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming, just as the source of light is burning.
I have a collection of your press clippings.
I think they are absurd, as are mine.
'The tooth fairy,' what could be more inappropriate?
Investigator Graham interests me, very purposeful-looking.
I hope we can correspond."
Mr. Graham, there's a piece missing here.
Now I'll read the bottom part.
"After I hear back from you,
I might send you something wet."
Signed "avid fan".
It has teeth marks pressed into it at the bottom.
Sarah, order a chopper, next thing smoking.
I don't care whose it is.
Two, call Alabama air national guard and tell 'em to get Graham back here right now.
Then call documents and tell them to scramble a team.
I want everybody moving five minutes ago.
You understand?
I have a documents team on its way to you by helicopter to pick up the note.
Listen, after we've worked the note,
I want to replace it in lecktor's cell.
I don't want lecktor to know that we've found it.
He might try to warn the killer somehow.
- Where's lecktor now?
- Holding cell.
How long can you keep him in there without him getting suspicious?
Three, four hours.
Brian, we have a note coming in on the flight, possibly from the tooth fairy, number one priority.
It has to go to hair and fiber, latent prints, and then documents.
Will Graham and i will be walking it through.
One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.
- And a couple of blue grains.
- Work the hair.
Do we have the negative comparison?
Hair from lecktor's comb, whiskers from lecktor's razor they let him use.
This is, uh, hair from the security guard.
How many guys handled this without gloves?
The guard, cleanup man, lecktor.
The cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had the oil washed off his fingers.
But the others...
One smudge.
Those aren't ridges.
It's just the texture of the paper.
I can fume for a print, but can't guarantee the iodine stains would fade out.
- Ninhydrin?
Boost it with heat?
- No.
We couldn't wash it after.
I can't get a print off this in the time you've got to get it back, will.
- How long do I have?
- Twenty minutes, Max.
The main thing to find out is, how was lecktor supposed to reply to him?
Which is probably the missing section, because at the top it says, "i hope we can correspond,"
then comes the gap.
This note was written in ballpoint, but it looks like lecktor went over this area with a felt-tip pen, then tore it away.
You're so sly, but so am I.
The aniline dyes used in the ink of the felt-tip pens, like lecktor used, are transparent to infrared.
The tooth fairy's ballpoint isn't.
This looks like the tip of a t here, here, and here.
At the end is what could be the top of an r.
There's three ts and an r in "tattler".
We know our boy reads it.
The article about me and lecktor.
I don't know anybody else that's carried that.
Personal ads.
We believe the tooth fairy told lecktor to reply to him through the personal ad section of the national tattler.
The Chicago office is down there right now running through their ads.
We have cut into a line of communication between the tooth fairy and lecktor.
If we find lecktor's reply, we plan to pull it, substitute it with one of our own.
And this is what the tooth fairy will read.
Bill?
"Dear avid fan, inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements.
Mementoes for you at Baltimore central left luggage.
Ticket number 72683."
It's a secret service letter drop.
We plan to stake it out.
When he shows, we'll grab him.
Anything from Chicago?
- Not yet.
- When do they go to press?
Thirty-five minutes.
- Christ.
- Let's get to the physical.
There was no print.
Scale counts and core size of the hair match the blond hair found in the jacobis'.
That note was written by your man.
Aside from the hair, three blue grains, dark flecks, went to Brian's end.
The grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine, from the cleaning man.
Several particles of dried blood, but not enough to type.
This is Chester.
Who am I talking to?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford.
Got a personal ad with "avid fan" in it being telexed to you right now.
- Read it.
- "Dear avid fan, you honor me.
You're very beautiful."
Jack".
Oh, Christ.
"I offer 100 prayers for your safety.
Find help in galatians 6:11, 15:2, acts 3:3, revelations 18:7,
Jonah 6:8, John 6:22,
Luke 1:7."
Jack".
Thanks.
Jimmy, did you get anywhere at all identifying him off the Leeds' prints?
Not yet.
Photography at Langley?
They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.
No.
And our ad has to go out in the same book code lecktor used, or he'll know it wasn't lecktor talking to him.
Book code?
"100 prayers" could be the page number, the paired numbers could be line and letter.
But what book?
- Not the Bible?
- No.
Galatians 15:2.
Galatians only has six chapters.
The same with Jonah 6:8.
Jonah only has four chapters.
Lecktor was not using the Bible.
Then the tooth fairy probably named the book in the part lecktor tore out.
Right.
What about sweating lecktor?
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.
Gave them a recipe for potato chip clip.
Wonderful.
The tooth fairy would have named a book he knew lecktor has access to.
He'd know it from articles he'd read about lecktor.
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took polaroids so they can get everything back in place.
Have him meet me with pictures of lecktor's books.
- Where?
- Library of congress.
Twenty-five minutes.
He won't make it in time.
Lecktor's ad runs as is, we decode it later.
Or... we pull it, figure out the code, and run our own ad next week.
And lose a week?
We got 17 days till the next full moon.
And I don't like lecktor's ad runnin' without knowing what it says.
It's your call, will.
Run it.
And what if it encourages the tooth fairy to do something else beside write?
We'll all feel sick for a very long time.
And if bowman still can't figure it out?
Then we'll bait him with something else in next week's tattler.
What, for instance?
Me.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
Why not?
Don't you think we can provoke him?
Maybe.
Maybe he can be provoked.
What I was thinking about is you.
You're getting deeper and deeper into this.
Good night.
Sidney.
I'll talk to you, will.
Okay?
Last time you did that you did a real good job of pushing yourself all out of shape.
You try it on again or you go through some big trauma, you could relapse, my friend.
Sidney, don't worry about me.
I'm working the evidence, making moves.
That's all.
I'm fine.
Bowman just struck out.
- It is not books in lecktor's cell.
- Price?
He just heard.
It's a bust-out.
As evidence, the Leeds print will get us a conviction if we could ever find the guy.
But he must never have been printed because he is not in our index.
We are not gonna identify him off the print.
I'll use lounds.
What for?
Our boy doesn't read the new York times literary supplement.
He reads lounds in the tattler.
What else should we cover?
He put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.
I believe he did this to make sure we wouldn't think he was gay.
He's molested all of his male victims.
He may be impotent with members of the opposite sex.
Our forensic psychologists have projected, though I'm not sure, that he may have had sexual relations with his mother.
So, how long do you plan to stay in Washington?
Till we've taken out the tooth fairy.
Can the tattler rely on gettin' the straight stuff from you?
Absolutely.
How does working on this case affect your sex life?
Mine?
It doesn't affect mine, it affects yours.
Go fuck yourself.
- Look, pal of mine, you're news.
- Shoot the pictures.
All right, stimy, let's shoot 'em.
I'm in the shots with Graham.
- What?
- I'm in the shots with you.
Come on, you want this to look real or not?
Make sure the theater sign across the street is just slightly out of focus.
We want him to be able to read it so he can find it, but we don't want to look too obvious.
You make sure that I look excellent.
All right, shoot it.
One more.
- One more.
- That's enough.
Okay, Graham.
Hey, always nice, huh?
Let's have lunch, call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.
Dr. bloom.
I need them on my desk in two hours.
Okay?
- Did bowman break the code yet?
- No.
Tools and firearms say the cutting tool used on the severed branch was a common bolt cutter.
I got a call from Asian studies at Langley.
- The mark you found on the tree?
- Yeah?
It's a Chinese character considered a lucky sign in gambling.
That same character appears on a mah jongg piece.
It means "red dragon".
Mean anything to you?
No.
I'm having the bureau fly Molly up tonight.
Huh?
Well, she said she can get away for one night.
I do something wrong?
No, it's just the setting, Jack.
- Hm.
- Thanks.
If he shows, and he's smart, he'll approach you from the front, pass, turn, try and take you from behind.
- How's your hearing?
- It's good.
You'll wear a wire, one-way.
We'll hear you, you won't hear us.
You checked out a charter arms .44 special bulldog?
Yeah.
Load these in it.
You ever fire 'em?
- Glaser safety slugs.
- Yeah.
Number 12 shots.
Suspended in liquid teflon in a copper casing.
On impact it all opens up in the target.
Guaranteed one-shot stop.
- You got body armor?
- Yeah, kevlar second chance.
I hope you get one.
'Cause he's gone for the head shot eight out of eleven times?
Let's walk the route.
United flight 849 to Newark is now boarding at gate 7.
United flight 849 to Newark is now boarding at gate 7.
You didn't cancel the food.
So, where are things?
We got nine days left.
We're working on it, doing stuff.
You don't want to talk about what you're doing, do you?
Hotel rooms...
Illicit romance.
We have to stop meeting like this.
Remember the first time we met?
Yeah.
When we were alone together in that room.
Even though I'd never seen you before, we were sitting there, speaking.
And something flickered across your face like a shadow.
I said, "what's that?"
Mm-hmm.
Remember what you said?
I said, "this is too good to live."
Time is luck, will.
I know the value of every single day.
Someone's coming.
Go!
Don't!
Don't move!
Take the money!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
- Clear!
- Clear!
What you moving in slow motion for, man?
I'm being mugged!
For real.
Can you believe that?
Pay up- ...in sports, the cubs lost again.
Hey!
You know who I am?
Mm-hm.
I don't want to know who you are.
According to you, I'm a sexual pervert.
"An animal," you said.
You know who I am now?
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Open your eyes.
Mr. lounds, you're a reporter.
Your job is to report.
That's why you're here.
And if you don't open your eyes,
I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Well... here I... am.
Look at the screen.
William Blake's the great red dragon and the woman clothed in the rays of the sun.
- Do you see?
- Yes.
Mrs. Leeds.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. jacobi.
Do you see?
Yes.
The next family as they will look when I go to visit them.
- Do you see?
- Yes.
Freddie lounds, your photograph.
- No.
- No, what?
No.
Not me, please.
- Please.
- Are you a man?
Yes.
Do you imply that I'm queer?
God, no.
Before me, you are a slug in the sun.
You are privy to a great...
Becoming, and you recognize nothing.
You are an ant in the afterbirth.
It is your nature to do one thing correctly, tremble.
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, lounds, you and the others, you owe me awe.
We have one more piece of work to do.
If he takes off the mask, i am a dead man.
Open your eyes.
- Open your eyes!
- Ah.
You will read this...
In the tape recorder.
Go.
"I have had a great privilege.
I have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the red dragon.
All I wrote about him were lies.
Will Graham made me write them to pull him into a trap in Washington, district of Columbia.
Will Graham, you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread because I was forced to lie.
He will be more merciful to me than to you.
You will lie awake in fear of what the red dragon will do.
I will be a testament to the truth of this."
You did very well.
Will you let me go now?
Please?
You will tell the truth?
I promise.
Good.
We'll seal your promise with...
We'll seal your promise with a kiss.
Man on radio".
We'll be showing five possible answers to the questions I'll be asking.
Any member of a team may buzz in an answer, but if incorrect, then the other team will have the opportunity to answer that very same question.
The team with the most points at the end of three rounds will compete and win will also compete in the right to enter diamondhead in our fourth and final round.
Uh, questions in round number one are gonna be worth 10 points each.
Okay, that means the round is all over.
So, Jane we're all ready.
Help us with round one.
All right, Bob, the first category today is the far east.
And the choices are Vietnam, Japan, Laos, Thailand, and China.
Bowman, just skip the cryptography and tell me what the hell it says, okay?
- Did he try to say anything at all?
- No, he sure didn't.
He never regained consciousness.
- Did you hear the tape?
- Yeah.
Listen, bowman just broke the code that lecktor used in the tattler personal ad.
It was the state of Maryland statutes.
You need to know what it said right now.
- What?
- Listen to me.
Everything is okay.
I've taken care of it.
What is it, Jack?
The bastard gave him your home address.
It said, "Graham home, 3860 desoto highway, captiva, Florida.
Save yourself.
Kill them all."
- Get me a plane.
- Will!
Will.
Will.
Mom.
Huh?
What time... what?
S-someone's outside.
They're noises.
- Where?
- Outside.
Mom...
Go back to your room and close the door.
- Mom...
- Do it, now.
Ma'am, are you all right?
What?
What is it?
What is it?
What's going on?
Ma'am, I think you should come back inside.
- What's going on?
- Come back inside.
Please.
I think you should come back inside.
I'm sorry, Molly.
I'm sorry about all of this.
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.
He's after you now, isn't he?
It's just a precaution.
Kevin, why don't you run down to the water, check out the clock?
I want to hang around here.
- I'm in the kitchen, mom.
- Okay.
What is that about?
What, he's afraid to leave you alone with me now?
He saw the article in the tattler, right?
I wanted to talk with him about it, but he said he wanted to bring it up to you, face to face.
Good for him.
Kevin, come on, help me unpack, will ya?
Then we'll go get some groceries.
You and mom are very well-protected, you know.
No one's gonna find out where you are.
Is there anything i need to know to see about mom?
No.
This guy is trying to kill us?
We don't know that.
When are you going to kill him?
I'm not.
It's only my job to find him.
Barry's mom had this newspaper.
It said you were in a special hospital.
Well, it was a regular hospital, then I was transferred into the psychiatric wing.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
I don't know.
Was it because in the papers it said it was this man lecktor?
Mm-hm.
What happened?
Well, lecktor was attacking college girls, then he killed them.
How?
In bad ways.
He was a psychiatrist.
One of the girls was his patient, and I went to talk to him about her.
I tried to build feelings in my imagination like the killer had so that I would know why he did what he did, because that would help me find him.
When I was sitting in lecktor's office and I looked up,
I saw a book on his shelf.
It had pictures of war wounds in it.
And I knew it was him.
So I went to a pay phone down the hall to call the police, and that's when he attacked me.
You and mom, came to see me in the hospital, and that helped a lot.
But after my body got okay,
I still had his thoughts going around in my head.
And I stopped talking to people.
And a doctor friend of mine, a Dr. bloom, asked me to get some help.
And I did.
Then after a while, I felt better, and I was okay again.
And the way he thought felt that bad?
Kevin, they're the ugliest thoughts in the world.
So, what kind of coffee do you like?
Huh?
You like that folgers stuff, right?
Yeah.
Mom likes that, too.
When can we go home, dad?
I don't know, Kevin.
So, where are things?
Nowhere.
Everything we've tried is either a dead end or it's backfired.
Crawford's already planning the next crime scene so that we get it fresh.
We've got about six more days till the next full moon.
Can you quit?
No.
What's next?
- I go to Atlanta.
- Crawford?
No.
I have to be alone.
You're talking about doing exactly what you said you...
This killing, it's gotta stop.
William, you're gonna make yourself sick or get yourself killed.
You and Kevin should go to Montana.
Go see your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.
And I'll come up and get you afterwards.
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry I can't come to the phone right now.
- I'm sorry, too.
- Excuse me.
Coffee.
It's just you and me now, sport.
I'm gonna find you, god damn it.
- Mr. dollarhyde?
- Ah, Eileen.
Bill told me to tell you there was a variation in the gamma of number three.
But he caught it in time.
Eileen, uh...
Good.
Good.
- Who's there?
- Mr. dollarhyde.
I came about the low-light infrared emulsion.
Oh, yeah.
Come on in, it's safe.
Put your back against the door.
And there's a stool just to your right.
You're the production controller from admin, right?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions?
Um, shooting from maybe eight feet.
- I can't use any lights.
Mm-hm.
Okay, what's being photographed?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
Four days.
Okay, let me stick this in the black hole.
1000-c infrared sensitive has to be handled in total darkness.
Remember to be very careful with it.
But still, it's easier to handle than the 1200 series.
It'll be fine.
In case you're wondering,
I keep the samples straight by touch code.
I-i wasn't wondering.
Reba, I gotta fly.
Maybe Mr. dollarhyde can drive you home tonight?
No, that's okay.
I'll take care of myself.
- I can change things around.
- No, thanks, go on.
Okay.
- No, I'll take you.
- No, thanks.
I'll order you 1200 feet of 1000-c in the morning.
- Ride with me.
- Thanks, but I'll take the bus.
I do it all the time.
Ride with me.
It would be because i would like you to.
Okay, sure.
Let me get my stuff on.
How did you come to gateway?
Oh, they had to hire the handicapped to shape up their employment practices to get this defense contract.
You worked out well.
Yeah, well, everybody they hired did.
You know, you speak very well.
Although you avoid fricatives and sibilants.
At the riker institute for the blind,
I trained in therapy for speech- and hearing-impaired children.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Mm-hm.
You know, if you don't want to talk, that's okay.
But I hope you will, because you're very direct, and I like that, and I like what you have to say.
May I touch your face?
I want to know whether you're smiling or frowning.
I guess I...
I guess I want to know whether I should be quiet or not.
Take my word for it.
I'm smiling.
I didn't mean to offend you.
On the way, can I take you somewhere?
Where?
It would be my surprise.
Okay, sure.
- Are you apprehensive?
- No.
The very protective Mr. dollarhyde over there is watching us.
No, no, I want to.
In about two hours, we're going to cap his tooth.
Yeah.
It's warm.
Back a little bit.
There.
- You hear it?
- Yeah.
You... rearrange the dead families into an audience to see what you do.
You think that what you do will make you into something different.
You are becoming.
What is it you think you're becoming?
The answer is in the way you use the mirrors.
What do the mirrors make you dream you're becoming?
A little to your left.
Francis, that was a great dinner.
Thank you.
I made you a gin and tonic.
It's right in front of you.
Oh.
What are you watching?
Oh, it's just a little homework.
Mmm.
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, d.
# Is there a fire in the sky?
#
Your heart's loud.
# Is there a moon up there?
#
If you'll hold me...
# Is anything alive now?
#
# This darkness is what I hear # # this is a breathless silence # # a moment out of time #
# I see your face in the shadows # # the tell-tale signs are in your eyes # # aching with a passion inside #
# deep as the river # # all desire # # the ashes and the fire # # turning this night inside # # and the light from you #
# is there a flame in the dark?
#
# Is there a bright heart star?
#
# These creatures look the same now # # we freeze wherever we are #
# we wake alone in the blackness I # we sleep wherever we fall # # one dream all around us # # this big hush infects us all #
# forever in this half-light # # all desire # # the ashes and the fire # # turning this night inside #
# and the light from you # # all desire # # the ashes and the fire # # turning this night inside # # and the light from you #
- Is that you, d?
- Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Well, you know, if you show me where things are,
I'll make us some coffee.
No, no, uh...
- Don't go back inside the house.
- Why?
I left my purse inside.
I'll get it.
It's okay.
# Deep as the river # # all... #
I mean, you should stay outside, it's...
It's 'cause you look so good in the sun.
Okay.
Um...
When, uh...
Reba, when can I see you again?
Oh, um...
Hey, we could meet at my house.
You got the message lecktor called?
Yeah.
I arranged for him to have a phone.
I gotta call him in a few minutes.
Good.
Listen, we identified the tire tracks left when lounds was delivered back to the tattler.
G-7816 goodyear truck tires.
Looks like our boy drives a Van.
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you coming back?
When I'm done, Jack.
Yeah, this is will Graham of the FBI.
Dr. chilton arranged for me to talk to Dr. lecktor.
Hello?
Hello, will.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. lounds.
I admire that enormously.
Oh, what a cunning boy you are, will.
I'm sick of you crazy sons of bitches, lecktor.
You got something to say, say it.
Lecktor".
I want to help you.
You'd be more comfortable if you relax with yourself.
We don't invent our natures, they're issued to us, along with our lungs, and pancreas, and everything else.
Why fight it?
Fight what?
Did you really feel so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob hobbs to death?
I didn't know you then, but I think you probably did.
But it wasn't the act that got you down, was it?
Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?
And why shouldn't it feel good?
It must feel good to god.
He does it all the time.
God's terrific.
He dropped a church roof on 34 of his worshippers last Wednesday night in Texas as they were groveling through a hymn to his majesty.
Don't you think that felt good?
Why does it feel good, Dr. lecktor?
It feels good, will, because god has power.
And if one does what god does enough times, one will become as god is.
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.
He got 140 filipinos in one plane crash last month.
Remember that earthquake in Italy last spring?
I enter.
The glass cutter.
The piece of glass I take out is mine.
The house is mine.
I walk up these stairs,
I pass the children's toys.
Children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.
I move to the door.
I step into the room.
I see you there.
And I see me desired by you.
Accepted and loved in the silver mirrors of your eyes.
# Father, look in my eyes # # see me as I really am #
# you made me # # now take me #
I'm gonna talk to fogel tomorrow...
# Tell me how it feels now # # behold your flesh has come of age #
Wait a minute.
# Forsake me, you break me # # strong as I am # # there's something about this thing that scares me # # strong as I am # # there's something about this thing that dares me #
# strong as I am # # there's something about this thing that haunts me # # strong as I am # # there's something about this thing that taunts me #
# mother, let me heal you # # your pain has lasted far too long #
# release it, it kills you #
What was it?
- Pollen.
- Oh.
- Thanks for the ride.
- See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
# Your love you would not share #
Mr. dollarhyde.
What are you doing here?
# Strong as I am # # there's something about this thing that scares me # # strong as I am #
- Who is it?
- It's me.
- Who?
Who is it?
- It's me.
Oh.
- Francis?
Knob-i not Francis.
Francis is gone.
Francis is gone forever.
So, what are we doing?
The dream.
He dreams about being wanted and desired, so he changes people into beings who want and desire him.
- Changes?
- It's a word.
Killing and arranging the people to imitate it.
And lecktor told me something.
If one does what god does enough times, one will become as god is.
You put it together, you get, if our boy imitates being wanted and desired enough times, he believes he will become one who is wanted, and desired, and accepted.
It'll all come true.
But he doesn't take anything.
There's no souvenirs taken from the houses.
He needs souvenirs or trophies to re-live the event.
Maybe he records it somehow...
So he could see himself accepted over, and over, and over again.
Vtrs, polaroids, stills, what?
How do I know?
How does he find 'em?
When we find out how he found them, we'll find him.
There is no connection between the two families.
We've clone a dozen computer runs.
Jack, all the women have a bloom on them.
He didn't win them in a lottery, he picked these women.
There's selection and design in his choices.
Look, admit we struck out this month.
The lear jet is standing by, the basic lab stuff is on it.
You, zeller, Jimmy price, the photographer, anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and 15 minutes.
We get the call, we roll.
The scene will be fresh, fresher than we've ever had it.
- It's not over yet.
- Oh, for Christ's sake!
It's a foregone conclusion.
It's 11:30 P.M., the full moon is happening tonight.
Give it up!
Forget this month, it's too damn late!
I gave it up.
Till you showed up with pictures of two dead families, knowing goddamn well that I'd imagine families three, four, five, and six, right?
You're fucking right I did, and I'd do it again!
Great!
But don't talk to me about late, pal.
I'll tell you when it's too fucking late!
Until then, we go as late as I want to take it!
A padlock.
That's why the bolt cutter.
What's that?
He used a bolt cutter to trim away the branch when he was watching from the woods.
Why didn't he use the bolt cutter on the garage door?
Because a deadbolt was there when they were killed.
Donald jacobi's 12th birthday party was April 14.
Sometime between April 14 and August 1 they changed the lock.
But he thought there was a padlock there.
From the street, you can't see the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door.
There's a big, high fence there.
But he was ready with his glass cutter.
So either he was casing far ahead and we didn't check back far enough,
or!
- We checked.
- Don't talk.
Metcalfe, it's Graham.
Is the Leeds and jacobi stuff still in the storeroom?
Have the guard down there call me.
Do it.
You know that's the jacobis' cat.
You brought a bolt cutter 'cause you thought there was a padlock.
The Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog, don't you, my man?
See the woman?
The bloom on the woman?
You can see her again and again anytime you want.
Doggie doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog.
And the jacobi cat.
And the padlock on the door.
And you know you need a bolt cutter and every other goddamn thing because everything with you is seeing, isn't it?
Your primary sensory intake that makes your dream live is seeing.
Reflections, mirrors, images...
You've seen these films.
Haven't you, my man?
It's the guard in the storeroom.
- The cans.
- What cans?
The tapes were transferred from home movies.
Where's the packaging the films came in?
There's films of the families in the document storage.
Find them.
You got 'em?
Are there any labels?
Leeds can, gateway lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
The jacobi label will say the same thing as the Leeds label.
Gateway lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
Who processed the jacobi film?
No.
Bob's photo store, Birmingham.
Stores send them out.
Have him peel the top label back.
Is there a label underneath?
It does, doesn't it?
Where are you?
Are you here?
You're scaring me with this!
Will you just stop it?
Francis, why are you doing this to me?
It's ugly!
# Don't you know that I'll always be true?
#
Are you in this room?
Where are you?
You answer me!
# And take my hand # # oh, won't you come with me # # and walk this land?
#
# Please, take my hand #
We're looking for a man.
We know he works at gateway.
We don't have his name, but we know he drives a Van.
Under "employee facilities,"
I've got special stickers for vans.
Yeah, I got 28, 29 Van permits in the computer.
Start feeding me names.
Is this lieutenant fisk?
Will Graham.
Listen, I need you to punch up the driver's licenses of the names I'm gonna feed you.
The man we're looking for is blond, Caucasian, 20 to 40 years old, over six feet tall, 180 to 225 pounds.

Fogel has four more names.
He knows two, both dark hair, third's a woman, fourth is a handicapped parking permit.
This is our man.
Rural route 3, Chester, Missouri.
Where is that?
From the airport, you're a few minutes closer.
We're 10-25 at the hark road off ramp, highway 94.
Let's
- meet point's up ahead.
- Go on to the house.
- But lieutenant fisk said...
- Go on to the house.
Will?
Will?
You're not gonna need that.
A SWAT team is gonna take him down, not us.
Will?
Will!
This ought to be it right here.
Kill your lights.
- You all right?
- I'm okay.
Griffin's hurt bad.
I'll wait for the backup.
Set up a roadblock on route 3.
Graham and I are in the trees west of the house.
How far away is the backup unit?
I'm going around the back.
Stay in the trees.
He's in there, Jack.
And he's got somebody in there with him.
What?
Will, what did you say?
Will.
Wait for the backup, will.
Will!
He's got somebody in the house with him, Jack.
Will.
Stop it.
Stop it!

We're okay, yeah.
Yeah, we're doing all right.
Thanks.
Listen, um, that guy Crawford called and he was telling me all about -- would you like to come in and have a cup of coffee or a drink?
- No, thank you.
- Listen, I want --
I just stopped by to, uh...
Listen, I want --
I want to thank you.
I-i...
I just stopped by... to see you.
That's all.

We should've talked at the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk about it here.
I'm not falling all over myself to talk about it much of anywhere, Jack.
How much do you know?
Not much.
The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago.
The second one in Atlanta was all over TV.
Did you ever think about giving me a call?
No.
Why not?
I quit.
Remember?
You look all right now.
I am all right.
If you can't look anymore, I understand.
Don't try to run a game down on me, Jack.
If I really didn't need you to come back, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks and a few days until the next full moon.
We have a better chance to get him fast if you help.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
Hi, Molly.
Think it'll keep them out, Dad?
Yep.
How many turtle eggs do you think are in here?
In this hatchery?
I'll bet there's 40 or 50 of them.
Crabs get most of the newborns, huh?
Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it, guaranteed.
What about the dogs?
Are they gonna get in here?
They can't dig under.
That's why we bury the wire down in the sand.
We need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be his friend, Jack.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, Molly,
I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.
We got it pretty good, don't we?
We have it more than good.
All that happened to you before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only look at evidence.
I wouldn't get deeply involved.
He'd never even see me or know my name.
If they find him, they'll have to take him down, not me.
What do you think?
I think you've already decided and you're not really asking.
If I were asking?
Stay here with me, me and Kevin.
But it's selfish, and I know it.
Come here.
I'll come inside with you, if you want, to show you around.
Mr. Crawford said maybe you'd want to be alone, but...
That's right.
There's a VCR hooked up in your hotel room.
They transferred some home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen sliding door.
Used a glass cutter anchored to a suction cup.
His entry was skillful.
All the prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair, strong, size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood AB positive, typed from saliva on glass from licking the suction cup.
Why didn't he care that he left saliva on the glass?
It was hot out that night, so inside the house must have felt cool to him.
Intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he was rising, then shot Mrs. Leeds.
Bullet entered right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation.
Moderate elevation of serotonin and marked increase of free histamine level in gunshot wound indicates she lived at least five minutes after she was shot.
All her other injuries were post-mortem.
Direction and velocity of bloodstains on east wall indicate arterial spray.
Even with his throat cut, Leeds tried to fight because the intruder was moving to the children's room.
Bloodstains on west wall of master bedroom and matted sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained,
as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leeds' chest, also believed to be post-mortem.
What did the killer do with them after they were dead?
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry, I can't come to the phone right now, but if you'd like to leave a message please do so after the beep, and I'll call you back as soon as I can.
Twenty-ninth floor.
Going up.
When they were dead, he smashed the mirrors and began selecting pieces that he would use later on Mrs. Leeds.
Killing Mr. Leeds and the children would take less than a minute.
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem, four or five minutes later.
What did he do in the interval?
The smeared bloodstains on the west wall...
Hello?
Molly?
Will, is that you?
Yeah, it's me, honey.
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
I love you.
I love you too, baby.
What are you dreaming?
That's something you can't afford for me to know about, isn't it?
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
It was maddening to have to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg, but there wasn't any talcum powder in the bathroom.
The talcum powder came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You touched her with your bare hands, and then you put your gloves back on.
But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so that they could see you?
Hello?
Jack, this is Graham.
Is Price still in Latent Prints?
Yeah, he's in charge of the Single Print Index now.
What do you got, Will?
Get him to Atlanta.
Atlanta PD swears they dusted everything, and their guy is pretty good.
He is good.
He's not as good as Price.
I'll get him on a plane in the morning.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails and the corneas of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves.
Our people swear he wore surgeon's gloves the whole time.
They dusted everything.
Your report didn't mention eyes.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
Because Mrs. Leeds was a beautiful woman.
This is what the subject's teeth looked like.
The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed these from the impressions that we took of the bite marks on the Leeds woman here and the Jacobi woman in Birmingham last month.
As you can see, he has pegged lateral incisors, that's these teeth here and here.
Vice and Narcotics, you take the K-Y cowboys and leather bars.
Marcus, Whitman, heads up at the funeral.
The rest of your assignments are on the sheet.
Let's go.
One more thing.
I've heard officers referring to this killer as the Tooth Fairy.
ALL LAUGHING)
Well, I don't want to hear that in public, and I don't want to see it in internal memoranda.
That's it.
I know a burglar's gonna fence what he stole 'cause his motive is cash money.
I know his motive, so I go to work on fences.
This guy, we don't even have motive.
None of us have shit, and we know it.
It's in his dreams.
His motive?
Yeah.
His act fuels his fantasy.
Which is?
I don't know.
The commissioner was saying that you're the one who got Garrett Jacob Hobbs, and then Dr. Lecktor three years ago.
Lecktor killed nine people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
One's on a respirator at a hospital in Baltimore, the other's in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
The psychologists call him a psychopath.
They don't know what else to call him.
I understand he cut you pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's.
The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen.
The Jacobis in Birmingham had a cat, didn't they?
That's right.
We found a litter box downstairs, but we didn't find a cat.
Why don't you get Birmingham PD a methane probe out of Washington, have them cover the back yard.
Maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
Yeah?
This is Jimmy Price, FBI.
Let me put you on speakerphone.
Who am I talking to?
Jimmy, it's Jack Crawford.
You got Will Graham here, too.
I got a partial print with a tented arch, it's probably a thumb.
And the fragment of a palm off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.
Thumbprint came off the oldest kid's left eye.
It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.
Can we make an identification off of it?
Maybe, if he's ever been printed and he's in my index.
I want to work these up in my own darkroom.
I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon.
Thanks, Jimmy.
No comment.
If we get lucky with that print, we're in, if Jimmy can find him in the index and if he's ever been printed.
If not, I don't know.
Hey, Will Graham!
What do you say?
You remember me?
Freddie Lounds, covered the Lecktor case for the Tattler, did the paperback.
So, Will, when did they call you in?
What do you got?
Hey, look, I'm buying lunch.
Lounds, why don't you give it a rest?
Hey, he's news.
I'm doing my job.
So, how does this guy compare with Lecktor?
How does he do them?
How's he do them, Will?
Keep the fuck away from me.
Will, Will.
Son of a bitch snuck into the hospital while I was sedated after Lecktor.
He pulled back the sheets, and he took pictures.
Yeah, I know.
Look, don't expect too much from me, all right?
We only got three weeks left, and you're our best shot.
You think I'm gonna see him standing in the street and say, "There he is"?
That's Houdini you're thinking about.
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on until we get smart or get lucky.
He won't stop.
Why?
He's got a genuine taste for it.
You do know something about him.
Not enough.
I think I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mindset.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Yeah, I keep getting it for Christmas.
Did you get my card?
I got it.
Thank you.
How is Officer Stewart?
The one who was first to see my basement.
Stewart's fine.
Emotional problems, I hear.
Do you have any problems, Will?
No.
No, of course you don't.
I'm glad you came.
My callers are mostly clinical psychologists from cornfield universities somewhere.
Second-raters, the lot.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
And?
Very interesting.
Even to a layman.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Yes, I thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Yes?
You read about it?
In the papers.
I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
I thought you might have some ideas.
Why should I tell you?
You'd get to see the file on this case.
And there's another reason.
Pray tell.
Thought you might be curious to see if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
Then by implication you think you're smarter than me, since you caught me.
No.
I know that I'm not smarter than you.
Then how did you catch me?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantages?
You're insane.
You are very tan, Will.
Your hands are rough.
They don't look like cop's hands anymore.
And that shaving lotion is something a child would select.
It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it?
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
I don't think I'll persuade you at all.
You'll either do it or you won't.
Besides, we have Dr. Bloom working on it, and he's the best.
Do you have the file with you?
Yes.
Pictures?
Yes.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
No.
Dream much, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file, and I'll tell you what I think.
This is a very shy boy, Will.
What were their yards like?
Big back yards.
Fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, my dear Will, if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he might go outside to look at it.
Have you ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy for this sort of thing.
That's interesting.
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.
I considered it.
You came here to look at me, to get the old scent back again, didn't you?
I want your opinion.
I don't have one right now.
Well, when you have one, I'd like to hear it.
Can I keep this?
I haven't decided yet.
I'll study them.
When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too.
You can call me.
When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone.
Would you like to leave me your home phone number?
No.
Do you know how you caught me?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You can leave messages for me.
Do you know how you caught me?
The reason you caught me, Will, is we're just alike.
Do you understand?
Smell yourself.
Gotcha.
217 now boarding at Gate 12.
Eastern Airlines Flight 217 is now ready for boarding at Gate 12.
Get up against the bunk and face the wall.
Don't turn around, or I'll Mace you in the face.
Thank you so much.
I'll call you when I'm finished.
Are you ready for your call?
Yes, thank you.
Paltrow, Christiansen Golub,LawOffices.
Excuse me.
I must have misdialed.
Thank you for using ATT.
This is Operator 24.
Operator, I don't have the use of my arms.
Would you be so kind as to dial a number for me, please?
Certainly.
What's the number?
Area code 301, 555-6624.
The University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry.
Dr. Sidney Bloom, please.
He's not in, but I'll connect you to his office.
What's his secretary's name again?
Martha King.
Just a moment, please.
Martha King's desk.
Hi, Martha.
Martha doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob Greer of Blaine Edwardspublishingcompany,
Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of The Psychiatrist and the Law to someone.
Martha never sent me the address and phone number.
She'll be in in the morning.
Well, I've got to catch Federal Express in about five minutes.
I'd be immensely appreciative if you could pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
I don't see a Rolodex.
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Yeah...
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
All right.
The name we're looking for, last name Graham, the man the book is supposed to be sent to, a Mr. Will Graham.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, 10th and Pennsylvania,
Washington, D.C.
Now, I'll bet it has his home address there, too.
3680 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida.
Thank you so very much.
I've finished.
Mom!
Oh, my gosh.
It's all right.
Stewardess!
Ladies and gentlemen, we are beginning our descent into Birmingham.
You used a cutting tool on the branch so that you could see.
Then you passed the time whittling and dreaming.
When night came, you saw them pass by their bright windows.
Then you watched the shades go down, then you saw the lights go out, one by one.
Then after a while, you climbed down and you went in to them, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You watched them all goddamned day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
I need Firearms and Tool Marks section out here on a severed branch.
I need to know what kind of cutting tool he used.
And then I need Bowman in Documents to fall on this carving.
Is it weird?
The mark?
Yeah.
If Documents can't do the carving, I'll send it up to Langley.
Did Price get an identification off the Leeds print?
No, Price hasn't found him in the index yet.
It's a hand search.
He's got half his department on it.
Listen, have you seen this week's Tattler?
It's not on my preferred reading list.
Well, your picture's all over the front page.
Who the hell was it?
Lounds?
Of course.
Who else?
God damn it, Jack!
I promised Molly!
I promised her!
Come in.
Dr. Chilton?
Yes?
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lecktor's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book.
We got him out of there and dug around.
Is that it?
Yes.
Put it down on my desk, Bonner.
Has anyone else seen this except you?
No.
Special Agent Crawford's office.
This is Dr. Chilton.
I need to speak to Mr. Graham right away.
He's not here, he's in Birmingham.
Special Agent Crawford is on the line with him now.
Please tell them this is very, very urgent.
I'll hold on.
Dr. Chilton, it's Jack Crawford.
You have Will Graham on the line, too.
I have a note, or two pieces of a note that appears to be from that man who killed those people in Atlanta.
Where did you get it?
In Hannibal Lecktor's cell.
It was hidden in a book.
Don't touch the note.
Can you read it to us?
It's written on toilet tissue.
"My dear Dr. Lecktor,
"I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me.
"I know that you alone can understand what I am becoming.
"You alone know the people I use to help me in these things
"are only elements undergoing change
"to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming,
"just as the source of light is burning.
"I have a collection of your press clippings.
"I think they are absurd, as are mine.
"'The Tooth Fairy,' what could be more inappropriate?
"Investigator Graham interests me,
"very purposeful-looking.
"I hope we can correspond. "
There's a piece missing here.
Now I'll read the bottom part.
"After I hear back from you,
"I might send you something wet. "
Signed "Avid Fan. "
It has teeth marks pressed into it at the bottom.
Order a chopper, next thing smoking.
I don't care whose it is.
Two, call Alabama Air National Guard, get Graham back here right now.
Then call Documents and tell them to scramble a team.
I want everybody moving five minutes ago.
You understand?
I have a Documents team on its way to you by helicopter to pick up the note.
Listen, after we've worked the note,
I want to replace it in Lecktor's cell.
I don't want Lecktor to know that we've found it, he might try to warn the killer somehow.
Where's Lecktor now?
Holding cell.
How long can you keep him in there without him getting suspicious?
Three, four hours.
Brian, we have a note coming in on the flight, possibly from the Tooth Fairy, number one priority.
It has to go to Hair and Fiber,
Latent Prints, and then Documents.
Will Graham and I will be walking it through.
One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.
And a couple of blue grains.
Work the hair.
What do we have for negative comparison?
Hair from Lecktor's comb, whiskers from Lecktor's razor they let him use.
This is hair from the security guard.
How many guys handled this without gloves?
The guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
The cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had the oil washed off his fingers.
But the others...
One smudge.
Those aren't ridges.
It's just the texture of the paper.
I can fume for a print, but can't guarantee the iodine stains would fade out.
Ninhydrin?
Boost it with heat?
No.
We couldn't wash it after.
I can't get a print off this in the time you've got to get it back, Will.
How long do I have?
Twenty minutes, max.
The main thing to find out is, how was Lecktor supposed to reply to him?
Which is probably the missing section, because at the top it says,
"I hope we can correspond," then comes the gap.
This note was written in ballpoint, but it looks like Lecktor went over this area with a felt-tip pen, then tore it away.
You're so sly, but so am I.
The aniline dyes used in the ink of the felt-tip pens like Lecktor used are transparent to infrared.
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.
This looks like the tip of a T here, here, and here.
At the end is what could be the top of an R.
There's three Ts and an R in "Tattler. "
We know our boy reads it.
The article about me and Lecktor.
I don't know anybody else that's carried that.
Personal ads.
We believe the Tooth Fairy told Lecktor to reply to him through the personal ad section of the National Tattler.
The Chicago office is down there right now running through their ads.
We have cut into a line of communication between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor.
If we find Lecktor's reply we plan to pull it, substitute it with one of our own.
And this is what the Tooth Fairy will read.
Bill?
"Dear Avid Fan, inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements.
"Mementoes for you at Baltimore Central Left Luggage.
"Ticket number 72683."
It's a Secret Service letter drop.
We plan to stake it out.
When he shows, we'll grab him.
Anything from Chicago?
Not yet.
When do they go to press?
Thirty-five minutes.
Christ.
Let's get to the physical.
There was no print.
Scale counts and core size of the hair match the blond hair found in the Jacobis'.
That note was written by your man.
Aside from the hair, three blue grains, dark flecks, went to Brian's end.
The grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine, from the cleaning man.
Several particles of dried blood, but not enough to type.
This is Chester.
Who am I talking to?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford.
Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in it being telexed to you right now.
Read it.
"Dear Avid Fan,
"You honor me.
You're very beautiful. "
Oh, Christ.
"I offer 100 prayers for your safety.
"Find help in Galatians 11, 15:2,
"Acts 3:3, Revelations 18:7,
"Jonah 6:8, John 6:22,
"Luke 1:7."
Thanks.
Jimmy.
Did you get anywhere at all identifying him off the Leeds' prints?
Not yet.
Photography at Langley?
They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.
No.
And our ad has to go out in the same book code Lecktor used, or he'll know it wasn't Lecktor talking to him.
Book code?
"100 prayers" could be the page number, the paired numbers could be line and letter.
But what book?
Not the Bible?
No.
Galatians 15:2.
Galatians only has six chapters.
The same with Jonah 6:8.
Jonah only has four chapters.
Lecktor was not using the Bible.
Then the Tooth Fairy probably named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
Right.
What about sweating Lecktor?
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.
He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
Wonderful.
The Tooth Fairy would have named a book he knew Lecktor has access to.
He'd know it from articles he'd read about Lecktor.
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they can get everything back in place.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books.
Where?
Library of Congress.
Twenty-five minutes.
He won't make it in time.
Lecktor's ad runs as is, we decode it later.
Or we pull it, figure out the code and run our own ad next week.
And lose a week?
We got 17 days till the next full moon.
And I don't like Lecktor's ad running without knowing what it says.
It's your call, Will.
Run it.
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something else beside write?
We'll all feel sick for a very long time.
And if Bowman still can't figure it out?
Then we'll bait him with something else in next week's Tattler.
What, for instance?
Me.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
Why not?
Don't you think we can provoke him?
Maybe.
Maybe he can be provoked.
What I was thinking about is you.
You're getting deeper and deeper into this.
Good night.
Sidney.
I'll talk to you.
Last time you did that you did a real good job of pushing yourself all out of shape.
You try it on again or you go through some big trauma, you could relapse, my friend.
Sidney, don't worry about me.
I'm working the evidence, making moves.
That's all.
I'm fine.
Bowman just struck out.
It is not books in Lecktor's cell.
Price?
He just heard.
It's a bust-out.
As evidence, the Leeds print will get us a conviction if we could ever find the guy.
But he must never have been printed because he is not in our index.
We are not gonna identify him off the print.
I'll use Lounds.
What for?
Our boy doesn't read the New York Times literary supplement.
He reads Lounds in the Tattler.
What else should we cover?
He put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.
I believe he did this to make sure we wouldn't think he was gay.
He's molested all of his male victims.
He may be impotent with members of the opposite sex.
Our forensic psychologists have projected, though I'm not sure, that he may have had sexual relations with his mother.
So, how long do you plan to stay in Washington?
Till we've taken out the Tooth Fairy.
Can the Tattler rely on getting the straight stuff from you?
Absolutely.
How does working on this case affect your sex life?
Mine?
It doesn't affect mine, it affects yours.
Go fuck yourself.
Look, pal of mine, you're news.
Shoot the pictures.
All right, Symie, let's shoot them.
I'm in the shots with Graham.
What?
I'm in the shots with you.
Come on, you want this to look real or not?
Make sure the theater sign across the street is just slightly out of focus.
We want him to be able to read it so he can find it, but we don't want to look too obvious.
You make sure that I look excellent.
All right, shoot it.
One more.
One more.
That's enough.
Okay, Graham.
Hey, always nice, huh?
Let's have lunch, call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.
Dr. Bloom.
I need them on my desk in two hours.
Did Bowman break the code yet?
No.
Tools and Firearms say the cutting tool used on the severed branch was a common bolt cutter.
I got a call from Asian Studies at Langley.
The mark you found on the tree?
Yeah?
It's a Chinese character considered a lucky sign in gambling.
That same character appears on a Mah Jongg piece.
It means "Red Dragon. " Mean anything to you?
No.
If he shows, and he's smart, he'll approach you from the front, pass, turn, try and take you from behind.
How's your hearing?
It's good.
You'll wear a wire, one-way.
We'll hear you, you won't hear us.
You checked out a Charter Arms .44
Special Bulldog?
Yeah.
Load these in it.
You ever fire them?
Glaser Safety Slugs.
Yeah.
Number 12 shots.
Suspended in liquid Teflon in a copper casing.
On impact it all opens up in the target.
Guaranteed one-shot stop.
You got body armor?
Yeah, Kevlar Second Chance.
I hope you get one.
'Cause he's gone for the head shot eight of eleven times?
Let's walk the route.
United Flight 849 to Newark now boarding at Gate 7...
United Flight 849 to Newark now boarding at Gate 7.
Someone's coming.
Go!
Don't!
Don't move!
Take the money!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Clear!
What you moving in slow motion for, man?
I'm being mugged!
For real.
Can you believe that?
Pay up.
...in sports, the Cubs lost again.
Hey!
You know who I am?
I don't want to know who you are.
According to you, I'm a sexual pervert.
"An animal," you said.
You know who I am now?
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Open your eyes.
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.
Your job is to report.
That's why you're here.
And if you don't open your eyes,
I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Well, here I am.
Look at the screen.
William Blake's The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed In The Rays Of The Sun.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Leeds.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi.
Do you see?
Yes.
The next family as they will look when I go to visit them.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Leeds, later.
Her husband beside her.
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.
The Dragon rampant.
Freddie Lounds, your photograph.
No.
No what?
Not me, please.
Please.
Are you a man?
Yes.
Do you imply that I'm queer?
God, no.
Before me, you are a slug in the sun.
You are privy to a great becoming, and you recognize nothing.
You are an ant in the afterbirth.
It is your nature to do one thing correctly, tremble.
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, Lounds, you and the others, you owe me awe.
We have one more piece of work to do.
If he takes off the mask, I am a dead man.
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!
You will read this into the tape recorder.
Go.
"I have had a great privilege.
"I have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the Red Dragon.
"All I wrote about him were lies.
"Will Graham made me write them
"to pull him into a trap in Washington, District of Columbia.
"Will Graham, you will learn from my own lips
"how much you have to dread because I was forced to lie.
"He will be more merciful to me than to you.
"You will lie awake in fear of what the Red Dragon will do.
"I will be a testament to the truth of this. "
You did very well.
Will you let me go now?
Please?
You will tell the truth?
I promise.
Good.
We'll seal your promise with...
We'll seal your promise
with a kiss.
We'll be showing five possible answers to the questions I'll be asking.
Any member of a team may buzz in an answer, but if incorrect, then the other team will have the opportunity...
Bowman, just skip the cryptography and tell me what the hell it says, okay?
Did he try to say anything at all?
No, he sure didn't.
He never regained consciousness.
Did you hear the tape?
Yeah.
Listen, Bowman just broke the code that Lecktor used in the Tattler personal ad.
It was the State of Maryland statutes.
You need to know what it said right now.
What?
Listen to me.
Everything is okay.
I've taken care of it.
What is it, Jack?
The bastard gave him your home address.
It said, "Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway,
"Captiva, Florida.
"Save yourself.
Kill them all. "
Get me a plane.
Will!
Mom.
Huh?
What time...
What?
Someone's outside.
There are noises.
Where?
Outside.
Mom...
Go back to your room and close the door.
Mom...
Do it now.
Ma'am, are you all right?
What?
What is it?
What is it?
What's going on?
Ma'am, I think you should come back inside.
What's going on?
Come back inside.
Please.
I think you should come back inside.
I'm sorry, Molly.
I'm sorry about all of this.
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.
He's after you now, isn't he?
This is just a precaution.
Kevin, why don't you run down to the water, check out the dock?
I want to hang around here.
I'm in the kitchen, Mom.
Okay.
What is that about?
What, he's afraid to leave you alone with me now?
He saw the article in the Tattler, right?
I wanted to talk with him about it, but he said he wanted to bring it up to you, face to face.
Good for him.
Kevin, help me unpack, will you?
Then we'll go get some groceries.
You and Mom are very well-protected, you know.
No one's gonna find out where you are.
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
No.
This guy is trying to kill us?
We don't know that.
When are you going to kill him?
I'm not.
It's only my job to find him.
Barry's mom had this newspaper.
It said you were in a special hospital.
Well, it was a regular hospital, then I was transferred into the psychiatric wing.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
I don't know.
Was it because in the papers it said it was this man Lecktor?
Mmm-hmm.
What happened?
Well, Lecktor was attacking college girls, then he killed them.
How?
In bad ways.
He was a psychiatrist.
One of the girls was his patient, and I went to talk to him about her.
I tried to build feelings in my imagination like the killer had so that I would know why he did what he did, because that would help me find him.
When I was sitting in Lecktor's office and I looked up, I saw a book on his shelf.
It had pictures of war wounds in it.
And I knew it was him.
So I went to a pay phone down the hall to call the police and that's when he attacked me.
You and Mom came to see me in the hospital, and that helped a lot.
But after my body got okay,
I still had his thoughts going around in my head.
And I stopped talking to people.
And a doctor friend of mine, a Dr. Bloom, asked me to get some help.
And I did.
Then after a while I felt better, and I was okay again.
And the way he thought felt that bad?
Kevin, they're the ugliest thoughts in the world.
So, what kind of coffee do you like?
You like that Folgers stuff, right?
Yeah.
Mom likes that, too.
When can we go home, Dad?
I don't know, Kevin.
So, where are things?
Nowhere.
Everything we've tried is either a dead end or it's backfired.
Crawford's already planning the next crime scene so they can get it fresh.
We've got about six more days till the next full moon.
Can you quit?
No.
What's next?
I go to Atlanta.
Crawford?
No.
I have to be alone.
You're talking about doing exactly what you said you...
This killing, it's gotta stop.
William, you're gonna make yourself sick.
Or get yourself killed.
You and Kevin should go to Montana.
See your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.
And I'll come up and get you afterwards.
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry I can't come to the phone right now.
I'm sorry, too.
Excuse me.
Coffee.
It's just you and me now, sport.
I'm gonna find you, God damn it.
Mr. Dollarhyde?
Eileen.
Bill told me to tell you there was a variation in the gamma of number three.
But he caught it in time.
Eileen, good.
Good.
Who's there?
Mr. Dollarhyde.
I came about the low-light infrared emulsion.
Oh, yeah.
Come on in, it's safe.
Put your back against the door.
There's a stool just to your right.
You're the production controller from Admin, right?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions?
Shooting from maybe eight feet.
I can't use any lights.
Okay, what's being photographed?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
Four days.
Okay, let me stick this in the black hole.
1000-C infrared sensitive has to be handled in total darkness.
Remember to be very careful with it.
But still, it's easier to handle than the 1200 series.
It'll be fine.
In case you're wondering,
I keep the samples straight by touch code.
No, I wasn't wondering.
Reba, I gotta fly.
Maybe Mr. Dollarhyde can drive you home tonight.
No, that's okay.
I'll take care of myself.
I can change things around.
No, thanks, go on.
Okay.
I'll take you.
No, thanks.
I'll order you 1200 feet of 1000-C in the morning.
Ride with me.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus.
I do it all the time.
Ride with me.
It would be because I would like you to.
Okay, sure.
Let me get my stuff on.
How did you come to Gateway?
Oh, they had to hire the handicapped to shape up their employment practices to get this defense contract.
You worked out well.
Everybody they hired did.
You know, you speak very well.
Although you avoid fricatives and sibilants.
At the Riker Institute for the Blind,
I trained in therapy for speech- and hearing-impaired children.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Mmm-hmm.
You know, if you don't want to talk, that's okay.
But I hope you will, because you're very direct, and I like that, and I like what you have to say.
May I touch your face?
I want to know whether you're smiling or frowning.
I guess I want to know whether I should be quiet or not.
Take my word for it.
I'm smiling.
I didn't mean to offend you.
On the way, can I take you somewhere?
Where?
It would be my surprise.
Okay, sure.
Are you apprehensive?
No.
The very protective Mr. Dollarhyde over there is watching us.
No, no, I want to.
In about two hours we're going to cap his tooth.
Yeah.
It's warm.
Back a little bit.
There.
You hear it?
Yeah.
You rearrange the dead families into an audience to see what you do.
You think that what you do will make you into something different.
You are becoming.
What is it you think you're becoming?
The answer is in the way you use the mirrors.
What do the mirrors make you dream you're becoming?
A little to your left.
Francis, that was a great dinner.
Thank you.
I made you a gin and tonic.
It's right in front of you.
What are you watching?
It's just a little homework.
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, D.
Is there a fire in the sky?
Your heart's loud.
Is there a moon up there?
If you'll hold me...
Is anything alive now?
This darkness is what I hear
This is a breathless silence
A moment out of time
I see your face in the shadows
The tell-tale signs are in your eyes
Aching with a passion inside
Deep as the river
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
Is there a flame in the dark?
Is there a bright heart star?
These creatures look the same now
We freeze wherever we are
We wake alone in the blackness
We sleep wherever we fall
One dream all around us
This big hush infects us all
Forever in this half-light
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
Is that you, D?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Hi.
Good morning.
Morning.
You know, if you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee.
No, no...
Don't go back inside the house.
Why?
I left my purse inside.
I'll get it.
It's okay.
I mean, you should stay outside, it's...
It's...
It's 'cause you look so good in the sun.
Okay.
When...
Reba, when can I see you again?
Oh!
Um...
We could meet at my house.
You got the message Lecktor called?
Yeah.
I arranged for him to have a phone.
I gotta call him in a few minutes.
Good.
Listen, we identified the tire tracks left when Lounds was delivered back to the Tattler.
G-7816 Goodyear truck tires.
Looks like our boy drives a van.
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you coming back?
When I'm done, Jack.
Yeah, this is Will Graham of the FBI.
Dr. Chilton arranged for me to talk to Dr. Lecktor.
Hello?
Hello, Will.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds.
I admire that enormously.
Oh, what a cunning boy you are.
I'm sick of you crazy sons of bitches.
You got something to say, say it.
I want to help you.
You'd be more comfortable if you relax with yourself.
We don't invent our natures, they're issued to us, along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else.
Why fight it?
Fight what?
Did you really feel so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death?
I didn't know you then, but I think you probably did.
But it wasn't the act that got you down, was it?
Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?
And why shouldn't it feel good?
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.
God's terrific.
He dropped a church roof on 34 of his worshippers last Wednesday night in Texas as they were groveling through a hymn to his majesty.
Don't you think that felt good?
Why does it feel good, Dr. Lecktor?
It feels good, Will, because God has power.
And if one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.
He got 140 Filipinos in one plane crash last month.
Remember that earthquake in Italy last spring?
I enter.
The glass cutter.
The piece of glass I take out is mine.
The house is mine.
I walk up these stairs,
I pass the children's toys.
The children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.
I move to the door.
I step into the room.
I see you there.
And I see me desired by you.
Accepted and loved in the silver mirrors of your eyes.
Father, look in my eyes
See me as I really am
You made me
Now take me
I'm gonna talk to Fogel tomorrow...
Tell me how it feels now
Behold your flesh has come of age
Wait a minute.
Forsake me, you break me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that scares me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that dares me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that haunts me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that taunts me
Mother, let me heal you
Your pain has lasted far too long
Release it, it kills you
What was it?
Pollen.
Oh.
Thanks for the ride.
See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
The love you would not share grows tired of waiting
Mr. Dollarhyde.
What are you doing here?
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that scares me
Strong as I am
Who is it?
It's me.
Who?
Who is it?
It's me.
Oh.
Francis?
No, not Francis.
Francis is gone.
Francis is gone forever.
So, what are we doing?
The dream.
He dreams about being wanted and desired, so he changes people into beings who want and desire him.
Changes?
It's a word.
Killing and arranging the people to imitate it.
And Lecktor told me something.
If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
You put it together, you get, if our boy imitates being wanted and desired enough times, he believes he will become one who is wanted and desired and accepted.
It'll all come true.
This started from an abused kid, a battered infant.
There's something terrible about...
What, are you sympathizing with this guy now?
Absolutely.
My heart bleeds for him as a child.
Someone took a kid and manufactured a monster.
At the same time, as an adult, he's irredeemable.
He butchers whole families to pursue trivial fantasies.
As an adult, someone should blow this sick fuck out of his socks.
Do you think that's a contradiction, Jack?
Does this kind of understanding make you uncomfortable?
What about the mirrors?
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.
But he doesn't take anything.
There's no souvenirs taken from the houses.
He needs souvenirs or trophies to re-live the event.
Maybe he records it somehow.
So he could see himself accepted over and over and over again.
VTRs, Polaroids, stills, what?
How do I know?
How does he find them?
When we find out how he found them, we'll find him.
There is no connection between the two families.
We've done a dozen computer runs.
Jack, all the women have a bloom on them.
He didn't win them in a lottery, he picked these women.
There's selection and design in his choices.
Look, admit we struck out this month.
The Lear Jet is standing by, the basic lab stuff is on it.
You, Zeller, Jimmy Price, the photographer, anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and 15 minutes.
We get the call, we roll.
The scene will be fresher than we've ever had it.
It's not over yet.
For Christ's sake!
That's a foregone conclusion.
It's 11:30 p. m., the full moon is happening tonight.
Give it up!
Forget this month, it's too damn late!
I gave it up.
Till you showed up with pictures of two dead families, knowing goddamn well that I'd imagine families three, four, five and six.
Right?
You're fucking right I did, and I'd do it again!
Great!
But don't talk to me about late, pal,
I'll tell you when it's too fucking late!
Until then, we go as late as I want to take it!
A padlock.
That's why the bolt cutter.
What's that?
He used a bolt cutter to trim away the branch when he was watching from the woods.
Why didn't he use the bolt cutter on the garage door?
Because a deadbolt was there when they were killed.
Donald Jacobi's 12th birthday party was April 14th.
Sometime between April 14th and August 1 they changed the lock.
But he thought there was a padlock there.
From the street, you can't see the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door.
There's a big, high fence there.
But he was ready with his glass cutter.
So either he was casing far ahead and we didn't check back far enough,
or...
We checked.
Don't talk.
Metcalfe, is the Leeds and Jacobi stuff still in the storeroom?
Have the guard down there call me.
Do it.
You know that's the Jacobis' cat.
You brought a bolt cutter 'cause you thought there was a padlock.
The Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog, don't you, my man?
See the woman?
The bloom on the woman?
You can see her again and again anytime you want.
Doggie doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog.
And the Jacobi cat.
And the padlock on the door.
And you know you need a bolt cutter and every other goddamn thing because everything with you is seeing, isn't it?
Your primary sensory intake that makes your dream live is seeing.
Reflections, mirrors, images...
You've seen these films.
Haven't you, my man?
It's the guard in the storeroom.
The cans.
What cans?
The tapes were transferred from home movies.
Where's the packaging the films came in?
There's films of the families in the document storage.
Find them.
You got them?
Are there any labels?
Leeds can, Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
The Jacobi label will say the same thing as the Leeds label.
Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
Who processed the Jacobi film?
No.
Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.
Stores send them out.
Have him peel the top label back.
Is there a label underneath?
It does, doesn't it?
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes to Meigs Field.
At Meigs Field,
I want the Lear Jet prepped and a plan filed with St. Louis.
Where are you?
Are you here?
You're scaring me with this!
Will you just stop it?
Francis, why are you doing this to me?
It's ugly!
Don't you know that I'll always be true?
Are you in this room?
Where are you?
You answer me!
And take my hand
Oh, won't you come with me
And walk this land
Please, take my hand
We're looking for a man.
We know he works at Gateway.
We don't have his name, but we know he drives a van.
Under "Employee Facilities,"
I've got special stickers for vans.
Yeah, I got 28, 29 van permits in the computer.
Start feeding me names.
Is this Lieutenant Fisk?
Will Graham.
Listen, I need you to punch up the driver's licenses of the names I'm gonna feed you.
The man we're looking for is blond, Caucasian, twenty to forty years old, over six feet tall, 180 to 225 pounds.

We're on approach to Lambert Field.
Fogel has four more names.
He knows two, both dark hair, third's a woman, fourth is a handicapped parking permit.
This is our man.
Rural Route 3, Chester, Missouri.
Where is that?
From the airport you're a few minutes closer.
We'll 10-25 at the Hark Road off ramp, Highway 94.
Let's go!
Meet point's up ahead.
Go on to the house.
But Lieutenant Fisk said...
Go on to the house.
Will?
You're not gonna need that.
A SWAT team is gonna take him down, not us.
Will?
Will!
This ought to be it right here.
Kill your lights.
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
Griffin's hurt bad.
I'll wait for the backup.
Set up a roadblock on Route 3.
Graham and I are in the trees west of the house.
How far away is the backup unit?
I'm going around the back.
Stay in the trees.
He's in there, Jack.
And he's got somebody in there with him.
What?
Will, what did you say?
Will.
Wait for the backup, Will.
He's got somebody in the house with him, Jack.
Will.
Stop it.
Stop it!
Three, four
In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey
Don't you know that I love you?
In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby
Don't you know that I'll always be true?
Oh, won't you come with me
And take my hand
Oh, won't you come with me
And walk this land
Please, take my hand
It's okay.
Who are you?
Graham.
I'm Will Graham.
I can hear your heartbeat knocking on the window
Hey, Dad!
I can feel the weight deep down below
Dad!
Hey!
It looks worse than it is, pal.
See the turtles?
Wow!
Hi.
It was on the news.
I thought I had to work things out and call you after.
I thought I wouldn't wait.
Sometimes I understand it very clearly
Heartbeat, heartbeat Listen to my heartbeat
How many of them made it?
Most of them.
Most of them made it.
Heartbeat Listen to my heartbeat
I can hear your tiptoe
I can hear the door close
Anticipation in me grows
I can feel your dark eyes
Touch me in the darkness
Understand the message never sent

We should have talked to the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk here.
I'm not falling over to talk about it much anywhere, Jack.
How much do you know?
- Not much.
The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago, and Atlanta was all over TV.
Did you think about giving me a call?
- No.
- Why not?
I quit, remember?
You look alright now.
I am alright.
If you can't look anymore, I understand.
Don't play games with me!
If I really didn't need you, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks till full moon.
We have a better chance if you help me.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
Think it'll keep them out, Dad?
- Yep.
How many turtle's eggs are in here?
- ln this hatchery?
40 or 50 of 'em.
Crabs get most of them, huh?
- Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it.
What about the dogs?
No.
That's why we buried the wire down in the sand.
I need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be his friend.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, Molly, I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.
We've got it pretty good.
- More than good.
All that happened before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only look at the evidence.
I wouldn't get involved.
He'd never even see me.
If they find him, they'll have to take him down.
What do you think?
You've already decided and you're not really asking.
If I were asking?
Stay here with me.
Me and Kevin.
That's selfish and I know it.
I'll come inside with you and show you around.
Mr. Crawford said maybe you want to be alone.
- That's right.
There's a VCR in your hotel room.
There's home movies of both families on half inch VHS.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen door.
Used a glass cutter on a suction cup.
Entry was skilful.
All prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair, strong.
Size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood AB positive, from saliva on glass from the suction cup.
Why did he leave saliva on the glass?
It was hot that night, so it must have felt cool in the house.
Intruder cut Charles Leeds's throat then shot Mrs. Leeds.
Bullet lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation.
Moderate elevation of serotonin and an increase in histamine indicate she lived for 5 minutes after the shot.
All other injuries are post-mortem.
Direction of the blood stains on the wall indicate arterial spray.
Leeds tried to fight because intruder moved towards the children's room.
Blood stains on west wall in master bedroom and sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained,
as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leeds' chest.
Also believed post-mortem.
What did the killer do with them after they were dead?
Hi.
This is Valerie Leeds.
I can't speak right now, but if you leave a message after the beep, I'll get right back.
290th floor.
Going up.
When they were dead, he smashed the mirrors and selected pieces for use on Mrs. Leeds.
Killing Mr. Leeds and the children would take less than a minute.
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem 4 or 5 minutes later.
What did he do in the interval?
He smeared blood stains on the wall.
Hello?
- Molly?
Will, is that you?
- Yeah, honey.
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
I love you.
- l love you too, baby.
What are you dreaming?
That's something you can't afford for me to know about.
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
lr was maddening to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg, but there wasn't any in the bathroom.
It came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you?
You touched her with your bare hands and then you put your gloves back on!
But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so they could see you?
Hallo?
- Jack, this is Graham.
is Price still in Latent Prints?
- Yeah, the Single Print Index.
What have you got?
- Get him to Atlanta.
Atlanta P. D. dusted everything and they're good.
- Not as good as Price.
I'll send him tomorrow.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails and the corneas of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves.
The subject's teeth look like this.
These were reconstructed from the bite mark impressions we took from Mrs. Leeds and the Jacobi woman.
He has pegged lateral incisors, that's these teeth here and here.
Vice and narcotics, you take the K-Y cowboys and the leather bars.
Marcus, Whitman heads up at the funeral.
The rest, see the sheet.
One more thing.
I've heard officers call this killer the 'Tooth Fairy'.
Well, I don't wanna hear that in public or see it in memoranda!
That's it.
I know a burglar's gonna fence what he stole for cash money.
I know his motive, so I go to work on fences.
This guy, we don't have a motive.
None of us have shit and we know it.
It's in his dreams.
His motive?
- Yeah.
His act fuels his fantasy.
Which is?
- l don't know.
Commissioner says you're the one who got Garrett Jacob Hobbes and then Dr. Lecktor 3 years ago?
- Lecktor killed 90 people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
I heard he cut you pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's.
It has puncture wound.
The Jacobis had a cat.
That's right.
We found the litter box, but not the cat.
Give Birmingham P. D. a methane probe out of Washington.
Have them cover the backyard.
Maybe the cat's buried there.
Yeah?
- This is Jimmie Price, fbi.
Let me put you on the speaker.
- Who am I talking to?
Jack Crawford and Will Graham.
I got a partial print, probably a thumb.
And a fragment of a palm off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.
Thumb print came off the oldest kid's left eye.
Can we make an identification off it?
- Maybe if he's in my index.
Wanna work on these in the dark room.
I'll fax the prints this afternoon.
- Thanks.
If we get lucky with that print ... lf Jimmie can find him in the index.
- Hey, Graham!
Whatta you say?
It's me, Lounds, from the "Tattler".
I did the Lecktor paperback.
When did they call you in?
I'm buying lunch, alright?
- Give it a rest!
I'm doing my job.
How does he compare to Lecktor?
What does he do to them?
How does he do 'em, Will?
Keep the fuck away from me!
- Will, Will!
Son-of-a-bitch snuck into the hospital while I was sedated and took pictures.
I know.
- Don't expect too much from me.
We only got three weeks left.
- You think I'm just gonna see him?
That's Houdini!
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on till we get smart or lucky.
He won't stop.
Why?
He's got a taste for it.
- You do know something about him.
Not enough.
I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mind set.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court 3 years ago.
I keep getting it for Christmas.
Did you get my card?
- l got it, thank you.
How is Officer Stuart?
Fine.
- Emotional problems, I hear.
Do you have any problems, Will?
- No.
No, of course you don't.
I'm glad you came.
My callers are usually psychologists from cornfield universities.
Second-raters, the lot.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction.
- And?
Very interesting, even to a layman.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
- l thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
- Yes?
- You read about it?
In the papers.
I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing them.
Any ideas?
- Why should I tell you?
You get to see the file.
There's another reason.
- Pray tell.
You might be curious to see if you're smarter.
Smarter than you, since you caught me?
I know I'm not smart.
- Then how did you catch me?
Your disadvantages.
- What disadvantages?
You're insane.
You're very tanned, Will.
Your hands are rough.
Not cop's hands any more.
And that shaving lotion is from a child?
With a ship on the bottle?
Don't think appeals to my intellectual vanity will work.
I don't think that.
You'll do it or you won't.
Dr. Bloom's working on it.
He's the best.
Have you got the file?
- Yes.
- Pictures?
- Yes.
Let me have them and I'll consider it.
- No.
Dream much, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file and I'll tell you what I think.
This is a very shy boy.
What were the yards like?
- Big, fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, if he imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he'll go look outside.
Ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy.
Interesting.
No.
You thought of it before.
- l considered it.
You wanted to look at me.
To get the scent back.
- l want your opinion.
I don't have one now.
- When you do, I want to hear it.
Can I keep this?
- Haven't decided.- l'll study them.
Also any other files.
You can call me.
For calls to my lawyer I get a phone.
Will you leave me your home number?
No.
Do you know how you caught me?
There's a number on the file.
- Do you know how you caught me?
You caught me, Will, because we're just alike.
You want the scent, smell yourself!
Gotcha!
Get up and face the wall.
Don't turn around, or I'll mace you in the face.
Thank you so much.
I'll call when I'm finished.
You ready for your call?
- Yes, thank you.
Paltrow, Christiansen and Golub, Law Offices.
I'm sorry, I misdialed.
Thank you for using ATT.
This is Operator 24.
Operator, I don't have the use of my arms.
Would you dial a number for me?
- Certainly.
What's the number?
Area code 3-0-1.
5-5-5-6-6-2-4.
University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry.
- Dr. Bloom, please.
I'll connect you with his office.
What's his secretary's name?
- Martha King.
Just a moment.
Martha King's desk.
- Hi, Martha.
Martha doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob Greer.
Dr. Bloom asked me to send a paper to someone, but I never got the address or number.
- She'll be in in the morning.
I've got to catch the Federal express.
Could you pull it out of her Rolodex?
I don't see a Rolodex.
- l bet she has a call caddy.
Yeah.
- Well point right on down to G.
Alright.
- The last name is Graham.
The man the book is for.
Mr. Will Graham.
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation, 10th and Pennsylvania, Washington D. C.
I bet his home address is there too.
3680 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida.
Thank you very much.
Finished!
Mommy!
- Oh my gosh!
Lt's OK.
Stewardess?
There's a couple down from Duluth, we were talking about mortgages.
And ... I figure, you're gonna unload this turkey.
Well, then the squad car rolls up, they start asking questions, the whole Grand Tour:
Who was lying where and what.
Terrific.
So they get in their sedan and get the hell out of here.
Any single men ask to see the house?
No-one asked me.
You cut the branch so you could see.
Then you passed the time whittling and dreaming.
When night came, you saw them behind bright windows.
You watched the shades go down, saw the lights go out one by one.
Then you went in to 'em, didn'tcha?
Didn't you, son-of-a-bitch?
You watched them all day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
I need the Firearms and Toolmarks Section on the severed branch.
I need Bowman to fall on this carving.
- ls it weird?
The mark?
Yeah.
If Documents can't do it, Langley can.
- Did Price get an identification?
No, not yet.
It's a hand search.
Have you seen the "Tattler"?
It's not on my reading list.
- Yeah, well, you're all over the front page.
Who the hell was it, Lounds?
- Who else?
Goddammit, Jack!
I promised Molly.
Come in!
- Dr. Chilton?
- Yes?
On cleaning out Dr. Lecktor's cell, he hid something in a book.
We dug around.
- ls that it?
Put it down.
Has anyone seen this except you?
- No.
Crawford's office.
- This is Chilton.
Mr. Graham please!
He's not here.
Mr. Crawford is on the line with him now.
Will you tell him this is very, very urgent.
L'll hold on.
Dr. Chilton, it's Crawford.
Graham is on the line, too.
I have two pieces of a note that appears to be from the murderer in Atlanta.
Where did you get it?
- Hidden in a book in Lecktor's cell.
Don't touch the note.
Read it to us!
- lt's on toilet tissue.
"Dear Dr. Lecktor, I am delighted that you've taken an interest in me.
You alone can understand what I am becoming.
You know the people I used to help me are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.
Just as the source of light is burning.
My collection of your press clippings is as absurd as are mine.
The "Tooth Fairy".
What could be more inappropriate?
Investigator Graham interests me.
Very purposeful-looking.
I hope we can correspond."
There's a piece missing.
I'll read the bottom part.
"After I hear from you, I might send you something wet."
Signed: "Avid fan." There are teeth marks at the bottom.
Order a chopper.
Don't care whose.
2.
Call Alabama Air National Guard, get Graham back here right now.
Call Documents and scramble a team.
I want everybody moving'.
The Documents team is underway to pick up the note.
Listen, I wanna replace the note.
I don't want Lecktor to know.
He might try to warn the killer.
Where's Lecktor?
- Holding cell.
How long can you keep him in there?
- Three, four hours.
We have a note coming in, possibly from the Tooth Fairy.
No. 1 Priority.
Has to go to Hair and Fiber.
One hair.
Maybe half an inch.
Couple of blue grains.
- Work the hair.
What do you have as a negative comparison?
- Lecktor's comb.
Whiskers from a razor, hair from the Security Guard.
How many handled this without gloves?
Guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
- The cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had the oil washed off his fingers.
But the others ...one smudge.
No ridges, it's just the texture of the paper.
I can fume it but I can't say the iodine stains will fade.
- Ninhydrin?
Boosted with heat?
- No.
You couldn't wash it out.
I can't get a print in the time.
How long?
- 20 minutes max.
Main thing is, how was Lecktor supposed to reply?
It's probably in the missing section.
'l hope we can correspond'.
Then comes the gap.
This note was written in ballpoint.
But it looks like Lecktor went over this area with a felt-tip pen and tore it away.
You're so sly, but so am I.
The aniline dyes in the felt-tip pens, like Lecktor used, are transparent to infrared.
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.
This looks like the tip of a T.
This one could be the top of an R.
- Three T's and an R in "Tattler".
The article about me and Lecktor.
No-one else carried that.
Personal ads.
The Tooth Fairy told Lecktor to reply through the Personal ads in the "Tattler".
Chicago is running through them right now.
Here is a line of communication between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor.
If we find Lecktor's answer, we'll replace it with our own.
This is what he'll read:
"Dear Avid Fan:
lnherit my mantle and surpass my achievements.
Mementos for you at Baltimore Central.
Left luggage.
Ticket 7-2-6-8-3."
It's a letter drop.
We stake it out and grab him.
Anything from Chicago?
- Not yet.
- When do they go to press?
In 35 minutes.
- Christ!
- Let's get to the physical.
There was no print.
- The core size of the hair matches the blond hair found in the Jacobi's.
Your man wrote the note.
Three blue grains went to Brians's end.
Commercial granulated cleanser from the cleaning man.
Particles of dried blood, but not enough to type.
This is Chester, who's there?
- Will Graham, Jack Crawford.
Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in it.
- Read it!
"Dear Avid Fan, you honor me.
You're very beautiful.
One hundred prayers for your safety.
Find help in Galatians 6, 11 and 15,2.
Acts 3,3;
Revelations 18,7.
Jonah 6,8;
John 6,22;
Luke 1,7.
Thanks.
Jimmie,
Get anywhere with the Leeds print?
- Not yet.
Cryptography at Langley?
- They're working on the telex now.
No.
Our ad has to go out in the same book code, or he'll know.
Book code?
"100 prayers" could be a page number and the paired numbers lines.
Galatians only has six chapters.
Same with Jonah, it only has four.
Lecktor was not using the Bible.
The Tooth Fairy probably named the book in the part torn out.
What about sweating' Lecktor?
We tried sodium amytal 3 years ago, and he gave 'em a recipe for a chip dip.
- Wonderful.
The Tooth Fairy knows which book.
He'd know from articles about Lecktor.
Willingham took Polaroids of Lecktor's cell.
Have him meet me.
- Where?
- Library of Congress.
25 minutes.
He won't make it.
Lecktor's ad runs as is, or we pull it and run our own ad next week.
- We got 17 days left till full moon!
I don't like Lecktor's ad running without knowing what it says.
It's your call, Will.
Run it.
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something else?
Then we'll all feel sick.
And if Bowman can't figure it out?
Then we'll bait him with something else in the "Tattler".
- What?
Me.
That's not a very good idea.
Why not?
Won't it provoke him?
- Maybe.
I was thinking about you.
You're getting in deeper and deeper.
Sidney?
The last time you pushed yourself all outta shape.
Try it on again, or if you go through some trauma, you could relapse.
Sidney, don't worry about me.
I'm workin' the evidence, makin' moves, that's all.
I'm fine.
Bowman says it is not books in Lecktor's cell.
Price?
- lt's a bust out.
The Leeds' print will get us a conviction.
He must never have been printed, because he is not in our index.
We are not gonna identify him off the print.
I'll use Lounds.
What for?
Our boy doesn't read the Times.
He reads Lounds in the "Tattler".
What else should we cover?
- He put the shorts on Leeds after he was dead, so we wouldn't think he was gay.
He molested all his male victims and may be impotent with women.
Our forensic psychologists have projected that he may have had sexual relations with his mother.
How long will you stay in Washington?
- Till we've got the Tooth Fairy.
Will the "Tattler" get the stuff?
How's your sex life been affected?
Mine?
Lt doesn't.
It affects yours!
Fuck yourself!
Look, pal, you're news!
- You shot the pictures.
Alright.
L'm in the shots with Graham.
- What?
- Yeah.
Come on!
You want this to look real?
Make sure the theater sign is just out of focus.
We want him to read it.
- And make sure I look excellent!
Shoot it!
One more.
One more.
- That's enough.
OK, Graham.
Always nice, huh?
Let's have lunch, call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.
Dr. Bloom.
L need them on my desk in 2 hours.
- OK.
Did Bowman break the code yet?
- No.
They say the cutting tool was a common bolt cutter.
I got a call from Asian Studies in Langley.
The mark on the tree is a Chinese lucky sign in gambling.
The same character appears in Mah-jongg.
Lt means Red Dragon.
Mean anything to you?
No.
If he shows and he's smart, he'll approach from the front, pass, turn and try and take you from behind.
How's your hearing?
- Good.
You'll wear a wire, one way.
We'll hear you, but you won't hear us.
Checked out a 44 Special Bulldog?
Load these in it.
You ever fire 'em?
- Glaser safety slugs?
Opens up on impact.
Guaranteed one shot stop.
You got body armor?
- Kevlar Second Chance.
Hope you get one.
- 'Cause he goes for the head shot?
Let's walk the route.
United Flight 8490 to Newark now boarding at gate 7.
United Flight 8490 to Newark now boarding at gate 7.
Can you get to a phone?
So where are things?
Got nine days left.
We're working on it.
You don't wanna talk about what you're doing, do you?
Hotel rooms ...
An illicit romance ...
We have to stop meeting like this.
Remember the first time we met?
Yeah.
We were alone together in that room.
Though I'd never seen you before, we were sitting there, speaking.
A shadow flickered across your face.
L said, "What's that?"
Remember what you said?
I said:
"This is too good to believe."
Time is luck, Will.
You know the value of every day.
Someone's coming.
Go!
Don't!
Don't move!
Take the money!
Don't shoot!
Clear!
Quicker, man!
I'm being mugged!
Do you know who I am?
- l don't wanna know who you are.
You said I'm a sexual pervert.
'An animal' you said.
Do you know who I am now?
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Open your eyes!
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.
That's why you're here.
Open your eyes or I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Well, here I ... am.
Look at the screen.
William Blake's
'The Great Red Dragon' and 'The Woman Clothed in the Rays of the Sun'.
Do you see?
- Yes.
Mrs. Leeds.
Do you see?
- Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi.
Do you see?
- Yes.
The next family as they will look.
Do you see?
- Yes.
Mrs. Leeds, later.
Her husband beside her.
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.
The Dragon rampant.
Freddie Lounds.
Your photograph.
No!
- No what?
- Not me, please!
Please!
- Are you a man?
- Yes.
Do you imply that I'm queer?
- God, no!
Before me you are a slug in the sun.
You are privy to a great becoming and you recognise nothing!
You are an ant in the afterbirth!
It is your nature to do one thing correctly... tremble.
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, Lounds, you and the others owe me awe!
One more piece of work to do.
If he takes off the mask, I'm dead now!
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!
Read this into the tape recorder.
Go.
"l have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the Red Dragon.
All I wrote about him were lies.
Will Graham made me write them to pull him into a trap.
Will Graham, you will learn how much you have to dread, because I lied.
He will be more merciful to me.
You will lie awake in fear of what the Red Dragon will do.
I will testify to the truth of this."
You did very well.
Will you let me go now?
Please?
You will tell the truth?
- l promise.
Good.
We'll seal your promise with ...
We'll seal your promise
with a kiss.
Only five answers are possible.
Any member of a team may buzz in and answer.
Bowman, skip the cryptography and tell me what it says!
Did he try to say anything at all?
- No.
He never regained consciousness.
Did you hear the tape?
- Yes.
Listen,
Bowman just broke Lecktor's code in the personal ad.
It's the State of Maryland Statutes.
You need to know, now.
- What?
Listen to me.
I've taken care of it.
What is it, Jack?
The bastard gave him your address.
It said: "Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida."
Save yourself.
Kill them all.
Get me a plane!
- Will!
Will!
Mom?
Huh?
What?
Someone's outside.
I hear noises.
- Where?
- Outside.
Go back to your room and close the door.
Mom?
- Do it, now!
Mom, are you alright?
- What?
What is it?
What is it?
What's going on?
Come back inside!
What's going on?
- Come inside!
- So what ...?
- Come back inside!
I'm sorry, Molly.
I'm sorry about all of this.
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.
He's after you now, isn't he?
- lt's just a precaution.
Kevin?
Run down to the water and check the out dock.
I wanna hang around here.
I'm in the kitchen, mom.
What's that about?
He's afraid to leave you alone with me now?
He saw the article in the "Tattler".
I wanted to talk to him, but he said he'd bring it up with you.
Good for him.
Kevin, help me unpack and then we'll get some groceries.
You and mom are well protected.
No one's gonna find you.
is there anything I need to know, to see about mom?
No.
This guy's planning to kill us?
- We don't know that.
When you gonna kill him?
I'm not.
It's only my job to find him.
In the newspaper it said you were in a special hospital.
Well, it was a regular hospital, then I was transferred to the psychiatric wing.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
I don't know.
Was it because of this man Lecktor?
What happened?
Lecktor attacked college girls and he killed them.
How?
In bad ways.
He was a psychiatrist.
One of the girls was his patient and I went to talk to him about her.
I tried to build up feelings like the killer had, so I would know why he did it 'cause that would help me find him.
I was sitting in Lecktor's office and saw a book on a shelf with pictures of war wounds.
And I knew it was him.
So I went to a pay phone to call the police.
That's when he attacked me.
You and mom ... came to see me in hospital and that helped a lot.
But after my body got OK, I still had his thoughts in my head.
I stopped talking to people.
A doctor friend, Dr. Bloom asked me to get help, and I did.
And after a while I felt better and I was OK again.
And the way you thought ...
felt that bad?
Kevin, the ugliest thoughts in the world.
What kind of coffee you like?
What?
You like that Folger's stuff, right?
- Yeah.
Mom too.
When can we go home, Dad?
- l don't know, Kevin.
So where are things?
Nowhere.
Everything we've tried is a dead end or has backfired.
Crawford is planning the next crime scene.
Six days till full moon.
- Can you quit?
No.
What's next?
I go to Atlanta.
- Crawford?
No.
I have to be alone.
You're talking about doing exactly what ...
- This killing it's gotta stop!
William, you're going to make yourself sick, or get killed.
You and Kevin should go to Montana, see your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.
I'll come and get you afterwards.
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
I'm sorry I can't come to the phone.
I'm sorry too.
- Excuse me?
- Coffee.
Just you and me now, sport.
I'm gonna find you, Goddammit!
Mr. Dollarhyde?
- Oh, Eileen.
- Bill says there's a variation in the gamma number 3, but he caught it in time.
Good.
Good.
Who's there?
- Mr. Dollarhyde.
I came about the infrared emulsion.
- Come in.
Lt's safe.
Put your back against the door.
Stool to the right.
You're the production controller?
What are the conditions?
- Shooting from 8 feet.
I can't use any lights.
- What's being photographed?
Nocturnal animals.
- When do you need it?
In four days.
- OK. I'll stick this in a black bag.
1000 C infrared-sensitive has to be handled in total darkness.
Remember to be careful.
It's easier than the 1200 series.
Fine. - ln case you're wondering, I keep the samples by touch.
I was wondering ... I gotta fly.
Perhaps Mr. Dollarhyde can drive you home.
No, that's OK.
No thanks.
Go on.
I'll take you.
- No thanks.
I'll order 1200ft of 1000 C tomorrow.
Ride with me!
- No thanks!
L'll take the bus.
Ride with me!
I would like you to.
OK, sure.
L'll just get my stuff on.
How did you come to Gateway?
They had to hire the handicapped to get this Defense contract.
- You worked out well.
Everybody they hired did.
You speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants.
I trained in therapy for speech and hearing-impaired children.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
If you don't wanna talk, that's OK.
You're very direct, I like that.
I like what you have to say.
May I touch your face?
Are you smiling or frowning?
I guess I wanna know whether I should be quiet or not.
Take my word for it, I'm smiling.
- l didn't mean to offend you.
Can I take you somewhere?
- Where?
It will be my surprise.
OK.
Sure.
Are you apprehensive?
- No.
The protective Mr. Dollarhyde is watching us. - l want to!
In about two hours we're going to cap his tooth.
It's warm.
There ...
Hear it?
You ... rearrange the dead families into an audience.
You think what you do makes you into something different.
You're becoming ...
What is it you're becoming?
The answer is in the way you use the mirrors.
What do the mirrors make you dream?
A little to your left.
Francis, that was a great dinner.
There's a gin and tonic, right in front of you.
What are you watching?
A little homework.
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, D.
Your heart's loud if you love me.
is that you, D.?
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Morning.
- Morning.
If you show me, I'll make us some coffee
- No!
Don't go back inside the house.
- l left my purse inside.
I'll get it, it's OK.
I mean, you should stay outside.
You look so good in the sun.
When ...
Reba, when can I see you again?
We could meet at my house.
You got the message Lecktor called?
Yeah.
L'll call him in a few minutes.
We identified the tire tracks when Lounds was delivered to the "Tattler".
G-7816, Goodyear truck tires.
Our boy drives a van.
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you back?
When I'm done, Jack.
Will Graham of the fbi.
I'd like to talk to Dr. Lecktor.
Hello?
Hello, Will.
Congratulations on the job you did on Mr. Lounds.
I admired it.
What a cunning boy you are.
I'm sick of you, Lecktor.
You've got something to say, say it!
I want to help you.
Relax with yourself!
We don't invent our natures, they're issued to us with our lungs and pancreas and everything else.
Why fight it?
Fight what?
Did you really feel depressed after you shot Hobbes to death?
I think you probably did.
But it wasn't the act that got to you.
Didn't you feel so bad, because killing him felt so good.
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.
God's terrific.
He dropped a church roof on 34 worshippers last Wednesday, while groveling through a hymn.
Don't you think that felt good?
Why does it feel good, Dr. Lecktor?
It feels good, because God has power.
If one does what God does, enough times, one will become as God is.
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.
He got 140 Phillipinos in one plane crash last year.
Remember that earthquake in Italy last spring?
I enter.
The glass cutter.
The piece of glass is mine.
The house is mine.
I walk up these stairs, I pass the children's toys.
The children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.
I move to the door.
I step into the room.
I see you there.
I see me desired by you.
Accepted and loved.
In the silver mirrors of your eyes.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
OK.
Wait a minute.
What was it?
- Pollen.
Oh.
- See you tomorrow.
Mr. Dollarhyde.
What are you doing here?
Who is it?
- lt's me.
Hallo?
Who is it?
- lt's me.
Francis?
- No.
Not Francis.
Francis is gone.
Francis is gone, forever.
So what do we do?
The dream.
He dreams about being desired.
So he changes people into beings who want and desire him.
Changes?
- lt's a word.
Killing and arranging the people to imitate it.
Lecktor told me something.
If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
You put it together, our boy imitates being wanted and desired enough times, he believes he'll become one who is wanted and desired.
It'll all come true.
What about the mirrors?
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.
But he doesn't take anything.
He needs souvenirs from the houses, so he can relive the event.
Maybe he records it somehow.
So he can see himself accepted over and over and over again.
VTR's, Polaroids, stills, what?
- How do I know?
How does he find them?
If we find out how he found them, we'll find him.
There is no connection between the two families.
All the women have a bloom on them.
He picked these women!
There's selection and design here.
- Look, admit we struck out this month.
The Lear Jet is standing by with the lab.
You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, the photographer.
We can be anywhere in 75 minutes!
We get the call, we roll!
This thing'll be fresh!
- lt's not over yet.
It's a foregone conclusion.
It's 11.30pm. The full moon is tonight.
Give it up!
It's too damn late!
- l gave it up.
Till you showed up with pictures of two dead families!
Fuckin' right!
I'd do it again!
- Great, but don't talk to me about late, pal!
I'll tell you when it's too late.
A padlock.
That's why the bolt cutter.
What's that?
Why didn't he use the bolt cutter on the garage door?
Because a deadbolt was there when they were killed.
Donald Jacobis birthday party was April 14th.
Sometime between April and August they changed the lock, but he thought there was a padlock.
From the street you can't see the glass on the Leeds' kitchen door.
There's a big, high fence there, but he was ready with his glass cutter.
Either he was casing far ahead, and we didn't check back far enough, or ...
We checked.
Metcalf, it's Graham.
Ls the Leeds and Jacobi stuff still there?
Have the guard down there call me.
Do it!
You know that's the Jacobi's cat.
He brought a bolt cutter, because he thought there was a padlock.
Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar, but you know it's their dog.
You see the woman?
The bloom on the woman?
You can see her again and again, anytime you want.
Doggie doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog ... and the Jacobi cat ... and the padlock on the door.
You know you need a bolt cutter.
Because everything with you is seeing.
Your primary sensory intake, making your dream live is seeing.
The reflections... mirrors ... images ...
You've seen these films!
Haven't you, my man?
The guard in the storeroom.
The cans!
- What cans?
- The tapes were transferred.
Where's the packaging of the films.
- There are films in storage.
You got 'em?
Are there any labels?
Leeds, Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
The Jacobi label says the same thing:
Gateway Lab, St. Louis.
Who processed the Jacobi film?
Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.
Stores send 'em out.
Have him peel the top label back.
is there a label underneath?
It does, doesn't it?
I want a chopper in three minutes to Meigs Field.
At Meigs Field I want the Lear Jet prepped for St. Louis.
Where are you?
Are you here?
You're scaring me!
Stop it!
Francis, why are you doing this to me?
It's ugly.
Are you in this room?
Where?
You answer me!
We're looking for a man.
We know he works at Gateway.
We don't have his name, but we know he drives a van.
I got special stickers for vans.
I got 28 van permits here.
- Start feeding me names.
is this Lieutenant Fisk?
Will Graham.
I need you to get the driver's licenses of these names.
The man we're looking for is blond, Caucasian, 20-40 years old, over six feet tall, 180-225 pounds.
First name?
A-L-V-A-R-O.
First name Joseph.
A-L-V-A-R-O, first name Joseph.
No.
Black hair.
No.
- Next.
Dillon, D-l-L-L-O-N.
First name Lincoln.
- Dillon.
D-l-L-L-O-N, first name Lincoln.
No.
Next.
Male, Caucasian, 6ft 7 inches, 217 pounds, eyes brown, hair blond.
34 years old.
- Put it through the data fax.
Fast!
Buckle up.
We're landing in Lambert Field.
Fogel has four more names.
Two have dark hair.
Third's a woman.
Fourth is a handicapped permit.
This is our man.
Rural Route 3, Chester, Missouri.
Where is that?
We're 10.25 at the Hock Road offramp, Highway 904.
Let's go!
Meeting point's up ahead.
- Go on to the house.
Lieutenant Fisk said ...
- Go on to the house!
Will?
Will, you won't need that.
The Swat Team will take him down, not us.
Will?
This ought to be it.
- Kill your lights!
Alright?
- l'm OK.
Griffin's hurt bad.
I'll wait for the back-up.
Set up a road block on Route 3!
We're in the trees west of the house.
How far away's the back-up?
I'm goin' around the back, stay here.
He's in there, Jack.
Someone is with him.
What?
Will, what did you say?
Wait for the back-up!
He's got someone with him, Jack.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Who are you?
Graham.
I'm Will Graham.
Looks worse, than it is.
See the turtles?
It was on the news.
I thought I'd work things out ... and call you after.
I thought I wouldn't wait.
How many of them made it?
Most of 'em.
We should've talked at the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk about it here.
I'm not falling all over myself to talk about it much of anywhere, Jack.
How much do you know?
Not much.
The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago.
The second one in Atlanta was all over TV.
Did you ever think about giving me a call?
No.
Why not?
I quit.
Remember?
You look all right now.
I am all right.
If you can't look anymore, I understand.
Don't try to run a game down on me, Jack.
If I really didn't need you to come back, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks and a few days until the next full moon.
We have a better chance to get him fast if you help.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
Hi, Molly.
Think it'll keep them out, Dad?
Yep.
How many turtle eggs do you think are in here?
In this hatchery?
I'll bet there's 40 or 50 of them.
Crabs get most of the newborns, huh?
Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it, guaranteed.
What about the dogs?
Are they gonna get in here?
They can't dig under.
That's why we bury the wire down in the sand.
We need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be his friend, Jack.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, Molly,
I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.
We got it pretty good, don't we?
We have it more than good.
All that happened to you before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only look at evidence.
I wouldn't get deeply involved.
He'd never even see me or know my name.
If they find him, they'll have to take him down, not me.
What do you think?
I think you've already decided and you're not really asking.
If I were asking?
Stay here with me, me and Kevin.
But it's selfish, and I know it.
Come here.
OFFICER:
I'll come inside with you, if you want, to show you around.
Mr. Crawford said maybe you'd want to be alone, but...
That's right.
There's a VCR hooked up in your hotel room.
They transferred some home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen sliding door.
Used a glass cutter anchored to a suction cup.
His entry was skillful.
All the prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair, strong, size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood AB positive, typed from saliva on glass from licking the suction cup.
Why didn't he care that he left saliva on the glass?
It was hot out that night, so inside the house must have felt cool to him.
Intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he was rising, then shot Mrs. Leeds.
Bullet entered right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation.
Moderate elevation of serotonin and marked increase of free histamine level in gunshot wound indicates she lived at least five minutes after she was shot.
All her other injuries were post-mortem.
Direction and velocity of bloodstains on east wall indicate arterial spray.
Even with his throat cut, Leeds tried to fight because the intruder was moving to the children's room.
Bloodstains on west wall of master bedroom and matted sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained, as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leeds' chest, also believed to be post-mortem.
What did the killer do with them after they were dead?
(PHONE RINGING)
VALERIE ON ANSWERING MACHINE:
HI, this is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry, I can't come to the phone right now, but if you'd like to leave a message please do so after the beep, and I'll call you back as soon as I can.
(ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS)
(DIAL TONE SOUNDING)
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Twenty-ninth floor.
Going UP-
When they were dead, he smashed the mirrors and began selecting pieces that he would use later on Mrs. Leeds.
(SIGHS)
Killing Mr. Leeds and the children would take less than a minute.
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem, four or five minutes later.
What did he do in the interval?
(SIGHS)
The smeared bloodstains on the west wall...
(SIGHS)
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
WILL:
Molly?
MOLLY.' Will, is that you?
Yeah, it's me, honey.
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
I love you.
I love you too, baby.
What are you dreaming?
That's something you can't afford for me to know about, isn't it?
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
It was maddening to have to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg, but there wasn't any talcum powder in the bathroom.
The talcum powder came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You touched her with your bare hands, and then you put your gloves back on.
But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so that they could see you?
JACK:
Hello?
Jack, this is Graham.
Is Price still in Latent Prints?
Yeah, he's in charge of the Single Print Index now.
What do you got, Will?
Get him to Atlanta.
Atlanta PD swears they dusted everything, and their guy is pretty good.
He is good.
He's not as good as Price.
I'll get him on a plane in the morning.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails and the corneas of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves.
Our people swear he wore surgeon's gloves the whole time.
They dusted everything.
Your report didn't mention eyes.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
WILL:
Because Mrs. Leeds was a beautiful woman.
This is what the subject's teeth looked like.
The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed these from the impressions that we took of the bite marks on the Leeds woman here and the Jacobi woman in Birmingham last month.
As you can see, he has pegged lateral incisors, that's these teeth here and here.
SPRINGFIELD:
Vice and Narcotics, you take the K-Y cowboys and leather bars.
Marcus, Whitman, heads up at the funeral.
The rest of your assignments are on the sheet.
Let's go.
One more thing.
I've heard officers referring to this killer as the Tooth Fairy.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Well, I don't want to hear that in public, and I don't want to see it in internal memoranda.
That's it.
(OFFICERS CHATTERING)
I know a burglar's gonna fence what he stole 'cause his motive is cash money.
I know his motive, so I go to work on fences.
This guy, we don't even have motive.
None of us have shit, and we know it.
WILL:
It's in his dreams.
His motive?
WILL:
Yeah.
His act fuels his fantasy.
Which is?
I don't know.
The commissioner was saying that you're the one who got Garrett Jacob Hobbs, and then Dr. Lecktor three years ago.
Lecktor killed nine people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
One's on a respirator at a hospital in Baltimore, the other's in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
(SNICKERS)
The psychologists call him a psychopath.
They don't know what else to call him.
I understand he out you pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's.
The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen.
The Jacobis in Birmingham had a cat, didn't they?
That's right.
We found a litter box downstairs, but we didn't find a cat.
Why don't you get Birmingham PD a methane probe out of Washington, have them cover the back yard.
Maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
(PHONE RINGING)
SPRINGFIELD:
Yeah?
OVER PHONE:
This is Jimmy Price, FBI.
Let me put you on speakerphone.
Who am I talking to?
Jimmy, it's Jack Crawford.
You got Will Graham here, too.
I got a partial print with a tented arch, it's probably a thumb.
And the fragment of a palm off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.
Thumbprint came off the oldest kid's left eye.
It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.
Can we make an identification off of it?
Maybe, if he's ever been printed and he's in my index.
I want to work these up in my own darkroom.
I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon.
Thanks, Jimmy.
(REPORTERS CHATTERING)
No comment.
JACK:
If we get lucky with that print, we're in, if Jimmy can find him in the index and if he's ever been printed.
If not, I don't know.
Hey, Will Graham!
What do you say?
You remember me?
Freddie Lounds, covered the Lecktor case for the Tattler, did the paperback.
So, Will, when did they call you in?
What do you got?
Hey, look, I'm buying lunch.
Lounds, why don't you give it a rest?
Hey, he's news.
I'm doing my job.
So, how does this guy compare with Lecktor?
How does he do them?
How's he do them, Will?
(GROANS)
Keep the fuck away from me.
JACK:
Will, Will.
Son of a bitch snuck into the hospital while I was sedated after Lecktor.
He pulled back the sheets, and he took pictures.
Yeah, I know.
Look, don't expect too much from me, all right?
We only got three weeks left, and you're our best shot.
You think I'm gonna see him standing in the street and say, "There he is"?
That's Houdini you're thinking about.
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on until we get smart or get lucky.
He won't stop.
Why?
He's got a genuine taste for it.
You do know something about him.
Not enough.
I think I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mindset.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Yeah, I keep getting it for Christmas.
Did you get my card?
I got it.
Thank you.
How is Officer Stewart?
The one who was first to see my basement.
Stewart's fine.
Emotional problems, I hear.
Do you have any problems, Will?
No.
No, of course you don't.
(SNICKERS)
I'm glad you came.
My callers are mostly clinical psychologists from cornfield universities somewhere.
Second-raters, the lot.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
And?
Very interesting.
Even to a layman.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Yes, I thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Yes?
You read about it?
In the papers.
I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
I thought you might have some ideas.
Why should I tell you?
You'd get to see the file on this case.
And there's another reason.
Pray tell.
Thought you might be curious to see if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
Then by implication you think you're smarter than me, since you caught me.
No.
I know that I'm not smarter than you.
Then how did you catch me?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantages?
You're insane.
You are very tan, Will.
Your hands are rough.
They don't look like cop's hands anymore.
And that shaving lotion is something a child would select.
It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it?
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
I don't think I'll persuade you at all.
You'll either do it or you won't.
Besides, we have Dr. Bloom working on it, and he's the best.
Do you have the file with you?
Yes.
Pictures?
Yes.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
No.
Dream much, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file, and I'll tell you what I think.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
(PAGES FLIPPING)
This is a very shy boy, Will.
What were their yards like?
Big back yards.
Fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, my dear Will, if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he might go outside to look at it.
Have you ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy for this sort of thing.
That's interesting.
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.
I considered it.
You came here to look at me, to get the old scent back again, didn't you?
I want your opinion.
I don't have one right now.
Well, when you have one, I'd like to hear it.
Can I keep this?
I haven't decided yet.
I'll study them.
When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too.
You can call me.
When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone.
Would you like to leave me your home phone number?
No.
Do you know how you caught me?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You can leave messages for me.
LECKTOR:
Do you know how you caught me?
The reason you caught me, Will, is we're just alike.
Do you understand?
Smell yourself.

What's his secretary's name again?
Martha King.
Just a moment, please.
WOMAN 3:
Martha King's desk.
Hi, Martha.
Martha doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob Greer of Blaine Edwards publishing company,
Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of The Psychiatrist and the Law to someone.
Martha never sent me the address and phone number.
She'll be in in the morning.
Well, I've got to catch Federal Express in about five minutes.
I'd be immensely appreciative if you could pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
I don't see a Rolodex.
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Yeah...
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
All right.
The name we're looking for, last name Graham, the man the book is supposed to be sent to, a Mr. Will Graham.

CAPTAIN ON PA SYSTEM:
Ladies and gentlemen, we are beginning our descent into Birmingham.
WILL:
You used a cutting tool on the branch so that you could see.
Then you passed the time whittling and dreaming.
When night came, you saw them pass by their bright windows.
Then you watched the shades go down, then you saw the lights go out, one by one.
Then after a while, you climbed down and you went in to them, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You watched them all goddamned day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
WILL:
I need Firearms and Tool Marks section out here on a severed branch.
I need to know what kind of cutting tool he used.
And then I need Bowman in Documents to fall on this carving.
JACK:
Is it weird?
The mark?
Yeah.
If Documents can't do the carving, I'll send it up to Langley.
WILL:
Did Price get an identification off the Leeds print?
No, Price hasn't found him in the index yet.
It's a hand search.
He's got half his department on it.
Listen, have you seen this week's Tattler?
(SCOFFS) It's not on my preferred reading list.
Well, your picture's all over the front page.
Who the hell was it?
Lounds?
Of course.
Who else?
God damn it, Jack!
I promised Molly!
I promised her!
Come in.
GUARD:
Dr. Chilton?
Yes?
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lecktor's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book.
We got him out of there and dug around.
Is that it?
Yes.
Put it down on my desk, Bonner.
Has anyone else seen this except you?
No.
SECRETARY:
Special Agent Crawford's office.
This is Dr. Chilton.
I need to speak to Mr. Graham right away.
He's not here, he's in Birmingham.
Special Agent Crawford is on the line with him now.
Please tell them this is very, very urgent.
I'll hold on.
Dr. Chilton, it's Jack Crawford.
You have Will Graham on the line, too.
CHILTON:
I have a note, or two pieces of a note that appears to be from that man who killed those people in Atlanta.
Where did you get it?
In Hannibal Lecktor's cell.
It was hidden in a book.
WILL:
Don't touch the note.
Can you read it to us?
It's written on toilet tissue.
"My dear Dr. Lecktor,"
"I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me."
"I know that you alone can understand what I am becoming."
"You alone know the people I use to help me in these things"
"are only elements undergoing change"
"to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming,"
"just as the source of light is burning."
"I have a collection of your press clippings."
"I think they are absurd, as are mine."
"'The Tooth Fairy, ' what could be more inappropriate?"
"Investigator Graham interests me,"
"very purposeful-looking."
"I hope we can correspond."
There's a piece missing here.
Now I'll read the bottom part.
"After I hear back from you,"
"I might send you something wet."
Signed "Avid Fan."
it has teeth marks pressed into it at the bottom.
Order a chopper, next thing smoking.
I don't care whose it is.
Two, call Alabama Air National Guard, get Graham back here right now.
Then call Documents and tell them to scramble a team.
I want everybody moving five minutes ago.
You understand?
JACK:
I have a Documents team on its way to you by helicopter to pick up the note.
Listen, after we've worked the note,
I want to replace it in Lecktor's cell.
I don't want Lecktor to know that we've found it, he might try to warn the killer somehow.
Where's Lecktor now?
CHILTON:
Holding cell.
How long can you keep him in there without him getting suspicious?
CHILTON:
Three, four hours.
Brian, we have a note coming in on the flight, possibly from the Tooth Fairy, number one priority.
It has to go to Hair and Fiber,
Latent Prints, and then Documents.
Will Graham and I will be walking it through.
One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.
And a couple of blue grains.
Work the hair.
What do we have for negative comparison?
Hair from Lecktor's comb, whiskers from Lecktor's razor they let him use.
This is hair from the security guard.
MAN:
How many guys handled this without gloves?
The guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
The cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had the oil washed off his fingers.
But the others...
One smudge.
Those aren't ridges.
It's just the texture of the paper.
I can fume for a print, but can't guarantee the iodine stains would fade out.
Ninhydrin?
Boost it with heat?
No.
We couldn't wash it after.
I can't get a print off this in the time you've got to get it back, Will.
BOWMAN:
How long do I have?
JACK:
Twenty minutes, max.
BOWMAN:
The main thing to find out is, how was Lecktor supposed to reply to him?
Which is probably the missing section, because at the top it says,
"I hope we can correspond," then comes the gap.
This note was written in ballpoint, but it looks like Lecktor went over this area with a felt-tip pen, then tore it away.
You're so sly, but so am I.
The aniline dyes used in the ink of the felt-tip pens like Lecktor used are transparent to infrared.
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.
This looks like the tip of a T here, here, and here.
At the end is what could be the top of an R.
There's three Ts and an R in "Tattler."
We know our boy reads it.
The article about me and Lecktor.
I don't know anybody else that's carried that.
Personal ads.
We believe the Tooth Fairy told Lecktor to reply to him through the personal ad section of the National Tattler.
The Chicago office is down there right now running through their ads.
We have cut into a line of communication between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor.
If we find Lecktor's reply we plan to pull it, substitute it with one of our own.
And this is what the Tooth Fairy will read.
Bill?
"Dear Avid Fan, inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements."
"Mementoes for you at Baltimore Central Left Luggage."
"Ticket number 72683."
It's a Secret Service letter drop.
We plan to stake it out.
When he shows, we'll grab him.
Anything from Chicago?
SARAH:
Not yet.
When do they go to press?
JACK:
Thirty-five minutes.
Christ.
Let's get to the physical.
There was no print.
Scale counts and core size of the hair match the blond hair found in the Jacobis'.
That note was written by your man.
Aside from the hair, three blue grains, dark flecks, went to Brian's end.
The grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine, from the cleaning man.
Several particles of dried blood, but not enough to type.
(PHONE RINGING)
OVER PHONE:
This is Chester.
Who am I talking to?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford.
Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in it being telexed to you right now.
Read it.
"Dear Avid Fan,"
"You honor me.
You're very beautiful."
JACK:
Oh, Christ.
"I offer 100 prayers for your safety."
"Find help in Galatians 6:11, 15:2,"
"Acts 3:3, Revelations 18:7,"
"Jonah 6:8, John 6:22,"
"Luke 1:7."
JACK:
Thanks.
Jimmy.
Did you get anywhere at all identifying him off the Leeds' prints?
Not yet.
Photography at Langley?
They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.
No.
And our ad has to go out in the same book code Lecktor used, or he'll know it wasn't Lecktor talking to him.
Book code?
"100 prayers" could be the page number, the paired numbers could be line and letter.
But what book?
JACK:
Not the Bible?
No.
Galatians 15:2.
Galatians only has six chapters.
The same with Jonah 6:8.
Jonah only has four chapters.
Lecktor was not using the Bible.
Then the Tooth Fairy probably named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
Right.
What about sweating Lecktor?
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.
He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
JACK:
Wonderful.
The Tooth Fairy would have named a book he knew Lecktor has access to.
He'd know it from articles he'd read about Lecktor.
JACK:
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they can get everything back in place.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books.
JACK:
Where?
BOWMAN:
Library of Congress.
Twenty-five minutes.
He won't make it in time.
Lecktor's ad runs as is, we decode it later.
Or we pull it, figure out the code and run our own ad next week.
And lose a week?
We got 17 days till the next full moon.
And I don't like Lecktor's ad running without knowing what it says.
It's your call, Will.
Run it.
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something else beside write?
We'll all feel sick for a very long time.
JACK:
And if Bowman still can't figure it out?
Then we'll bait him with something else in next week's Tattler.
JACK:
What, for instance?
Me.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
Why not?
Don't you think we can provoke him?
Maybe.
Maybe he can be provoked.
What I was thinking about is you.
You're getting deeper and deeper into this.
Good night.
Sidney.
I'll talk to you.
Last time you did that you did a real good job of pushing yourself all out of shape.
You try it on again or you go through some big trauma, you could relapse, my friend.
Sidney, don't worry about me.
I'm working the evidence, making moves.
That's all.
I'm fine.
Bowman just struck out.
It is not books in Lecktor's cell.
Price?
He just heard.
It's a bust-out.
As evidence, the Leeds print will get us a conviction if we could ever find the guy.
But he must never have been printed because he is not in our index.
We are not gonna identify him off the print.
I'll use Lounds.
What for?
Our boy doesn't read the New York Times literary supplement.
He reads Lounds in the Tattler.
What else should we cover?
He put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.
I believe he did this to make sure we wouldn't think he was gay.
He's molested all of his male victims.
He may be impotent with members of the opposite sex.
Our forensic psychologists have projected, though I'm not sure, that he may have had sexual relations with his mother.
(LAUGHS)
So, how long do you plan to stay in Washington?
Till we've taken out the Tooth Fairy.
LOUNDS:
Can the Tattler rely on getting the straight stuff from you?
Absolutely.
How does working on this case affect your sex life?
Mine?
it doesn't affect mine, it affects yours.
Go fuck yourself.
Look, pal of mine, you're news.
Shoot the pictures.
All right, Symie, let's shoot them.
I'm in the shots with Graham.
What?
I'm in the shots with you.
Come on, you want this to look real or not?
Make sure the theater sign across the street is just slightly out of focus.
We want him to be able to read it so he can find it, but we don't want to look too obvious.
You make sure that I look excellent.
All right, shoot it.
One more.
One more.
That's enough.
Okay, Graham.
Hey, always nice, huh?
Let's have lunch, call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.
Dr. Bloom.
I need them on my desk in two hours.
Did Bowman break the code yet?
No.
Tools and Firearms say the cutting tool used on the severed branch was a common bolt cutter.
I got a call from Asian Studies at Langley.
The mark you found on the tree?
Yeah?
It's a Chinese character considered a lucky sign in gambling.
That same character appears on a Mah Jongg piece.
It means "Red Dragon." Mean anything to you?
No.
If he shows, and he's smart, he'll approach you from the front, pass, turn, try and take you from behind.
How's your hearing?
It's good.
You'll wear a wire, one-way.
We'll hear you, you won't hear us.
You checked out a Charter Arms .44
Special Bulldog?
Yeah.
Load these in it.
You ever fire them?
Glaser Safety Slugs.
Yeah.
Number 12 shots.
Suspended in liquid Teflon in a copper casing.
On impact it all opens up in the target.

You got body armor?
Yeah, Kevlar Second Chance.
I hope you get one.
'Cause he's gone for the head shot eight of eleven times?

Yes.
Do you imply that I'm queer?
God, no.
Before me, you are a slug in the sun.
You are privy to a great becoming, and you recognize nothing.
You are an ant in the afterbirth.
It is your nature to do one thing correctly, tremble.
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, Lounds, you and the others, you owe me awe.
We have one more piece of work to do.
If he takes off the mask, lam a dead man.

Open your eyes!
You will read this into the tape recorder.
Go.
"I have had a great privilege."
"I have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the Red Dragon."
"All I wrote about him were lies."
"Will Graham made me write them"
"to pull him into a trap in Washington, District of Columbia."
"Will Graham, you will learn from my own lips"
"how much you have to dread because I was forced to lie."
"He will be more merciful to me than to you."
"You will lie awake in fear of what the Red Dragon will do."
"I will be a testament to the truth of this."
(SHUDDERING)
You did very well.
Will you let me go now?
Please?
You will tell the truth?
I promise.
Good.
We'll seal your promise with...
We'll seal your promise with a kiss.

Bowman, just skip the cryptography and tell me what the hell it says, okay?
Did he try to say anything at all?
No, he sure didn't.
He never regained consciousness.
Did you hear the tape?
Yeah.
Listen, Bowman just broke the code that Lecktor used in the Tattler personal ad.
It was the State of Maryland statutes.
You need to know what it said right now.
What?
Listen to me.
Everything is okay.
I've taken care of it.
What is it, Jack?
The bastard gave him your home address.
It said, "Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway",
"Captiva, Florida."
"Save yourself.
Kill them all."
Get me a plane.
Will!
Mom.
Huh?
What time...
What?
Someone's outside.
There are noises.
Where?
Outside.
(WHISPERING) Mom...
Go back to your room and close the door.
Mom...
Do it now.
Ma'am, are you all right?
What?
What is it?
What is it?
What's going on?
OFFICER:
Ma'am, I think you should come back inside.
What's going on?
Come back inside.
Please.
I think you should come back inside.
I'm sorry, Molly.
I'm sorry about all of this.
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.
He's after you now, isn't he?
This is just a precaution.
Kevin, why don't you run down to the water, check out the dock?
I want to hang around here.
I'm in the kitchen, Mom.
Okay.
What is that about?
What, he's afraid to leave you alone with me now?
He saw the article in the Tattler, right?
I wanted to talk with him about it, but he said he wanted to bring it up to you, face to face.
Good for him.
Kevin, help me unpack, will you?
Then we'll go get some groceries.
You and Mom are very well-protected, you know.
No one's gonna find out where you are.
KEVIN:
ls there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
No.
KEVIN:
This guy is trying to kill us?
We don't know that.
When are you going to kill him?
I'm not.
It's only my job to find him.
Barry's mom had this newspaper.
It said you were in a special hospital.
Well, it was a regular hospital, then I was transferred into the psychiatric wing.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
I don't know.
Was it because in the papers it said it was this man Lecktor?
Mmm-hmm.
What happened?
Well, Lecktor was attacking college girls, then he killed them.
How?
In bad ways.
He was a psychiatrist.
One of the girls was his patient, and I went to talk to him about her.
I tried to build feelings in my imagination like the killer had so that I would know why he did what he did, because that would help me find him.
When I was sitting in Lecktor's office and I looked up, I saw a book on his shelf.
It had pictures of war wounds in it.
And I knew it was him.
So I went to a pay phone down the hall to call the police and that's when he attacked me.
You and Mom came to see me in the hospital, and that helped a lot.
But after my body got okay,
I still had his thoughts going around in my head.
And I stopped talking to people.
And a doctor friend of mine, a Dr. Bloom, asked me to get some help.
And I did.
Then after a while I felt better, and I was okay again.
And the way he thought felt that bad?
Kevin, they're the ugliest thoughts in the world.
So, what kind of coffee do you like?
You like that Folgers stuff, right?
Yeah.
Mom likes that, too.
When can we go home, Dad?
I don't know, Kevin.
So, where are things?
Nowhere.
Everything we've tried is either a dead end or it's backfired.
Crawford's already planning the next crime scene so they can get it fresh.
We've got about six more days till the next full moon.
Can you quit?
No.
What's next?
I go to Atlanta.
Crawford?
No.
I have to be alone.
You're talking about doing exactly what you said you...
This killing, it's gotta stop.
William, you're gonna make yourself sick.
Or get yourself killed.
You and Kevin should go to Montana.
See your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.
And I'll come up and get you afterwards.
(WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA SYSTEM)
VALERIE ON ANSWERING MACHINE:
HI, this is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry I can't come to the phone right now.
I'm sorry, too.
WAITRESS:
Excuse me.
Coffee.
It's just you and me now, sport.
I'm gonna find you, God damn it.
Mr. Dollarhyde?
Eileen.
Bill told me to tell you there was a variation in the gamma of number three.
But he caught it in time.
Eileen, good.
Good.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
REBA:
Who's there?
Mr. Dollarhyde.
I came about the low-light infrared emulsion.
REBA:
Oh, yeah.
Come on in, it's safe.
Put your back against the door.
There's a stool just to your right.
You're the production controller from Admin, right?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions?
Shooting from maybe eight feet.
I can't use any lights.
Okay, what's being photographed?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
Four days.
Okay, let me stick this in the black hole.
1000-C infrared sensitive has to be handled in total darkness.
Remember to be very careful with it.
But still, it's easier to handle than the 1200 series.
It'll be fine.
In case you're wondering,
I keep the samples straight by touch code.
No, I wasn't wondering.
Reba, I gotta fly.
Maybe Mr. Dollarhyde can drive you home tonight.
No, that's okay.
I'll take care of myself.
RALPH:
I can change things around.
No, thanks, go on.
Okay.
I'll take you.
No, thanks.
I'll order you 1200 feet of 1000-C in the morning.
Ride with me.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus.
I do it all the time.
Ride with me.
It would be because I would like you to.
Okay, sure.
Let me get my stuff on.
How did you come to Gateway?
Oh, they had to hire the handicapped to shape up their employment practices to get this defense contract.
You worked out well.
Everybody they hired did.
You know, you speak very well.
Although you avoid fricatives and sibilants.
At the Riker Institute for the Blind,
I trained in therapy for speech- and hearing-impaired children.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Mmm-hmm.
You know, if you don't want to talk, that's okay.
But I hope you will, because you're very direct, and I like that, and I like what you have to say.
May I touch your face?
I want to know whether you're smiling or frowning.
I guess I want to know whether I should be quiet or not.
Take my word for it.
I'm smiling.
I didn't mean to offend you.
On the way, can I take you somewhere?
Where?
It would be my surprise.
Okay, sure.
Are you apprehensive?
No.
The very protective Mr. Dollarhyde over there is watching us.
No, no, I want to.
In about two hours we're going to cap his tooth.
REBA:
Yeah.
DOCTOR:
It's warm.
(HEART BEATING)
Back a little bit.
There.
You hear it?
Yeah.
You rearrange the dead families into an audience to see what you do.
You think that what you do will make you into something different.
You are becoming.
What is it you think you're becoming?
The answer is in the way you use the mirrors.
What do the mirrors make you dream you're becoming?
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)
A little to your left.
Francis, that was a great dinner.
Thank you.
I made you a gin and tonic.
It's right in front of you.
What are you watching?
It's just a little homework.
(THIS BIG HUSH PLAYING)
(INHALES DEEPLY)
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, D.
Is there a fire in the sky?
Your heart's loud.
Is there a moon up there?
If you'll hold me...
Is anything alive now?
This darkness is what I hear
This is a breathless silence
A moment out of time
I see your face in the shadows
The tell-tale signs are in your eyes
Aching with a passion inside
Deep as the river
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
Is there a flame in the dark?
Is there a bright heart star?
These creatures look the same now
We freeze wherever we are
We wake alone in the blackness
We sleep wherever we fall
One dream all around us
This big hush infects us all
Forever in this half-light
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
(CRYING)
And the light from you
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
REBA:
Is that you, D?
DOLLARHYDE:
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Hi.
(DOLLARHYDE CHUCKLES)
Good morning.
Morning.
You know, if you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee.
No, no...
Don't go back inside the house.
Why?
I left my purse inside.
I'll get it.
It's okay.
I mean, you should stay outside, it's...
It's...
It's 'cause you look so good in the sun.
(LAUGHING) Okay.
(SIGHS)
When...
Reba, when can I see you again?
Oh!
Um...
We could meet at my house.
JACK OVER PHONE:
You got the message Lecktor called?
Yeah.
I arranged for him to have a phone.
I gotta call him in a few minutes.
Good.
Listen, we identified the tire tracks left when Lounds was delivered back to the Tamer.
G-7816 Goodyear truck tires.
Looks like our boy drives a van.
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you coming back?
When I'm done, Jack.
(PHONE RINGING)
Yeah, this is Will Graham of the FBI.
Dr. Chilton arranged for me to talk to Dr. Lecktor.
Hello?
LECKTOR:
Hello, Will.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds.
I admire that enormously.
Oh, what a cunning boy you are.
I'm sick of you crazy sons of bitches.
You got something to say, say it.
I want to help you.
You'd be more comfortable if you relax with yourself.
We don't invent our natures, they're issued to us, along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else.
Why fight it?
Fight what?
Did you really feel so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death?
I didn't know you then, but I think you probably did.
But it wasn't the act that got you down, was it?
Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?
And why shouldn't it feel good?
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.
God's terrific.
He dropped a church roof on 34 of his worshippers last Wednesday night in Texas as they were groveling through a hymn to his majesty.
Don't you think that felt good?
Why does it feel good, Dr. Lecktor?
It feels good, Will, because God has power.
And if one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.
He got 140 Filipinos in one plane crash last month.
Remember that earthquake in Italy last spring?
WILL:
I enter.
The glass cutter.
The piece of glass I take out is mine.
The house is mine.
I walk up these stairs,
I pass the children's toys.
The children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.
I move to the door.
I step into the room.
I see you there.
And I see me desired by you.
Accepted and loved in the silver mirrors of your eyes.
(STRONG AS I AM PLAYING)
(CAR APPROACHING)
Father, look in my eyes
See me as I really am
You made me
Now take me
RALPH:
I'm gonna talk to Fogel tomorrow...
Tell me how it feels now
Behold your flesh has come of age
RALPH:
Wait a minute.
Forsake me, you break me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that scares me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that dares me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that haunts me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that taunts me
Mother, let me heal you
Your pain has lasted far too long
Release it, it kills you
What was it?
Pollen.
Oh.
Thanks for the ride.
See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
The love you would not share grows tired of waiting
(GASPS)
Mr. Dollarhyde.
What are you doing here?
(GUN FIRING)
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that scares me
Strong as I am
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
REBA:
Who is it?
DOLLARHYDE:
It's me.
Who?
Who is it?
DOLLARHYDE:
It's me.
Oh.
Francis?
No, not Francis.
Francis is gone.
Francis is gone forever.
So, what are we doing?
The dream.
He dreams about being wanted and desired, so he changes people into beings who want and desire him.
Changes?
It's a word.
Killing and arranging the people to imitate it.
And Lecktor told me something.
If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
You put it together, you get, if our boy imitates being wanted and desired enough times, he believes he will become one who is wanted and desired and accepted.
It'll all come true.
This started from an abused kid, a battered infant.
There's something terrible about...
JACK:
What, are you sympathizing with this guy now?
Absolutely.
My heart bleeds for him as a child.
Someone took a kid and manufactured a monster.
At the same time, as an adult, he's irredeemable.
He butchers whole families to pursue trivial fantasies.
As an adult, someone should blow this sick fuck out of his socks.
Do you think that's a contradiction, Jack?
Does this kind of understanding make you uncomfortable?
What about the mirrors?
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.
But he doesn't take anything.
There's no souvenirs taken from the houses.
He needs souvenirs or trophies to re-live the event.
Maybe he records it somehow.
So he could see himself accepted over and over and over again.
VTRs, Polaroids, stills, what?
How do I know?
How does he find them?
When we find out how he found them, we'll find him.
There is no connection between the two families.
We've done a dozen computer runs.
Jack, all the women have a bloom on them.
He didn't win them in a lottery, he picked these women.
There's selection and design in his choices.
Look, admit we struck out this month.
The Lear Jet is standing by, the basic lab stuff is on it.
You, Zeller, Jimmy Price, the photographer, anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and 15 minutes.
We get the call, we roll.
The scene will be fresher than we've ever had it.
It's not over yet.
For Christ's sake!
That's a foregone conclusion.
It's 11:30 p.m., the full moon is happening tonight.
Give it up!
Forget this month, it's too damn late!
I gave it up.
Till you showed up with pictures of two dead families, knowing goddamn well that I'd imagine families three, four, five and six.
Right?
You're fucking right I did, and I'd do it again!
Great!
But don't talk to me about late, pal,
I'll tell you when it's too fucking late!
Until then, we go as late as I want to take it!
(WILL SIGHS)
A padlock.
That's why the bolt cutter.
What's that?
He used a bolt cutter to trim away the branch when he was watching from the woods.
Why didn't he use the bolt cutter on the garage door?
Because a deadbolt was there when they were killed.
Donald Jacobi's 12th birthday party was April 14th.
Sometime between April 14th and August 1 they changed the lock.
But he thought there was a padlock there.
From the street, you can't see the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door.
There's a big, high fence there.
But he was ready with his glass cutter.
So either he was casing far ahead and we didn't check back far enough,
Or...
JACK:
We checked.
Don't talk.
Metcalfe, is the Leeds and Jacobi stuff still in the storeroom?
Have the guard down there call me.
Do it.
You know that's the Jacobis' cat.
You brought a bolt cutter 'cause you thought there was a padlock.
The Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog, don't you, my man?
See the woman?
The bloom on the woman?
You can see her again and again anytime you want.
Doggie doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog.
And the Jacobi cat.
And the padlock on the door.
And you know you need a bolt cutter and every other goddamn thing because everything with you is seeing, isn't it?
Your primary sensory intake that makes your dream live is seeing.
Reflections, mirrors, images...
You've seen these films.
Haven't you, my man?
(PHONE RINGING)
It's the guard in the storeroom.
The cans.
What cans?
The tapes were transferred from home movies.
Where's the packaging the films came in?
There's films of the families in the document storage.
Find them.
You got them?
Are there any labels?
Leeds can, Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
The Jacobi label will say the same thing as the Leeds label.
Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
JACK:
Who processed the Jacobi film?
No.
Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.
Stores send them out.
Have him peel the top label back.
JACK:
ls there a label underneath?
It does, doesn't it?
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes to Meigs Field.
At Meigs Field,
I want the Lear Jet prepped and a plan filed with St. Louis.
Where are you?
Are you here?
(IN-A-GADDA-DA-VIDA PLAYING)
You're scaring me with this!
Will you just stop it?
Francis, why are you doing this to me?
It's ugly!
Don't you know that I'll always be true?
Are you in this room?
Where are you?
You answer me!
And take my hand
Oh, won't you come with me
And walk this land
Please, take my hand

We should've talked at the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk about it here.
I'm not falling all over myself to talk about it much of anywhere, Jack.
How much do you know?
Not much.
The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago.
The second one in Atlanta was all over TV.
Did you ever think about giving me a call?
No.
Why not?
I quit.
Remember?
You look all right now.
I am all right.
If you can't look anymore, I understand.
Don't try to run a game down on me, Jack.
If I really didn't need you to come back, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks and a few days until the next full moon.
We have a better chance to get him fast if you help.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
Hi, Molly.
Think it'll keep them out, Dad?
Yep.
How many turtle eggs do you think are in here?
In this hatchery?
I'll bet there's 40 or 50 of them.
Crabs get most of the newborns, huh?
Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it, guaranteed.
What about the dogs?
Are they gonna get in here?
They can't dig under.
That's why we bury the wire down in the sand.
We need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be his friend, Jack.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, Molly,
I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.
We got it pretty good, don't we?
We have it more than good.
All that happened to you before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only look at evidence.
I wouldn't get deeply involved.
He'd never even see me or know my name.
If they find him, they'll have to take him down, not me.
What do you think?
I think you've already decided and you're not really asking.
If I were asking?
Stay here with me, me and Kevin.
But it's selfish, and I know it.
Come here.
OFFICER:
I'll come inside with you, if you want, to show you around.
Mr. Crawford said maybe you'd want to be alone, but...
That's right.
There's a VCR hooked up in your hotel room.
They transferred some home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen sliding door.
Used a glass cutter anchored to a suction cup.
His entry was skillful.
All the prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair, strong, size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood AB positive, typed from saliva on glass from licking the suction cup.
Why didn't he care that he left saliva on the glass?
It was hot out that night, so inside the house must have felt cool to him.
Intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he was rising, then shot Mrs. Leeds.
Bullet entered right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation.
Moderate elevation of serotonin and marked increase of free histamine level in gunshot wound indicates she lived at least five minutes after she was shot.
All her other injuries were post-mortem.
Direction and velocity of bloodstains on east wall indicate arterial spray.
Even with his throat cut, Leeds tried to fight because the intruder was moving to the children's room.
Bloodstains on west wall of master bedroom and matted sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained,
as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leeds' chest, also believed to be post-mortem.
What did the killer do with them after they were dead?

What are you dreaming?
That's something you can't afford for me to know about, isn't it?
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
It was maddening to have to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg, but there wasn't any talcum powder in the bathroom.
The talcum powder came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You touched her with your bare hands, and then you put your gloves back on.
But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so that they could see you?
JACK:
Hello?
Jack, this is Graham.
Is Price still in Latent Prints?
Yeah, he's in charge of the Single Print Index now.
What do you got, Will?
Get him to Atlanta.
Atlanta PD swears they dusted everything, and their guy is pretty good.
He is good.
He's not as good as Price.
I'll get him on a plane in the morning.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails and the corneas of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves.
Our people swear he wore surgeon's gloves the whole time.
They dusted everything.
Your report didn't mention eyes.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
WILL:
Because Mrs. Leeds was a beautiful woman.
This is what the subject's teeth looked like.
The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed these from the impressions that we took of the bite marks on the Leeds woman here and the Jacobi woman in Birmingham last month.
As you can see, he has pegged lateral incisors, that's these teeth here and here.

None of us have shit, and we know it.

It's in his dreams.
His motive?
WILL:
Yeah.
His act fuels his fantasy.
Which is?
I don't know.
The commissioner was saying that you're the one who got Garrett Jacob Hobbs, and then Dr. Lecktor three years ago.
Lecktor killed nine people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
One's on a respirator at a hospital in Baltimore, the other's in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
(SNICKERS)
The psychologists call him a psychopath.
They don't know what else to call him.
I understand he cut you pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's.
The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen.
The Jacobis in Birmingham had a cat, didn't they?
That's right.
We found a litter box downstairs, but we didn't find a cat.
Why don't you get Birmingham PD a methane probe out of Washington, have them cover the back yard.
Maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.

Thumbprint came off the oldest kid's left eye.
It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.
Can we make an identification off of it?
Maybe, if he's ever been printed and he's in my index.
I want to work these up in my own darkroom.
I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon.
Thanks, Jimmy.
(REPORTERS CHATTERING)
No comment.
JACK:
If we get lucky with that print, we're in, if Jimmy can find him in the index and if he's ever been printed.
If not, I don't know.
Hey, Will Graham!
What do you say?
You remember me?
Freddie Lounds, covered the Lecktor case for the Tattler, did the paperback.
So, Will, when did they call you in?
What do you got?
Hey, look, I'm buying lunch.
Lounds, why don't you give it a rest?
Hey, he's news.
I'm doing my job.
So, how does this guy compare with Lecktor?
How does he do them?
How's he do them, Will?
(GROANS)
Keep the fuck away from me.
JACK:
Will, Will.
Son of a bitch snuck into the hospital while I was sedated after Lecktor.
He pulled back the sheets, and he took pictures.
Yeah, I know.
Look, don't expect too much from me, all right?
We only got three weeks left, and you're our best shot.
You think I'm gonna see him standing in the street and say, "There he is"?
That's Houdini you're thinking about.
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on until we get smart or get lucky.
He won't stop.
Why?
He's got a genuine taste for it.
You do know something about him.
Not enough.
I think I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mindset.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Yeah, I keep getting it for Christmas.
Did you get my card?
I got it.
Thank you.
How is Officer Stewart?
The one who was first to see my basement.
Stewart's fine.
Emotional problems, I hear.
Do you have any problems, Will?
No.
No, of course you don't.
(SNICKERS)
I'm glad you came.
My callers are mostly clinical psychologists from cornfield universities somewhere.
Second-raters, the lot.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
And?
Very interesting.
Even to a layman.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Yes, I thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Yes?
You read about it?
In the papers.
I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
I thought you might have some ideas.
Why should I tell you?
You'd get to see the file on this case.
And there's another reason.
Pray tell.
Thought you might be curious to see if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
Then by implication you think you're smarter than me, since you caught me.
No.
I know that I'm not smarter than you.
Then how did you catch me?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantages?
You're insane.
You are very tan, Will.
Your hands are rough.
They don't look like cop's hands anymore.
And that shaving lotion is something a child would select.
It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it?
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
I don't think I'll persuade you at all.
You'll either do it or you won't.
Besides, we have Dr. Bloom working on it, and he's the best.
Do you have the file with you?
Yes.
Pictures?
Yes.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
No.
Dream much, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file, and I'll tell you what I think.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
(PAGES FLIPPING)
This is a very shy boy, Will.
What were their yards like?
Big back yards.
Fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, my dear Will, if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he might go outside to look at it.
Have you ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy for this sort of thing.
That's interesting.
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.
I considered it.
You came here to look at me, to get the old scent back again, didn't you?
I want your opinion.
I don't have one right now.
Well, when you have one, I'd like to hear it.
Can I keep this?
I haven't decided yet.
I'll study them.
When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too.
You can call me.
When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone.
Would you like to leave me your home phone number?
No.
Do you know how you caught me?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You can leave messages for me.
LECKTOR:
Do you know how you caught me?
The reason you caught me, Will, is we're just alike.
Do you understand?
Smell yourself.

Hi, Martha.
Martha doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob Greer of Blaine Edwards publishing company,
Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of The Psychiatrist and the Law to someone.
Martha never sent me the address and phone number.
She'll be in in the morning.
Well, I've got to catch Federal Express in about five minutes.
I'd be immensely appreciative if you could pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
I don't see a Rolodex.

CAPTAIN ON PA SYSTEM:
Ladies and gentlemen, we are beginning our descent into Birmingham.
WILL:
You used a cutting tool on the branch so that you could see.
Then you passed the time whittling and dreaming.
When night came, you saw them pass by their bright windows.
Then you watched the shades go down, then you saw the lights go out, one by one.
Then after a while, you climbed down and you went in to them, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You watched them all goddamned day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
WILL:
I need Firearms and Tool Marks section out here on a severed branch.
I need to know what kind of cutting tool he used.
And then I need Bowman in Documents to fall on this carving.
JACK:
Is it weird?
The mark?
Yeah.
If Documents can't do the carving, I'll send it up to Langley.
WILL:
Did Price get an identification off the Leeds print?
No, Price hasn't found him in the index yet.
It's a hand search.
He's got half his department on it.
Listen, have you seen this week's Tattler?
(SCOFFS) It's not on my preferred reading list.
Well, your picture's all over the front page.
Who the hell was it?
Lounds?
Of course.
Who else?
God damn it, Jack!
I promised Molly!
I promised her!
Come in.
GUARD:
Dr. Chilton?
Yes?
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lecktor's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book.
We got him out of there and dug around.
Is that it?
Yes.
Put it down on my desk, Bonner.
Has anyone else seen this except you?
No.
SECRETARY:
Special Agent Crawford's office.
This is Dr. Chilton.
I need to speak to Mr. Graham right away.
He's not here, he's in Birmingham.
Special Agent Crawford is on the line with him now.
Please tell them this is very, very urgent.
I'll hold on.
Dr. Chilton, it's Jack Crawford.
You have Will Graham on the line, too.
CHILTON:
I have a note, or two pieces of a note that appears to be from that man who killed those people in Atlanta.
Where did you get it?
In Hannibal Lecktor's cell.
It was hidden in a book.
WILL:
Don't touch the note.
Can you read it to us?
It's written on toilet tissue.
"My dear Dr. Lecktor,
"I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me.
"I know that you alone can understand what I am becoming.
"You alone know the people I use to help me in these things
"are only elements undergoing change
"to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming,
"just as the source of light is burning.
"I have a collection of your press clippings.
"I think they are absurd, as are mine.
"'The Tooth Fairy,' what could be more inappropriate?
"Investigator Graham interests me,
"very purposeful-looking.
"I hope we can correspond."
There's a piece missing here.
Now I'll read the bottom part.
"After I hear back from you,
"I might send you something wet."
Signed "Avid Fan."
It has teeth marks pressed into it at the bottom.
Order a chopper, next thing smoking.
I don't care whose it is.
Two, call Alabama Air National Guard, get Graham back here right now.
Then call Documents and tell them to scramble a team.
I want everybody moving five minutes ago.
You understand?
JACK:
I have a Documents team on its way to you by helicopter to pick up the note.
Listen, after we've worked the note,
I want to replace it in Lecktor's cell.
I don't want Lecktor to know that we've found it, he might try to warn the killer somehow.
Where's Lecktor now?
CHILTON:
Holding cell.
How long can you keep him in there without him getting suspicious?
CHILTON:
Three, four hours.
Brian, we have a note coming in on the flight, possibly from the Tooth Fairy, number one priority.
It has to go to Hair and Fiber,
Latent Prints, and then Documents.
Will Graham and I will be walking it through.
One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.
And a couple of blue grains.
Work the hair.
What do we have for negative comparison?
Hair from Lecktor's comb, whiskers from Lecktor's razor they let him use.
This is hair from the security guard.
MAN:
How many guys handled this without gloves?
The guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
The cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had the oil washed off his fingers.
But the others...
One smudge.
Those aren't ridges.
It's just the texture of the paper.
I can fume for a print, but can't guarantee the iodine stains would fade out.
Ninhydrin?
Boost it with heat?
No.
We couldn't wash it after.
I can't get a print off this in the time you've got to get it back, Will.
BOWMAN:
How long do I have?
JACK:
Twenty minutes, max.
BOWMAN:
The main thing to find out is, how was Lecktor supposed to reply to him?
Which is probably the missing section, because at the top it says,
"I hope we can correspond," then comes the gap.
This note was written in ballpoint, but it looks like Lecktor went over this area with a felt-tip pen, then tore it away.
You're so sly, but so am I.
The aniline dyes used in the ink of the felt-tip pens like Lecktor used are transparent to infrared.
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.
This looks like the tip of a T here, here, and here.
At the end is what could be the top of an R.
There's three Ts and an R in "Tattler."
We know our boy reads it.
The article about me and Lecktor.
I don't know anybody else that's carried that.
Personal ads.
We believe the Tooth Fairy told Lecktor to reply to him through the personal ad section of the National Tattler.
The Chicago office is down there right now running through their ads.
We have cut into a line of communication between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor.
If we find Lecktor's reply we plan to pull it, substitute it with one of our own.
And this is what the Tooth Fairy will read.
Bill?
"Dear Avid Fan, inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements.
"Mementoes for you at Baltimore Central Left Luggage.
"Ticket number 72683."
It's a Secret Service letter drop.
We plan to stake it out.
When he shows, we'll grab him.
Anything from Chicago?
SARAH:
Not yet.
When do they go to press?
JACK:
Thirty-five minutes.
Christ.
Let's get to the physical.
There was no print.
Scale counts and core size of the hair match the blond hair found in the Jacobis'.
That note was written by your man.
Aside from the hair, three blue grains, dark flecks, went to Brian's end.
The grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine, from the cleaning man.
Several particles of dried blood, but not enough to type.
(PHONE RINGING)
OVER PHONE:
This is Chester.
Who am I talking to?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford.
Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in it being telexed to you right now.
Read it.
"Dear Avid Fan,
"You honor me.
You're very beautiful."
JACK:
Oh, Christ.
"I offer 100 prayers for your safety.
"Find help in Galatians 6: 11, 15:2,
"Acts 3:3, Revelations 18:7,
"Jonah 6:8, John 6:22,
"Luke 1:7."
JACK:
Thanks.
Jimmy.
Did you get anywhere at all identifying him off the Leeds' prints?
Not yet.
Photography at Langley?
They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.
No.
And our ad has to go out in the same book code Lecktor used, or he'll know it wasn't Lecktor talking to him.
Book code?
"100 prayers" could be the page number, the paired numbers could be line and letter.
But what book?
JACK:
Not the Bible?
No.
Galatians 15:2.
Galatians only has six chapters.
The same with Jonah 6:8.
Jonah only has four chapters.
Lecktor was not using the Bible.
Then the Tooth Fairy probably named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
Right.
What about sweating Lecktor?
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.
He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
JACK:
Wonderful.
The Tooth Fairy would have named a book he knew Lecktor has access to.
He'd know it from articles he'd read about Lecktor.
JACK:
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they can get everything back in place.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books.
JACK:
Where?
BOWMAN:
Library of Congress.
Twenty-five minutes.
He won't make it in time.
Lecktor's ad runs as is, we decode it later.
Or we pull it, figure out the code and run our own ad next week.
And lose a week?
We got 17 days till the next full moon.
And I don't like Lecktor's ad running without knowing what it says.
It's your call, Will.
Run it.
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something else beside write?
We'll all feel sick for a very long time.
JACK:
And if Bowman still can't figure it out?
Then we'll bait him with something else in next week's Tattler.
JACK:
What, for instance?
Me.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
Why not?
Don't you think we can provoke him?
Maybe.
Maybe he can be provoked.
What I was thinking about is you.
You're getting deeper and deeper into this.
Good night.
Sidney.
I'll talk to you.
Last time you did that you did a real good job of pushing yourself all out of shape.
You try it on again or you go through some big trauma, you could relapse, my friend.
Sidney, don't worry about me.
I'm working the evidence, making moves.
That's all.
I'm fine.
Bowman just struck out.
It is not books in Lecktor's cell.
Price?
He just heard.
It's a bust-out.
As evidence, the Leeds print will get us a conviction if we could ever find the guy.
But he must never have been printed because he is not in our index.
We are not gonna identify him off the print.
I'll use Lounds.
What for?
Our boy doesn't read the New York Times literary supplement.
He reads Lounds in the Tattler.
What else should we cover?
He put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.
I believe he did this to make sure we wouldn't think he was gay.
He's molested all of his male victims.
He may be impotent with members of the opposite sex.
Our forensic psychologists have projected, though I'm not sure, that he may have had sexual relations with his mother.
(LAUGHS)
So, how long do you plan to stay in Washington?
Till we've taken out the Tooth Fairy.
LOUNDS:
Can the Tattler rely on getting the straight stuff from you?
Absolutely.
How does working on this case affect your sex life?
Mine?
It doesn't affect mine, it affects yours.
Go fuck yourself.
Look, pal of mine, you're news.
Shoot the pictures.
All right, Symie, let's shoot them.
I'm in the shots with Graham.
What?
I'm in the shots with you.
Come on, you want this to look real or not?
Make sure the theater sign across the street is just slightly out of focus.
We want him to be able to read it so he can find it, but we don't want to look too obvious.
You make sure that I look excellent.
All right, shoot it.
One more.
One more.
That's enough.
Okay, Graham.
Hey, always nice, huh?
Let's have lunch, call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.
Dr. Bloom.
I need them on my desk in two hours.
Did Bowman break the code yet?
No.
Tools and Firearms say the cutting tool used on the severed branch was a common bolt cutter.
I got a call from Asian Studies at Langley.
The mark you found on the tree?
Yeah?
It's a Chinese character considered a lucky sign in gambling.
That same character appears on a Mah Jongg piece.
It means "Red Dragon." Mean anything to you?
No.
If he shows, and he's smart, he'll approach you from the front, pass, turn, try and take you from behind.
How's your hearing?
It's good.
You'll wear a wire, one-way.
We'll hear you, you won't hear us.
You checked out a Charter Arms .44 Special Bulldog?
Yeah.
Load these in it.
You ever fire them?
Glaser Safety Slugs.
Yeah.
Number 12 shots.
Suspended in liquid Teflon in a copper casing.
On impact it all opens up in the target.

You got body armor?
Yeah, Kevlar Second Chance.

Bowman, just skip the cryptography and tell me what the hell it says, okay?
Did he try to say anything at all?
No, he sure didn't.
He never regained consciousness.
Did you hear the tape?
Yeah.
Listen, Bowman just broke the code that Lecktor used in the Tattler personal ad.
It was the State of Maryland statutes.
You need to know what it said right now.
What?
Listen to me.
Everything is okay.
I've taken care of it.
What is it, Jack?
The bastard gave him your home address.
It said, "Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway,
"Captiva, Florida.
"Save yourself.

Will!

Huh?
What time...
What?

There are noises.
Where?
Outside.
(WHISPERING) Mom...

Mom...
Do it now.
Ma'am, are you all right?
What?
What is it?
What is it?
What's going on?
OFFICER:
Ma'am, I think you should come back inside.
What's going on?
Come back inside.
Please.
I think you should come back inside.
I'm sorry, Molly.
I'm sorry about all of this.
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.
He's after you now, isn't he?
This is just a precaution.
Kevin, why don't you run down to the water, check out the dock?
I want to hang around here.
I'm in the kitchen, Mom.
Okay.
What is that about?
What, he's afraid to leave you alone with me now?
He saw the article in the Tattler, right?
I wanted to talk with him about it, but he said he wanted to bring it up to you, face to face.
Good for him.
Kevin, help me unpack, will you?
Then we'll go get some groceries.
You and Mom are very well-protected, you know.
No one's gonna find out where you are.
KEVIN:
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
No.
KEVIN:
This guy is trying to kill us?
We don't know that.
When are you going to kill him?
I'm not.
It's only my job to find him.
Barry's mom had this newspaper.
It said you were in a special hospital.
Well, it was a regular hospital, then I was transferred into the psychiatric wing.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
I don't know.
Was it because in the papers it said it was this man Lecktor?
Mmm-hmm.
What happened?
Well, Lecktor was attacking college girls, then he killed them.
How?
In bad ways.
He was a psychiatrist.
One of the girls was his patient, and I went to talk to him about her.
I tried to build feelings in my imagination like the killer had so that I would know why he did what he did, because that would help me find him.
When I was sitting in Lecktor's office and I looked up, I saw a book on his shelf.
It had pictures of war wounds in it.
And I knew it was him.
So I went to a pay phone down the hall to call the police and that's when he attacked me.
You and Mom came to see me in the hospital, and that helped a lot.
But after my body got okay,
I still had his thoughts going around in my head.
And I stopped talking to people.
And a doctor friend of mine, a Dr. Bloom, asked me to get some help.
And I did.
Then after a while I felt better, and I was okay again.
And the way he thought felt that bad?
Kevin, they're the ugliest thoughts in the world.
So, what kind of coffee do you like?
You like that Folgers stuff, right?
Yeah.
Mom likes that, too.
When can we go home, Dad?
I don't know, Kevin.
So, where are things?
Nowhere.
Everything we've tried is either a dead end or it's backfired.
Crawford's already planning the next crime scene so they can get it fresh.
We've got about six more days till the next full moon.
Can you quit?
No.
What's next?
I go to Atlanta.
Crawford?
No.
I have to be alone.
You're talking about doing exactly what you said you...
This killing, it's gotta stop.
William, you're gonna make yourself sick.
Or get yourself killed.
You and Kevin should go to Montana.
See your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.
And I'll come up and get you afterwards.

I came about the low-light infrared emulsion.
REBA:
Oh, yeah.
Come on in, it's safe.
Put your back against the door.
There's a stool just to your right.
You're the production controller from Admin, right?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions?
Shooting from maybe eight feet.
I can't use any lights.
Okay, what's being photographed?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
Four days.
Okay, let me stick this in the black hole.
1000-C infrared sensitive has to be handled in total darkness.
Remember to be very careful with it.
But still, it's easier to handle than the 1200 series.
It'll be fine.
In case you're wondering,
I keep the samples straight by touch code.
No, I wasn't wondering.
Reba, I gotta fly.
Maybe Mr. Dollarhyde can drive you home tonight.
No, that's okay.
I'll take care of myself.
RALPH:
I can change things around.
No, thanks, go on.
Okay.
I'll take you.
No, thanks.
I'll order you 1200 feet of 1000-C in the morning.
Ride with me.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus.
I do it all the time.
Ride with me.
It would be because I would like you to.
Okay, sure.
Let me get my stuff on.
How did you come to Gateway?
Oh, they had to hire the handicapped to shape up their employment practices to get this defense contract.
You worked out well.
Everybody they hired did.
You know, you speak very well.
Although you avoid fricatives and sibilants.
At the Riker Institute for the Blind,
I trained in therapy for speech- and hearing-impaired children.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Mmm-hmm.
You know, if you don't want to talk, that's okay.
But I hope you will, because you're very direct, and I like that, and I like what you have to say.
May I touch your face?
I want to know whether you're smiling or frowning.
I guess I want to know whether I should be quiet or not.
Take my word for it.
I'm smiling.
I didn't mean to offend you.
On the way, can I take you somewhere?
Where?
It would be my surprise.
Okay, sure.
Are you apprehensive?
No.
The very protective Mr. Dollarhyde over there is watching us.
No, no, I want to.
In about two hours we're going to cap his tooth.
REBA:
Yeah.
DOCTOR:
It's warm.
(HEART BEATING)
Back a little bit.
There.
You hear it?
Yeah.
You rearrange the dead families into an audience to see what you do.
You think that what you do will make you into something different.
You are becoming.
What is it you think you're becoming?
The answer is in the way you use the mirrors.
What do the mirrors make you dream you're becoming?
(PROJECTOR WHIRRING)
A little to your left.
Francis, that was a great dinner.
Thank you.
I made you a gin and tonic.
It's right in front of you.
What are you watching?
It's just a little homework.
(THIS BIG HUSH PLAYING)
(INHALES DEEPLY)
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, D.
Is there a fire in the sky?
Your heart's loud.
Is there a moon up there?
If you'll hold me...
Is anything alive now?
This darkness is what I hear
This is a breathless silence
A moment out of time
I see your face in the shadows
The tell-tale signs are in your eyes
Aching with a passion inside
Deep as the river
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
Is there a flame in the dark?
Is there a bright heart star?
These creatures look the same now
We freeze wherever we are
We wake alone in the blackness
We sleep wherever we fall
One dream all around us
This big hush infects us all
Forever in this half-light
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
(CRYING)
And the light from you
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
REBA:
Is that you, D?
DOLLARHYDE:
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Hi.
(DOLLARHYDE CHUCKLES)
Good morning.
Morning.
You know, if you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee.
No, no...
Don't go back inside the house.
Why?
I left my purse inside.
I'll get it.
It's okay.
I mean, you should stay outside, it's...
It's...
It's 'cause you look so good in the sun.
(LAUGHING) Okay.
(SIGHS)
When...
Reba, when can I see you again?
Oh!
Um...
We could meet at my house.
JACK OVER PHONE:
You got the message Lecktor called?
Yeah.
I arranged for him to have a phone.
I gotta call him in a few minutes.
Good.
Listen, we identified the tire tracks left when Lounds was delivered back to the Tattler.
G-7816 Goodyear truck tires.
Looks like our boy drives a van.
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you coming back?
When I'm done, Jack.
(PHONE RINGING)
Yeah, this is Will Graham of the FBI.
Dr. Chilton arranged for me to talk to Dr. Lecktor.
Hello?
LECKTOR:
Hello, Will.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds.
I admire that enormously.
Oh, what a cunning boy you are.
I'm sick of you crazy sons of bitches.
You got something to say, say it.
I want to help you.
You'd be more comfortable if you relax with yourself.
We don't invent our natures, they're issued to us, along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else.
Why fight it?
Fight what?
Did you really feel so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death?
I didn't know you then, but I think you probably did.
But it wasn't the act that got you down, was it?
Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?
And why shouldn't it feel good?
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.
God's terrific.
He dropped a church roof on 34 of his worshippers last Wednesday night in Texas as they were groveling through a hymn to his majesty.
Don't you think that felt good?
Why does it feel good, Dr. Lecktor?
It feels good, Will, because God has power.
And if one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.
He got 140 Filipinos in one plane crash last month.
Remember that earthquake in Italy last spring?
WILL:
I enter.
The glass cutter.
The piece of glass I take out is mine.
The house is mine.
I walk up these stairs,
I pass the children's toys.
The children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.
I move to the door.
I step into the room.
I see you there.
And I see me desired by you.
Accepted and loved in the silver mirrors of your eyes.
(STRONG AS I AM PLAYING)
(CAR APPROACHING)
Father, look in my eyes
See me as I really am
You made me
Now take me
RALPH:
I'm gonna talk to Fogel tomorrow...
Tell me how it feels now
Behold your flesh has come of age
RALPH:
Wait a minute.
Forsake me, you break me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that scares me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that dares me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that haunts me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that taunts me
Mother, let me heal you
Your pain has lasted far too long
Release it, it kills you
What was it?
Pollen.
Oh.
Thanks for the ride.
See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
The love you would not share grows tired of waiting
(GASPS)
Mr. Dollarhyde.
What are you doing here?
(GUN FIRING)
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that scares me
Strong as I am
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
REBA:
Who is it?
DOLLARHYDE:
It's me.
Who?
Who is it?
DOLLARHYDE:
It's me.
Oh.
Francis?
No, not Francis.
Francis is gone.
Francis is gone forever.
So, what are we doing?
The dream.
He dreams about being wanted and desired, so he changes people into beings who want and desire him.
Changes?
It's a word.
Killing and arranging the people to imitate it.
And Lecktor told me something.
If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
You put it together, you get, if our boy imitates being wanted and desired enough times, he believes he will become one who is wanted and desired and accepted.
It'll all come true.
This started from an abused kid, a battered infant.
There's something terrible about...
JACK:
What, are you sympathizing with this guy now?
Absolutely.
My heart bleeds for him as a child.
Someone took a kid and manufactured a monster.
At the same time, as an adult, he's irredeemable.
He butchers whole families to pursue trivial fantasies.
As an adult, someone should blow this sick fuck out of his socks.
Do you think that's a contradiction, Jack?
Does this kind of understanding make you uncomfortable?
What about the mirrors?
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.
But he doesn't take anything.
There's no souvenirs taken from the houses.
He needs souvenirs or trophies to re-live the event.
Maybe he records it somehow.
So he could see himself accepted over and over and over again.
VTRs, Polaroids, stills, what?
How do I know?
How does he find them?
When we find out how he found them, we'll find him.
There is no connection between the two families.
We've done a dozen computer runs.
Jack, all the women have a bloom on them.
He didn't win them in a lottery, he picked these women.
There's selection and design in his choices.
Look, admit we struck out this month.
The Lear Jet is standing by, the basic lab stuff is on it.
You, Zeller, Jimmy Price, the photographer, anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and 15 minutes.
We get the call, we roll.
The scene will be fresher than we've ever had it.
It's not over yet.
For Christ's sake!
That's a foregone conclusion.
It's 11:30 p.m., the full moon is happening tonight.
Give it up!
Forget this month, it's too damn late!
I gave it up.
Till you showed up with pictures of two dead families, knowing goddamn well that I'd imagine families three, four, five and six.
Right?
You're fucking right I did, and I'd do it again!
Great!
But don't talk to me about late, pal,
I'll tell you when it's too fucking late!
Until then, we go as late as I want to take it!
(WILL SIGHS)
A padlock.
That's why the bolt cutter.
What's that?
He used a bolt cutter to trim away the branch when he was watching from the woods.
Why didn't he use the bolt cutter on the garage door?
Because a deadbolt was there when they were killed.
Donald Jacobi's 12th birthday party was April 14th.
Sometime between April 14th and August 1 they changed the lock.
But he thought there was a padlock there.
From the street, you can't see the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door.
There's a big, high fence there.
But he was ready with his glass cutter.
So either he was casing far ahead and we didn't check back far enough,
or...
JACK:
We checked.
Don't talk.
Metcalfe, is the Leeds and Jacobi stuff still in the storeroom?
Have the guard down there call me.
Do it.
You know that's the Jacobis' cat.
You brought a bolt cutter 'cause you thought there was a padlock.
The Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog, don't you, my man?
See the woman?
The bloom on the woman?
You can see her again and again anytime you want.
Doggie doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog.
And the Jacobi cat.
And the padlock on the door.
And you know you need a bolt cutter and every other goddamn thing because everything with you is seeing, isn't it?
Your primary sensory intake that makes your dream live is seeing.
Reflections, mirrors, images...
You've seen these films.
Haven't you, my man?
(PHONE RINGING)
It's the guard in the storeroom.
The cans.
What cans?
The tapes were transferred from home movies.
Where's the packaging the films came in?
There's films of the families in the document storage.
Find them.
You got them?
Are there any labels?
Leeds can, Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
The Jacobi label will say the same thing as the Leeds label.
Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
JACK:
Who processed the Jacobi film?
No.
Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.
Stores send them out.
Have him peel the top label back.
JACK:
Is there a label underneath?
It does, doesn't it?
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes to Meigs Field.
At Meigs Field,
I want the Lear Jet prepped and a plan filed with St. Louis.
Where are you?
Are you here?
(IN-A-GADDA-DA-VIDA PLAYING)
You're scaring me with this!
Will you just stop it?
Francis, why are you doing this to me?
It's ugly!
Don't you know that I'll always be true?
Are you in this room?
Where are you?
You answer me!
And take my hand
Oh, won't you come with me
And walk this land
Please, take my hand
(EXHALES)
JACK:
We're looking for a man.
We know he works at Gateway.
We don't have his name, but we know he drives a van.
MAN OVER PHONE:
Under "Employee Facilities,"
I've got special stickers for vans.
Yeah, I got 28, 29 van permits in the computer.
JACK:
Start feeding me names.
Is this Lieutenant Fisk?
Will Graham.
Listen, I need you to punch up the driver's licenses of the names I'm gonna feed you.

Fogel has four more names.
He knows two, both dark hair, third's a woman, fourth is a handicapped parking permit.
This is our man.

We'll 10-25 at the Hark Road off ramp, Highway 94.

I'm going around the back.
Stay in the trees.
He's in there, Jack.
And he's got somebody in there with him.

We should have talked to the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk here.
I'm not falling over to talk about it much anywhere, Jack.
How much do you know?
- Not much.
The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago, and Atlanta was all over TV.
Did you think about giving me a call?
- No.
- Why not?
I quit, remember?
You look alright now.
I am alright.
If you can't look anymore, I understand.
Don't play games with me!
If I really didn't need you, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks till full moon.
We have a better chance if you help me.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
Think it'll keep them out, Dad?
- Yep.
How many turtle's eggs are in here?
- ln this hatchery?
40 or 50 of 'em.
Crabs get most of them, huh?
- Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it.
What about the dogs?
No.
That's why we buried the wire down in the sand.
I need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be his friend.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, Molly, I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.
We've got it pretty good.
- More than good.
All that happened before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only look at the evidence.
I wouldn't get involved.
He'd never even see me.
If they find him, they'll have to take him down.
What do you think?
You've already decided and you're not really asking.
If I were asking?
Stay here with me.
Me and Kevin.
That's selfish and I know it.
I'll come inside with you and show you around.
Mr. Crawford said maybe you want to be alone.
- That's right.
There's a VCR in your hotel room.
There's home movies of both families on half inch VHS.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen door.
Used a glass cutter on a suction cup.
Entry was skilful.
All prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair, strong.
Size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood AB positive, from saliva on glass from the suction cup.
Why did he leave saliva on the glass?
It was hot that night, so it must have felt cool in the house.
Intruder cut Charles Leeds's throat then shot Mrs. Leeds.
Bullet lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation.
Moderate elevation of serotonin and an increase in histamine indicate she lived for 5 minutes after the shot.
All other injuries are post-mortem.
Direction of the blood stains on the wall indicate arterial spray.
Leeds tried to fight because intruder moved towards the children's room.
Blood stains on west wall in master bedroom and sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained,
as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leeds' chest.
Also believed post-mortem.
What did the killer do with them after they were dead?
Hi.
This is Valerie Leeds.
I can't speak right now, but if you leave a message after the beep, I'll get right back.
290th floor.
Going up.
When they were dead, he smashed the mirrors and selected pieces for use on Mrs. Leeds.
Killing Mr. Leeds and the children would take less than a minute.
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem 4 or 5 minutes later.
What did he do in the interval?
He smeared blood stains on the wall.
Hello?
- Molly?
Will, is that you?
- Yeah, honey.
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
I love you.
- l love you too, baby.
What are you dreaming?
That's something you can't afford for me to know about.
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
lr was maddening to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg, but there wasn't any in the bathroom.
It came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you?
You touched her with your bare hands and then you put your gloves back on!
But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so they could see you?
Hallo?
- Jack, this is Graham.
is Price still in Latent Prints?
- Yeah, the Single Print Index.
What have you got?
- Get him to Atlanta.
Atlanta P. D. dusted everything and they're good.
- Not as good as Price.
I'll send him tomorrow.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails and the corneas of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves.
The subject's teeth look like this.
These were reconstructed from the bite mark impressions we took from Mrs. Leeds and the Jacobi woman.
He has pegged lateral incisors, that's these teeth here and here.
Vice and narcotics, you take the K-Y cowboys and the leather bars.
Marcus, Whitman heads up at the funeral.
The rest, see the sheet.
One more thing.
I've heard officers call this killer the 'Tooth Fairy'.
Well, I don't wanna hear that in public or see it in memoranda!
That's it.
I know a burglar's gonna fence what he stole for cash money.
I know his motive, so I go to work on fences.
This guy, we don't have a motive.
None of us have shit and we know it.
It's in his dreams.
His motive?
- Yeah.
His act fuels his fantasy.
Which is?
- l don't know.
Commissioner says you're the one who got Garrett Jacob Hobbes and then Dr. Lecktor 3 years ago?
- Lecktor killed 90 people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
I heard he cut you pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's.
It has puncture wound.
The Jacobis had a cat.
That's right.
We found the litter box, but not the cat.
Give Birmingham P. D. a methane probe out of Washington.
Have them cover the backyard.
Maybe the cat's buried there.
Yeah?
- This is Jimmie Price, fbi.
Let me put you on the speaker.
- Who am I talking to?
Jack Crawford and Will Graham.
I got a partial print, probably a thumb.
And a fragment of a palm off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.
Thumb print came off the oldest kid's left eye.
Can we make an identification off it?
- Maybe if he's in my index.
Wanna work on these in the dark room.
I'll fax the prints this afternoon.
- Thanks.
If we get lucky with that print ... lf Jimmie can find him in the index.
- Hey, Graham!
Whatta you say?
It's me, Lounds, from the "Tattler".
I did the Lecktor paperback.
When did they call you in?
I'm buying lunch, alright?
- Give it a rest!
I'm doing my job.
How does he compare to Lecktor?
What does he do to them?
How does he do 'em, Will?
Keep the fuck away from me!
- Will, Will!
Son-of-a-bitch snuck into the hospital while I was sedated and took pictures.
I know.
- Don't expect too much from me.
We only got three weeks left.
- You think I'm just gonna see him?
That's Houdini!
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on till we get smart or lucky.
He won't stop.
Why?
He's got a taste for it.
- You do know something about him.
Not enough.
I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mind set.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court 3 years ago.
I keep getting it for Christmas.
Did you get my card?
- l got it, thank you.
How is Officer Stuart?
Fine.
- Emotional problems, I hear.
Do you have any problems, Will?
- No.
No, of course you don't.
I'm glad you came.
My callers are usually psychologists from cornfield universities.
Second-raters, the lot.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction.
- And?
Very interesting, even to a layman.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
- l thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
- Yes?
- You read about it?
In the papers.
I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing them.
Any ideas?
- Why should I tell you?
You get to see the file.
There's another reason.
- Pray tell.
You might be curious to see if you're smarter.
Smarter than you, since you caught me?
I know I'm not smart.
- Then how did you catch me?
Your disadvantages.
- What disadvantages?
You're insane.
You're very tanned, Will.
Your hands are rough.
Not cop's hands any more.
And that shaving lotion is from a child?
With a ship on the bottle?
Don't think appeals to my intellectual vanity will work.
I don't think that.
You'll do it or you won't.
Dr. Bloom's working on it.
He's the best.
Have you got the file?
- Yes.
- Pictures?
- Yes.
Let me have them and I'll consider it.
- No.
Dream much, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file and I'll tell you what I think.
This is a very shy boy.
What were the yards like?
- Big, fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, if he imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he'll go look outside.
Ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy.
Interesting.
No.
You thought of it before.
- l considered it.
You wanted to look at me.
To get the scent back.
- l want your opinion.
I don't have one now.
- When you do, I want to hear it.
Can I keep this?
- Haven't decided.- l'll study them.
Also any other files.
You can call me.
For calls to my lawyer I get a phone.
Will you leave me your home number?
No.
Do you know how you caught me?
There's a number on the file.
- Do you know how you caught me?
You caught me, Will, because we're just alike.
You want the scent, smell yourself!
Gotcha!
Get up and face the wall.
Don't turn around, or I'll mace you in the face.
Thank you so much.
I'll call when I'm finished.
You ready for your call?
- Yes, thank you.
Paltrow, Christiansen and Golub, Law Offices.
I'm sorry, I misdialed.
Thank you for using ATT.
This is Operator 24.
Operator, I don't have the use of my arms.
Would you dial a number for me?
- Certainly.
What's the number?
Area code 3-0-1.
5-5-5-6-6-2-4.
University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry.
- Dr. Bloom, please.
I'll connect you with his office.
What's his secretary's name?
- Martha King.
Just a moment.
Martha King's desk.
- Hi, Martha.
Martha doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob Greer.
Dr. Bloom asked me to send a paper to someone, but I never got the address or number.
- She'll be in in the morning.
I've got to catch the Federal express.
Could you pull it out of her Rolodex?
I don't see a Rolodex.
- l bet she has a call caddy.
Yeah.
- Well point right on down to G.
Alright.
- The last name is Graham.
The man the book is for.
Mr. Will Graham.
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation, 10th and Pennsylvania, Washington D. C.
I bet his home address is there too.
3680 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida.
Thank you very much.
Finished!
Mommy!
- Oh my gosh!
It's alright.
Stewardess?
There's a couple down from Duluth, we were talking about mortgages.
And ... I figure, you're gonna unload this turkey.
Well, then the squad car rolls up, they start asking questions,
The the good old boys giving them the whole Grand Tour:
Who was lying where and what.
Terrific.
So they get in their sedan and get the hell out of here.
Any single men ask to see the house?
No-one asked me.
You cut the branch so you could see.
Then you passed the time whittling and dreaming.
When night came, you saw them behind bright windows.
You watched the shades go down, saw the lights go out one by one.
Then you went in to 'em, didn'tcha?
Didn't you, son-of-a-bitch?
You watched them all day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
I need the Firearms and Toolmarks Section on the severed branch.
I need Bowman to fall on this carving.
- ls it weird?
The mark?
Yeah.
If Documents can't do it, Langley can.
- Did Price get an identification?
No, not yet.
It's a hand search.
Have you seen the "Tattler"?
It's not on my reading list.
- Yeah, well, you're all over the front page.
Who the hell was it, Lounds?
- Who else?
Goddammit, Jack!
I promised Molly.
Come in!
- Dr. Chilton?
- Yes?
On cleaning out Dr. Lecktor's cell, he hid something in a book.
We dug around.
- ls that it?
Put it down.
Has anyone seen this except you?
- No.
Crawford's office.
- This is Chilton.
Mr. Graham please!
He's not here.
Mr. Crawford is on the line with him now.
Will you tell him this is very, very urgent.
I'll hold on.
Dr. Chilton, it's Crawford.
Graham is on the line, too.
I have two pieces of a note that appears to be from the murderer in Atlanta.
Where did you get it?
- Hidden in a book in Lecktor's cell.
Don't touch the note.
Read it to us!
- lt's on toilet tissue.
"Dear Dr. Lecktor, I am delighted that you've taken an interest in me.
You alone can understand what I am becoming.
You know the people I used to help me are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.
Just as the source of light is burning.
My collection of your press clippings is as absurd as are mine.
The "Tooth Fairy".
What could be more inappropriate?
Investigator Graham interests me.
Very purposeful-looking.
I hope we can correspond."
There's a piece missing.
I'll read the bottom part.
"After I hear from you, I might send you something wet."
Signed: "Avid fan." There are teeth marks at the bottom.
Order a chopper.
Don't care whose.
2.
Call Alabama Air National Guard, get Graham back here right now.
Call Documents and scramble a team.
I want everybody moving'.
The Documents team is underway to pick up the note.
Listen, I wanna replace the note.
I don't want Lecktor to know.
He might try to warn the killer.
Where's Lecktor?
- Holding cell.
How long can you keep him in there?
- Three, four hours.
We have a note coming in, possibly from the Tooth Fairy.
No. 1 Priority.
Has to go to Hair and Fiber.
One hair.
Maybe half an inch.
Couple of blue grains.
- Work the hair.
What do you have as a negative comparison?
- Lecktor's comb.
Whiskers from a razor, hair from the Security Guard.
How many handled this without gloves?
Guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
- The cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had the oil washed off his fingers.
But the others ...one smudge.
No ridges, it's just the texture of the paper.
I can fume it but I can't say the iodine stains will fade.
- Ninhydrin?
Boosted with heat?
- No.
You couldn't wash it out.
I can't get a print in the time.
How long?
- 20 minutes max.
Main thing is, how was Lecktor supposed to reply?
It's probably in the missing section.
'l hope we can correspond'.
Then comes the gap.
This note was written in ballpoint.
But it looks like Lecktor went over this area with a felt-tip pen and tore it away.
You're so sly, but so am I.
The aniline dyes in the felt-tip pens, like Lecktor used, are transparent to infrared.
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.
This looks like the tip of a T.
This one could be the top of an R.
- Three T's and an R in "Tattler".
The article about me and Lecktor.
No-one else carried that.
Personal ads.
The Tooth Fairy told Lecktor to reply through the Personal ads in the "Tattler".
Chicago is running through them right now.
Here is a line of communication between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor.
If we find Lecktor's answer, we'll replace it with our own.
This is what he'll read:
"Dear Avid Fan:
lnherit my mantle and surpass my achievements.
Mementos for you at Baltimore Central.
Left luggage.
Ticket 7-2-6-8-3."
It's a letter drop.
We stake it out and grab him.
Anything from Chicago?
- Not yet.
- When do they go to press?
In 35 minutes.
- Christ!
- Let's get to the physical.
There was no print.
- The core size of the hair matches the blond hair found in the Jacobi's.
Your man wrote the note.
Three blue grains went to Brians's end.
Commercial granulated cleanser from the cleaning man.
Particles of dried blood, but not enough to type.
This is Chester, who's there?
- Will Graham, Jack Crawford.
Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in it.
- Read it!
"Dear Avid Fan, you honor me.
You're very beautiful.
One hundred prayers for your safety.
Find help in Galatians 6, 11 and 15,2.
Acts 3,3;
Revelations 18,7.
Jonah 6,8;
John 6,22;
Luke 1,7.
Thanks.
Jimmie,
Get anywhere with the Leeds print?
- Not yet.
Cryptography at Langley?
- They're working on the telex now.
No.
Our ad has to go out in the same book code, or he'll know.
Book code?
"100 prayers" could be a page number and the paired numbers lines.
Galatians only has six chapters.
Same with Jonah, it only has four.
Lecktor was not using the Bible.
The Tooth Fairy probably named the book in the part torn out.
What about sweating' Lecktor?
We tried sodium amytal 3 years ago, and he gave 'em a recipe for a chip dip.
- Wonderful.
The Tooth Fairy knows which book.
He'd know from articles about Lecktor.
Willingham took Polaroids of Lecktor's cell.
Have him meet me.
- Where?
- Library of Congress.
25 minutes.
He won't make it.
Lecktor's ad runs as is, or we pull it and run our own ad next week.
- We got 17 days left till full moon!
I don't like Lecktor's ad running without knowing what it says.
It's your call, Will.
Run it.
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something else?
Then we'll all feel sick.
And if Bowman can't figure it out?
Then we'll bait him with something else in the "Tattler".
- What?
Me.
That's not a very good idea.
Why not?
Won't it provoke him?
- Maybe.
I was thinking about you.
You're getting in deeper and deeper.
Sidney?
The last time you pushed yourself all outta shape.
Try it on again, or if you go through some trauma, you could relapse.
Sidney, don't worry about me.
I'm workin' the evidence, makin' moves, that's all.
I'm fine.
Bowman says it is not books in Lecktor's cell.
Price?
- lt's a bust out.
The Leeds' print will get us a conviction.
He must never have been printed, because he is not in our index.
We are not gonna identify him off the print.
I'll use Lounds.
What for?
Our boy doesn't read the Times.
He reads Lounds in the "Tattler".
What else should we cover?
- He put the shorts on Leeds after he was dead, so we wouldn't think he was gay.
He molested all his male victims and may be impotent with women.
Our forensic psychologists have projected that he may have had sexual relations with his mother.
How long will you stay in Washington?
- Till we've got the Tooth Fairy.
Will the "Tattler" get the stuff?
How's your sex life been affected?
Mine?
It doesn't.
It affects yours!
Fuck yourself!
Look, pal, you're news!
- You shot the pictures.
Alright.
I'm in the shots with Graham.
- What?
- Yeah.
Come on!
You want this to look real?
Make sure the theater sign is just out of focus.
We want him to read it.
- And make sure I look excellent!
Shoot it!
One more.
One more.
- That's enough.
OK, Graham.
Always nice, huh?
Let's have lunch, call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.
Dr. Bloom.
I need them on my desk in 2 hours.
- OK.
Did Bowman break the code yet?
- No.
They say the cutting tool was a common bolt cutter.
I got a call from Asian Studies in Langley.
The mark on the tree is a Chinese lucky sign in gambling.
The same character appears in Mah-jongg.
It means Red Dragon.
Mean anything to you?
No.
If he shows and he's smart, he'll approach from the front, pass, turn and try and take you from behind.
How's your hearing?
- Good.
You'll wear a wire, one way.
We'll hear you, but you won't hear us.
Checked out a 44 Special Bulldog?
Load these in it.
You ever fire 'em?
- Glaser safety slugs?
Opens up on impact.
Guaranteed one shot stop.
You got body armor?
- Kevlar Second Chance.
Hope you get one.
- 'Cause he goes for the head shot?
Let's walk the route.
United Flight 8490 to Newark now boarding at gate 7.
United Flight 8490 to Newark now boarding at gate 7.
Can you get to a phone?
So where are things?
Got nine days left.
We're working on it.
You don't wanna talk about what you're doing, do you?
Hotel rooms ...
An illicit romance ...
We have to stop meeting like this.
Remember the first time we met?
Yeah.
We were alone together in that room.
Though I'd never seen you before, we were sitting there, speaking.
A shadow flickered across your face.
I said, "What's that?"
Remember what you said?
I said:
"This is too good to believe."
Time is luck, Will.
You know the value of every day.
Someone's coming.
Go!
Don't!
Don't move!
Take the money!
Don't shoot!
Clear!
Quicker, man!
I'm being mugged!
Do you know who I am?
- l don't wanna know who you are.
You said I'm a sexual pervert.
'An animal' you said.
Do you know who I am now?
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Open your eyes!
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.
That's why you're here.
Open your eyes or I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Well, here I ... am.
Look at the screen.
William Blake's
'The Great Red Dragon' and 'The Woman Clothed in the Rays of the Sun'.
Do you see?
- Yes.
Mrs. Leeds.
Do you see?
- Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi.
Do you see?
- Yes.
The next family as they will look.
Do you see?
- Yes.
Mrs. Leeds, later.
Her husband beside her.
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.
The Dragon rampant.
Freddie Lounds.
Your photograph.
No!
- No what?
- Not me, please!
Please!
- Are you a man?
- Yes.
Do you imply that I'm queer?
- God, no!
Before me you are a slug in the sun.
You are privy to a great becoming and you recognise nothing!
You are an ant in the afterbirth!
It is your nature to do one thing correctly... tremble.
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, Lounds, you and the others you owe me awe!
We've one more piece of work to do.
If he takes off the mask, I'm dead now!
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!
Read this into the tape recorder.
Go.
"l have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the Red Dragon.
All I wrote about him were lies.
Will Graham made me write them to pull him into a trap.
Will Graham, you will learn how much you have to dread, because I lied.
He will be more merciful to me.
You will lie awake in fear of what the Red Dragon will do.
I will testify to the truth of this."
You did very well.
Will you let me go now?
Please?
- You will tell the truth?
- l promise.
Good.
We'll seal your promise with ...
We'll seal your promise
with a kiss.
Only five answers are possible.
Any member of a team may buzz in and answer.
Bowman, skip the cryptography and tell me what it says!
- Did he try to say anything at all?
- No.
- He never regained consciousness.
Did you hear the tape?
- Yes.
Listen,
Bowman just broke Lecktor's code in the personal ad.
- lt's the State of Maryland Statutes.
You need to know, now.
- What?
Listen to me.
Everything's okay.
I've taken care of it.
What is it, Jack?
The bastard gave him your address.
It said: "Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida."
Save yourself.
Kill them all.
- Get me a plane!
- Will!
Will!
Mom?
Huh?
What?
Someone's outside.
- l hear noises.
- Where?
- Outside.
Go back to your room and close the door.
- Mom?
- Do it, now!
- Mom, are you alright?
- What?
What is it?
What is it?
What's going on?
Come back inside!
- What's going on?
- Come inside!
- So what ...?
- Come back inside!
I'm sorry, Molly.
I'm sorry about all of this.
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.
- He's after you now, isn't he?
- lt's just a precaution.
Kevin?
Run down to the water and check the out dock.
I wanna hang around here.
I'm in the kitchen, mom.
What's that about?
He's afraid to leave you alone with me now?
He saw the article in the "Tattler".
I wanted to talk to him, but he said he'd bring it up with you.
Good for him.
Kevin, help me unpack and then we'll get some groceries.
You and mom are well protected.
No one's gonna find you.
is there anything I need to know, to see about mom?
No.
- This guy's planning to kill us?
- We don't know that.
When you gonna kill him?
I'm not.
It's only my job to find him.
In the newspaper it said you were in a special hospital.
Well, it was a regular hospital, then I was transferred to the psychiatric wing.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
I don't know.
Was it because of this man Lecktor?
What happened?
Lecktor attacked college girls and he killed them.
How?
In bad ways.
He was a psychiatrist.
One of the girls was his patient and I went to talk to him about her.
I tried to build up feelings like the killer had, so I would know why he did it 'cause that would help me find him.
I was sitting in Lecktor's office and saw a book on a shelf with pictures of war wounds.
And I knew it was him.
So I went to a pay phone to call the police.
That's when he attacked me.
You and mom ... came to see me in hospital and that helped a lot.
But after my body got OK, I still had his thoughts in my head.
I stopped talking to people.
A doctor friend, Dr. Bloom asked me to get help, and I did.
And after a while I felt better and I was OK again.
And the way you thought ...
felt that bad?
Kevin, the ugliest thoughts in the world.
What kind of coffee you like?
What?
- You like that Folger's stuff, right?
- Yeah.
Mom too.
- When can we go home, Dad?
- l don't know, Kevin.
So where are things?
Nowhere.
Everything we've tried is a dead end or has backfired.
Crawford is planning the next crime scene.
- Six days till full moon.
- Can you quit?
No.
What's next?
- l go to Atlanta.
- Crawford?
No.
I have to be alone.
- You're talking about doing exactly what ...
- This killing it's gotta stop!
William, you're going to make yourself sick, or get killed.
You and Kevin should go to Montana, see your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.
I'll come and get you afterwards.
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
I'm sorry I can't come to the phone.
- l'm sorry too.
- Excuse me?
- Coffee.
Just you and me now, sport.
I'm gonna find you, Goddammit!
- Mr. Dollarhyde?
- Oh, Eileen.
- Bill says there's a variation in the gamma number 3, but he caught it in time.
Good.
Good.
- Who's there?
- Mr. Dollarhyde.
- l came about the infrared emulsion.
- Come in.
It's safe.
Put your back against the door.
Stool to the right.
You're the production controller?
- What are the conditions?
- Shooting from 8 feet.
- l can't use any lights.
- What's being photographed?
- Nocturnal animals.
- When do you need it?
- ln four days.
- OK. I'll stick this in a black bag.
- 1000 C infrared, sensitive has to be handled in total darkness.
Remember to be careful.
It's easier than the 1200 series.
- Fine. - ln case you're wondering, I keep the samples by touch.
I was wondering ... I gotta fly.
Perhaps Mr. Dollarhyde can drive you home.
No, that's OK.
No thanks.
Go on.
- l'll take you.
- No thanks.
- l'll order 1200ft of 1000 C tomorrow.
- Ride with me!
- No thanks!
I'll take the bus.
Ride with me!
I would like you to.
OK, sure.
I'll just get my stuff on.
How did you come to Gateway?
They had to hire the handicapped to get this Defense contract.
- You worked out well.
Everybody they hired did.
You speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants.
I trained in therapy for speech and hearing-impaired children.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
If you don't wanna talk, that's OK.
You're very direct, I like that.
I like what you have to say.
May I touch your face?
Are you smiling or frowning?
I guess I wanna know whether I should be quiet or not.
Take my word for it,
- l'm smiling.
- l didn't mean to offend you.
- Can I take you somewhere?
- Where?
It will be my surprise.
OK.
Sure.
- Are you apprehensive?
- No.
- The protective Mr. Dollarhyde is watching us. - l want to!
In about two hours we're going to cap his tooth.
It's warm.
There ...
Hear it?
You ... rearrange the dead families into an audience.
You think what you do makes you into something different.
You're becoming ...
What is it you're becoming?
The answer is in the way you use the mirrors.
What do the mirrors make you dream?
A little to your left.
Francis, that was a great dinner.
There's a gin and tonic, right in front of you.
What are you watching?
A little homework.
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, D.
Your heart's loud if you love me.
is that you, D.?
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- lf you show me, I'll make us some coffee
- No!
- Don't go back inside the house.
- l left my purse inside.
I'll get it, it's OK.
I mean, you should stay outside.
You look so good in the sun.
When ...
Reba, when can I see you again?
We could meet at my house.
You got the message Lecktor called?
Yeah.
L'll call him in a few minutes.
We identified the tire tracks when Lounds was delivered to the "Tattler".
G-7816, Goodyear truck tires.
Our boy drives a van.
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you back?
When I'm done, Jack.
Will Graham of the fbi.
I'd like to talk to Dr. Lecktor.
Hello?
Hello, Will.
Congratulations on the job you did on Mr. Lounds.
I admired it.
What a cunning boy you are.
I'm sick of you, Lecktor.
You've got something to say, say it!
I want to help you.
Relax with yourself!
We don't invent our natures, they're issued to us with our lungs and pancreas and everything else.
Why fight it?
Fight what?
Did you really feel depressed after you shot Hobbes to death?
I think you probably did.
But it wasn't the act that got to you.
Didn't you feel so bad, because killing him felt so good.
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.
God's terrific.
He dropped a church roof on 34 worshippers last Wednesday, while groveling through a hymn.
Don't you think that felt good?
Why does it feel good, Dr. Lecktor?
It feels good, because God has power.
If one does what God does, enough times, one will become as God is.
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.
He got 140 Phillipinos in one plane crash last year.
Remember that earthquake in Italy last spring?
I enter.
The glass cutter.
The piece of glass is mine.
The house is mine.
I walk up these stairs, I pass the children's toys.
The children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.
I moved to the door.
I step into the room.
I see you there.
I see me desired by you.
Accepted and loved.
In the silver mirrors of your eyes.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
OK.
Wait a minute.
- What was it?
- Pollen.
- Oh, Thanks for the ride.
- See you tomorrow.
Mr. Dollarhyde.
What are you doing here?
- Who is it?
- lt's me.
- Hallo?
Who is it?
- lt's me.
- Francis?
- No.
Not Francis.
Francis is gone.
Francis is gone, forever.
So what do we do?
The dream.
He dreams about being desired.
So he changes people into beings who want and desire him.
- Changes?
- lt's a word.
Killing and arranging the people to imitate it.
Lecktor told me something.
If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
You put it together, our boy imitates being wanted and desired enough times, he believes he'll become one who is wanted and desired.
It'll all come true.
What about the mirrors?
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.
But he doesn't take anything.
He needs souvenirs from the houses, so he can relive the event.
Maybe he records it somehow.
So he can see himself accepted over and over and over again.
- VTR's, Polaroids, stills, what?
- How do I know?
How does he find them?
If we find out how he found them, we'll find him.
There is no connection between the two familes,
- we've done a dozen computer work.
- Jack!
All the women have a bloom on them.
He picked these women!
There's selection and design here.
- Look, admit we struck out this month.
The Lear Jet is standing by the basic lab stuff is on it.
You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, the photographer.
Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and 15 minutes!
We get the call, we roll!
- This thing'll be fresh!
- lt's not over yet.
For Christ sake it's a foregone conclusion.
It's 11.30pm. The full moon is happening tonight.
Give it up!
It's too damn late!
- l gave it up.
Till you showed up with pictures of two dead families!
Fuckin' right!
I did it, I'd do it again!
Great, but don't talk to me about late, pal!
I'll tell you when it's too fucking late!
until then we go as late as I wanna take it.
A padlock.
That's why the bolt cutter.
What's that?
He used a boltcutter to trim away branch when he was watching from the woods.
Why didn't he use the bolt cutter on the garage door?
Because a deadbolt was there when they were killed.
Donald Jacobis birthday party was April 14th.
Sometime between April and August they changed the lock, but he thought there was a padlock.
From the street you can't see the glass on the Leeds' kitchen door.
There's a big, high fence there, but he was ready with his glass cutter.
Either he was casing far ahead, and we didn't check back far enough, or ...
We checked.
Metcalf, it's Graham.
Ls the Leeds and Jacobi stuff still there?
Have the guard down there call me.
Do it!
You know that's the Jacobi's cat.
He brought a bolt cutter, because he thought there was a padlock.
Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar, but you know it's their dog.
You see the woman?
The bloom on the woman?
You can see her again and again, anytime you want.
Doggie doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog ... and the Jacobi cat ... and the padlock on the door.
You know you need a bolt cutter and every other goddamn thing.
Because everything with you is seeing isn't?
Your primary sensory intake that makies your dream live is seeing.
The reflections... mirrors ... images ...
You've seen these films!
Haven't you, my man?
The guard in the storeroom.
- The cans!
- What cans?
- The tapes were transferred from home,
Where's the packaging of the films came?
There are films of the families in document storage, find them.
You got 'em?
Are there any labels?
Leeds can, Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
The Jacobi label says the same thing:
Gateway Lab, St. Louis.
Who processed the Jacobi film?
No, Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.
Stores send 'em out.
Have him peel the top label back.
is there a label underneath?
It does, doesn't it?
I want a chopper in three minutes to Meigs Field.
At Meigs Field I want the Lear Jet prepped for St. Louis.
Where are you?
Are you here?
You're scaring me!
Stop it!
Francis, why are you doing this to me?
It's ugly.
Are you in this room?
Where are you?
You answer me!
We're looking for a man.
We know he works at Gateway.
We don't have his name, but we know he drives a van.
I got special stickers for vans.
I got 28 van permits here.

Buckle up.
We're landing in Lambert Field.
Fogel has four more names.
Two have dark hair.
Third's a woman.
Fourth is a handicapped permit.
This is our man.
Rural Route 3, Chester, Missouri.
Where is that?
We're 10.25 at the Hock Road offramp, Highway 904.
Let's go!
- Meeting point's up ahead.
- Go on to the house.
- Lieutenant Fisk said ...
- Go on to the house!
Will?
Will, you won't need that.
The Swat Team will take him down, not us.
Will?
This ought to be it.
- Kill your lights!
Alright?
- l'm OK.
Griffin's hurt bad.
I'll wait for the back-up.
Set up a road block on Route 3!
We're in the trees west of the house.
How far away's the back-up?
I'm goin' around the back, stay here.
He's in there, Jack.
And he's got somebody in there with him.
What?
Will, what did you say?
Wait for the back-up!
He's got somebody in the house with him, Jack.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Who are you?
Graham.
I'm Will Graham.
Looks worse, than it is.
See the turtles?
It was on the news.
I thought I'd work things out ... and call you after.
I thought I wouldn't wait.
How many of them made it?
Most of 'em.
We should have talked to the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk here.
I'm not falling over to talk about it much anywhere, Jack.
How much do you know?
- Not much.
The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago, and Atlanta was all over TV.
Did you think about giving me a call?
- No.
- Why not?
I quit, remember?
You look alright now.
I am alright.
If you can't look anymore, I understand.
Don't play games with me!
If I really didn't need you, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks till full moon.
We have a better chance if you help me.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
Think it'll keep them out, Dad?
- Yep.
How many turtle's eggs are in here?
- ln this hatchery?
40 or 50 of 'em.
Crabs get most of them, huh?
- Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it.
What about the dogs?
No.
That's why we buried the wire down in the sand.
I need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be his friend.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, Molly, I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.
We've got it pretty good.
- More than good.
All that happened before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only look at the evidence.
I wouldn't get involved.
He'd never even see me.
If they find him, they'll have to take him down.
What do you think?
You've already decided and you're not really asking.
If I were asking?
Stay here with me.
Me and Kevin.
That's selfish and I know it.
I'll come inside with you and show you around.
Mr. Crawford said maybe you want to be alone.
- That's right.
There's a VCR in your hotel room.
There's home movies of both families on half inch VHS.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen door.
Used a glass cutter on a suction cup.
Entry was skilful.
All prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair, strong.
Size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood AB positive, from saliva on glass from the suction cup.
Why did he leave saliva on the glass?
It was hot that night, so it must have felt cool in the house.
Intruder cut Charles Leeds's throat then shot Mrs. Leeds.
Bullet lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation.
Moderate elevation of serotonin and an increase in histamine indicate she lived for 5 minutes after the shot.
All other injuries are post-mortem.
Direction of the blood stains on the wall indicate arterial spray.
Leeds tried to fight because intruder moved towards the children's room.
Blood stains on west wall in master bedroom and sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained,
as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leeds' chest.
Also believed post-mortem.
What did the killer do with them after they were dead?
Hi.
This is Valerie Leeds.
I can't speak right now, but if you leave a message after the beep, I'll get right back.
290th floor.
Going up.
When they were dead, he smashed the mirrors and selected pieces for use on Mrs. Leeds.
Killing Mr. Leeds and the children would take less than a minute.
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem 4 or 5 minutes later.
What did he do in the interval?
He smeared blood stains on the wall.
Hello?
- Molly?
Will, is that you?
- Yeah, honey.
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
I love you.
- l love you too, baby.
What are you dreaming?
That's something you can't afford for me to know about.
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
lr was maddening to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg, but there wasn't any in the bathroom.
It came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you?
You touched her with your bare hands and then you put your gloves back on!
But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so they could see you?
Hallo?
- Jack, this is Graham.
is Price still in Latent Prints?
- Yeah, the Single Print Index.
What have you got?
- Get him to Atlanta.
Atlanta P. D. dusted everything and they're good.
- Not as good as Price.
I'll send him tomorrow.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails and the corneas of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves.
The subject's teeth look like this.
These were reconstructed from the bite mark impressions we took from Mrs. Leeds and the Jacobi woman.
He has pegged lateral incisors, that's these teeth here and here.
Vice and narcotics, you take the K-Y cowboys and the leather bars.
Marcus, Whitman heads up at the funeral.
The rest, see the sheet.
One more thing.
I've heard officers call this killer the 'Tooth Fairy'.
Well, I don't wanna hear that in public or see it in memoranda!
That's it.
I know a burglar's gonna fence what he stole for cash money.
I know his motive, so I go to work on fences.
This guy, we don't have a motive.
None of us have shit and we know it.
It's in his dreams.
His motive?
- Yeah.
His act fuels his fantasy.
Which is?
- l don't know.
Commissioner says you're the one who got Garrett Jacob Hobbes and then Dr. Lecktor 3 years ago?
- Lecktor killed 90 people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
I heard he cut you pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's.
It has puncture wound.
The Jacobis had a cat.
That's right.
We found the litter box, but not the cat.
Give Birmingham P. D. a methane probe out of Washington.
Have them cover the backyard.
Maybe the cat's buried there.
Yeah?
- This is Jimmie Price, fbi.
Let me put you on the speaker.
- Who am I talking to?
Jack Crawford and Will Graham.
I got a partial print, probably a thumb.
And a fragment of a palm off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.
Thumb print came off the oldest kid's left eye.
Can we make an identification off it?
- Maybe if he's in my index.
Wanna work on these in the dark room.
I'll fax the prints this afternoon.
- Thanks.
If we get lucky with that print ... lf Jimmie can find him in the index.
- Hey, Graham!
Whatta you say?
It's me, Lounds, from the "Tattler".
I did the Lecktor paperback.
When did they call you in?
I'm buying lunch, alright?
- Give it a rest!
I'm doing my job.
How does he compare to Lecktor?
What does he do to them?
How does he do 'em, Will?
Keep the fuck away from me!
- Will, Will!
Son-of-a-bitch snuck into the hospital while I was sedated and took pictures.
I know.
- Don't expect too much from me.
We only got three weeks left.
- You think I'm just gonna see him?
That's Houdini!
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on till we get smart or lucky.
He won't stop.
Why?
He's got a taste for it.
- You do know something about him.
Not enough.
I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mind set.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court 3 years ago.
I keep getting it for Christmas.
Did you get my card?
- l got it, thank you.
How is Officer Stuart?
Fine.
- Emotional problems, I hear.
Do you have any problems, Will?
- No.
No, of course you don't.
I'm glad you came.
My callers are usually psychologists from cornfield universities.
Second-raters, the lot.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction.
- And?
Very interesting, even to a layman.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
- l thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
- Yes?
- You read about it?
In the papers.
I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing them.
Any ideas?
- Why should I tell you?
You get to see the file.
There's another reason.
- Pray tell.
You might be curious to see if you're smarter.
Smarter than you, since you caught me?
I know I'm not smart.
- Then how did you catch me?
Your disadvantages.
- What disadvantages?
You're insane.
You're very tanned, Will.
Your hands are rough.
Not cop's hands any more.
And that shaving lotion is from a child?
With a ship on the bottle?
Don't think appeals to my intellectual vanity will work.
I don't think that.
You'll do it or you won't.
Dr. Bloom's working on it.
He's the best.
Have you got the file?
- Yes.
- Pictures?
- Yes.
Let me have them and I'll consider it.
- No.
Dream much, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file and I'll tell you what I think.
This is a very shy boy.
What were the yards like?
- Big, fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, if he imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he'll go look outside.
Ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy.
Interesting.
No.
You thought of it before.
- l considered it.
You wanted to look at me.
To get the scent back.
- l want your opinion.
I don't have one now.
- When you do, I want to hear it.
Can I keep this?
- Haven't decided.- l'll study them.
Also any other files.
You can call me.
For calls to my lawyer I get a phone.
Will you leave me your home number?
No.
Do you know how you caught me?
There's a number on the file.
- Do you know how you caught me?
You caught me, Will, because we're just alike.
You want the scent, smell yourself!
Gotcha!
Get up and face the wall.
Don't turn around, or I'll mace you in the face.
Thank you so much.
I'll call when I'm finished.
You ready for your call?
- Yes, thank you.
Paltrow, Christiansen and Golub, Law Offices.
I'm sorry, I misdialed.
Thank you for using ATT.
This is Operator 24.
Operator, I don't have the use of my arms.
Would you dial a number for me?
- Certainly.
What's the number?
Area code 3-0-1.
5-5-5-6-6-2-4.
University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry.
- Dr. Bloom, please.
I'll connect you with his office.
What's his secretary's name?
- Martha King.
Just a moment.
Martha King's desk.
- Hi, Martha.
Martha doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob Greer.
Dr. Bloom asked me to send a paper to someone, but I never got the address or number.
- She'll be in in the morning.
I've got to catch the Federal express.
Could you pull it out of her Rolodex?
I don't see a Rolodex.
- l bet she has a call caddy.
Yeah.
- Well point right on down to G.
Alright.
- The last name is Graham.
The man the book is for.
Mr. Will Graham.
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation, 10th and Pennsylvania, Washington D. C.
I bet his home address is there too.
3680 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida.
Thank you very much.
Finished!
Mommy!
- Oh my gosh!
It's alright.
Stewardess?
There's a couple down from Duluth, we were talking about mortgages.
And ... I figure, you're gonna unload this turkey.
Well, then the squad car rolls up, they start asking questions,
The the good old boys giving them the whole Grand Tour:
Who was lying where and what.
Terrific.
So they get in their sedan and get the hell out of here.
Any single men ask to see the house?
No-one asked me.
You cut the branch so you could see.
Then you passed the time whittling and dreaming.
When night came, you saw them behind bright windows.
You watched the shades go down, saw the lights go out one by one.
Then you went in to 'em, didn'tcha?
Didn't you, son-of-a-bitch?
You watched them all day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
I need the Firearms and Toolmarks Section on the severed branch.
I need Bowman to fall on this carving.
- ls it weird?
The mark?
Yeah.
If Documents can't do it, Langley can.
- Did Price get an identification?
No, not yet.
It's a hand search.
Have you seen the "Tattler"?
It's not on my reading list.
- Yeah, well, you're all over the front page.
Who the hell was it, Lounds?
- Who else?
Goddammit, Jack!
I promised Molly.
Come in!
- Dr. Chilton?
- Yes?
On cleaning out Dr. Lecktor's cell, he hid something in a book.
We dug around.
- ls that it?
Put it down.
Has anyone seen this except you?
- No.
Crawford's office.
- This is Chilton.
Mr. Graham please!
He's not here.
Mr. Crawford is on the line with him now.
Will you tell him this is very, very urgent.
I'll hold on.
Dr. Chilton, it's Crawford.
Graham is on the line, too.
I have two pieces of a note that appears to be from the murderer in Atlanta.
Where did you get it?
- Hidden in a book in Lecktor's cell.
Don't touch the note.
Read it to us!
- lt's on toilet tissue.
"Dear Dr. Lecktor, I am delighted that you've taken an interest in me.
You alone can understand what I am becoming.
You know the people I used to help me are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.
Just as the source of light is burning.
My collection of your press clippings is as absurd as are mine.
The "Tooth Fairy".
What could be more inappropriate?
Investigator Graham interests me.
Very purposeful-looking.
I hope we can correspond."
There's a piece missing.
I'll read the bottom part.
"After I hear from you, I might send you something wet."
Signed: "Avid fan." There are teeth marks at the bottom.
Order a chopper.
Don't care whose.
2.
Call Alabama Air National Guard, get Graham back here right now.
Call Documents and scramble a team.
I want everybody moving'.
The Documents team is underway to pick up the note.
Listen, I wanna replace the note.
I don't want Lecktor to know.
He might try to warn the killer.
Where's Lecktor?
- Holding cell.
How long can you keep him in there?
- Three, four hours.
We have a note coming in, possibly from the Tooth Fairy.
No. 1 Priority.
Has to go to Hair and Fiber.
One hair.
Maybe half an inch.
Couple of blue grains.
- Work the hair.
What do you have as a negative comparison?
- Lecktor's comb.
Whiskers from a razor, hair from the Security Guard.
How many handled this without gloves?
Guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
- The cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had the oil washed off his fingers.
But the others ...one smudge.
No ridges, it's just the texture of the paper.
I can fume it but I can't say the iodine stains will fade.
- Ninhydrin?
Boosted with heat?
- No.
You couldn't wash it out.
I can't get a print in the time.
How long?
- 20 minutes max.
Main thing is, how was Lecktor supposed to reply?
It's probably in the missing section.
'l hope we can correspond'.
Then comes the gap.
This note was written in ballpoint.
But it looks like Lecktor went over this area with a felt-tip pen and tore it away.
You're so sly, but so am I.
The aniline dyes in the felt-tip pens, like Lecktor used, are transparent to infrared.
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.
This looks like the tip of a T.
This one could be the top of an R.
- Three T's and an R in "Tattler".
The article about me and Lecktor.
No-one else carried that.
Personal ads.
The Tooth Fairy told Lecktor to reply through the Personal ads in the "Tattler".
Chicago is running through them right now.
Here is a line of communication between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor.
If we find Lecktor's answer, we'll replace it with our own.
This is what he'll read:
"Dear Avid Fan:
lnherit my mantle and surpass my achievements.
Mementos for you at Baltimore Central.
Left luggage.
Ticket 7-2-6-8-3."
It's a letter drop.
We stake it out and grab him.
Anything from Chicago?
- Not yet.
- When do they go to press?
In 35 minutes.
- Christ!
- Let's get to the physical.
There was no print.
- The core size of the hair matches the blond hair found in the Jacobi's.
Your man wrote the note.
Three blue grains went to Brians's end.
Commercial granulated cleanser from the cleaning man.
Particles of dried blood, but not enough to type.
This is Chester, who's there?
- Will Graham, Jack Crawford.
Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in it.
- Read it!
"Dear Avid Fan, you honor me.
You're very beautiful.
One hundred prayers for your safety.
Find help in Galatians 6, 11 and 15,2.
Acts 3,3;
Revelations 18,7.
Jonah 6,8;
John 6,22;
Luke 1,7.
Thanks.
Jimmie,
Get anywhere with the Leeds print?
- Not yet.
Cryptography at Langley?
- They're working on the telex now.
No.
Our ad has to go out in the same book code, or he'll know.
Book code?
"100 prayers" could be a page number and the paired numbers lines.
Galatians only has six chapters.
Same with Jonah, it only has four.
Lecktor was not using the Bible.
The Tooth Fairy probably named the book in the part torn out.
What about sweating' Lecktor?
We tried sodium amytal 3 years ago, and he gave 'em a recipe for a chip dip.
- Wonderful.
The Tooth Fairy knows which book.
He'd know from articles about Lecktor.
Willingham took Polaroids of Lecktor's cell.
Have him meet me.
- Where?
- Library of Congress.
25 minutes.
He won't make it.
Lecktor's ad runs as is, or we pull it and run our own ad next week.
- We got 17 days left till full moon!
I don't like Lecktor's ad running without knowing what it says.
It's your call, Will.
Run it.
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something else?
Then we'll all feel sick.
And if Bowman can't figure it out?
Then we'll bait him with something else in the "Tattler".
- What?
Me.
That's not a very good idea.
Why not?
Won't it provoke him?
- Maybe.
I was thinking about you.
You're getting in deeper and deeper.
Sidney?
The last time you pushed yourself all outta shape.
Try it on again, or if you go through some trauma, you could relapse.
Sidney, don't worry about me.
I'm workin' the evidence, makin' moves, that's all.
I'm fine.
Bowman says it is not books in Lecktor's cell.
Price?
- lt's a bust out.
The Leeds' print will get us a conviction.
He must never have been printed, because he is not in our index.
We are not gonna identify him off the print.
I'll use Lounds.
What for?
Our boy doesn't read the Times.
He reads Lounds in the "Tattler".
What else should we cover?
- He put the shorts on Leeds after he was dead, so we wouldn't think he was gay.
He molested all his male victims and may be impotent with women.
Our forensic psychologists have projected that he may have had sexual relations with his mother.
How long will you stay in Washington?
- Till we've got the Tooth Fairy.
Will the "Tattler" get the stuff?
How's your sex life been affected?
Mine?
It doesn't.
It affects yours!
Fuck yourself!
Look, pal, you're news!
- You shot the pictures.
Alright.
I'm in the shots with Graham.
- What?
- Yeah.
Come on!
You want this to look real?
Make sure the theater sign is just out of focus.
We want him to read it.
- And make sure I look excellent!
Shoot it!
One more.
One more.
- That's enough.
OK, Graham.
Always nice, huh?
Let's have lunch, call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.
Dr. Bloom.
I need them on my desk in 2 hours.
- OK.
Did Bowman break the code yet?
- No.
They say the cutting tool was a common bolt cutter.
I got a call from Asian Studies in Langley.
The mark on the tree is a Chinese lucky sign in gambling.
The same character appears in Mah-jongg.
It means Red Dragon.
Mean anything to you?
No.
If he shows and he's smart, he'll approach from the front, pass, turn and try and take you from behind.
How's your hearing?
- Good.
You'll wear a wire, one way.
We'll hear you, but you won't hear us.
Checked out a 44 Special Bulldog?
Load these in it.
You ever fire 'em?
- Glaser safety slugs?
Opens up on impact.
Guaranteed one shot stop.
You got body armor?
- Kevlar Second Chance.
Hope you get one.
- 'Cause he goes for the head shot?
Let's walk the route.
United Flight 8490 to Newark now boarding at gate 7.
United Flight 8490 to Newark now boarding at gate 7.
Can you get to a phone?
So where are things?
Got nine days left.
We're working on it.
You don't wanna talk about what you're doing, do you?
Hotel rooms ...
An illicit romance ...
We have to stop meeting like this.
Remember the first time we met?
Yeah.
We were alone together in that room.
Though I'd never seen you before, we were sitting there, speaking.
A shadow flickered across your face.
I said, "What's that?"
Remember what you said?
I said:
"This is too good to believe."
Time is luck, Will.
You know the value of every day.
Someone's coming.
Go!
Don't!
Don't move!
Take the money!
Don't shoot!
Clear!
Quicker, man!
I'm being mugged!
Do you know who I am?
- l don't wanna know who you are.
You said I'm a sexual pervert.
'An animal' you said.
Do you know who I am now?
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Open your eyes!
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.
That's why you're here.
Open your eyes or I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Well, here I ... am.
Look at the screen.
William Blake's
'The Great Red Dragon' and 'The Woman Clothed in the Rays of the Sun'.
Do you see?
- Yes.
Mrs. Leeds.
Do you see?
- Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi.
Do you see?
- Yes.
The next family as they will look.
Do you see?
- Yes.
Mrs. Leeds, later.
Her husband beside her.
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.
The Dragon rampant.
Freddie Lounds.
Your photograph.
No!
- No what?
- Not me, please!
Please!
- Are you a man?
- Yes.
Do you imply that I'm queer?
- God, no!
Before me you are a slug in the sun.
You are privy to a great becoming and you recognise nothing!
You are an ant in the afterbirth!
It is your nature to do one thing correctly... tremble.
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, Lounds, you and the others you owe me awe!
We've one more piece of work to do.
If he takes off the mask, I'm dead now!
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!
Read this into the tape recorder.
Go.
"l have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the Red Dragon.
All I wrote about him were lies.
Will Graham made me write them to pull him into a trap.
Will Graham, you will learn how much you have to dread, because I lied.
He will be more merciful to me.
You will lie awake in fear of what the Red Dragon will do.
I will testify to the truth of this."
You did very well.
Will you let me go now?
Please?
- You will tell the truth?
- l promise.
Good.
We'll seal your promise with ...
We'll seal your promise
with a kiss.
Only five answers are possible.
Any member of a team may buzz in and answer.
Bowman, skip the cryptography and tell me what it says!
- Did he try to say anything at all?
- No.
- He never regained consciousness.
Did you hear the tape?
- Yes.
Listen,
Bowman just broke Lecktor's code in the personal ad.
- lt's the State of Maryland Statutes.
You need to know, now.
- What?
Listen to me.
Everything's okay.
I've taken care of it.
What is it, Jack?
The bastard gave him your address.
It said: "Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida."
Save yourself.
Kill them all.
- Get me a plane!
- Will!
Will!
Mom?
Huh?
What?
Someone's outside.
- l hear noises.
- Where?
- Outside.
Go back to your room and close the door.
- Mom?
- Do it, now!
- Mom, are you alright?
- What?
What is it?
What is it?
What's going on?
Come back inside!
- What's going on?
- Come inside!
- So what ...?
- Come back inside!
I'm sorry, Molly.
I'm sorry about all of this.
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.
- He's after you now, isn't he?
- lt's just a precaution.
Kevin?
Run down to the water and check the out dock.
I wanna hang around here.
I'm in the kitchen, mom.
What's that about?
He's afraid to leave you alone with me now?
He saw the article in the "Tattler".
I wanted to talk to him, but he said he'd bring it up with you.
Good for him.
Kevin, help me unpack and then we'll get some groceries.
You and mom are well protected.
No one's gonna find you.
is there anything I need to know, to see about mom?
No.
- This guy's planning to kill us?
- We don't know that.
When you gonna kill him?
I'm not.
It's only my job to find him.
In the newspaper it said you were in a special hospital.
Well, it was a regular hospital, then I was transferred to the psychiatric wing.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
I don't know.
Was it because of this man Lecktor?
What happened?
Lecktor attacked college girls and he killed them.
How?
In bad ways.
He was a psychiatrist.
One of the girls was his patient and I went to talk to him about her.
I tried to build up feelings like the killer had, so I would know why he did it 'cause that would help me find him.
I was sitting in Lecktor's office and saw a book on a shelf with pictures of war wounds.
And I knew it was him.
So I went to a pay phone to call the police.
That's when he attacked me.
You and mom ... came to see me in hospital and that helped a lot.
But after my body got OK, I still had his thoughts in my head.
I stopped talking to people.
A doctor friend, Dr. Bloom asked me to get help, and I did.
And after a while I felt better and I was OK again.
And the way you thought ...
felt that bad?
Kevin, the ugliest thoughts in the world.
What kind of coffee you like?
What?
- You like that Folger's stuff, right?
- Yeah.
Mom too.
- When can we go home, Dad?
- l don't know, Kevin.
So where are things?
Nowhere.
Everything we've tried is a dead end or has backfired.
Crawford is planning the next crime scene.
- Six days till full moon.
- Can you quit?
No.
What's next?
- l go to Atlanta.
- Crawford?
No.
I have to be alone.
- You're talking about doing exactly what ...
- This killing it's gotta stop!
William, you're going to make yourself sick, or get killed.
You and Kevin should go to Montana, see your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.
I'll come and get you afterwards.
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
I'm sorry I can't come to the phone.
- l'm sorry too.
- Excuse me?
- Coffee.
Just you and me now, sport.
I'm gonna find you, Goddammit!
- Mr. Dollarhyde?
- Oh, Eileen.
- Bill says there's a variation in the gamma number 3, but he caught it in time.
Good.
Good.
- Who's there?
- Mr. Dollarhyde.
- l came about the infrared emulsion.
- Come in.
It's safe.
Put your back against the door.
Stool to the right.
You're the production controller?
- What are the conditions?
- Shooting from 8 feet.
- l can't use any lights.
- What's being photographed?
- Nocturnal animals.
- When do you need it?
- ln four days.
- OK. I'll stick this in a black bag.
- 1000 C infrared, sensitive has to be handled in total darkness.
Remember to be careful.
It's easier than the 1200 series.
- Fine. - ln case you're wondering, I keep the samples by touch.
I was wondering ... I gotta fly.
Perhaps Mr. Dollarhyde can drive you home.
No, that's OK.
No thanks.
Go on.
- l'll take you.
- No thanks.
- l'll order 1200ft of 1000 C tomorrow.
- Ride with me!
- No thanks!
I'll take the bus.
Ride with me!
I would like you to.
OK, sure.
I'll just get my stuff on.
How did you come to Gateway?
They had to hire the handicapped to get this Defense contract.
- You worked out well.
Everybody they hired did.
You speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants.
I trained in therapy for speech and hearing-impaired children.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
If you don't wanna talk, that's OK.
You're very direct, I like that.
I like what you have to say.
May I touch your face?
Are you smiling or frowning?
I guess I wanna know whether I should be quiet or not.
Take my word for it,
- l'm smiling.
- l didn't mean to offend you.
- Can I take you somewhere?
- Where?
It will be my surprise.
OK.
Sure.
- Are you apprehensive?
- No.
- The protective Mr. Dollarhyde is watching us. - l want to!
In about two hours we're going to cap his tooth.
It's warm.
There ...
Hear it?
You ... rearrange the dead families into an audience.
You think what you do makes you into something different.
You're becoming ...
What is it you're becoming?
The answer is in the way you use the mirrors.
What do the mirrors make you dream?
A little to your left.
Francis, that was a great dinner.
There's a gin and tonic, right in front of you.
What are you watching?
A little homework.
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, D.
Your heart's loud if you love me.
is that you, D.?
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- lf you show me, I'll make us some coffee
- No!
- Don't go back inside the house.
- l left my purse inside.
I'll get it, it's OK.
I mean, you should stay outside.
You look so good in the sun.
When ...
Reba, when can I see you again?
We could meet at my house.
You got the message Lecktor called?
Yeah.
L'll call him in a few minutes.
We identified the tire tracks when Lounds was delivered to the "Tattler".
G-7816, Goodyear truck tires.
Our boy drives a van.
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you back?
When I'm done, Jack.
Will Graham of the fbi.
I'd like to talk to Dr. Lecktor.
Hello?
Hello, Will.
Congratulations on the job you did on Mr. Lounds.
I admired it.
What a cunning boy you are.
I'm sick of you, Lecktor.
You've got something to say, say it!
I want to help you.
Relax with yourself!
We don't invent our natures, they're issued to us with our lungs and pancreas and everything else.
Why fight it?
Fight what?
Did you really feel depressed after you shot Hobbes to death?
I think you probably did.
But it wasn't the act that got to you.
Didn't you feel so bad, because killing him felt so good.
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.
God's terrific.
He dropped a church roof on 34 worshippers last Wednesday, while groveling through a hymn.
Don't you think that felt good?
Why does it feel good, Dr. Lecktor?
It feels good, because God has power.
If one does what God does, enough times, one will become as God is.
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.
He got 140 Phillipinos in one plane crash last year.
Remember that earthquake in Italy last spring?
I enter.
The glass cutter.
The piece of glass is mine.
The house is mine.
I walk up these stairs, I pass the children's toys.
The children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.
I moved to the door.
I step into the room.
I see you there.
I see me desired by you.
Accepted and loved.
In the silver mirrors of your eyes.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
OK.
Wait a minute.
- What was it?
- Pollen.
- Oh, Thanks for the ride.
- See you tomorrow.
Mr. Dollarhyde.
What are you doing here?
- Who is it?
- lt's me.
- Hallo?
Who is it?
- lt's me.
- Francis?
- No.
Not Francis.
Francis is gone.
Francis is gone, forever.
So what do we do?
The dream.
He dreams about being desired.
So he changes people into beings who want and desire him.
- Changes?
- lt's a word.
Killing and arranging the people to imitate it.
Lecktor told me something.
If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
You put it together, our boy imitates being wanted and desired enough times, he believes he'll become one who is wanted and desired.
It'll all come true.
What about the mirrors?
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.
But he doesn't take anything.
He needs souvenirs from the houses, so he can relive the event.
Maybe he records it somehow.
So he can see himself accepted over and over and over again.
- VTR's, Polaroids, stills, what?
- How do I know?
How does he find them?
If we find out how he found them, we'll find him.
There is no connection between the two familes,
- we've done a dozen computer work.
- Jack!
All the women have a bloom on them.
He picked these women!
There's selection and design here.
- Look, admit we struck out this month.
The Lear Jet is standing by the basic lab stuff is on it.
You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, the photographer.
Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and 15 minutes!
We get the call, we roll!
- This thing'll be fresh!
- lt's not over yet.
For Christ sake it's a foregone conclusion.
It's 11.30pm. The full moon is happening tonight.
Give it up!
It's too damn late!
- l gave it up.
Till you showed up with pictures of two dead families!
Fuckin' right!
I did it, I'd do it again!
Great, but don't talk to me about late, pal!
I'll tell you when it's too fucking late!
until then we go as late as I wanna take it.
A padlock.
That's why the bolt cutter.
What's that?
He used a boltcutter to trim away branch when he was watching from the woods.
Why didn't he use the bolt cutter on the garage door?
Because a deadbolt was there when they were killed.
Donald Jacobis birthday party was April 14th.
Sometime between April and August they changed the lock, but he thought there was a padlock.
From the street you can't see the glass on the Leeds' kitchen door.
There's a big, high fence there, but he was ready with his glass cutter.
Either he was casing far ahead, and we didn't check back far enough, or ...
We checked.
Metcalf, it's Graham.
Ls the Leeds and Jacobi stuff still there?
Have the guard down there call me.
Do it!
You know that's the Jacobi's cat.
He brought a bolt cutter, because he thought there was a padlock.
Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar, but you know it's their dog.
You see the woman?
The bloom on the woman?
You can see her again and again, anytime you want.
Doggie doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog ... and the Jacobi cat ... and the padlock on the door.
You know you need a bolt cutter and every other goddamn thing.
Because everything with you is seeing isn't?
Your primary sensory intake that makies your dream live is seeing.
The reflections... mirrors ... images ...
You've seen these films!
Haven't you, my man?
The guard in the storeroom.
- The cans!
- What cans?
- The tapes were transferred from home,
Where's the packaging of the films came?
There are films of the families in document storage, find them.
You got 'em?
Are there any labels?
Leeds can, Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
The Jacobi label says the same thing:
Gateway Lab, St. Louis.
Who processed the Jacobi film?
No, Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.
Stores send 'em out.
Have him peel the top label back.
is there a label underneath?
It does, doesn't it?
I want a chopper in three minutes to Meigs Field.
At Meigs Field I want the Lear Jet prepped for St. Louis.
Where are you?
Are you here?
You're scaring me!
Stop it!
Francis, why are you doing this to me?
It's ugly.
Are you in this room?
Where are you?
You answer me!
We're looking for a man.
We know he works at Gateway.
We don't have his name, but we know he drives a van.
I got special stickers for vans.
I got 28 van permits here.
- Start feeding me names.
is this Lieutenant Fisk?
Will Graham.
I need you to get the driver's licenses of these names.
The man we're looking for is blond, Caucasian, 20-40 years old, over six feet tall, 180-225 pounds.
First name?
A-L-V-A-R-O.
First name Joseph.
A-L-V-A-R-O, first name Joseph.
No.
Black hair.
No.
- Next.
Dillon, D-l-L-L-O-N.
First name Lincoln.
- Dillon.
D-l-L-L-O-N, first name Lincoln.
No.
Next.
Male, Caucasian, 6ft 7 inches, 217 pounds, eyes brown, hair blond.
34 years old.
- Put it through the data fax.
Fast!
Buckle up.
We're landing in Lambert Field.
Fogel has four more names.
Two have dark hair.
Third's a woman.
Fourth is a handicapped permit.
This is our man.
Rural Route 3, Chester, Missouri.
Where is that?
We're 10.25 at the Hock Road offramp, Highway 904.
Let's go!
- Meeting point's up ahead.
- Go on to the house.
- Lieutenant Fisk said ...
- Go on to the house!
Will?
Will, you won't need that.
The Swat Team will take him down, not us.
Will?
This ought to be it.
- Kill your lights!
Alright?
- l'm OK.
Griffin's hurt bad.
I'll wait for the back-up.
Set up a road block on Route 3!
We're in the trees west of the house.
How far away's the back-up?
I'm goin' around the back, stay here.
He's in there, Jack.
And he's got somebody in there with him.
What?
Will, what did you say?
Wait for the back-up!
He's got somebody in the house with him, Jack.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Who are you?
Graham.
I'm Will Graham.
Looks worse, than it is.
See the turtles?
It was on the news.
I thought I'd work things out ... and call you after.
I thought I wouldn't wait.
How many of them made it?
Most of 'em.
We should've talked at the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk about it here.
I'm not falling all over myself to talk about it much of anywhere, Jack.
How much do you know?
Not much.
The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago.
The second one in Atlanta was all over TV.
Did you ever think about giving me a call?
No.
Why not?
I quit.
Remember?
You look all right now.
I am all right.
If you can't look anymore, I understand.
Don't try to run a game down on me, Jack.
If I really didn't need you to come back, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks and a few days until the next full moon.
We have a better chance to get him fast if you help.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
Hi, Molly.
Think it'll keep them out, Dad?
Yep.
How many turtle eggs do you think are in here?
In this hatchery?
I'll bet there's 40 or 50 of them.
Crabs get most of the newborns, huh?
Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it, guaranteed.
What about the dogs?
Are they gonna get in here?
They can't dig under.
That's why we bury the wire down in the sand.
We need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be his friend, Jack.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, Molly,
I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.
We got it pretty good, don't we?
We have it more than good.
All that happened to you before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only look at evidence.
I wouldn't get deeply involved.
He'd never even see me or know my name.
If they find him, they'll have to take him down, not me.
What do you think?
I think you've already decided and you're not really asking.
If I were asking?
Stay here with me, me and Kevin.
But it's selfish, and I know it.
Come here.
- I'll come inside with you, if you want, to show you around.
Mr. Crawford said maybe you'd want to be alone, but...
That's right.
There's a VCR hooked up in your hotel room.
They transferred some home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen sliding door.
Used a glass cutter anchored to a suction cup.
His entry was skillful.
All the prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair, strong, size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood AB positive, typed from saliva on glass from licking the suction cup.
Why didn't he care that he left saliva on the glass?
It was hot out that night, so inside the house must have felt cool to him.
Intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he was rising, then shot Mrs. Leeds.
Bullet entered right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation.
Moderate elevation of serotonin and marked increase of free histamine level in gunshot wound indicates she lived at least five minutes after she was shot.
All her other injuries were post-mortem.
Direction and velocity of bloodstains on east wall indicate arterial spray.
Even with his throat cut, Leeds tried to fight because the intruder was moving to the children's room.
Bloodstains on west wall of master bedroom and matted sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained,
as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leed's chest, also believed to be post-mortem.
What did the killer do with them after they were dead?
- Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry, I can't come to the phone right now, but if you'd like to leave a message please do so after the beep, and I'll call you back as soon as I can.
- Twenty-ninth floor.
Going up.
When they were dead, he smashed the mirrors and began selecting pieces that he would use later on Mrs. Leeds.
Killing Mr. Leeds and the children would take less than a minute.
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem, four or five minutes later.
What did he do in the interval? The smeared bloodstains on the west wall... Hello?
- Molly?
- Will, is that you?
Yeah, it's me, honey.
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
I love you.
I love you too, baby.
What are you dreaming?
That's something you can't afford for me to know about, isn't it?
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
It was maddening to have to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg, but there wasn't any talcum powder in the bathroom.
The talcum powder came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You touched her with your bare hands, and then you put your gloves back on.
But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so that they could see you?
- Hello?
Jack, this is Graham.
Is Price still in Latent Prints?
Yeah, he's in charge of the Single Print Index now.
What do you got, Will?
Get him to Atlanta.
Atlanta PD swears they dusted everything, and their guy is pretty good.
He is good.
He's not as good as Price.
I'll get him on a plane in the morning.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails and the corneas of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves.
Our people swear he wore surgeon's gloves the whole time.
They dusted everything.
Your report didn't mention eyes.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
- Because Mrs. Leeds was a beautiful woman.
This is what the subject's teeth looked like.
The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed these from the impressions that we took of the bite marks on the Leeds woman here and the Jacobi woman in Birmingham last month.
As you can see, he has pegged lateral incisors, that's these teeth here and here.
- Vice and Narcotics, you take the K-Y cowboys and leather bars.
Marcus, Whitman, heads up at the funeral.
The rest of your assignments are on the sheet.
Let's go.
One more thing.
I've heard officers referring to this killer as the Tooth Fairy.
Well, I don't want to hear that in public, and I don't want to see it in internal memoranda.
That's it.
I know a burglar's gonna fence what he stole 'cause his motive is cash money.
I know his motive, so I go to work on fences.
This guy, we don't even have motive.
None of us have shit, and we know it.
- It's in his dreams.
His motive?
- Yeah.
His act fuels his fantasy.
Which is?
I don't know.
The commissioner was saying that you're the one who got Garrett Jacob Hobbs, and then Dr. Lecktor three years ago.
Lecktor killed nine people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
One's on a respirator at a hospital in Baltimore, the other's in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor? The psychologists call him a psychopath.
They don't know what else to call him.
I understand he cut you pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's.
The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen.
The Jacobis in Birmingham had a cat, didn't they?
That's right.
We found a litter box downstairs, but we didn't find a cat.
Why don't you get Birmingham PD a methane probe out of Washington, have them cover the back yard.
Maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
- Yeah?
- This is Jimmy Price, FBI.
Let me put you on speakerphone.
Who am I talking to?
Jimmy, it's Jack Crawford.
You got Will Graham here, too.
I got a partial print with a tented arch, it's probably a thumb.
And the fragment of a palm off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.
Thumbprint came off the oldest kid's left eye.
It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.
Can we make an identification off of it?
Maybe, if he's ever been printed and he's in my index.
I want to work these up in my own darkroom.
I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon.
Thanks, Jimmy.
No comment.
- If we get lucky with that print, we're in, if Jimmy can find him in the index and if he's ever been printed.
If not, I don't know.
Hey, Will Graham!
What do you say?
You remember me?
Freddie Lounds, covered the Lecktor case for the Tattler, did the paperback.
So, Will, when did they call you in?
What do you got?
Hey, look, I'm buying lunch.
Lounds, why don't you give it a rest?
Hey, he's news.
I'm doing my job.
So, how does this guy compare with Lecktor?
How does he do them?
How's he do them, Will? Keep the fuck away from me.
- Will, Will.
Son of a bitch snuck into the hospital while I was sedated after Lecktor.
He pulled back the sheets, and he took pictures.
Yeah, I know.
Look, don't expect too much from me, all right?
We only got three weeks left, and you're our best shot.
You think I'm gonna see him standing in the street and say, "There he is"?
That's Houdini you're thinking about.
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on until we get smart or get lucky.
He won't stop.
Why?
He's got a genuine taste for it.
You do know something about him.
Not enough.
I think I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mindset.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Yeah, I keep getting it for Christmas.
Did you get my card?
I got it.
Thank you.
How is Officer Stewart?
The one who was first to see my basement.
Stewart's fine.
Emotional problems, I hear.
Do you have any problems, Will?
No.
No, of course you don't.
I'm glad you came.
My callers are mostly clinical psychologists from cornfield universities somewhere.
Second-raters, the lot.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
And?
Very interesting.
Even to a layman.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Yes, I thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Yes?
You read about it?
In the papers.
I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
I thought you might have some ideas.
Why should I tell you?
You'd get to see the file on this case.
And there's another reason.
Pray tell.
Thought you might be curious to see if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
Then by implication you think you're smarter than me, since you caught me.
No.
I know that I'm not smarter than you.
Then how did you catch me?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantages?
You're insane.
You are very tan, Will.
Your hands are rough.
They don't look like cop's hands anymore.
And that shaving lotion is something a child would select.
It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it?
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
I don't think I'll persuade you at all.
You'll either do it or you won't.
Besides, we have Dr. Bloom working on it, and he's the best.
Do you have the file with you?
Yes.
Pictures?
Yes.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
No.
Dream much, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file, and I'll tell you what I think.
This is a very shy boy, Will.
What were their yards like?
Big back yards.
Fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, my dear Will, if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he might go outside to look at it.
Have you ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy for this sort of thing.
That's interesting.
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.
I considered it.
You came here to look at me, to get the old scent back again, didn't you?
I want your opinion.
I don't have one right now.
Well, when you have one, I'd like to hear it.
Can I keep this?
I haven't decided yet.
I'll study them.
When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too.
You can call me.
When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone.
Would you like to leave me your home phone number?
No.
Do you know how you caught me?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You can leave messages for me.
- Do you know how you caught me?
The reason you caught me, Will, is we're just alike.
Do you understand?
Smell yourself.
Gotcha.
- ...217 now boarding at Gate 12.
Eastern Airlines Flight 217 is now ready for boarding at Gate 12.
Get up against the bunk and face the wall.
Don't turn around, or I'll Mace you in the face.
Thank you so much.
I'll call you when I'm finished.
- Are you ready for your call?
Yes, thank you.
- Paltrow, Christiansen Golub, Law Offices.
Excuse me.
I must have misdialed.
- Thank you for using ATT.
This is Operator 24.
Operator, I don't have the use of my arms.
Would you be so kind as to dial a number for me, please?
Certainly.
What's the number?
Area code 301 , 555-6624.
- The University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry.
Dr. Sidney Bloom, please.
He's not in, but I'll connect you to his office.
What's his secretary's name again?
Martha King.
Just a moment, please.
- Martha King's desk.
Hi, Martha.
Martha doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob Greer of Blaine Edwards publishing company,
Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of The Psychiatrist and the Law to someone.
Martha never sent me the address and phone number.
She'll be in in the morning.
Well, I've got to catch Federal Express in about five minutes.
I'd be immensely appreciative if you could pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
I don't see a Rolodex.
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Yeah...
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
All right.
The name we're looking for, last name Graham, the man the book is supposed to be sent to, a Mr. Will Graham.
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation, 10th and Pennsylvania,
Washington, D.C.
Now, I'll bet it has his home address there, too.
3680 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida.
Thank you so very much.
I've finished.
Mom!
Oh, my gosh.
It's all right.
Stewardess!
- Ladies and gentlemen, we are beginning our descent into Birmingham.
- You used a cutting tool on the branch so that you could see.
Then you passed the time whittling and dreaming.
When night came, you saw them pass by their bright windows.
Then you watched the shades go down, then you saw the lights go out, one by one.
Then after a while, you climbed down and you went in to them, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You watched them all goddamned day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
- I need Firearms and Tool Marks section out here on a severed branch.
I need to know what kind of cutting tool he used.
And then I need Bowman in Documents to fall on this carving.
- Is it weird?
The mark?
Yeah.
If Documents can't do the carving, I'll send it up to Langley.
- Did Price get an identification off the Leeds print?
No, Price hasn't found him in the index yet.
It's a hand search.
He's got half his department on it.
Listen, have you seen this week's Tattler?
It's not on my preferred reading list.
Well, your picture's all over the front page.
Who the hell was it?
Lounds?
Of course.
Who else?
God damn it, Jack!
I promised Molly!
I promised her!
Come in.
- Dr. Chilton?
Yes?
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lecktor's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book.
We got him out of there and dug around.
Is that it?
Yes.
Put it down on my desk, Bonner.
Has anyone else seen this except you?
No.
- Special Agent Crawford's office.
This is Dr. Chilton.
I need to speak to Mr. Graham right away.
He's not here, he's in Birmingham.
Special Agent Crawford is on the line with him now.
Please tell them this is very, very urgent.
I'll hold on.
Dr. Chilton, it's Jack Crawford.
You have Will Graham on the line, too.
- I have a note, or two pieces of a note that appears to be from that man who killed those people in Atlanta.
Where did you get it?
In Hannibal Lecktor's cell.
It was hidden in a book.
- Don't touch the note.
Can you read it to us?
It's written on toilet tissue.
"My dear Dr. Lecktor,
"I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me.
"I know that you alone can understand what I am becoming.
"You alone know the people I use to help me in these things
"are only elements undergoing change
"to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming,
"just as the source of light is burning.
"I have a collection of your press clippings.
"I think they are absurd, as are mine.
"'The Tooth Fairy,' what could be more inappropriate?
"Investigator Graham interests me,
"very purposeful-looking.
"I hope we can correspond."
There's a piece missing here.
Now I'll read the bottom part.
"After I hear back from you,
"I might send you something wet."
Signed "Avid Fan."
It has teeth marks pressed into it at the bottom.
Order a chopper, next thing smoking.
I don't care whose it is.
Two, call Alabama Air National Guard, get Graham back here right now.
Then call Documents and tell them to scramble a team.
I want everybody moving five minutes ago.
You understand?
- I have a Documents team on its way to you by helicopter to pick up the note.
Listen, after we've worked the note,
I want to replace it in Lecktor's cell.
I don't want Lecktor to know that we've found it, he might try to warn the killer somehow.
Where's Lecktor now?
- Holding cell.
How long can you keep him in there without him getting suspicious?
- Three, four hours.
Brian, we have a note coming in on the flight, possibly from the Tooth Fairy, number one priority.
It has to go to Hair and Fiber,
Latent Prints, and then Documents.
Will Graham and I will be walking it through.
One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.
And a couple of blue grains.
Work the hair.
What do we have for negative comparison?
Hair from Lecktor's comb, whiskers from Lecktor's razor they let him use.
This is hair from the security guard.
- How many guys handled this without gloves?
The guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
The cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had the oil washed off his fingers.
But the others...
One smudge.
Those aren't ridges.
It's just the texture of the paper.
I can fume for a print, but can't guarantee the iodine stains would fade out.
Ninhydrin?
Boost it with heat?
No.
We couldn't wash it after.
I can't get a print off this in the time you've got to get it back, Will.
- How long do I have?
- Twenty minutes, max.
- The main thing to find out is, how was Lecktor supposed to reply to him?
Which is probably the missing section, because at the top it says,
"I hope we can correspond," then comes the gap.
This note was written in ballpoint, but it looks like Lecktor went over this area with a felt-tip pen, then tore it away.
You're so sly, but so am I.
The aniline dyes used in the ink of the felt-tip pens like Lecktor used are transparent to infrared.
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.
This looks like the tip of a T here, here, and here.
At the end is what could be the top of an R.
There's three Ts and an R in "Tattler."
We know our boy reads it.
The article about me and Lecktor.
I don't know anybody else that's carried that.
Personal ads.
We believe the Tooth Fairy told Lecktor to reply to him through the personal ad section of the National Tattler.
The Chicago office is down there right now running through their ads.
We have cut into a line of communication between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor.
If we find Lecktor's reply we plan to pull it, substitute it with one of our own.
And this is what the Tooth Fairy will read.
Bill?
"Dear Avid Fan, inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements.
"Mementoes for you at Baltimore Central Left Luggage.
"Ticket number 72683."
It's a Secret Service letter drop.
We plan to stake it out.
When he shows, we'll grab him.
Anything from Chicago?
- Not yet.
When do they go to press?
- Thirty-five minutes.
Christ.
Let's get to the physical.
There was no print.
Scale counts and core size of the hair match the blond hair found in the Jacobis'.
That note was written by your man.
Aside from the hair, three blue grains, dark flecks, went to Brian's end.
The grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine, from the cleaning man.
Several particles of dried blood, but not enough to type.
- This is Chester.
Who am I talking to?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford.
Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in it being telexed to you right now.
Read it. "Dear Avid Fan,
"You honor me.
You're very beautiful."
- Oh, Christ.
"I offer 100 prayers for your safety.
"Find help in Galatians 6:11, 15:2,
"Acts 3:3, Revelations 18:7,
"Jonah 6:8, John 6:22,
"Luke 1:7."
- Thanks.
Jimmy.
Did you get anywhere at all identifying him off the Leeds' prints?
Not yet.
Photography at Langley?
They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.
No.
And our ad has to go out in the same book code Lecktor used, or he'll know it wasn't Lecktor talking to him.
Book code?
"100 prayers" could be the page number, the paired numbers could be line and letter.
But what book?
- Not the Bible?
No.
Galatians 15:2.
Galatians only has six chapters.
The same with Jonah 6:8.
Jonah only has four chapters.
Lecktor was not using the Bible.
Then the Tooth Fairy probably named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
Right.
What about sweating Lecktor?
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.
He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
- Wonderful.
The Tooth Fairy would have named a book he knew Lecktor has access to.
He'd know it from articles he'd read about Lecktor.
- Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they can get everything back in place.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books.
- Where?
- Library of Congress.
Twenty-five minutes.
He won't make it in time.
Lecktor's ad runs as is, we decode it later.
Or we pull it, figure out the code and run our own ad next week.
And lose a week?
We got 17 days till the next full moon.
And I don't like Lecktor's ad running without knowing what it says.
It's your call, Will.
Run it.
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something else beside write?
We'll all feel sick for a very long time.
- And if Bowman still can't figure it out?
Then we'll bait him with something else in next week's Tattler.
- What, for instance?
Me.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
Why not?
Don't you think we can provoke him?
Maybe.
Maybe he can be provoked.
What I was thinking about is you.
You're getting deeper and deeper into this.
Good night.
Sidney.
I'll talk to you.
Last time you did that you did a real good job of pushing yourself all out of shape.
You try it on again or you go through some big trauma, you could relapse, my friend.
Sidney, don't worry about me.
I'm working the evidence, making moves.
That's all.
I'm fine.
Bowman just struck out.
It is not books in Lecktor's cell.
Price?
He just heard.
It's a bust-out.
As evidence, the Leeds print will get us a conviction if we could ever find the guy.
But he must never have been printed because he is not in our index.
We are not gonna identify him off the print.
I'll use Lounds.
What for?
Our boy doesn't read the New York Times literary supplement.
He reads Lounds in the Tattler.
What else should we cover?
He put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.
I believe he did this to make sure we wouldn't think he was gay.
He's molested all of his male victims.
He may be impotent with members of the opposite sex.
Our forensic psychologists have projected, though I'm not sure, that he may have had sexual relations with his mother.
So, how long do you plan to stay in Washington?
Till we've taken out the Tooth Fairy.
- Can the Tattler rely on getting the straight stuff from you?
Absolutely.
How does working on this case affect your sex life?
Mine?
It doesn't affect mine, it affects yours.
Go fuck yourself.
Look, pal of mine, you're news.
Shoot the pictures.
All right, Symie, let's shoot them.
I'm in the shots with Graham.
What?
I'm in the shots with you.
Come on, you want this to look real or not?
Make sure the theater sign across the street is just slightly out of focus.
We want him to be able to read it so he can find it, but we don't want to look too obvious.
You make sure that I look excellent.
All right, shoot it.
One more.
One more.
That's enough.
Okay, Graham.
Hey, always nice, huh?
Let's have lunch, call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.
Dr. Bloom.
I need them on my desk in two hours.
Did Bowman break the code yet?
No.
Tools and Firearms say the cutting tool used on the severed branch was a common bolt cutter.
I got a call from Asian Studies at Langley.
The mark you found on the tree?
Yeah?
It's a Chinese character considered a lucky sign in gambling.
That same character appears on a Mah Jongg piece.
It means "Red Dragon." Mean anything to you?
No.
If he shows, and he's smart, he'll approach you from the front, pass, turn, try and take you from behind.
How's your hearing?
It's good.
You'll wear a wire, one-way.
We'll hear you, you won't hear us.
You checked out a Charter Arms .44 Special Bulldog?
Yeah.
Load these in it.
You ever fire them?
Glaser Safety Slugs.
Yeah.
Number 12 shots.
Suspended in liquid Teflon in a copper casing.
On impact it all opens up in the target.
Guaranteed one-shot stop.
You got body armor?
Yeah, Kevlar Second Chance.
I hope you get one.
'Cause he's gone for the head shot eight of eleven times?
Let's walk the route.
- United Flight 849 to Newark now boarding at Gate 7...
United Flight 849 to Newark now boarding at Gate 7.
Someone's coming.
Go!
Don't!
Don't move!
Take the money!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Clear!
What you moving in slow motion for, man?
I'm being mugged!
For real.
Can you believe that?
Pay up.
- ...in sports, the Cubs lost again.
Hey! You know who I am?
I don't want to know who you are.
According to you, I'm a sexual pervert.
"An animal," you said.
You know who I am now?
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Open your eyes.
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.
Your job is to report.
That's why you're here.
And if you don't open your eyes,
I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Well, here I am.
Look at the screen.
William Blake's The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed In The Rays Of The Sun.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Leeds.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi.
Do you see?
Yes.
The next family as they will look when I go to visit them.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Leeds, later.
Her husband beside her.
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.
The Dragon rampant.
Freddie Lounds, your photograph.
No.
No what?
Not me, please.
Please.
Are you a man?
Yes.
Do you imply that I'm queer?
God, no.
Before me, you are a slug in the sun.
You are privy to a great becoming, and you recognize nothing.
You are an ant in the afterbirth.
It is your nature to do one thing correctly, tremble.
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, Lounds, you and the others, you owe me awe.
We have one more piece of work to do.
If he takes off the mask, I am a dead man.
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!
You will read this into the tape recorder.
Go.
"I have had a great privilege.
"I have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the Red Dragon.
"All I wrote about him were lies.
"Will Graham made me write them
"to pull him into a trap in Washington, District of Columbia.
"Will Graham, you will learn from my own lips
"how much you have to dread because I was forced to lie.
"He will be more merciful to me than to you.
"You will lie awake in fear of what the Red Dragon will do.
"I will be a testament to the truth of this." You did very well.
Will you let me go now?
Please?
You will tell the truth?
I promise.
Good.
We'll seal your promise with...
We'll seal your promise
with a kiss.
- We'll be showing five possible answers to the questions I'll be asking.
Any member of a team may buzz in an answer, but if incorrect, then the other team will have the opportunity... Bowman, just skip the cryptography and tell me what the hell it says, okay?
Did he try to say anything at all?
No, he sure didn't.
He never regained consciousness.
Did you hear the tape?
Yeah.
Listen, Bowman just broke the code that Lecktor used in the Tattler personal ad.
It was the State of Maryland statutes.
You need to know what it said right now.
What?
Listen to me.
Everything is okay.
I've taken care of it.
What is it, Jack?
The bastard gave him your home address.
It said, "Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway,
"Captiva, Florida.
"Save yourself.
Kill them all."
Get me a plane.
Will!
Mom.
Huh?
What time...
What?
Someone's outside.
There are noises.
Where?
Outside.
Mom...
Go back to your room and close the door.
Mom...
Do it now.
Ma'am, are you all right?
What?
What is it?
What is it?
What's going on?
- Ma'am, I think you should come back inside.
What's going on?
Come back inside.
Please.
I think you should come back inside.
I'm sorry, Molly.
I'm sorry about all of this.
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.
He's after you now, isn't he?
This is just a precaution.
Kevin, why don't you run down to the water, check out the dock?
I want to hang around here.
I'm in the kitchen, Mom.
Okay.
What is that about?
What, he's afraid to leave you alone with me now?
He saw the article in the Tattler, right?
I wanted to talk with him about it, but he said he wanted to bring it up to you, face to face.
Good for him.
Kevin, help me unpack, will you?
Then we'll go get some groceries.
You and Mom are very well-protected, you know.
No one's gonna find out where you are.
- Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
No.
- This guy is trying to kill us?
We don't know that.
When are you going to kill him?
I'm not.
It's only my job to find him.
Barry's mom had this newspaper.
It said you were in a special hospital.
Well, it was a regular hospital, then I was transferred into the psychiatric wing.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
I don't know.
Was it because in the papers it said it was this man Lecktor?
Mmm-hmm.
What happened?
Well, Lecktor was attacking college girls, then he killed them.
How?
In bad ways.
He was a psychiatrist.
One of the girls was his patient, and I went to talk to him about her.
I tried to build feelings in my imagination like the killer had so that I would know why he did what he did, because that would help me find him.
When I was sitting in Lecktor's office and I looked up, I saw a book on his shelf.
It had pictures of war wounds in it.
And I knew it was him.
So I went to a pay phone down the hall to call the police and that's when he attacked me.
You and Mom came to see me in the hospital, and that helped a lot.
But after my body got okay,
I still had his thoughts going around in my head.
And I stopped talking to people.
And a doctor friend of mine, a Dr. Bloom, asked me to get some help.
And I did.
Then after a while I felt better, and I was okay again.
And the way he thought felt that bad?
Kevin, they're the ugliest thoughts in the world.
So, what kind of coffee do you like?
You like that Folgers stuff, right?
Yeah.
Mom likes that, too.
When can we go home, Dad?
I don't know, Kevin.
So, where are things?
Nowhere.
Everything we've tried is either a dead end or it's backfired.
Crawford's already planning the next crime scene so they can get it fresh.
We've got about six more days till the next full moon.
Can you quit?
No.
What's next?
I go to Atlanta.
Crawford?
No.
I have to be alone.
You're talking about doing exactly what you said you...
This killing, it's gotta stop.
William, you're gonna make yourself sick.
Or get yourself killed.
You and Kevin should go to Montana.
See your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.
And I'll come up and get you afterwards.
- Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry I can't come to the phone right now.
I'm sorry, too.
- Excuse me.
Coffee.
It's just you and me now, sport.
I'm gonna find you, God damn it.
Mr. Dollarhyde?
Eileen.
Bill told me to tell you there was a variation in the gamma of number three.
But he caught it in time.
Eileen, good.
Good.
- Who's there?
Mr. Dollarhyde.
I came about the low-light infrared emulsion.
- Oh, yeah.
Come on in, it's safe.
Put your back against the door.
There's a stool just to your right.
You're the production controller from Admin, right?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions?
Shooting from maybe eight feet.
I can't use any lights.
Okay, what's being photographed?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
Four days.
Okay, let me stick this in the black hole.
1000-C infrared sensitive has to be handled in total darkness.
Remember to be very careful with it.
But still, it's easier to handle than the 1200 series.
It'll be fine.
In case you're wondering,
I keep the samples straight by touch code.
No, I wasn't wondering.
Reba, I gotta fly.
Maybe Mr. Dollarhyde can drive you home tonight.
No, that's okay.
I'll take care of myself.
- I can change things around.
No, thanks, go on.
Okay.
I'll take you.
No, thanks.
I'll order you 1200 feet of 1000-C in the morning.
Ride with me.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus.
I do it all the time.
Ride with me.
It would be because I would like you to.
Okay, sure.
Let me get my stuff on.
How did you come to Gateway?
Oh, they had to hire the handicapped to shape up their employment practices to get this defense contract.
You worked out well.
Everybody they hired did.
You know, you speak very well.
Although you avoid fricatives and sibilants.
At the Riker Institute for the Blind,
I trained in therapy for speech and hearing-impaired children.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Mmm-hmm.
You know, if you don't want to talk, that's okay.
But I hope you will, because you're very direct, and I like that, and I like what you have to say.
May I touch your face?
I want to know whether you're smiling or frowning.
I guess I want to know whether I should be quiet or not.
Take my word for it.
I'm smiling.
I didn't mean to offend you.
On the way, can I take you somewhere?
Where?
It would be my surprise.
Okay, sure.
Are you apprehensive?
No.
The very protective Mr. Dollarhyde over there is watching us.
No, no, I want to.
In about two hours we're going to cap his tooth.
- Yeah.
- It's warm.
Back a little bit.
There.
You hear it?
Yeah.
You rearrange the dead families into an audience to see what you do.
You think that what you do will make you into something different.
You are becoming.
What is it you think you're becoming?
The answer is in the way you use the mirrors.
What do the mirrors make you dream you're becoming? A little to your left.
Francis, that was a great dinner.
Thank you.
I made you a gin and tonic.
It's right in front of you.
What are you watching?
It's just a little homework.
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, D.
Is there a fire in the sky?
Your heart's loud.
Is there a moon up there?
If you'll hold me...
Is anything alive now?
This darkness is what I hear
This is a breathless silence
A moment out of time
I see your face in the shadows
The tell-tale signs are in your eyes
Aching with a passion inside
Deep as the river
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
Is there a flame in the dark?
Is there a bright heart star?
These creatures look the same now
We freeze wherever we are
We wake alone in the blackness
We sleep wherever we fall
One dream all around us
This big hush infects us all
Forever in this half-light
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside And the light from you
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
- Is that you, D?
- Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Hi.
Good morning.
Morning.
You know, if you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee.
No, no...
Don't go back inside the house.
Why?
I left my purse inside.
I'll get it.
It's okay.
I mean, you should stay outside, it's...
It's...
It's 'cause you look so good in the sun.
Okay.
When...
Reba, when can I see you again?
Oh!
Um...
We could meet at my house.
- You got the message Lecktor called?
Yeah.
I arranged for him to have a phone.
I gotta call him in a few minutes.
Good.
Listen, we identified the tire tracks left when Lounds was delivered back to the Tattler.
G-7816 Goodyear truck tires.
Looks like our boy drives a van.
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you coming back?
When I'm done, Jack.
Yeah, this is Will Graham of the FBI.
Dr. Chilton arranged for me to talk to Dr. Lecktor.
Hello?
- Hello, Will.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds.
I admire that enormously.
Oh, what a cunning boy you are.
I'm sick of you crazy sons of bitches.
You got something to say, say it.
I want to help you.
You'd be more comfortable if you relax with yourself.
We don't invent our natures, they're issued to us, along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else.
Why fight it?
Fight what?
Did you really feel so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death?
I didn't know you then, but I think you probably did.
But it wasn't the act that got you down, was it?
Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?
And why shouldn't it feel good?
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.
God's terrific.
He dropped a church roof on 34 of his worshippers last Wednesday night in Texas as they were groveling through a hymn to his majesty.
Don't you think that felt good?
Why does it feel good, Dr. Lecktor?
It feels good, Will, because God has power.
And if one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.
He got 140 Filipinos in one plane crash last month.
Remember that earthquake in Italy last spring?
- I enter.
The glass cutter.
The piece of glass I take out is mine.
The house is mine.
I walk up these stairs,
I pass the children's toys.
The children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.
I move to the door.
I step into the room.
I see you there.
And I see me desired by you.
Accepted and loved in the silver mirrors of your eyes.
Father, look in my eyes
See me as I really am
You made me
Now take me
- I'm gonna talk to Fogel tomorrow...
Tell me how it feels now
Behold your flesh has come of age
- Wait a minute.
Forsake me, you break me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that scares me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that dares me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that haunts me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that taunts me
Mother, let me heal you
Your pain has lasted far too long
Release it, it kills you
What was it?
Pollen.
Oh.
Thanks for the ride.
See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
The love you would not share grows tired of waiting Mr. Dollarhyde.
What are you doing here? Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that scares me
Strong as I am
- Who is it?
- lt's me.
Who?
Who is it?
- It's me.
Oh.
Francis?
No, not Francis.
Francis is gone.
Francis is gone forever.
So, what are we doing?
The dream.
He dreams about being wanted and desired, so he changes people into beings who want and desire him.
Changes?
It's a word.
Killing and arranging the people to imitate it.
And Lecktor told me something.
If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
You put it together, you get, if our boy imitates being wanted and desired enough times, he believes he will become one who is wanted and desired and accepted.
It'll all come true.
This started from an abused kid, a battered infant.
There's something terrible about...
- What, are you sympathizing with this guy now?
Absolutely.
My heart bleeds for him as a child.
Someone took a kid and manufactured a monster.
At the same time, as an adult, he's irredeemable.
He butchers whole families to pursue trivial fantasies.
As an adult, someone should blow this sick fuck out of his socks.
Do you think that's a contradiction, Jack?
Does this kind of understanding make you uncomfortable?
What about the mirrors?
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.
But he doesn't take anything.
There's no souvenirs taken from the houses.
He needs souvenirs or trophies to re-live the event.
Maybe he records it somehow.
So he could see himself accepted over and over and over again.
VTRs, Polaroids, stills, what?
How do I know?
How does he find them?
When we find out how he found them, we'll find him.
There is no connection between the two families.
We've done a dozen computer runs.
Jack, all the women have a bloom on them.
He didn't win them in a lottery, he picked these women.
There's selection and design in his choices.
Look, admit we struck out this month.
The Lear Jet is standing by, the basic lab stuff is on it.
You, Zeller, Jimmy Price, the photographer, anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and 15 minutes.
We get the call, we roll.
The scene will be fresher than we've ever had it.
It's not over yet.
For Christ's sake!
That's a foregone conclusion.
It's 11:30 p.m., the full moon is happening tonight.
Give it up!
Forget this month, it's too damn late!
I gave it up.
Till you showed up with pictures of two dead families, knowing goddamn well that I'd imagine families three, four, five and six.
Right?
You're fucking right I did, and I'd do it again!
Great!
But don't talk to me about late, pal,
I'll tell you when it's too fucking late!
Until then, we go as late as I want to take it! A padlock.
That's why the bolt cutter.
What's that?
He used a bolt cutter to trim away the branch when he was watching from the woods.
Why didn't he use the bolt cutter on the garage door?
Because a deadbolt was there when they were killed.
Donald Jacobi's 12th birthday party was April 14th.
Sometime between April 14th and August 1 they changed the lock.
But he thought there was a padlock there.
From the street, you can't see the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door.
There's a big, high fence there.
But he was ready with his glass cutter.
So either he was casing far ahead and we didn't check back far enough,
or...
- We checked.
Don't talk.
Metcalfe, is the Leeds and Jacobi stuff still in the storeroom?
Have the guard down there call me.
Do it.
You know that's the Jacobis' cat.
You brought a bolt cutter 'cause you thought there was a padlock.
The Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog, don't you, my man?
See the woman?
The bloom on the woman?
You can see her again and again anytime you want.
Doggie doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog.
And the Jacobi cat.
And the padlock on the door.
And you know you need a bolt cutter and every other goddamn thing because everything with you is seeing, isn't it?
Your primary sensory intake that makes your dream live is seeing.
Reflections, mirrors, images...
You've seen these films.
Haven't you, my man? It's the guard in the storeroom.
The cans.
What cans?
The tapes were transferred from home movies.
Where's the packaging the films came in?
There's films of the families in the document storage.
Find them.
You got them?
Are there any labels?
Leeds can, Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
The Jacobi label will say the same thing as the Leeds label.
Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
- Who processed the Jacobi film?
No.
Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.
Stores send them out.
Have him peel the top label back.
- Is there a label underneath?
It does, doesn't it?
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes to Meigs Field.
At Meigs Field,
I want the Lear Jet prepped and a plan filed with St. Louis.
Where are you?
Are you here? You're scaring me with this!
Will you just stop it?
Francis, why are you doing this to me?
It's ugly!
Don't you know that I'll always be true?
Are you in this room?
Where are you?
You answer me!
And take my hand
Oh, won't you come with me
And walk this land
Please, take my hand
- We're looking for a man.
We know he works at Gateway.
We don't have his name, but we know he drives a van.
- Under "Employee Facilities,"
I've got special stickers for vans.
Yeah, I got 28, 29 van permits in the computer.
- Start feeding me names.
Is this Lieutenant Fisk?
Will Graham.
Listen, I need you to punch up the driver's licenses of the names I'm gonna feed you.
The man we're looking for is blond, Caucasian, twenty to forty years old, over six feet tall, 180 to 225 pounds.
First name?

A-L-V-A-R-O.
First name Joseph.

First name Lincoln.

Six foot-seven, 217 pounds.
Eyes brown, hair blond.
Thirty-four years old.
Put it through the data-fax.
Fast.
You guys better buckle up.
We're on approach to Lambert Field.
- Fogel has four more names.
He knows two, both dark hair, third's a woman, fourth is a handicapped parking permit.
This is our man.
Rural Route 3, Chester, Missouri.
Where is that?
From the airport you're a few minutes closer.
We'll 10-25 at the Hark Road off ramp, Highway 94.
Let's go! Meet point's up ahead.
Go on to the house.
But Lieutenant Fisk said...
Go on to the house.
- Will?
You're not gonna need that.
A SWAT team is gonna take him down, not us.
Will? Will!
- This ought to be it right here.
Kill your lights.
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.
Griffin's hurt bad.
I'll wait for the backup.
- Set up a roadblock on Route 3.
Graham and I are in the trees west of the house.
- How far away is the backup unit?
I'm going around the back.
Stay in the trees.
He's in there, Jack.
And he's got somebody in there with him.
- What?
Will, what did you say?
- Will.
Wait for the backup, Will.
He's got somebody in the house with him, Jack.
- Will.
Stop it.
Stop it! Three, four
In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey
Don't you know that I love you?
In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby
Don't you know that I'll always be true?
Oh, won't you come with me
And take my hand
Oh, won't you come with me
And walk this land
Please, take my hand It's okay.
Who are you?
Graham.

We should've talked at the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk about it here.
I'm not falling all over myself to talk about it much of anywhere, Jack.
How much do you know?
Not much.
The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago.
The second one in Atlanta was all over TV.
Did you ever think about giving me a call?
No.
Why not?
I quit.
Remember?
You look all right now.
I am all right.
If you can't look anymore, I understand.
Don't try to run a game down on me, Jack.
If I really didn't need you to come back, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks and a few days until the next full moon.
We have a better chance to get him fast if you help.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
Hi, Molly.
Think it'll keep them out, Dad?
Yep.
How many turtle eggs do you think are in here?
In this hatchery?
I'll bet there's 40 or 50 of them.
Crabs get most of the newborns, huh?
Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it, guaranteed.
What about the dogs?
Are they gonna get in here?
They can't dig under.
That's why we bury the wire down in the sand.
We need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be his friend, Jack.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, Molly,
I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.
We got it pretty good, don't we?
We have it more than good.
All that happened to you before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only look at evidence.
I wouldn't get deeply involved.
He'd never even see me or know my name.
If they find him, they'll have to take him down, not me.
What do you think?
I think you've already decided and you're not really asking.
If I were asking?
Stay here with me, me and Kevin.
But it's selfish, and I know it.
Come here.
I'll come inside with you, if you want, to show you around.
Mr. Crawford said maybe you'd want to be alone, but--
That's right.
There's a VCR hooked up in your hotel room.
They transferred some home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen sliding door.
Used a glass cutter anchored to a suction cup.
His entry was skillful.
All the prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair, strong, size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood AB positive, typed from saliva on glass from licking the suction cup.
Why didn't he care that he left saliva on the glass?
It was hot out that night, so inside the house must have felt cool to him.
Intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he was rising, then shot Mrs. Leeds.
Bullet entered right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation.
Moderate elevation of serotonin and marked increase of free histamine level in gunshot wound indicates she lived at least five minutes after she was shot.
All her other injuries were post-mortem.
Direction and velocity of bloodstains on east wall indicate arterial spray.
Even with his throat cut, Leeds tried to fight because the intruder was moving to the children's room.
Bloodstains on west wall of master bedroom and matted sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained,
as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leeds' chest, also believed to be post-mortem.
What did the killer do with them after they were dead?
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry, I can't come to the phone right now, but if you'd like to leave a message please do so after the beep, and I'll call you back as soon as I can.
Twenty-ninth floor.
Going up.
When they were dead, he smashed the mirrors and began selecting pieces that he would use later on Mrs. Leeds.
Killing Mr. Leeds and the children would take less than a minute.
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem, four or five minutes later.
What did he do in the interval?
The smeared bloodstains on the west wall...
- Hello?
- Molly?
Will, is that you?
Yeah, it's me, honey.
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
I love you.
I love you too, baby.
What are you dreaming?
That's something you can't afford for me to know about, isn't it?
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
It was maddening to have to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg, but there wasn't any talcum powder in the bathroom.
The talcum powder came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You touched her with your bare hands, and then you put your gloves back on.
But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so that they could see you?
Hello?
Jack, this is Graham.
Is Price still in Latent Prints?
Yeah, he's in charge of the Single Print Index now.
What do you got, Will?
Get him to Atlanta.
Atlanta PD swears they dusted everything, and their guy is pretty good.
He is good.
He's not as good as Price.
I'll get him on a plane in the morning.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails and the corneas of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves, Jack.
Our people swear he wore surgeon's gloves the whole time.
They dusted everything.
Your report didn't mention eyes.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
Because Mrs. Leeds was a beautiful woman.
This is what the subject's teeth looked like.
The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed these from the impressions that we took of the bite marks on the Leeds woman here and the Jacobi woman in Birmingham last month.
As you can see, he has pegged lateral incisors, that's these teeth here and here.
All right, Vice and Narcotics, you take the K-Y cowboys and leather bars.
Marcus, Whitman, heads up at the funeral.
The rest of your assignments are on the sheet.
Let's go.
One more thing.
I've heard officers referring to this killer as the Tooth Fairy.
Well, I don't want to hear that in public, and I don't want to see it in internal memoranda.
That's it.
I know a burglar's gonna fence what he stole 'cause his motive is cash money.
I know his motive, so I go to work on fences.
This guy, we don't even have motive.
None of us have shit, and we know it.
It's in his dreams.
- His motive?
- Yeah.
His act fuels his fantasy.
Which is?
I don't know.
The commissioner was saying that you're the one who got Garrett Jacob Hobbs, and then Dr. Lecktor three years ago.
Lecktor killed nine people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
What happened to them?
One's on a respirator at a hospital in Baltimore, the other's in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
The psychologists call him a psychopath.
They don't know what else to call him.
I understand he cut you pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's.
The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen.
The Jacobis in Birmingham had a cat, didn't they?
That's right.
We found a litter box downstairs, but we didn't find a cat.
Why don't you get Birmingham PD a methane probe out of Washington, have them cover the back yard.
Maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
Yeah?
This is Jimmy Price, FBI.
Let me put you on speakerphone.
Who am I talking to?
Jimmy, it's Jack Crawford.
You got Will Graham here, too.
I got a partial print with a tented arch, it's probably a thumb.
And the fragment of a palm off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.
Thumbprint came off the oldest kid's left eye.
It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.
Can we make an identification off of it?
Maybe, if he's ever been printed and he's in my index.
I want to work these up in my own darkroom.
I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon.
Thanks, Jimmy.
No comment.
If we get lucky with that print, we're in, if Jimmy can find him in the index and if he's ever been printed.
- If not, I don't know.
- Hey, Will Graham!
What do you say?
You remember me?
Freddie Lounds, covered the Lecktor case for the Tattler, did the paperback.
So, Will, when did they call you in?
What do you got?
Hey, look, I'm buying lunch.
Lounds, why don't you give it a rest?
Hey, he's news.
I'm doing my job.
So, how does this guy compare with Lecktor?
How does he do them?
How's he do them, Will?
Keep the fuck away from me.
Will, Will.
Son of a bitch snuck into the hospital while I was sedated after Lecktor.
He pulled back the sheets, and he took pictures.
Yeah, I know.
Look, don't expect too much from me, all right?
We only got three weeks left, and you're our best shot.
You think I'm gonna see him standing in the street and say, "There he is"?
That's Houdini you're thinking about.
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on until we get smart or get lucky.
He won't stop.
Why?
He's got a genuine taste for it.
You do know something about him.
Not enough.
I think I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mindset.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Yeah, I keep getting it for Christmas.
Did you get my card?
I got it.
Thank you.
How is Officer Stewart?
The one who was first to see my basement.
Stewart's fine.
Emotional problems, I hear.
Do you have any problems, Will?
No.
No, of course you don't.
I'm glad you came.
My callers are mostly clinical psychologists from cornfield universities somewhere.
Second-raters, the lot.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
And?
Very interesting.
Even to a layman.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
Yes, I thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Yes?
You read about it?
In the papers.
I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
I thought you might have some ideas.
Why should I tell you?
You'd get to see the file on this case.
And there's another reason.
Pray tell.
Thought you might be curious to see if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
Then by implication you think you're smarter than me, since you caught me.
No.
I know that I'm not smarter than you.
Then how did you catch me?
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantages?
You're insane.
You are very tan, Will.
Your hands are rough.
They don't look like cop's hands anymore.
And that shaving lotion is something a child would select.
It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it?
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
I don't think I'll persuade you at all.
You'll either do it or you won't.
Besides, we have Dr. Bloom working on it, and he's the best.
- Do you have the file with you?
- Yes.
- Pictures?
- Yes.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
No.
Dream much, Will?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file, and I'll tell you what I think.
This is a very shy boy, Will.
What were their yards like?
Big back yards.
Fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, my dear Will, if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he might go outside to look at it.
Have you ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy for this sort of thing.
That's interesting.
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.
I considered it.
You came here to look at me, to get the old scent back again, didn't you?
I want your opinion.
I don't have one right now.
Well, when you have one, I'd like to hear it.
Can I keep this?
I haven't decided yet.
I'll study them.
When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too.
You can call me.
When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone.
Would you like to leave me your home phone number?
No.
Do you know how you caught me?
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You can leave messages for me.
Do you know how you caught me?
The reason you caught me, Will, is we're just alike.
Do you understand?
Smell yourself.
Gotcha.
217 now boarding at Gate 12.
Eastern Airlines Flight 217 is now ready for boarding at Gate 12.
Get up against the bunk and face the wall.
Don't turn around, or I'll Mace you in the face.
Thank you so much.
I'll call you when I'm finished.
Are you ready for your call?
Yes, thank you.
Paltrow, Christiansen Golub, Law Offices.
Excuse me.
I must have misdialed.
Thank you for using ATT.
This is Operator 24.
Operator, I don't have the use of my arms.
Would you be so kind as to dial a number for me, please?
Certainly.
What's the number?
Area code 301, 555-6624.
The University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry.
Dr. Sidney Bloom, please.
He's not in, but I'll connect you to his office.
What's his secretary's name again?
Martha King.
Just a moment, please.
Martha King's desk.
Hi, Martha.
Martha doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob Greer of Blaine Edwards publishing company,
Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of The Psychiatrist and the Law to someone.
Martha never sent me the address and phone number.
She'll be in in the morning.
Well, I've got to catch Federal Express in about five minutes.
I'd be immensely appreciative if you could pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
I don't see a Rolodex.
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
- Yeah--
- Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
All right.
The name we're looking for, last name Graham, the man the book is supposed to be sent to, a Mr. Will Graham.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, 10th and Pennsylvania,
Washington, D.C.
Now, I'll bet it has his home address there, too.
3680 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida.
Thank you so very much.
I've finished.
- Mom!
- Oh, my gosh.
It's all right.
Stewardess!
Ladies and gentlemen, we are beginning our descent into Birmingham.
You used a cutting tool on the branch so that you could see.
Then you passed the time whittling and dreaming.
When night came, you saw them pass by their bright windows.
Then you watched the shades go down, then you saw the lights go out, one by one.
Then after a while, you climbed down and you went in to them, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You watched them all goddamned day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
I need Firearms and Tool Marks section out here on a severed branch.
I need to know what kind of cutting tool he used.
And then I need Bowman in Documents to fall on this carving.
Is it weird?
The mark?
Yeah.
If Documents can't do the carving, I'll send it up to Langley.
Did Price get an identification off the Leeds print?
No, Price hasn't found him in the index yet.
It's a hand search.
He's got half his department on it.
Listen, have you seen this week's Tattler?
It's not on my preferred reading list, Jack.
Well, uh-- your picture's all over the front page.
Who the hell was it?
Lounds?
Of course.
Who else?
God damn it, Jack!
I promised Molly!
I promised her!
Come in.
Dr. Chilton?
Yes?
When we were cleaning out Dr. Lecktor's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book.
We got him out of there and dug around.
- Is that it?
- Yes.
Put it down on my desk, Bonner.
Has anyone else seen this except you?
No.
Special Agent Crawford's office.
This is Dr. Chilton.
I need to speak to Mr. Graham right away.
He's not here, he's in Birmingham.
Special Agent Crawford is on the line with him now.
Please tell them this is very, very urgent.
I'll hold on.
Dr. Chilton, it's Jack Crawford.
You have Will Graham on the line, too.
I have a note, or two pieces of a note that appears to be from that man who killed those people in Atlanta.
Dr. Chilton, where did you get it?
In Hannibal Lecktor's cell.
It was hidden in a book.
Dr. Chilton, don't touch the note.
Can you read it to us?
It's written on toilet tissue.
"My dear Dr. Lecktor,
"I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me.
"I know that you alone can understand what I am becoming.
"You alone know the people I use to help me in these things
"are only elements undergoing change
"to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming,
"just as the source of light is burning.
"I have a collection of your press clippings.
"I think they are absurd, as are mine.
"'The Tooth Fairy,' what could be more inappropriate?
"Investigator Graham interests me,
"very purposeful-looking.
"I hope we can correspond."
There's a piece missing here.
Now I'll read the bottom part.
"After I hear back from you,
"I might send you something wet."
Signed "Avid Fan."
It has teeth marks pressed into it at the bottom.
Order a chopper, next thing smoking.
I don't care whose it is.
Two, call Alabama Air National Guard, get Graham back here right now.
Then call Documents and tell them to scramble a team.
I want everybody moving five minutes ago.
You understand?
I have a Documents team on its way to you by helicopter to pick up the note.
Listen, after we've worked the note,
I want to replace it in Lecktor's cell.
I don't want Lecktor to know that we've found it, he might try to warn the killer somehow.
Where's Lecktor now?
Holding cell.
How long can you keep him in there without him getting suspicious?
Three, four hours.
Brian, we have a note coming in on the flight, possibly from the Tooth Fairy, number one priority.
It has to go to Hair and Fiber,
Latent Prints, and then Documents.
Will Graham and I will be walking it through.
One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.
And a couple of blue grains.
Work the hair.
What do we have for negative comparison?
Hair from Lecktor's comb, whiskers from Lecktor's razor they let him use.
This is hair from the security guard.
How many guys handled this without gloves?
The guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
The cleanup man scrubbing sinks, probably had the oil washed off his fingers.
But the others--
One smudge.
Those aren't ridges.
It's just the texture of the paper.
I can fume for a print, but can't guarantee the iodine stains would fade out.
Ninhydrin?
Boost it with heat?
No.
We couldn't wash it after.
I can't get a print off this in the time you've got to get it back, Will.
How long do I have?
Twenty minutes, max.
The main thing to find out is, how was Lecktor supposed to reply to him?
Which is probably the missing section, because at the top it says,
"I hope we can correspond," then comes the gap.
This note was written in ballpoint, but it looks like Lecktor went over this area with a felt-tip pen, then tore it away.
You're so sly, but so am I.
The aniline dyes used in the ink of the felt-tip pens like Lecktor used are transparent to infrared.
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.
This looks like the tip of a T here, here, and here.
At the end is what could be the top of an R.
There's three Ts and an R in "Tattler".
We know our boy reads it.
The article about me and Lecktor.
I don't know anybody else that's carried that.
Personal ads.
We believe the Tooth Fairy told Lecktor to reply to him through the personal ad section of the National Tattler.
The Chicago office is down there right now running through their ads.
We have cut into a line of communication between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor.
If we find Lecktor's reply we plan to pull it, substitute it with one of our own.
And this is what the Tooth Fairy will read.
Bill?
"Dear Avid Fan, inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements.
"Mementoes for you at Baltimore Central Left Luggage.
"Ticket number 72683."
It's a Secret Service letter drop.
We plan to stake it out.
When he shows, we'll grab him.
- Anything from Chicago?
- Not yet.
When do they go to press?
Thirty-five minutes.
- Christ.
- Let's get to the physical.
There was no print.
Scale counts and core size of the hair match the blond hair found in the Jacobis'.
That note was written by your man.
Aside from the hair, three blue grains, dark flecks, went to Brian's end.
The grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine, from the cleaning man.
Several particles of dried blood, but not enough to type.
This is Chester.
Who am I talking to?
Will Graham, Jack Crawford.
Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in it being telexed to you right now.
- Read it.
- "Dear Avid Fan,
"You honor me.
You're very beautiful."
Oh, Christ.
"I offer 100 prayers for your safety.
"Find help in Galatians 6:11, 15:2,
"Acts 3:3, Revelations 18:7,
"Jonah 6:8, John 6:22,
"Luke 1:7."
Thanks.
Jimmy.
Did you get anywhere at all identifying him off the Leeds' prints?
Not yet.
Photography at Langley?
They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.
No.
And our ad has to go out in the same book code Lecktor used, or he'll know it wasn't Lecktor talking to him.
Book code?
"100 prayers" could be the page number, the paired numbers could be line and letter.
- But what book?
- Not The Bible?
No.
Galatians 15:2.
Galatians only has six chapters.
The same with Jonah 6:8.
Jonah only has four chapters.
Lecktor was not using The Bible.
Then the Tooth Fairy probably named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
Right.
What about sweating Lecktor?
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.
He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
Wonderful.
The Tooth Fairy would have named a book he knew Lecktor has access to.
He'd know it from articles he'd read about Lecktor.
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they can get everything back in place.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books.
- Where?
- Library of Congress.
Twenty-five minutes.
He won't make it in time.
Lecktor's ad runs as is, we decode it later.
Or we pull it, figure out the code and run our own ad next week.
And lose a week?
We got 17 days till the next full moon.
And I don't like Lecktor's ad running without knowing what it says.
It's your call, Will.
Run it.
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something else beside write?
We'll all feel sick for a very long time.
And if Bowman still can't figure it out?
Then we'll bait him with something else in next week's Tattler.
What, for instance?
Me.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
Why not?
Don't you think we can provoke him?
Maybe.
Maybe he can be provoked.
What I was thinking about is you.
You're getting deeper and deeper into this.
Good night.
Sidney.
I'll talk to you.
Last time you did that you did a real good job of pushing yourself all out of shape.
You try it on again or you go through some big trauma, you could relapse, my friend.
Sidney, don't worry about me.
I'm working the evidence, making moves.
That's all.
I'm fine.
Bowman just struck out.
It is not books in Lecktor's cell.
Price?
He just heard.
It's a bust-out.
As evidence, the Leeds print will get us a conviction if we could ever find the guy.
But he must never have been printed because he is not in our index.
We are not gonna identify him off the print.
I'll use Lounds.
What for?
Our boy doesn't read The New York Times literary supplement.
He reads Lounds in the Tattler.
What else should we cover?
He put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.
I believe he did this to make sure we wouldn't think he was gay.
He's molested all of his male victims.
He may be impotent with members of the opposite sex.
Our forensic psychologists have projected, though I'm not sure, that he may have had sexual relations with his mother.
So, how long do you plan to stay in Washington?
Till we've taken out the Tooth Fairy.
Can the Tattler rely on getting the straight stuff from you?
Absolutely.
How does working on this case affect your sex life?
Mine?
It doesn't affect mine, it affects yours.
Go fuck yourself.
Look, pal of mine, you're news.
Shoot the pictures.
All right, Symie, let's shoot them.
I'm in the shots with Graham.
- What?
- I'm in the shots with you.
Come on, you want this to look real or not?
Make sure the theater sign across the street is just slightly out of focus.
We want him to be able to read it so he can find it, but we don't want to look too obvious.
You make sure that I look excellent.
All right, shoot it.
One more.
- One more.
- That's enough.
Okay, Graham.
Hey, always nice, huh?
Let's have lunch, call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.
Dr. Bloom.
I need them on my desk in two hours.
Did Bowman break the code yet?
No.
Tools and Firearms say the cutting tool used on the severed branch was a common bolt cutter.
I got a call from Asian Studies at Langley.
- The mark you found on the tree?
- Yeah?
It's a Chinese character considered a lucky sign in gambling.
That same character appears on a Mah Jongg piece.
It means "Red Dragon." Mean anything to you?
No.
If he shows, and he's smart, he'll approach you from the front, pass, turn, try and take you from behind.
How's your hearing?
It's good.
You'll wear a wire, one-way.
We'll hear you, you won't hear us.
You checked out a Charter Arms .44 Special Bulldog?
Yeah.
Load these in it.
You ever fire them?
Glaser Safety Slugs.
Yeah.
Number 12 shots.
Suspended in liquid Teflon in a copper casing.
On impact it all opens up in the target.
Guaranteed one-shot stop.
You got body armor?
Yeah, Kevlar Second Chance.
I hope you get one.
'Cause he's gone for the head shot eight of eleven times?
Let's walk the route.
United Flight 849 to Newark now boarding at Gate 7.
United Flight 849 to Newark now boarding at Gate 7.
Someone's coming.
Go!
Don't!
Don't move!
Take the money!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Clear!
What you moving in slow motion for, man?
I'm being mugged!
For real.
Can you believe that?
Pay up.
...in sports, the Cubs lost again.
Hey!
You know who I am?
I don't want to know who you are.
According to you, I'm a sexual pervert.
"An animal," you said.
You know who I am now?
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Open your eyes.
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.
Your job is to report.
That's why you're here.
And if you don't open your eyes,
I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Well, here I am.
Look at the screen.
William Blake's The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed In The Rays Of The Sun.
- Do you see?
- Yes.
Mrs. Leeds.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi.
Do you see?
Yes.
The next family as they will look when I go to visit them.
- Do you see?
- Yes.
Mrs. Leeds, later.
Her husband beside her.
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.
The Dragon rampant.
Freddie Lounds, your photograph.
No.
No what?
Not me, please.
Please.
Are you a man?
Yes.
Do you imply that I'm queer?
God, no.
Before me, you are a slug in the sun.
You are privy to a great becoming, and you recognize nothing.
You are an ant in the afterbirth.
It is your nature to do one thing correctly, tremble.
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, Lounds, you and the others, you owe me awe.
We have one more piece of work to do.
If he takes off the mask, I am a dead man.
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!
You will read this into the tape recorder.
Go.
"I have had a great privilege.
"I have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the Red Dragon.
"All I wrote about him were lies.
"Will Graham made me write them
"to pull him into a trap in Washington, District of Columbia.
"Will Graham, you will learn from my own lips
"how much you have to dread because I was forced to lie.
"He will be more merciful to me than to you.
"You will lie awake in fear of what the Red Dragon will do.
"I will be a testament to the truth of this."
You did very well.
Will you let me go now?
Please?
You will tell the truth?
I promise.
Good.
We'll seal your promise with...
We'll seal your promise... with a kiss.
We'll be showing five possible answers to the questions I'll be asking.
Any member of a team may buzz in an answer, but if incorrect, then the other team will have the opportunity...
Bowman, just skip the cryptography and tell me what the hell it says, okay?
Did he try to say anything at all?
No, he sure didn't.
He never regained consciousness.
Did you hear the tape?
Yeah.
Listen, Bowman just broke the code that Lecktor used in the Tattler personal ad.
It was the State of Maryland statutes.
You need to know what it said right now.
What?
Listen to me.
Everything is okay.
I've taken care of it.
What is it, Jack?
The bastard gave him your home address.
It said, "Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway,
"Captiva, Florida.
"Save yourself.
Kill them all."
Get me a plane.
Will!
Mom.
What time-
- What?
Someone's outside.
There are noises.
- Where?
- Outside.
Mom.
Go back to your room and close the door.
- Mom.
- Do it now.
Ma'am, are you all right?
What?
What is it?
What is it?
What's going on?
Ma'am, I think you should come back inside.
- What's going on?
- Come back inside.
Please.
I think you should come back inside.
I'm sorry, Molly.
I'm sorry about all of this.
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.
He's after you now, isn't he?
This is just a precaution.
Kevin, why don't you run down to the water, check out the dock?
I want to hang around here.
I'm in the kitchen, Mom.
Okay.
What is that about?
What, he's afraid to leave you alone with me now?
He saw the article in the Tattler, right?
I wanted to talk with him about it, but he said he wanted to bring it up to you, face to face.
Good for him.
Kevin, help me unpack, will you?
Then we'll go get some groceries.
You and Mom are very well-protected, you know.
No one's gonna find out where you are.
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
No.
This guy is trying to kill us?
We don't know that.
When are you going to kill him?
I'm not.
It's only my job to find him.
Barry's mom had this newspaper.
It said you were in a special hospital.
Well, it was a regular hospital, then I was transferred into the psychiatric wing.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
I don't know.
Was it because in the papers it said it was this man Lecktor?
What happened?
Well, Lecktor was attacking college girls, then he killed them.
How?
In bad ways.
He was a psychiatrist.
One of the girls was his patient, and I went to talk to him about her.
I tried to build feelings in my imagination like the killer had, so that I would know why he did what he did, because that would help me find him.
When I was sitting in Lecktor's office and I looked up, I saw a book on his shelf.
It had pictures of war wounds in it.
And I knew it was him.
So I went to a pay phone down the hall to call the police and that's when he attacked me.
You and Mom came to see me in the hospital, and that helped a lot.
But after my body got okay,
I still had his thoughts going around in my head.
And I stopped talking to people.
And a doctor friend of mine, a Dr. Bloom, asked me to get some help.
And I did.
Then after a while I felt better, and I was okay again.
And the way he thought felt that bad?
Kevin... they're the ugliest thoughts in the world.
So, what kind of coffee do you like?
You like that Folgers stuff, right?
Yeah.
Mom likes that, too.
When can we go home, Dad?
I don't know, Kevin.
So, where are things?
Nowhere.
Everything we've tried is either a dead end or it's backfired.
Crawford's already planning the next crime scene so they can get it fresh.
We've got about six more days till the next full moon.
Can you quit?
No.
What's next?
I go to Atlanta.
Crawford?
No.
I have to be alone.
You're talking about doing exactly what you said you--
This killing, it's gotta stop.
William, you're gonna make yourself sick.
Or get yourself killed.
You and Kevin should go to Montana.
See your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.
And I'll come up and get you afterwards.
Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry I can't come to the phone right now.
I'm sorry, too.
Excuse me.
Coffee.
It's just you and me now, sport.
I'm gonna find you, God damn it.
Mr. Dollarhyde?
Eileen.
Bill told me to tell you there was a variation in the gamma of number three.
But he caught it in time.
Eileen...
Good.
Good.
Who's there?
Mr. Dollarhyde.
I came about the low-light infrared emulsion.
Oh, yeah.
Come on in, it's safe.
Put your back against the door.
There's a stool just to your right.
You're the production controller from Admin, right?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions?
Shooting from maybe eight feet.
I can't use any lights.
Okay, what's being photographed?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
Four days.
Okay, let me stick this in the black hole.
1000-C infrared sensitive has to be handled in total darkness.
Remember to be very careful with it.
But still, it's easier to handle than the 1200 series.
- It'll be fine.
- In case you're wondering,
I keep the samples straight by touch code.
No, I wasn't wondering.
Reba, I gotta fly.
Maybe Mr. Dollarhyde can drive you home tonight.
No, that's okay.
I'll take care of myself.
I can change things around.
No, thanks, go on.
Okay.
I'll take you.
No, thanks.
I'll order you 1200 feet of 1000-C in the morning.
Ride with me.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus.
I do it all the time.
Ride with me.
It would be because I would like you to.
Okay, sure.
Let me get my stuff on.
How did you come to Gateway?
Oh, they had to hire the handicapped to shape up their employment practices to get this defense contract.
You worked out well.
Everybody they hired did.
You know, you speak very well.
Although you avoid fricatives and sibilants.
At the Riker Institute for the Blind,
I trained in therapy for speech- and hearing-impaired children.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
You know, if you don't want to talk, that's okay.
But I hope you will, because you're very direct, and I like that, and I like what you have to say.
May I touch your face?
I want to know whether you're smiling or frowning.
I guess I want to know whether I should be quiet or not.
Take my word for it.
I'm smiling.
I didn't mean to offend you.
On the way, can I take you somewhere?
Where?
It would be my surprise.
Okay, sure.
Are you apprehensive?
No.
The very protective Mr. Dollarhyde over there is watching us.
No, no, I want to.
In about two hours we're going to cap his tooth.
Yeah.
It's warm.
Back a little bit.
There.
You hear it?
Yeah.
You... rearrange the dead families into an audience to see what you do.
You think that what you do will make you into something different.
You are becoming.
What is it you think you're becoming?
The answer is in the way you use the mirrors.
What do the mirrors make you dream you're becoming?
A little to your left.
Francis, that was a great dinner.
Thank you.
I made you a gin and tonic.
It's right in front of you.
What are you watching?
It's just a little homework.
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, D.
Is there a fire in the sky?
Your heart's loud.
Is there a moon up there?
If you'll hold me.
Is anything alive now?
This darkness is what I hear
This is a breathless silence
A moment out of time
I see your face in the shadows
The tell-tale signs are in your eyes
Aching with a passion inside
Deep as the river
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
Is there a flame in the dark?
Is there a bright heart star?
These creatures look the same now
We freeze wherever we are
We wake alone in the blackness
We sleep wherever we fall
One dream all around us
This big hush infects us all
Forever in this half-light
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
All desire
The ashes and the fire
Turning this night inside
And the light from you
- Is that you, D?
- Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Hi.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
You know, if you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee.
No, no...
Don't go back inside the house.
Why?
I left my purse inside.
I'll get it.
It's okay.
I mean, you should stay outside, it's-
- It's...
It's 'cause you look so good in the sun.
Okay.
When...
Reba, when can I see you again?
We could meet at my house.
You got the message Lecktor called?
Yeah.
I arranged for him to have a phone.
I gotta call him in a few minutes.
Good.
Listen, we identified the tire tracks left when Lounds was delivered back to the Tattler.
G-7816 Goodyear truck tires.
Looks like our boy drives a van.
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you coming back?
When I'm done, Jack.
Yeah, this is Will Graham of the FBI.
Dr. Chilton arranged for me to talk to Dr. Lecktor.
Hello?
Hello, Will.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds.
I admire that enormously.
Oh, what a cunning boy you are.
I'm sick of you crazy sons of bitches.
You got something to say, say it.
I want to help you.
You'd be more comfortable if you relax with yourself.
We don't invent our natures, they're issued to us, along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else.
Why fight it?
Fight what?
Did you really feel so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death?
I didn't know you then, but I think you probably did.
But it wasn't the act that got you down, was it?
Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?
And why shouldn't it feel good?
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.
God's terrific.
He dropped a church roof on 34 of his worshippers last Wednesday night in Texas as they were groveling through a hymn to his majesty.
Don't you think that felt good?
Why does it feel good, Dr. Lecktor?
It feels good, Will, because God has power.
And if one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.
He got 140 Filipinos in one plane crash last month.
Remember that earthquake in Italy last spring?
I enter.
The glass cutter.
The piece of glass I take out is mine.
The house is mine.
I walk up these stairs,
I pass the children's toys.
The children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.
I move to the door.
I step into the room.
I see you there.
And I see me desired by you.
Accepted and loved... in the silver mirrors... of your eyes.
Father, look in my eyes
See me as I really am
You made me
Now take me
I'm gonna talk to Fogel tomorrow...
Tell me how it feels now
Behold your flesh has come of age
Wait a minute.
Forsake me, you break me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that scares me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that dares me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that haunts me
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that taunts me
Mother, let me heal you
Your pain has lasted far too long
Release it, it kills you
What was it?
Pollen.
- Thanks for the ride.
- See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
The love you would not share grows tired of waiting
Mr. Dollarhyde.
What are you doing here?
Strong as I am
There's something about this thing that scares me
Strong as I am
Who is it?
It's me.
Who?
Who is it?
It's me.
- Francis?
- No... not Francis.
Francis is gone.
Francis is gone forever.
So, what are we doing?
The dream.
He dreams about being wanted and desired, so he changes people into beings who want and desire him.
Changes?
It's a word.
Killing and arranging the people to imitate it.
And Lecktor told me something.
If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
You put it together, you get, if our boy imitates being wanted and desired enough times, he believes he will become one who is wanted and desired and accepted.
It'll all come true.
This started from an abused kid, a battered infant.
There's something terrible about--
What, are you sympathizing with this guy now?
Absolutely.
My heart bleeds for him as a child.
Someone took a kid and manufactured a monster.
At the same time, as an adult, he's irredeemable.
He butchers whole families to pursue trivial fantasies.
As an adult, someone should blow this sick fuck out of his socks.
Do you think that's a contradiction, Jack?
Does this kind of understanding make you uncomfortable?
What about the mirrors?
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.
But he doesn't take anything.
There's no souvenirs taken from the houses.
He needs souvenirs or trophies to re-live the event.
Maybe he records it somehow.
So he could see himself accepted over and over and over again.
VTRs, Polaroids, stills, what?
How do I know?
How does he find them?
When we find out how he found them, we'll find him.
There is no connection between the two families.
We've done a dozen computer runs.
Jack, all the women have a bloom on them.
He didn't win them in a lottery, he picked these women.
There's selection and design in his choices.
Look, admit we struck out this month.
The Lear Jet is standing by, the basic lab stuff is on it.
You, Zeller, Jimmy Price, the photographer, anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and 15 minutes.
We get the call, we roll.
The scene will be fresher than we've ever had it.
- It's not over yet.
- For Christ's sake!
That's a foregone conclusion.
It's 11:30 p.m., the full moon is happening tonight.
Give it up!
Forget this month, it's too damn late!
I gave it up.
Till you showed up with pictures of two dead families, knowing goddamn well that I'd imagine families three, four, five and six.
Right?
You're fucking right I did, and I'd do it again!
Great!
But don't talk to me about late, pal,
I'll tell you when it's too fucking late!
Until then, we go as late as I want to take it!
A padlock.
That's why the bolt cutter.
What's that?
He used a bolt cutter to trim away the branch when he was watching from the woods.
Why didn't he use the bolt cutter on the garage door?
Because a deadbolt was there when they were killed.
Donald Jacobi's 12th birthday party was April 14th.
Sometime between April 14th and August 1 they changed the lock.
But he thought there was a padlock there.
From the street, you can't see the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door.
There's a big, high fence there.
But he was ready with his glass cutter.
So either he was casing far ahead and we didn't check back far enough,
or...
We checked.
Don't talk.
Metcalfe, is the Leeds and Jacobi stuff still in the storeroom?
Have the guard down there call me.
Do it.
You know that's the Jacobis' cat.
You brought a bolt cutter 'cause you thought there was a padlock.
The Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog, don't you, my man?
See the woman?
The bloom on the woman?
You can see her again and again anytime you want.
Doggie doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog.
And the Jacobi cat.
And the padlock on the door.
And you know you need a bolt cutter and every other goddamn thing because everything with you is seeing, isn't it?
Your primary sensory intake that makes your dream live is seeing.
Reflections, mirrors, images...
You've seen these films.
Haven't you, my man?
It's the guard in the storeroom.
- The cans.
- What cans?
The tapes were transferred from home movies.
Where's the packaging the films came in?
There's films of the families in the document storage.
Find them.
You got them?
Are there any labels?
Leeds can, Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
The Jacobi label will say the same thing as the Leeds label.
Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
Who processed the Jacobi film?
No.
Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.
Stores send them out.
Have him peel the top label back.
Is there a label underneath?
It does, doesn't it?
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes to Meigs Field.
At Meigs Field,
I want the Lear Jet prepped and a plan filed with St. Louis.
Where are you?
Are you here?
You're scaring me with this!
Will you just stop it?
Francis... why are you doing this to me?
It's ugly!
Don't you know that I'll always be true?
Are you in this room?
Where are you?
You answer me!
And take my hand
Oh, won't you come with me
And walk this land
Please, take my hand
We're looking for a man.
We know he works at Gateway.
We don't have his name, but we know he drives a van.
Under "Employee Facilities,"
I've got special stickers for vans.
Yeah, I got 28, 29 van permits in the computer.
Start feeding me names.
Is this Lieutenant Fisk?
Will Graham.
Listen, I need you to punch up the driver's licenses of the names I'm gonna feed you.
The man we're looking for is blond, Caucasian, twenty to forty years old, over six feet tall, 180 to 225 pounds.

Six foot-seven, 217 pounds.

Put it through the data-fax.
Fast.
You guys better buckle up.
We're on approach to Lambert Field.
Fogel has four more names.
He knows two, both dark hair, third's a woman, fourth is a handicapped parking permit.
This is our man.
Rural Route 3, Chester, Missouri.
Where is that?
From the airport you're a few minutes closer.
We'll 10-25 at the Hark Road off ramp, Highway 94.
Let's go!
Meet point's up ahead.
Go on to the house.
But Lieutenant Fisk said--
Go on to the house.
Will?
You're not gonna need that.
A SWAT team is gonna take him down, not us.
Will?
Will!
This ought to be it right here.
Kill your lights.
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
Griffin's hurt bad.
I'll wait for the backup.
Set up a roadblock on Route 3.
Graham and I are in the trees west of the house.
How far away is the backup unit?
I'm going around the back.
Stay in the trees.
He's in there, Jack.
And he's got somebody in there with him.
What?
Will, what did you say?
Will.
Wait for the backup, Will.
He's got somebody in the house with him, Jack.
Will.
Stop it.
Stop it!
Three, four...
In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey
Don't you know that I love you?
In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby
Don't you know that I'll always be true?
Oh, won't you come with me
And take my hand
Oh, won't you come with me
And walk this land
Please, take my hand
It's okay.
Who are you?
Graham.
I'm Will Graham.
I can hear your heartbeat knocking on the window
Hey, Dad!
I can feel the weight deep down below
- Dad!
- Hey!
It looks worse than it is, pal.
See the turtles?
Hi.
It was on the news.
I thought I had to work things out and call you after.
I thought I wouldn't wait.
Sometimes I understand it very clearly
Heartbeat, heartbeat Listen to my heartbeat
How many of them made it?
Most of them.
Most of them made it.
Heartbeat Listen to my heartbeat
I can hear your tiptoe
I can hear the door close
Anticipation in me grows
I can feel your dark eyes
Touch me in the darkness
Understand the message never sent
Sometimes I

We should've talked at the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk about it here.
I'm not fallin' all over myself to talk about it much anywhere, Jack.
- How much do you know?
- Not much.
The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago.
The second one in Atlanta was all over TV.
- You ever think about givin' me a call?
- No.
- Why not?
- I quit, remember?
You look all right now.
I am.
All right.
If you can't look any more, I understand.
Don't try to run a game down on me, Jack.
If I really didn't need you to come back, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks and a few days until the next full moon.
We have a better chance to get him fast if you help.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
Hi, Molly.
- Think it'll keep 'em out, Dad?
- Yep.
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
In this hatchery?
Just 40 or 50 of 'em.
- Crabs get most of the newborns, huh?
- Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it.
Guaranteed.
What about the dogs?
Are they gonna get in?
No - they can't dig under, you see.
That's why we bury the wire down in the sand.
I need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be his friend, Jack.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, Molly, I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.
- We got it pretty good, don't we?
- We have it more than good.
All that happened to you before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only look at evidence.
I wouldn't get deeply involved.
He'd never even see me or know my name.
If they find him, they'll have to take him down, not me.
What do you think?
I think you've already decided and you're not really asking.
If I were asking...
Stay here with me.
Me and Kevin.
But that's selfish, and I know it.
Come here.
I'll come inside with you if you want, to show you around.
Mr Crawford said you may wanna be alone...
That's right.
There's a VCR hooked up in your hotel room.
They transferred some home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen sliding door.
Used a glass cutter anchored to a suction cup.
His entry was skilful.
All the prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair.
Strong.
Size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood AB positive, typed from saliva on glass from licking the suction cup.
Why didn't he care that he left saliva on the glass?
It was hot out that night.
So inside the house must have felt cool to him.
The intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he was rising, then shot Mrs Leeds.
The bullet lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation.
Elevation of serotonin and increase of free histamine level in gunshot wound indicates she lived at least five minutes after she was shot.
All her other injuries were postmortem.
The direction and velocity of bloodstains on east wall indicate arterial spray.
Even with his throat cut, Leeds fought, because the intruder was moving to the children's room.
Bloodstains on west wall of master bedroom and sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained,
as does superficial ligature mark around Mr Leeds' chest, also believed to be postmortem.
What'd the killer do with them after they were dead?
Hi.
This is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry I can't come to the phone right now, but if you'd like to leave a message, please do so and I'll call you back as soon as I can.
29th floor.
Going up.
When they were dead, he smashed the mirrors and began selecting pieces that he would use later on Mrs Leeds.
Killing Mr Leeds and the children would take less than a minute.
Mrs Leeds' injuries were postmortem.
Four or five minutes later.
What did he do in the interval?
Smeared bloodstains on the west wall.
Uh...
- Hello?
- Molly?
- Will, is that you?
- Yeah, it's me, honey.
Look, uh...
I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.
What are you dreaming?
That's somethin' you can't afford for me to know about, isn't it?
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
It was maddening to have to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg.
But there wasn't any talcum powder in the bathroom.
The talcum powder came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you?
You son of a bitch, you touched her with your bare hands!
And then you put your gloves back on.
But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so that they could see you?
- Crawford.
- Jack.
This is Graham.
Is Price still in Latent Prints?
Yeah.
He's in charge of the single print index now.
- What do you got, Will?
- Get him to Atlanta.
Atlanta PD say they dusted everything.
Their guy's good.
- He is, but not as good as Price.
- I'll get him on a plane tomorrow.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs Leeds' finger- and toenails, and the corneas of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves, Jack.
Our people swear he wore surgeon's gloves the whole time.
They dusted everything.
Your report didn't mention eyes.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
Because Mrs Leeds was a beautiful woman.
This is what the subject's teeth look like.
The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed these from the impressions of the bite marks on the Leeds woman here and the Jacobi woman in Birmingham last month.
As you can see, he has pegged lateral incisors.
That's these teeth here and here.
Vice and Narcotics, you take the KY cowboys and the leather bars.
Marcus, Whitman, the funeral.
The rest of you, assignments are on the sheet.
Uh, one more thing.
I've heard officers referring' to this killer as the "Tooth Fairy".
I don't wanna hear that in public.
And I don't wanna see it in internal memoranda.
That's it.
I know a burglar's gonna fence what he stole, cos his motive is cash money.
I know his motive, so I go to work on fences.
This guy, we don't even have motive.
None of us have shit, and we know it.
It's in his dreams.
- His motive?
- Yeah.
His act fuels his fantasy.
- Which is?
- I don't know.
The commissioner was saying that you're the one who got Garrett Jacob Hobbes, and then Dr Lecktor three years ago.
- Lecktor killed nine people, didn't he?
- Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
- What happened to them?
- One's on a respirator, in Baltimore, one's in a Denver mental hospital.
What'd the psychologist say was wrong with Lecktor?
The psychologists call him a psychopath.
They don't know what else to call him.
I understand he cut you pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's.
The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen.
- The Jacobis in Birmingham had a cat?
- That's right.
We found the litter box downstairs but we didn't find the cat.
Why not get Birmingham PD a methane probe out of Washington?
Have 'em cover the back yard.
Maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
- Yeah?
- This is Jimmy Price, FBI.
- Let me put you on speakerphone.
- Who am I talking to?
Jack Crawford.
Will Graham's here too.
I got a partial print with a tented arch.
It's probably a thumb.
And the fragment of a palm off the nail of Mrs Leeds' left big toe.
The thumbprint came off the oldest kid's left eye.
It stood out on a haemorrhage from the gunshot wound.
- Can we make an identification off of it?
- Maybe.
If he's ever been printed and he's in my index.
I wanna work these up in my darkroom.
I'll fax the prints to you this afternoon.
Thanks, Jimmy.
No comment.
We get lucky with that print, we're in.
If Jimmy can find him in the index,
- and if he's ever been printed.
- Will Graham!
Remember me?
Freddie Lounds.
Covered the Lecktor case for the Tattler, did the paperback.
So, Will, when did they call you in?
I'm buyin' lunch.
- Lounds, give it a rest.
- Hey, he's news.
I'm doin' my job.
How does he compare with Lecktor?
What does he do to 'em?
How's he do 'em?
How's he do 'em, Will?
- Keep the fuck away from me.
- Will.
Will!
He snuck in while I was sedated after Lecktor.
He pulled back the sheets and took pictures.
- Yeah, I know.
- Look, don't expect too much from me.
We only got three weeks.
You're our best shot.
You think I'll see him in the street and say "There he is"?
That's Houdini you're thinkin' about.
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on until we get smart or we get lucky.
He won't stop.
- Why?
- He's got a genuine taste for it.
You do know somethin' about him.
Not enough.
I think I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mind-set.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Yeah, I keep getting it for Christmas.
- Did you get my card?
- I got it.
Thank you.
And how is Officer Stuart?
The one who was first to see my basement.
- Stuart's fine.
- Emotional problems, I hear.
- Do you have any problems, Will?
- No.
No.
Of course you don't.
I'm glad you came.
My callers are mostly clinical psychologists from cornfed universities somewhere.
Second-raters, the lot.
Dr Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction.
- And?
- Very interesting.
Even to a layman.
I want you to help me, Dr Lecktor.
Yes.
I thought so.
- It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
- Yes?
- You read about it?
- In the papers.
I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
- I thought you'd have ideas.
- Why should I tell you?
You'd get to see the file on this case.
- And there's another reason.
- Pray tell.
I thought you'd want to see if you're smarter than him.
You think you're smarter than me, since you caught me.
No.
I know that I'm not smarter than you.
- How did you catch me?
- You had disadvantages.
- What disadvantages?
- You're insane.
You're very tan, Will.
Your hands are rough.
They don't look like cop's hands any more.
That shaving lotion's what a child would select.
It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it?
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
I don't think I'll persuade you at all.
You'll either do it or you won't.
Besides, we have Dr Bloom working on it.
He's the best.
- Do you have the file with you?
Pictures?
- Yes.
- Let me have them and I may consider it.
- No.
- Dream much, Will?
- Goodbye, Dr Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file, and I'll tell you what I think.
This is a very shy boy, Will.
- What were the yards like?
- Big back yards.
Fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, my dear Will, if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he might go outside to look at it.
Have you ever seen blood in the moonlight, Will?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy for this sort of thing.
- That's interesting.
- No, it's not.
You thought of it before.
- I considered it.
- You came here to look at me.
- To get the old scent back again.
- I want your opinion.
- I don't have one right now.
- When you have one, I'd like to hear it.
- Can I keep this?
- I haven't decided yet.
I'll study them.
When you get more files, I'd like to see them too.
You can call me.
When I call my lawyer they bring a phone.
Would you like to leave me your home phone number?
- No.
- Do you know how you caught me, Will?
- Call the number on the file.
- Do you know how you caught me?
The reason you caught me, Will, is we're just alike.
You want the scent?
Smell yourself.
Gotcha.
Get up by the bunk.
Face the wall.
Don't turn around or I'll Mace you in the face.
Thank you so much.
I'll call you when I'm finished.
- Are you ready for your call?
- Yes.
Thank you.
Paltrow, Christiansen and Golub law offices.
Excuse me, I must have misdialled.
Thank you for using AT T. This is operator 24.
Operator.
Er...
I don't have the use of my arms.
Er, would you be so kind as to, er, dial a number for me, please?
- Certainly.
What's the number?
- Area code 301-555-6624.
University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry.
- Dr Sidney Bloom, please.
- He's not in.
I'll connect you to his office.
- What's his secretary's name again?
- Martha King.
Just a moment, please.
- Martha King's desk.
- Hi.
Martha.
- Martha doesn't come in nights.
- Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob Greer of Blain and Edwards Publishing.
Dr Bloom asked me to send a copy of The Psychiatrist and the Law to someone.
- Martha never sent me the address.
- She'll be in in the morning.
Well, I've gotta catch Federal Express in about five minutes.
I'd be appreciative if you could pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
- I don't see a Rolodex.
- I bet she has a Call Caddy by her phone.
Yeah.
Zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
All right.
The name we're looking for...
Last name Graham.
The man the book is supposed to be sent to.
A Mr Will Graham.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, 10th and Pennsylvania, Washington, DC.
Now, I'll bet it has his home address there too.
3680 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida.
Thank you... so very much.
I've finished.
- Mommy!
- Oh, my gosh.
It's all right.
Stewardess!
Ladies and gentlemen, we are beginning' our descent into Birmingham.
You used a cutting tool on the branch so that you could see.
And you passed the time whittling.
And dreaming.
When night came, you saw them pass by their bright windows, you watched the shades go down,
and you saw the lights go out one by one.
And after a while you climbed down and you went in to 'em, didn't you?
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?
You watched them all goddamn day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
I need Firearms and Toolmarks here on a branch.
I need to know what tool he used.
Then I need Bowman in Documents on this carving.
- Is it weird?
- The mark?
Yeah.
If Documents can't do it, I'll send it to Langley.
- Did Price identify the Leeds print?
- No.
He hasn't found him in the index.
It's a hand search.
He's got half his department on it.
Listen, Will, have you seen this week's Tattler?
- It's not on my preferred reading list.
- Yeah, well, uh...
Your picture's all over the front page.
- Who the hell was it?
Lounds?
- Yes.
Who else?
Goddamn it, Jack!
I promised Molly!
I promised her!
- Come in.
- Dr Chilton?
- Yes.
- We were cleaning out Dr Lecktor's cell.
He heard us coming and hid something in a book.
We got him out and dug around.
- Is that it?
- Yes.
Put it down on my desk.
- Has anyone else seen this except you?
- No.
- Special Agent Crawford's office.
- This is Dr Chilton.
- I need to speak to Mr Graham.
- He's in Birmingham.
Agent Crawford is on the line with him.
Will you please tell them this is very, very urgent?
I'll hold on.
Dr Chilton, it's Crawford.
Will Graham's on the line too.
I have a note, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from that man
- who killed those people in Atlanta.
- Where did you get it?
In Hannibal Lecktor's cell, hidden in a book.
Don't touch the note.
Can you read it to us?
It's written on toilet tissue.
"My dear Dr Lecktor,
I wanted to tell you I am delighted that you've taken an interest in me."
"I know that you alone can understand what I am Becoming. "
"You alone know the people I use to help me in these things are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am Becoming, just as the source of light is burning."
"I have a collection of your press clippings."
"I think they are absurd, as are mine."
"The 'Tooth Fairy'.
What could be more inappropriate?"
"Investigator Graham interests me.
Very purposeful looking."
"I hope we can correspond."
Mr Graham, there's a piece missing here.
Now I'll read the bottom part.
"After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet."
Signed "Avid Fan".
It has teeth marks pressed into it at the bottom.
Sarah, order a chopper.
I don't care whose it is.
Call Alabama Air National Guard and tell 'em to get Graham back here now.
Tell Documents to scramble a team.
I want everybody moving' five minutes ago.
I have a Documents team on its way by helicopter to pick up the note.
After we work the note, replace it in Lecktor's cell.
I don't want Lecktor to know we found it.
He might try to warn the killer.
- Where's Lecktor now?
- Holding cell.
- How long can you keep him there?
- Three, four hours.
Brian, we have a note coming in, possibly from the Tooth Fairy, number one priority.
It must go to Hair and Fibre, Latent Prints and Documents.
Graham and I'll take it.
One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.
- A couple of blue grains.
- Work the hair.
- What we got for negative comparison?
- Hair from Lecktor's comb.
Whiskers from the electric razor they let him use.
Hair from the security guard.
- How many handled this without gloves?
- Guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.
Cleanup man, scrubbing sinks.
Probably had the oil washed off his fingers.
But the others...
One smudge.
Those aren't ridges.
It's just the texture of the paper.
I can fume for a print, but can't say the iodine stains'd fade out.
- Ninhydrin?
Boost it with heat?
- No, we couldn't wash it after.
I can't get a print off this in the time you've got to get it back.
- How long do I have?
- 20 minutes, max.
The main thing to find out is, how is Lecktor supposed to reply to him?
Which is probably the missing section.
It says "I hope we can correspond."
Then comes the gap.
This note was written in ballpoint.
It looks like Lecktor went over this area with a felt-tip pen, then tore it away.
You're so sly, but so am I.
The aniline dyes used in the ink of felt-tip pens like Lecktor used are transparent to infrared.
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.
Looks like the tip of a T here, here, and here.
- At the end could be the top of an R.
- There's three Ts and an R in "Tattler".
Our boy reads it.
The article about me and Lecktor.
I don't know anybody else that carried that.
Personal ads.
We believe the Tooth Fairy told Lecktor to reply to him through the personal ads section of the National Tattler.
The Chicago office is down there running through their ads.
We have cut into a line of communication between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor.
If we find Lecktor's reply, we plan to pull it, substitute it with one of our own.
This is what the Tooth Fairy will read.
Bill?
"Dear Avid Fan.
Inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements."
"Mementoes for you at Baltimore Central, left luggage."
"Ticket number 72683."
It's a Secret Service letter drop.
We'll stake it out.
When he shows, we grab him.
- Anything from Chicago?
- Not yet.
- When do they go to press?
- 35 minutes.
- Christ.
- Let's get to the physical.
- There was no print.
- Scale counts and core size of the hair matched the blond hair found in the Jacobis'.
That note was written by your man.
Aside from the hair, three blue grains, dark flecks - went to Brian's end.
The grains are commercial cleanser, with chlorine from the cleaner.
Particles of dried blood, but not enough to type.
- This is Chester.
Who am I talking to?
- Will Graham, Jack Crawford.
I got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in it being telexed to you right now.
- Read it.
- "Dear Avid Fan, you honour me."
- "You're very beautiful."
- Oh, Christ.
"I offer 100 prayers for your safety."
"Find help in Galatians 6:11, 15:2,
Acts 3:3, Revelations 18:7,
Jonah 6:8, John 6:22, Luke 1:7. "
Thanks.
Jimmy.
Did you get anywhere identifying him off the Leeds prints?
Not yet.
- Cryptography at Langley?
- They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.
No.
And our ad has to go out in the same book code Lecktor used,
- or he'll know it wasn't Lecktor.
- Book code?
"100 prayers" could be page, the paired numbers, line and letter.
But what book?
- The Bible?
- No.
Galatians 15:2...
Galatians only has six chapters.
Same with Jonah 6:8.
Jonah has four chapters.
Lecktor was not using The Bible.
He probably named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
Right.
What about sweating' Lecktor?
They tried sodium amytal to find where he buried a Princeton student.
- He gave 'em a recipe for potato-chip dip.
- Wonderful.
The Tooth Fairy would've named a book he knew Lecktor has access to.
- He'd know from articles.
- When Willingham tossed the cell, he took Polaroids so he could put it all back.
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books.
- Where?
- Library of Congress.
25 minutes.
He won't make it in time.
Lecktor's ad runs as is, we decode it later.
Or we pull it, figure out the code
- and run our own ad next week.
- And lose a week?
We got 17 days...
And I don't like Lecktor's ad running without knowing what it says.
But it's your call, Will.
Run it.
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something else beside write?
We'll all feel sick for a very long time.
And if Bowman still can't figure it out?
We bait him with something in next week's Tattler.
What, for instance?
Me.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
Why not?
Don't you think we can provoke him?
Maybe.
Maybe he can be provoked.
What I was thinkin' about is you.
You're gettin' deeper and deeper into this.
Sidney.
Last time you did that you did a real good job of pushing yourself all out of shape.
You try it on again or you go through some big trauma, you could relapse.
Sidney, don't worry about me.
I'm workin' the evidence.
Makin' moves.
That's all.
I'm fine.
Bowman just struck out.
It is not books in Lecktor's cell.
- Price?
- He just heard it's a bust-out.
As evidence, the Leeds print will get us a conviction, if we could find the guy.
But he must never have been printed, because he is not in our index.
We are not going to identify him off the print.
- I'll use Lounds.
- What for?
Boy doesn't read The New York Times.
He reads Lounds in the Tattler.
- What else shall we cover?
- He put the shorts on Leeds after he died.
I believe he did this to make sure we wouldn't think he was gay.
He's molested all of his male victims.
He may be impotent with members of the opposite sex.
Our forensic psychologists have projected, though I'm not sure, that he may have had sexual relations with his mother.
- How long will you stay in Washington?
- Until we've taken out the Tooth Fairy.
- Can the Tattler get it straight from you?
- Absolutely.
How does working' on this case affect your sex life?
Mine?
It doesn't affect mine, it affects yours.
Go fuck yourself.
- Look, pal of mine, you're news.
- Pictures.
All right, let's shoot him.
I'm in the shots with Graham.
- What?
- I'm in the shots with you.
Come on!
You want this to look real or not?
Make sure the theatre sign across the street is just out of focus.
We want him to find it, but we don't wanna be obvious.
Make sure that I look excellent.
All right, shoot.
One more.
One more.
- That's enough.
- OK, Graham.
Hey, always nice, huh?
Let's have lunch.
Call my service.
Crawford, always a thrill.
Dr Bloom.
I need them on my desk in two hours, OK?
- Did Bowman break the code yet?
- No.
Tools and Firearms say the cutting tool used on the branch was a common bolt-cutter.
I got a call from Asian Studies at Langley.
The mark you found on the tree?
- Yeah?
- It's a Chinese character, considered a lucky sign in gambling.
The same character appears on a mahjong piece.
It means "red dragon".
Mean anything to you?
No.
If he shows, and he's smart, he'll approach you from the front, pass, turn, try and take you from behind.
- How's your hearing?
- It's good.
You'll wear a wire, one way.
We'll hear you, you won't hear us.
- You checked out a.44 Special Bulldog?
- Yeah.
- Load these in it.
- Glaser safety slugs.
Yeah.
Number 12 shots suspended in liquid Teflon in a copper casing.
On impact, it all opens up in the target.
Guaranteed one-shot stop.
You got body armour?
- Yeah, Kevlar Second Chance.
- I hope you get one.
Cos he's gone for the head shot eight out of 11 times?
Let's walk the route.
United flight 849 to Newark is now boarding at gate seven.
United flight 849 to Newark is now boarding at gate seven.
Someone's comin'.
Go!
Don't!
Don't move.
- Take the money!
- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!
- Clear!
Clear!
What you movin' in slow motion for, man?
I'm bein' mugged!
Can you believe that?
WAB Chicago.
In sports, the Cubs lost again, and...
Hey!
Do you know who I am?
I don't wanna know who you are.
According to you, I'm a sexual pervert.
An animal, you said.
You know who I am now?
Yes.
Do you feel privileged?
I'm very scared.
Open your eyes.
Mr Lounds, you're a reporter.
Your job is to report.
That's why you're here.
If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Well?
Here I... am.
Look at the screen.
William Blake's The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in the Rays of the Sun.
- Do you see?
- Yes.
- Mrs Leeds.
Do you see?
- Yes.
- Mrs Jacobi.
Do you see?
- Yes.
The next family as they will look when I go to visit them.
Do you see?
Yes.
Mrs Leeds, later.
Her husband beside her.
Yes.
Mrs Jacobi, after her changing.
The Dragon rampant.
Freddie Lounds.
Your photograph.
No.
- No what?
- No.
Not me, please.
- Please.
- Are you a man?
Yes.
Do you imply that I am queer?
God, no!
Before me, you are a slug in the sun.
You are privy to a great...
Becoming, and you recognise nothing.
You are an ant in the afterbirth.
It is your nature to do one thing correctly.
Tremble.
But fear is not what you owe me.
No, Lounds.
You and the others, you owe me awe!
We have one more piece of work to do.
If he takes off the mask I am a dead man.
Open your eyes.
- Open your eyes!
- Aah!
You will read this into the tape recorder.
- Go.
- "I have had a great privilege."
"I have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the Red Dragon."
"All I wrote about him were lies."
"Will Graham made me write them to pull him into a trap in Washington, District of Columbia."
"Will Graham, you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread because I was forced to lie."
"He will be more merciful to me than to you."
"You will lie awake in fear of what the Red Dragon will do."
"I will be a testament to the truth of this."
You did very well.
Will you let me go now?
Please?
You will tell the truth?
I promise.
Good.
We'll seal your promise with...
We'll seal your promise... with a kiss.
... five possible answers.
Any member of a team may buzz in, but if incorrect, the other team will have the opportunity to answer.
The team with the most points at the end will win...
Hear that?
That means a round is over.
So, Jane, we're all ready for round one.
All right, Bob.
The first category today is the Far East.
And the choices are Vietnam, Japan, Laos, Thailand and China.
Category and possible answers.
Every question's worth ten points, and I can only accept the answer of the person who buzzes in...
Bowman, just get to Cryptography and tell me what the hell it says, OK?
- Did he try to say anything at all?
- No, he sure didn't.
He never woke up.
Did you hear the tape?
Yeah.
Bowman broke the code that Lecktor used in the Tattler personal ad.
It was the State of Maryland Statutes.
You need to know what it said now.
- What?
- Listen to me.
Everything is OK.
I've taken care of it.
- What is it, Jack?
- The bastard gave him your address.
It said "Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Captiva, Florida."
- "Save yourself, kill them all."
- Get me a plane.
Will!
Will.
Will.
Mom.
Huh?
What... what?
Someone's outside.
There are noises.
- Where?
- Outside.
Go back to your room and close the door.
Do it!
Now!
- Ma'am?
Are you all right?
- What?
What is it?
What is it?
What's going on?
- You should come back inside.
- What's going on?
- Come back inside.
- What's...
I think you should come back inside.
I'm sorry, Molly.
I'm sorry about all of this.
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.
- He's after you now, isn't he?
- It's just a precaution.
Kevin, why don't you run down to the water, check out the dock?
I wanna hang around here.
I'm in the kitchen, Mom.
OK.
What is that about?
What, he's afraid to leave you alone with me now?
- He saw the article in the Tattler, right?
- I wanted to talk with him, but he said he wanted to bring it up to you, face to face.
Good for him.
Kevin, come on.
Help me unpack, will you?
Then we'll go get some groceries.
You and Mom are very well protected.
No one's gonna find out where you are.
Is there anything I need to know?
To see about Mom?
- No.
- This guy's trying to kill us?
- We don't know that.
- When are you going to kill him?
I'm not.
It's only my job to find him.
Barry's mom had this newspaper.
It said you were in a special hospital.
Well, it was a regular hospital.
Then I was transferred into the psychiatric wing.
That bothers you, doesn't it?
I don't know.
Was it because... in the papers it said it was this man Lecktor?
- Mm-hm.
- What happened?
Well, Lecktor was attacking college girls, and he killed them.
How?
In bad ways.
He was a psychiatrist.
One of the girls was his patient, and I went to talk to him about her.
I tried to build feelings in my imagination like the killer had, so that I would know why he did what he did, because that would help me find him.
When I was sitting in Lecktor's office, and I looked up, I saw a book on his shelf.
It had pictures of war wounds in it.
Then I knew it was him.
So I went to a payphone down the hall to call the police.
And that's when he attacked me.
You and Mom came to see me in the hospital, and that helped a lot.
But after my body got OK, I still had his thoughts going around in my head.
And I stopped talking to people.
And a doctor friend of mine, a Dr Bloom, asked me to get some help.
And I did.
And after a while, I felt better, and I was OK again.
And the way he thought felt that bad?
Kevin, they're the ugliest thoughts in the world.
So what kind of coffee do you like?
- Huh?
- You like that Folgers stuff, right?
Yeah.
Mom likes that too.
When can we go home, Dad?
I don't know, Kevin.
- So where are things?
- Nowhere.
Everything we've tried is either a dead end or it's backfired.
Crawford's already planning the next crime scene so we can get it fresh.
We got about six more days till the next full moon.
Can you quit?
No.
What's next?
- I go to Atlanta.
- Crawford?
No.
I have to be... alone.
- It's exactly what you said you wouldn't...
- This killing.
It's got to stop.
William, you're gonna make yourself sick.
Or get yourself killed.
You and Kevin should go to Montana.
See your dad.
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.
And I'll come up and get you afterwards.
Hi.
This is Valerie Leeds.
Sorry I can't come to the phone right now.
- I'm sorry, too.
- Excuse me?
Coffee.
Just you and me now, sport.
I'm gonna find you, goddamn it.
- Mr Dollarhyde.
- Ah, Eileen.
Bill told me to tell you there was a variation in the gamma of number three.
- Oh.
- But he caught it in time.
Eileen...
Good.
Good.
Who's there?
Mr Dollarhyde.
I came about the low-light infrared emulsion.
Oh, yeah.
Come on in.
It's safe.
Put your back against the door.
There's a stool just to your right.
You're the production controller, right?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions?
I'm shooting from maybe eight feet.
- I...
I can't use any lights.
- OK.
What's being photographed?
- The activities of nocturnal animals.
- When do you need it?
- Four days.
- OK.
Let me stick these in a black bag.
1000C infrared sensitive has to be handled in total darkness.
Remember to be very careful with it, but it's easier to handle than the 1200 series.
It'll be fine.
In case you're wondering, I keep the samples straight by touch code.
I...
I wasn't wondering.
Reba, I gotta fly.
Maybe Mr Dollarhyde can drive you home?
No, that's OK.
I'll take care of myself.
No, thanks.
OK.
- I'll... take you.
- No, thanks.
I'll order you 1200 feet of 1000C in the morning.
- Ride with me.
- Thanks, but I'll take the bus.
Ride with me.
It would be because I would like you to.
OK.
Sure.
Let me get my stuff on.
How did you come to Gateway?
They had to hire the handicapped to shape up their employment practices to get this defence contract.
- But you worked out well.
- Yeah.
Everybody they hired did.
You know, you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants.
At the Institute for the Blind I trained in therapy for speech- and hearing-impaired children.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Uh-huh.
If you don't wanna talk, that's OK.
But I hope you will, because you're very direct, and I like that, and I like what you have to say.
May I touch your face?
I wanna know whether you're smiling or frowning.
I guess I wanna know whether I should be quiet or not.
Take my word for it.
I'm smiling.
I...
I didn't mean to offend you.
- On the way, can I take you somewhere?
- Where?
- It would be my surprise.
- OK, sure.
- Are you apprehensive?
- No.
You're very protected.
Mr Dollarhyde is watching us.
No, no.
I want to.
In about two hours, we're going to cap his tooth.
Yeah.
It's warm?
Back a little bit.
There.
- You hear it?
- Yes.
You... rearrange the dead families into an audience to see what you do.
You think that what you do will make you into something different.
You are "Becoming".
What is it you think you're becoming?
The answer's in the way you use the mirrors.
What do the mirrors make you dream you're becoming?
A little to your left.
Francis, that was a great dinner.
Thank you.
Uh...
I made you a gin and tonic.
It's right in front of you.
What are you watching?
Just a little homework.
Sweet, thoughtful man, D.
# Is there a fire in the sky?
That's allowed...
# Is there a moon up there?
...if you hold me.
# Is anything alive now?
# This darkness is what I hear
# This is a breathless silence
# A moment out of time
# I see your face in the shadows, the telltale signs are in your eyes
# Aching with a passion inside
# Deep as the river
# All desire
# The ashes and the fire
# Turning this night inside
# And the light from you
# Is there a flame in the dark?
# Is there a bright hot star?
# These creatures look the same now
# We freeze wherever we are
# We wake alone in the blackness
# We sleep wherever we fall
# One dream all around us
# This big hush infects us all
# Forever in this half-light
# All desire
# The ashes and the fire
# Turning this night inside
# And the light from you
# All desire
# The ashes and the fire
# Turning this night inside
# And the light from you
- That you, D?
- Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Fine.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Show me where things are, I'll make coffee.
No, no.
- Don't go back inside the house.
- Why?
I left my purse inside.
I'll get it.
It's OK.
I mean...
I mean... you should stay outside.
It's... it's...
It's cos you look so good in the sun.
OK.
OK.
Um...
When, uh...
Reba, when can I see you again?
Oh.
Um...
Yeah, we can meet at my house.
- Lecktor called.
- I arranged for him to have a phone.
- I gotta call him in a minute.
- We identified the tyre tracks left when Lounds was delivered to the "Tattler".
G 7816 Goodyear truck tyres.
Looks like our boy drives a van.
I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you comin' back?
When I'm done, Jack.
This is Will Graham of the FBI.
Dr Chilton arranged for me to talk to Dr Lecktor.
Hello?
Hello, Will.
I wanna congratulate you for the job you did on Mr Lounds.
I admire that enormously.
Oh, what a cunning boy you are.
I'm sick of you crazy sons of bitches, Lecktor.
You got somethin' to say, say it.
I wanna help you.
You'll be more comfortable if you relax.
We don't invent our natures.
They're issued to us along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else.
- Why fight it?
- Fight what?
Did you really feel so depressed after you shot Mr Garrett Jacob Hobbes?
I didn't know you then, but I think you probably did.
But it wasn't the act that got you down, was it?
Didn't you feel so bad because killing him felt so good?
And why shouldn't it feel good?
It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.
God's terrific.
He dropped a church roof on 34 of his worshippers last Wednesday in Texas, as they were grovelling through a hymn to his majesty.
Don't you think that felt good?
Why does it feel good, Dr Lecktor?
It feels good, Will, because God has power.
And if one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is.
God's a champ.
He always stays ahead.
He got 140 Filipinos in one plane crash last month.
Remember that earthquake in Italy last spring?
I enter.
The glass cutter.
The piece of glass I take out is mine.
The house is mine.
I walk up these stairs.
I pass the children's toys.
The children mean nothing to me.
They were put here to help me.
I move to the door.
I step into the room.
I see you there.
And I see me desired by you, accepted, and loved,
in the silver mirrors of your eyes.
# Father, look in my eyes
# See me as I really am
# You made me
# Now take me
I wanna talk to Fogle tomorrow.
# Tell me how it feels now
# Behold your flesh has come of age
Wait a minute.
# You break me
# Strong as I am
# There's something about this thing that scares me
# Strong as I am
# There's something about this thing that dares me
# Strong as I am
# There's something about this thing that haunts me
# Strong as I am
# There's something about this thing that taunts me
# Mother, let me heal you
# Your pain has lasted far too long
# Release it
# It kills you
- What was it?
- Pollen.
- Oh.
Thanks for the ride.
- See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
# The love you would not share
Mr Dollarhyde.
What are you doin' here?
# Strong as I am
# There's something about this thing that scares me
# Strong as I am
- Who is it?
- It's me.
- Who?
Who is it?
- It's me.
- Francis?
- No.
Not Francis.
Francis is gone.
Francis is gone for ever.
So what are we doin'?
The dream.
He dreams about being wanted and desired.
So he changes people into beings who want and desire him.
- Changes?
- It's a word.
Killing and arranging the people to imitate it.
And Lecktor told me something.
"If one does what God does enough times, one will become as God is."
You put it together, you get...
If our boy imitates being wanted and desired enough times, he believes he will become one who is wanted and desired and accepted.
It'll all come true.
This started from an abused kid.
A battered infant.
There's somethin' terrible about...
Are you sympathising with this guy now?
Absolutely.
My heart bleeds for him as a child.
Someone took a kid, and manufactured a monster.
At the same time, as an adult, he's irredeemable.
He butchers whole families to pursue trivial fantasies.
As an adult, someone should blow the sick fuck out of his socks.
Do you think that's a contradiction, Jack?
Does this kind of understanding make you uncomfortable?
What about the mirrors?
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.
But he doesn't take anything.
There's no souvenirs taken from the houses.
He needs souvenirs or trophies to relive the event.
Maybe he records it somehow.
So he could see himself accepted, over and over and over again.
VTRs?
Polaroids?
Stills?
What?
How do I know?
How does he find 'em?
We find out how he found them, we'll find him.
There is no connection between the two families.
- We've done a dozen computer runs.
- All the women have a bloom on them.
He didn't win them in a lottery.
He picked them.
There's selection and design in his choices.
Look.
Admit we struck out this month.
The Learjet is standing by.
The basic lab stuff is on it.
You, Zeller, Jimmy Price, the photographer.
Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour.
We get the call, we roll.
- The scene'll be fresh.
- It's not over yet.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
It's a foregone conclusion.
It's 11.30pm. The full moon is happening tonight.
Give it up!
Forget this month.
It's too late.
I gave it up.
Till you showed up with pictures of two dead families, knowing damn well that I'd imagine families three, four, five and six.
- You're fuckin' right!
I'd do it again!
- Great!
But don't talk to me about late!
I'll tell you when it's too fuckin' late!
Until then, we go as late as I wanna take it!
A padlock.
- That's why the bolt-cutter.
- What's that?
He used a bolt-cutter to trim the branch when he watched from the woods.
Why didn't he use it on the garage door?
Because a deadbolt was there when they were killed.
Donald Jacobi's 12th birthday party was April 14th.
Some time between April 14th and August 1, they changed the lock.
But he thought there was a padlock there.
From the street, you can't see the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door.
There's a big high fence there.
But he was ready with his glass-cutter.
So either he was casing far ahead, and we didn't check back far enough, or...
We checked.
Metcalf, it's Graham.
Is the Leeds and Jacobi stuff still in the storeroom?
Have the guard down there call me.
Do it.
You know that's the Jacobis' cat.
You brought a bolt-cutter cos you thought there was a padlock.
The Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar but you know it's theirs, don't you?
See the woman?
The bloom on the woman?
You can see her again and again, any time you want.
Doggy doesn't have a collar, but you know it's the Leeds' dog.
And the Jacobi cat.
And the padlock on the door.
And you know you need a bolt-cutter and every other goddamn thing.
Cos everything with you is seeing, isn't it?
Your primary sensory intake that makes your dream live is seeing.
Reflections.
Mirrors.
Images.
You've seen these films.
Haven't you, my man?
It's the guard in the storeroom.
- The cans.
- What cans?
The tapes were from home movies.
Where's the films' packaging?
There's films of the families in the document storage.
Find 'em.
You got 'em?
Are there any labels?
Leeds can, Gateway Lab, St Louis, Missouri.
The Jacobi label will say the same thing as the Leeds label.
Gateway Lab, St Louis, Missouri.
Who processed the Jacobi film?
No.
Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.
Stores send them out.
Have him peel the top label back.
Is there a label underneath?
It does, doesn't it?
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes to Meigs Field.
At Meigs Field, I want the Learjet prepped and a plan filed to St Louis.
Where are you?
Are you here?
You're scaring me with this.
Will you just stop it?
Francis!
Why are you doing this to me?
It's ugly!
Are you in this room?
Where are you?
You answer me!
# And take my hand
# Oh, won't you come with me
# And walk this land?
# Please take my hand
We're lookin' for a man.
We know he works at Gateway.
We don't have his name, but we know he drives a van.
Under Employee Facilities, I got special stickers for vans.
Uh, yeah, I got 28, 29 van permits in the computer.
Start feeding' me names.
Is this Lieutenant Fisk?
Will Graham.
I need you to punch up the driver's licences of the names I'll feed you.
The man we're lookin' for is blond, Caucasian, 20-40 years old, over six feet tall, 180 to 225 pounds.
- First name.
- Alvaro.
A-l-v-a-r-o.
First name Joseph.
Alvaro.
A-l-v-a-r-o.
First name Joseph.
No.
Black hair.
- No.

Dillon.
D-i-l-l-o-n.

D-i-l-l-o-n.
First name Lincoln.
No.
Next?

Caucasian.
Six foot seven. 217 pounds.
Eyes brown, hair blond. 34 years old.
Put it through the data fax.
Fast.
You guys better buckle up.
We're on approach to Lambert Field.
Fogle has four more names.
He knows two.
Both dark hair.
Third's a woman, fourth has a handicapped parking permit.
This is our man.
Rural Route 3, Chester.
Where is that?
From the airport you're closer.
We'll meet at the Hock Road off-ramp, Highway 94.
Let's go!
- Meet point's up ahead.
- Go on to the house.
- But Lieutenant Fisk said we...
- Go on to the house.
Will.
Will.
You're not gonna need that.
The SWAT team's gonna take him down, not us.
Will.
Will!
- This ought to be it, right here.
- Kill your lights.
- You all right?
- I'm OK.
Sherman's hurt bad.
I'll wait for the backup.
Set up a roadblock on Route 3.
Graham and I are in the trees west of the house.
- How far away's backup?
- Three minutes.
I'm goin' round the back.
Stay in the trees.
He's in there, Jack.
And he's got somebody in there with him.
What?
What... what did you say?
Will?
Wait for the backup, Will.
Will!
He's got somebody in the house with him, Jack.
Will.
Stop it.
Stop it!
# In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey
# Don't you know that I love you?
# In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey
# Oh, won't you come with me
# And take my hand?
# Oh, won't you come with me
# And walk this land?
# Please take my hand
It's OK.
Who are you?
Graham.
I'm Will Graham.
# I can hear your heartbeat
# Knocking on the window
Dad!
- Dad!
- Hey!
# I can hear your whispers
Oh, it looks worse than it is, pal.
See the turtles?
Wow!
- Hi.
- It was on the news.
I thought I'd work things out...
call you after.
I thought I wouldn't wait.

Subtitle Resynced by Ajitarsh.
We should have talked to the boatyard.
You don't wanna talk here.
I'm not falling over to talk about it much anywhere, jack.
How much do you know?
- Not much.
The Birmingham one was in the papers over a month ago, and Atlanta was all over TV.
Did you think about giving me a call?
- No. - why not?
I quit, remember?
You look alright now.
I am alright.
If you can't look anymore, I understand.
Don't play games with me!
If I really didn't need you, I wouldn't ask.
This guy's on a lunar cycle.
I have three weeks till full moon.
We have a better chance if you help me.
I'll think about it.
Stay and eat.
Think it'll keep them out, dad?
- Yep.
How many turtle's eggs are in here?
- In this hatchery?
40 or 50 of 'em.
Crabs get most of them, huh?
- Yeah, but not now.
These are all gonna make it.
What about the dogs?
No.
That's why we buried the wire down in the sand.
I need more staples, pal.
You're supposed to be his friend.
Why didn't you leave him alone?
If he decides to do it, molly,
I'll keep him as far away from it as I can.
We've got it pretty good.
- More than good.
All that happened before lets you know that.
If I went back, I'd only look at the evidence.
I wouldn't get involved.
He'd never even see me.
If they find him, they'll have to take him down.
What do you think?
You've already decided and you're not really asking.
If I were asking?
Stay here with me.
Me and Kevin.
That's selfish and I know it.
I'll come inside with you and show you around.
Mr. Crawford said maybe you want to be alone.
- That's right.
There's a VCR in your hotel room.
There's home movies of both families on half inch VHS.
Thanks.
Intruder entered through kitchen door.
Used a glass cutter on a suction cup.
Entry was skilful.
All prints are smooth gloves.
Blond hair, strong.
Size 12 shoe imprint.
Blood ab positive, from saliva on glass from the suction cup.
Why did he leave saliva on the glass?
It was hot that night, so it must have felt cool in the house.
Intruder cut Charles Leeds's throat then shot Mrs. Leeds.
Bullet lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation.
Moderate elevation of serotonin and an increase in histamine indicate she lived for 5 minutes after the shot.
All other injuries are post-mortem.
Direction of the blood stains on the wall indicate arterial spray.
Leeds tried to fight because intruder moved towards the children's room.
Blood stains on west wall in master bedroom and sliding marks on hall carpet remain unexplained,
as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leeds' chest.
Also believed post-mortem.
What did the killer do with them after they were dead?
Hi.
This is Valerie Leeds.
I can't speak right now, but if you leave a message after the beep, I'll get right back.
29th floor.
Going up.
When they were dead, he smashed the mirrors and selected pieces for use on Mrs. Leeds.
Killing Mr. Leeds and the children would take less than a minute.
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem 4 or 5 minutes later.
What did he do in the interval?
He smeared blood stains on the wall.
Hello?
- Molly?
Will, is that you?
- Yeah, honey.
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.
I love you.
- I love you too, baby.
What are you dreaming?
That's something you can't afford for me to know about.
God, she's lovely, isn't she?
It was maddening to touch her with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?
They found talcum powder on her leg, but there wasn't any in the bathroom.
It came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her.
You took off your gloves to touch her, didn't you?
You touched her with your bare hands and then you put your gloves back on!
But while your gloves were off, did you open all their eyes so they could see you?
Hallo?
- Jack, this is graham.
Is price still in latent prints?
- Yeah, the single print index.
What have you got?
- Get him to Atlanta.
Atlanta p.
D. Dusted everything and they're good.
- Not as good as price.
I'll send him tomorrow.
What do you want him to do?
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails and the corneas of all their eyes.
I think he took off his gloves.
The subject's teeth look like this.
These were reconstructed from the bite mark impressions we took from Mrs. Leeds and the jacobi woman.
He has pegged lateral incisors, that's these teeth here and here.
Vice and narcotics, you take the k-y cowboys and the leather bars.
Marcus, Whitman heads up at the funeral.
The rest, see the sheet.
One more thing.
I've heard officers call this killer the 'tooth fairy'.
Well, I don't wanna hear that in public or see it in memoranda!
That's it.
I know a burglar's gonna fence what he stole for cash money.
I know his motive, so I go to work on fences.
This guy, we don't have a motive.
None of us have shit and we know it.
It's in his dreams.
His motive?
- Yeah.
His act fuels his fantasy.
Which is?
- I don't know.
Commissioner says you're the one who got Garrett Jacob Hobbes and then dr.
Lecktor 3 years ago?
- Lecktor killed 90 people, didn't he?
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.
I heard he cut you pretty good.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's.
It has puncture wound.
The Jacobis had a cat.
That's right.
We found the litter box, but not the cat.
Give Birmingham p.
D. A methane probe out of Washington.
Have them cover the backyard.
Maybe the cat's buried there.
Yeah?
- This is Jimmie price, fbi.
Let me put you on the speaker.
- Who am I talking to?
Jack Crawford and will graham.
I got a partial print, probably a thumb.
And a fragment of a palm off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.
Thumb print came off the oldest kid's left eye.
Can we make an identification off it?
- Maybe if he's in my index.
Wanna work on these in the dark room.
I'll fax the prints this afternoon.
- Thanks.
If we get lucky with that print... if Jimmie can find him in the index.
- Hey, graham!
Whatta you say?
It's me, Lounds, from the "tattler".
I did the Lecktor paperback.
When did they call you in?
I'm buying lunch, alright?
- Give it a rest!
I'm doing my job.
How does he compare to Lecktor?
What does he do to them?
How does he do 'em, will?
Keep the fuck away from me!
- Will, will!
Son-of-a-bitch snuck into the hospital while I was sedated and took pictures.
I know.
- Don't expect too much from me.
We only got three weeks left.
- You think I'm just gonna see him?
That's Houdini!
The tooth fairy's gonna go on till we get smart or lucky.
He won't stop.
Why?
He's got a taste for it.
- You do know something about him.
Not enough.
I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.
Why?
Recover the mind set.
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court 3 years ago.
I keep getting it for Christmas.
Did you get my card?
- I got it, thank you.
How is officer Stuart?
Fine.
- Emotional problems, I hear.
Do you have any problems, will?
- No.
No, of course you don't.
I'm glad you came.
My callers are usually psychologists from cornfield universities.
Second-raters, the lot.
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction.
- And?
Very interesting, even to a layman.
I want you to help me, dr.
Lecktor.
- I thought so.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
- Yes?
- you read about it?
In the papers.
I don't tear out the articles.
I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid.
You want to know how he's choosing them.
Any ideas?
- Why should I tell you?
You get to see the file.
There's another reason.
- Pray tell.
You might be curious to see if you're smarter.
Smarter than you, since you caught me?
I know I'm not smart.
- Then how did you catch me?
Your disadvantages.
- What disadvantages?
You're insane.
You're very tanned, will.
Your hands are rough.
Not cop's hands any more.
And that shaving lotion is from a child?
With a ship on the bottle?
Don't think appeals to my intellectual vanity will work.
I don't think that.
You'll do it or you won't.
Dr. Bloom's working on it.
He's the best.
Have you got the file?
- Yes. - pictures?
- yes.
Let me have them and I'll consider it.
- No.
Dream much, will?
Goodbye, dr.
Lecktor.
You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
Let me have the file and I'll tell you what I think.
This is a very shy boy.
What were the yards like?
- Big, fences, hedges.
Why?
Because, if he imagines he has a relationship with the moon, he'll go look outside.
Ever seen blood in the moonlight?
It appears quite black.
If one were nude, it would be better to have privacy.
Interesting.
No.
You thought of it before.
- I considered it.
You wanted to look at me.
To get the scent back.
- I want your opinion.
I don't have one now.
- When you do, I want to hear it.
Can I keep this?
- Haven't decided.
- I'll study them.
Also any other files.
You can call me.
For calls to my lawyer I get a phone.
Will you leave me your home number?
No.
Do you know how you caught me?
There's a number on the file.
- Do you know how you caught me?
You caught me, will, because we're just alike.
You want the scent, smell yourself!
Gotcha!
Get up and face the wall.
Don't turn around, or I'll mace you in the face.
Thank you so much.
I'll call when I'm finished.
You ready for your call?
- Yes, thank you.
Paltrow, Christiansen and Golub, law offices.
I'm sorry, I misdialed.
Thank you for using ATT.
This is operator 24.
Operator, I don't have the use of my arms.
Would you dial a number for me?
- Certainly.
What's the number?
Area code 3-0-1.
5-5-5-6-6-2-4.
University of Chicago, department of psychiatry.
- Dr. Bloom, please.
I'll connect you with his office.
What's his secretary's name?
- Martha king.
Just a moment.
Martha king's desk.
- Hi, Martha.
Martha doesn't come in nights.
Maybe you can help me.
This is Bob Greer.
Dr. Bloom asked me to send a paper to someone, but I never got the address or number.
- She'll be in in the morning.
I've got to catch the federal express.
Could you pull it out of her rolodex?
I don't see a rolodex.
- I bet she has a call caddy.
Yeah.
- Well point right on down to g.
Alright.
- The last name is graham.
The man the book is for.
Mr. Will graham.
Federal bureau of investigation, 10th and Pennsylvania, Washington d.
C.
I bet his home address is there too.
3680 Desoto highway, Captiva, Florida.
Thank you very much.
Finished!
Mommy!
- Oh my gosh!
Lt's ok.
Stewardess?
There's a couple down from Duluth, we were talking about mortgages.
And...
I figure, you're gonna unload this turkey.
Well, then the squad car rolls up, they start asking questions, the whole grand tour:
Who was lying where and what.
Terrific.
So they get in their sedan and get the hell out of here.
Any single men ask to see the house?
No-one asked me.
You cut the branch so you could see.
Then you passed the time whittling and dreaming.
When night came, you saw them behind bright windows.
You watched the shades go down, saw the lights go out one by one.
Then you went in to 'em,
Didn't ya?
Didn't you, son-of-a-bitch?
You watched them all day long!
That's why houses with big yards.
I need the firearms and toolmarks section on the severed branch.
I need bowman to fall on this carving.
- Is it weird?
The mark?
Yeah.
If documents can't do it, Langley can.
- Did price get an identification?
No, not yet.
It's a hand search.
Have you seen the "tattler"?
It's not on my reading list.
- Yeah, well, you're all over the front page.
Who the hell was it, Lounds?
- Who else?
Goddammit, jack!
I promised molly.
Come in!
- Dr. Chilton?
- yes?
On cleaning out dr.
Lecktor's cell, he hid something in a book.
We dug around.
- Is that it?
Put it down.
Has anyone seen this except you?
- No.
Crawford's office.
- This is Chilton.
Mr. Graham please!
He's not here.
Mr. Crawford is on the line with him now.
Will you tell him this is very, very urgent.
I'll hold on.
Dr. Chilton, it's Crawford.
Graham is on the line, too.
I have two pieces of a note that appears to be from the murderer in Atlanta.
Where did you get it?
- Hidden in a book in Lecktor's cell.
Don't touch the note.
Read it to us!
- It's on toilet tissue.
"Dear dr.
Lecktor,
