Yeah, someone definitely took my stuff.
I just gotta check on jeremy before I go to the hospital.
Can you meet me there?
Ok.
I love you, stefan.
Jeremy?
You up?
[john groaning]
âª carry on, my wayward son âª âª there'll be peace when you are done âª
NARRATOR:
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:
STEFAN:
For over a century, I have lived in secret.
Until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
DAMON:
Elena, a dead ringer for Katherine.
- I want the invention.
- I don't have it.
But Damon does.
And you're gonna get it for me.
I'm not gonna give the device to Isobel so she can give it to John.
But it'll be useless.
Bonnie can take the spell off.
You took a risk with Damon.
How'd you know he would give it to me?
Because he's in love with you.
I couldn't do what she wanted me to do.
It wasn't right.
But when Elena finds out she's never gonna forgive me.
Ow.
This dress hurts.
Suck it in, baby.
CHEERLEADERS [CHANTING]:
Timberwolves!
Timberwolves!
Go Big Red!
No, no, no.
This lineup is all wrong.
The marching band is in front of the historical society.
Matt, time to get on your float.
Boys, I asked you to put the chairs on the Founder's float.
Ladies, time to get on your float.
DAMON:
Look at you, all retro.
- What are you doing here?
- Why wouldn't I be here?
Bonnie deactivated the Gilbert invention, Isobel's gone and it's Founder's Day.
I'm here to eat cotton candy and steal your girl.
[STEFAN SCOFFS]
- Don't start with me.
- Oh, you started it, Stefan with that whole "I'm insecure, leave Elena alone" speech.
I'm still enjoying that.
- As long as you heard it.
- Wait, huh?
What?
You have no sense of humor.
Actually, I just have no sense of Damon humor.
Damon humor?
Hey, look, I get it.
I get it.
I'm the better, hotter, superior choice and you're scared now that Katherine's out of the picture, I'm gonna turn to Elena.
But don't worry.
Elena is not Katherine.
You're right.
She's not.
Anna.
Look at you.
Heh.
I know, it's stupid, huh?
I'm part of the parade.
But how are you?
I've been so worried and I feel awful.
Why?
You didn't kill my mother.
Your uncle did.
Are you sure it was him?
Who else would've done it?
He doesn't understand, Anna.
It's who he is.
He hates all vampires.
He's just doing what he thinks is right.
Are you defending him?
No.
No way.
It's just...
I do understand where he's coming from.
He's convinced all the tomb vampires want revenge on this town and he's just...
He's trying to protect it.
They do want revenge.
Or at least they did.
But that's why we separated from them.
My mom wasn't after revenge.
She just wanted her life back.
I have to get out of this town, Jeremy.
You're leaving?
But I've been thinking, you could come.
I could turn you.
You said you wanted me to.
Here.
It's my blood.
If you die with it in your system, you'll come back.
- Anna...
- I know you.
What it's like for you.
Being alone, always feeling empty inside, no one to understand.
But when you're a vampire, you don't have to feel that way.
You can shut it off.
I can show you how.
I wanted to.
I did.
But I don't think I can.
I'm sorry.
John?
Is that even possible?
Well, there's no proof, but he dated Isobel when she was a teenager.
He brought her to your dad's office for the delivery.
My whole life I've never liked this man.
L...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I just...
Wanted to tell you before Damon dropped it on you in some inappropriate way.
No, I'm happy that you told me.
I just...
I really hope that it's not true.
What am I supposed to do?
Do I just confront him and say, "Are you my biological father?"
Well, I guess when you're ready.
I'm never gonna be ready.
Stefan, I have enough problems with the family that I actually care about.
Jeremy hates me.
And why wouldn't he?
My journal gave him every single reason to.
He's just hurt.
He's confused.
He's never gonna forgive me for Vicki.
For taking away his memory, for lying to him.
He's your brother.
He'll forgive you.
Just give him some time.
BONNIE:
Say cheese.
- Ooh, wait.
- Hide your cast.
It's not era-appropriate.
- Seriously?
CAROLINE:
Yes.
- Okay.
All right.
Come here.
[CAROLINE GIGGLING] [CAMERA BEEPS AND CLICKS]
I want one with Bonnie.
- Okay.
- I can take it.
I'll be on the float.
[SCOFFS]
I said I was sorry.
You made out with his mother and then you beat him to a pulp.
You're gonna have to do a little bit better than sorry.
ELENA:
Jeremy.
I was wondering where you were.
You look great.
- You guys did a really great job on the float.
- Go away, Elena.
Jeremy, please.
I don't want it to be like this between us.
Why don't you have Damon erase my memory again?
Then I could go back to being your in-the-dark brother.
- Jer, please.
- Just don't.
You can't fix this that easily.
Something like this doesn't just get fixed.
Let's give a big hand to the Mystic Falls High School Marching Band.
[CROWD CHEERING]
MAN:
Yeah!
MRS. LOCKWOOD:
And for a little local history Mr. Saltzman's students have re-created Virginia's Battle of Willow Creek.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our stunning Miss Mystic Falls court and their handsome escorts.
This is Caroline Forbes, Miss Mystic Falls.
Aren't they beautiful?
What do you want?
Just watching the parade.
- Where you going?
- Away from you.
- I wanna say something.
- Leave me alone.
Thank you.
The device that Emily spelled could've killed me.
I don't take what you did lightly so thank you.
- I did it for Elena.
- I know that, but I'm still very grateful.
And I owe you.
Enjoy the parade.
MAN:
Oh, there they are.
Look.
MRS. LOCKWOOD:
Let's cheer for the Mystic Falls High School football team.
All right.
Let's show them our support, everybody.
This is the key.
Once inserted, the device will be activated.
It will work only once for an estimated time of five minutes.
LOCKWOOD:
Yeah, so how does it work?
It's a high-pitched frequency that humans can't hear.
Any vampire within a five-block radius will be incapacitated, exposing them.
At that time, the sheriff's deputies will inject them with vervain and bring them here, where we'll finish them off.
- They're attacking tonight?
- I had a source.
One of the vampires from the tomb confirmed the attack.
Everybody listen up.
The plan stays the same.
We wait till the fireworks start.
Until then, we blend in.
Stay part of the celebration.
They'll never see us coming.
They want revenge for what our ancestors did in 1864.
Which makes us their targets.
This area here is the stage.
This is where the founding families are gonna be.
Any questions?
Taking an enormous risk.
Talking about our families, John.
Anna.
What are you doing here?
This is the only way.
Draw them out and kill them.
All of them.
I like you better like this.
Period look, it didn't suit you.
Is that an insult?
Actually, Elena, it is a compliment of the highest order.
Look, I know Stefan is worried about our friendship.
Did he mention something to you too?
- No.
Did he mention something to you?
- No.
Nothing worth repeating.
You should stop with the flirty comments and that eye thing that you do.
What eye thing?
Hm.
Don't make me regret being your friend.
Okay?
ELENA:
I don't believe that we can't fix this.
I lied.
I was wrong.
But you're my brother, Jer.
And I love you and I have to fix it.
So just tell me, what can I do?
You can go to hell, Elena.
I have so many emotions, but I don't have any way to express them.
- Being a teenager is so hard.
- Dick.
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm not your sister.
And from now on, don't talk to your sister that way either.
You're gonna kill me because I hurt Elena?
Cut her some slack.
- She erased my memories.
- No.
I did.
She was protecting you.
That wasn't her call to make.
- Let go before I cause a scene.
- You'd be unconscious before you even got a word out.
- Let him go.
You all right?
Yeah.
What my brother is trying to say is don't blame Elena for this.
Damon turned Vicki.
I killed her.
She was a threat to you and she was a threat to your sister.
I'm sorry that it happened.
I wish that it hadn't.
Shouldn't have made me forget.
- Good cop, bad cop.
I like it.
- What are you doing?
- He was a punk.
- Elena's relationship with her brother is none of your business.
Stay out of it.
- There's only one do-gooder role available.
Oh, my bad.
I'm sorry.
We both know you're not doing this for the right reasons.
See?
There you go with that little jealousy act again.
It just...
What are the right reasons, Stefan?
- Enlighten me, please.
- See, Damon it's only real when it comes from your desire to do the right thing.
For nothing in return.
- Right.
- And I know that is an entirely foreign concept to you.
I completely understand how you wouldn't get it.
You wanna use our town as bait?
It's too dangerous.
It's insane.
We've gone over the plans with your deputies.
They're all on board.
- You've gone behind me?
- We knew this is how you'd react.
- Our children are here.
- Liz, we need to do this.
We have no choice.
This is the reason for the secret council.
Our founding fathers created the secret council for just this purpose.
I'm the sheriff and it's my call and I say no.
Richard, let me speak to the sheriff alone.
John, you're not thinking clearly.
I'm not gonna change my mind about this.
[FORBES GRUNTS]
You're still around?
ANNA:
There's something you need to know.
The vampires from the tomb are planning an attack tonight.
- How do you know?
- I went to them.
They think I'm with them.
I'm not.
They want the founding families dead.
When is this supposed to happen?
When the fireworks start.
John Gilbert wants to use that invention on them.
- We can't be here.
- Doesn't work.
It's been deactivated.
- Then a lot of people are gonna die.
- Where are they right now?
They're already here, Damon.
Remember, we don't know which of them ingests vervain.
It's not about the feed.
It's about the kill.
You know what to do.
DAMON:
Ric.
- Yeah.
Come here.
You keep those nifty vamp weapons in the car?
Yeah.
Why do you ask?
This square is crawling with tomb vampires.
We might need a stake or two.
- Yeah.
Got it.
- Go.
ELENA:
I know.
Can you imagine?
[ELENA GIGGLING]
Hey.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Fifteen words or less, tomb vamps are here.
Founding families are the target.
- Get her out of here.
Now.
- Wait.
Where are you going?
- That's more than 15 words, Stefan.
ELENA:
Wait.
Jeremy's out here.
Let's go find him.
Come on.
There was this time, freshman year when Bonnie and I were in a fight and we swore that we would never talk again.
Caroline, give it a rest.
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
I told you to go home.
- I decided not to.
- Lf I tell you to do something, you do it.
- Get off me.
- Mayor.
Is everything okay?
Please, Tyler.
I need you to go home.
Now.
- Take your friends with you.
- Wait.
Why?
What's going on?
I can't explain.
All of you need to get home now.
Please.
Yeah, okay.
LOCKWOOD:
Here.
Take my car.
It's out back.
Caroline, Matt, go with him.
Come on.
Anna, my uncle could see you.
I don't care about that.
I needed to find you.
Come here.
For 150 years Mystic Falls has been the kind of town that everybody wants to call home.
Safe, prosperous, welcoming.
And we have the founders to thank for that.
That's why I'd like to dedicate this evening's fireworks display to their legacy.
Get into position.
LOCKWOOD:
Enjoy the show.
[CROWD CHEERING]
Stay close, dear.
- Oh, sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Do you have any idea what you've done?
Yes.
As a matter of fact, I do.
[DEVICE SCREECHING]
[DAMON YELLING]
[STEFAN GRUNTING]
Stefan?
What's going on?
What's happening?
- My head.
- What?
My head.
Anna?
Anna, what's wrong?
Anna?
- Please make it stop.
- What's happening?
What the hell is that?
What's the matter?
- That noise.
- Wait.
What noise?
- Oh!
- Whoa.
- Tyler?
Tyler!
- Dude, hey!
[SCREAMING]
- Caroline, the wheel!
- Tyler!
[TIRES SCREECHING]
Hey.
I got this one.
There's another one over there.
Take this.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Get up.
ELENA:
He just dropped.
ALARIC:
Yeah, he's not the only one.
Cops are grabbing everyone who's down.
Injecting vervain.
- What?
- Yeah.
They're rounding up the vampires.
Please help him.
He just went down.
MAN:
Is that the mayor?
MRS. LOCKWOOD:
Richard.
WOMAN:
Is he all right?
[ANNA SCREAMING]
My head.
Jeremy.
Hey, I got one.
Hey, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?
Leave her alone.
DEPUTY:
All right.
- What are you doing?
Leave her alone!
DEPUTY:
Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
- Leave her alone!
Anna!
The device is done.
The only thing keeping them down is the vervain.
We don't have much time.
Let's finish this.
[ANNA GASPING]
Anna.
You head up.
I'll take it from here.
Please.
No.
[GASPS]
[VAMPIRE YELLING]
- You okay?
- It was like needles were piercing my skull.
And then it just stopped.
I saw at least five vampires go down.
They're taking them to your family's old building.
It's the Gilbert device.
It has to be.
But how did he get it to work?
Bonnie unspelled it.
Or maybe she didn't.
She did.
We saw her do it.
No.
He's right.
Think about it.
We asked Bonnie to deactivate a device that could protect people against vampires.
So we could protect you.
And Damon.
Vampires.
- Where's Damon?
- I don't know.
I haven't seen him since this started.
- Can you get my brother?
Take him home?
- Of course.
Let's go.
- Liz.
You okay?
What is going on?
- There's a key in my belt.
There's a key in my belt.
I need you to get it.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Something's happened to Richard.
- They took him.
- Who took him?
Your deputies.
I don't understand.
He's not a vampire.
Let's go.
Mayor.
- Is that you?
- What are you doing here?
I'm a vampire.
What is your excuse?
No, really.
The vervain didn't affect you.
You're not a vampire.
What the hell are you?
Mayor Lockwood.
[LOCKWOOD GRUNTING] [BONE SNAPS]
You okay?
Your side took the biggest hit.
- I'm fine.
- No, they need to check you out.
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
They're helping Tyler.
Pulse is steadying.
All right.
What the hell?
What?
What's wrong?
The eyes.
[GASPS]
- What happened?
- Dude, don't scare me like that.
WOMAN:
Hey.
She needs some help over here.
MATT:
Caroline.
- Over here.
Caroline.
PARAMEDIC:
There.
Get that one.
Caroline, hey.
Wake up.
We're gonna get you home.
Wake up, Car.
Wait, wait, wait.
I can hear them.
- The building is on fire.
ELENA:
What?
STEFAN:
Building's on fire.
Where is Damon?
With the rest of them, where he should be.
It's over for Damon.
You're crazy.
Why?
Because I'm doing what should've been done 145 years ago?
This is the right thing, Elena.
Go ahead.
You won't make it out.
You'll save me the trouble of killing you myself.
You know the building well.
Is there another entrance in?
Utility door.
There's one around the side.
One more step and I'll alert those deputies they missed a vampire.
I'm asking you not to.
That doesn't mean anything to me.
As my father, it should.
You know.
I wasn't sure.
But now I am.
BONNIE:
Hey!
You can't go in there.
The fire will take you out.
He's my brother, Bonnie.
[GRUNTS]
ELENA:
Stefan!
- Elena, you can't go in there.
- Bonnie, what are you doing?
I'm sorry I lied to you.
[GASPING]
[BONNIE SPEAKING IN MYSTICAL LANGUAGE]
I've gotta get in there.
[VAMPIRES GROANING AND YELLING]
[BONNIE SPEAKING IN MYSTICAL LANGUAGE]
Damon.
Come on.
Hurry up.
[YELLING]
Bonnie.
Bonnie, what is it?
Are they gonna be okay?
[DAMON COUGHING]
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
[INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]
FIREMAN:
Two 10-45s will be treated at county...
The fire is out.
The story is that the building's old wiring is what caused it.
Did you see where Damon went?
No.
He just kind of disappeared.
Figures.
I'm so glad you're okay.
[STEFAN SIGHS]
I try so hard to hate him.
I guess it's just pointless.
You care about him.
So do I.
But I love you, Stefan.
And I know that you're worried about that.
Well, I just...
You know, I know my brother.
But I love you, Stefan.
I know the trouble he can cause...
I love you, Stefan.
You.
You have nothing to worry about.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
So I...
Jenna called.
Jeremy is home.
I'm just gonna run over to the school to pick up my dress, my clothes, my stuff and then I'll check on him.
What are you doing here?
Anna's dead.
I figured that once they took her away.
I know you cared about her.
Yeah, I did.
I saw her killed.
I was watching and all I could think about was...
I wanted to help her.
But I couldn't.
Why are you telling me all this?
I took away your suffering once before.
I can do it again.
But it's your choice.
Look I know you think you took it away but it's still there.
Even if I can't remember why, I still feel empty.
Alone.
And making me forget won't fix it.
It won't fix what's really wrong.
What I did to Vicki was wrong.
Sorry for my part.
Anna said that vampires don't have to feel pain.
That they could turn it off if they shut out their humanity.
That's very true.
Is it easier that way?
Is what easier?
Life.
Life sucks either way, Jeremy.
If you're a vampire, you don't have to feel bad if you don't want to.
Is that what you did?
I did it for...
I did it for a very long time.
And life was a lot easier.
Hey, man.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I don't even know what happened.
It's okay, man.
She'll be all right.
What's happening?
She all right?
There was internal bleeding.
They're taking her into surgery.
What else did they say?
Is she gonna be okay?
They're gonna do everything they can.
Tyler, have you talked to your mom?
I left her a message telling her I was here.
You need to call her.
What is it?
It's your dad.
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.
- You just missed Elena.
- I was looking for you, actually.
Oh.
Elena is my best friend.
And because she loves you, I couldn't let you or Damon die in that fire.
I'm grateful, Bonnie.
I hope you know that.
I do.
But I hope you know that things have to change.
Damon has to change.
We both want the same thing.
We both wanna protect the people we care about.
The difference is, for you, Damon is one of them.
You saw what I was able to do tonight.
I know who I am now.
And if Damon spills so much as one drop of innocent blood I'll take him down.
Even if I have to take you with him.
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
Let's hope it doesn't.
What are you doing here?
A failed and feeble attempt at doing the right thing.
Which was?
It's not important.
Let me take this for you.
Thank you.
You know, I came in this town wanting to destroy it.
Tonight I found myself wanting to protect it.
How does that happen?
I'm not a hero, Elena.
I don't do good.
It's not in me.
Maybe it is.
No.
No, that's reserved for my brother and you and Bonnie.
Even though she has every reason to hate me, still helped Stefan save me.
Why do you sound so surprised?
She did it for you.
Which means somewhere along the way you decided that I was worth saving.
And I wanted to thank you for that.
You're welcome.
[DOOR OPENS]
Hi.
It's late.
You should probably come inside.
What are you doing?
I don't wanna talk about it.
You scared me.
I'm sorry.
You know, I first met Isobel when I was a teenager.
I fell in love with her instantly, although I'm pretty sure she never loved me.
She was special.
Part of why I hate the vampires so much is because of what she became.
How it ruined her.
And I never would've sent her to Damon had I known she wanted to turn.
It's my fault.
I'm telling you this because I hope maybe you'd understand.
Thank you.
Can I help?
Sure.
[SCREAMING]
Katherine?
Hello, John.
Goodbye, John.
[GRUNTING]
ELENA:
I looked everywhere.
Yeah.
Someone definitely took my stuff.
I gotta check on Jeremy before I go to the hospital.
Can you meet me there?
Okay.
I love you, Stefan.
Jeremy?
Are you up?

- I don't have it.
But Damon does.
And you're gonna get it for me.
I'm not gonna give the device to Isobel so she can give it to John.
But it'll be useless.
Bonnie can take the spell off.
You took a risk with Damon.
How'd you know he would give it to me?
Because he's in love with you.
I couldn't do what she wanted me to do.
It wasn't right.
But when Elena finds out she's never gonna forgive me.
Ow.
This dress hurts.
Suck it in, baby.

Hey, look, I get it.

I'm the better, hotter, superior choice and you're scared now that Katherine's out of the picture, I'm gonna turn to Elena.

Elena is not Katherine.
You're right.
She's not.
Anna.
Look at you.
Heh.
I know, it's stupid, huh?

But I've been thinking, you could come.
I could turn you.
You said you wanted me to.
Here.
It's my blood.
If you die with it in your system, you'll come back.
- Anna...
- I know you.
What it's like for you.
Being alone, always feeling empty inside, no one to understand.
But when you're a vampire, you don't have to feel that way.
You can shut it off.
I can show you how.
I wanted to.
I did.
But I don't think I can.
I'm sorry.
John?
Is that even possible?
Well, there's no proof, but he dated Isobel when she was a teenager.

Do I just confront him and say, "Are you my biological father?"
Well, I guess when you're ready.
I'm never gonna be ready.
Stefan, I have enough problems with the family that I actually care about.
Jeremy hates me.
And why wouldn't he?

He's just hurt.
He's confused.
He's never gonna forgive me for Vicki.
For taking away his memory, for lying to him.
He's your brother.
He'll forgive you.
Just give him some time.
BONNIE:
Say cheese.
- Ooh, wait.
- Hide your cast.
It's not era-appropriate.
- Seriously?
CAROLINE:
Yes.
- Okay.
All right.
Come here.
[CAROLINE GIGGLING] [CAMERA BEEPS AND CLICKS]
I want one with Bonnie.
- Okay.
- I can take it.
I'll be on the float.
[SCOFFS]
I said I was sorry.
You made out with his mother and then you beat him to a pulp.
You're gonna have to do a little bit better than sorry.
ELENA:
Jeremy.
I was wondering where you were.
You look great.
- You guys did a really great job on the float.
- Go away, Elena.
Jeremy, please.
I don't want it to be like this between us.
Why don't you have Damon erase my memory again?
Then I could go back to being your in-the-dark brother.
- Jer, please.
- Just don't.
You can't fix this that easily.
Something like this doesn't just get fixed.
Let's give a big hand to the Mystic Falls High School Marching Band.
[CROWD CHEERING]
MAN:
Yeah!
MRS. LOCKWOOD:
And for a little local history Mr. Saltzman's students have re-created Virginia's Battle of Willow Creek.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our stunning Miss Mystic Falls court and their handsome escorts.
This is Caroline Forbes, Miss Mystic Falls.
Aren't they beautiful?
What do you want?
Just watching the parade.
- Where you going?
- Away from you.
- I wanna say something.
- Leave me alone.
Thank you.
The device that Emily spelled could've killed me.
I don't take what you did lightly so thank you.
- I did it for Elena.
- I know that, but I'm still very grateful.
And I owe you.
Enjoy the parade.
MAN:
Oh, there they are.
Look.
MRS. LOCKWOOD:
Let's cheer for the Mystic Falls High School football team.
All right.
Let's show them our support, everybody.
This is the key.
Once inserted, the device will be activated.
It will work only once for an estimated time of five minutes.
LOCKWOOD:
Yeah, so how does it work?
It's a high-pitched frequency that humans can't hear.
Any vampire within a five-block radius will be incapacitated, exposing them.
At that time, the sheriff's deputies will inject them with vervain and bring them here, where we'll finish them off.
- They're attacking tonight?
- I had a source.
One of the vampires from the tomb confirmed the attack.
Everybody listen up.
The plan stays the same.
We wait till the fireworks start.
Until then, we blend in.
Stay part of the celebration.
They'll never see us coming.
They want revenge for what our ancestors did in 1864.
Which makes us their targets.
This area here is the stage.
This is where the founding families are gonna be.
Any questions?
Taking an enormous risk.
Talking about our families, John.
Anna.
What are you doing here?
This is the only way.
Draw them out and kill them.
All of them.
I like you better like this.
Period look, it didn't suit you.
Is that an insult?
Actually, Elena, it is a compliment of the highest order.
Look, I know Stefan is worried about our friendship.
Did he mention something to you too?
- No.
Did he mention something to you?
- No.
Nothing worth repeating.
You should stop with the flirty comments and that eye thing that you do.
What eye thing?
Hm.
Don't make me regret being your friend.
Okay?
ELENA:
I don't believe that we can't fix this.
I lied.
I was wrong.
But you're my brother, Jer.
And I love you and I have to fix it.
So just tell me, what can I do?
You can go to hell, Elena.
I have so many emotions, but I don't have any way to express them.
- Being a teenager is so hard.
- Dick.
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm not your sister.
And from now on, don't talk to your sister that way either.
You're gonna kill me because I hurt Elena?
Cut her some slack.
- She erased my memories.
- No.
I did.
She was protecting you.
That wasn't her call to make.
- Let go before I cause a scene.
- You'd be unconscious before you even got a word out.
- Let him go.
You all right?
Yeah.
What my brother is trying to say is don't blame Elena for this.
Damon turned Vicki.
I killed her.
She was a threat to you and she was a threat to your sister.
I'm sorry that it happened.
I wish that it hadn't.
Shouldn't have made me forget.
- Good cop, bad cop.
I like it.
- What are you doing?
- He was a punk.
- Elena's relationship with her brother is none of your business.
Stay out of it.
- There's only one do-gooder role available.
Oh, my bad.
I'm sorry.
We both know you're not doing this for the right reasons.
See?
There you go with that little jealousy act again.
It just...
What are the right reasons, Stefan?
- Enlighten me, please.
- See, Damon it's only real when it comes from your desire to do the right thing.
For nothing in return.
- Right.
- And I know that is an entirely foreign concept to you.
I completely understand how you wouldn't get it.
You wanna use our town as bait?
It's too dangerous.
It's insane.
We've gone over the plans with your deputies.
They're all on board.
- You've gone behind me?
- We knew this is how you'd react.
- Our children are here.
- Liz, we need to do this.
We have no choice.
This is the reason for the secret council.
Our founding fathers created the secret council for just this purpose.
I'm the sheriff and it's my call and I say no.
Richard, let me speak to the sheriff alone.
John, you're not thinking clearly.
I'm not gonna change my mind about this.
[FORBES GRUNTS]
You're still around?
ANNA:
There's something you need to know.
The vampires from the tomb are planning an attack tonight.
- How do you know?
- I went to them.
They think I'm with them.
I'm not.
They want the founding families dead.
When is this supposed to happen?
When the fireworks start.
John Gilbert wants to use that invention on them.
- We can't be here.
- Doesn't work.
It's been deactivated.
- Then a lot of people are gonna die.
- Where are they right now?
They're already here, Damon.
Remember, we don't know which of them ingests vervain.
It's not about the feed.
It's about the kill.
You know what to do.
DAMON:
Ric.
- Yeah.
Come here.
You keep those nifty vamp weapons in the car?
Yeah.
Why do you ask?
This square is crawling with tomb vampires.
We might need a stake or two.
- Yeah.
Got it.
- Go.
ELENA:
I know.
Can you imagine?
[ELENA GIGGLING]
Hey.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Fifteen words or less, tomb vamps are here.
Founding families are the target.
- Get her out of here.
Now.
- Wait.
Where are you going?
- That's more than 15 words, Stefan.
ELENA:
Wait.
Jeremy's out here.
Let's go find him.
Come on.
There was this time, freshman year when Bonnie and I were in a fight and we swore that we would never talk again.
Caroline, give it a rest.
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
I told you to go home.
- I decided not to.
- Lf I tell you to do something, you do it.
- Get off me.
- Mayor.
Is everything okay?
Please, Tyler.
I need you to go home.
Now.
- Take your friends with you.
- Wait.
Why?
What's going on?
I can't explain.
All of you need to get home now.
Please.
Yeah, okay.
LOCKWOOD:
Here.
Take my car.
It's out back.
Caroline, Matt, go with him.
Come on.
Anna, my uncle could see you.
I don't care about that.
I needed to find you.
Come here.
For 150 years Mystic Falls has been the kind of town that everybody wants to call home.
Safe, prosperous, welcoming.
And we have the founders to thank for that.
That's why I'd like to dedicate this evening's fireworks display to their legacy.
Get into position.
LOCKWOOD:
Enjoy the show.
[CROWD CHEERING]
Stay close, dear.
- Oh, sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Do you have any idea what you've done?
Yes.
As a matter of fact, I do.
[DEVICE SCREECHING]
[DAMON YELLING]
[STEFAN GRUNTING]
Stefan?
What's going on?
What's happening?
- My head.
- What?
My head.
Anna?
Anna, what's wrong?
Anna?
- Please make it stop.
- What's happening?
What the hell is that?
What's the matter?
- That noise.
- Wait.
What noise?
- Oh!
- Whoa.
- Tyler?
Tyler!
- Dude, hey!
[SCREAMING]
- Caroline, the wheel!
- Tyler!
[TIRES SCREECHING]
Hey.
I got this one.
There's another one over there.
Take this.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Get up.
ELENA:
He just dropped.
ALARIC:
Yeah, he's not the only one.
Cops are grabbing everyone who's down.
Injecting vervain.
- What?
- Yeah.
They're rounding up the vampires.
Please help him.
He just went down.
MAN:
Is that the mayor?
MRS. LOCKWOOD:
Richard.
WOMAN:
Is he all right?
[ANNA SCREAMING]
My head.
Jeremy.
Hey, I got one.
Hey, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?
Leave her alone.
DEPUTY:
All right.
- What are you doing?
Leave her alone!
DEPUTY:
Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
- Leave her alone!
Anna!
The device is done.
The only thing keeping them down is the vervain.
We don't have much time.
Let's finish this.
[ANNA GASPING]
Anna.
You head up.
I'll take it from here.
Please.
No.
[GASPS]
[VAMPIRE YELLING]
- You okay?
- It was like needles were piercing my skull.
And then it just stopped.
I saw at least five vampires go down.
They're taking them to your family's old building.
It's the Gilbert device.
It has to be.
But how did he get it to work?
Bonnie unspelled it.
Or maybe she didn't.
She did.
We saw her do it.
No.
He's right.
Think about it.
We asked Bonnie to deactivate a device that could protect people against vampires.
So we could protect you.
And Damon.
Vampires.
- Where's Damon?
- I don't know.
I haven't seen him since this started.
- Can you get my brother?
Take him home?
- Of course.
Let's go.
- Liz.
You okay?
What is going on?
- There's a key in my belt.
There's a key in my belt.
I need you to get it.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Something's happened to Richard.
- They took him.
- Who took him?
Your deputies.
I don't understand.
He's not a vampire.
Let's go.
Mayor.
- Is that you?
- What are you doing here?
I'm a vampire.
What is your excuse?
No, really.
The vervain didn't affect you.
You're not a vampire.
What the hell are you?
Mayor Lockwood.
[LOCKWOOD GRUNTING] [BONE SNAPS]
You okay?
Your side took the biggest hit.
- I'm fine.
- No, they need to check you out.
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
They're helping Tyler.
Pulse is steadying.
All right.
What the hell?
What?
What's wrong?
The eyes.
[GASPS]
- What happened?
- Dude, don't scare me like that.
WOMAN:
Hey.
She needs some help over here.
MATT:
Caroline.
- Over here.
Caroline.
PARAMEDIC:
There.
Get that one.
Caroline, hey.
Wake up.
We're gonna get you home.
Wake up, Car.
Wait, wait, wait.
I can hear them.
- The building is on fire.
ELENA:
What?
STEFAN:
Building's on fire.
Where is Damon?
With the rest of them, where he should be.
It's over for Damon.
You're crazy.
Why?
Because I'm doing what should've been done 145 years ago?
This is the right thing, Elena.
Go ahead.
You won't make it out.
You'll save me the trouble of killing you myself.
You know the building well.
Is there another entrance in?
Utility door.
There's one around the side.
One more step and I'll alert those deputies they missed a vampire.
I'm asking you not to.
That doesn't mean anything to me.
As my father, it should.
You know.
I wasn't sure.
But now I am.
BONNIE:
Hey!
You can't go in there.
The fire will take you out.
He's my brother, Bonnie.
[GRUNTS]
ELENA:
Stefan!
- Elena, you can't go in there.
- Bonnie, what are you doing?
I'm sorry I lied to you.
[GASPING]
[BONNIE SPEAKING IN MYSTICAL LANGUAGE]
I've gotta get in there.
[VAMPIRES GROANING AND YELLING]
[BONNIE SPEAKING IN MYSTICAL LANGUAGE]
Damon.
Come on.
Hurry up.
[YELLING]
Bonnie.
Bonnie, what is it?
Are they gonna be okay?
[DAMON COUGHING]
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
[INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER]
FIREMAN:
Two 10-45s will be treated at county...
The fire is out.
The story is that the building's old wiring is what caused it.
Did you see where Damon went?
No.
He just kind of disappeared.
Figures.
I'm so glad you're okay.
[STEFAN SIGHS]
I try so hard to hate him.
I guess it's just pointless.
You care about him.
So do I.
But I love you, Stefan.
And I know that you're worried about that.
Well, I just...
You know, I know my brother.
But I love you, Stefan.
I know the trouble he can cause...
I love you, Stefan.
You.
You have nothing to worry about.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
So I...
Jenna called.
Jeremy is home.
I'm just gonna run over to the school to pick up my dress, my clothes, my stuff and then I'll check on him.
What are you doing here?
Anna's dead.
I figured that once they took her away.
I know you cared about her.
Yeah, I did.
I saw her killed.
I was watching and all I could think about was...
I wanted to help her.
But I couldn't.
Why are you telling me all this?
I took away your suffering once before.
I can do it again.
But it's your choice.
Look I know you think you took it away but it's still there.
Even if I can't remember why, I still feel empty.
Alone.
And making me forget won't fix it.
It won't fix what's really wrong.
What I did to Vicki was wrong.
Sorry for my part.
Anna said that vampires don't have to feel pain.
That they could turn it off if they shut out their humanity.
That's very true.
Is it easier that way?
Is what easier?
Life.
Life sucks either way, Jeremy.
If you're a vampire, you don't have to feel bad if you don't want to.
Is that what you did?
I did it for...
I did it for a very long time.
And life was a lot easier.
Hey, man.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I don't even know what happened.
It's okay, man.
She'll be all right.
What's happening?
She all right?
There was internal bleeding.
They're taking her into surgery.
What else did they say?
Is she gonna be okay?
They're gonna do everything they can.
Tyler, have you talked to your mom?
I left her a message telling her I was here.
You need to call her.
What is it?
It's your dad.
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.
- You just missed Elena.
- I was looking for you, actually.
Oh.
Elena is my best friend.
And because she loves you, I couldn't let you or Damon die in that fire.
I'm grateful, Bonnie.
I hope you know that.
I do.
But I hope you know that things have to change.
Damon has to change.
We both want the same thing.
We both wanna protect the people we care about.
The difference is, for you, Damon is one of them.
You saw what I was able to do tonight.
I know who I am now.
And if Damon spills so much as one drop of innocent blood I'll take him down.
Even if I have to take you with him.
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
Let's hope it doesn't.
What are you doing here?
A failed and feeble attempt at doing the right thing.
Which was?
It's not important.
Let me take this for you.
Thank you.
You know, I came in this town wanting to destroy it.
Tonight I found myself wanting to protect it.
How does that happen?
I'm not a hero, Elena.
I don't do good.
It's not in me.
Maybe it is.
No.
No, that's reserved for my brother and you and Bonnie.
Even though she has every reason to hate me, still helped Stefan save me.
Why do you sound so surprised?
She did it for you.
Which means somewhere along the way you decided that I was worth saving.
And I wanted to thank you for that.
You're welcome.
[DOOR OPENS]
Hi.
It's late.
You should probably come inside.
What are you doing?
I don't wanna talk about it.
You scared me.
I'm sorry.
You know, I first met Isobel when I was a teenager.
I fell in love with her instantly, although I'm pretty sure she never loved me.
She was special.
Part of why I hate the vampires so much is because of what she became.
How it ruined her.
And I never would've sent her to Damon had I known she wanted to turn.
It's my fault.
I'm telling you this because I hope maybe you'd understand.
Thank you.
Can I help?
Sure.
[SCREAMING]
Katherine?
Hello, John.
Goodbye, John.
[GRUNTING]
ELENA:
I looked everywhere.
Yeah.
Someone definitely took my stuff.
I gotta check on Jeremy before I go to the hospital.
Can you meet me there?
Okay.
I love you, Stefan.
Jeremy?
Are you up?
[CLANKING]
ripped by looxlike
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:
For over a century, I have lived in secret.
Until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
Elena, a dead ringer for Katherine.
- I want the invention.
- I don't have it.
But Damon does.
And you're gonna get it for me.
I'm not gonna give the device to Isobel so she can give it to John.
But it'll be useless.
Bonnie can take the spell off.
You took a risk with Damon.
How'd you know he would give it to me?
Because he's in love with you.
I couldn't do what she wanted me to do.
It wasn't right.
But when Elena finds out she's never gonna forgive me.
Ow.
This dress hurts.
Suck it in, baby.
Timberwolves!
Timberwolves!
Go Big Red!
No, no, no.
This lineup is all wrong.
The marching band is in front of the historical society.
Matt, time to get on your float.
Boys, I asked you to put the chairs on the Founder's float.
Ladies, time to get on your float.
Look at you, all retro.
- What are you doing here?
- Why wouldn't I be here?
Bonnie deactivated the Gilbert invention, Isobel's gone and it's Founder's Day.
I'm here to eat cotton candy and steal your girl.
- Don't start with me.
- Oh, you started it, Stefan with that whole "I'm insecure, leave Elena alone" speech.
I'm still enjoying that.
- As long as you heard it.
- Wait, huh?
What?
You have no sense of humor.
Actually, I just have no sense of Damon humor.
Damon humor?
Hey, look, I get it.
I get it.
I'm the better, hotter, superior choice and you're scared now that Katherine's out of the picture, I'm gonna turn to Elena.
But don't worry.
Elena is not Katherine.
You're right.
She's not.
Anna.
Look at you.
Heh.
I know, it's stupid, huh?
I'm part of the parade.
But how are you?
I've been so worried and I feel awful.
Why?
You didn't kill my mother.
Your uncle did.
Are you sure it was him?
Who else would've done it?
He doesn't understand, Anna.
It's who he is.
He hates all vampires.
He's just doing what he thinks is right.
Are you defending him?
No.
No way.
It's just...
I do understand where he's coming from.
He's convinced all the tomb vampires want revenge on this town and he's just...
He's trying to protect it.
They do want revenge.
Or at least they did.
But that's why we separated from them.
My mom wasn't after revenge.
She just wanted her life back.
I have to get out of this town, Jeremy.
You're leaving?
But I've been thinking, you could come.
I could turn you.
You said you wanted me to.
Here.
It's my blood.
If you die with it in your system, you'll come back.
- Anna...
- I know you.
What it's like for you.
Being alone, always feeling empty inside, no one to understand.
But when you're a vampire, you don't have to feel that way.
You can shut it off.
I can show you how.
I wanted to.
I did.
But I don't think I can.
I'm sorry.
John?
Is that even possible?
Well, there's no proof, but he dated Isobel when she was a teenager.
He brought her to your dad's office for the delivery.
My whole life I've never liked this man.
L...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I just...
Wanted to tell you before Damon dropped it on you in some inappropriate way.
No, I'm happy that you told me.
I just...
I really hope that it's not true.
What am I supposed to do?
Do I just confront him and say, "Are you my biological father?"
Well, I guess when you're ready.
I'm never gonna be ready.
Stefan, I have enough problems with the family that I actually care about.
Jeremy hates me.
And why wouldn't he?
My journal gave him every single reason to.
He's just hurt.
He's confused.
He's never gonna forgive me for Vicki.
For taking away his memory, for lying to him.
He's your brother.
He'll forgive you.
Just give him some time.
- Say cheese.
- Ooh, wait.
- Hide your cast.
It's not era-appropriate.
- Seriously?
- Yes.
- Okay.
All right.
Come here.
I want one with Bonnie.
- Okay.
- I can take it.
I'll be on the float.
I said I was sorry.
You made out with his mother and then you beat him to a pulp.
You're gonna have to do a little bit better than sorry.
Jeremy.
I was wondering where you were.
You look great.
- You guys did a really great job on the float.
- Go away, Elena.
Jeremy, please.
I don't want it to be like this between us.
Why don't you have Damon erase my memory again?
Then I could go back to being your in-the-dark brother.
- Jer, please.
- Just don't.
You can't fix this that easily.
Something like this doesn't just get fixed.
Let's give a big hand to the Mystic Falls High School Marching Band.
Yeah!
And for a little local history Mr. Saltzman's students have re-created Virginia's Battle of Willow Creek.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our stunning Miss Mystic Falls court and their handsome escorts.
This is Caroline Forbes, Miss Mystic Falls.
Aren't they beautiful?
What do you want?
Just watching the parade.
- Where you going?
- Away from you.
- I wanna say something.
- Leave me alone.
Thank you.

I don't take what you did lightly so thank you.
- I did it for Elena.
- I know that, but I'm still very grateful.
And I owe you.
Enjoy the parade.
Oh, there they are.
Look.
Let's cheer for the Mystic Falls High School football team.
All right.
Let's show them our support, everybody.
This is the key.
Once inserted, the device will be activated.
It will work only once for an estimated time of five minutes.
Yeah, so how does it work?
It's a high-pitched frequency that humans can't hear.
Any vampire within a five-block radius will be incapacitated, exposing them.
At that time, the sheriff's deputies will inject them with vervain and bring them here, where we'll finish them off.
- They're attacking tonight?
- I had a source.
One of the vampires from the tomb confirmed the attack.
Everybody listen up.
The plan stays the same.
We wait till the fireworks start.
Until then, we blend in.
Stay part of the celebration.
They'll never see us coming.
They want revenge for what our ancestors did in 1864.
Which makes us their targets.
This area here is the stage.
This is where the founding families are gonna be.
Any questions?
Taking an enormous risk.
Talking about our families, John.
Anna.
What are you doing here?
This is the only way.
Draw them out and kill them.
All of them.
I like you better like this.
Period look, it didn't suit you.
Is that an insult?
Actually, Elena, it is a compliment of the highest order.
Look, I know Stefan is worried about our friendship.
Did he mention something to you too?
- No.
Did he mention something to you?
- No.
Nothing worth repeating.
You should stop with the flirty comments and that eye thing that you do.
What eye thing?
Hm.
Don't make me regret being your friend.
Okay?
I don't believe that we can't fix this.
I lied.
I was wrong.
But you're my brother, Jer.
And I love you and I have to fix it.
So just tell me, what can I do?
You can go to hell, Elena.
I have so many emotions, but I don't have any way to express them.
- Being a teenager is so hard.
- Dick.
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm not your sister.
And from now on, don't talk to your sister that way either.
You're gonna kill me because I hurt Elena?
Cut her some slack.
- She erased my memories.
- No.
I did.
She was protecting you.
That wasn't her call to make.
- Let go before I cause a scene.
- You'd be unconscious before you even got a word out.
- Let him go.
You all right?
Yeah.
What my brother is trying to say is don't blame Elena for this.
Damon turned Vicki.
I killed her.
She was a threat to you and she was a threat to your sister.
I'm sorry that it happened.
I wish that it hadn't.
Shouldn't have made me forget.
- Good cop, bad cop.
I like it.
- What are you doing?
- He was a punk.
- Elena's relationship with her brother is none of your business.
Stay out of it.
- There's only one do-gooder role available.
Oh, my bad.
I'm sorry.
We both know you're not doing this for the right reasons.
See?
There you go with that little jealousy act again.
It just...
What are the right reasons, Stefan?
- Enlighten me, please.
- See, Damon it's only real when it comes from your desire to do the right thing.
For nothing in return.
- Right.
- And I know that is an entirely foreign concept to you.
I completely understand how you wouldn't get it.
You wanna use our town as bait?
It's too dangerous.
It's insane.
We've gone over the plans with your deputies.
They're all on board.
- You've gone behind me?
- We knew this is how you'd react.
- Our children are here.
- Liz, we need to do this.
We have no choice.
This is the reason for the secret council.
Our founding fathers created the secret council for just this purpose.
I'm the sheriff and it's my call and I say no.
Richard, let me speak to the sheriff alone.
John, you're not thinking clearly.
I'm not gonna change my mind about this.
You're still around?
There's something you need to know.
The vampires from the tomb are planning an attack tonight.
- How do you know?
- I went to them.
They think I'm with them.
I'm not.
They want the founding families dead.
When is this supposed to happen?
When the fireworks start.
John Gilbert wants to use that invention on them.
- We can't be here.
- Doesn't work.
It's been deactivated.
- Then a lot of people are gonna die.
- Where are they right now?
They're already here, Damon.
Remember, we don't know which of them ingests vervain.
It's not about the feed.
It's about the kill.
You know what to do.
- Ric.
- Yeah.
Come here.
You keep those nifty vamp weapons in the car?
Yeah.
Why do you ask?
This square is crawling with tomb vampires.
We might need a stake or two.
- Yeah.
Got it.
- Go.
I know.
Can you imagine?
Hey.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Fifteen words or less, tomb vamps are here.
Founding families are the target.
- Get her out of here.
Now.
- Wait.
Where are you going?
- That's more than 15 words, Stefan.
- Wait.
Jeremy's out here.
Let's go find him.
Come on.
There was this time, freshman year when Bonnie and I were in a fight and we swore that we would never talk again.
Caroline, give it a rest.
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
I told you to go home.
- I decided not to.
- Lf I tell you to do something, you do it.
- Get off me.
- Mayor.
Is everything okay?
Please, Tyler.
I need you to go home.
Now.
- Take your friends with you.
- Wait.
Why?
What's going on?
I can't explain.
All of you need to get home now.
Please.
Yeah, okay.
Here.
Take my car.
It's out back.
Caroline, Matt, go with him.
Come on.
Anna, my uncle could see you.
I don't care about that.
I needed to find you.
Come here.
For 150 years Mystic Falls has been the kind of town that everybody wants to call home.
Safe, prosperous, welcoming.
And we have the founders to thank for that.
That's why I'd like to dedicate this evening's fireworks display to their legacy.
Get into position.
Enjoy the show.
Stay close, dear.
- Oh, sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
Do you have any idea what you've done?
Yes.
As a matter of fact, I do.
Stefan?
What's going on?
What's happening?
- My head.
- What?
My head.
Anna?
Anna, what's wrong?
Anna?
- Please make it stop.
- What's happening?
What the hell is that?
What's the matter?
- That noise.
- Wait.
What noise?
- Oh!
- Whoa.
- Tyler?
Tyler!
- Dude, hey!
- Caroline, the wheel!
- Tyler!
Hey.
I got this one.
There's another one over there.
Take this.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Get up.
- He just dropped.
- Yeah, he's not the only one.
Cops are grabbing everyone who's down.
Injecting vervain.
- What?
- Yeah.
They're rounding up the vampires.
Please help him.
He just went down.
Is that the mayor?
- Richard.
- Is he all right?
My head.
Jeremy.
Hey, I got one.
Hey, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?
Leave her alone.
- All right.
- What are you doing?
Leave her alone!
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
- Leave her alone!
Anna!
The device is done.
The only thing keeping them down is the vervain.
We don't have much time.
Let's finish this.
Anna.
You head up.
I'll take it from here.
Please.
No.
- You okay?
- It was like needles were piercing my skull.
And then it just stopped.
I saw at least five vampires go down.
They're taking them to your family's old building.
It's the Gilbert device.
It has to be.
But how did he get it to work?
Bonnie unspelled it.
Or maybe she didn't.
She did.
We saw her do it.
No.
He's right.
Think about it.
We asked Bonnie to deactivate a device that could protect people against vampires.
So we could protect you.
And Damon.
Vampires.
- Where's Damon?
- I don't know.
I haven't seen him since this started.
- Can you get my brother?
Take him home?
- Of course.
Let's go.
- Liz.
You okay?
What is going on?
- There's a key in my belt.
There's a key in my belt.
I need you to get it.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Something's happened to Richard.
- They took him.
- Who took him?
Your deputies.
I don't understand.
He's not a vampire.
Let's go.
Mayor.
- Is that you?
- What are you doing here?
I'm a vampire.
What is your excuse?
No, really.
The vervain didn't affect you.
You're not a vampire.
What the hell are you?
Mayor Lockwood.
You okay?
Your side took the biggest hit.
- I'm fine.
- No, they need to check you out.
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
They're helping Tyler.
Pulse is steadying.
All right.
What the hell?
What?
What's wrong?
The eyes.
- What happened?
- Dude, don't scare me like that.
Hey.
She needs some help over here.
Caroline.
- Over here.
Caroline.
- There.
Get that one.
Caroline, hey.
Wake up.
We're gonna get you home.
Wake up, Car.
Wait, wait, wait.
I can hear them.
- The building is on fire.
- What?
Building's on fire.
Where is Damon?
With the rest of them, where he should be.
It's over for Damon.
You're crazy.
Why?
Because I'm doing what should've been done 145 years ago?
This is the right thing, Elena.
Go ahead.
You won't make it out.
You'll save me the trouble of killing you myself.
You know the building well.
Is there another entrance in?
Utility door.
There's one around the side.
One more step and I'll alert those deputies they missed a vampire.
I'm asking you not to.
That doesn't mean anything to me.
As my father, it should.
You know.
I wasn't sure.
But now I am.
Hey!
You can't go in there.
The fire will take you out.
He's my brother, Bonnie.
Stefan!
- Elena, you can't go in there.
- Bonnie, what are you doing?
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I've gotta get in there.
Damon.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Bonnie.
Bonnie, what is it?
Are they gonna be okay?
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Two 10-45s will be treated at county...
The fire is out.
The story is that the building's old wiring is what caused it.
Did you see where Damon went?
No.
He just kind of disappeared.
Figures.
I'm so glad you're okay.
I try so hard to hate him.
I guess it's just pointless.
You care about him.
So do I.
But I love you, Stefan.
And I know that you're worried about that.
Well, I just...
You know, I know my brother.
But I love you, Stefan.
I know the trouble he can cause...
I love you, Stefan.
You.
You have nothing to worry about.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
So I...
Jenna called.
Jeremy is home.
I'm just gonna run over to the school to pick up my dress, my clothes, my stuff and then I'll check on him.
What are you doing here?
Anna's dead.
I figured that once they took her away.
I know you cared about her.
Yeah, I did.
I saw her killed.
I was watching and all I could think about was...
I wanted to help her.
But I couldn't.
Why are you telling me all this?
I took away your suffering once before.
I can do it again.
But it's your choice.
Look I know you think you took it away but it's still there.
Even if I can't remember why, I still feel empty.
Alone.
And making me forget won't fix it.
It won't fix what's really wrong.
What I did to Vicki was wrong.
Sorry for my part.
Anna said that vampires don't have to feel pain.
That they could turn it off if they shut out their humanity.
That's very true.
Is it easier that way?
Is what easier?
Life.
Life sucks either way, Jeremy.
If you're a vampire, you don't have to feel bad if you don't want to.
Is that what you did?
I did it for...
I did it for a very long time.
And life was a lot easier.
Hey, man.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I don't even know what happened.
It's okay, man.
She'll be all right.
What's happening?
She all right?
There was internal bleeding.
They're taking her into surgery.
What else did they say?
Is she gonna be okay?
They're gonna do everything they can.
Tyler, have you talked to your mom?
I left her a message telling her I was here.
You need to call her.
What is it?
It's your dad.
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.
- You just missed Elena.
- I was looking for you, actually.
Oh.
Elena is my best friend.
And because she loves you, I couldn't let you or Damon die in that fire.
I'm grateful, Bonnie.
I hope you know that.
I do.
But I hope you know that things have to change.
Damon has to change.
We both want the same thing.
We both wanna protect the people we care about.
The difference is, for you, Damon is one of them.
You saw what I was able to do tonight.
I know who I am now.
And if Damon spills so much as one drop of innocent blood I'll take him down.
Even if I have to take you with him.
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
Let's hope it doesn't.
What are you doing here?
A failed and feeble attempt at doing the right thing.
Which was?
It's not important.
Let me take this for you.
Thank you.
You know, I came in this town wanting to destroy it.
Tonight I found myself wanting to protect it.
How does that happen?
I'm not a hero, Elena.
I don't do good.
It's not in me.
Maybe it is.
No.
No, that's reserved for my brother and you and Bonnie.
Even though she has every reason to hate me, still helped Stefan save me.
Why do you sound so surprised?
She did it for you.
Which means somewhere along the way you decided that I was worth saving.
And I wanted to thank you for that.
You're welcome.
Hi.
It's late.
You should probably come inside.
What are you doing?
I don't wanna talk about it.
You scared me.
I'm sorry.
You know, I first met Isobel when I was a teenager.
I fell in love with her instantly, although I'm pretty sure she never loved me.
She was special.
Part of why I hate the vampires so much is because of what she became.
How it ruined her.
And I never would've sent her to Damon had I known she wanted to turn.
It's my fault.
I'm telling you this because I hope maybe you'd understand.
Thank you.
Can I help?
Sure.
Katherine?
Hello, John.
Goodbye, John.
I looked everywhere.
Yeah.
Someone definitely took my stuff.
I gotta check on Jeremy before I go to the hospital.
Can you meet me there?
Okay.
I love you, Stefan.
Jeremy?
Are you up?

Previously on The Vampire Diaries:
For over a century, I have lived in secret.
Until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
Elena, a dead ringer for Katherine.
- I want the invention.
- I don't have it.
But Damon does.
And you're gonna get it for me.
I'm not gonna give the device to Isobel so she can give it to John.
But it'll be useless.
Bonnie can take the spell off.
You took a risk with Damon.
How'd you know he would give it to me?
Because he's in love with you.
I couldn't do what she wanted me to do.
It wasn't right.
But when Elena finds out she's never gonna forgive me.
Ow.
This dress hurts.
Suck it in, baby.
Timberwolves!
Timberwolves!
Go Big Red!
No, no, no.
This lineup is all wrong.
The marching band is in front of the historical society.
Matt, time to get on your float.
Boys, I asked you to put the chairs on the Founder's float.
Ladies, time to get on your float.
Look at you, all retro.
- What are you doing here?
- Why wouldn't I be here?
Bonnie deactivated the Gilbert invention, Isobel's gone and it's Founder's Day.
I'm here to eat cotton candy and steal your girl.
- Don't start with me.
- Oh, you started it, Stefan with that whole "I'm insecure, leave Elena alone" speech.
I'm still enjoying that.
- As long as you heard it.
- Wait, huh?
What?
You have no sense of humor.
Actually, I just have no sense of Damon humor.
Damon humor?
Hey, look, I get it.
I get it.
I'm the better, hotter, superior choice and you're scared now that Katherine's out of the picture, I'm gonna turn to Elena.
But don't worry.
Elena is not Katherine.
You're right.
She's not.
Anna.
Look at you.
Heh.
I know, it's stupid, huh?
I'm part of the parade.
But how are you?
I've been so worried and I feel awful.
Why?
You didn't kill my mother.
Your uncle did.
Are you sure it was him?
Who else would've done it?
He doesn't understand, Anna.
It's who he is.
He hates all vampires.
He's just doing what he thinks is right.
Are you defending him?
No.
No way.
It's just...
I do understand where he's coming from.
He's convinced all the tomb vampires want revenge on this town and he's just...
He's trying to protect it.
They do want revenge.
Or at least they did.
But that's why we separated from them.
My mom wasn't after revenge.
She just wanted her life back.
I have to get out of this town, Jeremy.
You're leaving?
But I've been thinking, you could come.
I could turn you.
You said you wanted me to.
Here.
It's my blood.
If you die with it in your system, you'll come back.
- Anna...
- I know you.
What it's like for you.
Being alone, always feeling empty inside, no one to understand.
But when you're a vampire, you don't have to feel that way.
You can shut it off.
I can show you how.
I wanted to.
I did.
But I don't think I can.
I'm sorry.
John?
Is that even possible?
Well, there's no proof, but he dated Isobel when she was a teenager.
He brought her to your dad's office for the delivery.
My whole life I've never liked this man.
L...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I just...
Wanted to tell you before Damon dropped it on you in some inappropriate way.
No, I'm happy that you told me.
I just...
I really hope that it's not true.
What am I supposed to do?
Do I just confront him and say, "Are you my biological father?"
Well, I guess when you're ready.
I'm never gonna be ready.
Stefan, I have enough problems with the family that I actually care about.
Jeremy hates me.
And why wouldn't he?
My journal gave him every single reason to.
He's just hurt.
He's confused.
He's never gonna forgive me for Vicki.
For taking away his memory, for lying to him.
He's your brother.
He'll forgive you.
Just give him some time.
- Say cheese.
- Ooh, wait.
- Hide your cast.
It's not era-appropriate.
- Seriously?
- Yes.
- Okay.
All right.
Come here.
I want one with Bonnie.
- Okay.
- I can take it.
I'll be on the float.
I said I was sorry.
You made out with his mother and then you beat him to a pulp.
You're gonna have to do a little bit better than sorry.
Jeremy.
I was wondering where you were.
You look great.
- You guys did a really great job on the float.
- Go away, Elena.
Jeremy, please.
I don't want it to be like this between us.
Why don't you have Damon erase my memory again?
Then I could go back to being your in-the-dark brother.
- Jer, please.
- Just don't.
You can't fix this that easily.
Something like this doesn't just get fixed.
Let's give a big hand to the Mystic Falls High School Marching Band.
Yeah!
And for a little local history Mr. Saltzman's students have re-created Virginia's Battle of Willow Creek.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our stunning Miss Mystic Falls court and their handsome escorts.
This is Caroline Forbes, Miss Mystic Falls.
Aren't they beautiful?
What do you want?
Just watching the parade.
- Where you going?
- Away from you.
- I wanna say something.
- Leave me alone.
Thank you.
The device that Emily spelled could've killed me.
I don't take what you did lightly so thank you.
- I did it for Elena.
- I know that, but I'm still very grateful.
And I owe you.
Enjoy the parade.
Oh, there they are.
Look.
Let's cheer for the Mystic Falls High School football team.
All right.
Let's show them our support, everybody.
This is the key.
Once inserted, the device will be activated.
It will work only once for an estimated time of five minutes.
Yeah, so how does it work?
It's a high-pitched frequency that humans can't hear.
Any vampire within a five-block radius will be incapacitated, exposing them.
At that time, the sheriff's deputies will inject them with vervain and bring them here, where we'll finish them off.
- They're attacking tonight?
- I had a source.
One of the vampires from the tomb confirmed the attack.
Everybody listen up.
The plan stays the same.
We wait till the fireworks start.
Until then, we blend in.
Stay part of the celebration.
They'll never see us coming.
They want revenge for what our ancestors did in 1864.
Which makes us their targets.
This area here is the stage.
This is where the founding families are gonna be.
Any questions?
Taking an enormous risk.
Talking about our families, John.
Anna.
What are you doing here?
This is the only way.
Draw them out and kill them.
All of them.
I like you better like this.
Period look, it didn't suit you.
Is that an insult?
Actually, Elena, it is a compliment of the highest order.
Look, I know Stefan is worried about our friendship.
Did he mention something to you too?
- No.
Did he mention something to you?
- No.
Nothing worth repeating.
You should stop with the flirty comments and that eye thing that you do.
What eye thing?
Hm.
Don't make me regret being your friend.
Okay?
I don't believe that we can't fix this.
I lied.
I was wrong.
But you're my brother, Jer.
And I love you and I have to fix it.
So just tell me, what can I do?
You can go to hell, Elena.
I have so many emotions, but I don't have any way to express them.
- Being a teenager is so hard.
- Dick.
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm not your sister.
And from now on, don't talk to your sister that way either.
You're gonna kill me because I hurt Elena?
Cut her some slack.
- She erased my memories.
- No.
I did.
She was protecting you.
That wasn't her call to make.
- Let go before I cause a scene.
- You'd be unconscious before you even got a word out.
- Let him go.
You all right?
Yeah.
What my brother is trying to say is don't blame Elena for this.
Damon turned Vicki.
I killed her.
She was a threat to you and she was a threat to your sister.
I'm sorry that it happened.
I wish that it hadn't.
Shouldn't have made me forget.
- Good cop, bad cop.
I like it.
- What are you doing?
- He was a punk.
- Elena's relationship with her brother is none of your business.
Stay out of it.
- There's only one do-gooder role available.
Oh, my bad.
I'm sorry.
We both know you're not doing this for the right reasons.
See?
There you go with that little jealousy act again.
It just...
What are the right reasons, Stefan?
- Enlighten me, please.
- See, Damon it's only real when it comes from your desire to do the right thing.
For nothing in return.
- Right.
- And I know that is an entirely foreign concept to you.
I completely understand how you wouldn't get it.
You wanna use our town as bait?
It's too dangerous.
It's insane.
We've gone over the plans with your deputies.
They're all on board.
- You've gone behind me?
- We knew this is how you'd react.
- Our children are here.
- Liz, we need to do this.
We have no choice.
This is the reason for the secret council.
Our founding fathers created the secret council for just this purpose.
I'm the sheriff and it's my call and I say no.
Richard, let me speak to the sheriff alone.
John, you're not thinking clearly.
I'm not gonna change my mind about this.
You're still around?
There's something you need to know.
The vampires from the tomb are planning an attack tonight.
- How do you know?
- I went to them.
They think I'm with them.
I'm not.
They want the founding families dead.
When is this supposed to happen?
When the fireworks start.
John Gilbert wants to use that invention on them.
- We can't be here.
- Doesn't work.
It's been deactivated.
- Then a lot of people are gonna die.
- Where are they right now?
They're already here, Damon.
Remember, we don't know which of them ingests vervain.
It's not about the feed.
It's about the kill.
You know what to do.
- Ric.
- Yeah.
Come here.
You keep those nifty vamp weapons in the car?
Yeah.
Why do you ask?
This square is crawling with tomb vampires.
We might need a stake or two.
- Yeah.
Got it.
- Go.
I know.
Can you imagine?
Hey.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Fifteen words or less, tomb vamps are here.
Founding families are the target.
- Get her out of here.
Now.
- Wait.
Where are you going?
- That's more than 15 words, Stefan.

Jeremy's out here.
Let's go find him.
Come on.
There was this time, freshman year when Bonnie and I were in a fight and we swore that we would never talk again.
Caroline, give it a rest.
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
I told you to go home.
- I decided not to.
- Lf I tell you to do something, you do it.
- Get off me.
- Mayor.
Is everything okay?
Please, Tyler.
I need you to go home.
Now.
- Take your friends with you.
- Wait.
Why?
What's going on?
I can't explain.
All of you need to get home now.
Please.
Yeah, okay.
Here.
Take my car.
It's out back.
Caroline, Matt, go with him.
Come on.
Anna, my uncle could see you.
I don't care about that.
I needed to find you.
Come here.
For 150 years Mystic Falls has been the kind of town that everybody wants to call home.
Safe, prosperous, welcoming.
And we have the founders to thank for that.
That's why I'd like to dedicate this evening's fireworks display to their legacy.

Do you have any idea what you've done?
Yes.

Stefan?
What's going on?
What's happening?
- My head.
- What?
My head.
Anna?
Anna, what's wrong?
Anna?
- Please make it stop.
- What's happening?
What the hell is that?
What's the matter?

There's another one over there.
Take this.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Get up.
- He just dropped.
- Yeah, he's not the only one.
Cops are grabbing everyone who's down.
Injecting vervain.
- What?
- Yeah.
They're rounding up the vampires.
Please help him.
He just went down.
Is that the mayor?
- Richard.
- Is he all right?
My head.
Jeremy.
Hey, I got one.
Hey, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?
Leave her alone.
- All right.
- What are you doing?
Leave her alone!
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
- Leave her alone!
Anna!
The device is done.
The only thing keeping them down is the vervain.
We don't have much time.
Let's finish this.
Anna.
You head up.
I'll take it from here.
Please.
No.
- You okay?
- It was like needles were piercing my skull.
And then it just stopped.
I saw at least five vampires go down.
They're taking them to your family's old building.
It's the Gilbert device.
It has to be.
But how did he get it to work?
Bonnie unspelled it.
Or maybe she didn't.
She did.
We saw her do it.
No.
He's right.
Think about it.
We asked Bonnie to deactivate a device that could protect people against vampires.
So we could protect you.
And Damon.
Vampires.
- Where's Damon?
- I don't know.
I haven't seen him since this started.
- Can you get my brother?
Take him home?
- Of course.
Let's go.
- Liz.
You okay?
What is going on?
- There's a key in my belt.
There's a key in my belt.
I need you to get it.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Something's happened to Richard.
- They took him.
- Who took him?
Your deputies.
I don't understand.
He's not a vampire.
Let's go.
Mayor.
- Is that you?
- What are you doing here?
I'm a vampire.
What is your excuse?
No, really.
The vervain didn't affect you.
You're not a vampire.
What the hell are you?
Mayor Lockwood.
You okay?
Your side took the biggest hit.
- I'm fine.
- No, they need to check you out.
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
They're helping Tyler.
Pulse is steadying.
All right.
What the hell?
What?
What's wrong?
The eyes.
- What happened?
- Dude, don't scare me like that.
Hey.
She needs some help over here.
Caroline.
- Over here.
Caroline.
- There.
Get that one.
Caroline, hey.
Wake up.
We're gonna get you home.
Wake up, Car.
Wait, wait, wait.
I can hear them.
- The building is on fire.
- What?
Building's on fire.
Where is Damon?
With the rest of them, where he should be.
It's over for Damon.
You're crazy.
Why?
Because I'm doing what should've been done 145 years ago?
This is the right thing, Elena.
Go ahead.
You won't make it out.
You'll save me the trouble of killing you myself.
You know the building well.
Is there another entrance in?
Utility door.
There's one around the side.
One more step and I'll alert those deputies they missed a vampire.
I'm asking you not to.
That doesn't mean anything to me.
As my father, it should.
You know.
I wasn't sure.
But now I am.
Hey!
You can't go in there.
The fire will take you out.
He's my brother, Bonnie.
Stefan!
- Elena, you can't go in there.
- Bonnie, what are you doing?
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I've gotta get in there.
Damon.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Bonnie.
Bonnie, what is it?
Are they gonna be okay?
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Two 10-45s will be treated at county...
The fire is out.
The story is that the building's old wiring is what caused it.
Did you see where Damon went?
No.
He just kind of disappeared.
Figures.
I'm so glad you're okay.
I try so hard to hate him.
I guess it's just pointless.
You care about him.
So do I.
But I love you, Stefan.
And I know that you're worried about that.
Well, I just...
You know, I know my brother.
But I love you, Stefan.
I know the trouble he can cause...
I love you, Stefan.
You.
You have nothing to worry about.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
So I...
Jenna called.
Jeremy is home.
I'm just gonna run over to the school to pick up my dress, my clothes, my stuff and then I'll check on him.
What are you doing here?
Anna's dead.
I figured that once they took her away.
I know you cared about her.
Yeah, I did.
I saw her killed.
I was watching and all I could think about was...
I wanted to help her.
But I couldn't.
Why are you telling me all this?
I took away your suffering once before.
I can do it again.
But it's your choice.
Look I know you think you took it away but it's still there.
Even if I can't remember why, I still feel empty.
Alone.
And making me forget won't fix it.
It won't fix what's really wrong.
What I did to Vicki was wrong.
Sorry for my part.
Anna said that vampires don't have to feel pain.
That they could turn it off if they shut out their humanity.
That's very true.
Is it easier that way?
Is what easier?
Life.
Life sucks either way, Jeremy.
If you're a vampire, you don't have to feel bad if you don't want to.
Is that what you did?
I did it for...
I did it for a very long time.
And life was a lot easier.
Hey, man.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I don't even know what happened.
It's okay, man.
She'll be all right.
What's happening?
She all right?
There was internal bleeding.
They're taking her into surgery.
What else did they say?
Is she gonna be okay?
They're gonna do everything they can.
Tyler, have you talked to your mom?
I left her a message telling her I was here.
You need to call her.
What is it?
It's your dad.
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.
- You just missed Elena.
- I was looking for you, actually.
Oh.
Elena is my best friend.
And because she loves you, I couldn't let you or Damon die in that fire.
I'm grateful, Bonnie.
I hope you know that.
I do.
But I hope you know that things have to change.
Damon has to change.
We both want the same thing.
We both wanna protect the people we care about.
The difference is, for you, Damon is one of them.
You saw what I was able to do tonight.
I know who I am now.
And if Damon spills so much as one drop of innocent blood I'll take him down.
Even if I have to take you with him.
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
Let's hope it doesn't.
What are you doing here?
A failed and feeble attempt at doing the right thing.
Which was?
It's not important.
Let me take this for you.
Thank you.
You know, I came in this town wanting to destroy it.
Tonight I found myself wanting to protect it.
How does that happen?
I'm not a hero, Elena.
I don't do good.
It's not in me.
Maybe it is.
No.
No, that's reserved for my brother and you and Bonnie.
Even though she has every reason to hate me, still helped Stefan save me.
Why do you sound so surprised?
She did it for you.
Which means somewhere along the way you decided that I was worth saving.
And I wanted to thank you for that.
You're welcome.
Hi.
It's late.
You should probably come inside.
What are you doing?
I don't wanna talk about it.
You scared me.
I'm sorry.
You know, I first met Isobel when I was a teenager.
I fell in love with her instantly, although I'm pretty sure she never loved me.
She was special.
Part of why I hate the vampires so much is because of what she became.
How it ruined her.
And I never would've sent her to Damon had I known she wanted to turn.
It's my fault.
I'm telling you this because I hope maybe you'd understand.
Thank you.
Can I help?
Sure.
Katherine?
Hello, John.
Goodbye, John.
I looked everywhere.
Yeah.
Someone definitely took my stuff.
I gotta check on Jeremy before I go to the hospital.
Can you meet me there?
Okay.
I love you, Stefan.
Jeremy?
Are you up?

RADIO STOPS
Of course you're envious of him.
No, I'm not.
Not really.
I don't blame you, he's on TV all the time.
I'm fed up and I wasn't at college with him.
I'm not jealous.
You hate him and that's fine.
He's clearly desperate to be Mr Pointy Head, the Bishop.
Mind you, he was bloody funny on Graham Norton.
He was always "not" drinking at the right parties and chatting up the Bishop of London.
"Oh, ho, ho, Richard, you must come over some time and I'll dribble all over you."
You're not like that, thank God.
That's why I love you.
No.
You're doing what you were called to do with integrity for the parishioners, without all that Church manoeuvring and media stuff.
Yes, I could be doing it, choose not to.
Stephen Warwick works on The One Show.
Oh, darling, please don't try and get on The One Show.
No, I'm not, but it would get me noticed by the Bishop.
Oh, look.
Christ!
I'm sure there'll be a naked centrefold of him in it next week.
DOORBELL RINGS Hello, Colin.
Hello?
What's crackalacking, Vicar?
Hello, Mick.
Your Worship.
Yeah, yeah.
See, what it is, yeah, I got a new job now.
I'm a cycle courier, but my bike just got nicked, I can't believe it.
No, neither can I, you're a cycle courier?
Yeah, yeah.
I left it outside the pub for like two minutes, it's gone.
People are scum, man.
So I need to get to Southend, so I can borrow my brother's bike and I was just hoping you could lend me a lickle train fare so I could get there, get to work and do my day's work.
Right, thing is, I don't normally give out money.
Ah, no, Vicar!
You can't be tight, you've got to lend me, what you...
Eee, easy, Mrs Vicar.
Morning.
Eh, morning.
This man's after a train fare to Southend so he can work.
I'm off to the station now, so if you come with me, I'll make sure you get a ticket.
Nah, there's no need for that.
Yes, there is.
Come on.
Come along.
Woman, just leave me alone!
I'm being kidnapped, kidnapping me!
Oh, shush.
I hope you'll be along for the first of my Singles Only Suppers.
SOS I'm calling them.
OK, when is it?
Monday the 15th.
I have told you, Adam, it is in the diary.
Yes, OK, I'll come.
Good.
Confirmed.
I think the six o'clock suppers will be more of a success than breakfast.
A lot of the men are depressed, not very good at getting up.
Now, I need some new vestments.
My predecessor Poped off with all the good tat.
Father Winters at St Clems has a magnificent chasuble - gothic, gold and red, he looks majestic.
No, he doesn't!
He looks like Dumbledore with his huge flappy wizard sleeves.
Oh, look at her.
I've got that shirt, actually, in, er, mint green.
Well, I think I'll stick with the black.
Did you see Roland Wise's article in the Telegraph today?
Very interesting on the subject of Syriac liturgy of the 3rd century, I thought.
Oh, don't you start, I've already had him in bed with me this morning.
Hello, Colin.
We missed you at prayer this morning.
Yeah, sorry, Vicarage.
I and I met this fascinating man who's uplifted me.
He was playing bongos outside the offy.
He called Lionpaw, he's a Rastafari.
Oh, right, I see.
Ah, why do people put it in a bag and then leave it like it's a gift?
HE SIGHS
Rasta's a great religion, innit, Adam?
It's like Christianity, but you get to smoke this.
Do you want some?
No, thanks, Colin.
I'm not sure you should be smoking it either.
It's not doing drugs.
It's spiritual, it'll cleanse your soul.
It's cleansing mine right now.
So have we lost you at this Church, then, Colin?
Oh, no, I can be a Rastafari at any Church.
It's great.
And I'm healthy, thanks to Lionpaw.
Hold that, I'm just going for a piss.
I've given up booze, processed food and shell fish.
How's that going?
I haven't had any shell fish today.
Ah, there you are.
Oh, hello, Archdeacon.
I was just talking to...
Have you met Colin?
One of our regulars?
SPLASHING Hello!
I'll just leave your thing here, Colin.
So, why exactly am I here?
I just wanted to let you know some of my plans for St Saviours.
I want to get your approval.
Fine, I have to be at Broadcasting House for 2.
Roland Wise is doing Just a Minute.
Do you know Roland?
No.
Here you go, Adam.
On the house, a pint of the usual.
Oh, er, no, thank you, Gemma.
You know I don't normally drink.
He's sticking with the Class B drugs.
STILTED LAUGHTER
One of the things I'm very keen to do is make sure that St Saviours is a place where we ask some serious, challenging questions.
Won't that scare off your congregation?
Some of the more Churchy ones, maybe, but I don't see it as the Church's role to resolve issues for our congregation, but rather to deepen them.
You want to deepen issues?
Yes, I...
Yes, I want to be a man with a message.
What is your message?
Well, it's still the Christian message, based on the Gospels.
It is beautiful, but it is also quite complicated.
Mmm, I tend to find congregations prefer cornflakes to muesli, theologically speaking.
What else?
And I want to move coffee out of the vestry into the nave, so that we can accommodate more people.
Ah, well, here's a tip, buy a Cappuccino machine.
That way I think more people will come.
The stuff you serve is muck.
Thank you, er, it's a good idea.
I suppose that all sounds quite good, Adam.
Does it?
Yes.
Good.
You're new in London, you want to make a mark, I understand.
There are 10,000 vicars and only 350 top jobs, so, er...
Let me crack open one of the myths of the Church for you.
Despite what everyone tells you, the chances of promotion in the Church of England are about the same as in... the Chinese Army.
Two cappuccinos.
Who, who ordered the macchiatos?
I did, it was me.
Quiet yourself, please, don't push!
Adam's ordered some new church vestments, an emerald chasuble.
Yes, where are they?
They should have arrived by now.
He spent a fortune on a holy poncho!
LAUGHTER
Hello, Stephen, how lovely to see you.
Hi, Sarah.
Hello, Ellie.
You look lovely.
That's a love...
That's a gorgeous...necklace.
Great coffee, Adam.
Is it?
Very nice.
What's happened?
I'll have to do my staff meetings here.
Ha!
Well, you're always very welcome, Ellie, you know that.
Is there a loyalty card?
Ten crucifix coffee stamps gets you into Heaven?
I should do that!
Though I'm sure you're going to Heaven anyway, Ellie.
Excuse me.
Adam, have you had a chance to think about whether I can use the Church for Phoebe's birthday party?
I'm very happy to help, Stephen.
Are you still working for the BBC?
Yeah, The One Show.
Is that a magazine programme?
SOS it's called, it's a chance for lonely men to get together to discuss their problems over a light supper.
I think you'd fit in.
That is a great idea.
Is it?
Yeah.
Great.
How exciting.
I shall prepare some sound bites!
Yeah, right, yeah.
Ahem...
How do I look?
Lovely.
Authoritative but dashing?
Serious but fun?
You look all of those things.
Car'll be here any minute.
Should I have a drink to calm my nerves?
I will be, a large one.
TELEPHONE RINGS
Hello?
Oh, Nigel.
Tonight, is it, your singles thing?
Yeah, no, I can't possibly come, I'm afraid.
Because I've been invited to appear on national television. ..
BBC One.
The One Show.
It's a flagship show, it gets seven million viewers.
Nigel, I've got to go, the limousine's just arrived.
OK, here we go, it's five...
Four, three, two, one.
MUSIC:
Theme from "The One Show"
DIRECTOR SHOUTS ORDERS Look at five now.
Hello, welcome to the One Show with Christine Bleakley.
And Adrian Chiles.
Shrove Tuesday tomorrow.
From St Saviours in East London, the Reverend Adam Smallbone!
APPLAUSE AND CHEERS Um, yes, the word "shrove"
actually derives from the Medieval word "shrive", meaning to confess.
It's a kind of final fling before 40 days of penance in Lent.
It's actually 46 days to be precise, if you count the Sundays...
Thank you very much, Adam, more of that soon.
And pancakes too, hopefully.
Also with us is Craig Bishop from the ABBA Fan Club.
Hiya!
Yes!
CHEERING
Oh, yes!
Craig is going to be talking to us about the new ABBA Museum that's opening in Bedford.
Are you ABBA fans in the Church, Adam?
But you like your dressing up and stuff, don't you?
Well, yes...
No, we're all completely gay in the Church.
Can I just say, of course, we're not all gay in the Church.
Um, I'm married for one and, er, but equally, er, we're very accepting of homosexuals now.
But, um, as a point of fact, there's a supper for, for gay men going on in, in my Church right now.
Let's not watch it again.
To me, that's clearly just a joke, no-one will mind.
MOBILE PHONES BEEP Yes, they will, this is the Church, you can't say anything.
Everyone, stop texting!
I thought no-one watched this show.
Look, you're on YouTube. 163 hits.
You're the Susan Boyle of Vicars.
We're all gay in the Church, are we, Adam?
So are you gay, Adam?
No!
Of course...
It was just a light-hearted remark.
There's nothing wrong with being gay in the Church, is there?
Or anywhere.
You were just trying to get ahead, I understand.
I'm not trying to get ahead.
I don't discourage it.
But if you are going to do more of this, I suggest a little training.
I don't want to do more.
I know just the man.
I'll send Roland Wise your way.
Do you know him?
I was at college with Roland.
Well, then you know, he's wonderful!
Highly intelligent, authoritative and very funny.
He is funny, incredibly funny man.
Do you like him?
Yes, I love him.
Great!
I'll get Rolly to come over and see you.
Stay off the telly till then, yes?
And the radio and no talking to journalists.
Thanks for the coffee.
Good morning.
Well, I think it's all too clear why you didn't want to be at my singles supper.
I didn't have you down as homophobic, Adam.
I'm not.
We sat watching you on telly with charcuterie on our laps and our mouths wide open as you labelled the lot of us as gay!
Some of these men are married, Adam.
Then why are they at a singles night?
Everyone knows it's a gay thing.
They do not!
It is not just that!
Derek for one is straight, but lonely.
Now everyone thinks he's gay, but lonely.
OK, look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, I was under pressure.
The point I was trying to make is that the Church is not homophobic and neither am I. Really?
This pile of emails is people who think you are and are a disgrace!
This pile is from people who think you condone homosexuality and are a disgrace!
And this is from an ABBA fan who thinks you are stupid!
You have a very angry parish, Adam.
OK, fine!
Now, can we please talk about something else?
Like where are our new vestments, for instance?
I checked, they got delivered to Number 37 by mistake.
OK.
Anything else?
Adoha phoned, she wanted to know if you're having a nervous breakdown.
Ooh...
Roland's not vegetarian, is he?
Er, I don't know, I don't think so.
I had that terrible Cell Group weekend with him in Wales when it sheeted rain.
Four competitive young curates locked in a National Trust cottage playing Christian Top Trumps.
It was like a horrific social experiment.
God, sounds psychotic, like a Charles Manson retreat.
Yes, but with sociological thought instead of LSD and group sex.
It was the worst weekend of my life.
DOORBELL RINGS Oh, bollocks, that'll be him.
Ah, Vicarage, what's happening?
I've got a guest coming, so this is not ideal.
What isn't?
This moment?
Lionpaw said that your Church nicked St Luke's Gospel and haven't given it back, which is disgusting of you.
I'm not sure that's true.
Lionpaw said you would say that, cos you is one of the Babylon.
I haven't got time for this now, OK?
I'm sure Rastas are nice, but I don't share their interpretation of the Bible.
I don't think Haile Selassie was divine and only quite like Bob Marley.
Sorry, but Roland Wise from the TV will be here any moment.
Embrace the One Love, Adam, or I'll deck you.
OK, can we do that tomorrow instead?
DOORBELL RINGS AGAIN
That'll be Roland.
Vicar, can I use your toilet?
It's urgent.
Really, really urgent.
Um...
Please, it's urgent!
My guts are shot at the best of times!
I had a kebab, it's gone straight through me.
Can you use the pub?
There's no time!
I'm shaking here, man!
I'm touching cloth, man.
Come on, it's Defcon one down there...
Er, no, I'm afraid you'll have to use the pub.
Oh, man, oh...
It's Roland, he's here.
He's arriving, he's here.
He's here.
DOORBELL RINGS
Hello, Roland.
HE LAUGHS Here's the modern man.
Look at you, all moved up to London.
Dear boy, I hope I'm not late.
No, no.
Oh.
Oh.
Ah...
Are you aware there's a man defecating on your lawn?
Nearlydone,Vic...
Ahh ,man !
My TV appearance seems to have disgruntled quite a lot of people.
Mmm, the thing is, you've got to get straight back on the horse.
Win everyone round by doing something brilliant on Radio Four.
Do you want me to get you on Thought for the Day?
Could you do that?
Oh, they do what I tell them.
Thank you.
Is that a good idea?
It's an extremely good idea.
OK, um, thanks, well, what would I say?
Well, it needs to be something from the heart.
Something, er, intensely personal, er, sincere, authoritative.
Godly, humane, wise...
and funny.
Ha-ha!
Right, you can do that, can't you, darling?
No pressure(!
)
Maybe I could use that Louis MacNiece poem I love.
Oh, good idea.
It's about the importance of all the small daily unnoticed acts of kindness and creativity.
It's his favourite.
Never used it as the basis of a sermon.
I suppose in a strange way I was holding it back for a time like this.
Great, use it.
I'll fix it.
Alex, this is absolutely magnificent arrabbiata.
It reminds me of a dish I once ate on Lebdevev's yacht in Portofino.
Oh!
Thank you, Roland.
May I say how much I enjoyed you on Have I Got News For You?
Thank you.
Yes, it's a fun show...
Adam, would you like to know how to overcome your nerves on live radio?
Mm, well, yes, you're, you're so experienced.
What I do is, I look at the microphone and...
I imagine all the people listening and then...
I despise them.
I remind myself what a herd of stupid, ignorant, uneducated, graceless,
E number-chomping plebeians they all are, desperately seeking some form of guidance in their sad little...
fruitless lives.
Like when you do a sermon.
Some more cheese, Vicar?
C'est sufit, merci.
Um, would you like me to call you a cab, Roland?
No, no, a couple more drinks.
Is that whisky?
Er, oh, yeah.
I'm going to go to bed.
Really, darling?
Um, goodbye, Roland.
Have fun.
Oh, goodnight, dear lady.
Hm, mmm, thank you.
Bon nuit.
Guten nacht...
Ha-ha!
Alexandra is wonderful, you do know that?
Yes.
Yeah, I'm very lucky.
Yes, you are.
Very lucky... to have her... here in this lovely home.
And you're just so happy... ..with your wife...
..and your Church...
I'm sorry, Adam.
No, Roland, I...
You've made me realise I...
I can't remember why I got ordained any more.
I can't.
Why do I go on telly?
I tell you why!
Because I can't say no, that's why.
Because I have to please everyone!
That's all I am - I'm just a court jester!
No, no, no, no.
Yeah.
No, no, no, no.
Yes!
You are a, a proper priest and I'm just a...
A Godless, shitting empty priest with, with no thought or, or purpose or ministry.
HE SOBS
Do you remember that weekend we spent in Wales?
That was great, wasn't it?
Yes.
But that's the last time I think I was happy.
Roland, please.
You are a great priest.
In...intelligent, quite funny.
You've just lost your way for a moment.
That's all.
It happens to everyone.
Tomorrow morning, you and I are going to go to the Church, first thing, and we are going to say the Morning Office together, just you and I.
And we will reflect on our calling as priests.
Can I have another?
Yes, yes, of course.
# Many rivers to cross
# But I can't seem to find
# My way over
# Many rivers to cross... #
Mind the dog poo.
# But just where to begin
# I'm playing for time... #
BOTH:
Amen.
"You can hear the birds.
"A cloud of witnesses to whom, to what." That's how that poem starts.
"To all the things that will not notice when we die,
"yet lend the passing moment words and wings."
You know, Roland, I used to be so jealous of you.
I know you did.
It's OK, a lot of people are.
It's made me very lonely.
That's better.
Is this number 37?
Hello?
Hello?
Excuse me.
Oh, hello.
Hi.
How are you?
Um, I think some vestments might have got delivered here.
Paw!
Hello.
I'm Father Smallbone from St Saviours.
I don't shake hand, man.
Oh, OK.
It's a white man gesture for trickery.
I'm Lionpaw.
Oh, you're Lionpaw?
Hi.
Well, nice to meet you.
Um, Lionpaw, I think some vestments I ordered might have got delivered here by mistake.
Some what-ments?
Some vestments.
Um, that's them, actually.
That's my chasuble.
You're, you're wearing it.
A chasubles?
!
What you chatting 'bout, man?
Well, I'm chatting that!
Er, that's it!
And that's my stole.
You're wearing it wrong.
The stole goes under the chasuble and you've got the colours mixed up.
This is yours?
Er, yeah, yes.
I thought it was a gift from Jah man, you know.
Is our colours, bredda.
Can't we share them?
Er, no, because...
Well, actually, they're not really mine to lend.
They aren't yours?
No.
Well, they are, and they aren't.
You see, the thing is, I used Church funds to buy them, so technically, they belong to St Saviours in the Marshes down the road.
It's quite complicated, I know, but...
Why are you so vexed, tiny, tiny vicar man?
It's just clothes, you know?
It's all just vanity.
Yes, it's not just vanity, because they, they cost me, um, the Church 900 quid, so could I just have them back, please?
You can borrow them anytime you want.
Chill, bredda.
Don't tell me to chill!
You bloody chill!
Hello, Vicarage.
Been in for a bit of the old cleansing, eh?
Your bloody friend Lion Breath has nicked my vestments, Colin.
Has he?
Oh, don't worry about it.

# One love

# Let's get together and feel all right... #
I understand, Hotch.
Take all the time you need.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll be fine.
Okay.
You, too.
Hi.
I was hoping I could get a minute.
Agent Seaver has requested her remedial training be here.
She was only cleared for one case.
That didn't end the way she had hoped.
I'd say.
She made a mistake.
But she remained calm under pressure.
She just wants to prove herself.
Hotch isn't here to supervise her.
I'll do it.
I'll be her training agent.
He signed off?
Via email.
But I know you have a history with her.
Don't make me regret this.
Thank you.
Ma'am.
Agent.
Have you heard from Aaron?
He sounds like he hadn't slept.
Do you think he's all right?
Jack's having some problems.
Well, it's been a year since...
Well, I'm glad he's finally taking some time off.
This is the only thing that's pending.
Donald Sanderson?
That was 20 years ago.
25, actually.
He's up for parole.
They've asked us to do a risk assessment.
Well, I can't do it, not with Aaron gone.
Well, who can?
Morgan, can you come in here?
Well, he's he's got to meet him today.
The parole board hearing is tomorrow.
Now, what was his story?
Junkies randomly attacked his family?
Yes, that's what he claimed.
He and his son survived.
Frankly, I don't understand how parole is even a consideration.
Well, he's eligible.
They're overcrowded.
Yes, but the physical evidence was shocking.
Who could possibly believe he would be innocent?
That's not our job.
All we need to see is how 25 years has changed his life.
Ma'am.
Is everything all right?
I need you to take a trip.
Who's this?
Don Sanderson.
He's been in Petersburg half his life and he's up for parole.
It appears he's become a model prisoner.
You don't sound convinced.
I don't know how someone who kills his wife and daughter can be rehabilitated.
Open 7.
On the gate.
SSA Derek Morgan.
BAU.
You analyze behavior.
Close it.
Nobody's ever believed that I'm innocent.
Why would you?
- May I?
- Yeah.
I don't rely solely on physical evidence.
It says here that you were two years into your residency when all this happened.
What did you want to specialize in?
Pediatrics.
You haven't requested parole in over 18 years.
The system put me in here.
They're gonna keep me in here.
Time's gone by a little faster since I accepted that.
Has the heroin helped you pass the time?
They found it in your cell two years ago.
New regime had to assert power.
You're saying someone planted it.
Oh.
It is what it is.
You hadn't been in solitary since you got here.
Gave me a lot of time to think about my son.
Your son's name is Joshua?
I'm sorry.
I still don't understand how... how you're... gonna ignore all that evidence.
The prosecution said that I had an acute psychological break, that I was a psychopath.
Is that what you see?
Psychopaths are masters at hiding what's inside of them.
Is that what you think I've done?
Agent, do you have any idea what it's like to be accused of something that you didn't do?
You went to the infirmary 16 times, and not once did you ever try to fight back.
No.
The last time they beat me, they... well...
I...
I almost had it.
I mean, I didn't think that I was gonna make it.
And I was okay with that.
But I was lying there... and I had this, uh... vision.
See, Joshua was, uh... was grown up.
The sun was shining on us.
I...
I don't know where we were.
But I got to tell him that I didn't hurt our family.
And that's what's kept you going?
I thought just didn't want to feel sorry for myself.
I wanted...
I wanted to...
to live my life in here the way that I would have lived it out there and do things that I got cheated out of with Joshua.
Is that why you've taught men how to read?
Why you started a mentor program?
You've helped... 41 inmates get their GED.
Mr. Sanderson, this is the type of evidence I consider.
If you were to gain your freedom, what would you do with it?
I can't even think about something like that.
But what would you do?
I would try and find my son.
And I'd tell him the truth.
Based on physical evidence,
Don Sanderson has been prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
But the way in which he has spent the last 25 years... it throws doubt on that conviction.
Now, I know that is not the question at hand here today.
I have learned that behavior does not lie.
You all want to know whether or not this man has been reformed.
I believe that he has.
He's lost everything, yet somehow he has still managed to better himself.
More importantly, the people around him.
He's held on to the only good thing left in his life... his son.
It's what defines him.
At this point, he's simply looking ahead.
Therefore, it is my belief that Don Sanderson is not a danger to himself or to society.
Goodbye, now.
I, uh, noticed you all drink double shots.
Oh, thanks.
You do, too?
This is a first.
I wanted to thank you for having my back.
I hope you have mine.
Front page news, huh?
Morgan must not think he did it.
Or believes he won't do it again.
Is Agent Morgan in?
What do you need, Erin?
Metro P.D. Sent this an hour ago.
And they want us to take a look?
No, they want you to take a look.
Who's this?
The man Don Sanderson just murdered.
There is no such thing as part freedom.
Nelson Mandela.
Why didn't Sanderson just run?
Maybe he wanted to go back to prison.
There are plenty of ways to violate your parole other than homicide.
- Is Morgan okay?
- He just vouched for a man that turned around and killed someone.
So he's the one who let him out?
Come on, Bill, you know it's never that simple.
Oh, you see this all the time, Rossi.
Guy's out for a couple of days, he's gotta get back inside.
They why did he claim self-defense?
Why call the paramedics?
Why attempt CPR to keep him breathing?
Why not just flee the scene?
He wanted something else.
Like what?
I don't know yet.
Well, he's predictable, if you ask me.
He broke into this guy's basement and stabbed him, same way he did his wife.
Rossi, he's coming with us.
Get out of the car.
Let's go, move.
You're welcome to join us.
After I clean up here.
This is not a random act of violence.
There has to be a reason.
Anything could have been a weapon.
So he chose to stab him, just like he did before.
Hello, Tommy.
Aah!
So he dialed 911, then he performed CPR.
Why go through this big fight and then try and save him?
So the gun wasn't loaded, but he broke in, took it, and waited for Wittman to get home?
Why?
I don't know, love, but I do know that your victim legally purchased that.38 in '94, licensed to him.
Other than that, no weapons, wives, or children.
The guy was pretty much a loner.
So there's gotta be some sort of connection.
There isn't any yet.
I'm sorry.
All right.
Thank you, Garcia.
Yeah, hey, how is my boy?
Uh, fine.
Really?
No.
Oh.
The bullets were in the other room, but the gun is right here.
Maybe killing him was an accident?
Does any of this strike you as hard to believe?
Neighbors confirmed hearing sounds of a confrontation.
Yeah, but Sanderson was out of prison for what, Reid?
At the time of the murder, 51 hours.
He's free for two days and change?
What's the big hurry to find this guy?
You woke up a free man and decided to kill Tom Wittman.
You gotta help us out here.
It doesn't look good for you.
It wasn't supposed to be like that.
He came at me.
I get it that you don't trust anyone right now, but this man is the reason that you're free.
Did you find your son?
No.
Did you even look?
Drive.
How is he?
Clearing his head.
Strauss is waiting for you guys to come back.
Great.
That's all he needs.
We still don't know how Tom Wittman is connected to Don Sanderson.
All we know about him is everything Morgan went over, what he was accused of.
And that he killed Tom Whitman this morning.
The guy's not talking.
He doesn't trust anybody.
If he doesn't tell us who Tom Wittman is, how are we going to help Derek?
The answer's in there somewhere.
We just have to find it.
All right, March 10, 1985, 2:23 a.m.
Don Sanderson was asleep on his couch because of an argument he had with his wife.
He woke up to her screams.
He ran to the bedroom to find one man stabbing her.
Another man struck him from behind, knocking him unconscious.
His wounds were superficial in comparison, so it was easy for the prosecution to claim that Sanderson's wounds were self-inflicted.
And he had just finished his second year of residency at Georgetown, indicating he had the skills to do it to himself.
And his fingerprints were all over the weapon.
So Sanderson comes to.
His wife and daughter are dead.
Almost dead.
He called for help.
Sounds familiar.
He said that two men killed his wife, but when officers arrived, he changed his story.
He added a woman.
Let me guess.
They never found her.
No one ever looked.
So wait, three people commit a brutal double homicide, then never act on it again?
I don't know, it seems unlikely.
But nothing like that ever happened after Sanderson went to prison.
The question is, how does Tom Wittman play into this?
He was a teenager at the time.
Strauss.
I want everything from Tom Wittman's apartment.
It's on its way.
Do you think Wittman was there that night?
- That depends.
- On what?
If you believe Sanderson's story.
My office will handle the press from here on.
That's unnecessary.
You don't need any more distractions.
He looks genuinely distraught.
He's very convincing.
I can see why you fell for it.
I don't need to remind you that your reputation's on the line here.
That's not what matters to me right now.
It should.
You played me.
I know how this looks.
Oh, do you?
Oh, well, please, enlighten me.
How does this look?
I didn't do it.
Yes, you did!
And now that's on me.
I bought in to your holier-than-thou garbage!
I put a psychotic killer back out on the street, and in less than 51 hours, you went right back to your old ways.
- I didn't want to.
- Then why did you?
Because he would have killed me.
No.
No.
It's more than that.
It better be more than that.
Why did you go to his house?
Why would you risk your freedom to go after this man?
This is the rest of Tom Wittman's house.
Okay, guys.
Derek said that the Sandersons got into an argument on the night of the murders.
So I went ahead and did a background check.
There is no history of abuse, domestic calls, therapy.
From the outside in, they were like the perfect family.
Nobody's perfect.
Yeah, but married right out of college, medical school, two kids, house on a hill, dog.
Pretty damn close, yeah?
Okay, so one night they argue.
He takes the couch, leaving the wife and kids upstairs vulnerable.
He claims the offenders broke in through the basement.
There were security bars on the window, but they were old and broken.
That was such an obscure fact, though.
It was deemed only someone with an intimate knowledge of the house would suggest that as an entry point.
Yeah, but that means that three people walked past Sanderson while he was sleeping on the couch.
Why didn't he wake up?
And why would they walk right past him without subduing him?
It looks like their goal was upstairs.
She had a stuffed animal.
Who does that to a 5-year-old?
You know, the child was an afterthought.
The overkill was on Mrs. Sanderson.
That's an understatement.
He was sending a message.
Like what?
He's in control.
He has all the power.
And he hates her.
You must be exhausted.
Doing good time just so you can get out and kill again.
I'm not a murderer.
You are a murderer.
You just stabbed a man to death.
I didn't have a choice.
He saw me, he panicked, he would have killed me.
I'm telling you, I didn't have a choice.
He didn't kill my family.
He was going to lead me to the one who did.
All right.
And if you had gotten to this person that allegedly killed your family, what were you gonna do then, the same thing you just did to Tom Wittman?
No, I'm not a killer.
Okay, yes.
Yes.
There wasn't a day that I was locked up where I didn't hope that whoever took my family's lives was dead.
I wanted to find him and I wanted to destroy his life like he did mine.
I wanted him... wanted him to pay!
Why wasn't Tom Wittman's name mentioned at your trial?
I didn't even know it until years later.
Agent, what I saw and what happened, that couldn't have been random.
So what did you do?
Just look at every single person that knew your family?
- Yeah.
- How?
How did you do that?
You never once asked for access to your case.
All of it was my memory.
I walked through that night a million times.
Tommy was just a kid then, 18, 19.
He worked at the corner market and brought our groceries home.
He and his friend, they would look for any reason to be near my wife.
I didn't like that.
Carrie told him so, and he stopped coming by.
So Tom felt abandoned by your wife and angry at you, so he acted out.
Yeah, you see, except... that night, he said...
he said, "That's enough."
See, it's like he had actual boundaries.
That's how you narrowed this down, to somebody who cared about your wife?
Yeah.
Tom...
Tom, he was just...
he was just...
He was a figure in the dark.
And then I heard his voice.
Good morning, Mr. Sanderson.
And that was familiar.
It took me a long time to place it.
Anyway, a few years later, I called the market and tried to find his full name.
Thomas Gregory Wittman.
I had Internet privileges once a week, and I found his address.
And then what?
A few days later, that heroin was planted in my cell.
I lost my privileges.
So Tom Wittman was the only link that you had to figuring out who was in your house that night?
And now I'm back to nothing.
Not necessarily.
You want to take him back to his house?
If he can't figure out who else was there that night, there's no way to prove his story.
All right.
Let's clean him up first.
This used to be a great place to live.
You ready?
Yeah.
No one stays here long, do they?
You were asleep on the couch?
In front of the fire.
So it was cold.
Yeah.
And pouring down rain.
The TV was on.
What were you watching?
Reruns.
I'd been on rotation for 36 hours.
Between that and the rain, it took me about just a minute to fall asleep.
What wakes you?
Daddy!
Daddy, help me, Daddy!
Help!
Please!
Don, help, please!
Don!
Daddy!
Daddy, help me!
Uhh!
Uhh!
No!
Shut up!
He's hurting them.
Who is?
Tom?
No, the one in the hood.
- Tom's saying...
- That's enough!
My little girl...
She shouldn't be seeing this.
Turn away, baby.
Turn away.
I can't get to her.
- Help me!
- Shut up!
No!
No, no, no, no!
You stay away from her!
There's a woman.
There she is.
What does she look like?
It's blurry.
Here you go.
She gave Abby her hippo.
My son.
She had my son.
What is she saying?
- Daddy.
- Stop it!
That's enough!
But he won't.
He keeps holding me down.
He's laughing.
- I want to keep him.
- He's just a baby.
Put it back.
No.
No!
- They're fighting.
- Put it back.
She wants to take my son.
I said put it back!
They could have taken my son.
But she didn't take your son.
He's safe.
They must have trusted one another.
We need to figure out who Tom Wittman's friends were back then.
The woman is the key.
She wanted to take the baby.
Yeah.
To build their own twisted family.
- All right, keep me posted.
- Okay.
Okay, the crazy thing about this is that nobody turned on one another.
So they have to have a bond.
Maybe they're related.
Tom Wittman didn't have any siblings.
It could be childhood friends.
Uh, the only marks on his record are from juvie.
He cleaned up after that.
What were his arrests?
Petty stuff.
Uh, anything related to breaking and entering?
Credit card schemes, retail robbery.
Okay, now wait.
That was big in the '80s.
One person would work in the store, and the other would use stolen credit cards.
Sounds like a team.
Yeah.
Was he arrested with anybody?
I found Tom Wittman's juvie records.
Other than him, no one was underage involved in any of his arrests.
Maybe they weren't the same age.
The woman wanted to keep a kid.
That doesn't sound like a teenager.
Okay, I'm gonna cross-ref the date of Wittman's arrest with others made on that same day.
Retail crimes.
Shoplifting was very big.
What about a woman who was arrested from the same department store as Tom?
Mary Rutka, 22 at the time.
- Is she from D. C?
- Born and raised.
Did she have any children?
One 19-year-old son.
Morgan, are you back yet?
We may have found the woman.
That's her.
Go.
He's going down the fire escape!
I need an ambulance and backup at 751 Hindry Street,
Northeast, Apartment 402.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Hold on.
Hey!
FBI!
It looks like she fought him.
So some guy breaks in here, kills her, then runs away.
- It's pretty risky.
- He's hiding something, and she was a witness to it.
He's cleaning up loose ends.
Well, it looks like he made a mess to me.
How'd you track her down?
She was arrested with Tom Wittman a long time ago.
Sanderson gets out,
Wittman's killed, and now Mary Rutka.
The whole thing's a house of cards.
He got away with it for 20 years.
He's not about to get caught now.
Any leads?
- Nothing more than we saw.
- Well, he knows you're on to him.
What do you think he's gonna do now?
Well, I don't think he'd trash the place for the hell of it.
I think he was looking for something and we interrupted him.
It makes sense why she survived until now.
What are you guys talking about?
Three people got away with murder.
How do you make sure no one rats the other out?
Blackmail.
It sounds like we need to profile a dormant killer.
A very lucky one.
He was essentially given a gift... a patsy in the form of Don Sanderson, and he'll do anything to protect that story.
When someone has a secret this big, everything becomes a lie.
He'll most likely be pathological.
So we're looking for a liar in D.C.
I thought we were trying to narrow this down.
Her son's 19 years old.
He doesn't have a bedroom, but she kept all his books.
She's sentimental.
Hey, Morgan.
Almost there.
Ah, sorry.
Daddy help you make them?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Did Josh help you make them?
Yeah, he got the blueberries.
He got the blue...
well, thank you very much.
I love you.
Iloveyou,too .
Welcome to the Sanderson home.
Don'tforgettheview.
They look down on everybody.
He sounds jealous.
- Let's do this.
- Shh.
You'll wake them.
Garcia, can you isolate these images?
Yeah.
Which one?
The one in the hood.
Do you think it's him?
That could be a thousand guys.
I want to see them.
No.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I wasn't allowed to have pictures for 25 years.
They thought that looking at them would get me off.
I don't want to forget my family.
See, they're... they're here, and they're in flashes, but I can feel them slipping away.
Please.
Daddy help you make them?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Did Josh help you make them?
- Yeah, he got the blueberries.
He got the blue...
Well, thank you very much.
And the butter.
And the butter.
Were you in charge of the eggs?
- Yeah.
- I know you like to break the eggs, right?
- Yeah.
- I love you.
Iloveyou,too .
Mommy...
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Pancakes.
You guys are too good to me.
What we just watched was...
Debilitating.
Frenzied.
And documented, but not for a trophy.
It seems to be from Wittman's point of view.
I mean, she's obviously an accessory.
Why not just destroy the evidence?
Because she got something out of it.
Her place was way more than she could afford, she never got married, and she had a son who went to private school.
Do you think it's his kid?
That would explain the bond and why he didn't get rid of her before today.
You said her place was nice.
If he's covering his tracks, he's paying her in cash.
Who can afford to do that?
You want me to find rich and powerful men in D. C?
Explain to me how to narrow down this list.
Start with me who grew up in the District, came from nothing.
His ambition will define him.
Whoever did this enjoys taking power away.
He's been way too smart to keep on killing.
So what would satisfy a guy like this?
Well, he's manipulative but trustworthy.
Two other people witnessed that murder, and they never turned on him.
Guys, so we have to think of this city as the unsub's comfort zone.
He didn't leave for a reason.
Target-rich environment.
The damage he's done and continues to do is right here in D.C.
Politics?
I think it's more intimate than that.
He needs victims who suffer directly from what he's doing.
Okay, I'll cross the politicians off my list.
Look into asset-based lenders, uh, big money-making ventures where people would be left in his wake.
Corporate takeovers.
Businessman as psychopath?
They're the same characteristics.
They just use their skills differently.
They both have narcissistic traits, such as a grandiose sense of self-importance, deceptiveness, lack of remorse.
Hard-core businessmen, 36 and counting.
That's way too many.
We can each take 6 and look for connections.
No, no.
Wait a minute.
If we had this case 25 years ago, what would we have seen?
How would we fight the physical evidence?
We need look at what the unsub did the moment he arrived at the house.
They broke into the basement.
Through a window with rusted-out bars.
Garcia, who lived at the house before the Sandersons?
Property records...
Well, it hasn't exchanged too many hands.
The Barretts, the Kramers, the Stanworths.
Any of those names on your list of businessmen?
Uh, no.
Let me look at that longer list.
Hold, please.
Hey, family of James Stanworth.
They lost the house in '82 and then they moved to the outskirts.
He sounded jealous on the tape.
That makes sense.
He knew the Sandersons, and he would obviously know that house.
There was nothing random about that attack.
He's a native Washingtonian, married with three kids.
Everything to lose.
- Oh.
- What?
He's running for Congress.
And check out his campaign slogan.
"Let's do this." He said that on the tape.
This won't be easy.
You want to arrest James Stanworth?
Are you out of your mind?
He's got motive.
Mary Rutka had a tape.
She was blackmailing him.
It was a hooded figure.
You can't prove it was him on that videotape.
He fits the profile, Erin.
Forgive me, but your profile sounds like a self-made man, not the psychopath you claim he is.
We said he'd be destructive.
In 1998 alone, he fired 6,000 people from one of his companies.
Some of those employees took their own lives.
This is the type of power and devastation that he enjoys.
Hearsay.
Slander if you're not careful.
Ma'am, he got into politics to be hard on crime.
He would have access to keep tabs on Don Sanderson.
And now you're sounding as paranoid as Don Sanderson.
You cannot accuse a man without a shred of physical evidence.
Mary Rutka had skin under her nails.
Maybe she left a mark.
And you cannot arrest a man based on the possibility of a scratch.
We can't arrest this man.
That's what you mean.
Don't pull any punches now, Erin.
You don't understand what the politics are, do you, Dave?
You never have.
No, I do.
I just don't care.
Ma'am, all due respect, but we have an innocent man in our custody, and the killer is still out there.
It just might be James Stanworth.
You don't have enough proof.
The BAU functions without you.
Don't push it.
So there's nothing we can do?
This guy's gonna get away with it.
No.
No, not a chance in hell.
Garcia, find me James Stanworth right now.
Yeah.
Another hour passes, he's that much closer to hiding his true self.
Mary Rutka's his third victim.
He's now officially a serial killer.
- What do you want to do?
- I want to expose this son of a bitch.
If he did kill Mary Rutka, he's gonna have cuts on him somewhere.
We match that DNA, we got him.
Guys, he's having a fund-raiser
- at his house in McLean.
- When?
It started an hour ago.
- Text me the address.
- Yep.
What if we're wrong?
Prentiss.
Which is why I insisted they come to D.C., meet the policymakers, see that it's not as simple as signing our names, that the problems we're dealing with are not easy ones, that we have to plan not two steps ahead,
but 200 steps, that it's not just about what's in our families' best interests, it's what's in our nation's.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Congressman, Mr. James Stanworth.
You sure have a way with words.
It's mighty impressive.
Thank you.
- May I help you?
- My name's Derek Morgan.
We're with the FBI.
Do your friends here know that you're a closet psychopath?
Excuse me?
Don Sanderson does.
Do you remember him?
I'm sure you do.
You murdered his entire family and got him put away for 25 years.
Well, Agent, if you've got anything on me...
No.
James, it's not on you, it's inside of you.
Killing Mary Rutka really got you going, didn't it?
I'm afraid I don't know who that is.
- Jim, what's going on?
- They were just leaving.
- But I don't understand...
- Don't worry.
He's good at that, isn't he?
Anger.
He's dismissive by nature.
Can't show affection, though, can he?
You walk on eggshells, you and the children.
- Jim...
- Shut up!
Oh, here he comes.
Where was your husband today around 3:00?
These are ridiculous fabrications.
It doesn't matter.
We know where he was.
I held the hand of the woman he murdered.
Right.
James, whoever did kill Mary left some DNA behind under her fingernails.
- What's that?
- Well, that would be a cut.
I cut myself on a broken glass.
No.
Mary Rutka did that to you trying to defend herself.
You knew that Don Sanderson was out after 25 years.
He got to Tom Wittman, and you were afraid that if he got to Mary, he might find you and bring you down for what you did to his family all those years ago.
- You're delusional, Agent.
- You panicked, and you killed Mary.
- I don't panic.
- You did panic.
You're a killer.
It's what you do.
You destroy people's lives.
I destroyed no one.
You put a man away for life, you murdered his family, and today you killed a woman who would never betray you...
- I killed no one.
...because you panicked.
You are a killer.
You are a psychopath.
You panicked, and...
I don't panic!
I don't panic!
There he is.
Jim, what's going on?
Shh!
Call Charles.
Don't say another word.
They've got nothing.
We found the tape.
James Stanworth, you're under arrest for the murder of Mary Rutka.
This is absurd.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney...
There hasn't been a second where I haven't thought about this.
Now it's here.
How does it feel?
I'm terrified.
You know, your son has been studying medicine.
He wants to open his own clinic.
It seems to me he's becoming a lot like his father.
I don't even know what he looks like.
Well, it looks like you're about to find out.
Yes, but I...
What am I supposed to say to him?
He knows that you didn't do it.
That's all you ever wanted him to know.
Yeah.
Go.
Show him who his dad really is.
Oh, my God.
Joshua.
All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered.
The point is to discover them.
Galileo.
FBI BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS UNIT QUANTICO, VIRGINIA
I understand, Hotch.
Take all the time you need.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll be fine.
Okay.
You too.
Hi.
I was hoping I could get a minute.
Agent Seaver has requested her remedial training be here.
She was only clear for one case.
That didn't end the way she had hoped.
I'd say.
She made a mistake.
But she remained calm under pressure.
She just wants to prove herself.
Hotch isn't here to supervise her.
I'll do it.
I'll be her training agent.
He signed off?
Via email.
But I know you have a history with her.
Don't make me regret this.
Thank you.
Ma'am.
Agent.
Have you heard from Aaron?
He sounds like he hadn't slept.
Do you think he's all right?
Jack's having some problems.
Well, it's been a year since...
Well, I'm glad he's finally taking some time off.
This is the only thing that's pending.
Donald Sanderson?
That was 20 years ago.
25, actually.
He's up for parole.
They've asked us to do a risk assessment.
Well, I can't do it, not with Aaron gone.
Well, who can?
Morgan, can you come in here?
Well, he's he's got to meet him today.
The parole board hearing is tomorrow.
Now, what was his story?
Junkies randomly attacked his family?
Yes, that's what he claimed.
He and his son survived.
Frankly, I don't understand how parole is even a consideration.
Well, he's eligible.
They're overcrowded.
Yes, but the physical evidence was shocking.
Who could possibly believe he would be innocent?
That's not our job.
All we need to see is how 25 years has changed his life.
Ma'am.
Is everything all right?
I need you to take a trip.
Who's this?
Don Sanderson.
He's been in Petersburg half his life and he's up for parole.
It appears he's become a model prisoner.
You don't sound convinced.
I don't know how someone who kills his wife and daughter can be rehabilitated.
Open 7.
On the gate.
Ssa Derek Morgan.
BAU.
You analyze behavior.
Close it.
Nobody's ever believed that I'm innocent.
Why would you?
May I?
Yeah.
I don't rely solely on physical evidence.
It says here that you were 2 years into your residency when all this happened.
What did you want to specialize in?
Pediatrics.
You haven't requested parole in over 18 years.
The system put me in here.
They're gonna keep me in here.
Time's gone by a little faster since I accepted that.
Has the heroin helped you pass the time?
They found it in your cell 2 years ago.
New regime had to assert power.
You're saying someone planted it.
It is what it is.
You hadn't been in solitary since you got here.
Gave me a lot of time to think about my son.
Your son's name is Joshua?
I'm sorry, I still don't understand how you're...
Can ignore all that evidence.
The prosecution said that I had an acute psychological break, that I was a psychopath.
Is that what you see?
Psychopaths are masters at hiding what's inside of them.
Is that what you think I've done?
Agent, do you have any idea what it's like to be accused of something that you didn't do?
You went to the infirmary 16 times, and not once did you ever try to fight back.
No.
The last time they beat me, they...
Well...
I...
I almost had it.
I mean, I didn't think that I was gonna make it.
And I was ok with that.
But I was lying there...
And I had this, uh...
Vision.
See, Joshua was, uh, was grown up.
The sun was shining on us.
I...
I don't know where we were.
But I got to tell him that I didn't hurt our family.
And that's what's kept you going?
And then I just didn't want to feel sorry for myself.
I wanted...
I wanted to...
to live my life in here the way that I would have lived it out there and do things that I got cheated out of with Joshua.
Is that why you've taught men how to read?
Why you started a mentor program?
You've helped... 41 inmates get their G.E.D.
Mr. Sanderson, this is the type of evidence I consider.
If you were to gain your freedom...
What would you do with it?
I can't even think about something like that.
But what would you do?
I would try and find my son...
And I'd tell him the truth.
Based on physical evidence,
Don Sanderson has been prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
But...
The way in which he has spent the last 25 years...
It throws doubt on that conviction.
Now, I know that is not the question at hand here today.
I have learned that behavior does not lie.
You all want to know whether or not this man has been reformed.
I believe that he has.
He's lost everything, yet somehow he has still managed to better himself.
More importantly to people around him, he's held on to the only good thing left in his life.
His son.
It's what defines him.
At this point, he's simply looking ahead.
Therefore, it is my belief that Don Sanderson is not a danger to himself or to society.
Goodbye, now.
I, uh, noticed you all drink double shots.
Oh, thanks.
You do, too?
This is the first.
I wanted to thank you for having my back.
I hope you have mine.
Front page news, eh?
Morgan must not think he did it.
Or believes he won't do it again.
Is agent Morgan in?
What do you need, Erin?
Metro P.D. sent this an hour ago.
And they want us to take a look?
No, they want you to take a look.
Who's this?
The man Don Sanderson just murdered.
"There is no such thing as part freedom."
Nelson Mandela.
Why didn't Sanderson just run?
Maybe he wanted to go back to prison.
There are plenty of ways to violate your parole other than homicide.
Is Morgan ok?
He just vouched for a man that turned around and killed someone.
So he's the one let him out?
Come on, bill, you know it's never that simple.
Oh, you see this all the time, Rossi.
Guy's out for a couple of days, he's gotta get back inside.
They why did he claim self-defense?
Why call the paramedics?
Why attempt CPR to keep him breathing?
Why not just flee the scene?
He wanted something else.
Like what?
I don't know yet.
Well, he's predictable, if you ask me.
He broke into this guy's basement and stabbed him, same way he did his wife.
Rossi.
He's coming with us.
Get out of the car.
Let's go, move.
You're welcome to join us.
After I clean up here.
This is not a random act of violence.
There has to be a reason.
Anything could have been a weapon.
So he chose to stab him, just like he did before.
Hello, Tommy.
So he dialed 911, then he performed CPR.
Why go through this big fight and then try and save him.
So the gun wasn't loaded, but he broke in, took it, and waited for Wittman to get home?
Why?
I don't know, love, but I do know that your victim legally purchased that .38 in '94, licensed to him.
Other than that, no weapons, wives, or children.
The guy was pretty much a loner.
So there's gotta be some sort of connection.
There isn't any yet.
I'm sorry.
All right.
Thank you, Garcia.
Yeah, hey, how is my boy?
Uh, fine.
Really?
No.
The bullets were in the other room, but the gun is right here.
Maybe killing him was an accident?
Does any of this strike you as hard to believe?
Neighbors confirmed hearing sounds of a confrontation.
Yeah, but Sanderson was out of prison for what, Reid?
At the time of the murder, 51 hours.
He's free for 2 days and change?
What's the big hurry to find this guy?
You woke up a free man and decided to kill Tom Wittman.
You gotta help us out here.
It doesn't look good for you.
It wasn't supposed to be like that.
He came at me.
I get it that you don't trust anyone right now.
But this man is the reason that you're free.
Did you find your son?
No.
Did you even look?
Drive.
How is he?
Clearing his head.
Strauss is waiting for you guys to come back.
Great.
That's all he needs.
We still don't know how Tom Wittman is connected to Don Sanderson.
All we know about him is everything Morgan went over, what he was accused of.
And that he killed Tom Whitman this morning.
The guy's not talking.
He doesn't trust anybody.
If he doesn't tell us who Tom Wittman is, how are we going to help Derek?
The answer's in there somewhere.
We just have to find it.
All right, March 10, 1985, 2:23 A.M.
Don Sanderson was asleep on his couch because of an argument he had with his wife.
He woke up to her screams.
He ran to the bedroom to find one man stabbing her, another man struck him from behind, knocking him unconscious.
His wounds were superficial in comparison, so it was easy for the prosecution to claim that Sanderson's wounds were self-inflicted.
And he had just finished his second year of residency at Georgetown, indicating he had the skills to do it to himself.
And his fingerprints were all over the weapon.
So, Sanderson comes to, his wife and daughter are dead.
Almost dead.
He called for help.
Sounds familiar.
He said that two men killed his wife, but when officers arrived, he changed his story.
He added a woman.
Let me guess.
They never found her.
No one ever looked.
So we have 3 people who commit a brutal double homicide, then never act on it again?
I don't know, it seems unlikely.
But nothing like that every happened after Sanderson went to prison.
The question is, how does Tom Wittman play into this?
He was a teenager at the time.
Strauss.
I want everything from Tom Wittman's apartment.
It's on its way.
Do you think Wittman was there that night?
That depends.
On what?
If you believe Sanderson's story.
My office will handle the press from here on.
That's unnecessary.
You don't need any more distractions.
He looks genuinely distraught.
He's very convincing.
I can see why you fell for it.
I don't need to remind you that your reputation's on the line here.
That's not what matters to me right now.
It should.
You played me.
I know how this looks.
Oh, do you?
Oh, well, please, enlighten me.
How does this look?
I didn't do it.
Yes, you did!
And now that's on me.
I bought into your holier-than-thou garbage!
I put a psychotic killer back out on the street, and in less than 51 hours you went right back to your old ways.
I didn't want to.
They why did you?
Because he would have killed me.
No.
No.
It's more than that.
It better be more than that.
Why did you go to his house?
Why would you risk your freedom to go after this man?
This is the rest of Tom Wittman's house.
Hey, guys.
Derek said that the Sandersons got into an argument on the night of the murders.
So, I went ahead and did a background check.
There is no history of abuse, domestic calls, therapy.
From the outside in they were like the perfect family.
Nobody's perfect.
Yeah, but married right out of college, medical school, 2 kids, house on a hill, dog.
Pretty damn close.
Yeah?
Ok, so one night they argue.
He takes the couch, leaving the wife and kids upstairs vulnerable.
He claims the offenders broke in through the basement.
There were security bars on the window, but they were old and broken.
That was such an obscure fact, though.
It was deemed only someone with an intimate knowledge of the house would suggest that as an entry point.
Yeah, but that means that 3 people walked past Sanderson while he was sleeping on the couch.
Why didn't he wake up?
And why would they walk right past him without subduing him?
It looks like their goal was upstairs.
She had a stuffed animal.
Who does that to a 5-year-old?
You know, the child was an afterthought.
The overkill was on Mrs. Sanderson.
That's an understatement.
He was sending a message.
Like what?
He's in control.
He has all the power.
And he hates her.
You must be exhausted.
Doing good time just so you can get out and kill again.
I'm not a murderer.
You are a murderer.
You just stabbed a man to death.
I didn't have a choice.
He saw me, he panicked, he would have killed me.
I'm telling you, I didn't have a choice.
He didn't kill my family.
He was going to lead me to the one who did.
All right.
And if you had gotten to this person that allegedly killed your family, what were you gonna do then, the same thing you just did to Tom Wittman?
No, I'm not a killer.
Ok, yes.
Yes.
There wasn't a day that I was locked up where I didn't hope that whoever took my family's lives was dead.
I wanted to find him and I wanted to destroy his life like he did mine.
I wanted him to pay!
Why wasn't tom Wittman's name mentioned at your trial?
I didn't even know it until years later.
Agent, what I saw and what happened, that couldn't have been random.
So what did you do?
Just look at every single person that knew your family?
Yeah.
How did you do that?
You never once asked for access to your case.
All of it was my memory.
I walked through that night a million times.
Tommy was just a kid then, 18, 19.
He worked at the corner market and brought our groceries home.
He and his friend, they would look for any reason to be near my wife.
I didn't like that.
Carrie told him so and he stopped coming by.
So tom felt abandoned by your wife and angry at you, so he acted out.
Yeah, you see, except...
That night he said...
he said, "that's enough."
See, it's like he had actual boundaries.
That's how you narrowed this down, to somebody who cared about your wife?
Yeah.
Tom... tom, he was just...
he was just... he was a figure in the dark.
And then I heard his voice.
Good morning, Mr. Sanderson.
And that was familiar.
It took me a long time to place it.
Anyway, a few years later, I called the market and tried to find his full name.
Thomas Gregory Wittman.
I had Internet privileges once a week, and I found his address.
And then what?
A few days later, that heroin was planted in my cell.
I lost my privileges.
So tom Wittman was the only link that you had to figuring out who was in your house that night?
And now I'm back to nothing.
Not necessarily.
You want to take him back to his house?
If he can't figure out who else was there that night, there's no way to prove his story.
All right.
Let's clean him up first.
This used to be a great place to live.
You ready?
Yeah.
No one stays here long, do they?
You were asleep on the couch?
In front of the fire.
So it was cold.
Yeah.
And pouring down rain.
The tv was on.
What were you watching?
Reruns.
I'd been on rotation for 36 hours.
Between that and the rain, it took me about just a minute to fall asleep.
What wakes you?
Daddy!
Daddy, help me, daddy!
Help!
Please!
Help!
Don!
Daddy!
Daddy, help me!
Uhh!
Uhh!
No!
Shut up!
He's hurting them.
Who is?
Tom?
No, the one in the hood.
Tom's saying...
That's enough!
My little girl...
She shouldn't be seeing this.
Turn away, baby.
Turn away.
I can't get to her.
Shut up!
Help me!
No!
No, no, no, no!
You stay away from her!
There's a woman.
There she is.
What does she look like?
It's blurry.
Here you go.
She gave Abby her hippo.
My son.
She had my son.
What is she saying?
Stop it!
That's enough!
But he won't.
He keeps holding me down.
He's laughing.
I want to keep him.
He's just a baby.
Put it back.
No.
No!
They're fighting.
Put it back.
She wants to take my son.
I said put it back!
They could have taken my son.
But she didn't take your son.
He's safe.
They must have trusted one another.
We need to figure out who tom Wittman's friends were back then.
The woman is the key.
She wanted to take the baby.
Yeah.
To build their own twisted family.
All right, keep me posted.
Ok.
Ok, the crazy thing about this is that nobody turned on one another.
So they have to have a bond.
Maybe they're related.
Tom Wittman didn't have any siblings.
It could be childhood friends.
Uh, the only marks on his record are from juvie.
He cleaned up after that.
What were his arrests?
Petty stuff.
Uh, anything related to breaking and entering?
Credit card schemes, retail robbery.
Ok, now, wait.
That was big in the eighties.
One person would work in the store and the other would use stolen credit cards.
Sounds like a team.
Yeah.
Was he arrested with anybody?
I found tom Wittman's juvie records.
Other than him, no one was underage involved in any of his arrests.
Maybe they weren't the same age.
The woman wanted to keep a kid.
That doesn't sound like a teenager.
Ok, I'm gonna cross-ref the date of Wittman's arrest with others made on that same day.
Retail crimes.
Shoplifting was very big.
What about a woman who was arrested from the same department store as tom?
Mary Rutka, 22 at the time.
Is she from D.C.?
Born and raised.
Did she have any children?
One 19-year-old son.
Morgan, are you back yet?
We may have found the woman.
That's her.
Go.
He's going down the fire escape!
I need an ambulance and backup at 751 Hindry street, northeast, apartment 402.
It's ok.
It's ok.
Hold on.
Hey!
FBI!
It looks like she fought him.
So some guy breaks in here, kills her, then runs away.
It's pretty risky.
He's hiding something and she was a witness to it.
He's cleaning up loose ends.
Well, it looks like he made a mess to me.
How'd you track her down.
She was arrested with tom Wittman a long time ago.
Sanderson gets out,
Wittman's killed, and now Mary Rutka.
The whole thing's a house of cards.
He got away with it for 20 years.
He's not about to get caught now.
Any leads?
Nothing more than we saw.
Well, he knows you're onto him.
What do you think he's gonna do now?
Well, I don't think he'd trash the place for the hell of it.
I think he was looking for something and we interrupted him.
It makes sense why she survived until now.
What are you guys talking about?
3 people got away with murder.
How do you make sure no one rats the other out?
Blackmail.
It sounds like we need to profile a dormant killer.
A very lucky one.
He was essentially given a gift... a patsy in the form of Don Sanderson, and he'll do anything to protect that story.
When someone has a secret this big, everything becomes a lie.
He'll most likely be pathological.
So, we're looking for a liar in D.C.
I thought we were trying to narrow this down.
Her son's 19 years old.
He doesn't have a bedroom, but she kept all his books.
She's sentimental.
Hey, Morgan.
Almost there.
Ah, sorry.
Daddy help you make them?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Did Josh help you make them?
Yeah, he got the blueberries.
He got the blue...
well, thank you very much.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Welcome to the Sanderson home.
Don't forget the view.
They look down on everybody.
He sounds jealous.
Shh.
You'll wake them.
Let's do this.
Garcia, can you isolate these images?
Yeah.
Which one?
The one in the hood.
You think it's him?
That could be a thousand guys.
I want to see them.
No.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I wasn't allowed to have pictures.
For 25 years.
They thought that looking at them would get me off.
I don't want to forget my family.
See, they're... they're here, and they're in flashes.
But I can feel them slipping away.
Please.
Daddy help you make them?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Did Josh help you make them?
Yeah, he got the blueberries.
He got the blue...
well, thank you very much.
And the butter.
And the butter.
Were you I charge of the eggs?
Yeah.
I know you like to break the eggs, right?
I love you.
I love you, too.
Mommy...
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Ohh!
Pancakes.
You guys are too good to me.
What we just watched was...
Debilitating.
Frenzied.
And documented, but not for a trophy.
It seems to be from Wittman's point of view.
I mean, she's obviously an accessory.
Why not just destroy the evidence?
Because she got something out of it.
Her place was way more than she could afford.
She never got married.
And she had a son who went to private school.
Do you think it's his kid?
That would explain the bond and why he didn't get rid of her before today.
You said her place was nice.
If he's covering his tracks, he's paying her in cash.
Who can afford to do that?
You want me to find rich and powerful men in D.C.?
Explain to me how to narrow down this list.
Start with me who grew up in the district, came from nothing.
His ambition will define him.
Whoever did this enjoys taking power away.
He's been way too smart to keep on killing.
So what would satisfy a guy like this?
Well, he's manipulative but trustworthy.
Two other people witnessed that murder and they never turned on him.
Guys, so we have to think of this city as the unsub's comfort zone.
He didn't leave for a reason.
A target-rich environment.
The damage he's done and continues to do is right here in D.C.
Politics?
I think it's more intimate than that.
He needs victims who suffer directly from what he's doing.
Ok, I'll cross the politicians off my list.
Look into asset-based lenders, uh, big money-making ventures where people would be left in his wake.
Corporate takeovers.
Businessman as psychopath?
They have the same characteristics.
They just use their skills differently.
They both have narcissistic traits, such as a grandiose sense of self-importance, deceptiveness, lack of remorse.
Hard-core businessmen, 36 and counting.
That's way too many.
We can each take 6 and look for connections.
No, no.
Wait a minute.
If we had this case 25 years ago, what would we have seen?
How would we fight the physical evidence?
We'd look at what the unsub did the moment he arrived at the house.
They broke into the basement.
Through a window with rusted-out bars.
Garcia, who lived at the house before the Sandersons?
Property records...
Well, it hasn't exchanged too many hands.
The Barretts, the Kramers, the Stanworths.
Any of those names on your list of businessmen?
Uh, no.
Let me look at that longer list.
Hold, please.
Hey, family of James Stanworth.
They lost the house in '82 and then they moved to the outskirts.
He sounded jealous on the tape.
That makes sense.
He knew the Sandersons and he would obviously know that house.
There was nothing random about that attack.
A native washingtonian, married with 3 kids.
Everything to lose.
What?
He's running for congress.
Check out his campaign slogan.
"Let's do this."
He said that on the tape.
This won't be easy.
You want to arrest James Stanworth?
Are you out of your mind?
He's got motive.
Mary Rutka had a tape.
She was blackmailing him.
It was a hooded figure.
You can't prove it was him on that videotape.
He fits the profile, Erin.
Forgive me, but your profile sounds like a self-made man, not the psychopath you claim he is.
We said he'd be destructive.
In 1998 alone, he fired 6,000 people from one of his companies.
Some of those employees took their own lives.
This is the type of power and devastation that he enjoys.
Hearsay.
Slander if you're not careful.
Ma'am, he got into politics to be hard on crime.
He would have access to keep tabs on Don Sanderson.
And now you're sounding as paranoid as Don Sanderson.
You cannot accuse a man without a shred of physical evidence.
Mary Rutka had skin under her nails.
Maybe she left a mark.
And you cannot arrest a man based on the possibility of a scratch.
We can't arrest this man.
That's what you mean.
Don't pull any punches now, Erin.
You don't understand what the politics are, do you, Dave?
You never have.
No, I do.
I just don't care.
Ma'am, with all due respect, we have an innocent man in our custody, and the killer is still out there.
It just might be James Stanworth.
You don't have enough proof.
The BAU functions without you.
Don't push it.
So there's nothing we can do?
This guy's gonna get away with it?
No.
No, not a chance in hell.
Yeah.
Garcia, find me James Stanworth right now.
Another hour passes, he's that much closer to hiding his true self.
Mary Rutka's his third victim.
He's now officially a serial killer.
What do you want to do?
I want to expose this son of a bitch.
If he did kill Mary Rutka, he's gonna have cuts on him somewhere.
We match that DNA, we got him.
Guys, he's having a fund-raiser at his house in Mclean.
When?
It started an hour ago.
Yep.
Text me the address.
What if we're wrong?
Prentiss.
Which is why I insisted they come to D.C., meet the policymakers, see that it's not as simple as signing our names, that the problems we're dealing with are not easy ones, that we have to plan not 2 steps ahead,
but 200 steps.
That it's not just about what's in our families' best interests, it's what's in our nation's.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, congressman, Mr. James Stanworth.
You sure have a way with words.
It's mighty impressive.
Thank you.
May I help you?
My name's Derek Morgan.
I'm with the FBI.
Do your friends here know that you're a closet psychopath?
Excuse me?
Don Sanderson knows.
Do you remember him?
I'm sure you do.
You murdered his entire family and got him put away for 25 years.
Well, agent, if you've got anything on me...
No.
James, it's not on you, it's inside of you.
Killing Mary Rutka really got you going, didn't it?
I'm afraid I don't know who that is.
- Jim, what's going on?
- They were just leaving.
But I don't understand... don't worry.
He's good at that, isn't he?
Anger.
He's dismissive by nature.
Can't show affection, though, can he?
You walk on eggshells, you and the children.
Shut up!
Jim...
Here it comes.
Where was your husband today around 3:00?
These are ridiculous fabrications.
It doesn't matter.
We know where he was.
I held the hand of the woman he murdered.
Right.
James, whoever did kill Mary left some DNA behind, under her fingernails.
What's that?
Well, that would be a cut.
I cut myself on a broken glass.
No.
Mary Rutka did that to you trying to defend herself.
You knew that Don Sanderson was out after 25 years.
He got to tom Wittman, and you were afraid that if he got to Mary, he might find you and bring you down for what you did to his family all those years ago.
You're delusional, agent.
You panicked and you killed Mary.
You did panic.
I don't panic.
You're a killer.
It's what you do.
You destroy people's lives.
I destroyed no one.
You put a man away for life, you murdered his family, and today you killed a woman
I killed no one.
Who would never betray you, because you panicked.
You are a killer.
You are a psychopath.
You panicked and...
I don't panic!
I don't panic!
There he is.
Jim, what's going on.
Call Charles.
Don't say another word.
They've got nothing.
We found the tape.
James Stanworth, you're under arrest for the murder of Mary Rutka.
This is absurd.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney...
There hasn't been a second when I haven't thought about this.
Now it's here.
How does it feel?
I'm terrified.
You know, your son has been studying medicine.
He wants to open his own clinic.
It seems to me he's becoming a lot like his father.
I don't even know what he looks like.
Well, it looks like you're about to find out.
Yes, but I...
What am I supposed to say to him?
He knows that you didn't do it.
That's all you ever wanted him to know.
Yeah.
Go.
Show him who is dad really is.
Oh, my God.
Joshua.
"All truths are easy to understand
"once they are discovered.
The point is to discover them."
Galileo.
I understand, Hotch.
Take all the time you need.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll be fine.
Okay.
You, too.
Hi.
I was hoping I could get a minute.
Agent Seaver has requested her remedial training be here.
She was only cleared for one case.
That didn't end the way she had hoped.
I'd say.
She made a mistake.
But she remained calm under pressure.
She just wants to prove herself.
Hotch isn't here to supervise her.
I'll do it.
I'll be her training agent.
He signed off?
Via email.
But I know you have a history with her.
Don't make me regret this.
Thank you.
Ma'am.
Agent.
Have you heard from Aaron?
He sounds like he hadn't slept.
Do you think he's all right?
Jack's having some problems.
Well, it's been a year since...
Well, I'm glad he's finally taking some time off.
This is the only thing that's pending.
Donald Sanderson?
That was 20 years ago.
25, actually.
He's up for parole.
They've asked us to do a risk assessment.
Well, I can't do it, not with Aaron gone.
Well, who can?
Morgan, can you come in here?
Well, he's he's got to meet him today.
The parole board hearing is tomorrow.
Now, what was his story?
Junkies randomly attacked his family?
Yes, that's what he claimed.
He and his son survived.
Frankly, I don't understand how parole is even a consideration.
Well, he's eligible.
They're overcrowded.
Yes, but the physical evidence was shocking.
Who could possibly believe he would be innocent?
That's not our job.
All we need to see is how 25 years has changed his life.
Ma'am.
Is everything all right?
I need you to take a trip.
Who's this?
Don Sanderson.
He's been in Petersburg half his life and he's up for parole.
It appears he's become a model prisoner.
You don't sound convinced.
I don't know how someone who kills his wife and daughter can be rehabilitated.
Open 7.
On the gate.
SSA Derek Morgan.
BAU.
You analyze behavior.
Close it.
Nobody's ever believed that I'm innocent.
Why would you?
- May I?
- Yeah.
I don't rely solely on physical evidence.
It says here that you were two years into your residency when all this happened.
What did you want to specialize in?
Pediatrics.
You haven't requested parole in over 18 years.
The system put me in here.
They're gonna keep me in here.
Time's gone by a little faster since I accepted that.
Has the heroin helped you pass the time?
They found it in your cell two years ago.
New regime had to assert power.
You're saying someone planted it.
Oh.
It is what it is.
You hadn't been in solitary since you got here.
Gave me a lot of time to think about my son.
Your son's name is Joshua?
I'm sorry.
I still don't understand how... how you're... gonna ignore all that evidence.
The prosecution said that I had an acute psychological break, that I was a psychopath.
Is that what you see?
Psychopaths are masters at hiding what's inside of them.
Is that what you think I've done?
Agent, do you have any idea what it's like to be accused of something that you didn't do?
You went to the infirmary 16 times, and not once did you ever try to fight back.
No.
The last time they beat me, they... well...
I...
I almost had it.
I mean, I didn't think that I was gonna make it.
And I was okay with that.
But I was lying there... and I had this, uh... vision.
See, Joshua was, uh... was grown up.
The sun was shining on us.
I...
I don't know where we were.
But I got to tell him that I didn't hurt our family.
And that's what's kept you going?
I thought just didn't want to feel sorry for myself.
I wanted...
I wanted to...
to live my life in here the way that I would have lived it out there and do things that I got cheated out of with Joshua.
Is that why you've taught men how to read?
Why you started a mentor program?
You've helped... 41 inmates get their GED.
Mr. Sanderson, this is the type of evidence I consider.
If you were to gain your freedom, what would you do with it?
I can't even think about something like that.
But what would you do?
I would try and find my son.
And I'd tell him the truth.
Based on physical evidence,
Don Sanderson has been prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
But the way in which he has spent the last 25 years... it throws doubt on that conviction.
Now, I know that is not the question at hand here today.
I have learned that behavior does not lie.
You all want to know whether or not this man has been reformed.
I believe that he has.
He's lost everything, yet somehow he has still managed to better himself.
More importantly, the people around him.
He's held on to the only good thing left in his life... his son.
It's what defines him.
At this point, he's simply looking ahead.
Therefore, it is my belief that Don Sanderson is not a danger to himself or to society.
Goodbye, now.
I, uh, noticed you all drink double shots.
Oh, thanks.
You do, too?
This is a first.
I wanted to thank you for having my back.
I hope you have mine.
Front page news, huh?
Morgan must not think he did it.
Or believes he won't do it again.
Is Agent Morgan in?
What do you need, Erin?
Metro P.D. Sent this an hour ago.
And they want us to take a look?
No, they want you to take a look.
Who's this?
The man Don Sanderson just murdered.
There is no such thing as part freedom.
Nelson Mandela.
Why didn't Sanderson just run?
Maybe he wanted to go back to prison.
There are plenty of ways to violate your parole other than homicide.
- Is Morgan okay?
- He just vouched for a man that turned around and killed someone.
So he's the one who let him out?
Come on, Bill, you know it's never that simple.
Oh, you see this all the time, Rossi.
Guy's out for a couple of days, he's gotta get back inside.
They why did he claim self-defense?
Why call the paramedics?
Why attempt CPR to keep him breathing?
Why not just flee the scene?
He wanted something else.
Like what?
I don't know yet.
Well, he's predictable, if you ask me.
He broke into this guy's basement and stabbed him, same way he did his wife.
Rossi, he's coming with us.
Get out of the car.
Let's go, move.
You're welcome to join us.
After I clean up here.
This is not a random act of violence.
There has to be a reason.
Anything could have been a weapon.
So he chose to stab him, just like he did before.
Hello, Tommy.
Aah!
So he dialed 911, then he performed CPR.
Why go through this big fight and then try and save him?
So the gun wasn't loaded, but he broke in, took it, and waited for Wittman to get home?
Why?
I don't know, love, but I do know that your victim legally purchased that.38 in '94, licensed to him.
Other than that, no weapons, wives, or children.
The guy was pretty much a loner.
So there's gotta be some sort of connection.
There isn't any yet.
I'm sorry.
All right.
Thank you, Garcia.
Yeah, hey, how is my boy?
Uh, fine.
Really?
No.
Oh.
The bullets were in the other room, but the gun is right here.
Maybe killing him was an accident?
Does any of this strike you as hard to believe?
Neighbors confirmed hearing sounds of a confrontation.
Yeah, but Sanderson was out of prison for what, Reid?
At the time of the murder, 51 hours.
He's free for two days and change?
What's the big hurry to find this guy?
You woke up a free man and decided to kill Tom Wittman.
You gotta help us out here.
It doesn't look good for you.
It wasn't supposed to be like that.
He came at me.
I get it that you don't trust anyone right now, but this man is the reason that you're free.
Did you find your son?
No.
Did you even look?
Drive.
How is he?
Clearing his head.
Strauss is waiting for you guys to come back.
Great.
That's all he needs.
We still don't know how Tom Wittman is connected to Don Sanderson.
All we know about him is everything Morgan went over, what he was accused of.
And that he killed Tom Whitman this morning.
The guy's not talking.
He doesn't trust anybody.
If he doesn't tell us who Tom Wittman is, how are we going to help Derek?
The answer's in there somewhere.
We just have to find it.
All right, March 10, 1985, 2:23 a.m.
Don Sanderson was asleep on his couch because of an argument he had with his wife.
He woke up to her screams.
He ran to the bedroom to find one man stabbing her.
Another man struck him from behind, knocking him unconscious.
His wounds were superficial in comparison, so it was easy for the prosecution to claim that Sanderson's wounds were self-inflicted.
And he had just finished his second year of residency at Georgetown, indicating he had the skills to do it to himself.
And his fingerprints were all over the weapon.
So Sanderson comes to.
His wife and daughter are dead.
Almost dead.
He called for help.
Sounds familiar.
He said that two men killed his wife, but when officers arrived, he changed his story.
He added a woman.
Let me guess.
They never found her.
No one ever looked.
So wait, three people commit a brutal double homicide, then never act on it again?
I don't know, it seems unlikely.
But nothing like that ever happened after Sanderson went to prison.
The question is, how does Tom Wittman play into this?
He was a teenager at the time.
Strauss.
I want everything from Tom Wittman's apartment.
It's on its way.
Do you think Wittman was there that night?
- That depends.
- On what?
If you believe Sanderson's story.
My office will handle the press from here on.
That's unnecessary.
You don't need any more distractions.
He looks genuinely distraught.
He's very convincing.
I can see why you fell for it.
I don't need to remind you that your reputation's on the line here.
That's not what matters to me right now.
It should.
You played me.
I know how this looks.
Oh, do you?
Oh, well, please, enlighten me.
How does this look?
I didn't do it.
Yes, you did!
And now that's on me.
I bought in to your holier-than-thou garbage!
I put a psychotic killer back out on the street, and in less than 51 hours, you went right back to your old ways.
- I didn't want to.
- Then why did you?
Because he would have killed me.
No.
No.
It's more than that.
It better be more than that.
Why did you go to his house?
Why would you risk your freedom to go after this man?
This is the rest of Tom Wittman's house.
Okay, guys.
Derek said that the Sandersons got into an argument on the night of the murders.
So I went ahead and did a background check.
There is no history of abuse, domestic calls, therapy.
From the outside in, they were like the perfect family.
Nobody's perfect.
Yeah, but married right out of college, medical school, two kids, house on a hill, dog.
Pretty damn close, yeah?
Okay, so one night they argue.
He takes the couch, leaving the wife and kids upstairs vulnerable.
He claims the offenders broke in through the basement.
There were security bars on the window, but they were old and broken.
That was such an obscure fact, though.
It was deemed only someone with an intimate knowledge of the house would suggest that as an entry point.
Yeah, but that means that three people walked past Sanderson while he was sleeping on the couch.
Why didn't he wake up?
And why would they walk right past him without subduing him?
It looks like their goal was upstairs.
She had a stuffed animal.
Who does that to a 5-year-old?
You know, the child was an afterthought.
The overkill was on Mrs. Sanderson.
That's an understatement.
He was sending a message.
Like what?
He's in control.
He has all the power.
And he hates her.
You must be exhausted.
Doing good time just so you can get out and kill again.
I'm not a murderer.
You are a murderer.
You just stabbed a man to death.
I didn't have a choice.
He saw me, he panicked, he would have killed me.
I'm telling you, I didn't have a choice.
He didn't kill my family.
He was going to lead me to the one who did.
All right.
And if you had gotten to this person that allegedly killed your family, what were you gonna do then, the same thing you just did to Tom Wittman?
No, I'm not a killer.
Okay, yes.
Yes.
There wasn't a day that I was locked up where I didn't hope that whoever took my family's lives was dead.
I wanted to find him and I wanted to destroy his life like he did mine.
I wanted him... wanted him to pay!
Why wasn't Tom Wittman's name mentioned at your trial?
I didn't even know it until years later.
Agent, what I saw and what happened, that couldn't have been random.
So what did you do?
Just look at every single person that knew your family?
- Yeah.
- How?
How did you do that?
You never once asked for access to your case.
All of it was my memory.
I walked through that night a million times.
Tommy was just a kid then, 18, 19.
He worked at the corner market and brought our groceries home.
He and his friend, they would look for any reason to be near my wife.
I didn't like that.
Carrie told him so, and he stopped coming by.
So Tom felt abandoned by your wife and angry at you, so he acted out.
Yeah, you see, except... that night, he said... he said, "That's enough."
See, it's like he had actual boundaries.
That's how you narrowed this down, to somebody who cared about your wife?
Yeah.
Tom...
Tom, he was just... he was just...
He was a figure in the dark.
And then I heard his voice.
Good morning, Mr. Sanderson.
And that was familiar.
It took me a long time to place it.
Anyway, a few years later, I called the market and tried to find his full name.
Thomas Gregory Wittman.
I had Internet privileges once a week, and I found his address.
And then what?
A few days later, that heroin was planted in my cell.
I lost my privileges.
So Tom Wittman was the only link that you had to figuring out who was in your house that night?
And now I'm back to nothing.
Not necessarily.
You want to take him back to his house?
If he can't figure out who else was there that night, there's no way to prove his story.
All right.
Let's clean him up first.
This used to be a great place to live.
You ready?
Yeah.
No one stays here long, do they?
You were asleep on the couch?
In front of the fire.
So it was cold.
Yeah.
And pouring down rain.
The TV was on.
What were you watching?
Reruns.
I'd been on rotation for 36 hours.
Between that and the rain, it took me about just a minute to fall asleep.
What wakes you?
Daddy!
Daddy, help me, Daddy!
Help!
Please!
Don, help, please!
Don!
Daddy!
Daddy, help me!
Uhh!
Uhh!
No!
Shut up!
He's hurting them.
Who is?
Tom?
No, the one in the hood.
- Tom's saying...
- That's enough!
My little girl...
She shouldn't be seeing this.
Turn away, baby.
Turn away.
I can't get to her.
- Help me!
- Shut up!
No!
No, no, no, no!
You stay away from her!
There's a woman.
There she is.
What does she look like?
It's blurry.
Here you go.
She gave Abby her hippo.
My son.
She had my son.
What is she saying?
- Daddy.
- Stop it!
That's enough!
But he won't.
He keeps holding me down.
He's laughing.
- I want to keep him.
- He's just a baby.
Put it back.
No.
No!
- They're fighting.
- Put it back.
She wants to take my son.
I said put it back!
They could have taken my son.
But she didn't take your son.
He's safe.
They must have trusted one another.
We need to figure out who Tom Wittman's friends were back then.
The woman is the key.
She wanted to take the baby.
Yeah.
To build their own twisted family.
- All right, keep me posted.
- Okay.
Okay, the crazy thing about this is that nobody turned on one another.
So they have to have a bond.
Maybe they're related.
Tom Wittman didn't have any siblings.
It could be childhood friends.
Uh, the only marks on his record are from juvie.
He cleaned up after that.
What were his arrests?
Petty stuff.
Uh, anything related to breaking and entering?
Credit card schemes, retail robbery.
Okay, now wait.
That was big in the '80s.
One person would work in the store, and the other would use stolen credit cards.
Sounds like a team.
Yeah.
Was he arrested with anybody?
I found Tom Wittman's juvie records.
Other than him, no one was underage involved in any of his arrests.
Maybe they weren't the same age.
The woman wanted to keep a kid.
That doesn't sound like a teenager.
Okay, I'm gonna cross-ref the date of Wittman's arrest with others made on that same day.
Retail crimes.
Shoplifting was very big.
What about a woman who was arrested from the same department store as Tom?
Mary Rutka, 22 at the time.
- Is she from D. C?
- Born and raised.
Did she have any children?
One 19-year-old son.
Morgan, are you back yet?
We may have found the woman.
That's her.
Go.
He's going down the fire escape!
I need an ambulance and backup at 751 Hindry Street,
Northeast, Apartment 402.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Hold on.
Hey!
FBI!
It looks like she fought him.
So some guy breaks in here, kills her, then runs away.
- It's pretty risky.
- He's hiding something, and she was a witness to it.
He's cleaning up loose ends.
Well, it looks like he made a mess to me.
How'd you track her down?
She was arrested with Tom Wittman a long time ago.
Sanderson gets out,
Wittman's killed, and now Mary Rutka.
The whole thing's a house of cards.
He got away with it for 20 years.
He's not about to get caught now.
Any leads?
- Nothing more than we saw.
- Well, he knows you're on to him.
What do you think he's gonna do now?
Well, I don't think he'd trash the place for the hell of it.
I think he was looking for something and we interrupted him.
It makes sense why she survived until now.
What are you guys talking about?
Three people got away with murder.
How do you make sure no one rats the other out?
Blackmail.
It sounds like we need to profile a dormant killer.
A very lucky one.
He was essentially given a gift... a patsy in the form of Don Sanderson, and he'll do anything to protect that story.
When someone has a secret this big, everything becomes a lie.
He'll most likely be pathological.
So we're looking for a liar in D.C.
I thought we were trying to narrow this down.
Her son's 19 years old.
He doesn't have a bedroom, but she kept all his books.
She's sentimental.
Hey, Morgan.
Almost there.
Ah, sorry.
Daddy help you make them?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Did Josh help you make them?
Yeah, he got the blueberries.
He got the blue... well, thank you very much.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Welcome to the Sanderson home.
Don't forget the view.
They look down on everybody.
He sounds jealous.
- Let's do this.
- Shh.
You'll wake them.
Garcia, can you isolate these images?
Yeah.
Which one?
The one in the hood.
Do you think it's him?
That could be a thousand guys.
I want to see them.
No.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I wasn't allowed to have pictures for 25 years.
They thought that looking at them would get me off.
I don't want to forget my family.
See, they're... they're here, and they're in flashes, but I can feel them slipping away.
Please.
Daddy help you make them?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Did Josh help you make them?
- Yeah, he got the blueberries.
He got the blue...
Well, thank you very much.
And the butter.
And the butter.
Were you in charge of the eggs?
- Yeah.
- I know you like to break the eggs, right?
- Yeah.
- I love you.
I love you, too.
Mommy...
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Pancakes.
You guys are too good to me.
What we just watched was...
Debilitating.
Frenzied.
And documented, but not for a trophy.
It seems to be from Wittman's point of view.
I mean, she's obviously an accessory.
Why not just destroy the evidence?
Because she got something out of it.
Her place was way more than she could afford, she never got married, and she had a son who went to private school.
Do you think it's his kid?
That would explain the bond and why he didn't get rid of her before today.
You said her place was nice.
If he's covering his tracks, he's paying her in cash.
Who can afford to do that?
You want me to find rich and powerful men in D. C?
Explain to me how to narrow down this list.
Start with me who grew up in the District, came from nothing.
His ambition will define him.
Whoever did this enjoys taking power away.
He's been way too smart to keep on killing.
So what would satisfy a guy like this?
Well, he's manipulative but trustworthy.
Two other people witnessed that murder, and they never turned on him.
Guys, so we have to think of this city as the unsub's comfort zone.
He didn't leave for a reason.
Target-rich environment.
The damage he's done and continues to do is right here in D.C.
Politics?
I think it's more intimate than that.
He needs victims who suffer directly from what he's doing.
Okay, I'll cross the politicians off my list.
Look into asset-based lenders, uh, big money-making ventures where people would be left in his wake.
Corporate takeovers.
Businessman as psychopath?
They're the same characteristics.
They just use their skills differently.
They both have narcissistic traits, such as a grandiose sense of self-importance, deceptiveness, lack of remorse.
Hard-core businessmen, 36 and counting.
That's way too many.
We can each take 6 and look for connections.
No, no.
Wait a minute.
If we had this case 25 years ago, what would we have seen?
How would we fight the physical evidence?
We need look at what the unsub did the moment he arrived at the house.
They broke into the basement.
Through a window with rusted-out bars.
Garcia, who lived at the house before the Sandersons?
Property records...
Well, it hasn't exchanged too many hands.
The Barretts, the Kramers, the Stanworths.
Any of those names on your list of businessmen?
Uh, no.
Let me look at that longer list.
Hold, please.
Hey, family of James Stanworth.
They lost the house in '82 and then they moved to the outskirts.
He sounded jealous on the tape.
That makes sense.
He knew the Sandersons, and he would obviously know that house.
There was nothing random about that attack.
He's a native Washingtonian, married with three kids.
Everything to lose.
- Oh.
- What?
He's running for Congress.
And check out his campaign slogan.
"Let's do this." He said that on the tape.
This won't be easy.
You want to arrest James Stanworth?
Are you out of your mind?
He's got motive.
Mary Rutka had a tape.
She was blackmailing him.
It was a hooded figure.
You can't prove it was him on that videotape.
He fits the profile, Erin.
Forgive me, but your profile sounds like a self-made man, not the psychopath you claim he is.
We said he'd be destructive.
In 1998 alone, he fired 6,000 people from one of his companies.
Some of those employees took their own lives.
This is the type of power and devastation that he enjoys.
Hearsay.
Slander if you're not careful.
Ma'am, he got into politics to be hard on crime.
He would have access to keep tabs on Don Sanderson.
And now you're sounding as paranoid as Don Sanderson.
You cannot accuse a man without a shred of physical evidence.
Mary Rutka had skin under her nails.
Maybe she left a mark.
And you cannot arrest a man based on the possibility of a scratch.
We can't arrest this man.
That's what you mean.
Don't pull any punches now, Erin.
You don't understand what the politics are, do you, Dave?
You never have.
No, I do.
I just don't care.
Ma'am, all due respect, but we have an innocent man in our custody, and the killer is still out there.
It just might be James Stanworth.
You don't have enough proof.
The BAU functions without you.
Don't push it.
So there's nothing we can do?
This guy's gonna get away with it.
No.
No, not a chance in hell.
Garcia, find me James Stanworth right now.
Yeah.
Another hour passes, he's that much closer to hiding his true self.
Mary Rutka's his third victim.
He's now officially a serial killer.
- What do you want to do?
- I want to expose this son of a bitch.
If he did kill Mary Rutka, he's gonna have cuts on him somewhere.
We match that DNA, we got him.
Guys, he's having a fund-raiser
- at his house in McLean.
- When?
It started an hour ago.
- Text me the address.
- Yep.
What if we're wrong?
Prentiss.
Which is why I insisted they come to D.C., meet the policymakers, see that it's not as simple as signing our names, that the problems we're dealing with are not easy ones, that we have to plan not two steps ahead,
but 200 steps, that it's not just about what's in our families' best interests, it's what's in our nation's.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Congressman, Mr. James Stanworth.
You sure have a way with words.
It's mighty impressive.
Thank you.
- May I help you?
- My name's Derek Morgan.
We're with the FBI.
Do your friends here know that you're a closet psychopath?
Excuse me?
Don Sanderson does.
Do you remember him?
I'm sure you do.
You murdered his entire family and got him put away for 25 years.
Well, Agent, if you've got anything on me...
No.
James, it's not on you, it's inside of you.
Killing Mary Rutka really got you going, didn't it?
I'm afraid I don't know who that is.
- Jim, what's going on?
- They were just leaving.
- But I don't understand...
- Don't worry.
He's good at that, isn't he?
Anger.
He's dismissive by nature.
Can't show affection, though, can he?
You walk on eggshells, you and the children.
- Jim...
- Shut up!
Oh, here he comes.
Where was your husband today around 3:00?
These are ridiculous fabrications.
It doesn't matter.
We know where he was.
I held the hand of the woman he murdered.
Right.
James, whoever did kill Mary left some DNA behind under her fingernails.
- What's that?
- Well, that would be a cut.
I cut myself on a broken glass.
No.
Mary Rutka did that to you trying to defend herself.
You knew that Don Sanderson was out after 25 years.
He got to Tom Wittman, and you were afraid that if he got to Mary, he might find you and bring you down for what you did to his family all those years ago.
- You're delusional, Agent.
- You panicked, and you killed Mary.
- I don't panic.
- You did panic.
You're a killer.
It's what you do.
You destroy people's lives.
I destroyed no one.
You put a man away for life, you murdered his family, and today you killed a woman who would never betray you...
I killed no one....because you panicked.
You are a killer.
You are a psychopath.
You panicked, and...
I don't panic!
I don't panic!
There he is.
Jim, what's going on?
Shh!
Call Charles.
Don't say another word.
They've got nothing.
We found the tape.
James Stanworth, you're under arrest for the murder of Mary Rutka.
This is absurd.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney...
There hasn't been a second where I haven't thought about this.
Now it's here.
How does it feel?
I'm terrified.
You know, your son has been studying medicine.
He wants to open his own clinic.
It seems to me he's becoming a lot like his father.
I don't even know what he looks like.
Well, it looks like you're about to find out.
Yes, but I...
What am I supposed to say to him?
He knows that you didn't do it.
That's all you ever wanted him to know.
Yeah.
Go.
Show him who his dad really is.
Oh, my God.
Joshua.
All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered.
The point is to discover them.
Galileo.
You're late. I, uh... The appointment was eleven.
I didn't know if I was coming.
You picked a girl? Yes.
Tell me about her.
James.
The details.
I don't really want to.
- How old?
- How old is the girl? Young.
She's four.
Four-ish.
What was she wearing? When you first saw her?
When you chose her? A dress-Blue, yellow flowers.
Yellow and orange sandals.
Little sandals.
Running in a park, happy.
Why her? She's a child, that's the deal.
I thought she was young, she hasn't lived that long.
Maybe her parents wouldn't miss her as much.
Where does she live?
Do you have a plan? I followed them home-
- The girl, the parents.
My hands were shaking on the steering wheel as I followed them.
The address, as you asked.
Look, I don't know if I can do this.
You don't have to.
Remember that, James.
The hospital said that my son's cancer is in remission.
The hospital said that.
Well, that's good news.
So if I do this thing, my son will live.
That's the deal, James.
You're him, right? I beg your pardon? I hear they serve a great pastrami sandwich here.
Yes.
Jenny, how can I help you? I heard you can... do things.
I create opportunities for people to do things.
But you make things happen, like magic.
What do you want, Jenny? I want to be prettier.
Prettier.
How would you know when you're pretty enough? I would know.
So you want to know when you're pretty enough.
No.
I want to be prettier So, you want to become prettier, until you know you're pretty enough.
Yes.
That can happen.
Okay.
How? What we do is we make an arrangement.
A friend of mine said that's how it works.
Your friend's a client? No.
He heard from someone who had a friend whose sister you helped.
She said.
Hmm.
You're going to have to rob a bank.
What? I have no idea how to rob a bank.
How am I supposed to rob a bank? Well, maybe that's the first thing you'll do, is figure out how.
I'm not going to rob a bank.
Okay.
Anything else.
- No.
A bank.
- I need you to rob 101,043.
You want 101,043? No.
I want to hear about how you robbed 101,043.
Hello.
- Willem.
- Have you thought it over? Her.
I get her.
That's who you get? What do I have to do? I want you to help someone.
A child.
Help a kid? Yes.
Protect her, like a guardian angel.
What the hell are you talking about? If you want that woman, you will watch over a little girl.
You will find a way to become part of her life and you will protect her.
This is her address.
- Protect her?
- Protect her from what? From whatever is out there.
For how long? Let's say... ten weeks.
- No.
- This makes no sense.
How do I get into a kid's life? How do I not look like I'm stalking her? That's for you to figure out and then come tell me about.
So you want me to tell you about how it goes.
That's the deal.
- John -- the guy I met -
- I never saw a guy happier. Well-dressed, two broads on his arm.
He said it was all you.
It's not.
It's you.
Still.
Whatever.
I don't know that I believe you.
That's understandable.
But not my problem.
Give me something.
A token of proof or something.
- Start.
- See what happens.
Mrs. Tyler.
- Hello.
- How are you today?
- Well.
Well.
- It's been busy.
No.
Thank you.
Good.
Good.
And how are you doing? It's going well.
You found the material you need? You know, you can find almost anything and how to do anything on the Internet.
I've heard that.
It's hard to believe how much has changed in the years I've been alive.
I mean, Googling, Wikipedia.
You get curious about something, and it goes right into the next thing... I think it'll be ready by the end of next week.
You feel comfortable doing it? It isn't easy.
In what way? My hands shake.
And it's hard, sometimes, to concentrate. Mm-hmm.
Do you still think it's worth it? Oh, yes.
What do you think when you're doing it? What goes through your mind? I think about all those people dying.
I feel terrible about that.
I know it will be over quickly, but I worry about those who might linger.
Then I remember...
I just want him home.
He will be, yes?
After I do this thing? Yes.
Do you make everyone who comes to you hurt someone? No, only some.
Can I help you? I've heard the pastrami sandwich is really good here.
Melody.
So.
There's something you need? Money.
Enough to make my dad happy.
Can you give me more details? My friend Tiffany said that her friend's cousin's dad came to you and you helped him keep his house.
Mr. Conner? Yes.
How is he doing? He killed himself.
Oh.
And your father, he's not happy.
No.
Well, perhaps I can help.
What do I have to do? I offer you a task.
You do the task, you get what you want.
Tasks.
I need you to find a man who has shut himself into his home.
You mean, like- Like a shut-in.
That's all? First you have to find such a man.
And then you have to get him to leave the place he feels safest.
And my dad will be happy? If having enough money to make your father happy is what you want, then that is what you will have.
When do I start? Detective Grenier.
To hell with you.
I did it.
I did the thing.
So now what?
How do we wrap this up? You give me the details.
No.
We had a deal, Detective, remember? Lewis--"Sharky", they call him.
Inside for killing his girlfriend and her mother.
Was he your first choice? He was a bad guy, all right? I waited till the third shift, went in, made up some B.S. about a transfer.
Do you like to lie, Detective? I did it--what you said you wanted, all right? Not what I wanted.
You said you wanted -- No, I said if you did the task, you would get what you wanted.
Yeah, so where's the money? Detective, you didn't do it.
Didn't do what? You didn't kill him.
- All right.
- I got him out of jail -- And I believe that, because you did that.
But you didn't kill him.
How do you know that? Because if you had, you'd have the money.
I believe you took him out of jail and you had him transferred -- locked up, maybe.
But he's alive, or you'd have what you wanted.
Do you really want what you said you wanted? I need to know one thing.
All right.
How can I know you're not the Devil? You can't.
A man I know, a priest, he told me what -- how you helped him.
He said you worked a miracle.
I have been a nun for fifteen years.
I felt a calling when I was a child.
I lived to take my vows.
You must have been young, hmm? I used to feel God's presence everywhere.
I heard Him...
He was not a voice, but a comfort.
Now -- now I don't.
Do you want to leave your order? Do you want to leave?
- No.
- I want to hear God again.
Can you do that? Yes.
I can make an arrangement for that.
I make deals.
Do you want to make a deal? I was thinking how I was gonna do it.
Good.
You need a plan.
I mean, I don't want her to suffer, right? That would be up to you.
I was thinking something quick, but not messy, because that would complicate things.
- All right.
- Good thinking.
A plastic bag over her head.
What do you think?
Will that work?
- What do you think?
- That's what I care about.
I think I want my son to live.
Yeah, yeah.
For now... your son is safe.
Thank you.
I can't let my wife find out.
That would be your decision I have no idea how to rob a bank.
And no one knew how to walk when they were first born.
You're like a baby bank robber, learning to take your first step.
Listen, give me something else.
I don't want to rob a bank.
Then don't.
But I want what you'll give me if I do.
Then do... as we agreed.
How do I even start?
- That's not my job.
- It's not my job to help.
There was a TV show, "America's Most Wanted," about bank robbers and stuff.
Oh.
Start there.
If I get caught, I'm telling them you made me do it.
No, you won't.
Yes, I will.
I promise you, you won't.
Where do I buy a gun? Not my job to help.
Do you really think I can pull of a bank robbery? Jenny, by and large, I think people can do far more than they ever imagined.
I went to that address.
I sat in my car, watching the girl and her parents playing with her dog.
It was kind of strange, you know, watching this family from my car.
Strange in what way? I just thought, you know, someone might think I'm a perv or something, watching a little girl.
Are you a perv? No.
I told you, I want the girl in the centerfold.
Yes.
It was like my windshield was like a movie screen, you know? I was watching people be happy.
Willem, is that what you want, a happy family? That's not what I get, okay? I don't get that.
I don't get to be happy that way.
What kind of happy do you get? Different-Different is kind.
Is somebody after her? Excuse me? You asked me to protect her.
Is somebody after her? It's not my place to say.
Well, who's place is it? Yours, Willem.
It's your place to continue.
Or not.
I was wondering what happens if I don't do this thing you asked me to do.
If you don't do it? If I don't build this thing you asked me to build and use it.
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
- I don't know.
- Things would continue.
Your husband's Alzheimer's might continue to grow worse... or not.
Might get better.
No one said he might get better.
He can't get better.
There's no recovering from Alzheimer's.
No one said you can sustain a fall from an airplane, but people have.
Because he's old, you know, and I don't know how much longer he'll be able to stay with those people.
- Hmm.
- Yeah, I understand.
I just feel he doesn't have much time left.
Mm --mm.
And that's why I'm working so hard to make this thing. could I do anything else -
- I do something besides using this... bomb I built? You build the bomb.
I don't want to use it.
That's the deal, Mrs. Tyler.
You use it or not.
It's your choice.
I'll bring it to Andy's this weekend. that's the coffee shop you've chosen? There will be plenty of people.
Well, come back and tell me how it goes.
I will.
Of course I will.
That's the deal.
I need to know something.
Yes, James? If I kill this girl and I get caught, does my son still live? Yes.
Yes, he does.
I don't have to make this complicated, I could just walk up and shoot her.
You could, yes.
But I don't want my children to think I'm a killer.
I mean, if he lives and I'm in jail, that would be bad.
So you'll have to get away with it, huh? I want to be a good father.
I don't want my children to think I'm a bad man, so I have to do this carefully so I don't get caught.
Look, is this the kind of thing that you want to hear when you said I should tell you the details? It's the most important part, James, a person's thoughts.
It should be an accident.
All right, then.
Oh, that was amazing.
Mmm.
Your husband -- he's -- he's one lucky guy.
Mm.
Your wife...
Ah, she's one lucky girl.
I'm thirsty.
Want anything?
Be right back.
Oh.
Mm.
Hey, hey.
W-w-what is it?
What's going on?
Yo, dude.
You all right?
Ohh.
I was in my room doing homework.
Homework?
Really?
With your mom at work?
Okay.
So I was playing "Kinect Sports."
Ah, your secret's safe with me.
So, what, you're doing your homework, and this guy's just looking in your window?
Yeah, he had, like, long hair and some kind of neck tat, like a spider or something.
That's kind of specific.
You seen this guy before?
No.
Hi!
Uh, I'm gonna go with "party I wasn't invited to."
S-sort of.
Uh, Jeff had a little uninvited visitor peeking at him through the window.
Oh.
Why didn't you call me?
'Cause you were at work.
Yeah, but I can leave in an emergency.
Unless this wasn't an emergency.
Mom, no, I'm telling you, I saw the guy!
Okay.
Well, now we got the all clear, you can go on in and finish your homework.
Of course, you don't believe me.
No, I believe that you think you saw something.
But I want you to finish your homework, and say thank you to Jim...
Ohh.
Mm.
Sorry for the false alarm.
Really think he's crying wolf?
Well, he gets like this when he misses his dad.
I was supposed to take him last week, but between school and the job -- sorry.
Sounds tough.
Ah, he'll be fine.
No, I was talking about you.
Mm.
You want to come in and cool off?
Is there beer involved?
And chips and salsa, too, if you play your cards right.
Ohh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on.
No!
Yeah?
Really?
Well, I'm kind of in the middle of something, so...
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm on it.
Sorry, uh, I got a date with a dead guy.
Blown off for a dead guy.
Rain check on the beer?
We'll see.
If I play my cards right, huh?
Yeah.
Don't you have to go?
Just making sure you get home safe.
I'm like a foot from my door.
Never be too careful.
Right.
Here I go.
Some say I don't play well with others.
I was a damn good Detective in Chicago until a disagreement with my boss encouraged me to pack it up and make a change.
So I put the Windy City in my rearview and headed to the Sunshine State to kick back, play some golf, work on my tan, maybe write the occasional speeding ticket.
Yeah, well...
That didn't work out.
The Glades 1x08 Marriage Is Murder Original Air Date on August 29, 2010
Who's our friend here?
Got a male, 40s.
Somebody swiped his wallet, watch, keys, and judging from his tan line, his wedding ring.
Huh.
Puncture wounds.
A lot of them.
On his neck and chest.
Probably from a screwdriver or ice pick.
Wow.
Someone was really mad at this guy.
I can't imagine anyone being that mad at me.
Oh, yeah?
Try harder.
Nice jacket.
Nice?
It's a John Varvatos.
You're looking at about...
5 grand.
Jeans, boots, leather jacket.
All this season.
What?
My wife likes me styled up.
No blood splatter...
Here or on the wall.
No, the blood pooled inside his jacket.
I'm thinking the attack took place somewhere else.
The victim managed to make it this far before he died.
Did you talk to the motel manager?
Yeah.
He wasn't a guest.
And, uh, he hadn't seen this guy before.
We'll use his prints to get an I.D.
This the couple that found the body?
Yes, sir.
I got this.
Yes, sir.
Hi.
Detective Longworth.
I understand you guys found the body?
I-I did.
Y-yeah.
Did you hear or see anything?
Anyone suspicious?
No.
Not at all.
Oh.
You staying here?
At the motel?
In one of the rooms?
Look, man.
We're not married.
Okay.
I mean, we are...
It's just --
Hey.
None of my business.
Right?
Cool.
So, you think you could leave our names out of the report?
Ah.
That I can't do.
But unless your wife...
Or husband, starts to scour police reports, shouldn't be a problem.
Oh-ho.
That's sweet.
Uh, where were you guys earlier?
Uh, just across the street.
At Cancun's.
Is that where you met?
Yeah.
Two weeks ago.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, thank you.
Oh, and, uh...
Thank you, man.
Did they have anything to offer?
No, they were too busy cheating on their spouses to hear anything.
They met at the bar across the street.
Cheaters?
They met at cheaters?
Cancun Beach Club?
What?
That's what they call it.
"They"?
Whatever.
It's local knowledge.
Yeah, well, maybe our John Doe knew that, as well.
Whoo!
Yeah, the guy was a pig.
He kept grabbing my ass, so the bouncers tossed his ass.
Most people who come to Cancun's come to enjoy the beach.
Do a little people watching, check out each other's rides.
Heard it's also a good place for a little off-the-books hook-up.
Cheaters?
Yeah.
So maybe my guy chose the wrong guy's wife.
Your guy hit on everyone.
He pissed off people left and right.
He even ran off his friend.
They got into an argument, and the guy split.
Uh, you get a name, credit card receipt?
Nope.
Paid cash.
What were they fighting about?
Don't know.
But after he left, there was this other guy who got way too drunk, and he kept saying your victim wouldn't see nightfall.
Did you get a description of that guy?
Kind of scrawny, with, like, a flat-top.
And a scar over...
His right eye.
Don't even think about it, because the answer is no.
"No" what?
You don't have a wife, so I'm saying it for her.
No, you can't have a motorcycle.
Anyone with your attention span has no business riding anything like this.
Hey, I found out the victim was a world-class ass-wipe.
Well, there's plenty of those around.
And a guy with a flat-top and a scar over his right eye was threatening to kill him all afternoon.
Good to know.
Here's my prelim.
In addition to the stab wounds,
I also found needle marks in his hip.
Probably for diabetes, so I'm gonna fire off a tox report.
Excuse me.
I, um, have a wife to go home to.
Mm-hmm.
Listen, the guy's been to a lot of bars around here, so get crackin'.
Oh.
Already got it covered.
Got that surveillance video, Detective.
Hey, Dr. Sanchez.
I already hit a few bars, like you said.
I'll compare these to the three bar stamps on the victim's hand.
Then assemble a video timeline.
Have it for you in -- in a few hours.
Okay.
Good.
Go in there.
Match up these bikes with their owners.
What, just because of the leather jacket?
Our vic's too cleaned up to be a biker.
No, these bikes are too expensive to be owned by real bikers.
But rich, obnoxious ass-wipes that everybody hates?
Now, that shows real promise.
Gone through his entire last few hours.
This tape here gives us the best footage of our victim.
Here he comes.
And he looks pretty wasted.
An old enemy, maybe?
Or just somebody he met on the boardwalk and pissed off royally?
I haven't seen him with anyone I'd say looks even remotely close to a friend.
Looks like he was picking fights with everyone.
Uh, anything else on the scrawny guy with the scar and the flat-top?
Nothing.
But I cross-checked all motorcycles with their owners.
All present and accounted for.
Yeah.
There's something about that leather jacket.
A $2,500 leather jacket doesn't mean he rides.
It just means he's rich.
And obnoxious.
Someone a bunch of people clearly hated enough to want him dead.
A bunch of people.
Mm-hmm.
This isn't "Murder on the Orient Express."
He was just a jackass!
Maybe he pissed off a gang of real bikers.
Real bikers stay clear of nice places like Cancun's.
Hey, I put our vic's prints on the wire.
Now, he's not in the system as a criminal, but I did get something else -- really?
Really?
Do you always have to do that?
I got a hit from the D.A. in Palm Beach.
He did an internship there years ago when he was at the University of Miami Law School.
Was he a prosecutor?
Divorce attorney.
Biggest in the state.
Allan Slater, 51, of Palm Beach, Florida.
A ruthless divorce attorney, someone who made millions out of tearing families apart and destroying people's lives.
I'm thinking half the state of Florida wanted this guy dead.
Mrs. Slater?
Yes?
Jim Longworth.
With the FDLE.
Let me guess.
Something happened to Allan?
How'd you know?
'Cause you're a cop knocking on my front door, and he's a divorce attorney who has a knack for destroying people's lives.
Had a knack.
He's dead.
Cancun's.
That figures.
Nothing good ever comes out of that place.
Not the cheating kind, huh?
Maybe your husband was.
Not that I know of.
Or at least that you'd ever caught him at.
Or maybe you did.
Nope.
My husband was a divorce attorney, Detective.
Cancun's is a place where people go to cut loose, escape from their unhappy marriages.
Maybe he was trawling for business.
Oh, without his wife,
I'm sure he was trawling for something.
Empty-headed beach bunnies, maybe?
I wouldn't be caught dead there.
Interesting choice of words.
You know, I normally get more emotion from victims' wives.
Which means you think I had something to do with his death.
Did you?
No.
Do you need my alibi?
Yeah.
You got one lying around?
I know how this works.
I was a crime reporter for Channel 8 in Miami.
Interviewed a lot of cops.
I know how you think.
Wow.
That actually makes me feel a little uncomfortable.
So, you being the hot, on-air reporter on television -- is that how you first got on your husband's radar?
Allan saw something he wanted, he took it.
Look, just because I'm not sad he's gone, doesn't mean I'm happy about it, either.
We had an arrangement.
Ah.
Prenup, I'm guessing.
A generous one.
Allan was very fair to all of his wives.
I knew what I was getting into.
Allan diabetic?
No.
Testosterone.
He liked to feel invincible.
Who doesn't, right?
Mm.
So, Allan 'roided out.
Geez.
Must have been fun to live with.
Not bad if he's on your side.
Probably made a few enemies along the way.
Any stand out?
Take your pick.
What's in there?
Dirt.
On judges, clients, lawyers, anybody he needed to hurt.
Can I take this?
I don't have the password anyway.
Ho!
Allan did own a bike.
A bike.
Try "his baby."
Bought it for $400,000, spent another $100,000 fixing it up.
500 grand for a bike?
Certainly didn't see it at the crime scene.
Trust me.
Allan would never give up his bike without a fight.
Maybe someone killed him when they stole it.
Wow.
You do know how we think.
You ever heard of these?
Uh, chasteberry.
Sure.
If I were taking them, what would that say about me?
That you had tender breasts, irritability, possible bloating.
Uh, is that possible side effects of steroids?
No.
Of being a woman.
Oh.
So it's like an herbal birth control to keep you chaste?
It's the opposite.
It's to help you get pregnant.
Oh, are you thinking about starting a family?
Someday.
No, this is wife trouble.
For my dead guy.
Ah.
How's that going?
Slowly.
He was a divorce attorney.
'Cause no one wants to kill them.
How's Jeff doing?
He's fine.
He's a little spooked about coming home to an empty house, but he'll get over it.
He always does.
Are you sure he was crying wolf?
Are you trying to scare me, too?
Yeah.
A little.
I found a pair of boot prints near one of your windows.
It -- this was on Tuesday?
Yeah.
Tuesday.
Tuesday.
Tuesday is when the bug guy comes and sprays the entire perimeter of my house.
And trust me --
I know how bad guys operate.
And I haven't noticed any unusual activity in the neighborhood, and Jeff does have a history of crying wolf.
He called me three times last week.
All right.
You know what?
If Jeff is spooked about going back to an empty house, why doesn't he come to the station after school?
Hang out.
I don't want him "hanging out" after school.
Oh, yeah, 'cause a kid can get into so much trouble at a police station.
You know what I mean.
Okay.
Fine.
Just make sure he finishes his homework.
Absolutely.
No question.
Right.
Daniel.
Find our victim's bike?
Sort of.
I found Craig Daniels,
Slater's trainer and bike mechanic.
At least according to Florida Law Journal.
Sounds like he's the friend Slater fought with the night of the murder.
And...
Hold it.
Breathe.
Nice.
Craig Daniels?
Jim Longworth.
Later, jerk.
Can't you see I'm at work?
Well, no, I can see you're actually putting this poor Lady through unnecessary rigor just so you can stare at her ass.
See?
I'm working, too.
Take five, babe.
And you hydrate.
What the hell do you want?
Well, for starters, Popeye, you can take your tone down a notch.
Pretty smart mouth for a guy I could snap in two.
What, did you bring backup?
No.
Just me.
What the hell do you want?
I understand you and your boss were involved in a fight at Cancun's Beach Club.
Wasn't a fight.
You do know he was murdered...
Right?
I didn't hear from him, so...
I figured something was wrong.
But he's not my boss.
I train him.
Yeah.
You also take care of his bike.
"Take care of"?
I rebut that thing from scratch.
That bike is a museum piece thanks to me.
Phew!
Then you must be pretty pissed off when he gets the covers and all the accolades.
Your name?
Barely mentioned once.
His money, his bike.
Yeah.
Your talent, your hard work.
Everyone i talked to about him says he's a real dick.
Well, they didn't know him like I did.
See, we grew up two houses apart in Astatula.
We were like brothers.
Well, what did you two "brothers" fight over the night he was murdered?
He was drinking too much.
I told him to stop, and he wouldn't.
So you weren't exactly "brothers."
Were you?
I mean, you cleaned up his messes, polished his bike.
He was your meal ticket.
He was my partner.
I train a lot of rich trophy wives.
If I found one that was a little unhappy in her marriage,
I'd churn her a little bit.
I fed the business to Allan.
Messing around with people's marriages your idea of sport, sport?
You know what they say -- all's fair.
Why shouldn't my buddy make some cash?
Oh, I don't know, 'cause sometimes maybe innocent children are involved?
And I want to open my own gym.
And Allan was gonna co-sign on a loan.
So you tell me, smart guy, why would I kill him?
I don't know.
Oh, hey.
Maybe the half million dollars you'd get if you sold his bike, an Eddie Trotta that's missing.
"Baby"?
You think I killed my friend over Baby?
Baby?
Yeah.
That's what he called his bike.
Excuse me for a second.
Daniel.
You know that password we were looking for?
Try b-a-b-y.
We were able to crack his notebook, and we found...
Wade Conners.
He owned four Harley dealerships in Florida before the divorce.
That the guy who threatened to kill your divorce attorney?
Thanks to Allan Slater, he lost his business, his home, his family, ended up bankrupt and in rehab, all thanks to our dead divorce attorney.
Mm.
He also has a history of violence.
His ex-wife filed a restraining order on him.
So where's Wade now?
Fixing Sea-Doos in Orlando.
So I call the dealership -- he hasn't turned up for a couple of days.
Nice.
I got a couple of plainclothes FDLE guys down at Cancun's, making sure that no one there is protecting the guy, or that Wade's not stupid enough to return.
Oh, where are you going?
To warn Wade Conners' ex-wife.
Killer Bronco.
Jim Longworth.
FDLE.
I'm guessing you're not Wade Conners.
Uh, Shane.
Wade's my dad.
I'm looking for your dad.
Is he here?
No, he's not allowed to come here.
Why not?
Came by last week when I was at school, drunk off his ass.
Got in a fight with my mom.
Broke the window.
Oh.
Makes sense.
If I'd have lost this place to a divorce,
I'd be pretty pissed off, too.
Uh, you have any idea where I can find him?
Don't know.
Don't care.
Is your mom around?
She's with her boyfriend.
Where that is, is anybody's guess, huh?
You know, I used to have one of these in college.
Mine was a straight-six.
What's this?
302.
Ho.
V8.
This baby yours?
Yeah.
I got it for being good.
What, like a bribe?
What for?
For allowing my soon-to-be stepdad to move us to L.A.
As soon as the school year's over.
And you're not happy about that.
Well, it is L.A.
Look, I'm sorry, but my dad's not here.
You know, I-I got to go clean up you know, do my homework.
Sure.
Hey, I-I need to get ahold of your mom.
Do you have her number?
Yeah.
Uh, 561...
Ah, I got no bars.
I hate my carrier.
Uh, can I use your phone?
Yeah, my mom's number's in there.
Cool.
Thanks.
Won't be a second.
Yeah?
Hey, where are you?
I got your 20 bucks.
Who's this?
Uh, it's Jim.
You loaned me 20 bucks.
I want to pay you back.
All right.
All right.
Yeah, you at Cancun's?
Yeah!
Our guy's at Cancun's.
You know, it's pretty crowded in here.
Raise your hand so I can see you.
All right.
He's the guy with his hand in the air.
We got him.
Ow!
What are you --
What are you guys doing?
!
Hey.
Thanks.
I left a message.
Yeah.
Hey, be good.
Oh, my gosh.
There really are 3,000 guys with neck tats.
Yeah, and that's just in the state of Florida.
Are you gonna be all right here?
I-I need to go see a guy.
It's a police station.
What could happen?
Hey, uh, keep looking.
Let me know if you find your guy, all right?
Okay.
Hey, Wade!
Feel like I got an ax stuck in my head.
That how you got your scar?
I don't recall.
Or maybe when you busted a window on that really nice house you used to have.
You know, the one that Slater hijacked, along with your Harley franchises, your home, your family...
I didn't kill him, okay?
!
I got a witness saying that they heard you planned to.
Come on.
Admit it.
You went to Cancun's to get him back, didn't you?
I went there to get my life back, to get my son's respect back.
You know what it's like to fail your kid?
Not really.
You want to tell me?
I went away to rehab.
Anger management.
When I got back,
I had to work three jobs just to pay back the lawyers.
Barely even saw Shane.
He thought I didn't care anymore.
What was your plan?
Shane and I always talked about this invention I had in my head.
We called it the super muffler.
Cuts emissions, improves mileage.
So I sold my truck.
Made a prototype.
Came down here to see if I could get some investors.
But I never got the chance.
Stopped off for lunch...
And saw that bald, shiny head in the crowd.
I always said, if I ever saw that bastard outside a courtroom,
I would...
So you followed him.
I had a drink...
To steady my nerves, which I hadn't done in months.
And I ran my mouth, trying to work myself up to it.
Then I got too drunk.
Passed out in my van.
Great alibi, Wade.
Way to win your son's respect back.
You talk to Shane?
Is he okay?
Yeah, I did.
He's a great kid.
No thanks to you.
Are you crazy?
Ray, he's 7!
Come on.
He'll be fine.
We're just going to the end of the block and back.
Right?
Yeah.
All right.
You ready?
Yeah!
All right.
Ray.
Ray!
Honey.
He can do this.
All right?
I got it.
All right.
Come on.
Be so careful.
So you watching that again, huh?
You know this Sorento has literally, like, hundreds of stations and a satellite radio?
Or the mp3 jack, you can listen to whatever you want.
Or we could talk.
Jeff, you don't need to start that again.
We're almost home.
You lied to me.
What are you talking about?
You lied to me.
You said that dad was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
That he made a stupid mistake.
He made a lot of stupid mistakes, didn't he?
Look, I saw dad's arrest report at the police station, okay?
Jim showed you?
Don't blame Jim!
Mom, don't blame anybody!
Just blame yourself!
You're the one who's been lying to me!
Honey, I was trying to protect you.
You don't need to know about all of that.
All of what?
That dad's done so many stupid things in his life that he may never get out?
He's going to get out.
Why should I believe you?
You're just a liar.
Jeff, come back here.
You still don't have the time of death?
What the hell's taking so long?
It's tricky.
I can't use liver temp or digestion because he hadn't eaten.
Which leaves me with livor mortis and a potassium eye test.
So we're waiting on lab results.
What difference does it make?
I heard you caught the guy.
Yeah.
The ex-husband.
I mean, he's got motive out the Ying Yang, but I'm light on facts.
I got him on public intox, but, uh, that's only 'cause he's too broke to make bail.
I've been running profiles on potential murder weapons based on the depth and angle of the victim's stab wounds.
The wounds are cleaved but very shallow.
So it could be a small pocket knife or a specialty kitchen tool.
So the main form of death is still stabbing?
I can't tell conclusively till I nail a time of death, and I can't confirm that until -- until you get the lab results.
All right.
Thanks.
So, what do we do now?
What we should have done hours ago -- get a beer.
Sorry I'm late.
Line for the men's room is murder.
So to speak.
Right.
Good one.
Which is why, if I had to go, I'd come back here.
Me too.
Bring your blood kit?
Yeah.
Oh.
You mean -- yeah.
Yeah.
Hey!
Hey, guys!
Over here!
Hi.
Come on up.
We're doing shooters.
Oh.
Sorry.
We're on a bit of a tear here.
Ohh.
That's no fun.
Oh, you have no idea.
That's a good bird's-eye view from up there.
Did you get the surveillance tape on the patrons from the bar up there?
Da-
- Daniel?
Hey.
What?
Oh.
Uh, no.
No.
Not -- not -- not here at the Iguana Café.
Not up there?
Not -- not there.
Um, I-I focused on places the victim had been based on the bar stamps on his hand.
But I will get them for you as soon as I am done...
Here.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Tox screens and lab results.
About time.
Cause of death.
Uh, maybe not.
The tox screens found crystallized tubules in his kidneys.
Meaning what?
Meaning he was poisoned with antifreeze.
Stabbed and poisoned?
That's weird.
You know what else is weird?
Slater had a vasectomy.
So?
So, he was taking steroid shots to prove to the world how big his cajones are.
I mean, even for an attorney, that's a pretty big conflict of interest, right?
Don't get me started on them.
Thanks to a "Dateline" clip on Youtube, everyone knows if you're gonna poison someone, antifreeze is the way to go.
How would you mask the taste?
It's actually pretty easy because it's so sweet.
Its active ingredient is ethylene glycol.
It's a toxic form of alcohol.
What about the color?
Yeah, you can mix it with Mountain Dew or Red Bull.
Or Revitalade.
Oh.
Regarding the surveillance video?
Um, I've run through the entire day of the murder, and no sign of Slater or his buddy Craig Daniels.
Whoa.
Freeze it.
Enlarge it.
Go back.
Go back.
Back, back, back, back.
There.
Well, if it isn't Mrs. Allan Slater...
Who said she'd never be caught dead on the boardwalk.
What happened to the butterfly tattoo?
Excuse me?
Is there something I can do for you, Detective?
We got a break in your husband's case.
Turns out, he was poisoned.
Poisoned.
You sure?
Positive.
Good choice.
Ripe.
Good news is, is that a poisoner fits a very narrow profile -- someone who's close to him, someone who couldn't confront him but was very intimate with his habits -- you know, what he liked to eat or...
Drink.
Sound like anyone you know?
Okay, so I like Revitalade.
Oh, forgot the best part.
A picture of you looking very unlike you.
That kind of inspired us to look at surveillance on the day that your husband was murdered.
Looks like you could be caught dead at Cancun's, after all.
Hmm?
You thought that just by putting on a hootchy skirt and a $10 Henna tattoo that you could undo eight years of neglect and 'roided-out abuse?
I wanted him to see that i have a carefree, beach-bunny side, too.
Probably hard to feel all beach bunny-ish with that biological clock ticking in your ears.
Found it on your kitchen counter...
Alongside the folic acid, selenium.
Herbal fertility supplements.
I take them for PMS.
Or to get pregnant, which is what it's starting to sound like to me.
You're the fourth Mrs. Allan Slater.
You saw the prenuptial writing on the wall, so you came up with a plan "B" -- as in "baby."
That way Allan would have to pay child support, not to mention the house, the Land Rover.
If I wanted to have his baby, why would I kill him?
Because you found out he got snipped -- as in the vasectomy.
And that really pissed you off.
Okay, I went there to confront him.
But that's all.
For all of our fighting, we had great makeup sex.
I saw him drinking, having a good time.
He never drinks.
A high-powered lawyer that doesn't drink?
His body was his temple, or so he thought.
He never put anything into his body that his trainer, Craig, didn't provide.
We're not open yet.
So, you got the loan, after all.
That's weird, 'cause I found your application in the trash folder of Allan's computer.
How the hell did you find this place?
I'm good.
Well, that, and the office intern made some calls.
Found out that despite you being turned down for a loan, you recently signed a lease on this place.
You come into some cash?
I got nothing more to say to you.
Ah, I bet you do, actually.
Well, your bro Allan was just murdered, so we know the money didn't come from him.
Do I smell something?
Like gas, maybe.
Hey, stay away from that.
Yeah, yeah, definitely gas.
Hey.
Hey.
Unless you got a warrant, you're about to lose your arm.
Actually, don't need a warrant, sport.
Not for a public health violation.
Ugh!
Ohh, baby!
Ah.
Hmm.
Oh, yeah!
I'm sure he had his reasons for not co-signing on the loan.
Yeah, he was an ass-wipe.
All you were to him was a lackey from Astatula who reminded him of how far he'd come.
And, hey, why be rich if you can't rub it in someone's face?
That what you guys were fighting about that night?
I told you.
He was drinking.
Which he'd only do with your permission.
Our lab found high levels of alcohol in his blood.
Not the kind that you get from a bar, but ethyl glycol, the kind you get at pep boys.
Which give you the same woozy effects as if you've been drinking.
So you guys, uh, had one last workout.
You got pumped for a sun-and-surf day at Cancun's, and you poisoned him with antifreeze, which pairs really well with Revitalade.
If we test this for trace ethylene glycol, with your prints all over it, we got you for murder.
Yeah.
Forget poisoning.
That's not the cause of death.
Ah, man.
Sorry.
Not murder.
Thanks.
But attempted murder.
And this time, I did bring backup.
All right, let's go.
A tension pneumothorax?
Yeah, one of the stab wounds nicked his lung cavity, causing a small leak.
It took me a while to find it.
He basically suffocated.
Yeah, before the antifreeze killed him?
Yep.
We also swept the alley, found both Slater and Wade Conners' blood.
He must've stabbed him there.
You run the DNA?
Uh, not yet.
Wade's ab negative.
It's a rare type, only 1% of the population.
Yeah, I don't know.
Yeah, no, it's rare.
I'm telling you.
No, no, no, I mean, I don'--
I don't totally buy Wade's guilt.
What's not to buy?
You said he had motive, right?
I believe your legal term was "out the Ying Yang."
Yeah.
Then I found this.
"Super muffler"?
Yeah.
He invented it.
He was bringing it down here to find investors.
I mean, this guy had a plan.
He was -- he was trying to make a fresh start.
Just because it was an old wound doesn't mean it's healed.
Hey.
Can I talk to you?
Sure.
Mugshots?
That's what you thought would ease Jeff's mind?
I just thought if Jeff felt more in control of his situation --
Jim, he saw his dad's arrest and conviction report.
What?
No, no, no.
That's impossible.
I specifically blocked him from that.
Oh, my God.
He's 13!
He's found more ways around parental control than I can come up with.
And, no, you know what?
Before you apologize, I want you to hear me.
My son's heart is broken, and he's pissed off at me for lying to him for all these years, and I don't blame him!
All right, I'm sorry.
I-I mean, you're right.
You're absolutely right.
I...
Look, that's not what I meant to happen.
Please.
I know you're only trying to help.
But, please, stop fanning Jeff's insecurities by looking for some phantom peeping Tom.
Sorry.
Oh, no, I meant, "sorry, you're still not off the hook."
I didn't poison him.
That was Craig.
And I heard you have the killer in custody.
A suspect, yeah.
Who threatened my husband all day.
Well, that's because your husband was a divorce attorney who made his fortune out of destroying people's lives -- you know, like the guy we got in custody.
A fortune that's now entirely yours.
Huh.
I told you, we have a prenup.
Death trumps a prenup.
You know that.
Unless ol' Allan was planning on giving it all to charity.
Yeah, I really didn't think so.
I gave up my career to be Mrs. Allan Slater.
Yeah, and then when you realized that you couldn't, that all you had left was the bluster and emotional abuse of a man that was never gonna change, you thought,
"man, why won't the prick just die?
"Then it could all be mine -- the money, the firm, the 'baby,'" so to speak.
Fine.
But you needn't bother telling me not to leave town.
I know -- you know how we think.
Yeah, got it.
Why is Daniel looking at a Federal database for violent crimes?
'Cause Callie made me promise that i wouldn't.
You know, I've never been married, but from what I've seen, divorce can be pure hell.
You got scumbag lawyers that are keeping the meter running, pushing dates, filing motions, keeping those wounds nice and fresh.
In the end, gets to the point where that person you loved, you hate so much, you'll give anything and everything just to get away from them -- your business, your house, your money.
But there is one thing that you'll fight to the death for -- your son.
No way a guy like you lets your ex-wife take your son interstate...
Unless a ruthless divorce attorney makes it so you don't have a choice.
So you used your whole life savings fighting for Shane, and just like that, Slater just steals your son.
So...
You killed him.
I can't confess to something I didn't do.
You spent the whole day threatening to kill him.
Then at 6:00, someone finds his body, and no one can vouch for where you were after 5:00?
And we also got your blood type in the alley where he got stabbed, and we got your blood type on his clothes.
My blood type?
As in DNA?
Well, kind of, but enough to get a court order so we can test and determine a DNA profile.
When we get that, we can prove with 99% accuracy who followed him into that alley and who killed Allan Slater.
You don't have to do the test.
I can't take this anymore.
Hey.
Nice work on the confession.
Uh, hello?
I said nice job?
You know, everyone's always so down on television.
But it's really helped educate the public on how forensics work.
What the hell are you talking about?
Excuse me.
Uh, uh...
You're welcome.
Got a hot date?
Pimping your ride.
Look, I told you, all right?
My dad's not here.
Oh, yeah, I know.
He confessed to killing Allan Slater.
He's going away for good this time.
Th-that's too bad...
For him.
I know you're not half as pissed at your dad as you pretend to be.
That's why you specifically asked for the old truck.
'Cause when you were little...
He had one.
Hoo.
How'd you get that bump on your head?
What, you get in a fight?
Just being stupid.
Behind Cancun's, maybe?
See, we found blood there that we matched to your dad's type.
But when I explained to him that we could test it, find out who really killed Allan Slater, he confessed before we could test for DNA.
'Cause it was your blood, wasn't it, Shane?
So, you want to tell me what really happened?
Or are you good with your dad going away forever?
That son of a bitch.
It wasn't enough he had to ruin my dad's life.
No, no, he had to keep us apart, too.
My dad saw that bastard go into Cancun's, and...
He called me up, and he said that, uh -- that he was gonna fix that sorry ass for good.
He'd been drinking, so I called him all day, over and over, but he wouldn't answer.
And I thought he might do something stupid.
So you drove over there.
I saw that bastard go into the alley to take a leak.
Then I warned him about my dad, but h-h-he wouldn't listen.
He just kept laughing at me and -- and saying that talking to him broke the custody agreement, that he was gonna have my dad arrested.
I got mad.
You know, I-I-I shoved that son of a bitch.
And his face got all red, and he pinned me up against the wall, said he was gonna kick my skinny ass.
You were scared for your life.
I couldn't breathe.
I-I just wanted him to let go of me.
Look, this is all my fault.
All right?
My -- my -- my dad can't go to jail for this.
No, it's not entirely your fault.
I mean, Slater attacked you.
He threatened your life.
You did what anyone would do.
You defended yourself.
Look, no promises, son.
But you help us out on this, you'll go a long way to making the prosecution and a judge see things in a favorable light.
That way, maybe you and your dad can have that second chance.
Starting with this.
The super muffler?
He built it?
Yeah, he did.
It's a hell of an idea, too.
He actually built it.
Daniel, go home.
Not paying you enough to stay this late.
Actually, I don't get paid at all.
Really?
Hmm.
I think you should see this, though.
Vicap got a hit on your tattoo guy -
- William Cobb.
He's on parole after serving four years for armed robbery and sexual assault.
His last known address is a trailer park just a few miles up the road.
Daniel, whatever they're not paying you, it's still not enough.
Don't move, or you're dead.
Drop it.
You got this all wrong, pal.
She's my girlfriend.
Shut up, asshole.
Dude, chill, I was just gonna -- you were just gonna shut up!
Ugh!
Aah!
Suspect in custody.
Thanks for setting up surveillance on the place.
Hey, uh, do me a favor?
Read him his rights.
I'll check on the occupants, make sure they're safe.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be use against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you.
That was amazing.
Your husband, he's...
He's one lucky guy.
Your wife...
She's one lucky girl.
I'm thirsty.
Want anything?
Be right back.
What?
Hey, hey!
What is it?
What's going on?
Yo, dude?
You all right?
I was in my room doing homework.
Homework?
Really?
Your mom at work.
Okay, so I was playing Kinect Sports.
Ah, your secret's safe with me.
So, what, you're doing your homework, and this guy's just looking in your window?
Yeah.
He had, like, long hair and some kind of neck tat, like a spider or something.
That's kind of specific.
You seen this guy before?
No.
Hi.
Uh, I'm gonna go with "party I wasn't invited to."
Sort of.
Jeff had a little uninvited visitor peeking at him through the window.
- Oh.
Why didn't you call me?
- 'Cause you were at work.
Yeah, but I can leave in an emergency.
Unless this wasn't an emergency.
Mom, no, I'm telling you, I saw the guy!
Okay.
Well, now we got the all clear.
You can go on in and finish your homework.
Of course you don't believe me.
No, I believe that you think you saw something.
But I want you to finish your homework.
And say thank you to Jim...
- Hmm.
- Sorry for the false alarm.
You really think he's crying wolf?
Well, he gets like this when he misses his dad.
I was supposed to take him last week, but between school and the job...
- Sorry.
Sounds tough.
- Nah, he'll be fine.
I was talking about you.
Mmm.
You want to come in and cool off?
- Is there beer involved?
- And chips and salsa, too... if you play your cards right.
Whoa, whoa.
Hang on.
No.
Yeah?
Really?
Well, I'm kind of in the middle of something, so...
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm on it.
Sorry.
Got a date with a dead guy.
- Blown off for a dead guy.
- Rain check on the beer?
We'll see.
If I play my cards right, huh?
Yeah.
Don't you have to go?
Just making sure you get home safe.
I'm, like, a foot from my door.
Never be too careful.
Right.
Here I go.
Some say I don't play well with others.
I was a damn good detective in Chicago... until a disagreement with my boss encouraged me... to pack it up and make a change.
So I put the Windy City in my rearview and headed to the Sunshine State.
Kick back.
Play some golf.
Work on my tan.
Maybe write the occasional speeding ticket.
Yeah.
Well, that didn't work out.
Who's our friend here?
Got a male, 40s.
Somebody swiped his wallet, watch, keys... and, judging from his tan line, his wedding ring.
Huh.
Puncture wounds.
A lot of them.
To his neck and chest.
Probably from a screwdriver or ice pick.
Wow.
Someone was really mad at this guy.
Couldn't imagine anyone being that mad at me.
Oh, yeah?
Try harder.
Nice jacket.
Nice?
It's a John Varvatos.
You're looking at about... five grand.
Jeans, boots, leather jacket...
all this season.
What?
My wife likes me styled up.
No blood splatter... here or on the wall.
No.
The blood pooled inside his jacket.
I'm thinking the attack took place somewhere else.
The victim managed to make it this far before he died.
Did you talk to the motel manager?
Yeah.
He wasn't a guest.
And he hadn't seen this guy before.
We'll use his prints to get an I.D.
- This the couple that found the body?
- Yes, sir.
- I got this.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
Detective Longworth.
I understand you guys found the body.
I did, yeah.
Did you hear or see anything?
Anyone suspicious?
No.
Not at all.
Oh.
You staying here... at the motel?
In one of the rooms?
Look, man.
We're not married.
- Okay.
- I mean, we are.
It's just...
Hey, none of my business, right?
Cool.
So, you think you could leave our names out of the report?
Ah.
That I can't do.
But unless your wife or husband starts to scour police reports, shouldn't be a problem.
- That's sweet.
- Uh, where were you guys earlier?
Uh, just across the street, at Cancun's.
- Is that where you met?
- Yeah.
Two weeks ago, yeah.
Okay.
Well, thank you.
Oh, and, uh...
Thank you, man.
They have anything to offer?
No, they were too busy cheating on their spouses to hear anything.
Met at the bar across the street.
Cheaters?
They met at Cheaters?
Cancun Beach Club?
What?
That's what they call it.
- "They"?
- Whatever.
It's local knowledge.
Yeah, well, maybe our John Doe knew that as well.
Whoo!
Yeah.
The guy was a pig.
He kept grabbing my ass, so the bouncers tossed his ass.
Most people who come to Cancun's come to enjoy the beach... do a little people-watching, check out each other's rides.
Heard it's also a good place for a little off-the-books hook-up.
- Cheaters?
Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
So maybe my guy chose the wrong guy's wife.
Your guy hit on everyone.
He pissed off people left and right.
He even ran off his friend.
They got into an argument, and the guy split.
You get a name, credit card receipt?
Nope.
Paid cash.
What were they fighting about?
Don't know.
But after he left, there was this other guy... who got way too drunk, and he kept saying your victim wouldn't see nightfall.
You got a description of that guy?
Kinda scrawny with, like, a flattop.
And a scar over his right eye.
Don't even think about it, because the answer is no.
No, what?
You don't have a wife, so I'm saying it for her.
No, you can't have a motorcycle.
Anyone with your attention span has no business riding anything like this.
- Hey, I found out the victim was a world-class ass-wipe.
- There's plenty of those around.
And a guy with a flattop and a scar over his right eye... was threatening to kill him all afternoon.
Good to know.
Here's my prelim.
In addition to the stab wounds, I also found needle marks on his hip.
Probably for diabetes.
So I'm going to fire off a tox report.
- Excuse me.
I, um, have a wife to go home to.
- Mm-hmm.
Listen, the guy's been to a lot of bars around here, so get crackin'.
Ah.
I already got it covered.
Got that surveillance video, Detective.
Hey, Dr. Sanchez.
I already hit a few bars like you said.
I'll compare these to the three bar stamps on the victim's hand, then assemble a video timeline.
Have it for you in a few hours.
Okay, good.
Go in there.
Match up these bikes with their owners.
What, just because of the leather jacket?
Our vic's too cleaned up to be a biker.
No, these bikes are too expensive to be owned by real bikers.
But rich, obnoxious ass-wipes that everybody hates?
Now, that shows real promise.
Gone through his entire last few hours.
This tape here gives us the best footage of our victim.
Here he comes.
And he looks pretty wasted.
An old enemy, maybe?
Or just someone he met on the boardwalk and pissed off royally?
I haven't seen him with anyone I'd say looks even remotely close to a friend.
Looks like he was picking fights with everyone.
All right.
Anything else on the scrawny guy with the scar and the flattop?
Nothing.
But I cross-checked all motorcycles with their owners.
All present and accounted for.
Yeah, there's something about that leather jacket.
A $2,500 leather jacket doesn't mean he rides.
Just means he's rich.
And obnoxious.
Someone a bunch of people clearly hated enough to want him dead.
- "A bunch of people"?
- Mm-hmm.
This isn't Murder on the Orient Express.
Hewasjustajackass.
Maybe he pissed off a gang of real bikers.
Real bikers stay clear of nice places like Cancun's.
Hey, I put our vic's prints on the wire.
Now, he's not in the system as a criminal, but I did get something else...
Really?
Really?
Do you always have to do that?
I got a hit from the D.A. in Palm Beach.
He did an internship there years ago when he was at the University of Miami Law School.
- Was he a prosecutor?
- Divorce attorney.
Biggest in the state.
Allan Slater, 51, of Palm Beach, Florida.
A ruthless divorce attorney... someone who made millions out of tearing families apart... and destroying people's lives?
I'm thinking half the state of Florida wanted this guy dead.
As in, "a bunch of people."
- Mrs. Slater?
- Yes?
Jim Longworth with the F.D.L.E.
Let me guess.
Something happen to Allan?
- How'd you know?
- 'Cause you're a cop knocking on my front door... and he's a divorce attorney who has a knack for destroying people's lives.
Had a knack.
He's dead.
Cancun's.
That figures.
Nothing good ever comes out of that place.
Not the cheating kind, huh?
Maybe your husband was.
- Not that I know of.
- Or at least that you'd ever caught him at.
- Or maybe you did.
- Nope.
My husband was a divorce attorney, Detective.
Cancun's is a place where people go to cut loose... escape from their unhappy marriages.
Maybe he was trawling for business.
Oh, without his wife?
I'm sure he was trawling for something.
Empty-headed beach bunnies, maybe?
I wouldn't be caught dead there.
Interesting choice of words.
You know, I normally get more emotion from victims' wives.
Which means you think I had something to do with his death.
- Did you?
- No.
Do you need my alibi?
Yeah.
You got one lying around?
I know how this works.
I was a crime reporter for Channel 8 in Miami.
Interviewed a lot of cops.
I know how you think.
Wow.
That actually makes me feel a little uncomfortable.
So, you being the hot on-air reporter on television... that how you first got on your husband's radar?
Allan saw something he wanted, he took it.
Look, just because I'm not sad he's gone doesn't mean I'm happy about it either.
- We had an arrangement.
- Ah.
Prenup, I'm guessing.
A generous one.
Allan was very fair to all of his wives.
- I knew what I was getting into.
- Allan diabetic?
No.
Testosterone.
He liked to feel invincible.
- Who doesn't, right?
- Hmm.
So, Allan roided out.
Geez.
Must have been fun to live with.
Not bad if he's on your side.
Probably made a few enemies along the way.
Any stand out?
Take your pick.
What's in there?
Dirt... on judges, clients, lawyers.
Anybody he needed to hurt.
- Can I take this?
- I don't have the password anyway.
Ho!
Allan did own a bike.
A bike?
Try his baby.
Bought it for $400,000, spent another 100,000 fixing it up.
500 grand for a bike?
Certainly didn't see it at the crime scene.
Trust me, Allan would never give up his bike without a fight.
Maybe someone killed him when they stole it.
Wow.
You do know how we think.
You ever heard of these?
Uh, chasteberry.
Sure.
If I were taking them, what would that say about me?
That you had tender breasts, irritability, possible bloating.
Uh, is that possible side effects of steroids?
No, of being a woman.
Oh.
So it's like an herbal birth control to keep you chaste?
It's the opposite.
It's to help you get pregnant.
Oh, are you thinking about starting a family?
Someday.
No, this is wife trouble.
My dead guy.
Ah.
How's that going?
Slowly.
He was a divorce attorney.
'Cause no one wants to kill them.
How's Jeff doing?
He's fine.
He's a little spooked about coming home to an empty house.
But he'll get over it.
He always does.
Are you sure he was crying wolf?
- Are you trying to scare me too?
- Yeah, a little.
Found a pair of boot prints near one of your windows.
It...
This was on Tuesday?
- Yeah, Tuesday.
- Tuesday.
Tuesday is when the bug guy comes and sprays the entire perimeter of my house.
And trust me, I know how bad guys operate.
And I haven't noticed any unusual activity in the neighborhood.
And Jeff does have a history of crying wolf.
He called me three times last week.
All right, you know what?
If Jeff is spooked about going back to an empty house... why doesn't he come to the station after school, hang out?
I don't want him hanging out after school.
Oh, yeah. 'Cause a kid can get in so much trouble at a police station!
You know what I mean.
Okay.
Fine.
Just make sure he finishes his homework.
Absolutely.
No question.
Right.
Daniel.
Find our victim's bike?
Sort of.
I found Craig Daniels, Slater's trainer and bike mechanic.
At least according to Florida Law Journal.
Sounds like he's the friend Slater fought with the night of the murder.
And hold it.
Breathe.
Nice.
Craig Daniels?
Jim Longworth.
Later, jerk.
Can't you see I'm at work?
Well, no, I can see you're actually putting this poor lady through unnecessary rigor... just so you can stare at her ass.
See?
I'm working too.
Take five, babe.
And you hydrate.
- What the hell do you want?
- Well, for starters, Popeye... you can take your tone down a notch.
Pretty smart mouth for a guy I could snap in two.
Did you bring backup?
No.
Just me.
What the hell do you want?
I understand you and your boss were involved in a fight at Cancun's Beach Club.
Wasn't a fight.
You do know he was murdered, right?
I didn't hear from him, so...
I figured something was wrong.
But he's not my boss.
I train him.
Yeah.
You also take care of his bike.
"Take care of"?
I rebuilt that thing from scratch.
That bike is a museum piece thanks to me.
Whew.
Then you must be pretty pissed off... when he gets the covers and all the accolades.
Your name?
Barely mentioned once.
His money, his bike.
Yeah.
Your talent, your hard work.
Everyone I talked to about him says he's a real dick.
Well, they didn't know him like I did.
See, we grew up two houses apart in Astatula.
We were like brothers.
Well, what did you two brothers fight over the night he was murdered?
He was drinking too much.
I told him to stop, and he wouldn't.
So you weren't exactly brothers, were you?
I mean, you cleaned up his messes, polished his bike.
He was your meal ticket.
He was my partner.
I train a lot of rich trophy wives.
If I found one that was a little unhappy in her marriage...
I'd churn her a little bit.
- I fed the business to Allan.
- Messing around with people's marriages... your idea of sport, sport?
You know what they say.
All's fair.
Why shouldn't my buddy make some cash?
Oh, I don't know. 'Cause sometimes maybe innocent children are involved?
And I want to open my own gym.
And Allan was gonna cosign on a loan.
So you tell me, smart guy...
Why would I kill him?
I don't know.
Oh, hey.
Maybe the half million dollars you'd get if you sold his bike... an Eddie Trotta that's missing.
"
- Baby"?
- You think I killed my friend over Baby?
Baby?
Yeah.
That's what he called his bike.
Excuse me for a second.
Daniel, you know the password we were looking for?
Try B-A-B-Y.
We were able to crack his notebook, and we found Wade Conners.
He owned four Harley dealerships in Florida before the divorce.
That the guy who threatened to kill your divorce attorney?
Thanks to Allan Slater, he lost his business, his home, his family... ended up bankrupt and in rehab, all thanks to our dead divorce attorney.
- Hmm.
- He also has a history of violence.
- His ex-wife filed a restraining order on him.
- So where's Wade now?
Fixing Sea-Doos in Orlando.
So I call the dealership.
- He hasn't turned up for a couple of days.
- Nice.
I got a couple of plainclothes F.D.L.E. guys down at Cancun's... making sure that no one there is protecting the guy... or that Wade's not stupid enough to return.
- Where are you going?
- To warn Wade Conners's ex-wife.
Killer Bronco.
Jim Longworth, F.D.L.E.
- I'm guessing you're not Wade Conners.
- Uh, Shane.
Wade's my dad.
I'm looking for your dad.
Is he here?
No, he's not allowed to come here.
Why not?
Came by last week when I was at school, drunk off his ass.
Got in a fight with my mom.
Broke a window.
Wow.
Makes sense.
If I'd lost this place to a divorce, I'd be pretty pissed off too.
Uh, you have any idea when I can find him?
Don't know, don't care.
Is your mom around?
She's with her boyfriend.
You know?
Where that is is anybody's guess, huh?
You know, I used to have one of these in college.
Mine was a straight six.
What's this?
- 302.
- Oh.
V-8.
This baby yours?
Yeah, I got it for being good.
What, like a bribe?
What for?
For allowing my soon-to-be step-dad to move us to L.A... as soon as the school year's over.
And you're not happy about that?
Well, it is L.A.
Look, I'm sorry, but my dad's not here.
I gotta go clean up.
- You know, do my homework.
- Sure.
Hey, I need to get a hold of your mom.
Do you have her number?
Yeah.
Uh, 561...
I got no bars.
I hate my carrier.
Can I use your phone?
- Yeah.
My mom's number's in there.
- Cool.
Thanks.
Won't be a second.
Yeah?
- Hey, where are you?
I got your 20 bucks.
- Who's this?
It's Jim.
You loaned me 20 bucks.
I want to pay you back.
All right.
All right.
- Yeah, you at Cancun's?
- Yeah.
Our guy's at Cancun's.
It's pretty crowded in here.
Raise your hand so I can see you.
All right.
He's the guy with his hand in the air.
We got him.
What are...
What are you guys doing?
Hey, thanks.
I left a message.
Yeah.
Hey, be good.
Oh, my gosh.
There really are 3,000 guys with neck tats.
Yeah, and that's just in the state of Florida.
Are you gonna be all right here?
I need to go see a guy.
It's a police station.
What could happen?
Hey, keep looking.
Let me know if you find your guy, all right?
Okay.
Hey, Wade!
I feel like I got an ax stuck in my head.
That how you got your scar?
I don't recall.
Or maybe when you busted a window on that really nice house you used to have.
You know?
The one that Slater hijacked... along with your Harley franchises, your home, your family.
I didn't kill him, okay?
I got a witness saying that they heard you planned to.
Come on, admit it.
You went to Cancun's to get him back, didn't you?
I went there to get my life back.
To get my son's respect back.
You know what it's like to fail your kid?
Not really.
You want to tell me?
I went away to rehab.
Anger management.
When I got back...
I had to work three jobs just to pay back the lawyers.
Barely even saw Shane.
He thought I didn't care anymore.
What was your plan?
Shane and I always talked about this invention I had in my head.
He called it the Super Muffler.
Cuts emissions, improves mileage.
So...
I sold my truck.
Made a prototype.
Came down here to see if I could get some investors.
But I never got the chance.
Stopped off for lunch and saw that bald, shiny head in the crowd.
I always said if I ever saw that bastard outside a courtroom, I would...
So you followed him.
I had a drink to steady my nerves...
which I hadn't done in months.
And I ran my mouth, trying to work myself up to it.
But then I got too drunk.
Passed out in my van.
Great alibi, Wade.
Way to win your son's respect back.
You talk to Shane?
Is he okay?
Yeah, I did.
He's a great kid.
No thanks to you.
Are you crazy?
Ray, he's seven.
Come on.
He'll be fine.
We're justgoing to the end of the block and back, right?
- Yeah.
- All right.
You ready?
- Yeah!
- All right.
Ray.
Ray!
Honey.
He can do this, all right?
I got him.
- All right.
Come on.
- Be so careful.
So you're watching that again, huh?
You know this Sorento has literally, like, hundreds of stations... and a satellite radio?
Or the MP3 jack.
You can listen to whatever you want.
Or we could talk.
Jeff, you don't need to start that again.
We're almost home.
- You lied to me.
- What are you talking about?
You lied to me.
You said that Dad was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
That he made a stupid mistake.
He made a lot of stupid mistakes, didn't he?
Look, I saw Dad's arrest report at the police station, okay?
- Jim showed you?
- Don't blame Jim!
Mom, don't blame anybody!
Just blame yourself!
You're the one who's been lying to me!
Honey, I was trying to protect you.
- You don't need to know about all of that.
- All of what?
That Dad's done so many stupid things in his life that he may never get out?
- He's going to get out.
- Why should I believe you?
- You're just a liar.
- Jeff, come back here.
You still don't have the time of death?
What the hell's taking so long?
It's tricky.
I can't use liver temp or digestion because he hadn't eaten.
Which leaves me with livor mortis and a potassium eye test.
- So we're waiting on lab results.
- What difference does it make?
- I heard you caught the guy.
- Yeah.
The ex-husband.
He's got motive out the ying-yang, but I'm light on facts.
I got him on public intox, but that's only 'cause he's too broke to make bail.
I've been running profiles on potential murder weapons... based on the depth and angle of the victim's stab wounds.
The wounds are cleaved but very shallow... so it could be a small pocketknife or a specialty kitchen tool.
- So the main form of death still stabbing?
- I can't tell conclusively... till I nail the time of death, and I can't confirm that until...
Till you get the lab results.
All right.
Thanks.
So, what do we do now?
What we should have done hours ago... get a beer.
Sorry I'm late.
Line for the men's room is murder.
- So to speak.
- Right.
Good one.
- Which is why if I had to go, I'd come back here.
- Me too.
- Bring your blood kit?
- Yeah.
- Oh, you mean...
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey!
Hey, guys!
Over here!
- Hi.
- Come on up.
We're doing shooters.
Oh, sorry.
We're on a bit of a tear here.
Ohh!
That's no fun.
Oh, you have no idea.
That's a good bird's-eye view from up there.
You get the surveillance tape on the patrons from the bar up there?
Da...
Daniel?
- Hey.
- What?
Oh.
Uh, no.
No.
- Not-Not here at the Iguana Café.
- Not there?
Not there.
Um, I focused on places the victim had been... based on the bar stamps on his hand.
- But I will get them for you as soon as I am done here.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
Tox screens and lab results.
About time.
Cause of death.
Uh, maybe not.
Tox screens found crystallized tubules in his kidneys.
- Meaning what?
- Meaning he was poisoned with antifreeze.
Stabbed and poisoned?
That's weird.
You know what else is weird?
Slater had a vasectomy.
- So?
- So, he was taking steroid shots... to prove to the world how big his cojones are.
I mean, even for an attorney, that's a pretty big conflict of interest, right?
- Don't get me started on them.
- Thanks to a Dateline clip on YouTube... everyone knows if you're gonna poison someone, antifreeze is the way to go.
- How would you mask the taste?
- It's actually pretty easy because it's so sweet.
Its active ingredient is ethylene glycol.
It's a toxic form of alcohol.
- What about the color?
- Yeah, you could mix it with Mountain Dew or a Red Bull.
- Or RevitalAde.
- Oh.
Regarding the surveillance video...
I've run through the entire day of the murder... and no sign of Slater or his buddy Craig Daniels.
Whoa.
Freeze it.
Enlarge it.
Go back.
Go back.
Back, back, back, back.
There.
Well, if it isn't Mrs. Allan Slater.
Who said she'd never be caught dead on the boardwalk.
What happened to the butterfly tattoo?
Excuse me?
Is there something I can do for you, Detective?
We got a break in your husband's case.
Turns out he was poisoned.
- Poisoned?
You sure?
- Positive.
Good choice.
Ripe.
Good news is is that a poisoner fits a very narrow profile.
Someone who's close to him.
Someone who couldn't confront him... but was very intimate with his habits.
You know, what he liked to eat or... drink.
Sound like anyone you know?
Okay, so I like RevitalAde.
Ooh.
Forgot the best part.
Picture of you...
looking very unlike you.
That kind of inspired us to look at surveillance on the day that your husband was murdered.
Looks like you could be caught dead at Cancun's after all.
Hmm?
You thought that just by putting on a hoochie skirt and a $10 henna tattoo... that you could undo eight years of neglect and roided-out abuse?
I wanted him to see that I have a carefree beach bunny side too.
Probably hard to feel all beach bunny-ish... with that biological clock ticking in your ears.
Found it on your kitchen counter.
Alongside the folic acid selenium.
Herbal fertility supplements.
I take them for P.M.S.
Or to get pregnant, which is what it's starting to sound like to me.
You're the fourth Mrs. Allan Slater.
You saw the prenuptial writing on the wall... so you came up with a plan "B," as in "baby."
That way Allan would have to pay child support, not to mention the house, the Land Rover.
If I wanted to have his baby, why would I kill him?
Because you found out he got snipped...
as in the vasectomy.
And that really pissed you off.
Okay, I went there to confront him.
But that's all.
For all of our fighting, we had great makeup sex.
I saw him drinking, having a good time.
He never drinks.
A high-powered lawyer that doesn't drink?
His body was his temple...
or so he thought.
He never put anything into his body that his trainer Craig didn't provide.
We're not open yet.
So, you got the loan after all.
That's weird, 'cause I found your application in the trash folder of Allan's computer.
How the hell did you find this place?
I'm good.
Well, that, and an office intern made some calls.
Found out that despite you being turned down for a loan... you recently signed a lease on this place.
You come into some cash?
- I got nothing more to say to you.
- No, I bet you do, actually.
Well, your bro Allan was just murdered, so we know the money didn't come from him.
Do I smell something?
Like gas maybe.
- Hey, stay away from there.
- Yeah, yeah, definitely gas.
Hey.
Unless you got a warrant, you're about to lose your arm.
Actually, don't need a warrant, sport.
Not for a public health violation.
- Oh, Baby!
- Hmm.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sure he had his reasons for not cosigning on the loan.
Yeah, he was an ass-wipe.
All you were to him was a lackey from Astatula... who reminded him of how far he'd come.
And, hey, why be rich if you can't rub it in someone's face?
- That what you guys were fighting about that night?
- I told you he was drinking.
Which he'd only do with your permission.
Our lab found high levels of alcohol in his blood.
Not the kind that you get from a bar, but, uh, ethyl glycol.
The kind you get at Pep Boys.
Which give you the same woozy effects as if you've been drinking.
So you guys, uh, had one last workout.
You got pumped for a sun-and-surf day at Cancun's... and you poisoned him with antifreeze... which pairs really well with RevitalAde.
If we test this for trace ethylene glycol... with your prints all over it, we got you for murder.
Yeah?
Forget poisoning.
That's not the cause of death.
Ah, man.
Sorry.
Not murder.
Thanks.
But attempted murder.
And this time I did bring backup.
All right, let's go.
- Tension pneumothorax?
- Yeah.
One of the stab wounds nicked his lung cavity, causing a small leak.
It took me a while to find it.
He basically suffocated.
Before the antifreeze killed him?
Yep.
We also swept the alley.
Found both Slater and Wade Conners's blood.
- He must have stabbed him there.
- You run the D.N.A.?
Not yet.
Wade's AB-negative.
It's a rare type.
- Only one percent of the population.
- I don't know.
Yeah, no, it's rare.
I'm telling you.
No, no, no.
I mean, I don't totally buy Wade's guilt.
What's not to buy?
You said he had motive, right?
I believe your legal term was "out the ying-yang"?
Yeah.
And I found this.
- Super Muffler?
- Yeah.
He invented it.
He was bringing it down here to find investors.
I mean, this guy had a plan.
He was trying to make a fresh start.
Just because it's an old wound doesn't mean it's healed.
Hey.
Can I talk to you?
Sure.
Mug shots?
That's what you thought would ease Jeff's mind?
I just thought if Jeff felt more in control of his situation...
Jim, he saw his dad's arrest and conviction report.
What?
No, no, no.
That's impossible.
- I specifically blocked him from that.
- Oh, my God.
He's 13!
He's found more ways around parental control than I can come up with.
And, no, you know what?
Before you apologize, I want you to hear me.
My son's heart is broken, and he's pissed off at me... for lying to him for all these years, and I don't blame him.
All right.
I'm sorry.
I mean, you're right.
You're absolutely right.
- Look, that's not what I meant to happen.
- Please...
I know you're only trying to help, but please stop fanning Jeff's insecurities... by looking for some phantom Peeping Tom.
Sorry.
Oh, no, I meant, sorry, you're still not off the hook.
I didn't poison him.
That was Craig.
And I heard you have the killer in custody.
A suspect, yeah.
Who threatened my husband all day.
Well, that's because your husband was a divorce attorney... who made his fortune out of destroying people's lives.
You know, like the guy we got in custody.
A fortune that's now entirely yours.
Huh.
I told you we have a prenup.
Death trumps prenup.
You know that.
Unless old Allan was planning on giving it all to charity.
Mm, yeah.
I really didn't think so.
- I gave up my career to be Mrs. Allan Slater.
- Yeah.
And then when you realized that you couldn't, that all you had left... was the bluster and emotional abuse of a man who was never gonna change, you thought...
"Man, why won't the prick just die?
Then it can all be mine... the money, the firm, the baby," so to speak.
Fine.
But you needn't bother telling me not to leave town.
- I know...
- You know how we think.
Yeah, got it.
Why's Daniel looking at a federal database for violent crimes?
'Cause Callie made me promise that I wouldn't.
You know, I've never been married.
But from what I've seen, divorce can be pure hell.
You got scumbag lawyers that are keeping the meter running... pushing dates, filing motions, keeping those wounds nice and fresh.
In the end, gets to the point where that person you loved, you hate so much... you'll give anything and everything just to get away from them... your business, your house, your money.
But there is one thing that you'll fight to the death for... your son.
No way a guy like you lets your ex-wife take your son interstate... unless a ruthless divorce attorney makes it so you don't have a choice.
So you used your whole life's savings fighting for Shane...
- and just like that...
- Slater just steals your son.
So... you killed him.
I can't confess to something I didn't do.
You spent the whole day threatening to kill him, then at 6:00 someone finds his body.
No one can vouch for where you were after 5:00.
And we also got your blood type in the alley where he got stabbed.
Then we got your blood type on his clothes.
My blood ty...
As in D.N.A.?
Well, kind of.
But enough to get a court order so we can test and determine a D.N.A. profile.
When we get that, we can prove with 99% accuracy... who followed him into the alley and who killed Allan Slater.
You don't have to do the test.
I can't take this anymore.
Hey.
Nice work on the confession.
Uh, hello?
I said nice job.
You know, everyone's always so down on television.
But it's really helped educate the public on how forensics work.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Excuse me.
Uh...
Uh...
You're welcome.
You got a hot date?
Pimping your ride.
Look, I told you, all right?
My dad's not here.
Oh, yeah.
I know.
He confessed to killing Allan Slater.
He's going away for good this time.
Well, th-that's too bad... for him.
I know you're not half as pissed at your dad as you pretend to be.
That's why you specifically asked for the old truck.
Because when you were little, he had one.
Whew.
How'd you get that bump on your head?
What, did you get in a fight?
Just being stupid.
Down at Cancun's, maybe?
See, we found blood there that we matched to your dad's type.
But when I explained to him that we could test it... find out who really killed Allan Slater, he confessed... before we could test for D.N.A.
Because it was your blood, wasn't it, Shane?
So you wanna tell me what really happened?
Or are you good with your dad going away forever?
That son of a bitch.
It wasn't enough he had to ruin my dad's life.
No, no, he had to keep us apart too.
My dad saw that bastard go into Cancun's and... he called me up, and he said that... that he was gonna fix his sorry ass for good.
He'd been drinking, so I called him all day, over and over... but he wouldn't answer, and I thought he might do something stupid.
- So you drove over there?
- I saw that bastard go into the alley to take a leak.
Then I warned him about my dad, but he wouldn't listen.
He just kept laughing at me and-and saying that... talking to him broke the custody agreement... that he was gonna have my dad arrested.
I got mad.
You know...
I-I shoved that son of a bitch.
Then his face got all red and he pinned me up against the wall.
He said he was gonna kick my skinny ass.
- You were scared for your life.
- I couldn't breathe.
I-I just wanted him to let go of me.
Look, this is all my fault.
All right?
My-My dad can't go to jail for this.
No.
It's not entirely your fault.
I mean, Slater attacked you.
He threatened your life.
You did what anyone would do.
You defended yourself.
Look, no promises, son.
But you help us out on this, it'll go a long way... to making a prosecution and a judge see things in a favorable light.
That way, maybe you and your dad can have that second chance.
Starting with this.
The Super Muffler?
- He built it?
- Yeah, he did.
It's a hell of an idea too.
He actually built it.
Daniel, go home.
I'm not paying you enough to stay this late.
Actually, I don't get paid at all.
Really?
Mm.
I think you should see this though.
VICAP got a hit on your tattoo guy.
William Cobb.
He's on parole after serving four years for armed robbery and sexual assault.
His last known address is a trailer park just a few miles up the road.
Daniel, whatever they're not paying you, it's still not enough.
Don't move, or you're dead.
- Drop it.
- You got this all wrong, pal.
- She's my girlfriend.
- Shut up, asshole.
- Dude, chill!
I was just gonna...
- You were just gonna shut up!
Suspect in custody.
Thanks for setting up surveillance on the place.
Hey, do me a favor.
Read him his rights.
I'll check on the occupants, make sure they're safe.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you.

Oh, that was amazing.
Mmm.
Your husband -- he's -- he's one lucky guy.
Mm.
Your wife...
Ah, she's one lucky girl.
I'm thirsty.
Want anything?
Be right back.
Oh.
Mm.
Hey, hey.
W-w-what is it?
What's going on?
Yo, dude.
You all right?
Ohh.
I was in my room doing homework.
Homework?
Really?
With your mom at work?
Okay.
So I was playing "Kinect Sports."
Ah, your secret's safe with me.
So, what, you're doing your homework, and this guy's just looking in your window?
Yeah, he had, like, long hair and some kind of neck tat, like a spider or something.
That's kind of specific.
You seen this guy before?
No.
Hi!
Uh, I'm gonna go with "party I wasn't invited to."
S-sort of.
Uh, Jeff had a little uninvited visitor peeking at him through the window.
Oh.
Why didn't you call me?
'Cause you were at work.
Yeah, but I can leave in an emergency.
Unless this wasn't an emergency.
Mom, no, I'm telling you, I saw the guy!
Okay.
Well, now we got the all clear, you can go on in and finish your homework.
Of course, you don't believe me.
No, I believe that you think you saw something.
But I want you to finish your homework, and say thank you to Jim...
Ohh.
Mm.
Sorry for the false alarm.
Really think he's crying wolf?
Well, he gets like this when he misses his dad.
I was supposed to take him last week, but between school and the job -- sorry.
Sounds tough.
Ah, he'll be fine.
No, I was talking about you.
Mm.
You want to come in and cool off?
Is there beer involved?
And chips and salsa, too, if you play your cards right.
Ohh.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on.
No!
Yeah?
Really?
Well, I'm kind of in the middle of something, so...
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm on it.
Sorry, uh, I got a date with a dead guy.
Blown off for a dead guy.
Rain check on the beer?
We'll see.
If I play my cards right, huh?
Yeah.
Don't you have to go?
Just making sure you get home safe.
I'm like a foot from my door.
Never be too careful.
Right.
Here I go.
Some say I don't play well with others.
I was a damn good Detective in Chicago until a disagreement with my boss encouraged me to pack it up and make a change.
So I put the Windy City in my rearview and headed to the Sunshine State to kick back, play some golf, work on my tan, maybe write the occasional speeding ticket.
Yeah, well...
That didn't work out.
The Glades 1x08 Marriage Is Murder Original Air Date on August 29, 2010
Who's our friend here?
Got a male, 40s.
Somebody swiped his wallet, watch, keys, and judging from his tan line, his wedding ring.
Huh.
Puncture wounds.
A lot of them.
On his neck and chest.
Probably from a screwdriver or ice pick.
Wow.
Someone was really mad at this guy.
I can't imagine anyone being that mad at me.
Oh, yeah?
Try harder.
Nice jacket.
Nice?
It's a John Varvatos.
You're looking at about...
5 grand.
Jeans, boots, leather jacket.
All this season.
What?
My wife likes me styled up.
No blood splatter...
Here or on the wall.
No, the blood pooled inside his jacket.
I'm thinking the attack took place somewhere else.
The victim managed to make it this far before he died.
Did you talk to the motel manager?
Yeah.
He wasn't a guest.
And, uh, he hadn't seen this guy before.
We'll use his prints to get an I.D.
This the couple that found the body?
Yes, sir.
I got this.
Yes, sir.
Hi.
Detective Longworth.
I understand you guys found the body?
I-I did.
Y-yeah.
Did you hear or see anything?
Anyone suspicious?
No.
Not at all.
Oh.
You staying here?
At the motel?
In one of the rooms?
Look, man.
We're not married.
Okay.
I mean, we are...
It's just --
Hey.
None of my business.
Right?
Cool.
So, you think you could leave our names out of the report?
Ah.
That I can't do.
But unless your wife...
Or husband, starts to scour police reports, shouldn't be a problem.
Oh-ho.
That's sweet.
Uh, where were you guys earlier?
Uh, just across the street.
At Cancun's.
Is that where you met?
Yeah.
Two weeks ago.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, thank you.
Oh, and, uh...
Thank you, man.
Did they have anything to offer?
No, they were too busy cheating on their spouses to hear anything.
They met at the bar across the street.
Cheaters?
They met at cheaters?
Cancun Beach Club?
What?
That's what they call it.
"They"?
Whatever.
It's local knowledge.
Yeah, well, maybe our John Doe knew that, as well.
Whoo!
Yeah, the guy was a pig.
He kept grabbing my ass, so the bouncers tossed his ass.
Most people who come to Cancun's come to enjoy the beach.
Do a little people watching, check out each other's rides.
Heard it's also a good place for a little off-the-books hook-up.
Cheaters?
Yeah.
So maybe my guy chose the wrong guy's wife.
Your guy hit on everyone.
He pissed off people left and right.
He even ran off his friend.
They got into an argument, and the guy split.
Uh, you get a name, credit card receipt?
Nope.
Paid cash.
What were they fighting about?
Don't know.
But after he left, there was this other guy who got way too drunk, and he kept saying your victim wouldn't see nightfall.
Did you get a description of that guy?
Kind of scrawny, with, like, a flat-top.
And a scar over...
His right eye.
Don't even think about it, because the answer is no.
"No" what?
You don't have a wife, so I'm saying it for her.
No, you can't have a motorcycle.
Anyone with your attention span has no business riding anything like this.
Hey, I found out the victim was a world-class ass-wipe.
Well, there's plenty of those around.
And a guy with a flat-top and a scar over his right eye was threatening to kill him all afternoon.
Good to know.
Here's my prelim.
In addition to the stab wounds,
I also found needle marks in his hip.
Probably for diabetes, so I'm gonna fire off a tox report.
Excuse me.
I, um, have a wife to go home to.
Mm-hmm.
Listen, the guy's been to a lot of bars around here, so get crackin'.
Oh.
Already got it covered.
Got that surveillance video, Detective.
Hey, Dr. Sanchez.
I already hit a few bars, like you said.
I'll compare these to the three bar stamps on the victim's hand.
Then assemble a video timeline.
Have it for you in -- in a few hours.
Okay.
Good.
Go in there.
Match up these bikes with their owners.
What, just because of the leather jacket?
Our vic's too cleaned up to be a biker.
No, these bikes are too expensive to be owned by real bikers.
But rich, obnoxious ass-wipes that everybody hates?
Now, that shows real promise.
Gone through his entire last few hours.
This tape here gives us the best footage of our victim.
Here he comes.
And he looks pretty wasted.
An old enemy, maybe?
Or just somebody he met on the boardwalk and pissed off royally?
I haven't seen him with anyone I'd say looks even remotely close to a friend.
Looks like he was picking fights with everyone.
Uh, anything else on the scrawny guy with the scar and the flat-top?
Nothing.
But I cross-checked all motorcycles with their owners.
All present and accounted for.
Yeah.
There's something about that leather jacket.
A $2,500 leather jacket doesn't mean he rides.
It just means he's rich.
And obnoxious.
Someone a bunch of people clearly hated enough to want him dead.
A bunch of people.
Mm-hmm.
This isn't "Murder on the Orient Express."
He was just a jackass!
Maybe he pissed off a gang of real bikers.
Real bikers stay clear of nice places like Cancun's.
Hey, I put our vic's prints on the wire.
Now, he's not in the system as a criminal, but I did get something else -- really?
Really?
Do you always have to do that?
I got a hit from the D.A. in Palm Beach.
He did an internship there years ago when he was at the University of Miami Law School.
Was he a prosecutor?
Divorce attorney.
Biggest in the state.
Allan Slater, 51, of Palm Beach, Florida.
A ruthless divorce attorney, someone who made millions out of tearing families apart and destroying people's lives.
I'm thinking half the state of Florida wanted this guy dead.
Mrs. Slater?
Yes?
Jim Longworth.
With the FDLE.
Let me guess.
Something happened to Allan?
How'd you know?
'Cause you're a cop knocking on my front door, and he's a divorce attorney who has a knack for destroying people's lives.
Had a knack.
He's dead.
Cancun's.
That figures.
Nothing good ever comes out of that place.
Not the cheating kind, huh?
Maybe your husband was.
Not that I know of.
Or at least that you'd ever caught him at.
Or maybe you did.
Nope.
My husband was a divorce attorney, Detective.
Cancun's is a place where people go to cut loose, escape from their unhappy marriages.
Maybe he was trawling for business.
Oh, without his wife,
I'm sure he was trawling for something.
Empty-headed beach bunnies, maybe?
I wouldn't be caught dead there.
Interesting choice of words.
You know, I normally get more emotion from victims' wives.
Which means you think I had something to do with his death.
Did you?
No.
Do you need my alibi?
Yeah.
You got one lying around?
I know how this works.
I was a crime reporter for Channel 8 in Miami.
Interviewed a lot of cops.
I know how you think.
Wow.
That actually makes me feel a little uncomfortable.
So, you being the hot, on-air reporter on television -- is that how you first got on your husband's radar?
Allan saw something he wanted, he took it.
Look, just because I'm not sad he's gone, doesn't mean I'm happy about it, either.
We had an arrangement.
Ah.
Prenup, I'm guessing.
A generous one.
Allan was very fair to all of his wives.
I knew what I was getting into.
Allan diabetic?
No.
Testosterone.
He liked to feel invincible.
Who doesn't, right?
Mm.
So, Allan 'roided out.
Geez.
Must have been fun to live with.
Not bad if he's on your side.
Probably made a few enemies along the way.
Any stand out?
Take your pick.
What's in there?
Dirt.
On judges, clients, lawyers, anybody he needed to hurt.
Can I take this?
I don't have the password anyway.
Ho!
Allan did own a bike.
A bike.
Try "his baby."
Bought it for $400,000, spent another $100,000 fixing it up.
500 grand for a bike?
Certainly didn't see it at the crime scene.
Trust me.
Allan would never give up his bike without a fight.
Maybe someone killed him when they stole it.
Wow.
You do know how we think.
You ever heard of these?
Uh, chasteberry.
Sure.
If I were taking them, what would that say about me?
That you had tender breasts, irritability, possible bloating.
Uh, is that possible side effects of steroids?
No.
Of being a woman.
Oh.
So it's like an herbal birth control to keep you chaste?
It's the opposite.
It's to help you get pregnant.
Oh, are you thinking about starting a family?
Someday.
No, this is wife trouble.
For my dead guy.
Ah.
How's that going?
Slowly.
He was a divorce attorney.
'Cause no one wants to kill them.
How's Jeff doing?
He's fine.
He's a little spooked about coming home to an empty house, but he'll get over it.
He always does.
Are you sure he was crying wolf?
Are you trying to scare me, too?
Yeah.
A little.
I found a pair of boot prints near one of your windows.
It -- this was on Tuesday?
Yeah.
Tuesday.
Tuesday.
Tuesday is when the bug guy comes and sprays the entire perimeter of my house.
And trust me --
I know how bad guys operate.
And I haven't noticed any unusual activity in the neighborhood, and Jeff does have a history of crying wolf.
He called me three times last week.
All right.
You know what?
If Jeff is spooked about going back to an empty house, why doesn't he come to the station after school?
Hang out.
I don't want him "hanging out" after school.
Oh, yeah, 'cause a kid can get into so much trouble at a police station.
You know what I mean.
Okay.
Fine.
Just make sure he finishes his homework.
Absolutely.
No question.
Right.
Daniel.
Find our victim's bike?
Sort of.
I found Craig Daniels,
Slater's trainer and bike mechanic.
At least according to Florida Law Journal.
Sounds like he's the friend Slater fought with the night of the murder.
And...
Hold it.
Breathe.
Nice.
Craig Daniels?
Jim Longworth.
Later, jerk.
Can't you see I'm at work?
Well, no, I can see you're actually putting this poor Lady through unnecessary rigor just so you can stare at her ass.
See?
I'm working, too.
Take five, babe.
And you hydrate.
What the hell do you want?
Well, for starters, Popeye, you can take your tone down a notch.
Pretty smart mouth for a guy I could snap in two.
What, did you bring backup?
No.
Just me.
What the hell do you want?
I understand you and your boss were involved in a fight at Cancun's Beach Club.
Wasn't a fight.
You do know he was murdered...
Right?
I didn't hear from him, so...
I figured something was wrong.
But he's not my boss.
I train him.
Yeah.
You also take care of his bike.
"Take care of"?
I rebut that thing from scratch.
That bike is a museum piece thanks to me.
Phew!
Then you must be pretty pissed off when he gets the covers and all the accolades.
Your name?
Barely mentioned once.
His money, his bike.
Yeah.
Your talent, your hard work.
Everyone i talked to about him says he's a real dick.
Well, they didn't know him like I did.
See, we grew up two houses apart in Astatula.
We were like brothers.
Well, what did you two "brothers" fight over the night he was murdered?
He was drinking too much.
I told him to stop, and he wouldn't.
So you weren't exactly "brothers."
Were you?
I mean, you cleaned up his messes, polished his bike.
He was your meal ticket.
He was my partner.
I train a lot of rich trophy wives.
If I found one that was a little unhappy in her marriage,
I'd churn her a little bit.
I fed the business to Allan.
Messing around with people's marriages your idea of sport, sport?
You know what they say -- all's fair.
Why shouldn't my buddy make some cash?
Oh, I don't know, 'cause sometimes maybe innocent children are involved?
And I want to open my own gym.
And Allan was gonna co-sign on a loan.
So you tell me, smart guy, why would I kill him?
I don't know.
Oh, hey.
Maybe the half million dollars you'd get if you sold his bike, an Eddie Trotta that's missing.
"Baby"?
You think I killed my friend over Baby?
Baby?
Yeah.
That's what he called his bike.
Excuse me for a second.
Daniel.
You know that password we were looking for?
Try b-a-b-y.
We were able to crack his notebook, and we found...
Wade Conners.
He owned four Harley dealerships in Florida before the divorce.
That the guy who threatened to kill your divorce attorney?
Thanks to Allan Slater, he lost his business, his home, his family, ended up bankrupt and in rehab, all thanks to our dead divorce attorney.
Mm.
He also has a history of violence.
His ex-wife filed a restraining order on him.
So where's Wade now?
Fixing Sea-Doos in Orlando.
So I call the dealership -- he hasn't turned up for a couple of days.
Nice.
I got a couple of plainclothes FDLE guys down at Cancun's, making sure that no one there is protecting the guy, or that Wade's not stupid enough to return.
Oh, where are you going?
To warn Wade Conners' ex-wife.
Killer Bronco.
Jim Longworth.
FDLE.
I'm guessing you're not Wade Conners.
Uh, Shane.
Wade's my dad.
I'm looking for your dad.
Is he here?
No, he's not allowed to come here.
Why not?
Came by last week when I was at school, drunk off his ass.
Got in a fight with my mom.
Broke the window.
Oh.
Makes sense.
If I'd have lost this place to a divorce,
I'd be pretty pissed off, too.
Uh, you have any idea where I can find him?
Don't know.
Don't care.
Is your mom around?
She's with her boyfriend.
Where that is, is anybody's guess, huh?
You know, I used to have one of these in college.
Mine was a straight-six.
What's this?
302.
Ho.
V8.
This baby yours?
Yeah.
I got it for being good.
What, like a bribe?
What for?
For allowing my soon-to-be stepdad to move us to L.A.
As soon as the school year's over.
And you're not happy about that.
Well, it is L.A.
Look, I'm sorry, but my dad's not here.
You know, I-I got to go clean up you know, do my homework.
Sure.
Hey, I-I need to get ahold of your mom.
Do you have her number?
Yeah.
Uh, 561...
Ah, I got no bars.
I hate my carrier.
Uh, can I use your phone?
Yeah, my mom's number's in there.
Cool.
Thanks.
Won't be a second.
Yeah?
Hey, where are you?
I got your 20 bucks.
Who's this?
Uh, it's Jim.
You loaned me 20 bucks.
I want to pay you back.
All right.
All right.
Yeah, you at Cancun's?
Yeah!
Our guy's at Cancun's.
You know, it's pretty crowded in here.
Raise your hand so I can see you.
All right.
He's the guy with his hand in the air.
We got him.
Ow!
What are you --
What are you guys doing?
!
Hey.
Thanks.
I left a message.
Yeah.
Hey, be good.
Oh, my gosh.
There really are 3,000 guys with neck tats.
Yeah, and that's just in the state of Florida.
Are you gonna be all right here?
I-I need to go see a guy.
It's a police station.
What could happen?
Hey, uh, keep looking.
Let me know if you find your guy, all right?
Okay.
Hey, Wade!
Feel like I got an ax stuck in my head.
That how you got your scar?
I don't recall.
Or maybe when you busted a window on that really nice house you used to have.
You know, the one that Slater hijacked, along with your Harley franchises, your home, your family...
I didn't kill him, okay?
!
I got a witness saying that they heard you planned to.
Come on.
Admit it.
You went to Cancun's to get him back, didn't you?
I went there to get my life back, to get my son's respect back.
You know what it's like to fail your kid?
Not really.
You want to tell me?
I went away to rehab.
Anger management.
When I got back,
I had to work three jobs just to pay back the lawyers.
Barely even saw Shane.
He thought I didn't care anymore.
What was your plan?
Shane and I always talked about this invention I had in my head.
We called it the super muffler.
Cuts emissions, improves mileage.
So I sold my truck.
Made a prototype.
Came down here to see if I could get some investors.
But I never got the chance.
Stopped off for lunch...
And saw that bald, shiny head in the crowd.
I always said, if I ever saw that bastard outside a courtroom,
I would...
So you followed him.
I had a drink...
To steady my nerves, which I hadn't done in months.
And I ran my mouth, trying to work myself up to it.
Then I got too drunk.
Passed out in my van.
Great alibi, Wade.
Way to win your son's respect back.
You talk to Shane?
Is he okay?
Yeah, I did.
He's a great kid.
No thanks to you.
Are you crazy?
Ray, he's 7!
Come on.
He'll be fine.
We're just going to the end of the block and back.
Right?
Yeah.
All right.
You ready?
Yeah!
All right.
Ray.
Ray!
Honey.
He can do this.
All right?
I got it.
All right.
Come on.
Be so careful.
So you watching that again, huh?
You know this Sorento has literally, like, hundreds of stations and a satellite radio?
Or the mp3 jack, you can listen to whatever you want.
Or we could talk.
Jeff, you don't need to start that again.
We're almost home.
You lied to me.
What are you talking about?
You lied to me.
You said that dad was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
That he made a stupid mistake.
He made a lot of stupid mistakes, didn't he?
Look, I saw dad's arrest report at the police station, okay?
Jim showed you?
Don't blame Jim!
Mom, don't blame anybody!
Just blame yourself!
You're the one who's been lying to me!
Honey, I was trying to protect you.
You don't need to know about all of that.
All of what?
That dad's done so many stupid things in his life that he may never get out?
He's going to get out.
Why should I believe you?
You're just a liar.
Jeff, come back here.
You still don't have the time of death?
What the hell's taking so long?
It's tricky.
I can't use liver temp or digestion because he hadn't eaten.
Which leaves me with livor mortis and a potassium eye test.
So we're waiting on lab results.
What difference does it make?
I heard you caught the guy.
Yeah.
The ex-husband.
I mean, he's got motive out the Ying Yang, but I'm light on facts.
I got him on public intox, but, uh, that's only 'cause he's too broke to make bail.
I've been running profiles on potential murder weapons based on the depth and angle of the victim's stab wounds.
The wounds are cleaved but very shallow.
So it could be a small pocket knife or a specialty kitchen tool.
So the main form of death is still stabbing?
I can't tell conclusively till I nail a time of death, and I can't confirm that until -- until you get the lab results.
All right.
Thanks.
So, what do we do now?
What we should have done hours ago -- get a beer.
Sorry I'm late.
Line for the men's room is murder.
So to speak.
Right.
Good one.
Which is why, if I had to go, I'd come back here.
Me too.
Bring your blood kit?
Yeah.
Oh.
You mean -- yeah.
Yeah.
Hey!
Hey, guys!
Over here!
Hi.
Come on up.
We're doing shooters.
Oh.
Sorry.
We're on a bit of a tear here.
Ohh.
That's no fun.
Oh, you have no idea.
That's a good bird's-eye view from up there.
Did you get the surveillance tape on the patrons from the bar up there?
Da-
- Daniel?
Hey.
What?
Oh.
Uh, no.
No.
Not -- not -- not here at the Iguana Café.
Not up there?
Not -- not there.
Um, I-I focused on places the victim had been based on the bar stamps on his hand.
But I will get them for you as soon as I am done...
Here.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Tox screens and lab results.
About time.
Cause of death.
Uh, maybe not.
The tox screens found crystallized tubules in his kidneys.
Meaning what?
Meaning he was poisoned with antifreeze.
Stabbed and poisoned?
That's weird.
You know what else is weird?
Slater had a vasectomy.
So?
So, he was taking steroid shots to prove to the world how big his cajones are.
I mean, even for an attorney, that's a pretty big conflict of interest, right?
Don't get me started on them.
Thanks to a "Dateline" clip on Youtube, everyone knows if you're gonna poison someone, antifreeze is the way to go.
How would you mask the taste?
It's actually pretty easy because it's so sweet.
Its active ingredient is ethylene glycol.
It's a toxic form of alcohol.
What about the color?
Yeah, you can mix it with Mountain Dew or Red Bull.
Or Revitalade.
Oh.
Regarding the surveillance video?
Um, I've run through the entire day of the murder, and no sign of Slater or his buddy Craig Daniels.
Whoa.
Freeze it.
Enlarge it.
Go back.
Go back.
Back, back, back, back.
There.
Well, if it isn't Mrs. Allan Slater...
Who said she'd never be caught dead on the boardwalk.
What happened to the butterfly tattoo?
Excuse me?
Is there something I can do for you, Detective?
We got a break in your husband's case.
Turns out, he was poisoned.
Poisoned.
You sure?
Positive.
Good choice.
Ripe.
Good news is, is that a poisoner fits a very narrow profile -- someone who's close to him, someone who couldn't confront him but was very intimate with his habits -- you know, what he liked to eat or...
Drink.
Sound like anyone you know?
Okay, so I like Revitalade.
Oh, forgot the best part.
A picture of you looking very unlike you.
That kind of inspired us to look at surveillance on the day that your husband was murdered.
Looks like you could be caught dead at Cancun's, after all.
Hmm?
You thought that just by putting on a hootchy skirt and a $10 Henna tattoo that you could undo eight years of neglect and 'roided-out abuse?
I wanted him to see that i have a carefree, beach-bunny side, too.
Probably hard to feel all beach bunny-ish with that biological clock ticking in your ears.
Found it on your kitchen counter...
Alongside the folic acid, selenium.
Herbal fertility supplements.
I take them for PMS.
Or to get pregnant, which is what it's starting to sound like to me.
You're the fourth Mrs. Allan Slater.
You saw the prenuptial writing on the wall, so you came up with a plan "B" -- as in "baby."
That way Allan would have to pay child support, not to mention the house, the Land Rover.
If I wanted to have his baby, why would I kill him?
Because you found out he got snipped -- as in the vasectomy.
And that really pissed you off.
Okay, I went there to confront him.
But that's all.
For all of our fighting, we had great makeup sex.
I saw him drinking, having a good time.
He never drinks.
A high-powered lawyer that doesn't drink?
His body was his temple, or so he thought.
He never put anything into his body that his trainer, Craig, didn't provide.
We're not open yet.
So, you got the loan, after all.
That's weird, 'cause I found your application in the trash folder of Allan's computer.
How the hell did you find this place?
I'm good.
Well, that, and the office intern made some calls.
Found out that despite you being turned down for a loan, you recently signed a lease on this place.
You come into some cash?
I got nothing more to say to you.
Ah, I bet you do, actually.
Well, your bro Allan was just murdered, so we know the money didn't come from him.
Do I smell something?
Like gas, maybe.
Hey, stay away from that.
Yeah, yeah, definitely gas.
Hey.
Hey.
Unless you got a warrant, you're about to lose your arm.
Actually, don't need a warrant, sport.
Not for a public health violation.
Ugh!
Ohh, baby!
Ah.
Hmm.
Oh, yeah!
I'm sure he had his reasons for not co-signing on the loan.
Yeah, he was an ass-wipe.
All you were to him was a lackey from Astatula who reminded him of how far he'd come.
And, hey, why be rich if you can't rub it in someone's face?
That what you guys were fighting about that night?
I told you.
He was drinking.
Which he'd only do with your permission.
Our lab found high levels of alcohol in his blood.
Not the kind that you get from a bar, but ethyl glycol, the kind you get at pep boys.
Which give you the same woozy effects as if you've been drinking.
So you guys, uh, had one last workout.
You got pumped for a sun-and-surf day at Cancun's, and you poisoned him with antifreeze, which pairs really well with Revitalade.
If we test this for trace ethylene glycol, with your prints all over it, we got you for murder.
Yeah.
Forget poisoning.
That's not the cause of death.
Ah, man.
Sorry.
Not murder.
Thanks.
But attempted murder.
And this time, I did bring backup.
All right, let's go.
A tension pneumothorax?
Yeah, one of the stab wounds nicked his lung cavity, causing a small leak.
It took me a while to find it.
He basically suffocated.
Yeah, before the antifreeze killed him?
Yep.
We also swept the alley, found both Slater and Wade Conners' blood.
He must've stabbed him there.
You run the DNA?
Uh, not yet.
Wade's ab negative.
It's a rare type, only 1% of the population.
Yeah, I don't know.
Yeah, no, it's rare.
I'm telling you.
No, no, no, I mean, I don'--
I don't totally buy Wade's guilt.
What's not to buy?
You said he had motive, right?
I believe your legal term was "out the Ying Yang."
Yeah.
Then I found this.
"Super muffler"?
Yeah.
He invented it.
He was bringing it down here to find investors.
I mean, this guy had a plan.
He was -- he was trying to make a fresh start.
Just because it was an old wound doesn't mean it's healed.
Hey.
Can I talk to you?
Sure.
Mugshots?
That's what you thought would ease Jeff's mind?
I just thought if Jeff felt more in control of his situation --
Jim, he saw his dad's arrest and conviction report.
What?
No, no, no.
That's impossible.
I specifically blocked him from that.
Oh, my God.
He's 13!
He's found more ways around parental control than I can come up with.
And, no, you know what?
Before you apologize, I want you to hear me.
My son's heart is broken, and he's pissed off at me for lying to him for all these years, and I don't blame him!
All right, I'm sorry.
I-I mean, you're right.
You're absolutely right.
I...
Look, that's not what I meant to happen.
Please.
I know you're only trying to help.
But, please, stop fanning Jeff's insecurities by looking for some phantom peeping Tom.
Sorry.
Oh, no, I meant, "sorry, you're still not off the hook."
I didn't poison him.
That was Craig.
And I heard you have the killer in custody.
A suspect, yeah.
Who threatened my husband all day.
Well, that's because your husband was a divorce attorney who made his fortune out of destroying people's lives -- you know, like the guy we got in custody.
A fortune that's now entirely yours.
Huh.
I told you, we have a prenup.
Death trumps a prenup.
You know that.
Unless ol' Allan was planning on giving it all to charity.
Yeah, I really didn't think so.
I gave up my career to be Mrs. Allan Slater.
Yeah, and then when you realized that you couldn't, that all you had left was the bluster and emotional abuse of a man that was never gonna change, you thought,
"man, why won't the prick just die?
"Then it could all be mine -- the money, the firm, the 'baby,'" so to speak.
Fine.
But you needn't bother telling me not to leave town.
I know -- you know how we think.
Yeah, got it.
Why is Daniel looking at a Federal database for violent crimes?
'Cause Callie made me promise that i wouldn't.
You know, I've never been married, but from what I've seen, divorce can be pure hell.
You got scumbag lawyers that are keeping the meter running, pushing dates, filing motions, keeping those wounds nice and fresh.
In the end, gets to the point where that person you loved, you hate so much, you'll give anything and everything just to get away from them -- your business, your house, your money.
But there is one thing that you'll fight to the death for -- your son.
No way a guy like you lets your ex-wife take your son interstate...
Unless a ruthless divorce attorney makes it so you don't have a choice.
So you used your whole life savings fighting for Shane, and just like that, Slater just steals your son.
So...
You killed him.
I can't confess to something I didn't do.
You spent the whole day threatening to kill him.
Then at 6:00, someone finds his body, and no one can vouch for where you were after 5:00?
And we also got your blood type in the alley where he got stabbed, and we got your blood type on his clothes.
My blood type?
As in DNA?
Well, kind of, but enough to get a court order so we can test and determine a DNA profile.
When we get that, we can prove with 99% accuracy who followed him into that alley and who killed Allan Slater.
You don't have to do the test.
I can't take this anymore.
Hey.
Nice work on the confession.
Uh, hello?
I said nice job?
You know, everyone's always so down on television.
But it's really helped educate the public on how forensics work.
What the hell are you talking about?
Excuse me.
Uh, uh...
You're welcome.
Got a hot date?
Pimping your ride.
Look, I told you, all right?
My dad's not here.
Oh, yeah, I know.
He confessed to killing Allan Slater.
He's going away for good this time.
Th-that's too bad...
For him.
I know you're not half as pissed at your dad as you pretend to be.
That's why you specifically asked for the old truck.
'Cause when you were little...
He had one.
Hoo.
How'd you get that bump on your head?
What, you get in a fight?
Just being stupid.
Behind Cancun's, maybe?
See, we found blood there that we matched to your dad's type.
But when I explained to him that we could test it, find out who really killed Allan Slater, he confessed before we could test for DNA.
'Cause it was your blood, wasn't it, Shane?
So, you want to tell me what really happened?
Or are you good with your dad going away forever?
That son of a bitch.
It wasn't enough he had to ruin my dad's life.
No, no, he had to keep us apart, too.
My dad saw that bastard go into Cancun's, and...
He called me up, and he said that, uh -- that he was gonna fix that sorry ass for good.
He'd been drinking, so I called him all day, over and over, but he wouldn't answer.
And I thought he might do something stupid.
So you drove over there.
I saw that bastard go into the alley to take a leak.
Then I warned him about my dad, but h-h-he wouldn't listen.
He just kept laughing at me and -- and saying that talking to him broke the custody agreement, that he was gonna have my dad arrested.
I got mad.
You know, I-I-I shoved that son of a bitch.
And his face got all red, and he pinned me up against the wall, said he was gonna kick my skinny ass.
You were scared for your life.
I couldn't breathe.
I-I just wanted him to let go of me.
Look, this is all my fault.
All right?
My -- my -- my dad can't go to jail for this.
No, it's not entirely your fault.
I mean, Slater attacked you.
He threatened your life.
You did what anyone would do.
You defended yourself.
Look, no promises, son.
But you help us out on this, you'll go a long way to making the prosecution and a judge see things in a favorable light.
That way, maybe you and your dad can have that second chance.
Starting with this.
The super muffler?
He built it?
Yeah, he did.
It's a hell of an idea, too.
He actually built it.
Daniel, go home.
Not paying you enough to stay this late.
Actually, I don't get paid at all.
Really?
Hmm.
I think you should see this, though.
Vicap got a hit on your tattoo guy -
- William Cobb.
He's on parole after serving four years for armed robbery and sexual assault.
His last known address is a trailer park just a few miles up the road.
Daniel, whatever they're not paying you, it's still not enough.
Don't move, or you're dead.
Drop it.
You got this all wrong, pal.
She's my girlfriend.
Shut up, asshole.
Dude, chill, I was just gonna -- you were just gonna shut up!
Ugh!
Aah!
Suspect in custody.
Thanks for setting up surveillance on the place.
Hey, uh, do me a favor?
Read him his rights.
I'll check on the occupants, make sure they're safe.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be use against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you.

"Grandpa, where does God stay?
- Up in the sky. "
No.
We go there.
- When do we go there?
"How does God look, grandpa?"
"God doesn't have one form, son. "
So God also exists in that lamp?
- Yes.
"ln that balloon?
- Yes, he's there. "
"ls there in that lighter as well?
- Yes, he is there. "
But I can't see him.
- You can see him when you grow up.
Grandpa.
- What?
- Where is your grandpa?
Your grandpa is also there in that balloon.
- Oh!
. . and bring both my grandpa and God here.
Now sleep.
"Mom, see him.
He blew my balloon here.
You. . "
Grandpa said that God is there in that balloon.
If you stop that noise now we can come to the point.
. . regarding this Panchayat elections.
. .
Mr. Dasharatha Rama Naidu will continue as the president.
You shut up!
In this Panchayat our caste-people. .
. . are the majority.
"Why are you bringing caste into this, idiot?"
Like we supported you all these years. .
. . you will have to support us now.
If anyone contests against him he will be in trouble.
"Hey!
Who will be in trouble, rogue!"
"Show this attitude in looking after your family, lazybones. "
Stop.
Stop.
Stop!
What's this fight here?
Step back.
"Listen, whenever there were elections in our panchayat. . "
. . you elected me as the president unanimously.
Now you want a contest.
If there is a contest. .
. . there will be differences and fights.
To avoid them I have taken a decision.
Why do you mind what that marijuana trader says?
Long live. .
- Panchayat president from Kotagiri.
- Sir.
Hey!
Hey!
There is no other president in your village. .
. . other than this liquor-trader?
- Get lost.
". . and who are you to raise voice, a nobody?"
Let's go.
"Hey, Kotagiri!
If you want to contest and show your strength. . "
. .
I will stand in the contest.
Fight with me if you have guts.
If a guy like you wins without competition. .
. . it's a shame to this village.
"Contest, but if you dare to step into my village for campaigning. . "
. .
I swear on my wife you will be destroyed.
- Hey!
"Cut down that rhetoric and first try to get your wife's vote, idiot. "
Get lost.

"You didn't turn into a goon in spite of being in politics, sir. "
There's a world of difference in today's politics. .
. . and the politics of the past.
But when I came home l found another politician at home.
Take him away.
Take his photo. .
. . and roam around in the village.
Politics is getting worse by day. .
". . only because politicians like you are leaving it, father. "
So you will change the society with knives and bombs?
"Ok, go.
Do as you wish.
Go.
Go I say. "

Why did you drag him into politics?
I lost my son now.
Oh God!

- MLA Loknath!
You saw that?
I admitted him in the party once.
"She looks great. . ""
- Hey, bring an omelet fast. "
"Hey, single egg or double egg?"
"Hey, run!
We will see them later. "
So how is business?
Oh!
"Hey, you! "
You show off your strength on kids and women.
"You can't sport moustache, you coward. "
"Brother, Mr. Subbarao is the rightful and legitimate owner. . "
". . of the building, but since last three years. . "
. . you have been ignoring his lawyers' notice. .
. . to vacate his house and sent a goons like me. .
. . on such a decent man.
What sort of justice is this?
"Listen, the moral of the story is. . "
. . pay up his money or leave the house.
. .
I bought one quarter-bottle liquor and one plate biryani.
"You understood the agenda, Naidu.
What's the need. . "
. . for party's workers to fight among themselves?
Tell me.
I didn't understand something else in the agenda.
Are you that MLA's son or his wife's son?
Right now you don't need to know my family hierarchy. .
. . but what you need to know is if you don't pay up his money. .
. . by tomorrow morning whether you will go to. .
. . heaven or hell.
Don't use your tongue in any way you want.
It might even kill you.
Long live. . -. . the leader of granite lands' representative.
I am proud of you. .
Long live. .
-. . assembly tiger Lokanatham.
Long live. .
- Lokanatham!
"Sir, you think the granite site's problem will be solved. . "
. . after the stay order?
- Ask that question. .
. . to contractor Basi Reddy and the state government.
What gave you confidence to challenge. .
. . government's decision?
Just a few days ago you bro-in-law bought half acre land.
How much did he buy it for?
You can say it.
Everyone knows about it.
6 million rupees.
- You know how much they got for that. .
". . as per the GO?
- 90,000 rupees. "
"Brother, even injustice has a limit. "
When you cross that limit it gets tough for everyone.
You are finding government's fault?
There is no government in our country to find faults.
There's only hooliganism.
Move aside.
Move aside.
"Greetings, sir.
Mr. Basi Reddy invited you for breakfast. "
There's nice breakfast at my home too this morning.
"Ask your Mr. Reddy to come.
- Ok, sir.
- Greetings!"
For breakfast?
Where?
Thrash him.
Thrash him.
"Hey, is there only one solution for every problem?"
Hold your hands back and learn to speak.
"Hey, even if your boss comes to MLA's home. . "
. . he will be thrashed black and blue.
Ask him to pay the right amount for our land.
Or else ask your boss to go to hell.
Get lost.
Stop smoking in front of me at least for my reputation's sake.
They say there's no scientific link between. .
". . cigarette and reputation, father. "
"And also, the reason I picked this habit. . "
. . as you smoked in front of me since childhood.
For heroism.
"Rubbish!
And also, I heard that you fought. . "
. . with someone early in the morning.
What's the matter?
I thrashed him just now.
It already reached you?
If MLA's son thrashes people it will first become SMS news. .
. . before it appears in newspapers.
Don't get involved in such silly fights.
We have got men to do that.
I told you so many times to give up those local cigars.
Both are as harmful.
"Greetings, MLA!
I feels like I am looking at sun. "
"Father, he is Mr. Basi Reddy, the contractor. "
He wanted to meet you.
- No need for introductions.
I know your father from the time he started out in politics.
I don't forget people if you are not in ruling party. .
. . for two terms.
In college your son and my son are great friends.
"Kids, go outside and play caroms. "
"What's the matter, Lokam?"
You are looking at me as if I am a snake.
Congrats for getting temporary stay order on granite sites.
I am left with no other option.
I came here for a compromise.
What's the matter?
He doesn't play caroms.
"He plays different games, Reddy. "
If you come straight to the point time will move forward.
He says there's no scientific link. .
. . between cigarette and reputation.
You brought your son will great love and care.
You are troubling people like me. .
If you don't keep a watchful eye forever it will be difficult.
You are destroying huts and building homes.
If we don't fast for a while the system won't be balanced.
"You were born in the computer age, but you talk. . "
. .
like a naxalite .
Wherever you go there is only one rule you follow.
Snatch whatever you can whenever you get a chance.
Then go and keep doing that.
What are you doing here?
From panchayat board's PA to prime minister's PA. .
. .
I greased every idiot's palm to clear this GO.
And now your father passed a stay order against it.
Even if he tries to be Gandhi he won't get a vote. .
. . till he shows notes.
First remove your leg from my booty and settle that matter.
I will provide as much funding as required.
Senior politician and kid politician. .
. . both of you think about it well and take a good decision.
"Goodbye.
- Reddy, direct that funding towards this settlement. "
We will take care of the votes.
Your son looks very sharp.
This is the age where you lack maturity.
Keep it with yourself.
I am from Mangampeta.
If we don't get leave we branches and we don't get. .
. . braches we cut the roots.
How many more millions do you want to earn?
Will you take it with you after your death?
No one who gets thrashed by the labor prospers.
You will die with cancer.
Die with cancer.
Die with cancer.
Die with cancer.
Durga.
If you want to hit people like him with sandals there are. .
. . thousands of crooks out there.
Will you thrash everyone?
We will at least thrash the one we get.
You already started eating?
I asked you to wait till I bring the holy offering.
"How does it matter when we eat the holy offering, auntie!"
"l will be two rows behind you in heaven, right?"
"Eat slowly, without gulping it once. "
"He was born to gulp.
Rules won't work out, mother. "
I studied hard. I am not a dropout like you.
"Hey, I heard you are still hanging out with college students. . "
. . and overseeing elections.
"l am campaigning for him, daddy. "
"He is Basi Reddy's son, right?
- Yes, sir. "
Great.
Fathers are at each others' throat. .
. . and sons are best of friends.
Befriend some low-class friends as well.
It's good for you.
One wayward guy is enough for this family.
Stop this roaming and think of what to do next.
He's talking about you.
He called you wayward.
"You heard it?
- Greetings, uncle. "
Suddenly your father asked for a job for you. .
. . and I wondered when you joined college.
Dharma.
- Sir.
- Appoint this girl as the manager of our hotel.
"And the present manager, sir?
- Fire him and make him. . "
". . clean utensils at your home, you drunkard. "
"Thank you, uncle.
- Ok, dear.
Savitri, send my dress. "
"O really!
Let's go now.
- Hey, learn to respect your guests. "
"l can't tolerate it.
- O really!
Hey, Chinna!"
My Sumo is yours from today.
Why?
Has it become old for you?
Just kidding.
You look like Venky in the movie 'Laxmi'.
"By the way, thanks. "
"Hey, first of all cut off your links with that college.
- Really!"
If I don't maintain at least these few links. .
. . my family's reputation will take a huge beating.
Take it easy.
It's already lunch time.
Will you end breakfast now?
is sir there at home?
- Which sir?
Junior sir.
- Father is senior sir.
He's junior sir.
And what am I?
Pumpkin?
He's there inside.
Go.
"What's the matter, dear?
You are crying outside home naked?"
Oh no!
Who did it?
Your sister?
- Yes.
I guessed it right then.
is she a woman or Mayawati?
"And what you did, dear?"
I just threw her scooter's keys in the water tank.
"You did such a nice thing?
Why, dear?"
"l don't want to go to the school today, uncle. "
For cricket?
"Hey, idiot, I will beat you up.
Come and wear your pant. "
You should be declaring such matters in public.
You should quietly go to school.
You should come back as soon as the school is over.
"Go and wear the pant, dear.
Go. "
"Hey, Surpanakha!
Come downstairs. "
Stripping a kid is not machismo. .
If you have guts dare to strip me.
"Sorry, brother-in-law. "
I couldn't reach the keys.
That is why I am emptying the tank.
You are dead meat.
You. .
You don't need to waste so much water. .
. . to get the keys in the tank.
Out there people are. .
. . committing murders for a pot of water.
Now see this.
The water is the tank is saved. .
". . and you also got the key, girl. "
"Hey, idiot!
- Get lost. "
You ruined my college dress.
I am going to kill you.
Stop.
Why are you staring at me in that way?
You have got such a firm figure.
"Sorry, girl. I got a bit carried away. "
"O God!
Oh no!
Who will marry me now, idiot?"
I am gong to throw you from here.
"Ok, I will marry you then.
- That's what I fear. "
Leave me.
- You are a college dropout.
You're a rogue.
Come to your sister. I will show you what I can do.
If you tell them about the kiss they will definitely. .
. . get you married to me.
Go and take a bath.
Go.
O God!
He leaked the tyre.
- Great. - l'm getting late now.
Why are you after her as soon as you came?
Alright. I am getting late to the clinic.
Drop them at their school.
Her too.
- What?
At school?
"No, thanks. instead of going with this goon. . "
. .
I will go on auto-rickshaw.
"l will break your teeth, if you talk like that. "
You're the goon in a girl's attire.
- Wow!
I said just one word about her brother and look. .
. . how angry she got angry?
You know what he did upstairs?
Even when I see him it burns me.
Then use some nice lotion.
He will be your husband eventually.
You saw those brother and sister's atrocities?
What happened?
- My condition is like that of. .
. . the crickets' on Australia Tour.
Leave it. I am getting late to clinic. - l knew it.
And there are two little monkeys to his company.
"What have you done?
- You know her, brother-in-law. "
This sari shouldn't have come here.
Tell them not to waste a betel leaf and nut. .
. . by inviting someone who is not going to come.
Have you at least seen what this invitation is for?
I saw it. I didn't throw it even after I saw it.
There's only one remaining relation with that family.
Enough of dramas in our lives till now.
At least now ask them to stop these acts.
Let's go.
- Actually in 1870 Bolsheviks revolted on Java. .
"Hey, your phone is with me, right?"
How are you talking on phone?
I see.
Sorry.
Sorry.
You are showing off?
Drop me as well.
Wait.
Pawan. I have been trying her since so long.
Has Sheela enquired about me about me even once?
She enquired about you.
- What did she say?
She asked the guy who stands at our house everyday. .
. . and looks towards their house. .
Who is that idiot?
O Sheela!
Did you tell her I am writing las exams?
I told her that he asked me to tell that he's writing las exams.
I will hit you.
You don't have any helping nature.
Hello!
Stop there. I need to pick up my friends.
- Friends?
I won't see anyone other than Sheela.
Friends?
The look like belly dancers.
"lf you don't have a fashion sense, keep your mouth shut. "
Bin Laden attacked and Saddam was bombed.
He made a comment and you thrashed me?
"Hey, what are you doing in front of kids!"
"Hey, didn't I tell you not to get smart in front of girls?"
Didn't I tell you not to spit on my face while talking?
I am becoming a joke at every turn.
No one will take me seriously till I commit a couple of rapes.
Hello!
Why are you driving like an old fox?
lncrease some speed in life.
He's driving it like a cart.
Buddy.
"Hey, when should I pick you up?"
Goodbye to your ride and goodbye to your speed.
"Buddy, are they going to college?
- l doubt it. "
So that's the matter.
Her oxygen is in this campus.
Unless she is disgraced here she won't come to my path.
"Listen, go to your sister and call her mother and trouble her. "
I will take care of the rest.
- Mother.
- Mother.
Mummy.
Mummy.
Mummy.
Mummy.
Today we shall go to the zoo with daddy.
"Hey, who's your mummy?
Who's your mummy?"
Go to your school.
What are you doing here. .
. . instead of going to school?
Go.
Go.
"Brother.
Hey, brother. "
"Brother.
Hey, brother. "
"Brother.
Hey, brother. "
"Brother.
Hey, brother. "
Brother.
"During Y2K days, in Vijayawada's summer, brother. . "
"ln Kanuru center, in Mannuru lanes, brother. . "
"This beautiful lady bowled me over. "
"She came into my life and became my wife. "
"And ever since then she made me mad.
- Brother. "
"During Y2K days, in Vijayawada's summer, brother. . "
"ln Kanuru center, in Mannuru lanes, brother. . "
"Brother. .
- ""One day I was going on my bike. . "
". .
I fell down from my bike. "
"She laughed at me I was floored. "
"She enticed me.
She bedazzled me. "
"She completely bowled me over. "
"She said ignore the caste, you are mine. "
Then what happen?
- Tragedy started.
"She made me do all the household chores. "
"She was busy with her make-up. "
"She smeared my face with grease and pushed me away. "
"And she came to college with scent on her dresses. "
"She entices me.
She teases me. "
"l ask her to talk to me and she fights with me. "
"She threw the nuptial thread at me. "
But the tragedy I saw in movies looks different.
The tragedies in movies are different. .
". . and the tragedies in real life are different, buddy. "
"During Y2K days, in Vijayawada's summer, brother. . "
"ln Kanuru center, in Mannuru lanes, brother. . "
Oh!
I am not married.
How do I look?
- Wow!
You look like 'Iron Man' Vallabhai Patel.
What?
He too had a tail like this?
Wait a minute.
I became such a big leader. .
. . and you think I don't know how to drape the panchi.
Now?
"You look like a groom, father. "
Do we need all this?
I feel a bit embarrassed.
"Father, once you became a groom for a shattered family. . "
". . in a low-key marriage.
This is all for you, father. "
For your kind heart.
You must always keep your head high.
What?
She didn't like the groom?
You should've told me that before.
She is upset as if she is forced into the marriage.
Dharma.
"You may go now, priest. "
"Good try, but it went a bit overboard like a Tamil movie. "
"There are a few chords which you should never touch, bro. "
Remember it.
"Granny, you won't see my drawing?"
"Hey, enough of drawing. "
Pack your books.
You are getting late for school.
I am getting late to the hospital.
I have to go now.
Don't come again with tears in eyes. .
. . and trouble me and my kids.
Still I don't understand what I have done wrong.
That's why whenever I bring a mother's love here. .
. .
I am sent back with scolding.
After six months of your husband's death. .
. . you married another man.
I too feel ashamed whenever I see you.
For whom did I get married?
If it was for us you wouldn't have given us a step brother.
"l made a mistake by approving this function, Savitri. "
She says I made a mistake by remarrying.
She says I became gave her a step brother.
I had a child with you as it wouldn't have been right. .
. . on my part to just use you as a provider for this family.
I can't even tell her this.
Had I known that my last child would give us. .
. . so much heartburn I wouldn't have given birth to him.
They brought all the chicks from town and kissing them.
Whose batch is that?
- Very influential batch.
One guy is SP's son.
One guy is Basi Reddy's son.
Another one is MLA's son.
They are changing. .
. .
Vijayawada's culture with their dance and drugs.
"And that guy, is he suffering from asthma?"
"lt looks like that, but there are drugs inside it. "
"You are throwing the party, but you are sitting here alone?"
The floor is on swing.
Come on.
Who is he?
- Third year student.
He wants to join our gang.
- Really?
is our gang that famous?
- His father is Rajya Sabha member.
I don't want to know his father's qualification.
But my flow test's stamina.
You know the syllabus?
To get thrashed for 30 seconds with screaming.
"Buddy. .
- Hey, this is a public place. . "
"Let's not get into all this here.
Hey, listen to me. "
We got a scapegoat after a long time.
No.
Chinna.
Listen to me.
"Ready, shoot. "
Hey!
Hey!
- O God!
Pack up!
Get up.
You are still young enough to drink milk.
You haven't become big enough to come to the bar. .
. . and drink beer with us.
Does everyone in your family think that I am. .
. . some idiot in Vijayawada?
Yesterday your brother with a gang and threatened. .
. . to burn this place and today you came with another gang. .
". . to shatter this place?
Hey, you think I am some idiot?"
You think I am some idiot?
You doubt if the bullet entered your body.
"That will happen in the next round, buddy. "
This is just warm-up.
This place is stinking of pee.
Get it cleaned.
"And yes, what did my brother warn you?"
Who is this heroine introduced. .
. . in a super successful film last year?
- Have it.
Have it.
You wake up in the morning and eat Attulu and parched rice. .
. . and read about that beautiful heroine.
And whenever you feel bored shake your waist a bit. .
. . and roam on the road calling yourself youth president.
"Get lost, you. .
You have been in politics for 30 years. . "
". . but you couldn't even protect your brother's bar, you idiot. "
"What happened, kid brother?
Why are you shouting. . "
. . without telling me what the matter is?
When you get a newspaper instead of reading. .
. . useless news you must read the headlines on front page.
"Brother-in-law, you don't know this, do you?"
MLA's son burned down your brother's bar.
He is getting aggressive as he doesn't know everything. .
. . but he can't do anything even if he knows about it.
You have been blowing the balloon of the same party. .
". . for 30 years, but till now you couldn't even get one ticket. "
And do you really need brokerage after all this?
I am ashamed to tell anyone that I am your brother.
"Brother-in-law Bangaru, will you wash your face. . "
. . or will you maintain it for effect?
"You are making fun of me, idiot?
Ok, keep on doing it. "
One day this comedy character will become serious. .
. . and the lives of serious characters will become a joke.
Just keep watching.
He wants to be a gang leader.
"Hey, you idiot!
Since when are you up to all these things?"
Father.
- Drinking.
Fighting.
"Stop it, father.
- Worthless friends.
Worthless deeds. "
I pay hundreds of thousands of rupees as donation. .
. . and get you admission in college for this?
"Father, stop it. I'm the one who sent men to that bar. "
"Hey, instead of scolding him as a brother. . "
". . you are supporting him. I will kill him.
- Stop, father. "
I am the one who sent Basha to burn down the bar.
You can ask him.
He happened to be there at that time unfortunately.
"That's all.
- l am going. .
- Come on, father. "
Enough of whatever you did.
Now it's up to you if you will study abroad. .
. . or take care of business here.
I need an answer in a week.
If you don't stop doing such idiotic things. .
". .
I will break your hands and legs.
- Come on, father. "
"Father, what's the difference between that guy burning it. . "
. . and me burning it?
- What did you say again?
If you talk without respect again I am going to kill you.
"Come on, father.
- Hey, you leave me. "
He does it after thinking it about it a great deal. .
. . and you do it in the fit of rage.
That's the difference.
Enough of roaming around.
Ask him to take care of. .
. . the accounts in the restaurant from tomorrow onwards.
It will mend his ways.
You could've called me and told me. .
. . before things reached this point.
The elections are nearing.
That's why he is a bit tensed.
Your drink's stink is reaching downstairs.
First go and take bath.
If you bite the hand that feeds you. .
". . it can even strangle you to death, Naidu. "
First you destroyed my political career and now you ruined. .
. . my brother's life.
My anger has hit the ceiling.
This time I will put my entire property at stake.
If you can try to get the party's ticket.
It's better to have such cunning fox. .
". . in enemy's camp rather than in our camp, father. "
You saw in last election how he created troubles for us. .
. . in spite of being by our side.
I am not thinking about that buffoon.
But about the cancer growing in our house.
Watching you and me now Chinna also. .
. . showing interest to enter this field.
Every child born to a politician grows with those dreams.
When they get a couple of cronies around them. .
. . they think of themselves as leaders.
If there will be another leader in this house it should be you.
You are a born leader.
He is not cut out for this.
Greetings to party youth.
Today we have gathered here in this star hotel. .
Cut.
Cut.
Cut.
His mannerisms are like that of a eunuch.
It's alright.
We will get women's votes as they will. .
. . think he is a woman in a man's body.
- Then it's ok.
But your language is quite mellow.
"Let's change it, brother-in-law.
Ready.
Action. "
Greetings to the gathering.
Brothers and sisters. .
"You boys and girls, the future of this party. . "
Will you bang your thigh now?
They sound like a drama's dialogues.
When he moves in that way the focus goes on to the belly.
You idiots!
You find faults in whichever way I speak.
Stop worrying me here and tell me party workers have arrived.
They arrived a long ago.
They are having breakfast. .
. . in the lawn.
- Of course they will eat.
"But we arranged for the meals here, right?"
They will continue having breakfast till lunch time.
You. .
Go and call them.
What we are about to talk about right now is. .
. . we need a great change in our constituency's leadership.
In order to get back our party's lost glory. .
In order to win the election and bring back the party to the rule. .
. . all of us must. .
- Hello!
First serve the meals.
We can get done with the lunch along with listening to you.
"What do you say, Som Babu?"
He is not NTR or Megastar . .
. . that we would hear him without moving our heads.
"You are right, Som Babu.
We shall do the needful. "
"Ok, go ahead.
You continue with it. "
We are all ears.
Actually Balayya's movie is releasing.
We are getting late for the matinee show.
"That's how they talk, brother-in-law. "
Come to the point before the matinee begins.
"Friends, what I am saying right now is that. . "
"Even after doing all this, what has the party done for me?"
"Hit the table slowly, or else the bottles will break. "
If it breaks I will get another one.
You continue.
"Brother-in-law Bangaru, now stop wavering. "
Tell me what we have to do.
- You all must go on a strike. .
. . demanding a seat for my brother-in-law.
"Hey, you!
Do we look like fools?"
Do you think we will trade our conscience for a meal?
What do you think?
- Let it be.
"We are getting late for the matinee, Som Babu. "
Think twice before making a proposal.
For succeed in politics one must either have charisma. .
. . or money in hand.
You have got neither.
Our reception was a waste.
"You wait a minute, brother-in-law.
I will bring them back. "
We won't let them off so easily after spending so much.
"Listen, Som Babu. . "
Hey!
- Brother.
Som Babu.
Stop.
Stop.
Listen to me.
"Don't underestimate, brother-in-law Bangaru. "
There's Bangaram in his name.
He has ordered 30 gold pieces for you all yesterday.
My brother-in-law doesn't even have a family.
"He won't take along his wealth with him after his death, right?"
Brother-in-law just wants to serve people a bit. .
. . before his death.
There is good reception ahead.
"Come on, Som Babu. "
"Hey, it seems they give their guests a good reception. "
"Come, let's see what it is.
- And what about matinee show?"
"We can go to first show.
- Hey, we can watch first show. "
"Hey, come on.
You can watch the first show . "
"Hey, it's been one hour since we came. "
Still we didn't get any booze.
"Shiva, bring four beers.
- Sir, today it is. . "
. .
Gandhi's birth anniversary
- So what?
"Booze is for us, boss.
Not for Gandhi. "
"Today we can't serve booze, sir. lt's hotel's policy, sir. "
"What!
- Hey, I will talk to Gandhi about it. "
You go and bring the beer.
Go.
"Sorry, guys. I am late. "
What's this!
The cake is so big.
That's what I am worried about.
They said if there are personal guests we can't serve liquor.
I will hit you.
Who told you that?
I don't want to repeat it again and again.
Go and bring it.
"Sir, madam is not allowing me. .
- Who is your madam?"
"Excuse me, sir!
What's the problem?"
Can you please control yourself?
- Who are you?
I am the new manager here.
We don't serve liquor today.
You can go to another restaurant.
- Really?
When did you join the restaurant?
- One week.
So you never saw that photo in this one week?
Did you understand now who I am?
"And by the way, you are fired.
You go to some other restaurant. "
"Hey, Chinna, you know what that girl is?
- l don't know. "
But she looks hot.
- She's Basha's daughter.
Go and say sorry to her.
- Really?
I thought you would say she is George Bush's daughter.
She is just Basha's daughter.
If she felt that bad. .
. . you go and tell her sorry.
I have my friends with me.
If I say sorry my image will take a hit.
Okay?
Please.
Pass it here.
Before sitting on the dinner table look around and see. .
. . if you deserve to sit here.
You didn't understand what I said.
Don't serve him food.
Only if he says sorry to that girl will there be food on his plate.
Sorry.
- Stand straight and say sorry in the right way.
Sorry. I misbehaved with you in the restaurant.
You sit down.
Sit down.
You are not this leader's servants. .
. . that you would take orders from here. .
From tomorrow onwards she is your boss.
Now stop your idiotic things and learn to manage the hotel.
Only if you mend your ways will there be a place. .
. . for you in this house.
I don't know if they learn studies or not. .
. . but as soon as they enter college they lose manners.
In this world between a winner and loser. .
. . culture is the only difference.
The one who doesn't have that culture doesn't have anything.
"l want last month's banquet booking details.
- Sure, ma'am. "
Who decided this. .
- Excuse me!
Sorry. I was very rude to you.
This is my real apology.
Shall I start the training from the table?
Please don't do this.
Sorry.
You got scolded because of me.
- No. lt's alright.
"l am used to it.
And also, what did he say wrong?"
He asked me to follow a beautiful girl. .
. . and study business.
Will you come here and walk?
I will follow you.
Please follow you.
"Hey, kids!
Come here.
Here comes your boss. "
Not even one cracker should go waste.
Hold on.
- Give me.
Wait.
First of all go and call all the kids in the street.
Go.
"Okay.
- This is not just a festival, it's a carnival. "
Hey!
Hello!
What's the matter?
There are so many lights around.
Can't you see?
You are shining so bright among al these lights.
"My eyes were a bit dazzled, girl.
- O really!"
To woo a girl everyone from Kalidas . .
". . to the butcher out there, you all talk in the same style. "
"Don't dream of getting my beauty, you'll become Devdas. "
Next month a fair and handsome Telugu guy. .
. . is coming from America to see me.
"Get lost, useless fellow.
- Get lost.
Who will marry you?"
He will suffer all his life.
- Throw a bucketful of water. .
. . on your brother.
He has gone completely mad.
What's this!
Did you bring the whole shop here?
He completely lost his sight today. idiot.
Crackers are very dangerous.
You are too young to burn them.
Learn from this pro how one should burn them. .
You can burn them next year.
Come.
This is atom bomb.
This is Laxmi bomb.
No item bomb.
Dipawali. .
You fooled us and now you are going overboard.
Wait a minute. I will teach you a lesson.
He's dead meat.
"Hey, take away the crackers. "
"The sound of your flute. . "
". . mesmerizes one and all. "
"Your charms make everyone. . "
". . forget the three worlds. "
"You dispel darkness and bring light into our lives. "
"You are the one who grants us boons. "
"On Gopala Krishna's arrival. . "
". . demon Narkasura hid in darkness. "
"Narkasura?
How does he look, mummy?"
"He has large, scary eyes. "
"His hair is disheveled. "
"His is dark in color. "
"He is the demon with long, sharp teeth. "
So there is no one to kill that villain?
- There is one.
"He is the savior of the week. "
"He is omnipotent. "
"Lord Narayana took birth on earth as Lord Krishna. "
"Humans beings, sages, all his devotees. . "
". . welcomed his arrival with great fanfare. . "
". . and prayed for his blessings. "
So Krishna fought with him then?
"Yes, he fought with him. "
But before that he also fought with Satyabhama.
"The lady who gives Krishna a hard time. . "
". . is the one called Satyabhama. "
"She is no less than a laxmi bomb. "
"She curses and abuses like these crackers. "
That's not true.
"Whoever he may be, even if he is Gopala Krishna. . "
". . when a lady looks at him he turns into poet Kalidasa. "
"lf she snubs him he turns into Devdasu . "
Oh!
But was Narkarusa murdered or not?
"After killing Narkasura. . "
". .
Sri Hari took away Satya. "
"After being victorious in the battlefield. . "
". .
He left for heaven after slaying the demon. "
"The victory clarion was blown to the joy of people. "
"The joy of victory was apparent on every face. "
"The sound of your flute. . "
". . mesmerizes one and all. "
"Your charms make everyone. . "
". . forget the three worlds. "
"You dispel darkness and bring light into our lives. "
"You are the one who grants us boons. "
The nominations are there tomorrow and today. .
. . you are asking me to change our candidate?
What is this?
He won't talk till he gets his seat.
Then ask him to be seated right here.
We will change the party office.
You want us to replace the guy who won elections five times. .
. . with him?
Why?
is he Lal Bahadur Shastri?
If he wishes he can contest his village elections?
"Narsi, without shivering keep those suitcases on the table. "
Hey!
What's this!
Some income-tax trouble?
"ln every suitcase there are bundles of 10,000 rupees. . "
. . in 500 denomination.
If you wish you can count.
If you change the seat and take the flight to Goa at night. .
. . by the time Loknath comes to file his nomination. .
. . time will be up.
You can quit politics and with a couple of girls in Filmnagar. .
. . you can shoot films.
"You won't be a secretary for too long anyway, right?"
But where did you get so much money from?
The one who has been in politics for 25 years. .
. . is bound to have that much money.
Did you think he brought it from Basi Reddy?
- Hey!
is it black money?
Can't you see his color?
"And also, no one gave so many notes for a single note. "
You broke all records.
If you throw some money they will even felicitate a donkey.
Selfless workers can't survive in this day and age.
People out there quite selfish.
"Your anger makes no sense, Dharma. "
Selfishness is a human being's real nature.
Selflessness is a mere mask.
is your father in a condition to pick the phone?
It depends on the idiot who calls.
He lost his ticket to a buffoon.
My sympathies are with you.
Keep some of it with you.
You will need it post-elections.
Your father taught you to keep confidence in tact. .
. . even while losing.
- The difference between. .
". . a winner and a loser is the confidence itself, Masi Reddy. "
I will give you some free advice.
Don't let your father go outside till the nominations. .
. . are filed tomorrow.
His planets are not in right position.
Father.
Father.
Hey!
Hey!
Basha.
Dharma.
"Hey!
- Dharma, hold him.
Stop the blood flow. "
We have to send boys to bump off Bangaru.
"Hey, who asked you to go after him?"
This is Basi Reddy's conspiracy.
He knows we would win even if we go independent.
With the help of the nomination he wanted to take. .
". .
Bangaru on his side, so that he can clean up the opposition. "
Then I will kill him.
- Hey!
If any one of you touches. .
. . the knife till the elections are over I will kill you.
You got them?
I killed them.
Before police comes here go to your village.
Father is fine now.
"Mark 1 : 34 degrees horizontal,
Mark 2: 7 mm deep and
"Third mark is close to the liver.
- Thank you, madam. "
Thank you.
The bullet missed the chest.
I think he will be ok.
You did the right thing. .
. . by bringing him here without losing too much blood.
Take care of him.
You idiots!
He was attacked in the middle of the streets. .
. . in broad daylight.
What were you doing?
Eating.
Drinking.
Sleeping.
That's what you do?
Idiots.
I should blame my father first.
He feeds these idiots.
"Hey, all you old foxes can take retirement and go home. "
I know how to take care of my father's security.
What will you take care of?
Who among them looks like his bodyguard. .
. . who works for salary?
Look at their faces once.
They are not roadside goons who follow you. .
. . for liquor and Biryani.
They are idiots who put their lives at stake for him. .
. . who did something for them ages ago.
They ignore their home and guard our homes.
With which program will you compensate for their jobs?
They are not like you idiotic cronies.
- Stop your rubbish!
Enough of raising your voice.
Now lower it.
Lower it.
And why you behaving as if you are his real son?
I am that father's real son.
Either in politics or for succession. .
. .
I stand ahead of you.
You got it?
I am giving you five minutes' time to understand that. .
". . these are just words of aggression, not sensible words. "
Get rid of that itch in your mind.
Or else what will you do?
What will you do?
What will you do?
What will you do?
Tell me.
You haven't seen this brother before.
Listen to me.
This is not some itch that I acquire a few days back.
I got this itch since childhood and now it reached my head.
"lf you have the guts then face me, or else step aside. "
Let's go.
"How are you feeling, father?
- l am back from dead. "
With sympathy wave we will win this election. .
. . as an independent candidate.
Go.
There's something in my mind.
Will you contest in my place this time?
"l am not ready for it, father. "
You sign the nomination papers.
I will take care of the rest of the things.
Long live. .
-. . our leader Bangaru!
Long live. .

What's this?
Instead of taking me to the electoral office. .
. . you brought me to some warehouse?
"Don't worry, brother-in-law.
One minute. "
I think they got over the high.
"Hey, we are getting late for the nomination. "
If required we will buy you liquor again.
Get up.
"lt's time for the nominations.
- Hey, get up!"
You idiots!
Lift that shutter.
The nomination time will be over in another two hours.
Get up.
What's this trouble now?
- Oh no!
Your planets are not in the right position. .
". . for another two hours, Bangaru. "
Before doing such auspicious deeds. .
. . we should take care of all these things.
We can think of your nomination in next elections.
Have a chilled beer and take a drag.
How did he infiltrate into our gang?
- Still you didn't get it?
"This is his gang, brother.
That's why even after. . "
. . 25 years you are still the youth president.
Tell me something.
Why does everyone who contests elections. .
. . holds back his nomination till the last moment?
What would happen if something like this happens. .
. . at the last moment?
Tell me what would happen.
Hey!
Hey!
What's this betrayal!
Drag my cart just once. .
At least give me the honor of filing my nomination.
I will give a helicopter to every village.
"My men are not so greedy, Bangaru.
- Naidu. "
"Yes, Bangaru Naidu. I planned this just as a joke on you. "
So now you have the distinction of spending. .
. . 60 million rupees without getting a nomination.
Assume this is your trophy for this election.
Even if you garland a buffoon and take it around on a chariot. .
". . it still remains a buffoon, but can't become a leader. "
"Get lost, you idiot. . "
You are not as long as a toe and you too fool me?
"Hey, you already settled there?"
What can we do after we got trapped. .
". . in such a major problem, brother-in-law?"
"Hey, distribute cards for brother-in-law too.
- Ok, bro. "
I should first thrash you.
Long live. .
- Loknatham!
Long live. .
- Loknatham!
Long live. .

Long live. .
- Loknatham!
Time is up.
You may leave brother-in-law Bangaru.
Will you finish the game or middle-drop?
- You idiot!
His life turned upside down.
What's that question?
What's that arrogance!
Brother-in-law.
Brother-in-law Bangaru.
"Hey, why have you surrounded us?"
Will you molest him and ask him 1000 rupees for each?
O God!
O God!
Why do you give them ideas. .
. . that they don't get?
ldiot. idiot.
How can we send a man who spent millions of rupees on us. .
. . with so much trust in such a dull fashion?
Start the dance.
"Get lost, you idiot!
You squandered my wealth. . "
. . even without getting a nomination.
He didn't die and you are here to trouble me.
"Hey, till he returns the money seize his rice mills. "
What's this injustice!
If you lose money in horserace. .
. . will you ask the horse to pay you back?
I will definitely ask for it.
And I didn't bet on a horse. .
. . but I bet on a donkey.
On a donkey.
On a donkey.
Are you happy now?
Come in. I was just thinking of paying your father a visit.
Every morning when you see yourself in the mirror. .
. . you must remember how close your were to the death.
From now on you are not Mangapeta Basi Reddy. .
X-mark Basi Reddy.
This is Kadapa's bomb.
This is Mangampeta's granite.
Put this in your mouth and put this somewhere else.
"l'll handle it.
- Greetings, sir.
Greetings.
- Greetings. "
Give it to me.
What's the need for all these things?
How is your health?
Are you fine?
"Sir, the Bheeshma of politics. . "
. . for the stupid thing that the general secretary did. .
. .
I am slapping myself as the party's president.
These are not your hands.
You must join our party back.
Of course you will join it.
You have already joined it.
That's all.
Take our photograph together.
I am pledging it right in front of the media persons. .
. . once the elections are over. .
you'll be back with full fanfare.
"Not just that, but as token advance. . "
. .
I am firing that bafoon Bangaru. .
. . and appointing your son as the youth president.
Wait.
Wait.
- Ok.
Ok.
"Listen, PK. .
- Sir, you please take rest. "
You have no dialogues in this scene.
You don't say anything else.
"Come on, let's go.
Sir needs to take rest. "
We should leave him alone.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Long live. . -. .
Democratic party's youth president Mitra.

You settled his career well.
And what about me?
I asked you to decide that.
I have decided it. I want to be your political heir.
You don't get leadership in inheritance.
It's something you are born with.
Don't whine for something that you don't have. .
. . and lose what you have.
Go and take care of the business.
Or else go abroad and study.
I am not interested in anything except politics.
The more you say 'no' the more I get interested in it.
Then give it a try.
But you won't get my support.
Hey!
Listen to me.
You are not cut out for politics.
"You may not know this, but I am 25 years old. "
Half the age of a person's active life.
I will decide what I am cut out for and I am not.
Chinna.
Chinna.
"Leader is here. "
"Leader is here. "
Leader is here. "
Leader is here. "
Leader is here. "
Leader is here. "
Leader is here. "
Our leader is here. "
Leader is here. "
He is the sun settled in every heart. "
He brought the light into our lives. "
He stood by us in thick and thin. "
He is our protector. "
Leader is here. "
Our leader is here. "
Leader is here. "
He takes on public's enemies. "
He is not afraid of anyone. "
Courage is his middle name. "
Sky bows down to salute him. "
His heart is filled with kindness. "
He won't let any eye be moist. "
He has given us hope. "
He gave us the courage to dream again. "
Leader is here. "
Our leader is here. "
Leader is here. "
We offer prayers for him. "
Our full support is with him. "
May he live for hundred years!"
May God help him prosper!"
This is the new ray of hope. "
This is the beginning of a glorious chapter in history. "
He abandoned his own son and is enthroning. .
". . someone else's son.
Loki, you rogue!"
Just wealth and status is not enough for a person's life. .
. . you also need attention and ambition.
So he is more important to you now.
You idiot.
He grew right in front of our house and threw me out.
In history even those who killed mothers and fathers. .
. . have also become kings.
People always need. .
. . someone to hang on to.
Really!
You take just one step. .
. . and we will take
"Come here once, buddy. "
Hey!
- l want to jump from here.
Will you jump with me?
"Buddy. .
- Come on.
Come on, let's jump. "
Leave him.
- Leave him.
- Shall we jump?
Shall we jump?
- Come fast.
Leave him.
You idiots!
You just drink and eat and live off me.
That's what your life is.
Get lost from here.
"Narayan, throw them out. "
He will call us when he gets over the high.
Come on.
Move aside.
Manager.
"Chinna, why are you becoming like this?"
My mother wanted to kill me when I was in her womb.
Sister treated me like an untouchable.
Without any hesitation father thrashed me. .
. . calling me worthless.
For a person who grew up among these things. .
. . except alcohol and death what other option is left?
Chinna.
Chinna.
Chinna.
Chinna.
"Are you ok?
Chinna, please.
Calm down.
Calm down. "
Are you ok?
Relax.
Relax.
"Chinna, please.
Leave me. "
"Chinna, please don't harm me. "
"Love you, Navya. "
No one showed me so much love till date.
"Try to understand me, Navya.
- No, Chinna. "
"l will marry you, Navya.
Please, Navya.
- No, Chinna. "
Please come near me.
- Try to understand it.
"Try to understand it, Navya. "
Prove your love.
Please.
- Chinna.
"Don't stop me, Navya.
- Chinna. "
"lf you too leave me I won't be able to survive.
- No, Chinna. "
"l love you, Navya. I am not a bad guy.
- Chinna.
Please. "
I am really a good guy.
- Chinna.
"Chinna.
Listen to me, Chinna. "
Chinna.
Leave me.
Please.
"l feel scared to see the sky in darkness, grandpa. "
Even though there are so many stars. .
. . it's the darkness that wins eventually.
Darkness is also a fire that has doused.
A human being too from his birth to his death. .
. . burns like a fire.
"He burns with hunger, he burns with anger. . "
". . with lust, with jealousy, he grows with such burns. "
Some people burn everything that they touch with that fire. .
. . and turn into demons.
And some others use that fire to search the wisdom. .
. . and show the path to the rest of the world.
Hey!
He is up to something again.
Drive faster.
Drive faster.
Drive faster.
Drive faster.
Drive faster.
Drive faster.
Give some water.
Give some water.
Give some water.
Give some water.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Nothing will happen.
Hey!
Hey!
Drive faster.
"Give her the injection.
- Shut up, you idiot!"
"Hey, stop it!
Get rid of her first.
Stop the vehicle. "
Stop the vehicle first.
Stop it.
Buddy. .
- You idiot.
"Hey, you gave her the injection?"
"The dose that you gave her, first-timers won't survive. "
Think of some other plan.
This is what happens if you experiment too much. .
. . with different sort of drugs.
"Hey, no!
This may become a murder case. "
What we did till now is no less than a murder case.
"Chinna, she won't survive anyway. "
If she escapes alive all of us will be arrested. .
". . in drugs' case and rape case, like in Pratyusha case. "
But who went to jail in Pratyusha case?
You don't know anything.
Shut up!
Idiot.
Stop.
- Stop.
Listen. - lf he turns into ash. .
. . we have 50% chance of escaping.
"Chinna, don't listen to him. "
Or else 100% we will turn into ash.
"Chinna, no.
No, Chinna. "
"Hey, no!
- Chinna.
Chinna. "
Move aside.
- Just do it.
- Stop.
"No, Chinna.
- Come on. "
"Chinna, you go and file a missing complaint. . "
. . in the police station and we will manage the waiter.
Let's go.
And people are following you as they see that guiding light.
Now it's up to you if you see your gain in their faith. .
. . or if you understand your responsibility. .
. . and burn like a guiding light.
. . on the outskirts of Vijayawada.
A Tata Sumo was burning at -10 feet from this dead body.
According to the locals this incident must've taken place. .
". . after midnight.
Along with cameraman Ram, it's Shiv. . "
My left profile is a bit fat.
Place cameras on the right.
Whoever is responsible for this atrocity on. .
. . this innocent girl's life will be caught and punished severely.
Our department won't rest in peace till we catch the killer.
The Sumo is registered on our MLA's son's name.
Our MLA?
"Sir, you think this is just a murder or rape and murder?"
"Hey, if a girl is found dead by the roadside with ruffled hair. . "
. . can't you think of anything else. .
. . other than rapes and murders?
It's like reviewing a movie by watching its poster.
Go away.
Go away.
"Sir, there's a problem. I need to meet you urgently. "
What's the matter?
Has something happened to Chinna?
Nothing happened to him.
But we must punish ourselves. .
. . for being his parents.
- Where is Chinna?
Send our men and find out where he is.
I knew he would do something when he challenged me and left.
The body went for post-mortem. .
". . even before we got the lead, sir. "
Or else the matter would've been in our control by now.
Who is the girl?
"The body is sent for post-mortem, sir. "
"lf you have any problem, do not do the post-mortem, madam. "
This is a gutter of a place.
If you don't be insensitive it's hard to work here.
Madam.
Madam. .
- What do you think. .
- What is. .
Can you tell us. .
- Madam.
"My life is in this report, sister. "
It's you?
"Security, please. .
- Sister.
Sister.
Please, sister. "
"Sister.
Sister.
Please.
My life, sister. .
Sister, please. "
"Sister, I swear I didn't do it intentionally. "
I loved Navi a lot.
"lt happened under the influence of alcohol, sister. "
"We tried our best to save her, sister. "
But we couldn't.
"Sister, please.
My life is in your hands, sister. "
"Sister, please. "
"Please write 'drug reaction' in the report, sister. "
"Please save me, sister.
Please, sister. "
"We are born to the same mother, sister. "
Right now it's not our mother who is in front of me.
You sinner.
Are you a human being or an animal?
How could you do such a thing!
How could you!
How could you do such a thing!
Get lost from here.
Get lost.
You devil!
You have been like this ever since we were kids.
You always hated me.
Now that you got a chance you want to destroy me.
"l am your brother after all, you devil. "
Even if you walk the path of justice. .
. . will that girl come back to life?
My misfortune.
There are hundreds of doctors in this city. .
. . but my case came to you.
My misfortune!
My misfortune!
My misfortune!
Hey!
How did I harm you!
Why are you all doing this to me?
Tell me.
"Hey, I will kill you.
- Take him away. "
Hey!
What have you done to my daughter!
What have you done!
I worked for your dad like a dog for 30 years. .
"You are my father's dog, not mine. "
"Hey, Chinna!
Have you gone mad?"
Don't come close to me. I will slash your throats.
Don't come close to me.
Chinna.
Have you gone mad?
What are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?
"Greetings, Naidu! "
Basi 'X-mark' Reddy's second innings have begun.
"Your son raped her alone, but got my son as well. . "
. . trapped in the murder.
"There is an idea to save your son, sir. "
If we choose the less damaging option. .
. . we can divert the case right now without any confusion.
The sumo is registered in Mitra's name.
"Gowda, before I get up go so far away. . "
. . that you don't reach my hand or sandal.
Every time I see the 'X' mark in mirror. .
. .
I think of your elder son.
Till I get even with him. .
. .
I feel ashamed to see myself. .
". . in the mirror, sir. "
"l gave birth to a sinner, but not to his sins. "
In this unfortunate incident I got a double blow.
Both the tormentor and the victim are my kids.
Basha is not just a worker for me.
He is family.
From today onwards I have only one son and successor. .
How come he has such great command over dharma. .
. . even though he didn't even pass tenth standard?
"l think he exercises control on meat and alcohol, bro-in-law. "
"lt's too late for that, brother-in-law.
You carry on. "
He can't have even one meal without meat. .
. . and prefers alcohol to water.
And he wants to know about dharma.
"Move aside.
Move aside.
No.
No.
- Sir, sir, sir. "
"Sir, sir, sir, just one question. "
Just a while ago Mr. Gowda said that the Sumo. .
. . was registered on Mitra's name.
That means you tried to tinker with the evidences. .
. . even before the matter became public?
Even if anyone tries to tinker with the evidences. .
. . truth comes out eventually.
- Move aside.
Move aside.
That's why since the matter has become public anyway. .
. . you are trying to dramatize the issue and win the election.
Am I right?
In our country election is the biggest drama?
People are the greatest actors.
They know the difference between drama and truth.
You can write whatever you wish.
- Move.
Move aside.
Move aside.
Oh no!
I have never seen such an incident. .
. . where one puts one's real son in the jail. .
". . and enthrones the stepson, except in the movies. "
It pains me even when I think of it.
His father is quite busy with the election drama.
He can't help him escape from this case.
Arrange the bail papers.
I will sign them.
"How is Basha?
- l can't see him, father. "
He is not there even in the hospital.
Basha won't leave him alive.
He won't leave him alive.
A man who has been loyal for 40 years. .
. . is after my son's blood after one incident.
"To save Chinna you have to lose Basha, sir. "
Killing is not the only way to save a person.
You mind your work.
"Greetings, sir.
- Where is Chinna?"
"Mr. Basi Reddy took him out on bail yesterday itself, sir. "
Who is he to take him out?
And how could you leave him?
"What's this, sir!
Am I the root case of your family drama?"
He came and signed the papers and he went with him.
Why are you blaming me for this?
- Mitra.
You are MLAs sons.
You can do anything.
You can beat the policemen and you can commit murders.
You have got power in your hands.
"Sorry, uncle. "
Though I am from Kadapa. .
. .
I am not a ruthless man to kill a person for a minor issue.
If you won't accuse me of creating rifts. .
. . tell me after your father passes away who will benefit the most?
He stays in your home.
He made his move right before the nomination was filed.
He would have become an MLA on sympathy wave just like that.
I didn't see such conspirators even in TV serials.
They got a chance and that brother and sister. .
. . have completely ruined your life.
I will do my best to get you out.
But the report your sister has prepared. .
. . is a major hurdle for us.
Even if you escape this case you have got. .
. . nothing is left for you.
When he becomes a leader. .
. . you will keep hailing 'long live brother Mitra'. .
. . 'long live brother Mitra' and be his subordinate all your life.
That's final.
Have a couple of drinks for now. .
. . and have a sound sleep.
Sleep for now.
Sleep for now.
In the forthcoming elections the current district MLA. .
. .
Lokanatham is trailing behind with 12%. .
. . in the recent polls to his nearest rival even though. .
. . his party is leading in the remaining parts of the state.
According to the experts this political warhorse. .
. . will definitely face defeat this winner of four previous elections.
The chief reason seems to be his son's involvement. .
. . in a murder case.
"Sir, phone. . "
"Are you a bit worried, brother?"
You want to know about your younger tiger?
I brought your younger tiger out of the cell. .
. . and kept him in my cage.
It is very disturbed mentally.
"lf l unleash it, it will bite whichever throat it sees. . "
. . including yours.
"Look, Naidu, I always support the ruling party. "
Your party will definitely win this election.
Even now your victory is more beneficial to me than your defeat.
Let's join forces at least now.
With my muscle power and financial power. .
". .
I can change the scenario in no time, I swear on granite. "
"Basha, take out the car. "
Basha.
- Sir. .
It's him.
Come on.
"Hey, stop!"
The silent operation will turn into communal fight.
This dog can't escape.
It can't go out of this area.
Keep your gun inside and move.
"They are throwing 1000 rupees for every vote, sir. "
If we don't throw money we will be in trouble.
It will save at least two weeks' petrol.
- What do you mean?
"We won't survive in politics if we are too righteous, sir. "
"How did we survive till now, Durga?"
"This election is different, sir. "
How many voters are there in our constituency?
"At most 300,000.
- How many of them come to the booth?"
"About 200,000.
- ln the remaining 100,000. . "
". . there will be at least
". . to the booth.
- That's not possible, sir. "
Everything seems like juvenile politics.
Shut up!
If you can't do it shut your mouth and stay at home.
You guys are lazy and stupid.
And think of taking wrong paths.
Such people don't have a place in my camp.
"Don't talk like that, sir. ln last elections. . "
. . even though our party's condition was pathetic. .
". . we helped it win with 100,000 majority. "
"This election is different, sir. "
People have forgotten all the good deeds we have done.
They don't remember anything except what Chinna did.
"lf we lose the elections I will die, sir. "
"l will die, sir. I will die.
- Durga. "
Durga.
Durga!
One should cry not while competing. .
. . but while one is still a human being.
Don't forget that you are also a leader.
Sit down.
Sit down.
"Mitra, some party workers have some questions regarding the posters. "
Go and take care of them.
Leave the campaign of the last two weeks to me.
Go.
Dharma.
Durga.
- Sir.
How many voters are there in your panchayat?
"About 25,000, sir. "
Will this be enough?
"Do we have to fear defeat so much, father?"
Politics is like riding a tiger.
Once we get on it we can't get down.
We can't survive.
As elections are nearing in Gannavaram constituency. .
. . the contest between Lokanatham and. .
. .
Partha Sarathi is intensifying with each passing day.
Experts are unable to predict who is going to win.
There are whispers that Lokanatham. .
. . is also taking some incorrect measures to win this election.
This evening the counting is about to begin all over the state.
The election commissioner said that by tomorrow morning. .
. . the results will be out.
What's the matter?
Has your brother-in-law bought Benz?
I don't know.
- Did you guys pay the dowry late?
Installment Indian.
'l am the path. I am life.
I am the ultimate truth. ' l know you are Benz.
Mercedes Benz.
Even if you are Benz you shouldn't be so arrogant.
You mean other cars are not cars?
Are they bullock-carts?
I am the path. I am the life.
"Buddy, I think there's some religious fanatic inside. "
If we go inside we will be converted.
Let's go and hide in the nearby temple lf you have faith in your faith. .
. . you won't be worried about your conversions.
And what's wrong with you guys?
You look as if. .
. . it's Monday morning and you have to go to school?
Have they also converted?
"Uncle, someone came from America to marry sister. "
What?
- Same old story.
"Sister, with whose permission did you set this match?"
Have you forgotten that I am there for her?
Oh!
They can hear you.
I too want him to leave.
- So nice.
God made you very beautiful.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
- What's wrong with him?
I thought he doesn't belong to our religion. .
. . but he doesn't even look like us.
Oh!
His father is from Andhra and mother is an American.
Your brother-in-law wants to send her away to America. .
. . no matter however her in-laws are.
They will definitely be united in the climax.
Here is the fruit cake.
"Hey, go and play.
You can play this game. "
Will she like him?
- You know it's enough for our girls. .
. . if the guy is fair.
They fall for fair guys in a second.
Move aside.
- You move aside.
"Hey, don't misbehave here. "
You put your hand around me?
- Hello!
"John doesn't mind such things.
Right, John?"
Right. I am full of love.
You liked the white guy a lot?
- l told you about him.
"He's my cousin.
- Hey, nice to meet you, man. "
My name is John Meyer.
God bless you.
I am a white skinned Telugu guy.
Ya.
Ya.
Ya. I am Mitra.
I am from Bejawada.
He is into hooliganism.
- Ya. I heard yours is a tough job.
Very tough.
Without missing the deadline. .
". . we have to oversee a fight a day, a murder per a week. . "
". . and a rape every month, or else we'll be considered weak. "
Then you must come to Lord's home once. .
. . and hear his message.
- Ok.
Ok.
Definitely.
But right now I have to go to Superstar's movie. .
The kids are a bit dull.
What have you done?
You avoided him ruthlessly.
He hasn't done anything wrong.
He only fault was that he fell for you and became a scapegoat.
"Uncle, you are in trouble now.
- What?"
You said 'l love you' to her first.
You've lost to her.
'And now there will be a song. '
"For the longest time. . "
". .
I have been like this. "
"Today all of a sudden. . "
". .
I have become like you. "
"l will be your shadow. "
"l will be in your heart. "
"You have changed me so much. "
"You have had such an effect on me. "
"You are unwavering. "
"You have settled deep down in my heart. "
"For the longest time. . "
". .
I have been like this. "
"Today all of a sudden. . "
". .
I have become like you. "
"l heard about your dreams in my heart. "
"l have seen your magic. "
"You make my heart skip a beat. "
"How do I get over this restlessness?"
"Even for a second. . "
"l don't feel like staying away from you. "
"There is not a second. . "
". . when you are not in my mind. "
"For the longest time. . "
". .
I have been like this. "
"Today all of a sudden. . "
". .
I have become like you. "
"For the longest time. . "
I bore it even if they doubted me.
I bore it even if they insulted me.
The love of my life. .
I escaped from police. .
Mitra.
- Uncle.
- Mitra.
- Buddy.
Mitra.
Mitra.
Where are you?
You wait outside.
- Ok.
"Nikki, come fast. "
"Hello, brother-in-law!"
What do you want?
- l was missing sister a bit.
So I felt like dropping by.
It's the Sunday evening.
You sent everyone out. .
". . to spend quality time with your wife?
- Hey, get out now. "
"l said get out of here.
Get lost, you idiot. "
It will be fine.
Calm down.
Lift it.
Lift the phone.
"What's this, brother-in-law, you too treat me in this way?"
"l know I am step-in-law, but still. . "
. . you shouldn't be talking like that.
"You're psychiatrist, right?
You should treat me like a patient. "
Okay?
Hello!
Sister.
Sister.
Sister.
Sister.
What?
You escaped alive?
- Chinna.
Sister.
Mitra.
Mitra.
Chinna.
- Then listen to me.
In another five minutes I will kill your sister. .
. . and if your brother-in-law interferes I will kill him as well.
Without a miss.
"Chinna, don't harm sister.
- Hey!
Hey!
Chinna. "
"Ever since childhood there's a thorn in my heart, brother-in-law. "
It grew with age and it infected my character.
Actually I left home for its treatment.
"Brother-in-law, you haven't grown up in 'action' settings. "
Give it to me.
Give me the bat.
"l will train you.
Give me, brother-in-law. "
Give me.
Leave it.
"Chinna, what are you doing there?"
Hey!
What are you doing!
"Chinna, don't harm sister.
Hey!"
We are born to the same mother.
- O really!
That's what irritates me too.
So till I kill both of you I can't live in peace.
You thought by getting me trapped. .
. . you could enthrone your brother?
- Hey!
Stop your atrocities at least now.
Let my husband live at least for my kids.
"Chinna, please.
No. "
Your character doesn't change even if you kill one person. .
. . and even if kill hundred persons.
This is my character for this birth.
Human history became with fight between brothers.
"For centuries weapons have changed, but the wars didn't. "
Chinna.
He is not my brother.
Get lost.
It can't happen.
"Hey, look at them. "
No!
- Uncle.
There will definitely be recounting this time.
They are not letting our agent inside.
You must talk to the collector once.
Where is Mitra?
- l am calling him since long. .
. . but not getting through.
- All of you look like. .
. . you are busy with vote-counting.
"l don't think there is enough time to know the result, father. "
"Mitra was attacked, sir. "
"We don't know who they are, but Mitra escaped. "
Where did it happen?
- ln Alankar theatre.
Among 500 people I designed it with twelve 9 mm bullets.
I don't think your dear son will die before giving. .
". . fire to your pyre, father. "
He escaped death.
"Why are you shivering in that way, father?"
I didn't even tell you about your daughter's. .
. . and son-in-law's death yet.
"You are wondering if I am really your son or not, right?"
Look at me.
Look at the traitor you brought up.
Look at the ruthlessness of your son whom you ignored.
You left your son and supported an outsider.
Look what is left for you now.
Idiot.
"Hey, what do you know about your father?
ldiot. idiot. "
"Look at the properties, FDs and dollar accounts. . "
. . that I saved for you.
God defeated me by sending you into my life.
Because of you I mortgaged my
What would you achieve by killing your kin?
I sent men to kill my loyal Basha.
Why?
For you.
For you.
O God!
What will you achieve by joining politics?
You don't need that life filled with bloodshed and conspiracies.
Let him live with that muck.
Enjoy my immense wealth.
Live happily.
Live happily.
I will have to save you from him at any cost now.
"Hey!
- Mitra.
Mitra, stop.
- Father, leave me. "
"Mitra, listen to me.
Stop.
- Father, leave me.
- Mitra. "
Hey!
Get into the van.
Leave me.
Hey!
I killed many a toughies in my 20 years of service.
What chance do you have?
- Gowda.
Don't forget that he is also my son.
He is like my son.
My heart is shattering into pieces. .
. . for whatever injustice happened.
But we have to stop this bloodshed here.
"lf we stop it here dharma won't survive, father. "
Then listen. .
However he is it's my dharma as a father to save my son.
"l have no father other than you, father. "
If you want to save your son kill me right here.
In Andhra Pradesh's state assembly elections. .
. .
Gannavaram's constituency's verdict has been passed. .
. . after recounting the votes twice.
The present MLA Lokanatham defeated his. .
. . nearest opponent Partha Sarathi by just 32 votes.
It's a fraud. lt's a fraud.
It's a bigger fraud than George Bush's election in America.
They announced different verdicts after each counting.
Finally as his party came into power. .
. . he made this counting final.
This is injustice. lt's unfair.
They paid money and influenced the counting.
It's unfair. lt's injustice.
We will call for a strike all over the state tomorrow.
Long live. .

"Hey, you change sides just half an hour after. . "
. . winning the election?
Shame on you!
- Get lost.
"Get lost, you idiot!
Control yourself. "
Hey!
"Congrats, sir!
That was an empathic victory. "
"Here, you got the education ministry. "
You take care this college proposal. .
. . and I will take care of those granite sites.
Your son is safe.
Even Mr. Reddy doesn't know. .
. . where he is.
But revenge will keep chasing him wherever we hide him.
To be on the safe side we should take the first step.
"Hey, you!
You think he is ruthless enough. . "
. . to kill his own son?
Shut up!
Sometimes we have to amputate our own body parts. .
". . to survive, sir.
- Hey, stop the car once. "
"Don't take undue advantage of your position, Reddy. "
If you want there to be light in your home. .
. . make sure my light doesn't go off.
They wrote in the report that it was a 'theft and murder' case.
The one who killed them is enjoying in the club. .
For you we are ready to kill or sacrifice.
For Loki till that son is alive this son is an enemy.
Unwillingly you are entangled in a war.
"Now there only two ways left, either kill or die.
Come. "

Your death will reduce the burden on earth.
Hey!
For power you should be ready to give or take lives.
Kill me.
Kill me.
Bring out the animal in you.
Why are you stepping back?
You see a brother in me?
You can't kill me.
"Hey, you can't kill me. "
Now you will die in my hands.
"He's not Chinna, right?"
It has begun.
"What will I do with my life now, Lord?"
"Did Basha kill him?
- lt's not Basha, sir. "
Look what your son did to my son.
For your family I sacrificed my entire life.
Look what I got in return.
I lived for the village.
I lived for the people.
But in the end I couldn't live for my son.
"My eyes can't stop. . "
". . the flow of tears today. "
Chinna.
"All the dreams have been. . "
". . shattered today. "
"Whom shall I live for now, God?"
Whom shall I live for now?
"The sky is covered. . "

"This wealth, this status, this power. . "
Will I leave it for someone else's son?

What is left there for me?
"lt has made me immune to all other pains. "
"lt has made me immune to all other pains. "
'Only till there is happiness in my heart I am a family man. '
'Only till my son is alive I am a father. '
Now I am the dark past.
I am an animal.
All these days we lived for leaders and got fooled.
We need a leader who would live for us.
We need a leader who has ethics and compassion.
"Sir.
Sir.
Sir.
Sir.
Sir, stop.
Please don't go inside. "
"We are not new guests.
- Sir is not well, sir. "
He didn't even drink water since a week.
- So?
You think we will let him die?
"We have invested a lot of him.
Move aside.
- Your wish, sir. "
You are going inside. I don't know if you will come outside.
"Hey, my eyes are burning.
Close the doors. "
In another 10-15 days you have to. .
. . take the oath as the minister.
How can you sit here in such a dull manner?
Will you also die along with the one who died?
Listen.
Drink water.
If you keep mourning here all day long. .
. . your son who killed your son is snatching your men. .
. . and is becoming their leader.
Till you stand him he can't be crushed.
Now it's up to you if you kill him. .
. . or give him the reigns of power.
That's all.
Stop it!
Stop your rubbish and sit outside.
That's not the thing. .
- You will be called when needed.
Go.
"Gowda, you stay there. "
"Don't mind what Mr. Reddy said, sir. "
It was a different matter when Chinna was alive.
You are already mourning your son.
At this time you need to think calmly. .
. . instead of getting aggressive.
You worthless fellow!
Only because you couldn't finish the job I gave you on time. .
. . that my life has become like this.
What is left with me to think calmly?
What is left with me?
What is left with me?
"You got angry?
- lt's alright, sir. "
You are chasing me since four years for promotion.
You would bear anything.
You would do anything.
"That amount is for you.
- l got it, sir. "
"That amount is for you.
- l got it, sir. "
"That amount is for you.
- l got it, sir!"
What did you get?
- That I have to bring another dead body.
Till then have some food and stay alive.
Two dead bodies.
Basha too.
If I don't get promotion in two months. .
. . you will be the third dead body.
In a day or two there is the granite sites' hearing.
"Kill that Durga as well, while you are at it. "
There will be no villains left for this term.
If dust settles down there is a danger. .
. . that father and son would join hands.
It's you. lt's you.
- lt's you. - lt's you.
You are out. lt's you.
- lt's you.
It's you.
Didn't I tell you that sister's clothes. .
. . will always be beside uncle's clothes?
- So what?
"They will get married.
- Get lost, idiot. "
"Hey, what rubbish are you talking?"
Will you marry uncle?
"Hey, if you don't stop talking rubbish I will spank you both. "
Come and remove the clothes both of you.
We understood it with your style of arranging clothes.
Shut your mouth and go.
Go and ask your uncle about it.
Get lost.
Uncle fell for you a long ago.
It's you who is throwing attitude.
"Your eyes are like a quagmire. "

Flash news.
The stay order passed by Supreme court. .
. . three months ago on Manikota granite lands. .
. . has been cancelled today.
And in a separate incident. .
. . the granite land victims' representative. .
. .
Durga Prasad has died.
Basi Reddy denied. .
. . his involvement in this incident.
So that's all for now.
Goodnight.
O God!
They ruthlessly killed him right in front of my child.
He worked tirelessly all his life like a dog for those leaders.
And now he abandoned us in this way.
The whole of Bejawada must be turned upside down.
If we stay quiet they will think we are cowards.
Basi Reddy must be killed by morning.
He thinks only he can kill people.
"Look, she finished her homework like a good girl. "
What have you been doing since morning?
This is the public proposal on granite lands.
He is Durga's son.
Now it's up to you if tomorrow morning. .
. . he holds a book and goes to school. .
. . or holds a knife and goes for Basi Reddy.
You too know that in this scam along with wealthy contractors. .
. . they are some influential politicians as well.
But today nothing is more powerful. .
. . than the fire of revenge in their eyes.
"Collector, I am giving you 24 hours' time to stop this wave. "
After that I will also hold a knife and be one of them.
She is not a small girl.
She is a goon. - Idiot.
Someone's there.
Someone's there.
Someone's there.
- Come inside.
- Someone's there.
Who's there?
Who's that?
"Hey!
- Salaba, you go that side.
I will search here. "
Who's there?
I have got nothing to do with this. I swear.
What happened?
- l think there's some outsider.
Thrash him.
- He doesn't belong to this province.
"Buddy.
Buddy.
- Hey, stop it!"
What's with you?
Why did you come at this time like a thief?
"l failed las exams, buddy.
- So earlier you thought. . "
. . you would pass the exam?
Take him inside. .
". . and give him a hot bath.
- Hey, leave me. "
Basha.
Basha.
Basha.
"Basha, stop. "
Hello!
- Target has missed.
Some Basha came to his rescue.
Basha ruined our lives.
I will go home and send people to him.
You must stay inside home and lock the doors. .
. . and be a bit careful.
- There's no need for that.
"You go and sleep, Reddy. "
My hunting is not for revenge.
Not even for life.
It is to stop a truth.
It's common to miss the target.
If not today we will get him tomorrow.
"There are no targets left, Reddy.
You go and sleep. "
"Basha, stop. "
We can't stop all accident in life.
"l can't see you roaming like a mad man, Basha. "
"Unable to face you I am following you like a shadow, sir. "
All these days I lived like a loyal dog. .
". . but I forgot to live like a human being, sir. "
O Allah!
"Basha, faster. .
Drive faster. "
"Keshava, we will reach the hospital.
Hang on. "
I won't survive for more than ten minutes now.
"Basha, drive faster.
- Water.
- Keshava, water. . "
"Keshava, water. "
"Keshava.
- Loke, after my death. . "
". . will you stand in my place?
- You will be fine, Keshava. "
"Will you be my children's father, my father's son. . "
"You will be fine, Keshava.
-. . as this village's leader. . "
"Will you stand in my place?
- You will be fine, Keshava. "
'As this village's leader will you stand in my place?
'
'As this village's leader will you stand in my place?
'
Keshava.
"Basha, stop the jeep. "
"How can I bear this sin, lord?"
O God!
O God!
"Basha, I committed a sin. "
I killed Keshava.
Go and tell senior sir.
Tell him to cut me into pieces right here.
Tell him.
I am not senior master's man.
I am your man. I came here with you.
I stay here with you.
Your loyalty lies with your master.
My loyalty lies with my master.
"Start the van, Basha. "
Talking about this crime is more painful. .
. . than hiding this truth.
I couldn't carry this burden anymore and so I told you.
"Basha. - l can't carry this burden anymore, sir. "
I can't.
I. .
Kill me.
Still I am in the shock of the truth.
Before the truth sinks in kill me.
You are leaving me because truth is more painful than death?
Twenty Five years. .
For 25 years you have hidden your sin. .
. . in the home where you committed it.
Even if we search all the epics we won't find. .
. . a more sinister character than you.
No punishment can equate your crime.
Look at those glorious epics once.
Except those who would do anything to meet their motives. .
. . there are no heroes or villains in these stories.
There is only one deep-rooted dharma in everyone.
Ego.
The only truth that moves this world is Hunger.
Only one entity dominates every soul.
Greed.
When greed dominates your mind stops working.
Truth and integrity become weak in front of it.
"That day, that moment. . "
. . for a mistake I committed overpowered by these feelings. .
. .
I have been paying for it all my life.
"As a father, as a husband I am paying for it. "
If it was a preplanned crime. .
. .
I would've killed and buried the truth that day itself.
To cross this juncture in my journey. .
. . both of you will have to die.
All the signs that would remind me of my past. .
. . should be destroyed.
Basha.
You will kill me?
Kill me.
Take your revenge.
Kill me.
I can't live in your light.
You turned me into darkness.
You have come to see this truth?
Look at me.
Look at me.
Look at me and swallow this darkness.
"Kill me.
Kill me.
Kill me.
- l didn't come to kill you, father. "
There's so much love to sacrifice my life. .
". . but still I don't get enough anger to kill you, father. "
You are my only truth.
If you turn into a lie I won't be able to bear it.
I am unable to bear it.
If he was alive I may not have loved. .
. . my father as well this much.
lgnorant about who my father was. .
". .
I held your finger and roamed around, father. "
But still if the fire of your anger will be doused with my life. .
. . you can take it.
Take it.
I didn't understand what you said. .
. . but will you end this story without dousing your fire?
Will you hide this truth from my Goddess?
"The burning of fire is an illusion. "
"Every emotion in your heart is an illusion. "
"Karma is illusion.
Destiny is illusion. "
"The biggest illusion of all is life. "
'Like darkness and light. . '
'. . battle between good and evil always go on inside us. '
'That never ending journey is this human journey. '
'What one sows is what one reaps. '
"Journey!
Journey!"
"Let's march towards our destination. "
"Life!
This life. . "
"Life is more valuable than heaven, brother. "
"Love is in you, brother. "
"Share your love with all and get salvation, brother. "
"Vedas are in you. "
"With your vedic knowledge show path to everyone. "
"What's the need for hatred and acrimony. . "
". . hatred and acrimony. . "
"Whatever you have. . "
". . was given to you as a temporary gift?"
"Ask the air. .
Ask the air. . "
"Ask the earth. .
Ask the earth. . "
"Ask the air, ask the earth. . "
"Ask the rain and sky. .
- Ask them. . "
"Whatever you have. .
Whatever you have. . "
"Whatever you have will be gone tomorrow. "
"The fire is inside you, brother. "
"Ignite this fire and be guiding light for everyone. "
"Wisdom is inside you, brother. "
"Realize it for your own benefit, brother. "
6-3-4 combo.
5-5-5.
3-8-0 combo... 8-5-0.
- Unemployment may be high,
But our business is booming.
- Good take today.
- People need hope, I guess.
629...
- Thanks, Judy.
- 6-2-9.
That's $100.
- How much we make last week?
- $353,640, and the number that hit was 3-4-2.
- You're a gem.
That's what you are, a gem.
What we'd do without you, I have no idea.
- You'd need a computer.
- Computer, right.
Might as well put up a big sign,
Flashing my name and occupation in neon.
- Why would you want a neon sign flashing your name?
- We wouldn't.
That's the point.
That's why we're glad we have you here.
We don't need computers.
Dale, how you doin'?
- Ask her.
How am I doing, rain man?
- You made $370,000 this week on 8-0-6,
And my name's Judy.
- I still say we're paying out too much.
Our odds are better than lotto,
Better than online.
- Yeah, but our profit margin is way...
What is it, Judy?
- 76.2%.
- Yeah, let's not get greedy here, Dale, okay?
People take a risk, they come to us.
'cause they're more likely to win.
Right, Judy?
- Right, and because pay-out's...
- Hey!
I work here, too, you know.
You can skip the math gymnastics.
- Hey.
Who's that handsome guy?
- That's you, Larry,
And that's me.
- It's a joke, Judy.
- Oh.
Funny.
- Yeah.
- FBI!
All right, hands up high, moving slow!
Everybody!
Stand up!
Let me see your hands!
Up against the wall.
Let's go!
Move it!
Move!
Everyone!
Quick!
Now!
You, back there!
Let's go!
- But I...
I have a lot of work to do.
- I don't think you understand.
I'm an FBI Agent,
And you're under arrest.
- Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
- Okay.
Por aqui.
Gracias.
- What's going on, Reina?
- I hate to bother you again.
- Bother me?
Until last week, I'd barely ever heard from you.
You were quiet as a sniper.
How's everyone holding up since the break-in?
- Good.
Getting back to normal.
We were a little scared,
But the new security has been very helpful.
- A phone call to abq p.D.,
An email to a friend in private security.
It took me less than a lunch break.
You have to watch out.
Pharmaceuticals are currency,
And, unlike banks, free clinics don't have much
In the way of armed guards.
So what's the latest?
My "s" visa is about to expire in one week,
And if I don't get my green card,
I'm going to lose my job.
- I called the a.U.S.A. Last month,
And he assured me everything was in order.
- But I testified six months ago.
What is taking so long?
- Doubtless, the oppressive sluggishness of bureaucracy.
You know, Franz Kafka characters
Trying to enter castles and turning into bugs.
Red tape.
- Is it possible that immigration
Maybe changed their mind?
- You were promised a green card
As a condition of your testimony.
I'm sure there was just a snafu along the way
To approving the paperwork.
Don't worry.
I'll fix it.
- Gracias.
- Gracias.
Ciao, Marshall.
Proximo.
- The language of betting is rampant with bluster.
Its cup runneth over with metaphor.
Bluff, raise, tell,
Call, fold, hit,
Stand, bust.
Some say, stay in the box and do what you know.
They fret about crapshoots, to hell with jackpots.
They crave what's familiar and cling to routine.
So what's better,
Pulling up short of doubling down?
You think I know?
Don't bet on it.
- Hey.
- So, Scott, how long you in town?
- What, are you sick of me already?
I don't know.
I'm kind of playing it by ear.
I'm crashing at this little motel,
It's got a pool, a decent rate.
- And your life at home, your job?
- Have laptop, will travel.
Day-trading's all chasing numbers on the Internet.
- Huh.
- Let's take a look here.
Yeah, I just lost 17k on gold.
- Scott!
My God.
- Ah, don't sweat it.
I made 30 last week on a new malaria vaccine,
So I'm actually up a little bit...
For now.
Gotta love the bio-techs.
- Yeah.
It's good to see you're not gambling anymore.
You can get your fix right here,
You know, in my kitchen.
- Pretty much.
- Oh, speaking of that,
Uh, Scott invited me
To come to his gamblers anonymous meeting.
You want to come with?
- Yeah.
No, I'm running late,
And shoot me first.
- Well, any open meeting, Mary,
We'd love to have you.
Think you'd find it pretty compelling.
- Oh, well, I've already been,
And it wasn't.
- You have?
- Yeah.
I...
I went a while ago.
I had to drive a friend...
Just whatever.
I didn't get much out of it,
But, you know, burnt coffee and stale cookies.
Knock yourselves out.
Don't forget your tissues, though, and Xanax.
We'll share later.
- I'd apologize for her,
But I swear, if I start, I will never stop.
It's your turn.
- Ha ha.
- So what's the 411 on alfaro?
- The a.U.S.A. Says he doesn't understand what happened,
And Reina's paperwork was submitted.
- So what's the hold-up?
She made their case,
Put away some serious dirt-bag smugglers, right?
Give the woman a green card.
Who's the ice guy in charge here?
- Uh, the file says...
Jack Suarez.
- Jack Suarez?
- You know him?
- Oh, yeah, from the Paleozoic era.
We knocked heads on a joint task-force.
He was, uh...
Less than malleable.
- Is he a stand-up guy?
- Oh, a little too stand-up.
Talk about an Agent who would collar his own mom,
Suarez actually did, on a coke charge.
Got famous quick.
Lemme take a crack at this.
Forward me the info.
Good morning, Mary.
You have a new witness.
- It never ends.
What's her story?
- Challenging.
- In what sense?
- Key witness in an interstate numbers-running ring.
She was the accountant.
Feds kicked in the doors,
Only to find no computers, no files,
Not a hard drive in sight.
Just some phones, the odd betting slip,
And our Ms. Wagrowski in the conference room.
Kept every bet and payout
For the entire operation in her head.
- Meaning she's not the key witness in the case.
She is the case.
- Something exactly like that, yeah.
- So the challenge is, what,
Finally dealing with my intellectual equal?
- The challenge is she has asperger's,
And you're, you know.
You're you.
- Asperger's has a number of symptoms
Of which you should be aware.
- Oh, yippee, Marshall-pedia.
- Off-the-chart recall,
Total inability to relate emotionally on any level.
- So, my dream witness.
- Also, it's difficult for some people
With asperger's to lie,
Or even grasp the concept of lying.
- Which is why this is
Her third relocation in six months.
- Aces.
- She testifies in a few days.
If she blows her new identity again,
She's out of WITSEC.
- Since 1970, the federal Witness Protection program
Has relocated thousands of witnesses,
Some criminal, some not,
To neighborhoods all across the country.
Every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute,
Distinguishing them from the rest
Of the general population.
And that is, somebody wants them dead.
- So, Judy, this is your third relocation.
I'm sensing maybe the rules of WITSEC
Haven't been made entirely clear.
- They're clear.
I know the rules.
- Okay, then why all the breaches?
- They sent me to st.
Louis
And got me a job in a clothing store.
I told them I'm not good with people,
But no one listened,
And I ended up getting fired
Because I told a lady she looked fat and she told my boss.
I said, "this is a stupid job anyway
And my job with Larry in Pittsburgh was better for me."
- Which got you relocated.
- Yes.
- Was she fat?
- Of course she was fa
Why would I say she was if she wasn't?
- Love it.
Then they sent you to San Francisco.
What happened there?
- At the museum where they placed me,
A co-worker wanted to know what High School I went to,
So I told her the cover story.
And when she googled me and couldn't find my name,
I said it's because she wasn't looking under the right name
Because my real name isn't Judy Stevens,
And she was looking under Judy Stevens.
I don't understand why I have to lie all the time.
- It's for your safety.
- I don't like lying.
I don't understand it.
Lying's very stressful.
- You want stressful?
Keep telling people your real name.
The men you're testifying against will find you,
And they will hurt you.
- Larry would never hurt me.
- Larry is...
- The former employer you're testifying against.
- A man who is very, very motivated to hurt you.
- Larry's my best friend.
- No, he was your best friend.
Was, Judy.
Not anymore.
You need to understand, you're testifying against him.
- The FBI asked me to explain Larry's business
And what my job was.
- And you know that what you will say
Will send him to jail.
- I can't perjure myself.
- No, that's right, you can't.
- I'm supposed to lie sometimes and not others?
How am I supposed to know when?
Judy, look.
- Okay, let's...
let's just talk about
Getting you settled here in Albuquerque before the trial.
What can you do?
- I can cook.
I can drive.
I can juggle.
- I think Mary means, what can you do for a living?
- That's not what she said.
- Oh, my God.
- You should mean what you say.
- You know what?
- Focus.
- Judy, let's see,
You were a bookkeeper for this Larry guy.
Maybe you'd like to try that again,
But, you know...
Minus the criminal part.
Man, you think you've seen every kind of witness there is.
- A few things you're gonna
Everything is literal with Judy.
Also, she can't really decipher visual cues...
Shoulder shrugs, raised eyebrows.
- Look, I know I'm not the smartest girl
In the room anymore,
But I think I have a pretty good handle
On the definition of "visual cues."
- She's obsessed with fairness and honesty,
So never lie to her.
And if you ask her to lie,
Expect a lack of comprehension at best.
- I can't comprehend how I'm still awake.
- Oh, and one more thing.
She absolutely cannot grasp
The life-blood of your repartee...
Bitter sarcasm...
So every second you're with her,
Try being someone other than who you actually are.
- Ooh, role-playing.
My favorite.
- I knew my dad for 23 years.
He was a good salesman, a bad golfer,
And a world-class storyteller.
Better than I knew, because it turns out what he told me...
Well, a lot of it...
It was a lie.
I never knew him.
Just a side of him,
The side that he wanted me to see,
Which was kind of like not knowing him at all.
But here's a shocker...
Something that I never knew, but I should have.
He was addicted to gambling.
Explains a lot, clearly.
But, um, I've got a lot to be grateful for,
Including two awesome sisters that I'm just getting to know.
And we are gonna crack the code of our old man together,
One way or another.
- Thanks.
- For what?
- A couple of months ago, if you hadn't called me
With a "hey, I'm your brother,"
I'd be, um...
Well, 10 grand poorer, anyway.
- Yeah, I've been meaning to ask you
What you're gonna do with the money.
I'm, uh, thinkin' about of betting it on the ponies.
I'm kidding.
But I did have an idea,
But it's stupid.
Um, I think about it, and all I can hear in my head
Is Mary calling me an idiot.
I don't know.
- Okay, so tell me.
And if I think that you're being an idiot,
You'll know it's not just knee-jerk.
It's that you are, in fact, an idiot.
You know you friend there iniami, jacy?
- Mm-hmm.
- She said...
I have what it takes, whatever "it" is,
And, um, I haven't stopped thinking about it since.
- Jack.
- Stan.
What's doin'?
- Reina alfaro.
- What about her?
- Well, her temp visa's about to run out,
And she needs that green card now.
- Yeah?
It's not gonna happen.
- Come on, her green card deal's with d.O.J.
- Doesn't exempt her.
From what?
- Let's just say certain information leads me to believe
She wouldn't exactly make a model U.S. Citizen.
- She commit a crime?
Let's see the charges.
- Stan, you're tellin' me she's in WITSEC?
- Come on, Jack, I'm not saying anything about WITSEC.
- See, here's the thing.
You know what you know, but you don't wanna share.
You think you have the market cornered on secrets?
- All I'm saying is this is someone who matters, all right?
Don't make me put a call in to the a.G.
- So this is an official request to back off?
- Yeah.
- Understood.
- Good.
I swear.
- Hey!
So Scott has the craziest dating story ever.
Some girl pushed her plate
Across the table with her nose,
Like that spaghetti scene in the dog movie.
Lady and the...
- and the tramp.
Yes, and if you think that is crazy,
On our second date,
She came back from the bathroom with a gun.
- What?
- Kept calling me sollozzo.
- Oh!
Uh, I know!
Godfather!
- Right.
- Godfather!
- Ooh, besties!
Now I know what all those
Junior high pajama parties were like.
Let me just go grab my Ouija board.
- Hey, uh, we're gonna meet Peter for drinks
A little bit later.
You want to come with?
- Thanks.
I've got a date with a bathtub
And a crappy Merlot.
- Tell her.
- She's in a bad mood.
- No, she's not.
What?
- Brandi has got a great idea for a new business.
- And bad mood in three, two, one...
- Oh, come on.
Okay, so it's not great,
But I think that I could do it and be good.
I'm going to be a masseuse.
- Oh, boy.
Sorry, are you serious?
- Yeah.
- Just, given your stellar past,
My mind goes right to the late-night call from vice.
- No, no, no, this is totally legit.
I have a friend in Florida, jacy, who does it as a living,
And she told Brandi she'd be amazing at it.
- Really?
Oh, well, I mean,
If jacy thinks she could do it.
Brandi, I mean, do you have any idea how many hours
It takes to train for that to even,
I don't know, get a license or whatever?
- 165 hours in anatomy and physiology, 75 hours in general instruction,
And 30 hours in professional ethics.
- Which is more time than you've ever spent doing anything,
And way more than you've ever even spent
Thinking about professional ethics.
- Okay, so there's a lot to do,
But from a business point of view, it's actually...
What is it?
- Low overhead, decent hourly wage,
Minimal advertising...
- Right, as long as you advertise
In a tank top and a pair of Daisy Dukes.
Seriously, Brandi,
I mean, the fact that you might be parlaying
Your assets here,
That isn't a factor in choosing this over,
Say, micro-processing?
I mean, does Peter know about this?
- I'm gonna surprise him.
- Excellent.
All right, well, when you tell him,
I want third row on the aisle.
He's gonna love this.
- Can I just ask you a question in a totally UN-hysterical way?
Why can't you see what "is" with me?
- Brandi.
Not what I was, what I did, or what I'm trying to be.
Okay, and you sure as hell aren't
Taking the time to try to get to know our brother.
- This your version of UN-hysterical?
- Yeah.
- Another quiet night at home with the shannons.
Your side of the family this much fun?
- We have our moments.
- Mmm.
- You know, she really could do this.
Oh, you got pineapple?
- And ham.
- Ugh.
There is no way we're from the same gene pool.
- Okay, hang tight.
Stan, I thought you said everything
With Reina and ice was set.
- What?
I told Suarez I wanted him to back off.
He said he understood.
- I guess when ice said "understood,"
They mean, "let's go to Reina's house
And interrogate the neighbors as to her whereabouts."
- Damn it.
Luckily, she just left for work
And they pretended not to know.
- Christ.
Uh, go scoop her up.
- What are we gonna do then,
Hide her from the U.S. Government?
- Pretty much.
Go.
I'll call you.
We'll figure this out on the fly.
- Mary.
Hey.
- Hey.
So thanks for that stock tip last week.
Made sure to avoid it like the plague.
- Good move.
It dipped.
- How's Judy working out?
- A godsend.
That woman has a head for numbers
Like no one I ever met.
Never writes anything down,
Doesn't need a computer.
- That's Judy.
- Brings me a coffee, two sugars,
Every morning at 9:00, every evening at 5:00.
- Man, I wish someone would do that for me.
- I don't drink coffee.
Ulcers.
- Huh.
Have you told her?
- Every day.
Doesn't seem to take.
- Well, I guess you knew the deal when you hired her.
- Yeah, no, listen,
She's exactly what I needed around here.
I don't know what I'd do without her.
- Well, you're about to find out, Howard.
I've come to pick her up
For our camp reunion, remember?
- Oh.
Reunion?
Judy said you were gonna see her old friend, Larry,
To testify.
- Testify?
No.
No, no, no.
No, Larry was our counselor.
We're going to give a testimonial.
- In Pittsburgh.
- Michigan, Judy.
Remember?
Yeah, it's Michigan.
Larry's from Pittsburgh, but the camp was in Michigan.
- But Judy said that you were...
- Well, like you said, dynamite with numbers.
- Ah.
- Judy, have fun.
I'll be counting the days till you get back.
- What are you talking about?
I haven't even left yet.
- All righty then.
Ready?
Have her back before you know it.
- Excuse me, we're looking for Reina alfaro.
- Reina alfaro.
Think she called in sick today.
- Her landlord saw her leave for work.
- I don't know what to tell you.
She never signed in.
- Reina, it's Marshall.
Where are you?
- In the basement.
- Okay, sit tight.
Is there any other way in?
- There's an entrance through the back, in the alley.
Hurry!
- Reina.
- Stan, a threat-assessment ruse
Is only gonna buy us a few days, tops.
- Well, we claim we don't know
Who was tracking Reina at the clinic.
We didn't get a good look at the guys.
The witness is in danger,
We're simply following WITSEC protocol.
- I would say we're on a fine line between honesty
And a profound breach,
But we crossed that line a mile back.
- I don't know what Suarez wants or why.
Until we figure it out, we do our job,
We keep her safe.
Hey, Reina, come on.
We got you a room, okay?
Can I help you with that?
What's the matter?
You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.
None of this is okay.
- Reina, easy.
We're here to help you.
- I did what I was asked, didn't I?
I was asked to testify.
I did.
I was asked to be patient.
I was.
I love this country,
I love my home.
I just want to be safe in it, that's all.
Is that so much?
- No, of course not.
- I'm asked and asked and asked,
And the more I say yes, the more I get in trouble!
- Things are a little crazy right now.
- No, you think I'm a victim.
Ice thinks I'm a criminal.
You know what I am?
I am a nurse.
That's all I ever wanted to do is help people,
And that's what gets me in trouble.
- Reina, what are you talking about?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
I'm just...
- This is a bureaucratic mix-up, that's all.
We'll sort it out.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm just tired.
- It's fine.
It'll all be fine.
We'll get you checked in,
You'll be trying to wrestle the TV remote from me
Inside of ten minutes.
- Okay, Judy.
You wait in here.
Inspector.
Call you when I'm ready for her.
- Will Larry be there?
- Yes.
Yes, he'll be sitting at the defense table
When you're on the witness stand, but...
He can't come near you,
And we'll be with you the whole time.
- I haven't seen Larry in six months,
Three weeks, and five days.
- Right.
And you know that once you testify, that'll be it.
You'll go back to Albuquerque
And never lay eyes on Larry again.
- He's not dying.
He's just going to jail.
People in jail get visitors all the time.
I've seen it, in movies.
- No, I know.
I'm not saying...
Look, Judy, the thing is,
You won't be able to visit him.
That's one of the rules.
- Maybe I can see him when he gets out.
- No, you'll have a new life.
That means no more Larry, ever.
- But he's my friend.
- No, he's not your...
Look, I don't think...
After today, there's a good chance
That Larry won't want to be your friend.
Let's just take it one step at a time, okay?
All you have to do today
Is answer the a.U.S.A.'s questions honestly.
That's it.
- How else would I answer them?
- No other way, Judy.
This part you've got down pat.
- You look funny in that shirt.
It looks weird on you.
- Like I said,
Down pat.
- Miss Wagrowksi,
The number would come in how?
- It was the last three digits
Of that day's purse at the track.
- So if the jackpot at the racetrack was 3,943.56...
- Then that day's number was 3-5-6.
Anyone who picked 3-5-6 as their number would win.
My job was to keep track of how much money had come in,
How much we were paying to the winners,
And how much was left.
- And where did you keep track of all that?
- In my head.
- Thank you, miss wagrowski.
No more questions.
- Let's recess for the day.
Court is adjourned.
- Hi, Larry.
- Judy, let's go.
- It's me, Judy.
Larry!
- Judy.
- Why didn't he wave ck to me?
- What?
- I waved at him, and he didn't wave back.
- Judy, I know this has gotta be confusing.
- I answered all the lawyer's questions.
What else was I supposed to do?
- Not a thing.
You did your job,
And you did it really, really well.
- I told the truth,
And he won't wave at me, won't say hello,
Like he doesn't even know me.
- Judy.
- And you want me to lie.
You want me to say my name isn't my name
And my job isn't my job and my friend isn't my friend.
- Whoa.
Jesus, Judy, just take a take a breath.
- All I wanted when I was little was a friend,
Just one.
They'd come over to my house,
And they'd want to leave as soon as they got there.
And then I met Larry,
And I finally had a friend,
And he never thought I was weird.
And now he's gone.
I just lost my only friend.
- No, look.
- Now I'm gonna be alone
For the rest of my life.
- Okay, Judy.
- Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!
I don't like it, I don't like being touched.
- Okay, okay.
Judy, it's okay.
Look, just give us a little space?
- You're too close to me.
- Okay, I'm backing up, okay?
Look, I know it's hard,
The thought of losing your only friend,
But Larry was not your friend.
- Yes, he was.
Larry was my best friend.
- Okay, maybe he was,
But he took advantage of your abilities
To make money illegally.
He used you.
- I'm not doing this.
I don't want to testify anymore.
- Judy, you can't do that, okay?
You'll be kicked out of WITSEC.
You could be charged with a crime.
- I don't care.
I'm not lying anymore,
And I'm not hurting Larry.
- Look...
- leave me alone.
- Judy.
- Go!
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
I don't want to talk to you anymore!
- Okay.
Okay.
You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.
Let's just take a breath together, okay?
You and me.
- "a breath together" doesn't even make sense.
- Be right back, Judy.
Why don't you and the team take her back to the hotel, okay?
Get her secure.
Gotta find the a.U.S.A. And make sure he's got a heads-up.
- No problem.
- Judy.
Judy!
Inspector Lancaster's gonna take you back to the hotel, okay?
We can talk about tomorrow's testimony later.
- No.
No more testimony.
- She was fine a half an hour ago.
I mean, totally comped, a dream on the stand.
- Well, apparently alienating the only person
That ever mattered to her was more than she could take.
- How do you think she'll take it
When I charge her with accessory?
- She doesn't respond well to threats.
She responds to fairness and honesty.
She needs to be convinced that taking the stand
Equals doing what's right.
- I thought she understood that.
- She does.
She will.
It's just,
For her the world is...
Hang on.
What?
- She's gone.
- What?
Lancaster, tell me you're not talking about my witness.
- We were stopped at a street light,
She started saying, "coffee, two sugars,
Coffee, two sugars," over and over.
I saw a coffee shop, and we pulled over.
Thought maybe it would calm her down.
She bolted.
- You get paid for this, right?
I could get a guy off the street
If all I needed was someone to not keep track of witnesses.
Christ.
Keep looking.
Rry's home address, I need it.
- Wait a minute, what's happening?
- They lost Judy.
- Oh, no!
No!
No!
- Hey, how 'bout you be the only one around me
Not having a tizzy?
Could you do that?
Get me the goddamn address.
Come on.
- I just got off the phone with the deputy director.
He's either having a very bad day,
Or he's trying out some very creative new curse words.
- So he's not buying the threat assessment?
- I may have to cut Reina loose.
What do you got?
- Maybe nothing.
Kinda hope not, actually.
Those break-ins at the clinics.
- Yeah?
- I'm a little worried Reina's mixed up in this.
- Well, doesn't sound like her.
- I didn't think so, either.
But there was that thing she said,
Something about how helping people got her into trouble?
- And?
- All three clinics reported
Missing drugs and other items,
But not your typical recreational
Oxycontin and pain-killers.
We're talking penicillin,
Infant flu vaccine,
Blankets, diapers.
And the day before Reina calls me...
- Son of a bitch.
All right, you take Reina.
I got Suarez.
- Reina, I have a theory I'd like to run past you.
Someone comes to you and says
That there are babies in need of basic medical care,
But their parents are illegals
And too scared to bring them in, even to a clinic.
So you and some other Florence nightingales,
Along with doctors and orderlies,
Are asked to make a few supplies...
Disappear.
Am I close?
So ice starts connecting the dots,
Tracing vaccines and you to one of the breached clinics,
Figuring an inside job.
Next thing you know,
Suarez shows up at your door
With his bravado and his badge.
Then what?
- He saw that my visa was about to expire,
And he said that he could help me
If I became his informant,
Reporting illegals.
But there was no way.
I didn't say no or yes,
And I couldn't tell you,
Because I knew I had committed a crime,
And I would have been kicked out.
I was only trying to help.
- Judy, what are you doing here?
- I want to talk to you.
I brought you coffee, two sugars.
Two sugars.
Sorry it's after 5:00.
- Where are your marshals?
- I came to see you, to explain.
- I trusted you.
I gave you a job when nobody would.
I'm your friend, Judy.
- I know.
- Then why are you hurting me?
That's not what friends do.
- I'm sorry!
I'm really sorry, Larry.
What do I do?
- Stop.
Just stop talking, stop hurting me.
Be my friend.
Look, you gotta go.
You shouldn't be here.
I'm out on bail.
Just go.
Go!
- Was that the friggin' retard?
- Don't call her that.
That girl is smarter than you, me, and 90% of the city.
- Larry, think.
If that was her and she's on her own,
We got a window.
- What are you saying?
I'm saying we got an open window here.
You know everything about her,
She knows everything about you.
Where's she going, Larry?
That's all you need to tell me.
You don't need to know anything else.
Tell me, Larry,
And it just happens.
Nature takin' its course.
You don't do a thing.
And then, like that,
We're out from under all of this.
- U.S. Marshals.
Where the hell is Judy?
- She's not with you?
- I swear to God, I've got a rainy day fund
For when I get suspended without pay,
And I am this close to dipping into it.
Where's Judy?
Coffee, two sugars.
She's a little late today.
What the hell did you do to her?
- Nothin'.
I swear, nothing.
- Larry, Judy cares about you.
Look, she risked her life to come here
To talk to you, to try to explain something
She doesn't even understand.
To make things right.
So if you know where she is,
Do the right thing.
Be a friend.
Every day after work, she'd go to highland park
And get a hot dog with Sauerkraut
And sit on a bench.
- We're moving.
- Okay, three that way,
Two that way.
Weapon!
- Drop the knife!
drop it!
Get an a.P.B. Out on the goddamn car!
- Here's the thing, Jack.
All right?
No flexing, no threats,
No going to your boss or mine,
Just you and me, talking off the rec, all right?
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.
Reina made a mistake.
- She committed a crime.
- All right, all right.
- I offered her a chance to clean that up.
- To be fair, you tried to leverage her
Into being an informant
Because she was scared, all right?
Now, you didn't step outside the lines,
But from where you're sitting,
Reina's just another name on a pile of illegals,
All right?
Let me tell you something, Jack.
Reina's a hero, all right?
She is here because she's a patriot.
- Yeah?
How's that?
- Uh, I can't tell you.
Okay?
But if I could, I would tell you
That when she had the choice to hide or tell the truth,
This woman stood up.
She risked her life for a country
That wasn't even hers yet.
Don't tell me she blew it
Funneling surplus flu vaccine to a kid with a cold.
Don't tell me that.
Jack...
This is in your hands.
Do this thing for me.
Whatever it is down the line, I owe you.
- Witness is secure.
- Not yet, she's not.
Is that your chief?
- Yeah.
- Tell him he's got a long report headed his way,
Your name all over it.
Let's go, Judy.
- Who was that man?
- God.
- How'd you know where I was?
- Come on.
- Where are we going?
- Back to the hotel.
I don't care if you watch TV, order room service,
Or stand on your head.
Tomorrow, though, you're going to court.
- But, Mary, I...
- If you don't want to testify, don't, fine.
But there are consequences.
- What kind of consequences?
- You'll be arrested, Judy!
You'll be arrested.
Jesus!
I get that you're not good with people,
And I get that you only have one friend
And that lying makes you stressed.
I get you don't like to be touched, forget being hugged.
I'm not wild about handshakes.
In a lot of ways, I'm like you, Judy.
You minus the math skills.
And I've been trying, best I can,
To keep myself in check, to not be so...
Me.
And you know what?
You ran off anyway.
Because you don't need soft-spoken condescension
And... and taking breaths.
I sure as hell don't.
What we need is the truth, both of us,
Unvarnished and sugar-free,
And, frankly, that's all I've got left.
- That's called monologuing, what you just did.
I do it all the time.
- Judy,
You promised to testify.
Look, you said lying is hard for you,
"stressful," right?
Breaking a promise, that's...
- The same thing as lying.
- Exactly.
Did you ever promise you wouldn't testify against Larry?
- No.
We only talked about numbers,
Baseball, and the Pittsburgh steelers.
- And you understand that what he was doing,
What you were helping him do, was illegal.
That you were breaking the law,
And the law is...
- A promise.
I know that.
- I need you to trust me.
I know it's not easy.
It's a gamble.
Everything is.
I think you should gamble on me.
Okay, I might not be the best person,
But I'm a good bet.
My job is to keep you safe.
If you don't go to court tomorrow and tell what you know,
You will not be safe,
And that's a promise, too.
- You smell bad.
- Can you identify Lawrence silvers?
Please note for the record
The witness has identified the defendant, Lawrence silvers.
And what was the nature of your relationship?
- He said he was my friend.
I don't know if that was true or not.
But he was my employer.
That's true.
That I can prove.
- Hey, Howard, how you doin'?
- Ohh, tough week.
How was your trip?
- Good.
It was good.
It was a good week.
What can I do to help?
- It's just a mess.
I can't find Mrs. Anderson's I.R.A. Information.
Now she wants to make a deposit.
- Remember you asked me to transfer
Mrs. Anderson's assets to the short-term Cd?
I've been keeping track from the road.
She's up at 31/2%.
Tell her. 31/2%.
- Judy, you're a godsend.
- Would you like some coffee?
Two sugars, right?
- I'd love some.
Uh, a lot of milk, though.
Uh, mostly milk.
Mrs. Anderson, yeah, I have it right here.
It looks like you're up 31/2.
Uh-huh.
- Would you like some coffee, Mary?
- Empanadas.
- My mother's recipe.
I just wanted to thank you
For everything you did to help me.
- We were just doing our job, Reina.
- And you're sure that my temporary green card
Is not going to expire?
- Agent Suarez and I have reached
An interagency understanding.
- Muchas gracias...
To both of you.
Okay, enjoy.
Ciao.
- Ciao.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Holy mother, what is that smell?
- Homemade empanadas.
- What kind?
- Mine, that's what kind.
- How come you get the witnesses who cook you food,
And I get the ones who can multiply
Very large numbers in their head?
- It is commonly referred to as karma.
- Tu empanadas es mi empanadas.
- Actually, it would be, "tus empanadas son mis empanadas."
- So, in High School,
Who didn't hate you?
- Actually, I was both well-liked
And widely admired.
How's Judy?
- Adjusting to change.
- Hey.
Who isn't?
- One, two, three.
- Okay, that meeting was intense.
That one guy...
I mean, how do you lose ten dry-cleaning businesses
In one poker game?
- How?
- Listen, Brandi,
I, uh...
I might need that 10 grand back.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
You know, my business it's cash out, cash in.
I've just had a brutal run the last couple days.
But I will get it back, I swear.
- But I need that money to start my business.
- I know that,
And you're gonna get it back with a big profit,
Just like last time.
But the thing is, I...
You know, I kinda need it soon.
- Like, how soon?
- Hey.
- Mary, what are you doing here?
- Well...
Look, this isn't my thing, you know.
It's probably never gonna be.
I mean, if you want to sit in a circle and talk to me,
It's gotta be at a table
With rib-eyes and a bottle of scotch.
I'm buying.
- Well, now, that sounds good.
I'm up for that.
- Squish, rib-eyes, this way.
Chop chop.
You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Let's go.
- What I told Judy that day on the hill was true.
Trusting anything...
your family, your instincts,
The dim-witted anchor on the 10:00 news...
It's all a gamble,
With plenty of promises and no guarantees.
But I'm finding the longer I live,
No matter how often I fall on my face,
That folding's for losers, that winners take hits.
Call it going all-in, call it rolling the dice.
Screw hedging your bets.
Bluff, raise, call, stand, again and again.
6-3-4 combo.
5-5-5.
3-8-0 combo... 8-5-0.
- Unemployment may be high,
But our business is booming.
- Good take today.
- People need hope, I guess.
629...
- Thanks, Judy.
- 6-2-9.
That's $100.
- How much we make last week?
- $353,640, and the number that hit was 3-4-2.
- You're a gem.
That's what you are, a gem.
What we'd do without you, I have no idea.
- You'd need a computer.
- Computer, right.
Might as well put up a big sign,
Flashing my name and occupation in neon.
- Why would you want a neon sign flashing your name?
- We wouldn't.
That's the point.
That's why we're glad we have you here.
We don't need computers.
Dale, how you doin'?
- Ask her.
How am I doing, rain man?
- You made $370,000 this week on 8-0-6,
And my name's Judy.
- I still say we're paying out too much.
Our odds are better than lotto,
Better than online.
- Yeah, but our profit margin is way...
What is it, Judy?
- 76.2%.
- Yeah, let's not get greedy here, Dale, okay?
People take a risk, they come to us.
'cause they're more likely to win.
Right, Judy?
- Right, and because pay-out's...
- Hey!
I work here, too, you know.
You can skip the math gymnastics.
- Hey.
Who's that handsome guy?
- That's you, Larry,
And that's me.
- It's a joke, Judy.
- Oh.
Funny.
- Yeah.
- FBI!
All right, hands up high, moving slow!
Everybody!
Stand up!
Let me see your hands!
Up against the wall.
Let's go!
Move it!
Move!
Everyone!
Quick!
Now!
You, back there!
Let's go!
- But I...
I have a lot of work to do.
- I don't think you understand.
I'm an FBI Agent,
And you're under arrest.
- Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
- Okay.
Por aqui.
Gracias.
- What's going on, Reina?
- I hate to bother you again.
- Bother me?
Until last week, I'd barely ever heard from you.
You were quiet as a sniper.
How's everyone holding up since the break-in?
- Good.
Getting back to normal.
We were a little scared,
But the new security has been very helpful.
- A phone call to abq p.D.,
An email to a friend in private security.
It took me less than a lunch break.
You have to watch out.
Pharmaceuticals are currency,
And, unlike banks, free clinics don't have much
In the way of armed guards.
So what's the latest?
My "s" visa is about to expire in one week,
And if I don't get my green card,
I'm going to lose my job.
- I called the a.U.S.A. Last month,
And he assured me everything was in order.
- But I testified six months ago.
What is taking so long?
- Doubtless, the oppressive sluggishness of bureaucracy.
You know, Franz Kafka characters
Trying to enter castles and turning into bugs.
Red tape.
- Is it possible that immigration
Maybe changed their mind?
- You were promised a green card
As a condition of your testimony.
I'm sure there was just a snafu along the way
To approving the paperwork.
Don't worry.
I'll fix it.
- Gracias.
- Gracias.
Ciao, Marshall.
Proximo.
- The language of betting is rampant with bluster.
Its cup runneth over with metaphor.
Bluff, raise, tell,
Call, fold, hit,
Stand, bust.
Some say, stay in the box and do what you know.
They fret about crapshoots, to hell with jackpots.
They crave what's familiar and cling to routine.
So what's better,
Pulling up short of doubling down?
You think I know?
Don't bet on it.
- Hey.
- So, Scott, how long you in town?
- What, are you sick of me already?
I don't know.
I'm kind of playing it by ear.
I'm crashing at this little motel,
It's got a pool, a decent rate.
- And your life at home, your job?
- Have laptop, will travel.
Day-trading's all chasing numbers on the Internet.
- Huh.
- Let's take a look here.
Yeah, I just lost 17k on gold.
- Scott!
My God.
- Ah, don't sweat it.
I made 30 last week on a new malaria vaccine,
So I'm actually up a little bit...
For now.
Gotta love the bio-techs.
- Yeah.
It's good to see you're not gambling anymore.
You can get your fix right here,
You know, in my kitchen.
- Pretty much.
- Oh, speaking of that,
Uh, Scott invited me
To come to his gamblers anonymous meeting.
You want to come with?
- Yeah.
No, I'm running late,
And shoot me first.
- Well, any open meeting, Mary,
We'd love to have you.
Think you'd find it pretty compelling.
- Oh, well, I've already been,
And it wasn't.
- You have?
- Yeah.
I...
I went a while ago.
I had to drive a friend...
Just whatever.
I didn't get much out of it,
But, you know, burnt coffee and stale cookies.
Knock yourselves out.
Don't forget your tissues, though, and Xanax.
We'll share later.
- I'd apologize for her,
But I swear, if I start, I will never stop.
It's your turn.
- Ha ha.
- So what's the 411 on alfaro?
- The a.U.S.A. Says he doesn't understand what happened,
And Reina's paperwork was submitted.
- So what's the hold-up?
She made their case,
Put away some serious dirt-bag smugglers, right?
Give the woman a green card.
Who's the ice guy in charge here?
- Uh, the file says...
Jack Suarez.
- Jack Suarez?
- You know him?
- Oh, yeah, from the Paleozoic era.
We knocked heads on a joint task-force.
He was, uh...
Less than malleable.
- Is he a stand-up guy?
- Oh, a little too stand-up.
Talk about an Agent who would collar his own mom,
Suarez actually did, on a coke charge.
Got famous quick.
Lemme take a crack at this.
Forward me the info.
Good morning, Mary.
You have a new witness.
- It never ends.
What's her story?
- Challenging.
- In what sense?
- Key witness in an interstate numbers-running ring.
She was the accountant.
Feds kicked in the doors,
Only to find no computers, no files,
Not a hard drive in sight.
Just some phones, the odd betting slip,
And our Ms. Wagrowski in the conference room.
Kept every bet and payout
For the entire operation in her head.
- Meaning she's not the key witness in the case.
She is the case.
- Something exactly like that, yeah.
- So the challenge is, what,
Finally dealing with my intellectual equal?
- The challenge is she has asperger's,
And you're, you know.
You're you.
- Asperger's has a number of symptoms
Of which you should be aware.
- Oh, yippee, Marshall-pedia.
- Off-the-chart recall,
Total inability to relate emotionally on any level.
- So, my dream witness.
- Also, it's difficult for some people
With asperger's to lie,
Or even grasp the concept of lying.
- Which is why this is
Her third relocation in six months.
- Aces.
- She testifies in a few days.
If she blows her new identity again,
She's out of WITSEC.
- Since 1970, the federal Witness Protection program
Has relocated thousands of witnesses,
Some criminal, some not,
To neighborhoods all across the country.
Every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute,
Distinguishing them from the rest
Of the general population.
And that is, somebody wants them dead.
- So, Judy, this is your third relocation.
I'm sensing maybe the rules of WITSEC
Haven't been made entirely clear.
- They're clear.
I know the rules.
- Okay, then why all the breaches?
- They sent me to st.
Louis
And got me a job in a clothing store.
I told them I'm not good with people,
But no one listened,
And I ended up getting fired
Because I told a lady she looked fat and she told my boss.
I said, "this is a stupid job anyway
And my job with Larry in Pittsburgh was better for me."
- Which got you relocated.
- Yes.
- Was she fat?
- Of course she was fa
Why would I say she was if she wasn't?
- Love it.
Then they sent you to San Francisco.
What happened there?
- At the museum where they placed me,
A co-worker wanted to know what High School I went to,
So I told her the cover story.
And when she googled me and couldn't find my name,
I said it's because she wasn't looking under the right name
Because my real name isn't Judy Stevens,
And she was looking under Judy Stevens.
I don't understand why I have to lie all the time.
- It's for your safety.
- I don't like lying.
I don't understand it.
Lying's very stressful.
- You want stressful?
Keep telling people your real name.
The men you're testifying against will find you,
And they will hurt you.
- Larry would never hurt me.
- Larry is...
- The former employer you're testifying against.
- A man who is very, very motivated to hurt you.
- Larry's my best friend.
- No, he was your best friend.
Was, Judy.
Not anymore.
You need to understand, you're testifying against him.
- The FBI asked me to explain Larry's business
And what my job was.
- And you know that what you will say
Will send him to jail.
- I can't perjure myself.
- No, that's right, you can't.
- I'm supposed to lie sometimes and not others?
How am I supposed to know when?
Judy, look.
- Okay, let's...
let's just talk about
Getting you settled here in Albuquerque before the trial.
What can you do?
- I can cook.
I can drive.
I can juggle.
- I think Mary means, what can you do for a living?
- That's not what she said.
- Oh, my God.
- You should mean what you say.
- You know what?
- Focus.
- Judy, let's see,
You were a bookkeeper for this Larry guy.
Maybe you'd like to try that again,
But, you know...
Minus the criminal part.
Man, you think you've seen every kind of witness there is.
- A few things you're gonna
Everything is literal with Judy.
Also, she can't really decipher visual cues...
Shoulder shrugs, raised eyebrows.
- Look, I know I'm not the smartest girl
In the room anymore,
But I think I have a pretty good handle
On the definition of "visual cues."
- She's obsessed with fairness and honesty,
So never lie to her.
And if you ask her to lie,
Expect a lack of comprehension at best.
- I can't comprehend how I'm still awake.
- Oh, and one more thing.
She absolutely cannot grasp
The life-blood of your repartee...
Bitter sarcasm...
So every second you're with her,
Try being someone other than who you actually are.
- Ooh, role-playing.
My favorite.
- I knew my dad for 23 years.
He was a good salesman, a bad golfer,
And a world-class storyteller.
Better than I knew, because it turns out what he told me...
Well, a lot of it...
It was a lie.
I never knew him.
Just a side of him,
The side that he wanted me to see,
Which was kind of like not knowing him at all.
But here's a shocker...
Something that I never knew, but I should have.
He was addicted to gambling.
Explains a lot, clearly.
But, um, I've got a lot to be grateful for,
Including two awesome sisters that I'm just getting to know.
And we are gonna crack the code of our old man together,
One way or another.
- Thanks.
- For what?
- A couple of months ago, if you hadn't called me
With a "hey, I'm your brother,"
I'd be, um...
Well, 10 grand poorer, anyway.
- Yeah, I've been meaning to ask you
What you're gonna do with the money.
I'm, uh, thinkin' about of betting it on the ponies.
I'm kidding.
But I did have an idea,
But it's stupid.
Um, I think about it, and all I can hear in my head
Is Mary calling me an idiot.
I don't know.
- Okay, so tell me.
And if I think that you're being an idiot,
You'll know it's not just knee-jerk.
It's that you are, in fact, an idiot.
You know you friend there iniami, jacy?
- Mm-hmm.
- She said...
I have what it takes, whatever "it" is,
And, um, I haven't stopped thinking about it since.
- Jack.
- Stan.
What's doin'?
- Reina alfaro.
- What about her?
- Well, her temp visa's about to run out,
And she needs that green card now.
- Yeah?
It's not gonna happen.
- Come on, her green card deal's with d.O.J.
- Doesn't exempt her.
From what?
- Let's just say certain information leads me to believe
She wouldn't exactly make a model U.S. Citizen.
- She commit a crime?
Let's see the charges.
- Stan, you're tellin' me she's in WITSEC?
- Come on, Jack, I'm not saying anything about WITSEC.
- See, here's the thing.
You know what you know, but you don't wanna share.
You think you have the market cornered on secrets?
- All I'm saying is this is someone who matters, all right?
Don't make me put a call in to the a.G.
- So this is an official request to back off?
- Yeah.
- Understood.
- Good.
I swear.
- Hey!
So Scott has the craziest dating story ever.
Some girl pushed her plate
Across the table with her nose,
Like that spaghetti scene in the dog movie.
Lady and the...
- and the tramp.
Yes, and if you think that is crazy,
On our second date,
She came back from the bathroom with a gun.
- What?
- Kept calling me sollozzo.
- Oh!
Uh, I know!
Godfather!
- Right.
- Godfather!
- Ooh, besties!
Now I know what all those
Junior high pajama parties were like.
Let me just go grab my Ouija board.
- Hey, uh, we're gonna meet Peter for drinks
A little bit later.
You want to come with?
- Thanks.
I've got a date with a bathtub
And a crappy Merlot.
- Tell her.
- She's in a bad mood.
- No, she's not.
What?
- Brandi has got a great idea for a new business.
- And bad mood in three, two, one...
- Oh, come on.
Okay, so it's not great,
But I think that I could do it and be good.
I'm going to be a masseuse.
- Oh, boy.
Sorry, are you serious?
- Yeah.
- Just, given your stellar past,
My mind goes right to the late-night call from vice.
- No, no, no, this is totally legit.
I have a friend in Florida, jacy, who does it as a living,
And she told Brandi she'd be amazing at it.
- Really?
Oh, well, I mean,
If jacy thinks she could do it.
Brandi, I mean, do you have any idea how many hours
It takes to train for that to even,
I don't know, get a license or whatever?
- 165 hours in anatomy and physiology, 75 hours in general instruction,
And 30 hours in professional ethics.
- Which is more time than you've ever spent doing anything,
And way more than you've ever even spent
Thinking about professional ethics.
- Okay, so there's a lot to do,
But from a business point of view, it's actually...
What is it?
- Low overhead, decent hourly wage,
Minimal advertising...
- Right, as long as you advertise
In a tank top and a pair of Daisy Dukes.
Seriously, Brandi,
I mean, the fact that you might be parlaying
Your assets here,
That isn't a factor in choosing this over,
Say, micro-processing?
I mean, does Peter know about this?
- I'm gonna surprise him.
- Excellent.
All right, well, when you tell him,
I want third row on the aisle.
He's gonna love this.
- Can I just ask you a question in a totally UN-hysterical way?
Why can't you see what "is" with me?
- Brandi.
Not what I was, what I did, or what I'm trying to be.
Okay, and you sure as hell aren't
Taking the time to try to get to know our brother.
- This your version of UN-hysterical?
- Yeah.
- Another quiet night at home with the shannons.
Your side of the family this much fun?
- We have our moments.
- Mmm.
- You know, she really could do this.
Oh, you got pineapple?
- And ham.
- Ugh.
There is no way we're from the same gene pool.
- Okay, hang tight.
Stan, I thought you said everything
With Reina and ice was set.
- What?
I told Suarez I wanted him to back off.
He said he understood.
- I guess when ice said "understood,"
They mean, "let's go to Reina's house
And interrogate the neighbors as to her whereabouts."
- Damn it.
Luckily, she just left for work
And they pretended not to know.
- Christ.
Uh, go scoop her up.
- What are we gonna do then,
Hide her from the U.S. Government?
- Pretty much.
Go.
I'll call you.
We'll figure this out on the fly.
- Mary.
Hey.
- Hey.
So thanks for that stock tip last week.
Made sure to avoid it like the plague.
- Good move.
It dipped.
- How's Judy working out?
- A godsend.
That woman has a head for numbers
Like no one I ever met.
Never writes anything down,
Doesn't need a computer.
- That's Judy.
- Brings me a coffee, two sugars,
Every morning at 9:00, every evening at 5:00.
- Man, I wish someone would do that for me.
- I don't drink coffee.
Ulcers.
- Huh.
Have you told her?
- Every day.
Doesn't seem to take.
- Well, I guess you knew the deal when you hired her.
- Yeah, no, listen,
She's exactly what I needed around here.
I don't know what I'd do without her.
- Well, you're about to find out, Howard.
I've come to pick her up
For our camp reunion, remember?
- Oh.
Reunion?
Judy said you were gonna see her old friend, Larry,
To testify.
- Testify?
No.
No, no, no.
No, Larry was our counselor.
We're going to give a testimonial.
- In Pittsburgh.
- Michigan, Judy.
Remember?
Yeah, it's Michigan.
Larry's from Pittsburgh, but the camp was in Michigan.
- But Judy said that you were...
- Well, like you said, dynamite with numbers.
- Ah.
- Judy, have fun.
I'll be counting the days till you get back.
- What are you talking about?
I haven't even left yet.
- All righty then.
Ready?
Have her back before you know it.
- Excuse me, we're looking for Reina alfaro.
- Reina alfaro.
Think she called in sick today.
- Her landlord saw her leave for work.
- I don't know what to tell you.
She never signed in.
- Reina, it's Marshall.
Where are you?
- In the basement.
- Okay, sit tight.
Is there any other way in?
- There's an entrance through the back, in the alley.
Hurry!
- Reina.
- Stan, a threat-assessment ruse
Is only gonna buy us a few days, tops.
- Well, we claim we don't know
Who was tracking Reina at the clinic.
We didn't get a good look at the guys.
The witness is in danger,
We're simply following WITSEC protocol.
- I would say we're on a fine line between honesty
And a profound breach,
But we crossed that line a mile back.
- I don't know what Suarez wants or why.
Until we figure it out, we do our job,
We keep her safe.
Hey, Reina, come on.
We got you a room, okay?
Can I help you with that?
What's the matter?
You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.
None of this is okay.
- Reina, easy.
We're here to help you.
- I did what I was asked, didn't I?
I was asked to testify.
I did.
I was asked to be patient.
I was.
I love this country,
I love my home.
I just want to be safe in it, that's all.
Is that so much?
- No, of course not.
- I'm asked and asked and asked,
And the more I say yes, the more I get in trouble!
- Things are a little crazy right now.
- No, you think I'm a victim.
Ice thinks I'm a criminal.
You know what I am?
I am a nurse.
That's all I ever wanted to do is help people,
And that's what gets me in trouble.
- Reina, what are you talking about?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
I'm just...
- This is a bureaucratic mix-up, that's all.
We'll sort it out.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm just tired.
- It's fine.
It'll all be fine.
We'll get you checked in,
You'll be trying to wrestle the TV remote from me
Inside of ten minutes.
- Okay, Judy.
You wait in here.
Inspector.
Call you when I'm ready for her.
- Will Larry be there?
- Yes.
Yes, he'll be sitting at the defense table
When you're on the witness stand, but...
He can't come near you,
And we'll be with you the whole time.
- I haven't seen Larry in six months,
Three weeks, and five days.
- Right.
And you know that once you testify, that'll be it.
You'll go back to Albuquerque
And never lay eyes on Larry again.
- He's not dying.
He's just going to jail.
People in jail get visitors all the time.
I've seen it, in movies.
- No, I know.
I'm not saying...
Look, Judy, the thing is,
You won't be able to visit him.
That's one of the rules.
- Maybe I can see him when he gets out.
- No, you'll have a new life.
That means no more Larry, ever.
- But he's my friend.
- No, he's not your...
Look, I don't think...
After today, there's a good chance
That Larry won't want to be your friend.
Let's just take it one step at a time, okay?
All you have to do today
Is answer the a.U.S.A.'s questions honestly.
That's it.
- How else would I answer them?
- No other way, Judy.
This part you've got down pat.
- You look funny in that shirt.
It looks weird on you.
- Like I said,
Down pat.
- Miss Wagrowksi,
The number would come in how?
- It was the last three digits
Of that day's purse at the track.
- So if the jackpot at the racetrack was 3,943.56...
- Then that day's number was 3-5-6.
Anyone who picked 3-5-6 as their number would win.
My job was to keep track of how much money had come in,
How much we were paying to the winners,
And how much was left.
- And where did you keep track of all that?
- In my head.
- Thank you, miss wagrowski.
No more questions.
- Let's recess for the day.
Court is adjourned.
- Hi, Larry.
- Judy, let's go.
- It's me, Judy.
Larry!
- Judy.
- Why didn't he wave ck to me?
- What?
- I waved at him, and he didn't wave back.
- Judy, I know this has gotta be confusing.
- I answered all the lawyer's questions.
What else was I supposed to do?
- Not a thing.
You did your job,
And you did it really, really well.
- I told the truth,
And he won't wave at me, won't say hello,
Like he doesn't even know me.
- Judy.
- And you want me to lie.
You want me to say my name isn't my name
And my job isn't my job and my friend isn't my friend.
- Whoa.
Jesus, Judy, just take a take a breath.
- All I wanted when I was little was a friend,
Just one.
They'd come over to my house,
And they'd want to leave as soon as they got there.
And then I met Larry,
And I finally had a friend,
And he never thought I was weird.
And now he's gone.
I just lost my only friend.
- No, look.
- Now I'm gonna be alone
For the rest of my life.
- Okay, Judy.
- Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!
I don't like it, I don't like being touched.
- Okay, okay.
Judy, it's okay.
Look, just give us a little space?
- You're too close to me.
- Okay, I'm backing up, okay?
Look, I know it's hard,
The thought of losing your only friend,
But Larry was not your friend.
- Yes, he was.
Larry was my best friend.
- Okay, maybe he was,
But he took advantage of your abilities
To make money illegally.
He used you.
- I'm not doing this.
I don't want to testify anymore.
- Judy, you can't do that, okay?
You'll be kicked out of WITSEC.
You could be charged with a crime.
- I don't care.
I'm not lying anymore,
And I'm not hurting Larry.
- Look...
- leave me alone.
- Judy.
- Go!
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
I don't want to talk to you anymore!
- Okay.
Okay.
You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.
Let's just take a breath together, okay?
You and me.
- "a breath together" doesn't even make sense.
- Be right back, Judy.
Why don't you and the team take her back to the hotel, okay?
Get her secure.
Gotta find the a.U.S.A. And make sure he's got a heads-up.
- No problem.
- Judy.
Judy!
Inspector Lancaster's gonna take you back to the hotel, okay?
We can talk about tomorrow's testimony later.
- No.
No more testimony.
- She was fine a half an hour ago.
I mean, totally comped, a dream on the stand.
- Well, apparently alienating the only person
That ever mattered to her was more than she could take.
- How do you think she'll take it
When I charge her with accessory?
- She doesn't respond well to threats.
She responds to fairness and honesty.
She needs to be convinced that taking the stand
Equals doing what's right.
- I thought she understood that.
- She does.
She will.
It's just,
For her the world is...
Hang on.
What?
- She's gone.
- What?
Lancaster, tell me you're not talking about my witness.
- We were stopped at a street light,
She started saying, "coffee, two sugars,
Coffee, two sugars," over and over.
I saw a coffee shop, and we pulled over.
Thought maybe it would calm her down.
She bolted.
- You get paid for this, right?
I could get a guy off the street
If all I needed was someone to not keep track of witnesses.
Christ.
Keep looking.
Rry's home address, I need it.
- Wait a minute, what's happening?
- They lost Judy.
- Oh, no!
No!
No!
- Hey, how 'bout you be the only one around me
Not having a tizzy?
Could you do that?
Get me the goddamn address.
Come on.
- I just got off the phone with the deputy director.
He's either having a very bad day,
Or he's trying out some very creative new curse words.
- So he's not buying the threat assessment?
- I may have to cut Reina loose.
What do you got?
- Maybe nothing.
Kinda hope not, actually.
Those break-ins at the clinics.
- Yeah?
- I'm a little worried Reina's mixed up in this.
- Well, doesn't sound like her.
- I didn't think so, either.
But there was that thing she said,
Something about how helping people got her into trouble?
- And?
- All three clinics reported
Missing drugs and other items,
But not your typical recreational
Oxycontin and pain-killers.
We're talking penicillin,
Infant flu vaccine,
Blankets, diapers.
And the day before Reina calls me...
- Son of a bitch.
All right, you take Reina.
I got Suarez.
- Reina, I have a theory I'd like to run past you.
Someone comes to you and says
That there are babies in need of basic medical care,
But their parents are illegals
And too scared to bring them in, even to a clinic.
So you and some other Florence nightingales,
Along with doctors and orderlies,
Are asked to make a few supplies...
Disappear.
Am I close?
So ice starts connecting the dots,
Tracing vaccines and you to one of the breached clinics,
Figuring an inside job.
Next thing you know,
Suarez shows up at your door
With his bravado and his badge.
Then what?
- He saw that my visa was about to expire,
And he said that he could help me
If I became his informant,
Reporting illegals.
But there was no way.
I didn't say no or yes,
And I couldn't tell you,
Because I knew I had committed a crime,
And I would have been kicked out.
I was only trying to help.
- Judy, what are you doing here?
- I want to talk to you.
I brought you coffee, two sugars.
Two sugars.
Sorry it's after 5:00.
- Where are your marshals?
- I came to see you, to explain.
- I trusted you.
I gave you a job when nobody would.
I'm your friend, Judy.
- I know.
- Then why are you hurting me?
That's not what friends do.
- I'm sorry!
I'm really sorry, Larry.
What do I do?
- Stop.
Just stop talking, stop hurting me.
Be my friend.
Look, you gotta go.
You shouldn't be here.
I'm out on bail.
Just go.
Go!
- Was that the friggin' retard?
- Don't call her that.
That girl is smarter than you, me, and 90% of the city.
- Larry, think.
If that was her and she's on her own,
We got a window.
- What are you saying?
I'm saying we got an open window here.
You know everything about her,
She knows everything about you.
Where's she going, Larry?
That's all you need to tell me.
You don't need to know anything else.
Tell me, Larry,
And it just happens.
Nature takin' its course.
You don't do a thing.
And then, like that,
We're out from under all of this.
- U.S. Marshals.
Where the hell is Judy?
- She's not with you?
- I swear to God, I've got a rainy day fund
For when I get suspended without pay,
And I am this close to dipping into it.
Where's Judy?
Coffee, two sugars.
She's a little late today.
What the hell did you do to her?
- Nothin'.
I swear, nothing.
- Larry, Judy cares about you.
Look, she risked her life to come here
To talk to you, to try to explain something
She doesn't even understand.
To make things right.
So if you know where she is,
Do the right thing.
Be a friend.
Every day after work, she'd go to highland park
And get a hot dog with Sauerkraut
And sit on a bench.
- We're moving.
- Okay, three that way,
Two that way.
Weapon!
- Drop the knife!
drop it!
Get an a.P.B. Out on the goddamn car!
- Here's the thing, Jack.
All right?
No flexing, no threats,
No going to your boss or mine,
Just you and me, talking off the rec, all right?
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.
Reina made a mistake.
- She committed a crime.
- All right, all right.
- I offered her a chance to clean that up.
- To be fair, you tried to leverage her
Into being an informant
Because she was scared, all right?
Now, you didn't step outside the lines,
But from where you're sitting,
Reina's just another name on a pile of illegals,
All right?
Let me tell you something, Jack.
Reina's a hero, all right?
She is here because she's a patriot.
- Yeah?
How's that?
- Uh, I can't tell you.
Okay?
But if I could, I would tell you
That when she had the choice to hide or tell the truth,
This woman stood up.
She risked her life for a country
That wasn't even hers yet.
Don't tell me she blew it
Funneling surplus flu vaccine to a kid with a cold.
Don't tell me that.
Jack...
This is in your hands.
Do this thing for me.
Whatever it is down the line, I owe you.
- Witness is secure.
- Not yet, she's not.
Is that your chief?
- Yeah.
- Tell him he's got a long report headed his way,
Your name all over it.
Let's go, Judy.
- Who was that man?
- God.
- How'd you know where I was?
- Come on.
- Where are we going?
- Back to the hotel.
I don't care if you watch TV, order room service,
Or stand on your head.
Tomorrow, though, you're going to court.
- But, Mary, I...
- If you don't want to testify, don't, fine.
But there are consequences.
- What kind of consequences?
- You'll be arrested, Judy!
You'll be arrested.
Jesus!
I get that you're not good with people,
And I get that you only have one friend
And that lying makes you stressed.
I get you don't like to be touched, forget being hugged.
I'm not wild about handshakes.
In a lot of ways, I'm like you, Judy.
You minus the math skills.
And I've been trying, best I can,
To keep myself in check, to not be so...
Me.
And you know what?
You ran off anyway.
Because you don't need soft-spoken condescension
And... and taking breaths.
I sure as hell don't.
What we need is the truth, both of us,
Unvarnished and sugar-free,
And, frankly, that's all I've got left.
- That's called monologuing, what you just did.
I do it all the time.
- Judy,
You promised to testify.
Look, you said lying is hard for you,
"stressful," right?
Breaking a promise, that's...
- The same thing as lying.
- Exactly.
Did you ever promise you wouldn't testify against Larry?
- No.
We only talked about numbers,
Baseball, and the Pittsburgh steelers.
- And you understand that what he was doing,
What you were helping him do, was illegal.
That you were breaking the law,
And the law is...
- A promise.
I know that.
- I need you to trust me.
I know it's not easy.
It's a gamble.
Everything is.
I think you should gamble on me.
Okay, I might not be the best person,
But I'm a good bet.
My job is to keep you safe.
If you don't go to court tomorrow and tell what you know,
You will not be safe,
And that's a promise, too.
- You smell bad.
- Can you identify Lawrence silvers?
Please note for the record
The witness has identified the defendant, Lawrence silvers.
And what was the nature of your relationship?
- He said he was my friend.
I don't know if that was true or not.
But he was my employer.
That's true.
That I can prove.
- Hey, Howard, how you doin'?
- Ohh, tough week.
How was your trip?
- Good.
It was good.
It was a good week.
What can I do to help?
- It's just a mess.
I can't find Mrs. Anderson's I.R.A. Information.
Now she wants to make a deposit.
- Remember you asked me to transfer
Mrs. Anderson's assets to the short-term Cd?
I've been keeping track from the road.
She's up at 31/2%.
Tell her. 31/2%.
- Judy, you're a godsend.
- Would you like some coffee?
Two sugars, right?
- I'd love some.
Uh, a lot of milk, though.
Uh, mostly milk.
Mrs. Anderson, yeah, I have it right here.
It looks like you're up 31/2.
Uh-huh.
- Would you like some coffee, Mary?
- Empanadas.
- My mother's recipe.
I just wanted to thank you
For everything you did to help me.
- We were just doing our job, Reina.
- And you're sure that my temporary green card
Is not going to expire?
- Agent Suarez and I have reached
An interagency understanding.
- Muchas gracias...
To both of you.
Okay, enjoy.
Ciao.
- Ciao.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Holy mother, what is that smell?
- Homemade empanadas.
- What kind?
- Mine, that's what kind.
- How come you get the witnesses who cook you food,
And I get the ones who can multiply
Very large numbers in their head?
- It is commonly referred to as karma.
- Tu empanadas es mi empanadas.
- Actually, it would be, "tus empanadas son mis empanadas."
- So, in High School,
Who didn't hate you?
- Actually, I was both well-liked
And widely admired.
How's Judy?
- Adjusting to change.
- Hey.
Who isn't?
- One, two, three.
- Okay, that meeting was intense.
That one guy...
I mean, how do you lose ten dry-cleaning businesses
In one poker game?
- How?
- Listen, Brandi,
I, uh...
I might need that 10 grand back.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
You know, my business it's cash out, cash in.
I've just had a brutal run the last couple days.
But I will get it back, I swear.
- But I need that money to start my business.
- I know that,
And you're gonna get it back with a big profit,
Just like last time.
But the thing is, I...
You know, I kinda need it soon.
- Like, how soon?
- Hey.
- Mary, what are you doing here?
- Well...
Look, this isn't my thing, you know.
It's probably never gonna be.
I mean, if you want to sit in a circle and talk to me,
It's gotta be at a table
With rib-eyes and a bottle of scotch.
I'm buying.
- Well, now, that sounds good.
I'm up for that.
- Squish, rib-eyes, this way.
Chop chop.
You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Let's go.
- What I told Judy that day on the hill was true.
Trusting anything...
your family, your instincts,
The dim-witted anchor on the 10:00 news...
It's all a gamble,
With plenty of promises and no guarantees.
But I'm finding the longer I live,
No matter how often I fall on my face,
That folding's for losers, that winners take hits.
Call it going all-in, call it rolling the dice.
Screw hedging your bets.
Bluff, raise, call, stand, again and again.
There are two kinds of folks who sit around thinking about how to kill people psychopaths and mystery writers.
I'm the kind that pays better.
Who am I?
- I'm Rick Castle.
Castle.
Castle.
I really am ruggedly handsome, aren't I?
Every writer needs inspiration, and I've found mine.
I'm Detective Kate Beckett.
Beckett.
- Beckett?
- Could you get some backup, please?
And thanks to my friendship with the mayor,
- I get to be on her case.
- Oh!
Do I look like a killer to you?
Yes, you kill my patience.
And together, we catch killers.
- I hate this case.
- I know.
Isn't it great?
Whoa!
Oh, dude.
Oh!
Dude.
Dude.
Aw.
Science project?
No, it's a pet.
Say hello to Theodore, dad.
I'm rat-sitting him for Ashley.
Hello, Theodore.
How goes the rat race?
Did you know the average life span of a rat is two to three years?
Ashley's had Theodore for five.
And this is the first time he's left him with anyone.
Trusting you with a treasured pet...
That's a big step in a relationship.
Yeah, I guess it kind of is.
I must say, the little plague pusher is not very diligent about his exercise.
I don't know.
I-I think it's just those beady little eyes.
It's a rat, mother.
They all have beady eyes.
That's where the phrase comes from.
Mm.
Dad, those are for Theodore.
He has a very specific diet
I'm supposed to follow.
Well, unless he's Ben,
I'm sure he won't hold it against me.
If anyone needs me, I'll be in the park with a dead body.
Ah.
Who's Ben?
Killer rat movie.
Before your time.
You know, I understand ferrets as a pet...
Snakes, spiders, even a hairless mole.
But a rat?
Probably kids in this city who keep cockroaches as pets.
You're probably right.
What's the strangest pet you've ever had?
You.
Hey, Lanie.
What's this, a hit-and-run?
In a manner of speaking.
Two BMX bikers rode over the body, then called it in.
But the cause of death are the gunshot wounds...
One to the chest, and two more in the back.
So he's wounded on both sides?
Maybe there were two shooters, he was caught in the cross fire?
Won't know till I get him back to the lab.
You got an I.D.?
Leonard Levitt, Ozone Park, Queens.
Wallet, cash, keys- everything still here.
Which means it wasn't theft.
No.
Something much more nefarious.
A feather.
Alternating stripes, uniform color...
This is no ordinary pigeon feather.
This... this is from a bird of prey.
So what are you suggesting, Castle, that a bird shot him three times?
Not just any bird.
This is the calling card of a murderer known only as...
The Falcon killer.
Or maybe before getting shot, he just bent down and picked up the feather.
See, that's why you'll never be a best-selling novelist.
No sense of drama.
I find that dead bodies are usually enough.
Thanks, Lanie.
Mm-hmm.
Yo.
So we ran background on your vic.
It's pretty thin.
He was a New York city transit employee.
Worked in the subway out of the 116th street station.
He worked uptown and he lived in Queens?
Then what was he doing in the park?
That's pretty out of the way.
Well, we thought that he was looking to buy some weed or some love, but he has no drug history, no convictions of solicitations, no nothing.
And what about his family?
Both parents are deceased.
Guy never married, has no children.
It's like he barely existed.
Making him the perfect victim.
Mild-mannered city employee lured into a conveniently wooded area, struck down by a murderer with the speed and cunning of a bird of prey.
Don't ask.
You guys go to his apartment.
Find out who he is and what he was doing in the park.
Right.
Lividity and temperature puts time of death between 5:00 and 7:00 P.M.
The victim also has a broken wrist.
Could be postmortem from those BMX-ers playing X games on his corpse.
What about the gunshot wounds?
Al three entry wounds were made by the same weapon...
A .45.
There was only one shooter.
So the same person shot him in the front, and then shot him in the back?
Didn't make any sense to me either, so I decided to take some measurements.
Turns out, the wounds are of different depths.
The one on his chest is very shallow, indicating the shot came from a distance.
How far?
About 150 feet.
That's quite an accurate shot with a handgun.
Mm.
Yeah, I'd say your killer had some shooting experience.
But the next two shots in the back were close range, inside 6 feet, maybe.
So he got shot in the chest at long range, turned around to run...
But he's wounded.
The killer goes after him to finish what he started with a double tap to the back.
He wasn't just shot.
He was hunted down and killed.
But why?
Whoa.
What was this guy up to?
No idea.
What about that?
Looks like some sort of counter.
What do you think he was counting?
Nothing good.
Night vision, spotting scope, parabolic microphone...
Top quality, too.
What's a subway worker doing with all this?
I don't know.
But whatever he was into, it had something to do with the park.
Look.
This is right where his body was found.
5:26...
That's around our time of death.
Looks like he was tracking something or someone with the initials B.H.S.
And it looks like that someone found him.
Surveillance equipment, clandestine meetings, a professional hit...
Mix in the subway, and we're looking at
"The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3," or better yet, "Money Train."
Any one of these people could be a secret accomplice.
That's what I love about the subway.
Down here, everyone's got a story.
See, that's the difference between you and me, Castle.
You see the subway as a place to pick up dialogue for your novels.
Or the occasional investment banker on her way to the gym.
I, on the other hand, see it as a way of getting from point "A" to point "B."
So Lightbulb Len's dead, huh?
Lightbulb Len?
Yeah, it was his job to change the lightbulbs in the stations and tunnels all over New York.
I figured something was wrong.
It's the first time he's missed work in 22 years.
Mr. Rivera, Len was found shot to death in the park.
Any idea what he was doing there?
The guy changed lightbulbs for a living.
You know, a job like that, it's not for the social.
I mean, in the 12 years I was his supervisor,
I don't think we ever had one personal conversation.
But you know who you should talk to?
Who?
Mr. Sansone?
Arthur!
I'm sorry.
It's just...
Why would anybody want to shoot him?
Well, we were hoping that you could tell us that.
Well, the guy was one of the unsung heroes of this city.
He saved a lot of lives.
I'm sorry.
I thought...
I thought he changed lightbulbs.
Bad things happen in darkness, Mr. Castle, dimly lit tunnels, darkened stairwells.
If Len heard about a blown bulb before shift end, he would stay late, on his own time, to fix it.
And of course, there was his response to the Abe Lipschitz tragedy.
1989...
An electrocution of a bulb changer at the Brighton Beach station.
This is a circuit interrupter switch.
Shuts down all of the power inside a tunnel so that electrical maintenance could be performed safely.
Down here...
It's called the Lenny Box...
Because it took a visionary like Len Levitt to design it and force the transit authority to install one in every station in this city.
What about high-tech gear?
Did Lenny ever use any night vision or microphones for his work?
No.
Why?
How about the initials B.H.S.?
Does that mean anything to you?
Maybe someone or something that Len was keeping tabs on.
The only thing Len Levitt ever kept tabs on was every single bulb he ever changed.
Did he have any enemies that you know of?
You don't make waves without making a few enemies.
Because of Len, we're in the middle of a systemwide changeover from incandescent to compact fluorescents.
New technology comes in, the city ends up with a warehouse full of old bulbs.
That makes some guy in a suit at the old bulb factory very unhappy.
You ask me, corporations conspired to take Lenny out.
"'Lenny Box.
'" So the guy's an inventor?
Apparently he was an underground renaissance man.
Guess that explains all the electronics.
And the counter in his apartment...
All the lightbulbs he changed.
Seriously, this guy changed over a million lightbulbs?
The man was an unsung hero, all right?
Cut down by the forces of Big Bulb.
Big Bulb?
The filament-industrial complex.
Lenny's buddy is delusional if he actually thinks that Lenny was killed by a lightbulb conspiracy.
Well, I wouldn't dismiss our subterranean friend just yet.
I was running through Len's phone records, and one jumped out.
The outgoing call to the New York city employee tip line?
It's where you call to rat out your coworkers.
Must "rat" always be used in the pejorative?
In the Chinese zodiac, the rat is ac...
What was the tip?
Well, all those incandescent bulbs they were replacing?
Levitt claims that he had evidence his supervisor was stealing them and then reselling them on the black market.
You mean Mario Rivera?
The same.
The charges pan out, the guy could lose his job and his pension.
Oh, and get this, before he was in the transit authority,
Mario was in the marine corps for eight years where he won a weapons medal for sharpshooting.
Where were you last night between 5:00 and 7:00 P.M.?
Working.
We checked.
You clocked out at 4:34.
You, uh, hop the B or the D down to 59th street.
The express only takes, what, ten minutes?
Plenty of time to get to the park, kill Len.
Why would I kill Len?
Because he filed a report against you with the transit authority when he found out about Costa Rica.
What the hell are you guys talking about?
These are e-mails that were sent from you to your contact in Costa Rica.
These are my private e-mails.
Sent from a workplace computer, which means we can look.
So I was thinking about taking a vacation down there.
Yeah, drink a few cervezas, maybe go parasailing on the beach, sell some lightbulbs to some locals.
The city has a warehouse full of old, incandescent lightbulbs that you figured no one would miss, so you sold them to a wholesaler in Costa Rica for 20 cents a pop.
That's 100 grand.
Only someone did miss them.
Someone with the word "lightbulb" in his name.
When you found out Len was on to you, you realized you could lose your job and your pension.
You couldn't afford to let him go to the transit authority with what he knew.
I didn't kill nobody.
Well, then why don't you just come clean with what you did last night between 5:00 and 7:00?
The thing about murderers, Mario, is they tend to not have solid alibis.
Generally because they're murdering somebody.
Look...
Those old lightbulbs were just gonna get destroyed and end up in a landfill.
I was doing the city a favor.
So I make a little extra.
So who gets hurt?
Uh...
I'm gonna go with Len.
Last chance, Mario.
After work, I went up to the grand concourse to pack up a shipment of lightbulbs.
They went out to Costa Rica last night.
You can check.
I was there.
Thanks.
He's telling the truth.
Len's call to the tip line?
Turns out that the transit cops had him under surveillance all last week.
His tail has him in the Bronx last night just like he said.
Call the transit cops and tell them that we just closed their case for them.
Right.
So if lightbulbs didn't get Lenny killed, then what did?
You know, it can't be a coincidence that he was killed right there at about the same time that he has written down.
And what does "B.H.S." stand for?
Bronx high school?
Hmm.
Big honkin' stereo?
Boys have shoes?
Try Byron H. Singer.
I found a small vendor decal on the side of the parabolic microphone we found in his apartment, so I called the vendor to find out if he knew why Len bought the equipment.
Turns out, Len didn't buy it at all.
It was purchased two months ago by an insurance actuary named Byron H. Singer.
B.H.S.!
Sorry.
Mr. Singer, thank you for coming down.
They said it was important.
Do you know a man named Len Levitt?
What did that bastard tell you?
He didn't tell us anything.
Good, because he's a liar.
He thought he knew better than me.
He thought he knew better than everybody.
Mr. Singer...
I don't care if he didn't believe me.
I don't care how much it hurt him.
I know what I saw.
And what did you see?
The two of them, together, in the park, like a pair of lovebirds.
But he accused me of making the whole thing up.
I mean, why would I make something like that up?
Why would anybody?
Mr. Singer, what exactly did you see in the park?
I saw enough.
And believe me, I was pretty shocked to see them together.
I knew I had to tell Len before somebody else did.
Len must have been very angry when you told him.
Very angry and jealous, but I had followed them and found their secret spot.
And I told him where and when to find them.
I even lent him some of my equipment so he could spy on them himself.
So Len goes to the park, and he sees for himself.
And then he confronts them in a jealous rage, and they kill him.
They do what now?
Er.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Uh... who did you see in the park that night?
The red-tailed hawks.
Oh.
There haven't been a nesting pair in the park for 40 years.
You mean, this is about birds?
Not just birds.
The red-tailed hawks.
Len oversees the log in the central park boathouse, where all the sightings are officially recorded.
But he refused to acknowledge my sighting.
So I told him, if he didn't believe me, he should go out to the park and see for himself.
They nest at dusk.
Mr. Singer, were you in the park yesterday between 5:00 and 7:00 P.M.?
Usually I am, but yesterday I was in my office, working.
And can any of your colleagues verify that?
I'm sure they can, but about the hawks...
And I want this on the official record...
I would never exaggerate or fabricate a bird sighting.
It's unthinkable.
They're there, and I saw them first.
I'm putting that in the official record.
So the equipment, the park, the feather, and B.H.S....
It looks like we've explained everything.
Yes, except why he was killed.
Morning, mother.
Morning.
So why is gram on the table and why are you on the floor?
Dad, he's gone.
Theodore?
When I fed him his quinoa salad with wheat berries,
I must not have closed the cage door all the way, and now he's gone, and Ashley's going to hate me.
Oh, he's not gonna hate you.
He'll understand.
No, he won't.
He trusted me, and I let him down.
No, not yet, you haven't.
We'll find him.
Have you looked in your room?
And in gram's, too.
If that creature entered my room,
I'm gonna need a new bed...
And wardrobe.
Dad, what if he got out?
Like "out" out?
All right, Theodore is an uptown rat.
He's here someplace.
Okay, to find a rodent, you have to think like a rodent.
You are Theodore.
What do you want?
Food.
Eh, you got a personal chef.
You're not hungry.
Warmth.
I'd want to stay warm and safe.
Yeah, a cozy, quiet place, out of the way, where no one's gonna step on you.
Front hall closet.
Nice.
You see him?
No.
He's not here.
He's not here.
What?
You need to go.
And leave you ratless?
It's my responsibility, dad.
Not yours.
I'll find him.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
All right.
You call me...
If you need anything.
Just so you know, I'm checking into the Plaza, and you're paying.
Okay, Castle, I'm here.
What was so important?
Your first clue is...
The curious incident of the dog in the nighttime.
Oh, jeez, Castle.
I haven't even had my coffee yet.
Thank you.
From the Sherlock Holmes story, "Silver Blaze."
Holmes unmasks the murderer because of what didn't happen.
The dog didn't bark.
That's how he knew the dog must have known the killer.
Okay.
Yes, I remember the story.
Then you know that the hardest form of detection is looking for the thing that isn't there.
Byron said that Len was going to verify the hawks.
Verify, as in "provide proof," which means...
He would've had a camera...
Which we didn't find.
And if he was taking pictures...
We should be able to figure out what he was up to.
We found the body here, where he took the last two bullets...
Running away from his killer.
He had a broken wrist.
From the BMX guys riding over his body.
Or he fell from a tree.
This tree.
There's a fresh divot.
It's all birds.
Mm.
Red-tailed hawks.
Looks like Byron Singer was telling the truth after all.
Yeah, remind me to notify the bird police.
But I doubt it was the hawks that killed him.
Whoa.
Lightbulb Len witnessed a child abduction.
And the last thing he saw was his killer.
We don't know his name or age, but we're estimating between 10 and 12 years old.
He has brown hair, hazel eyes, and was last seen wearing shorts, sneakers, and a gray and white jacket.
Now our kidnapper is male, brown hair, between 5'10" and 6".
He was carrying a Glock .45, which matches the size of the slugs that we found in our victim's body.
Now both photos have time stamps on them, so we know that the abduction took place at 5:12 P.M. on Tuesday.
After 48 hours, the chances of finding a child abduction victim alive go way down.
The only thing that matters is finding that kid.
If he's been missing for 36 hours, how come his parents haven't reported it?
They might not know.
Or they might be under duress.
He was wearing shorts, which probably means he knew he was going to the park.
Well, if he wasn't lured there, maybe he knew his kidnapper.
But then why would the kidnapper need a gun?
I e-mailed the photo to the New York State Police and the parole division.
They're looking into any kidnappers with this abduction M.O.
And Esposito is canvassing that part of the park looking for any witnesses.
Well, what about schools?
If the boy goes to a local school, they'd know he was absent.
Have uniforms fax his photo to all schools in the five boroughs.
Done.
That car looks to be, like, a compact or a subcompact.
Can we get the make or model?
Lab's already looking into it.
We're pulling video from all traffic cameras on the streets leading in and out of the park on Tuesday evening.
Maybe we'll catch a license plate.
Or the driver's face.
What if we were to enlarge this part of the photo...
Not the face, just this part of the window?
Are you thinking of the reflection?
I'm wondering if maybe we can see the kidnapper's face in that side view mirror.
It's worth a shot.
I need a C.S.U. photo tech up here now.
You sure you haven't seen him?
Man, I see so many kids every day,
I couldn't tell one from the next.
What about a blue car around the same time, somewhere in this area?
Tuesday about 5:00?
Yeah.
Yeah, as a matter of fact, a blue Saturn.
You sure?
Yeah.
People I forget.
Things that get in my way, I remember.
It was parked right in front of my regular spot.
Instead, I gotta set up at the edge of the roadway.
I almost get clipped by a cab.
Anybody inside?
No, because I woulda yelled at the driver if there was.
I don't know what's wrong with people in this city.
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah.
Our pretzel vendor I.D.'ed the kidnapper's car as a blue Saturn sedan, anywhere from '97 to '02.
The problem is, there are 6,000 blue Saturns registered in the tristate area alone.
Ryan, where are we on the traffic cams?
The make and model will help narrow it down, but there's a lot of footage.
There's also no central database for school absences.
We can't sort by grade or gender, and there's a bad cold making the rounds, so more kids are out than usual.
What about state police?
Whole lot of nada, and nothing popped on parolees with the same kidnapping M.O.
Yes, I'll continue to hold.
Detective, enhanced and enlarged.
Thank you.
Oh, the enhancement only increased the pixilation on all these.
You can't even see there's a side view mirror.
Well, it's not like on "24", Castle.
In the real world, zoom and enhance can only get us so far.
Yeah, but you can't even...
There's no reflection.
It's just mush.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
No.
God, this kid isn't that much younger than Alexis.
Don't worry.
We'll find him.
Alexis.
What?
I've seen this before.
You've seen what?
This mark on his sock.
Alexis used to get these when she played soccer.
They're cleat marks from where other kids kick her in the shin.
If he was playing soccer in the park, he might be a part of an organized team or a league.
And youth leagues have web sites that you can go to.
The parents and kids can track scores and standings.
I spoke to the league commissioner, and only one 10- to 12-year-old team practiced on Tuesday...
The Wildcats.
There!
Tyler Donegal.
He's 12.
Ryan, let's get everything we can on this kid.
The clock is ticking, and we gotta bring him back alive.
Tyler Donegal lives with his mother in Westchester.
Court records show that the parents' divorce was finalized two months ago.
You reach the parents?
Just got off with the mother- Mirielle Lefcourt.
She moved out of the city last year.
Got remarried to an anesthesiologist last month.
She says she has no idea that her son is missing.
He was spending two days in the city with her ex.
She's on her way in now.
If the father had custody, where the hell is he, and why didn't he report the boy missing?
We're working on that, sir.
The father's a maintenance supervisor at High-Rise on West Broadway and Canal.
He lives six blocks from Central Park.
Yo.
Donegal called in sick for work yesterday and today.
Divorced parents, one child, one spouse remarries quickly?
So she dumps the janitor in the city for the doctor in the burbs.
All the father has left is his son.
It's got all the hallmarks of a custodial abduction.
You got a photo?
I'll get one.
Dean Donegal.
5'10", 175...
Brown hair.
Well, the vitals match.
Yeah.
Yeah, but why do you need a gun to kidnap your own son?
You just put him in the car, tell him you're going for ice cream.
What's he doing?
Hey, Beckett, the mother's here.
All right, Ryan, you go to Dean's office.
Esposito, you check out his apartment.
Maybe something else is going on with that family.
Right.
Where's my son?
That's what we're trying to determine, Mrs. Lefcourt.
When was the last time that you spoke with him?
Uh, two days ago when I dropped him off at his father's.
He was supposed to be with Dean.
Have you talked to Dean?
We're trying to locate him now.
He's not at work?
He never misses work.
Can you tell me about the divorce?
How did Dean take that?
Um, not well.
He was very bitter and angry.
Does he own a gun?
A handgun.
Yes.
There were break-ins in his building.
Do you know what kind?
Why are you asking me about a-a gun?
Was somebody shot?
Was my son shot?
No, nobody was shot, Mrs. Lefcourt.
It's just, the man who took your son was carrying a gun.
Now I'm gonna have to show you this photograph.
Do you recognize this man?
I don't know.
Is that Dean?
I was hoping that you could tell me.
What about this car?
Is that his car?
No, Dean doesn't own a car.
He... he rents one as he needs one.
A Glock.
Dean's gun, it's a Glock.
We had to itemize our property for the divorce.
Mrs. Lefcourt, does Dean have a place that he likes to take Tyler?
Any, um, favorite hangouts?
No, as far as I know, he's never taken him anywhere.
That's not true.
Dean's family has a cabin in the Poconos.
Pennsylvania state police are on their way to the cabin.
With any luck, we'll find Tyler.
You okay?
I can't imagine how Tyler's mother feels.
Yeah, me neither.
When Alexis was 4, we went Christmas shopping at some mall in... in White Plains.
I was trying on some charcoal fedora.
I turn around, she is gone, vanished.
I looked everywhere, so did mall security, so did the police.
We searched for an hour.
You don't have to be a novelist to think of all the worst-case scenarios.
Where'd you find her?
Behind a rack of winter coats.
She got bored.
She crawled underneath there and went to sleep.
To this day, I still dream about that.
Just got off with Esposito.
Looks like Dean's on the move.
What did they find?
It's what they didn't find...
No toothbrush, no deodorant, no shampoo in the shower.
I'll run his credit card for anything that indicates he's traveling.
Dean's desk?
You can't miss it, right?
Pictures everywhere.
He calls it Tyler-Palooza.
Is this his only work area?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
How'd he sound when he called in sick?
Did he sound... stressed?
Tell you the truth, Detective, Dean didn't call in sick.
I covered for him.
Why?
His ex-wife got remarried to some rich doctor like five minutes after the divorce was final.
He had legal bills up the ass.
I figured, he just needed to spend a little time with his son.
So what if he didn't call in sick?
I had his back.
That's how we do it down here.
Hey, Teresa!
All right, already.
Whoa.
What's in Indy, Dean?
Maybe he's got family in Indianapolis...
Someone who can hide him.
Yeah, but there weren't any airline tickets purchased in his name or in Tyler's.
Yo, the cabin's empty.
P.A. State Troopers say it looks like there hasn't been anybody there in months.
We just got a hit on Dean Donegal's financials.
An hour ago, he booked a motel room in Jamaica, Queens.
That's not far from the airport.
He might still be trying to get Tyler out of town.
If we're lucky.
He shot someone, he's on the run, he's under extreme duress.
Let's get him before this ends bloody for everyone.
NYPD!
Tyler!
Tyler, you here?
!
Hands!
Show me your hands!
Tyler!
Bathroom's clear.
He's not here.
Where's Tyler?
I don't know.
They told me to check into a motel and wait for further instructions.
Who did?
I don't know.
All I know is, they took him.
And if I help you, they'll kill my son.
Where is Tyler, Dean?
I told you, I don't know.
Why were you going to Indianapolis?
Indian...
What are you talking about?
We know you were checking on airfares.
I was researching a trip for the holidays.
What, you think I took my own son?
You were in a hotel by the airport.
That's where they told me to go.
Who?
Please.
They said, if I talk to the cops, he's dead.
Dean, if you're son is in danger, then you need to tell us what you know.
I went to pick him up after practice.
When he wasn't at the usual spot,
I figured he must have walked home.
When I got back to my apartment, that phone was on my doormat.
It had a text on it.
"We have your son.
Tell no one.
Use only this phone."
Contact the police, and Tyler dies."
"Stand by.
We will tell you where to go and what to do.
Tell no one.
Your son's life depends on it."
What do they want from you?
I have no idea.
Dean's Glock is a 9 millimeter.
Right make, wrong model.
Lightbulb Len was killed with a .45.
The SIM card from his cell phone is a burner, and the text messages aren't coming from another phone.
They're coming from an Internet texting service based in the Ukraine- no I.P. Address, untraceable.
Track the SIM.
I want a printout of every text message.
And get the electronic serial number off that phone.
I want to find out where it was purchased and by whom.
You got it, sir.
What do they want from you?
Are they after a ransom?
Are you kidding?
I'm 40 grand in debt after my divorce.
I'm looking up at broke.
What about your ex-wife's new husband?
He has money.
They're not calling him.
They're calling me.
What if they find out I'm here?
I just want my son back.
Then your best option is to work with us.
Let us help you.
I need to get some air.
Look, I know that this is hard.
But you have to trust us.
We will find him.
Okay.
Don't let 'em hurt my boy.
Where is he?
Where is Tyler?
You should've been there to pick him up at soccer practice!
We're doing everything we can.
This is why I should've never agreed to joint custody.
It's gonna be all right.
Stay outta this.
You're not family.
He's my boy, too!
Sit down!
That's enough!
Now I need everyone to calm down, cooperate, and think.
Dean, you notice anyone unusual hanging around your son, anything out of the ordinary going on in his life?
No.
I mean, I...
I don't think so.
What about you two?
Nothing comes to mind.
No.
Now this abduction was clearly planned.
So the kidnapper had to know where Tyler was gonna be.
Sir, this is a message.
It's from the kidnapper.
There's a video attached.
Hi, dad.
I know you're worried, but I'm okay.
They say if you do what they ask, everything will be fine.
Just don't go to the police.
I'll see you soon, and don't forget to feed Ace.
Oh, thank God he's alive.
There's a time stamp on it...
1:31 A.M.
That was sent eight minutes ago.
It's a good thing, Mrs. Lefcourt.
It's called a proof of life video.
The kidnapper sent it to prove your son's alive, and that you do exactly what they ask.
Okay.
You will do exactly what they ask you to.
Do you understand?
Wait.
Play that last part again.
Don't forget to feed Ace.
Who's Ace?
I don't know any Ace.
We don't have any pets.
He's sending us a message.
He's a smart boy.
Uh, Ace could refer to a person or a business.
Sir, there's another text.
"680 Canal Street. 30 minutes."
That's the building where I work.
What's there, a jewelry store, a bank?
No, just offices.
Well, why you?
What's so special about that building that they need you?
Uh...
Oh, God.
Because I have elevator access to all the floors in the building.
You're a human key.
Sir, I just talked to the building's owner.
He's e-mailing blueprints and a tenant list for 680 Canal, including the secure floors.
Ryan and
Esposito are with me.
We'll take Dean to the building.
I've arranged to have an E.S.U. team standing by in striking distance.
Sir, you can't take Dean to that building.
It is way too dangerous.
He's a father who loves his son.
You're not gonna be able to stop him.
And until we find the boy, we don't have any other choice.
Scrub the video.
Look for anything that could lead us to him.
Yes, sir.
All right.
We're a block away.
We'll be able to see and hear everything that's happening, okay?
And we cloned your phone so we'll be able to read your texts in real time.
You follow the kidnapper's instructions to the letter.
No cowboy stuff, you understand me?
Yes.
Hi, dad.
I know you're worried, but I'm okay.
They say if you do what they ask, everything will be fine.
Just don't go to the police.
I'll see you soon, and don't forget to feed Ace.
There are no identifying markers in the background.
It's all black.
I don't know if we're gonna find him in time.
The video was taken at 1:31 A.M.
But they didn't send it till 1:39.
Yeah, well, sometimes it takes a while for a text to go through.
Yeah, but eight minutes?
You want Dean to do something for you.
You make a proof of life video.
But you wait eight minutes to send it.
Why?
Well, maybe there wasn't a signal or not enough bars.
Yeah.
Maybe they had to walk a long way to get a signal.
Maybe they were under a...
Underground.
"Ace.
" It's not "Ace."
It's A-C-E...
The A, C, and E subway lines.
They're holding Tyler in the subway.
He must have spotted a sign.
There's half a dozen stations where the A, C, and E stop.
That's too many to search.
Yeah, but the last stop for all three lines is on Canal Street and West Broadway.
That's...
Right under Dean's building.
They've been holding him under everyone's nose.
Let's go.
Check every room on the east end of the station.
You guys, check ticket booths on both ends.
Go.
Right.
Got it.
Castle, what are you thinking?
The only reason to keep him here is for a quick getaway, which is helped by the fact that 680 Canal Street has its own entrance to the subway.
If it were me...
I'd keep close enough to hook up with my partners but far enough that I would be out of the way.
Which means he's holding Tyler on the west end of the tunnel.
West end of the tunnel?
This room.
All right.
You should stay back.
No chance.
"Go to the 37th floor now."
They said 30 minutes.
It hasn't been 30 minutes yet.
They're changing the timetable in case you went to the cops.
What's on the 37th floor?
Nothing.
It's vacant.
It's not even secure.
Try Beckett.
Nothing.
It's going straight to voice mail.
She must already be in the subway.
I gotta go.
Remember, we can see and hear everything.
Anything goes south, a hundred cops will be on you inside a minute.
Not until you find my son.
Just my luck.
Pulled graveyard tonight.
All right.
He's in.
Not bad with the guard.
Guy's all right.
Camera and mic are all good.
Whoa.
Take us to the 39th floor.
I want to see Tyler first.
Just follow instructions.
You'll see him soon enough.
What's on the 39th floor?
A financial firm...
Breskin Wright.
37 was just a staging area.
They let him see their faces.
As soon as they get what they came for, they're gonna kill him.
Just like Lightbulb Len.
Beckett's still going to voice mail.
Castle, too.
Sir... what do you want to do?
If we go in before we find the kid, we might lose 'em both.
Beckett.
One armed and the kid.
If I go in, he'll kill him before I get a shot off.
He's holding a flashlight.
If we kill the ambient light, he'll light up like a Christmas tree.
We just...
It's like it's meant to be.
Maybe Lenny can prevent another tragedy.
On my count.
Three, two...
One.
Hit P-1.
The subway.
I did what you asked.
Now where's Tyler?
You'll see him in a minute.
Sorry, Dean.
Last stop.
Lobby.
We're supposed to go to subway level.
Why are we stopping at the lobby?
Don't look at me.
No, look at me.
I suggest you drop your weapons.
Where's Tyler?
The ringleader was Robert Kincaid...
Former bond trader.
He's the one who planned the entire operation.
The economy might have collapsed, but he was still gonna get his payday.
Most of them were ex wall streeters.
They knew that they needed a biometric clearance in order to get on secure floors, and they knew that Dean wasn't gonna help them, so they took Tyler as leverage.
But all they took were files.
Financial files, containing unpublished earnings reports.
To a savvy investor, they'd be worth millions.
Would've worked, too, if Lightbulb Len hadn't have been taking pictures in the park.
Mm.
He helped catch his own killer.
And foiled a kidnapping.
It's kind of poetic...
In an unspeakably tragic sort of way.
Mm.
The guy you shot in the subway?
The thug Kincaid hired to do his dirty work.
He just confessed to kidnapping Tyler, murdering Lightbulb Len, and no surprise, he ratted out Kincaid in two seconds flat.
Oh.
Speaking of rats...
I-I gotta...
I gotta go.
I'm the worst person in the whole world.
No, you're not.
You're wonderful, and you're kind, and you're sweet.
I'm a rat killer.
You don't know that.
You may just be a loser.
A-a rat loser.
This did not come out right.
Look...
If he cares, he'll understand.
Yeah, he'll understand, all right.
When he sees me in the halls at school, he'll think, there's the awful girl that lost my best friend.
It's him.
Hi.
Hi.
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
W-what's wrong?
It's about Theodore.
When I fed him, he must have got out of his cage, and...
And he's gone.
He's gone?
We looked everywhere.
I swear.
We've turned this whole place upside down.
How'd he get out?
I must not have locked the cage right.
Ashley, I'm so sorry.
You have every right to hate me.
Come on, Alexis.
I...
I'm...
I'm upset, but I don't hate you.
You don't?
I mean, no, look at this place.
Look at what you did to try to get him back.
Who else would do that?
You cared about him a lot.
Yeah, but...
I care about you more.
There are two kinds of folks who sit around thinking about how to kill people:
psychopaths and mystery writers.
I'm the kind that pays better.
Who am I?
I'm Rick Castle.
Castle.
Castle.
I really am ruggedly handsome, aren't I?
Every writer needs inspiration and I found mine.
I'm Detective Kate Beckett.
Beckett.
Beckett?
Could you get some backup, please?
And thanks to my friendship with the mayor,
I get to be on her case.
Do I look like a killer to you?
Yes, you kill my patience.
And together we catch killers.
I hate this case.
I know.
Isn't it great?
Dude.
Dude?
Dude.
Oh.
Science project?
No, it's a pet.
Say hello to Theodore, Dad.
I'm rat-sitting him for Ashley.
Hello, Theodore.
How goes the rat race?
Did you know the average life span of a rat is two to three years?
Ashley's had Theodore for five and this is the first time he's left him with anyone.
Trusting you with a treasured pet?
That's a big step in a relationship.
Yeah.
I guess it kind of is.
I must say, the little plague-pusher is not very diligent about his exercise.
I don't know why, I think it's just those beady little eyes.
It's a rat, Mother.
They all have beady eyes.
That's where the phrase comes from.
Dad!
Those are for Theodore!
He has a very specific diet I'm supposed to follow.
Well, unless he's Ben, I'm sure he won't hold it against me.
If anyone needs me, I'll be in the park with a dead body.
Bye.
Who's Ben?
Killer rat movie.
Before your time.
You know, I understand ferrets as a pet.
Snakes, spiders, even a hairless mole.
But a rat?
There are probably kids in the city who keep cockroaches as pets.
You're probably right.
Strangest pet you ever had?
You.
Hey, Lanie.
Was this a hit and run?
In a manner of speaking.
Two BMX bikers rode over the body, then called it in.
But the cause of death are the gunshot wounds.
One to the chest, and two more in the back.
So he's wounded on both sides?
Maybe there were two shooters?
He was caught in the crossfire?
Won't know till I get him back to the lab.
Got an ID?
Leonard Levitt, Ozone Park, Queens.
Wallet, cash, keys.
Everything still here.
Which means it wasn't theft.
No.
Something much more nefarious.
A feather.
Alternating stripes, uniform color.
This is no ordinary pigeon feather.
This is from a bird of prey.
So what are you suggesting, Castle?
That a bird shot him three times?
Not just any bird.
This is the calling card of a murderer known only as the Falcon Killer.
Or maybe before getting shot, he just bent down and picked up the feather.
See, that's why you'll never be a best-selling novelist.
No sense of drama.
I find that dead bodies are usually enough.
Thanks, Lanie.
Yo, so we ran background on your vic, but it's pretty thin.
He was a New York City Transit employee, working the subway out of the 116th Street Station.
He worked Uptown and he lived in Queens?
Then what was he doing in the park?
That's pretty out of the way.
Well, we thought that he was looking to buy some weed or some love, but he has no drug history, no convictions for solicitations.
No nothing.
And what about his family?
Both parents are deceased.
Guy never married, has no children.
It's like he barely existed.
Making him the perfect victim.
Mild-mannered city employee lured into a conveniently wooded area.
Struck down by a murderer with the speed and cunning of a bird of prey.
Don't ask.
You guys go to his apartment.
Find out who he is and what he was doing in the park.
Right.
Lividity and temperature puts time of death between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m.
The victim also has a broken wrist.
Could be post-mortem from those BMXers playing X Games on his corpse.
What about the gunshot wounds?
All three entry wounds were made by the same weapon, a.45.
There was only one shooter.
So the same person shot him in the front and then shot him in the back?
It didn't make sense to me either, so I decided to take some measurements.
Turns out the wounds are of different depths.
The one on his chest is very shallow, indicating the shot came from a distance.
- How far?
- About 150 feet.
That's quite an accurate shot with a handgun.
Yeah, I'd say your killer had some shooting experience.
But the next two shots in the back were close range.
Inside six feet, maybe.
So he got shot in the chest at long range.
Turned around to run...
But he's wounded, the killer goes after him to finish what he started with a double tap to the back.
He wasn't just shot.
He was hunted down and killed.
But why?
What was this guy up to?
No idea.
What about that?
Looks like some sort of counter.
What do you think he was counting?
Nothing good.
Night vision, spotting scope, a parabolic microphone.
Top quality, too.
What's a subway worker doing with all this?
I don't know.
Whatever he was into, it had something to do with the park.
Look.
This is right where his body was found.
5:26.
That's around our time of death.
Looks like he was tracking something or someone with the initials BHS.
And it looks like that someone found him.
Surveillance equipment to clandestine meetings, a professional hit.
Mix in the subway, we're looking at The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, or better yet,
Money Train.
Any one of these people could be his secret accomplice.
That's what I love about the subway.
Down here, everyone's got a story.
See, that's the difference between you and me, Castle.
You see the subway as a place to pick up dialogue for your novels.
Or the occasional investment banker on her way to the gym.
I, on the other hand, see it as a way of getting from point A to point B.
So, Light Bulb Len's dead, huh?
Light Bulb Len?
Yeah, it was his job to change the light bulbs in the stations and tunnels all over New York.
I figured something was wrong.
It's the first time he's missed work in 22 years.
Mr. Rivera, Len was found shot to death in the park.
Any idea what he was doing there?
The guy changed light bulbs for a living.
You know, a job like that, it's not for the social.
I mean, in the 12 years I was his supervisor,
I don't think we ever had one personal conversation.
- But you know who you should talk to?
- Who?
Mr. Sansone?
Arthur!
I'm sorry, it's just...
Why would anybody want to shoot him?
Well, we were hoping that you could tell us that.
Well, the guy was one of the unsung heroes of the city.
He saved a lot of lives.
I'm sorry, I thought he changed light bulbs.
Bad things happen in darkness, Mr. Castle.
Dimly lit tunnels, darkened stairwells.
If Len heard about a blown bulb before shift end, he would stay late on his own time to fix it.
And of course, there was his response to the Abe Lipschitz tragedy.
1989?
Electrocution of a bulb changer at the Brighton Beach station?
This is a circuit interrupter switch.
Shuts down all the power inside a tunnel so that electrical maintenance can be performed safely.
Down here it's called the "Lenny box"
because it took a visionary like Len Levitt to design it and force the Transit Authority to install one in every station in this city.
What about high-tech gear?
Did Lenny ever use any night vision or microphones for his work?
No.
Why?
How about the initials BHS?
Does that mean anything to you?
Maybe someone or something that Len was keeping tabs on?
The only thing Len Levitt ever kept tabs on was every single bulb he ever changed.
Did he have any enemies that you know of?
You don't make waves without making a few enemies.
Because of Len, we're in the middle of a system-wide changeover from incandescent to compact fluorescents.
New technology comes in, the city ends up with a warehouse full of old bulbs.
That makes some guy in a suit at the old bulb factory very unhappy.
You ask me, corporations conspired to take Lenny out.
Lenny box.
So the guy's an inventor.
Apparently, he was an underground renaissance man.
Guess that explains all the electronics.
And the counter in his apartment.
All the light bulbs he changed.
Seriously?
This guy changed over a million light bulbs?
The man was an unsung hero, all right?
Cut down by the forces of Big Bulb.
Big Bulb?
The filament-industrial complex.
Lenny's buddy is delusional if he actually thinks that Lenny was killed by a light bulb conspiracy.
I wouldn't dismiss our subterranean friend just yet.
I was running through Len's phone records and one jumped out.
The outgoing call to the New York City employee tip line?
It's where you call to rat out your coworkers.
Must "rat" always be used in the pejorative?
In the Chinese zodiac, the rat...
What was the tip?
All those incandescent bulbs they were replacing?
Levitt claims that he had evidence his supervisor was stealing them and then re-selling them on the black market.
- You mean Mario Rivera?
- The same.
The charges pan out, the guy could lose his job and his pension.
Oh, and get this.
Before he was in the Transit Authority,
Mario was in the Marine Corps for eight years, where he won a weapons medal for sharpshooting.
Where were you last night between 5:00 and 7:00 p. m?
Working.
We checked.
You clocked out at 4:34 p.m.
You hopped the B or the D down to 59th Street, the express only takes, what, 10 minutes?
Plenty of time to get to the park and kill Len.
Why would I kill Len?
Because he filed a report against you with the Transit Authority when he found out about Costa Rica.
What the hell are you guys talking about?
These are emails that were sent from you to your contact in Costa Rica.
These are my private emails.
Sent from a workplace computer.
Which means we can look.
So?
I was thinking about taking a vacation down there.
Yeah.
Drink a few cervezas, maybe go parasailing on the beach.
Sell some light bulbs to some locals.
The city has a warehouse full of old incandescent light bulbs that you figured no one would miss.
So you sold them to a wholesaler in Costa Rica for 20 cents a pop.
That's a hundred grand.
Only someone did miss them.
Someone with the word "light bulb" in his name.
When you found out Len was onto you, you realized you could lose your job and your pension.
You couldn't afford to let him go to the Transit Authority with what he knew.
I didn't kill nobody.
Well then why don't you just come clean with what you did last night between 5:00 and 7:00?
The thing about murderers,
Mario, is they tend not to have solid alibis.
Generally because they're murdering somebody.
Look, those old light bulbs were just gonna get destroyed and end up in a landfill.
I was doing the city a favor.
So I make a little extra.
So who gets hurt?
I'm going to go with Len.
Last chance, Mario.
After work I went up to the Grand Concourse to pack up a shipment of light bulbs.
They went out to Costa Rica last night.
You can check.
I was there.
Thanks.
He's telling the truth.
Len's call to the tip line?
Turns out the transit cops had him under surveillance all last week.
His tail has him in the Bronx last night just like he said.
Call the transit cops and tell them that we just closed their case for them.
Right.
So if light bulbs didn't get Lenny killed, then what did?
You know, it can't be a coincidence that he was killed right there at about the same time that he has written down.
And what does BHS stand for?
- Bronx High School?
- Hmm.
Big Honking Stereo?
Boys Have Shoes?
Try Byron H. Singer.
I found a small vendor decal on the side of the parabolic microphone we found in his apartment.
So I called the vendor to find out if he knew why Len bought the equipment.
Turns out Len didn't buy it at all.
It was purchased two months ago by an insurance actuary named Byron H. Singer.
BHS.
Sorry.
Mr. Singer, thank you for coming down.
They said it was important.
Do you know a man named Len Levitt?
What did that bastard tell you?
He didn't tell us anything.
Good, because he's a liar.
He thought he knew better than me.
He thought he knew better than everybody.
- Mr. Singer...
- I don't care if he didn't believe me.
I don't care how much it hurt him.
I know what I saw.
And what did you see?
The two of them, together in the park, like a pair of lovebirds.
But he accused me of making the whole thing up.
I mean, why would I make something like that up?
Why would anybody?
Mr. Singer, what exactly did you see in the park?
I saw enough.
And believe me, I was pretty shocked to see them together.
I knew I had to tell Len before somebody else did.
Len must've been very angry when you told him.
Very angry and jealous.
But I had followed them and found their secret spot, and I told him where and when to find them.
I even lent him some of my equipment so he could spy on them himself.
So Len goes to the park and he sees for himself...
And then he confronts them in a jealous rage, and they kill him.
They do what now?
They kill him.
The cheating girlfriend and the lover.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Who did you see in the park that night?
The red-tailed hawks.
There hadn't been a nesting pair in the park for 40 years.
You mean this is about birds?
Not just birds.
The red-tailed hawks.
Len oversees the log in the Central Park boathouse where all the sightings are officially recorded, but he refused to acknowledge my sighting.
So I told him if he didn't believe me, he should go out to the park and see for himself.
They nest at dusk.
Mr. Singer, were you in the park yesterday between 5:00 and 7:00 p. m?
Usually I am, but yesterday I was in my office, working.
And can any of your colleagues verify that?
I'm sure they can.
But about the hawks, and I want this on the official record.
I would never exaggerate or fabricate a bird sighting.
It's unthinkable!
They're there and I saw them first.
I'm putting that in the official record.
So the equipment, the park, the feather, and BHS.
Looks like we've explained everything.
Yes, except why he was killed.
Good morning, Mother.
Morning.
So why is Gram on the table and why are you on the floor?
Dad, he's gone.
Theodore?
When I fed him his quinoa salad with wheat berries,
I must not have closed the cage door all the way.
And now he's gone and Ashley's going to hate me.
He's not going to hate you.
He'll understand.
No, he won't.
He trusted me and I let him down.
No, not yet you haven't.
We'll find him.
Have you looked in your room?
And in Gram's, too.
If that creature entered my room, I'm gonna need a new bed.
And wardrobe.
Dad, what if he got out?
Like out, out.
All right, Theodore's an uptown rat.
He's here someplace.
Okay, to find a rodent, you have to think like a rodent.
You are Theodore.
- What do you want?
- Food.
Nah, you got a personal chef.
You're not hungry.
Warmth.
I'd want to stay warm and safe.
Yeah, a cozy, quiet place out of the way, where no one's gonna step on you.
- Front hall closet!
- Nice.
You see him?
No.
He's not here.
He's not here.
What?
You need to go.
And leave you rat-less?
It's my responsibility, Dad.
Not yours.
I'll find him.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Right.
Call me if you need anything.
Okay.
Just so you know, I'm checking into The Plaza, and you're paying.
Okay, Castle, I'm here.
What was so important?
Your first clue is the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime.
Oh, jeez, Castle.
I haven't even had my coffee yet.
Thank you.
From the Sherlock Holmes story Silver Blaze.
Holmes unmasks the murderer because of what didn't happen.
The dog didn't bark.
That's how he knew the dog must've known the killer.
Okay, yes.
I remember the story.
Then you know that the hardest form of detection is looking for the thing that isn't there.
Byron said that Len was going to verify the hawks.
Verify, as in provide proof, which means...
He would've had a camera.
Which we didn't find.
And if he was taking pictures...
We should be able to figure out what he was up to.
We found the body here, where he took the last two bullets.
Running away from his killer.
He had a broken wrist.
From the BMX guys riding over his body.
Or he fell from a tree.
This tree.
There's a fresh divot.
It's all birds.
Red-tailed hawks.
Looks like Byron Singer was telling the truth after all.
Yeah, remind me to notify the bird police.
But I doubt it was the hawks that killed him.
Whoa!
Light Bulb Len witnessed a child abduction.
And the last thing he saw was his killer.
We don't know his name or age but we're estimating between 10 and 12 years old.
He has brown hair, hazel eyes.
He was last seen wearing shorts, sneakers and a gray and white jacket.
Now, our kidnapper is male.
Brown hair, between 5'10" and 6 foot.
He was carrying a Glock.45, which matches the size of the slugs that we found in our victim's body.
Now, both photos have time-stamps on them, so we know that the abduction took place at 5:12 p.m. on Tuesday.
After 48 hours, the chances of finding a child abduction victim alive go way down.
The only thing that matters is finding that kid.
If he's been missing for 36 hours, how come his parents haven't reported it?
They might not know.
Or they might be under duress.
He was wearing shorts, which probably means he knew he was going to the park.
Well, if he wasn't lured there, maybe he knew his kidnapper.
Well, then why would the kidnapper need a gun?
I emailed the photo to the New York State Police and the Parole Division.
They're looking into any kidnappers with this abduction MO and Esposito is canvassing that part of the park looking for any witnesses.
What about schools?
If the boy goes to a local school, they'd know he was absent.
Have uniforms fax his photo to all schools in the five boroughs.
Done.
That car looks to be like a compact or a subcompact.
Can we get the make or model?
Lab's already looking into it.
We're pulling video from all traffic cameras on streets leading in and out of the park on Tuesday evening.
Maybe we'll catch a license plate.
Or the driver's face.
What if we were to enlarge this part of the photo?
Not the face, but just this part of the window.
Are you thinking of the reflection?
I'm wondering if maybe we can see the kidnapper's face in that side-view mirror.
It's worth a shot.
I need a CSU photo tech up here now.
You sure you haven't seen him?
Man, I see so many kids every day, I couldn't tell one from the next.
What about a blue car, around the same time?
Somewhere in this area.
- Tuesday?
About 5:00?
- Yeah.
Yeah, as a matter of fact, a blue Saturn.
You sure?
Yeah, people I forget.
Things that get in my way, I remember.
It was parked right in front of my regular spot.
Instead, I gotta set up at the edge of the roadway.
I almost get clipped by a cab.
Anybody inside?
No, because I would've yelled at the driver if there was.
I don't know what's wrong with people in this city.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Our pretzel vendor IDed the kidnapper's car as a blue Saturn sedan, anywhere from '97 to '02.
The problem is there are 6,000 blue Saturns registered in the Tri-State area alone.
Ryan, where are we on the traffic cams?
The make and model will help narrow it down, but there's a lot of footage.
There's also no central database for school absences.
We can't sort by grade or gender.
And there's a bad cold making the rounds, so more kids are out than usual.
What about State Police?
Whole lot of nada.
And nothing popped on parolees with the same kidnapping MO.
Yes, I'll continue to hold.
Detective.
Enhanced and enlarged.
Thank you.
The enhancement only increased the pixilation in all these.
You can't even see there's a side-view mirror.
Well, it's not like on 24, Castle.
In the real world, zoom and enhance can only get us so far.
Yeah, but...
You can't even...
There's no reflection.
It's just mush.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
No.
God, this kid isn't that much younger than Alexis.
Don't worry.
We'll find him.
Alexis.
What?
I've seen this before.
- You've seen what?
- This mark on his sock.
Alexis used to get these when she played soccer.
They're cleat marks from when kids kick her in the shin.
If he was playing soccer in the park, he might be a part of an organized team or a league.
And youth leagues have websites that you can go to.
The parents and kids can track scores and standings.
I spoke to the league commissioner and only one 10 to 12-year-old team practiced on Tuesday, the Wildcats.
- There!
- There!
Tyler Donegal.
He's 12.
Ryan, let's get everything we can on this kid.
The clock is ticking and we gotta bring him back alive.
Tyler Donegal lives with his mother in Westchester.
Court records show that the parents' divorce was finalized two months ago.
You reach the parents?
Just got off with the mother, Mirielle Lefcourt.
She moved out of the city last year, got remarried to an anesthesiologist last month.
She says she has no idea that her son is missing.
He was spending two days in the city with her ex.
She's on her way in now.
If the father had custody, where the hell is he?
And why didn't he report the boy missing?
We're working on that, sir.
The father's a maintenance supervisor at a high rise on West Broadway and Canal.
He lives six blocks from Central Park.
Donegal called in sick for work yesterday and today.
Divorced parents, one child.
One spouse re-marries quickly.
So she dumps the janitor in the city for the doctor in the 'burbs.
All the father has left is his son.
It's got all the hallmarks of a custodial abduction.
You got a photo?
I'll get one.
Dean Donegal.
5'10", 175, brown hair.
Well, the vitals match.
Yeah, but why do you need a gun to kidnap your own son?
You just put him in the car, tell him you're going for ice cream.
What's he doing?
Hey, Beckett, the mother's here.
All right.
Ryan, you go to Dean's office.
Esposito, you check out his apartment.
Maybe something else is going on with that family.
Right.
Right.
Where's my son?
That's what we're trying to determine, Mrs. Lefcourt.
When was the last time that you spoke with him?
Two days ago, when I dropped him off at his father's.
He was supposed to be with Dean.
Have you talked to Dean?
We're trying to locate him now.
He's not at work?
He never misses work.
Can you tell me about the divorce?
How did Dean take that?
Not well.
He was very bitter and angry.
Does he own a gun?
A handgun, yes.
There were break-ins in his building.
Do you know what kind?
Why are you asking me about a gun?
Was somebody shot?
Was my son shot?
No, nobody was shot, Mrs. Lefcourt.
It's just the man who took your son was carrying a gun.
Now, I'm gonna have to show you this photograph.
Do you recognize this man?
I don't know.
Is that Dean?
I was hoping that you could tell me.
What about this car?
Is that his car?
No, Dean doesn't own a car.
He rents one as he needs one.
A Glock.
Dean's gun, it's a Glock.
We had to itemize our property for the divorce.
Mrs. Lefcourt, does Dean have a place that he likes to take Tyler?
Any favorite hangouts?
No, as far as I know, he's never taken him anywhere.
That's not true.
Dean's family has a cabin in the Poconos.
Pennsylvania State Police are on their way to the cabin.
With any luck, we'll find Tyler.
You okay?
Can't imagine how Tyler's mother feels.
Yeah, me neither.
When Alexis was four, we went Christmas shopping at some mall in White Plains.
I was trying on some charcoal fedora.
I turn around, she is gone.
Vanished.
I looked everywhere.
So did mall security, so did the police.
We searched for an hour.
You don't have to be a novelist to think of all the worst case scenarios.
Where'd you find her?
Behind a rack of winter coats.
She got bored.
She crawled underneath there and went to sleep.
To this day, I still dream about that.
Just got off with Esposito.
Looks like Dean's on the move.
What did they find?
It's what they didn't find.
No toothbrush, no deodorant, no shampoo in the shower.
I'll run his credit card for anything that indicates he's traveling.
Dean's desk?
You can't miss it, right?
Pictures everywhere.
He calls it Tyler-palooza.
Is this his only work area?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
How'd he sound when he called in sick?
Did he sound distressed?
To tell you the truth, Detective, Dean didn't call in sick.
- I covered for him.
- Why?
His ex-wife got remarried to some rich doctor, like five minutes after the divorce was final.
He had legal bills up the ass.
I figured he just needed to spend a little time with his son.
So what if he didn't call in sick?
I had his back.
That's how we do it down here.
Hey, Teresa.
All right, already.
Oh.
What's in Indy, Dean?
Maybe he's got family in Indianapolis.
A friend.
Somebody he can trust.
Someone who can hide him.
But there weren't any airline tickets purchased in his name or in Tyler's.
Yo.
The cabin's empty.
P.A. State troopers say it looks like there hasn't been anybody there in months.
We just got a hit on Dean Donegal's financials.
An hour ago, he booked a motel room in Jamaica, Queens.
That's not far from the airport.
He might still be trying to get Tyler out of town.
If we're lucky.
He shot someone, he's on the run, he's under extreme duress.
Let's get him before this ends bloody for everyone.
- NYPD!
- NYPD!
Tyler!
Hands!
Show me your hands!
Tyler!
Tyler!
Bathroom's clear.
He's not here.
Where's Tyler?
I don't know.
They told me to check into a motel and wait for further instructions.
Who did?
I don't know.
All I know is they took him.
And if I help you, they'll kill my son.
Where is Tyler, Dean?
I told you, I don't know!
Why were you going to Indianapolis?
Indian...
What are you talking about?
We know you were checking on airfares.
I was researching a trip for the holidays.
What?
You think I took my own son?
You were in a hotel by the airport.
That's where they told me to go!
Who?
Please.
They said if I talk to the cops, he's dead.
Dean, if your son is in danger, then you need to tell us what you know.
I went to pick him up after practice.
When he wasn't at the usual spot, I figured he must have walked home.
When I got back to my apartment, that phone was on my doormat.
It had a text on it.
"We have your son.
Tell no one.
Use only this phone.
"Contact the police and Tyler dies.
"Stand by, we will tell you where to go and what to do.
"Tell no one.
Your son's life depends on it."
What do they want from you?
I have no idea.
Dean's Glock is a nine millimeter.
Right make, wrong model.
Light Bulb Len was killed with a.45.
The SIM card from his cell phone is a burner.
And the text messages aren't coming from another phone.
They're coming from an internet texting service based in the Ukraine.
No IP address, untraceable.
Track the SIM and I want a printout of every text message.
Then get the electronic serial number off that phone.
I want to find out where it was purchased and by whom.
You got it, sir.
What do they want from you?
Are they after ransom?
Are you kidding?
I'm 40 grand in debt after my divorce.
I'm looking up at broke.
What about your ex-wife's new husband?
He has money.
They're not calling him.
They're calling me.
What if they find out I'm here?
I just want my son back.
Then your best option is to work with us.
Let us help you.
I need to get some air.
Look, I know that this is hard, but you have to trust us.
We will find him.
Okay.
Don't let them hurt my boy.
Where is he?
Where's Tyler?
You should've been there to pick him up at soccer practice!
I should never have agreed to joint custody.
- How could you let this happen?
- Stay of out this.
You're not family.
- He's my boy, too!
- Sit down!
That's enough!
Now I need everyone to calm down, cooperate and think.
Dean, did you notice anyone unusual hanging around your son?
Anything out of the ordinary going on in his life?
No.
I mean, I don't think so.
What about you two?
Nothing comes to mind.
No.
Now this abduction was clearly planned.
So the kidnapper had to know where Tyler was going to be...
Sir, this is a message.
It's from the kidnapper.
There's a video attached.
Hi, Dad.
I know you're worried, but I'm okay.
They say if you do what they ask, everything will be fine.
Just don't go to the police.
I'll see you soon, and don't forget to feed Ace.
Thank God.
He's alive.
There's a time-stamp on it, 1:31 a.m.
That was sent eight minutes ago.
That's a good thing, Mrs. Lefcourt.
It's called a proof of life video.
The kidnappers sent it to prove your son's alive and that you do exactly what they ask.
You will do exactly what they ask you to.
Do you understand?
Wait, play that last part again.
Don't forget to feed Ace.
Who's Ace?
I don't know any Ace.
We don't have any pets.
He's sending us a message.
He's a smart boy.
Ace could refer to a person, or a business.
Sir, there's another text.
"680 Canal Street. 30 minutes."
That's the building where I work.
What's there?
A jewelry store?
A bank?
No, just offices.
Why you?
What's so special about that building that they need you?
Oh, God.
Because I have elevator access to all the floors in the building.
You're a human key.
Sir, I just talked to the building's owner.
He's emailing blueprints and a tenant list for 680 Canal, including the secure floors.
Ryan and Esposito are with me.
We'll take Dean to the building.
I've arranged to have an ESU team standing by in striking distance.
Sir, you can't take Dean to that building.
It is way too dangerous.
He's a father who loves his son.
You're not going to be able to stop him.
And until we find the boy, we don't have any other choice.
Scrub the video, look for anything that could lead us to him.
Yes, sir.
All right.
We're a block away.
We'll be able to see and hear everything that's happening, okay?
We've cloned your phone so we'll be able to read your text in real time.
You follow the kidnapper's instructions to the letter.
No cowboy stuff, you understand me?
- Yes.
Hi, Dad.
I know you're worried, but I'm okay.
They say if you do what they ask, everything will be fine.
Just don't go to the police.
I'll see you soon, and don't forget to feed Ace.
There are no identifying markers in the background.
It's all black.
I don't know if we're gonna find him in time.
The video was taken at 1:31 a.m., but they didn't send it till 1:39.
You know, sometimes it takes a while for a text to go through.
Yeah, but eight minutes?
You want Dean to do something for you, you make a proof of life video, but you wait eight minutes to send it.
Why?
Maybe there wasn't a signal or not enough bars.
Yeah.
Maybe they had to walk a long way to get a signal?
Maybe they're under...
Underground.
Ace!
It's not Ace.
It's A-C-E.
The A, C and E subway lines.
They're holding Tyler in the subway.
He must've spotted a sign.
There's half a dozen stations where the A, C, and E stop.
There's too many to search.
Yeah, but the last stop for all three lines is on Canal Street and West Broadway.
That's...
Right under Dean's building.
They've been holding him under everyone's nose.
Let's go.
Check every room on the east-end of the station.
You guys check ticket booths on both ends.
Go!
- Right.
- Got it.
Castle, what are you thinking?
The only reason to keep him here is for a quick getaway, which is helped by the fact that 680 Canal Street has its own entrance to the subway.
If it were me, I'd keep close enough to hook up with my partners, but far enough to have it be out of the way.
Which means he's holding Tyler on the west-end of the tunnel.
West-end of the tunnel.
This room.
All right, you should stay back.
No chance.
"Go to the 37th floor.
Now."
They said 30 minutes.
It hasn't been 30 minutes yet.
They're changing the timetable in case you went to the cops.
What's on the 37th floor?
Nothing.
It's vacant.
It's not even secure.
Try Beckett.
Nothing.
It's going straight to voicemail.
She must already be in the subway.
I gotta go.
Remember, we can see and hear everything.
Anything goes south, 100 cops will be on you inside of a minute.
Not until you find my son.
Just my luck.
Pulled graveyard tonight.
All right, he's in.
Not bad with the guard.
The guy's all right.
Camera and mic are all good.
Whoa.
Take us to the 39th floor.
I want to see Tyler first.
Just follow instructions.
You'll see him soon enough.
What's on the 39th floor?
A financial firm.
Breskin and Wright.
Thirty-seven was just a staging area.
They let him see their faces.
As soon as they get what they came for, they're going to kill him.
Just like Light Bulb Len.
Beckett's still going to voicemail.
Castle, too.
Sir, what do you want to do?
If we go in before we find the kid, we might lose them both.
Beckett.
One armed and the kid.
If I go in, he'll kill him before I get a shot off.
He's holding a flashlight.
If we kill the ambient light, he'll light up like a Christmas tree.
We just...
It's like it's meant to be.
Maybe Lenny can prevent another tragedy.
On my count.
Three, two, one!
Hit P-1.
The subway.
I did what you asked.
Now where's Tyler?
You'll see him in a minute.
Sorry, Dean.
Last stop.
Lobby.
We're supposed to go to subway level.
Why are we stopping at the lobby?
Don't look at me.
No, look at me.
I suggest you drop your weapons.
Where's Tyler?
The ring leader was Robert Kincaid, former bond trader.
He's the one who planned the entire operation.
The economy might have collapsed, but he was still gonna get his payday.
Most of them were ex-Wall Streeters.
They knew that they needed biometric clearance in order to get on secure floors.
And they knew that Dean wasn't gonna help them, so they took Tyler as leverage.
But all they took were files.
Financial files containing unpublished earnings reports.
To a savvy investor, they'd be worth millions.
Would've worked too, if Light Bulb Len hadn't been taking pictures in the park.
He helped catch his own killer.
And foil the kidnapping.
It's kind of poetic.
In an unspeakably tragic sort of way.
The guy you shot in the subway?
A thug Kincaid hired to do his dirty work.
He just confessed to kidnapping Tyler, murdering Light Bulb Len and, no surprise, he ratted out Kincaid in two seconds flat.
Oh.
Speaking of rats.
I gotta...
I gotta go.
I'm the worst person in the whole world.
No, you're not.
You're wonderful and you're kind and you're sweet.
I'm a rat killer.
You don't know that.
You may just be a loser.
A rat loser.
This did not come out right.
Look, if he cares, he'll understand.
Yeah, he'll understand, all right.
When he sees me in the halls at school, he'll think,
"There's the awful girl that lost my best friend."
It's him.
Hi.
Hi.
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
What's wrong?
It's about Theodore.
When I fed him, he must've got out of his cage and...
And he's gone.
He's gone?
We looked everywhere.
I swear.
We turned this whole place upside down.
How'd he get out?
I must not have locked the cage right.
Ashley, I'm so sorry.
You have every right to hate me.
Come on, Alexis.
I'm upset, but I don't hate you.
You don't?
I mean, well, look at this place.
Look at what you did to try to get him back.
Who else would do that?
You cared about him a lot.
Yeah, but I care about you more.
Found him!
There are two kinds of folks who sit around thinking about how to kill people psychopaths and mystery writers.
I'm the kind that pays better.
Who am I?
I'm Rick Castle.
Castle.
Castle.
I really am ruggedly handsome, aren't I?
Every writer needs inspiration, and I've found mine.
I'm Detective Kate Beckett.
Beckett.
- Beckett?
- Could you get some backup, please?
And thanks to my friendship with the mayor,
I get to be on her case.
Oh!
Do I look like a killer to you?
Yes, you kill my patience.
And together, we catch killers.
- I hate this case.
- I know.
Isn't it great?
Whoa!
Oh, dude.
Oh!
Dude.
Dude.
Aw.
Science project?
No, it's a pet.
Say hello to Theodore, dad.
I'm rat-sitting him for Ashley.
Hello, Theodore.
How goes the rat race?
Did you know the average life span of a rat is two to three years?
Ashley's had Theodore for five.
And this is the first time he's left him with anyone.
Trusting you with a treasured pet...
That's a big step in a relationship.
Yeah, I guess it kind of is.
I must say, the little plague pusher is not very diligent about his exercise.
I don't know.
I-I think it's just those beady little eyes.
It's a rat, mother.
They all have beady eyes.
That's where the phrase comes from.
Mm.
Dad, those are for Theodore.
He has a very specific diet
I'm supposed to follow.
Well, unless he's Ben,
I'm sure he won't hold it against me.
If anyone needs me, I'll be in the park with a dead body.
Ah.
Who's Ben?
Killer rat movie.
Before your time.
You know, I understand ferrets as a pet...
Snakes, spiders, even a hairless mole.
But a rat?
Probably kids in this city who keep cockroaches as pets.
You're probably right.
What's the strangest pet you've ever had?
You.
Hey, Lanie.
What's this, a hit-and-run?
In a manner of speaking.
Two BMX bikers rode over the body, then called it in.
But the cause of death are the gunshot wounds...
One to the chest, and two more in the back.
So he's wounded on both sides?
Maybe there were two shooters, he was caught in the cross fire?
Won't know till I get him back to the lab.
You got an I.D.?
Leonard Levitt, Ozone Park, Queens.
Wallet, cash, keys- everything still here.
Which means it wasn't theft.
No.
Something much more nefarious.
A feather.
Alternating stripes, uniform color...
This is no ordinary pigeon feather.
This... this is from a bird of prey.
So what are you suggesting, Castle, that a bird shot him three times?
Not just any bird.
This is the calling card of a murderer known only as...
The Falcon killer.
Or maybe before getting shot, he just bent down and picked up the feather.
See, that's why you'll never be a best-selling novelist.
No sense of drama.
I find that dead bodies are usually enough.
Thanks, Lanie.
Mm-hmm.
Yo.
So we ran background on your vic.
It's pretty thin.
He was a New York city transit employee.
Worked in the subway out of the 116th street station.
He worked uptown and he lived in Queens?
Then what was he doing in the park?
That's pretty out of the way.
Well, we thought that he was looking to buy some weed or some love, but he has no drug history, no convictions of solicitations, no nothing.
And what about his family?
Both parents are deceased.
Guy never married, has no children.
It's like he barely existed.
Making him the perfect victim.
Mild-mannered city employee lured into a conveniently wooded area, struck down by a murderer with the speed and cunning of a bird of prey.
Don't ask.
You guys go to his apartment.
Find out who he is and what he was doing in the park.
Right.
Lividity and temperature puts time of death between 5:00 and 7:00 P.M.
The victim also has a broken wrist.
Could be postmortem from those BMX-ers playing X games on his corpse.
What about the gunshot wounds?
Al three entry wounds were made by the same weapon...
A .45.
There was only one shooter.
So the same person shot him in the front, and then shot him in the back?
Didn't make any sense to me either, so I decided to take some measurements.
Turns out, the wounds are of different depths.
The one on his chest is very shallow, indicating the shot came from a distance.
How far?
About 150 feet.
That's quite an accurate shot with a handgun.
Mm.
Yeah, I'd say your killer had some shooting experience.
But the next two shots in the back were close range, inside 6 feet, maybe.
So he got shot in the chest at long range, turned around to run...
But he's wounded.
The killer goes after him to finish what he started with a double tap to the back.
He wasn't just shot.
He was hunted down and killed.
But why?
Whoa.
What was this guy up to?
No idea.
What about that?
Looks like some sort of counter.
What do you think he was counting?
Nothing good.
Night vision, spotting scope, parabolic microphone...
Top quality, too.
What's a subway worker doing with all this?
I don't know.
But whatever he was into, it had something to do with the park.
Look.
This is right where his body was found.
5:26...
That's around our time of death.
Looks like he was tracking something or someone with the initials B.H.S.
And it looks like that someone found him.
Surveillance equipment, clandestine meetings, a professional hit...
Mix in the subway, and we're looking at
"The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3," or better yet, "Money Train."
Any one of these people could be a secret accomplice.
That's what I love about the subway.
Down here, everyone's got a story.
See, that's the difference between you and me, Castle.
You see the subway as a place to pick up dialogue for your novels.
Or the occasional investment banker on her way to the gym.
I, on the other hand, see it as a way of getting from point "A" to point "B."
So Lightbulb Len's dead, huh?
Lightbulb Len?
Yeah, it was his job to change the lightbulbs in the stations and tunnels all over New York.
I figured something was wrong.
It's the first time he's missed work in 22 years.
Mr. Rivera, Len was found shot to death in the park.
Any idea what he was doing there?
The guy changed lightbulbs for a living.
You know, a job like that, it's not for the social.
I mean, in the 12 years I was his supervisor,
I don't think we ever had one personal conversation.
But you know who you should talk to?
Who?
Mr. Sansone?
Arthur!
I'm sorry.
It's just...
Why would anybody want to shoot him?
Well, we were hoping that you could tell us that.
Well, the guy was one of the unsung heroes of this city.
He saved a lot of lives.
I'm sorry.
I thought...
I thought he changed lightbulbs.
Bad things happen in darkness, Mr. Castle, dimly lit tunnels, darkened stairwells.
If Len heard about a blown bulb before shift end, he would stay late, on his own time, to fix it.
And of course, there was his response to the Abe Lipschitz tragedy.
1989...
An electrocution of a bulb changer at the Brighton Beach station.
This is a circuit interrupter switch.
Shuts down all of the power inside a tunnel so that electrical maintenance could be performed safely.
Down here...
It's called the Lenny Box...
Because it took a visionary like Len Levitt to design it and force the transit authority to install one in every station in this city.
What about high-tech gear?
Did Lenny ever use any night vision or microphones for his work?
No.
Why?
How about the initials B.H.S.?
Does that mean anything to you?
Maybe someone or something that Len was keeping tabs on.
The only thing Len Levitt ever kept tabs on was every single bulb he ever changed.
Did he have any enemies that you know of?
You don't make waves without making a few enemies.
Because of Len, we're in the middle of a systemwide changeover from incandescent to compact fluorescents.
New technology comes in, the city ends up with a warehouse full of old bulbs.
That makes some guy in a suit at the old bulb factory very unhappy.
You ask me, corporations conspired to take Lenny out.
"'Lenny Box.
'" So the guy's an inventor?
Apparently he was an underground renaissance man.
Guess that explains all the electronics.
And the counter in his apartment...
All the lightbulbs he changed.
Seriously, this guy changed over a million lightbulbs?
The man was an unsung hero, all right?
Cut down by the forces of Big Bulb.
Big Bulb?
The filament-industrial complex.
Lenny's buddy is delusional if he actually thinks that Lenny was killed by a lightbulb conspiracy.
Well, I wouldn't dismiss our subterranean friend just yet.
I was running through Len's phone records, and one jumped out.
The outgoing call to the New York city employee tip line?
It's where you call to rat out your coworkers.
Must "rat" always be used in the pejorative?
In the Chinese zodiac, the rat is ac...
What was the tip?
Well, all those incandescent bulbs they were replacing?
Levitt claims that he had evidence his supervisor was stealing them and then reselling them on the black market.
You mean Mario Rivera?
The same.
The charges pan out, the guy could lose his job and his pension.
Oh, and get this, before he was in the transit authority,
Mario was in the marine corps for eight years where he won a weapons medal for sharpshooting.
Where were you last night between 5:00 and 7:00 P.M.?
Working.
We checked.
You clocked out at 4:34.
You, uh, hop the B or the D down to 59th street.
The express only takes, what, ten minutes?
Plenty of time to get to the park, kill Len.
Why would I kill Len?
Because he filed a report against you with the transit authority when he found out about Costa Rica.
What the hell are you guys talking about?
These are e-mails that were sent from you to your contact in Costa Rica.
These are my private e-mails.
Sent from a workplace computer, which means we can look.
So I was thinking about taking a vacation down there.
Yeah, drink a few cervezas, maybe go parasailing on the beach, sell some lightbulbs to some locals.
The city has a warehouse full of old, incandescent lightbulbs that you figured no one would miss, so you sold them to a wholesaler in Costa Rica for 20 cents a pop.
That's 100 grand.
Only someone did miss them.
Someone with the word "lightbulb" in his name.
When you found out Len was on to you, you realized you could lose your job and your pension.
You couldn't afford to let him go to the transit authority with what he knew.
I didn't kill nobody.
Well, then why don't you just come clean with what you did last night between 5:00 and 7:00?
The thing about murderers, Mario, is they tend to not have solid alibis.
Generally because they're murdering somebody.
Look...
Those old lightbulbs were just gonna get destroyed and end up in a landfill.
I was doing the city a favor.
So I make a little extra.
So who gets hurt?
Uh...
I'm gonna go with Len.
Last chance, Mario.
After work, I went up to the grand concourse to pack up a shipment of lightbulbs.
They went out to Costa Rica last night.
You can check.
I was there.
Thanks.
He's telling the truth.
Len's call to the tip line?
Turns out that the transit cops had him under surveillance all last week.
His tail has him in the Bronx last night just like he said.
Call the transit cops and tell them that we just closed their case for them.
Right.
So if lightbulbs didn't get Lenny killed, then what did?
You know, it can't be a coincidence that he was killed right there at about the same time that he has written down.
And what does "B.H.S." stand for?
Bronx high school?
Hmm.
Big honkin' stereo?
Boys have shoes?
Try Byron H. Singer.
I found a small vendor decal on the side of the parabolic microphone we found in his apartment, so I called the vendor to find out if he knew why Len bought the equipment.
Turns out, Len didn't buy it at all.
It was purchased two months ago by an insurance actuary named Byron H. Singer.
B.H.S.!
Sorry.
Mr. Singer, thank you for coming down.
They said it was important.
Do you know a man named Len Levitt?
What did that bastard tell you?
He didn't tell us anything.
Good, because he's a liar.
He thought he knew better than me.
He thought he knew better than everybody.
Mr. Singer...
I don't care if he didn't believe me.
I don't care how much it hurt him.
I know what I saw.
And what did you see?
The two of them, together, in the park, like a pair of lovebirds.
But he accused me of making the whole thing up.
I mean, why would I make something like that up?
Why would anybody?
Mr. Singer, what exactly did you see in the park?
I saw enough.
And believe me, I was pretty shocked to see them together.
I knew I had to tell Len before somebody else did.
Len must have been very angry when you told him.
Very angry and jealous, but I had followed them and found their secret spot.
And I told him where and when to find them.
I even lent him some of my equipment so he could spy on them himself.
So Len goes to the park, and he sees for himself.
And then he confronts them in a jealous rage, and they kill him.
They do what now?
Er.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Uh... who did you see in the park that night?
The red-tailed hawks.
Oh.
There haven't been a nesting pair in the park for 40 years.
You mean, this is about birds?
Not just birds.
The red-tailed hawks.
Len oversees the log in the central park boathouse, where all the sightings are officially recorded.
But he refused to acknowledge my sighting.
So I told him, if he didn't believe me, he should go out to the park and see for himself.
They nest at dusk.
Mr. Singer, were you in the park yesterday between 5:00 and 7:00 P.M.?
Usually I am, but yesterday I was in my office, working.
And can any of your colleagues verify that?
I'm sure they can, but about the hawks...
And I want this on the official record...
I would never exaggerate or fabricate a bird sighting.
It's unthinkable.
They're there, and I saw them first.
I'm putting that in the official record.
So the equipment, the park, the feather, and B.H.S....
It looks like we've explained everything.
Yes, except why he was killed.
Morning, mother.
Morning.
So why is gram on the table and why are you on the floor?
Dad, he's gone.
Theodore?
When I fed him his quinoa salad with wheat berries,
I must not have closed the cage door all the way, and now he's gone, and Ashley's going to hate me.
Oh, he's not gonna hate you.
He'll understand.
No, he won't.
He trusted me, and I let him down.
No, not yet, you haven't.
We'll find him.
Have you looked in your room?
And in gram's, too.
If that creature entered my room,
I'm gonna need a new bed...
And wardrobe.
Dad, what if he got out?
Like "out" out?
All right, Theodore is an uptown rat.
He's here someplace.
Okay, to find a rodent, you have to think like a rodent.
You are Theodore.
What do you want?
Food.
Eh, you got a personal chef.
You're not hungry.
Warmth.
I'd want to stay warm and safe.
Yeah, a cozy, quiet place, out of the way, where no one's gonna step on you.
Front hall closet.
Nice.
You see him?
No.
He's not here.
He's not here.
What?
You need to go.
And leave you ratless?
It's my responsibility, dad.
Not yours.
I'll find him.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
All right.
You call me...
If you need anything.
Just so you know, I'm checking into the Plaza, and you're paying.
Okay, Castle, I'm here.
What was so important?
Your first clue is...
The curious incident of the dog in the nighttime.
Oh, jeez, Castle.
I haven't even had my coffee yet.
Thank you.
From the Sherlock Holmes story, "Silver Blaze."
Holmes unmasks the murderer because of what didn't happen.
The dog didn't bark.
That's how he knew the dog must have known the killer.
Okay.
Yes, I remember the story.
Then you know that the hardest form of detection is looking for the thing that isn't there.
Byron said that Len was going to verify the hawks.
Verify, as in "provide proof," which means...
He would've had a camera...
Which we didn't find.
And if he was taking pictures...
We should be able to figure out what he was up to.
We found the body here, where he took the last two bullets...
Running away from his killer.
He had a broken wrist.
From the BMX guys riding over his body.
Or he fell from a tree.
This tree.
There's a fresh divot.
It's all birds.
Mm.
Red-tailed hawks.
Looks like Byron Singer was telling the truth after all.
Yeah, remind me to notify the bird police.
But I doubt it was the hawks that killed him.
Whoa.
Lightbulb Len witnessed a child abduction.
And the last thing he saw was his killer.
We don't know his name or age, but we're estimating between 10 and 12 years old.
He has brown hair, hazel eyes, and was last seen wearing shorts, sneakers, and a gray and white jacket.
Now our kidnapper is male, brown hair, between 5'10" and 6".
He was carrying a Glock .45, which matches the size of the slugs that we found in our victim's body.
Now both photos have time stamps on them, so we know that the abduction took place at 5:12 P.M. on Tuesday.
After 48 hours, the chances of finding a child abduction victim alive go way down.
The only thing that matters is finding that kid.
If he's been missing for 36 hours, how come his parents haven't reported it?
They might not know.
Or they might be under duress.
He was wearing shorts, which probably means he knew he was going to the park.
Well, if he wasn't lured there, maybe he knew his kidnapper.
But then why would the kidnapper need a gun?
I e-mailed the photo to the New York State Police and the parole division.
They're looking into any kidnappers with this abduction M.O.
And Esposito is canvassing that part of the park looking for any witnesses.
Well, what about schools?
If the boy goes to a local school, they'd know he was absent.
Have uniforms fax his photo to all schools in the five boroughs.
Done.
That car looks to be, like, a compact or a subcompact.
Can we get the make or model?
Lab's already looking into it.
We're pulling video from all traffic cameras on the streets leading in and out of the park on Tuesday evening.
Maybe we'll catch a license plate.
Or the driver's face.
What if we were to enlarge this part of the photo...
Not the face, just this part of the window?
Are you thinking of the reflection?
I'm wondering if maybe we can see the kidnapper's face in that side view mirror.
It's worth a shot.
I need a C.S.U. photo tech up here now.
You sure you haven't seen him?
Man, I see so many kids every day,
I couldn't tell one from the next.
What about a blue car around the same time, somewhere in this area?
Tuesday about 5:00?
Yeah.
Yeah, as a matter of fact, a blue Saturn.
You sure?
Yeah.
People I forget.
Things that get in my way, I remember.
It was parked right in front of my regular spot.
Instead, I gotta set up at the edge of the roadway.
I almost get clipped by a cab.
Anybody inside?
No, because I woulda yelled at the driver if there was.
I don't know what's wrong with people in this city.
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah.
Our pretzel vendor I.D.'ed the kidnapper's car as a blue Saturn sedan, anywhere from '97 to '02.
The problem is, there are 6,000 blue Saturns registered in the tristate area alone.
Ryan, where are we on the traffic cams?
The make and model will help narrow it down, but there's a lot of footage.
There's also no central database for school absences.
We can't sort by grade or gender, and there's a bad cold making the rounds, so more kids are out than usual.
What about state police?
Whole lot of nada, and nothing popped on parolees with the same kidnapping M.O.
Yes, I'll continue to hold.
Detective, enhanced and enlarged.
Thank you.
Oh, the enhancement only increased the pixilation on all these.
You can't even see there's a side view mirror.
Well, it's not like on "24", Castle.
In the real world, zoom and enhance can only get us so far.
Yeah, but you can't even...
There's no reflection.
It's just mush.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
No.
God, this kid isn't that much younger than Alexis.
Don't worry.
We'll find him.
Alexis.
What?
I've seen this before.
You've seen what?
This mark on his sock.
Alexis used to get these when she played soccer.
They're cleat marks from where other kids kick her in the shin.
If he was playing soccer in the park, he might be a part of an organized team or a league.
And youth leagues have web sites that you can go to.
The parents and kids can track scores and standings.
I spoke to the league commissioner, and only one 10- to 12-year-old team practiced on Tuesday...
The Wildcats.
There!
Tyler Donegal.
He's 12.
Ryan, let's get everything we can on this kid.
The clock is ticking, and we gotta bring him back alive.
Tyler Donegal lives with his mother in Westchester.
Court records show that the parents' divorce was finalized two months ago.
You reach the parents?
Just got off with the mother- Mirielle Lefcourt.
She moved out of the city last year.
Got remarried to an anesthesiologist last month.
She says she has no idea that her son is missing.
He was spending two days in the city with her ex.
She's on her way in now.
If the father had custody, where the hell is he, and why didn't he report the boy missing?
We're working on that, sir.
The father's a maintenance supervisor at High-Rise on West Broadway and Canal.
He lives six blocks from Central Park.
Yo.
Donegal called in sick for work yesterday and today.
Divorced parents, one child, one spouse remarries quickly?
So she dumps the janitor in the city for the doctor in the burbs.
All the father has left is his son.
It's got all the hallmarks of a custodial abduction.
You got a photo?
I'll get one.
Dean Donegal.
5'10", 175...
Brown hair.
Well, the vitals match.
Yeah.
Yeah, but why do you need a gun to kidnap your own son?
You just put him in the car, tell him you're going for ice cream.
What's he doing?
Hey, Beckett, the mother's here.
All right, Ryan, you go to Dean's office.
Esposito, you check out his apartment.
Maybe something else is going on with that family.
Right.
Where's my son?
That's what we're trying to determine, Mrs. Lefcourt.
When was the last time that you spoke with him?
Uh, two days ago when I dropped him off at his father's.
He was supposed to be with Dean.
Have you talked to Dean?
We're trying to locate him now.
He's not at work?
He never misses work.
Can you tell me about the divorce?
How did Dean take that?
Um, not well.
He was very bitter and angry.
Does he own a gun?
A handgun.
Yes.
There were break-ins in his building.
Do you know what kind?
Why are you asking me about a-a gun?
Was somebody shot?
Was my son shot?
No, nobody was shot, Mrs. Lefcourt.
It's just, the man who took your son was carrying a gun.
Now I'm gonna have to show you this photograph.
Do you recognize this man?
I don't know.
Is that Dean?
I was hoping that you could tell me.
What about this car?
Is that his car?
No, Dean doesn't own a car.
He... he rents one as he needs one.
A Glock.
Dean's gun, it's a Glock.
We had to itemize our property for the divorce.
Mrs. Lefcourt, does Dean have a place that he likes to take Tyler?
Any, um, favorite hangouts?
No, as far as I know, he's never taken him anywhere.
That's not true.
Dean's family has a cabin in the Poconos.
Pennsylvania state police are on their way to the cabin.
With any luck, we'll find Tyler.
You okay?
I can't imagine how Tyler's mother feels.
Yeah, me neither.
When Alexis was 4, we went Christmas shopping at some mall in... in White Plains.
I was trying on some charcoal fedora.
I turn around, she is gone, vanished.
I looked everywhere, so did mall security, so did the police.
We searched for an hour.
You don't have to be a novelist to think of all the worst-case scenarios.
Where'd you find her?
Behind a rack of winter coats.
She got bored.
She crawled underneath there and went to sleep.
To this day, I still dream about that.
Just got off with Esposito.
Looks like Dean's on the move.
What did they find?
It's what they didn't find...
No toothbrush, no deodorant, no shampoo in the shower.
I'll run his credit card for anything that indicates he's traveling.
Dean's desk?
You can't miss it, right?
Pictures everywhere.
He calls it Tyler-Palooza.
Is this his only work area?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
How'd he sound when he called in sick?
Did he sound... stressed?
Tell you the truth, Detective, Dean didn't call in sick.
I covered for him.
Why?
His ex-wife got remarried to some rich doctor like five minutes after the divorce was final.
He had legal bills up the ass.
I figured, he just needed to spend a little time with his son.
So what if he didn't call in sick?
I had his back.
That's how we do it down here.
Hey, Teresa!
All right, already.
Whoa.
What's in Indy, Dean?
Maybe he's got family in Indianapolis...
Someone who can hide him.
Yeah, but there weren't any airline tickets purchased in his name or in Tyler's.
Yo, the cabin's empty.
P.A. State Troopers say it looks like there hasn't been anybody there in months.
We just got a hit on Dean Donegal's financials.
An hour ago, he booked a motel room in Jamaica, Queens.
That's not far from the airport.
He might still be trying to get Tyler out of town.
If we're lucky.
He shot someone, he's on the run, he's under extreme duress.
Let's get him before this ends bloody for everyone.
NYPD!
Tyler!
Tyler, you here?
!
Hands!
Show me your hands!
Tyler!
Bathroom's clear.
He's not here.
Where's Tyler?
I don't know.
They told me to check into a motel and wait for further instructions.
Who did?
I don't know.
All I know is, they took him.
And if I help you, they'll kill my son.
Where is Tyler, Dean?
I told you, I don't know.
Why were you going to Indianapolis?
Indian...
What are you talking about?
We know you were checking on airfares.
I was researching a trip for the holidays.
What, you think I took my own son?
You were in a hotel by the airport.
That's where they told me to go.
Who?
Please.
They said, if I talk to the cops, he's dead.
Dean, if you're son is in danger, then you need to tell us what you know.
I went to pick him up after practice.
When he wasn't at the usual spot,
I figured he must have walked home.
When I got back to my apartment, that phone was on my doormat.
It had a text on it.
"We have your son.
Tell no one.
Use only this phone."
Contact the police, and Tyler dies."
"Stand by.
We will tell you where to go and what to do.
Tell no one.
Your son's life depends on it."
What do they want from you?
I have no idea.
Dean's Glock is a 9 millimeter.
Right make, wrong model.
Lightbulb Len was killed with a .45.
The SIM card from his cell phone is a burner, and the text messages aren't coming from another phone.
They're coming from an Internet texting service based in the Ukraine- no I.P. Address, untraceable.
Track the SIM.
I want a printout of every text message.
And get the electronic serial number off that phone.
I want to find out where it was purchased and by whom.
You got it, sir.
What do they want from you?
Are they after a ransom?
Are you kidding?
I'm 40 grand in debt after my divorce.
I'm looking up at broke.
What about your ex-wife's new husband?
He has money.
They're not calling him.
They're calling me.
What if they find out I'm here?
I just want my son back.
Then your best option is to work with us.
Let us help you.
I need to get some air.
Look, I know that this is hard.
But you have to trust us.
We will find him.
Okay.
Don't let 'em hurt my boy.
Where is he?
Where is Tyler?
You should've been there to pick him up at soccer practice!
We're doing everything we can.
This is why I should've never agreed to joint custody.
It's gonna be all right.
Stay outta this.
You're not family.
He's my boy, too!
Sit down!
That's enough!
Now I need everyone to calm down, cooperate, and think.
Dean, you notice anyone unusual hanging around your son, anything out of the ordinary going on in his life?
No.
I mean, I...
I don't think so.
What about you two?
Nothing comes to mind.
No.
Now this abduction was clearly planned.
So the kidnapper had to know where Tyler was gonna be.
Sir, this is a message.
It's from the kidnapper.
There's a video attached.
Hi, dad.
I know you're worried, but I'm okay.
They say if you do what they ask, everything will be fine.
Just don't go to the police.
I'll see you soon, and don't forget to feed Ace.
Oh, thank God he's alive.
There's a time stamp on it...
1:31 A.M.
That was sent eight minutes ago.
It's a good thing, Mrs. Lefcourt.
It's called a proof of life video.
The kidnapper sent it to prove your son's alive, and that you do exactly what they ask.
Okay.
You will do exactly what they ask you to.
Do you understand?
Wait.
Play that last part again.
Don't forget to feed Ace.
Who's Ace?
I don't know any Ace.
We don't have any pets.
He's sending us a message.
He's a smart boy.
Uh, Ace could refer to a person or a business.
Sir, there's another text.
"680 Canal Street. 30 minutes."
That's the building where I work.
What's there, a jewelry store, a bank?
No, just offices.
Well, why you?
What's so special about that building that they need you?
Uh...
Oh, God.
Because I have elevator access to all the floors in the building.
You're a human key.
Sir, I just talked to the building's owner.
He's e-mailing blueprints and a tenant list for 680 Canal, including the secure floors.
Ryan and
Esposito are with me.
We'll take Dean to the building.
I've arranged to have an E.S.U. team standing by in striking distance.
Sir, you can't take Dean to that building.
It is way too dangerous.
He's a father who loves his son.
You're not gonna be able to stop him.
And until we find the boy, we don't have any other choice.
Scrub the video.
Look for anything that could lead us to him.
Yes, sir.
All right.
We're a block away.
We'll be able to see and hear everything that's happening, okay?
And we cloned your phone so we'll be able to read your texts in real time.
You follow the kidnapper's instructions to the letter.
No cowboy stuff, you understand me?
Yes.
Hi, dad.
I know you're worried, but I'm okay.
They say if you do what they ask, everything will be fine.
Just don't go to the police.
I'll see you soon, and don't forget to feed Ace.
There are no identifying markers in the background.
It's all black.
I don't know if we're gonna find him in time.
The video was taken at 1:31 A.M.
But they didn't send it till 1:39.
Yeah, well, sometimes it takes a while for a text to go through.
Yeah, but eight minutes?
You want Dean to do something for you.
You make a proof of life video.
But you wait eight minutes to send it.
Why?
Well, maybe there wasn't a signal or not enough bars.
Yeah.
Maybe they had to walk a long way to get a signal.
Maybe they were under a...
Underground.
"Ace.
" It's not "Ace."
It's A-C-E...
The A, C, and E subway lines.
They're holding Tyler in the subway.
He must have spotted a sign.
There's half a dozen stations where the A, C, and E stop.
That's too many to search.
Yeah, but the last stop for all three lines is on Canal Street and West Broadway.
That's...
Right under Dean's building.
They've been holding him under everyone's nose.
Let's go.
Check every room on the east end of the station.
You guys, check ticket booths on both ends.
Go.
Right.
Got it.
Castle, what are you thinking?
The only reason to keep him here is for a quick getaway, which is helped by the fact that 680 Canal Street has its own entrance to the subway.
If it were me...
I'd keep close enough to hook up with my partners but far enough that I would be out of the way.
Which means he's holding Tyler on the west end of the tunnel.
West end of the tunnel?
This room.
All right.
You should stay back.
No chance.
"Go to the 37th floor now."
They said 30 minutes.
It hasn't been 30 minutes yet.
They're changing the timetable in case you went to the cops.
What's on the 37th floor?
Nothing.
It's vacant.
It's not even secure.
Try Beckett.
Nothing.
It's going straight to voice mail.
She must already be in the subway.
I gotta go.
Remember, we can see and hear everything.
Anything goes south, a hundred cops will be on you inside a minute.
Not until you find my son.
Just my luck.
Pulled graveyard tonight.
All right.
He's in.
Not bad with the guard.
Guy's all right.
Camera and mic are all good.
Whoa.
Take us to the 39th floor.
I want to see Tyler first.
Just follow instructions.
You'll see him soon enough.
What's on the 39th floor?
A financial firm...
Breskin Wright.
37 was just a staging area.
They let him see their faces.
As soon as they get what they came for, they're gonna kill him.
Just like Lightbulb Len.
Beckett's still going to voice mail.
Castle, too.
Sir... what do you want to do?
If we go in before we find the kid, we might lose 'em both.
Beckett.
One armed and the kid.
If I go in, he'll kill him before I get a shot off.
He's holding a flashlight.
If we kill the ambient light, he'll light up like a Christmas tree.
We just...
It's like it's meant to be.
Maybe Lenny can prevent another tragedy.
On my count.
Three, two...
One.
Hit P-1.
The subway.
I did what you asked.
Now where's Tyler?
You'll see him in a minute.
Sorry, Dean.
Last stop.
Lobby.
We're supposed to go to subway level.
Why are we stopping at the lobby?
Don't look at me.
No, look at me.
I suggest you drop your weapons.
Where's Tyler?
The ringleader was Robert Kincaid...
Former bond trader.
He's the one who planned the entire operation.
The economy might have collapsed, but he was still gonna get his payday.
Most of them were ex wall streeters.
They knew that they needed a biometric clearance in order to get on secure floors, and they knew that Dean wasn't gonna help them, so they took Tyler as leverage.
But all they took were files.
Financial files, containing unpublished earnings reports.
To a savvy investor, they'd be worth millions.
Would've worked, too, if Lightbulb Len hadn't have been taking pictures in the park.
Mm.
He helped catch his own killer.
And foiled a kidnapping.
It's kind of poetic...
In an unspeakably tragic sort of way.
Mm.
The guy you shot in the subway?
The thug Kincaid hired to do his dirty work.
He just confessed to kidnapping Tyler, murdering Lightbulb Len, and no surprise, he ratted out Kincaid in two seconds flat.
Oh.
Speaking of rats...
I-I gotta...
I gotta go.
I'm the worst person in the whole world.
No, you're not.
You're wonderful, and you're kind, and you're sweet.
I'm a rat killer.
You don't know that.
You may just be a loser.
A-a rat loser.
This did not come out right.
Look...
If he cares, he'll understand.
Yeah, he'll understand, all right.
When he sees me in the halls at school, he'll think, there's the awful girl that lost my best friend.
It's him.
Hi.
Hi.
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
W-what's wrong?
It's about Theodore.
When I fed him, he must have got out of his cage, and...
And he's gone.
He's gone?
We looked everywhere.
I swear.
We've turned this whole place upside down.
How'd he get out?
I must not have locked the cage right.
Ashley, I'm so sorry.
You have every right to hate me.
Come on, Alexis.
I...
I'm...
I'm upset, but I don't hate you.
You don't?
I mean, no, look at this place.
Look at what you did to try to get him back.
Who else would do that?
You cared about him a lot.
Yeah, but...
I care about you more.
There are two kinds of folks who sit around thinking about how to kill people psychopaths and mystery writers.
I'm the kind that pays better.
Who am I?
I'm Rick Castle.
Castle.
Castle.
I really am ruggedly handsome, aren't I?
Every writer needs inspiration, and I've found mine.
I'm Detective Kate Beckett.
Beckett.
- Beckett?
- Could you get some backup, please?
And thanks to my friendship with the mayor,
I get to be on her case.
Oh!
Do I look like a killer to you?
Yes, you kill my patience.
And together, we catch killers.
- I hate this case.
- I know.
Isn't it great?
Whoa!
Oh, dude.
Oh!
Dude.
Dude.
Aw.
Science project?
No, it's a pet.
Say hello to Theodore, dad.
I'm rat-sitting him for Ashley.
Hello, Theodore.
How goes the rat race?
Did you know the average life span of a rat is two to three years?
Ashley's had Theodore for five.
And this is the first time he's left him with anyone.
Trusting you with a treasured pet...
That's a big step in a relationship.
Yeah, I guess it kind of is.
I must say, the little plague pusher is not very diligent about his exercise.
I don't know.
I-I think it's just those beady little eyes.
It's a rat, mother.
They all have beady eyes.
That's where the phrase comes from.
Mm.
Dad, those are for Theodore.
He has a very specific diet
I'm supposed to follow.
Well, unless he's Ben,
I'm sure he won't hold it against me.
If anyone needs me, I'll be in the park with a dead body.
Ah.
Who's Ben?
Killer rat movie.
Before your time.
You know, I understand ferrets as a pet...
Snakes, spiders, even a hairless mole.
But a rat?
Probably kids in this city who keep cockroaches as pets.
You're probably right.
What's the strangest pet you've ever had?
You.
Hey, Lanie.
What's this, a hit-and-run?
In a manner of speaking.
Two BMX bikers rode over the body, then called it in.
But the cause of death are the gunshot wounds...
One to the chest, and two more in the back.
So he's wounded on both sides?
Maybe there were two shooters, he was caught in the cross fire?
Won't know till I get him back to the lab.
You got an I.D.?
Leonard Levitt, Ozone Park, Queens.
Wallet, cash, keys- everything still here.
Which means it wasn't theft.
No.
Something much more nefarious.
A feather.
Alternating stripes, uniform color...
This is no ordinary pigeon feather.
This... this is from a bird of prey.
So what are you suggesting, Castle, that a bird shot him three times?
Not just any bird.
This is the calling card of a murderer known only as...
The Falcon killer.
Or maybe before getting shot, he just bent down and picked up the feather.
See, that's why you'll never be a best-selling novelist.
No sense of drama.
I find that dead bodies are usually enough.
Thanks, Lanie.
Mm-hmm.
Yo.
So we ran background on your vic.
It's pretty thin.
He was a New York city transit employee.
Worked in the subway out of the 116th street station.
He worked uptown and he lived in Queens?
Then what was he doing in the park?
That's pretty out of the way.
Well, we thought that he was looking to buy some weed or some love, but he has no drug history, no convictions of solicitations, no nothing.
And what about his family?
Both parents are deceased.
Guy never married, has no children.
It's like he barely existed.
Making him the perfect victim.
Mild-mannered city employee lured into a conveniently wooded area, struck down by a murderer with the speed and cunning of a bird of prey.
Don't ask.
You guys go to his apartment.
Find out who he is and what he was doing in the park.
Right.
Lividity and temperature puts time of death between 5:00 and 7:00 P.M.
The victim also has a broken wrist.
Could be postmortem from those BMX-ers playing X games on his corpse.
What about the gunshot wounds?
Al three entry wounds were made by the same weapon...
A .45.
There was only one shooter.
So the same person shot him in the front, and then shot him in the back?
Didn't make any sense to me either, so I decided to take some measurements.
Turns out, the wounds are of different depths.
The one on his chest is very shallow, indicating the shot came from a distance.
How far?
About 150 feet.
That's quite an accurate shot with a handgun.
Mm.
Yeah, I'd say your killer had some shooting experience.
But the next two shots in the back were close range, inside 6 feet, maybe.
So he got shot in the chest at long range, turned around to run...
But he's wounded.
The killer goes after him to finish what he started with a double tap to the back.
He wasn't just shot.
He was hunted down and killed.
But why?
Whoa.
What was this guy up to?
No idea.
What about that?
Looks like some sort of counter.
What do you think he was counting?
Nothing good.
Night vision, spotting scope, parabolic microphone...
Top quality, too.
What's a subway worker doing with all this?
I don't know.
But whatever he was into, it had something to do with the park.
Look.
This is right where his body was found.
5:26...
That's around our time of death.
Looks like he was tracking something or someone with the initials B.H.S.
And it looks like that someone found him.
Surveillance equipment, clandestine meetings, a professional hit...
Mix in the subway, and we're looking at
"The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3," or better yet, "Money Train."
Any one of these people could be a secret accomplice.
That's what I love about the subway.
Down here, everyone's got a story.
See, that's the difference between you and me, Castle.
You see the subway as a place to pick up dialogue for your novels.
Or the occasional investment banker on her way to the gym.
I, on the other hand, see it as a way of getting from point "A" to point "B."
So Lightbulb Len's dead, huh?
Lightbulb Len?
Yeah, it was his job to change the lightbulbs in the stations and tunnels all over New York.
I figured something was wrong.
It's the first time he's missed work in 22 years.
Mr. Rivera, Len was found shot to death in the park.
Any idea what he was doing there?
The guy changed lightbulbs for a living.
You know, a job like that, it's not for the social.
I mean, in the 12 years I was his supervisor,
I don't think we ever had one personal conversation.
But you know who you should talk to?
Who?
Mr. Sansone?
Arthur!
I'm sorry.
It's just...
Why would anybody want to shoot him?
Well, we were hoping that you could tell us that.
Well, the guy was one of the unsung heroes of this city.
He saved a lot of lives.
I'm sorry.
I thought...
I thought he changed lightbulbs.
Bad things happen in darkness, Mr. Castle, dimly lit tunnels, darkened stairwells.
If Len heard about a blown bulb before shift end, he would stay late, on his own time, to fix it.
And of course, there was his response to the Abe Lipschitz tragedy.
1989...
An electrocution of a bulb changer at the Brighton Beach station.
This is a circuit interrupter switch.
Shuts down all of the power inside a tunnel so that electrical maintenance could be performed safely.
Down here...
It's called the Lenny Box...
Because it took a visionary like Len Levitt to design it and force the transit authority to install one in every station in this city.
What about high-tech gear?
Did Lenny ever use any night vision or microphones for his work?
No.
Why?
How about the initials B.H.S.?
Does that mean anything to you?
Maybe someone or something that Len was keeping tabs on.
The only thing Len Levitt ever kept tabs on was every single bulb he ever changed.
Did he have any enemies that you know of?
You don't make waves without making a few enemies.
Because of Len, we're in the middle of a systemwide changeover from incandescent to compact fluorescents.
New technology comes in, the city ends up with a warehouse full of old bulbs.
That makes some guy in a suit at the old bulb factory very unhappy.
You ask me, corporations conspired to take Lenny out.
"'Lenny Box.
'" So the guy's an inventor?
Apparently he was an underground renaissance man.
Guess that explains all the electronics.
And the counter in his apartment...
All the lightbulbs he changed.
Seriously, this guy changed over a million lightbulbs?
The man was an unsung hero, all right?
Cut down by the forces of Big Bulb.
Big Bulb?
The filament-industrial complex.
Lenny's buddy is delusional if he actually thinks that Lenny was killed by a lightbulb conspiracy.
Well, I wouldn't dismiss our subterranean friend just yet.
I was running through Len's phone records, and one jumped out.
The outgoing call to the New York city employee tip line?
It's where you call to rat out your coworkers.
Must "rat" always be used in the pejorative?
In the Chinese zodiac, the rat is ac...
What was the tip?
Well, all those incandescent bulbs they were replacing?
Levitt claims that he had evidence his supervisor was stealing them and then reselling them on the black market.
You mean Mario Rivera?
The same.
The charges pan out, the guy could lose his job and his pension.
Oh, and get this, before he was in the transit authority,
Mario was in the marine corps for eight years where he won a weapons medal for sharpshooting.
♪ Castle 3x08 ♪ Murder Most Fowl Original Air Date on November 8, 2010
Where were you last night between 5:00 and 7:00 P.M.?
Working.
We checked.
You clocked out at 4:34.
You, uh, hop the B or the D down to 59th street.
The express only takes, what, ten minutes?
Plenty of time to get to the park, kill Len.
Why would I kill Len?
Because he filed a report against you with the transit authority when he found out about Costa Rica.
What the hell are you guys talking about?
These are e-mails that were sent from you to your contact in Costa Rica.
These are my private e-mails.
Sent from a workplace computer, which means we can look.
So I was thinking about taking a vacation down there.
Yeah, drink a few cervezas, maybe go parasailing on the beach, sell some lightbulbs to some locals.
The city has a warehouse full of old, incandescent lightbulbs that you figured no one would miss, so you sold them to a wholesaler in Costa Rica for 20 cents a pop.
That's 100 grand.
Only someone did miss them.
Someone with the word "lightbulb" in his name.
When you found out Len was on to you, you realized you could lose your job and your pension.
You couldn't afford to let him go to the transit authority with what he knew.
I didn't kill nobody.
Well, then why don't you just come clean with what you did last night between 5:00 and 7:00?
The thing about murderers, Mario, is they tend to not have solid alibis.
Generally because they're murdering somebody.
Look...
Those old lightbulbs were just gonna get destroyed and end up in a landfill.
I was doing the city a favor.
So I make a little extra.
So who gets hurt?
Uh...
I'm gonna go with Len.
Last chance, Mario.
After work, I went up to the grand concourse to pack up a shipment of lightbulbs.
They went out to Costa Rica last night.
You can check.
I was there.
Thanks.
He's telling the truth.
Len's call to the tip line?
Turns out that the transit cops had him under surveillance all last week.
His tail has him in the Bronx last night just like he said.
Call the transit cops and tell them that we just closed their case for them.
Right.
So if lightbulbs didn't get Lenny killed, then what did?
You know, it can't be a coincidence that he was killed right there at about the same time that he has written down.
And what does "B.H.S." stand for?
Bronx high school?
Hmm.
Big honkin' stereo?
Boys have shoes?
Try Byron H. Singer.
I found a small vendor decal on the side of the parabolic microphone we found in his apartment, so I called the vendor to find out if he knew why Len bought the equipment.
Turns out, Len didn't buy it at all.
It was purchased two months ago by an insurance actuary named Byron H. Singer.
B.H.S.!
Sorry.
Mr. Singer, thank you for coming down.
They said it was important.
Do you know a man named Len Levitt?
What did that bastard tell you?
He didn't tell us anything.
Good, because he's a liar.
He thought he knew better than me.
He thought he knew better than everybody.
Mr. Singer...
I don't care if he didn't believe me.
I don't care how much it hurt him.
I know what I saw.
And what did you see?
The two of them, together, in the park, like a pair of lovebirds.
But he accused me of making the whole thing up.
I mean, why would I make something like that up?
Why would anybody?
Mr. Singer, what exactly did you see in the park?
I saw enough.
And believe me, I was pretty shocked to see them together.
I knew I had to tell Len before somebody else did.
Len must have been very angry when you told him.
Very angry and jealous, but I had followed them and found their secret spot.
And I told him where and when to find them.
I even lent him some of my equipment so he could spy on them himself.
So Len goes to the park, and he sees for himself.
And then he confronts them in a jealous rage, and they kill him.
They do what now?
Er.
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Uh... who did you see in the park that night?
The red-tailed hawks.
Oh.
There haven't been a nesting pair in the park for 40 years.
You mean, this is about birds?
Not just birds.
The red-tailed hawks.
Len oversees the log in the central park boathouse, where all the sightings are officially recorded.
But he refused to acknowledge my sighting.
So I told him, if he didn't believe me, he should go out to the park and see for himself.
They nest at dusk.
Mr. Singer, were you in the park yesterday between 5:00 and 7:00 P.M.?
Usually I am, but yesterday I was in my office, working.
And can any of your colleagues verify that?
I'm sure they can, but about the hawks...
And I want this on the official record...
I would never exaggerate or fabricate a bird sighting.
It's unthinkable.
They're there, and I saw them first.
I'm putting that in the official record.
So the equipment, the park, the feather, and B.H.S....
It looks like we've explained everything.
Yes, except why he was killed.
Morning, mother.
Morning.
So why is gram on the table and why are you on the floor?
Dad, he's gone.
Theodore?
When I fed him his quinoa salad with wheat berries,
I must not have closed the cage door all the way, and now he's gone, and Ashley's going to hate me.
Oh, he's not gonna hate you.
He'll understand.
No, he won't.
He trusted me, and I let him down.
No, not yet, you haven't.
We'll find him.
Have you looked in your room?
And in gram's, too.
If that creature entered my room,
I'm gonna need a new bed...
And wardrobe.
Dad, what if he got out?
Like "out" out?
All right, Theodore is an uptown rat.
He's here someplace.
Okay, to find a rodent, you have to think like a rodent.
You are Theodore.
What do you want?
Food.
Eh, you got a personal chef.
You're not hungry.
Warmth.
I'd want to stay warm and safe.
Yeah, a cozy, quiet place, out of the way, where no one's gonna step on you.
Front hall closet.
Nice.
You see him?
No.
He's not here.
He's not here.
What?
You need to go.
And leave you ratless?
It's my responsibility, dad.
Not yours.
I'll find him.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
All right.
You call me...
If you need anything.
Just so you know, I'm checking into the Plaza, and you're paying.
Okay, Castle, I'm here.
What was so important?
Your first clue is...
The curious incident of the dog in the nighttime.
Oh, jeez, Castle.
I haven't even had my coffee yet.
Thank you.
From the Sherlock Holmes story, "Silver Blaze."
Holmes unmasks the murderer because of what didn't happen.
The dog didn't bark.
That's how he knew the dog must have known the killer.
Okay.
Yes, I remember the story.
Then you know that the hardest form of detection is looking for the thing that isn't there.
Byron said that Len was going to verify the hawks.
Verify, as in "provide proof," which means...
He would've had a camera...
Which we didn't find.
And if he was taking pictures...
We should be able to figure out what he was up to.
We found the body here, where he took the last two bullets...
Running away from his killer.
He had a broken wrist.
From the BMX guys riding over his body.
Or he fell from a tree.
This tree.
There's a fresh divot.
It's all birds.
Mm.
Red-tailed hawks.
Looks like Byron Singer was telling the truth after all.
Yeah, remind me to notify the bird police.
But I doubt it was the hawks that killed him.
Whoa.
Lightbulb Len witnessed a child abduction.
And the last thing he saw was his killer.
We don't know his name or age, but we're estimating between 10 and 12 years old.
He has brown hair, hazel eyes, and was last seen wearing shorts, sneakers, and a gray and white jacket.
Now our kidnapper is male, brown hair, between 5'10" and 6".
He was carrying a Glock .45, which matches the size of the slugs that we found in our victim's body.
Now both photos have time stamps on them, so we know that the abduction took place at 5:12 P.M. on Tuesday.
After 48 hours, the chances of finding a child abduction victim alive go way down.
The only thing that matters is finding that kid.
If he's been missing for 36 hours, how come his parents haven't reported it?
They might not know.
Or they might be under duress.
He was wearing shorts, which probably means he knew he was going to the park.
Well, if he wasn't lured there, maybe he knew his kidnapper.
But then why would the kidnapper need a gun?
I e-mailed the photo to the New York State Police and the parole division.
They're looking into any kidnappers with this abduction M.O.
And Esposito is canvassing that part of the park looking for any witnesses.
Well, what about schools?
If the boy goes to a local school, they'd know he was absent.
Have uniforms fax his photo to all schools in the five boroughs.
Done.
That car looks to be, like, a compact or a subcompact.
Can we get the make or model?
Lab's already looking into it.
We're pulling video from all traffic cameras on the streets leading in and out of the park on Tuesday evening.
Maybe we'll catch a license plate.
Or the driver's face.
What if we were to enlarge this part of the photo...
Not the face, just this part of the window?
Are you thinking of the reflection?
I'm wondering if maybe we can see the kidnapper's face in that side view mirror.
It's worth a shot.
I need a C.S.U. photo tech up here now.
You sure you haven't seen him?
Man, I see so many kids every day,
I couldn't tell one from the next.
What about a blue car around the same time, somewhere in this area?
Tuesday about 5:00?
Yeah.
Yeah, as a matter of fact, a blue Saturn.
You sure?
Yeah.
People I forget.
Things that get in my way, I remember.
It was parked right in front of my regular spot.
Instead, I gotta set up at the edge of the roadway.
I almost get clipped by a cab.
Anybody inside?
No, because I woulda yelled at the driver if there was.
I don't know what's wrong with people in this city.
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah.
Our pretzel vendor I.D.'ed the kidnapper's car as a blue Saturn sedan, anywhere from '97 to '02.
The problem is, there are 6,000 blue Saturns registered in the tristate area alone.
Ryan, where are we on the traffic cams?
The make and model will help narrow it down, but there's a lot of footage.
There's also no central database for school absences.
We can't sort by grade or gender, and there's a bad cold making the rounds, so more kids are out than usual.
What about state police?
Whole lot of nada, and nothing popped on parolees with the same kidnapping M.O.
Yes, I'll continue to hold.
Detective, enhanced and enlarged.
Thank you.
Oh, the enhancement only increased the pixilation on all these.
You can't even see there's a side view mirror.
Well, it's not like on "24", Castle.
In the real world, zoom and enhance can only get us so far.
Yeah, but you can't even...
There's no reflection.
It's just mush.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
No.
God, this kid isn't that much younger than Alexis.
Don't worry.
We'll find him.
Alexis.
What?
I've seen this before.
You've seen what?
This mark on his sock.
Alexis used to get these when she played soccer.
They're cleat marks from where other kids kick her in the shin.
If he was playing soccer in the park, he might be a part of an organized team or a league.
And youth leagues have web sites that you can go to.
The parents and kids can track scores and standings.
I spoke to the league commissioner, and only one 10- to 12-year-old team practiced on Tuesday...
The Wildcats.
There!
Tyler Donegal.
He's 12.
Ryan, let's get everything we can on this kid.
The clock is ticking, and we gotta bring him back alive.
Tyler Donegal lives with his mother in Westchester.
Court records show that the parents' divorce was finalized two months ago.
You reach the parents?
Just got off with the mother- Mirielle Lefcourt.
She moved out of the city last year.
Got remarried to an anesthesiologist last month.
She says she has no idea that her son is missing.
He was spending two days in the city with her ex.
She's on her way in now.
If the father had custody, where the hell is he, and why didn't he report the boy missing?
We're working on that, sir.
The father's a maintenance supervisor at High-Rise on West Broadway and Canal.
He lives six blocks from Central Park.
Yo.
Donegal called in sick for work yesterday and today.
Divorced parents, one child, one spouse remarries quickly?
So she dumps the janitor in the city for the doctor in the burbs.
All the father has left is his son.
It's got all the hallmarks of a custodial abduction.
You got a photo?
I'll get one.
Dean Donegal.
5'10", 175...
Brown hair.
Well, the vitals match.
Yeah.
Yeah, but why do you need a gun to kidnap your own son?
You just put him in the car, tell him you're going for ice cream.
What's he doing?
Hey, Beckett, the mother's here.
All right, Ryan, you go to Dean's office.
Esposito, you check out his apartment.
Maybe something else is going on with that family.
Right.
Where's my son?
That's what we're trying to determine, Mrs. Lefcourt.
When was the last time that you spoke with him?
Uh, two days ago when I dropped him off at his father's.
He was supposed to be with Dean.
Have you talked to Dean?
We're trying to locate him now.
He's not at work?
He never misses work.
Can you tell me about the divorce?
How did Dean take that?
Um, not well.
He was very bitter and angry.
Does he own a gun?
A handgun.
Yes.
There were break-ins in his building.
Do you know what kind?
Why are you asking me about a-a gun?
Was somebody shot?
Was my son shot?
No, nobody was shot, Mrs. Lefcourt.
It's just, the man who took your son was carrying a gun.
Now I'm gonna have to show you this photograph.
Do you recognize this man?
I don't know.
Is that Dean?
I was hoping that you could tell me.
What about this car?
Is that his car?
No, Dean doesn't own a car.
He... he rents one as he needs one.
A Glock.
Dean's gun, it's a Glock.
We had to itemize our property for the divorce.
Mrs. Lefcourt, does Dean have a place that he likes to take Tyler?
Any, um, favorite hangouts?
No, as far as I know, he's never taken him anywhere.
That's not true.
Dean's family has a cabin in the Poconos.
Pennsylvania state police are on their way to the cabin.
With any luck, we'll find Tyler.
You okay?
I can't imagine how Tyler's mother feels.
Yeah, me neither.
When Alexis was 4, we went Christmas shopping at some mall in... in White Plains.
I was trying on some charcoal fedora.
I turn around, she is gone, vanished.
I looked everywhere, so did mall security, so did the police.
We searched for an hour.
You don't have to be a novelist to think of all the worst-case scenarios.
Where'd you find her?
Behind a rack of winter coats.
She got bored.
She crawled underneath there and went to sleep.
To this day, I still dream about that.
Just got off with Esposito.
Looks like Dean's on the move.
What did they find?
It's what they didn't find...
No toothbrush, no deodorant, no shampoo in the shower.
I'll run his credit card for anything that indicates he's traveling.
Dean's desk?
You can't miss it, right?
Pictures everywhere.
He calls it Tyler-Palooza.
Is this his only work area?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
How'd he sound when he called in sick?
Did he sound... stressed?
Tell you the truth, Detective, Dean didn't call in sick.
I covered for him.
Why?
His ex-wife got remarried to some rich doctor like five minutes after the divorce was final.
He had legal bills up the ass.
I figured, he just needed to spend a little time with his son.
So what if he didn't call in sick?
I had his back.
That's how we do it down here.
Hey, Teresa!
All right, already.
Whoa.
What's in Indy, Dean?
Maybe he's got family in Indianapolis...
Someone who can hide him.
Yeah, but there weren't any airline tickets purchased in his name or in Tyler's.
Yo, the cabin's empty.
P.A. State Troopers say it looks like there hasn't been anybody there in months.
We just got a hit on Dean Donegal's financials.
An hour ago, he booked a motel room in Jamaica, Queens.
That's not far from the airport.
He might still be trying to get Tyler out of town.
If we're lucky.
He shot someone, he's on the run, he's under extreme duress.
Let's get him before this ends bloody for everyone.
NYPD!
Tyler!
Tyler, you here?
!
Hands!
Show me your hands!
Tyler!
Bathroom's clear.
He's not here.
Where's Tyler?
I don't know.
They told me to check into a motel and wait for further instructions.
Who did?
I don't know.
All I know is, they took him.
And if I help you, they'll kill my son.
Where is Tyler, Dean?
I told you, I don't know.
Why were you going to Indianapolis?
Indian...
What are you talking about?
We know you were checking on airfares.
I was researching a trip for the holidays.
What, you think I took my own son?
You were in a hotel by the airport.
That's where they told me to go.
Who?
Please.
They said, if I talk to the cops, he's dead.
Dean, if you're son is in danger, then you need to tell us what you know.
I went to pick him up after practice.
When he wasn't at the usual spot,
I figured he must have walked home.
When I got back to my apartment, that phone was on my doormat.
It had a text on it.
"We have your son.
Tell no one.
Use only this phone."
Contact the police, and Tyler dies."
"Stand by.
We will tell you where to go and what to do.
Tell no one.
Your son's life depends on it."
What do they want from you?
I have no idea.
Dean's Glock is a 9 millimeter.
Right make, wrong model.
Lightbulb Len was killed with a .45.
The SIM card from his cell phone is a burner, and the text messages aren't coming from another phone.
They're coming from an Internet texting service based in the Ukraine- no I.P. Address, untraceable.
Track the SIM.
I want a printout of every text message.
And get the electronic serial number off that phone.
I want to find out where it was purchased and by whom.
You got it, sir.
What do they want from you?
Are they after a ransom?
Are you kidding?
I'm 40 grand in debt after my divorce.
I'm looking up at broke.
What about your ex-wife's new husband?
He has money.
They're not calling him.
They're calling me.
What if they find out I'm here?
I just want my son back.
Then your best option is to work with us.
Let us help you.
I need to get some air.
Look, I know that this is hard.
But you have to trust us.
We will find him.
Okay.
Don't let 'em hurt my boy.
Where is he?
Where is Tyler?
You should've been there to pick him up at soccer practice!
We're doing everything we can.
This is why I should've never agreed to joint custody.
It's gonna be all right.
Stay outta this.
You're not family.
He's my boy, too!
Sit down!
That's enough!
Now I need everyone to calm down, cooperate, and think.
Dean, you notice anyone unusual hanging around your son, anything out of the ordinary going on in his life?
No.
I mean, I...
I don't think so.
What about you two?
Nothing comes to mind.
No.
Now this abduction was clearly planned.
So the kidnapper had to know where Tyler was gonna be.
Sir, this is a message.
It's from the kidnapper.
There's a video attached.
Hi, dad.
I know you're worried, but I'm okay.
They say if you do what they ask, everything will be fine.
Just don't go to the police.
I'll see you soon, and don't forget to feed Ace.
Oh, thank God he's alive.
There's a time stamp on it...
1:31 A.M.
That was sent eight minutes ago.
It's a good thing, Mrs. Lefcourt.
It's called a proof of life video.
The kidnapper sent it to prove your son's alive, and that you do exactly what they ask.
Okay.
You will do exactly what they ask you to.
Do you understand?
Wait.
Play that last part again.
Don't forget to feed Ace.
Who's Ace?
I don't know any Ace.
We don't have any pets.
He's sending us a message.
He's a smart boy.
Uh, Ace could refer to a person or a business.
Sir, there's another text.
"680 Canal Street. 30 minutes."
That's the building where I work.
What's there, a jewelry store, a bank?
No, just offices.
Well, why you?
What's so special about that building that they need you?
Uh...
Oh, God.
Because I have elevator access to all the floors in the building.
You're a human key.
Sir, I just talked to the building's owner.
He's e-mailing blueprints and a tenant list for 680 Canal, including the secure floors.
Ryan and
Esposito are with me.
We'll take Dean to the building.
I've arranged to have an E.S.U. team standing by in striking distance.
Sir, you can't take Dean to that building.
It is way too dangerous.
He's a father who loves his son.
You're not gonna be able to stop him.
And until we find the boy, we don't have any other choice.
Scrub the video.
Look for anything that could lead us to him.
Yes, sir.
All right.
We're a block away.
We'll be able to see and hear everything that's happening, okay?
And we cloned your phone so we'll be able to read your texts in real time.
You follow the kidnapper's instructions to the letter.
No cowboy stuff, you understand me?
Yes.
Hi, dad.
I know you're worried, but I'm okay.
They say if you do what they ask, everything will be fine.
Just don't go to the police.
I'll see you soon, and don't forget to feed Ace.
There are no identifying markers in the background.
It's all black.
I don't know if we're gonna find him in time.
The video was taken at 1:31 A.M.
But they didn't send it till 1:39.
Yeah, well, sometimes it takes a while for a text to go through.
Yeah, but eight minutes?
You want Dean to do something for you.
You make a proof of life video.
But you wait eight minutes to send it.
Why?
Well, maybe there wasn't a signal or not enough bars.
Yeah.
Maybe they had to walk a long way to get a signal.
Maybe they were under a...
Underground.
"Ace.
" It's not "Ace."
It's A-C-E...
The A, C, and E subway lines.
They're holding Tyler in the subway.
He must have spotted a sign.
There's half a dozen stations where the A, C, and E stop.
That's too many to search.
Yeah, but the last stop for all three lines is on Canal Street and West Broadway.
That's...
Right under Dean's building.
They've been holding him under everyone's nose.
Let's go.
Check every room on the east end of the station.
You guys, check ticket booths on both ends.
Go.
Right.
Got it.
Castle, what are you thinking?
The only reason to keep him here is for a quick getaway, which is helped by the fact that 680 Canal Street has its own entrance to the subway.
If it were me...
I'd keep close enough to hook up with my partners but far enough that I would be out of the way.
Which means he's holding Tyler on the west end of the tunnel.
West end of the tunnel?
This room.
All right.
You should stay back.
No chance.
"Go to the 37th floor now."
They said 30 minutes.
It hasn't been 30 minutes yet.
They're changing the timetable in case you went to the cops.
What's on the 37th floor?
Nothing.
It's vacant.
It's not even secure.
Try Beckett.
Nothing.
It's going straight to voice mail.
She must already be in the subway.
I gotta go.
Remember, we can see and hear everything.
Anything goes south, a hundred cops will be on you inside a minute.
Not until you find my son.
Just my luck.
Pulled graveyard tonight.
All right.
He's in.
Not bad with the guard.
Guy's all right.
Camera and mic are all good.
Whoa.
Take us to the 39th floor.
I want to see Tyler first.
Just follow instructions.
You'll see him soon enough.
What's on the 39th floor?
A financial firm...
Breskin Wright.
37 was just a staging area.
They let him see their faces.
As soon as they get what they came for, they're gonna kill him.
Just like Lightbulb Len.
Beckett's still going to voice mail.
Castle, too.
Sir... what do you want to do?
If we go in before we find the kid, we might lose 'em both.
Beckett.
One armed and the kid.
If I go in, he'll kill him before I get a shot off.
He's holding a flashlight.
If we kill the ambient light, he'll light up like a Christmas tree.
We just...
It's like it's meant to be.
Maybe Lenny can prevent another tragedy.
On my count.
Three, two...
One.
Hit P-1.
The subway.
I did what you asked.
Now where's Tyler?
You'll see him in a minute.
Sorry, Dean.
Last stop.
Lobby.
We're supposed to go to subway level.
Why are we stopping at the lobby?
Don't look at me.
No, look at me.
I suggest you drop your weapons.
Where's Tyler?
The ringleader was Robert Kincaid...
Former bond trader.
He's the one who planned the entire operation.
The economy might have collapsed, but he was still gonna get his payday.
Most of them were ex wall streeters.
They knew that they needed a biometric clearance in order to get on secure floors, and they knew that Dean wasn't gonna help them, so they took Tyler as leverage.
But all they took were files.
Financial files, containing unpublished earnings reports.
To a savvy investor, they'd be worth millions.
Would've worked, too, if Lightbulb Len hadn't have been taking pictures in the park.
Mm.
He helped catch his own killer.
And foiled a kidnapping.
It's kind of poetic...
In an unspeakably tragic sort of way.
Mm.
The guy you shot in the subway?
The thug Kincaid hired to do his dirty work.
He just confessed to kidnapping Tyler, murdering Lightbulb Len, and no surprise, he ratted out Kincaid in two seconds flat.
Oh.
Speaking of rats...
I-I gotta...
I gotta go.
I'm the worst person in the whole world.
No, you're not.
You're wonderful, and you're kind, and you're sweet.
I'm a rat killer.
You don't know that.
You may just be a loser.
A-a rat loser.
This did not come out right.
Look...
If he cares, he'll understand.
Yeah, he'll understand, all right.
When he sees me in the halls at school, he'll think, there's the awful girl that lost my best friend.
It's him.
Hi.
Hi.
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
W-what's wrong?
It's about Theodore.
When I fed him, he must have got out of his cage, and...
And he's gone.
He's gone?
We looked everywhere.
I swear.
We've turned this whole place upside down.
How'd he get out?
I must not have locked the cage right.
Ashley, I'm so sorry.
You have every right to hate me.
Come on, Alexis.
I...
I'm...
I'm upset, but I don't hate you.
You don't?
I mean, no, look at this place.
Look at what you did to try to get him back.
Who else would do that?
You cared about him a lot.
Yeah, but...
I care about you more.

I'm an evo, too.
But for some reason, I'm
Different than the others.
Instead of my nanites turning
Me into a rampaging monster, I
Control them, tell them what to
Do.
That means I can do things like

We will follow shortly.
Five years ago on this very spot
Is where it all began, rex --
The so-called "nanite event."
The dream to create microscopic
Machines became real.
Some were too eager to see the
Fruits of their labor and,
Against the wishes of the wisest
Of their number, inadvertently
Gave birth to a new age.
[ whirring ]
And a violent birth it was.
That day, everything changed.
The evos were born.
rex:
That'srealinteresting
And all, but does it have
Anything to do with me?
vankleiss:[chuckles]
It has everytng to do with
You, rex.
Now...
Lets see what all this fuss
About you is, shall we?

Male announcer:
The economy is going through tough times.
Many hardworking Americans blame wealthy CEOs, out of touch with what's going on in their own companies.
But some bosses are willing to take extreme action to make their businesses better. each week, we follow the boss of a major corporation as they go undercover into their own company.
- Patrick.
How are you?
- Nice to meet you, Patrick.
This week, 1-800-flowers, the world's largest florist and gift shop.
At the helm of this floral empire are two brothers.
Get your foot off my table.
And one of them has something to prove.
Jim still sees me as his little brother.
- Where did you grow up?
- Where did I grow up?
I grew up here in this business.
I am his partner in this business.
I need to remind him of that.
He'll pose as a new recruit and find out what's really going on inside their company.
We lost air pressure so...
I was losing air pressure too.
It's, like, I don't want to make this one again.
Having people who are frustrated is the worst thing a business can have.
Let's step it up a notch.
The two brothers will go head-to-head.
What's he doing?
Is he working?
You can tell me.
Let me do my job, okay?
Let me take care of this.
And for the first time ever, the boss is forced to blow his own cover.
I don't know.
But you look familiar.
Find out what happens on the dramatic, season finale of undercover boss.
Undercover boss 1x09 1-800-flowers original air date on April 11, 2010
Headquartered in Carle Place, New York, 1-800-flowers is the world's largest florist and gift shop, selling gift baskets, cookies, and chocolates.
Running this billion dollar business are two brothers, founder and CEO Jim McCann and his younger brother Chris.
I'm Chris McCann.
My brother started this business in 1976 with one small flower shop on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
1984, he had 12 flower shops here in the New York metropolitan area.
Jim sat down and he told me I had to go help him.
It wasn't what I planned on doing.
My intent was to be a lawyer.
But I gave it a shot because he convinced me that we could grow something big.
We went public in 1999, and we've been growing ever since.
And it's unfortunate that both my father and my mother both died at a relatively early age.
So we often sit and talk about the regret we have that our parents really didn't see the success we've had and how proud my father and my mother both would've been of us.
It's a shame that they left us so early.
Jim is the CEO of our business.
As such, he's the personality of our business.
He's the front man.
So I think it would be very difficult for Jim to go undercover.
He's been doing our commercials since 1992.
It's easy to give someone that warm, fuzzy feeling with gifts under $30.
Myself, I focus on the day-to-day operations of our business.
I'm the nuts and bolts guy of the company.
I'm getting together with Joe tomorrow and, uh, I'll take a look at it there.
Jim's ideas and mine are always two very different things.
He has a really good organizational skill.
He--he approaches problems in a very pragmatic kind of way.
I'll be less pragmatic and tend to focus on what--the--the dream of what it can be.
Today I thought we'd do something a little different as I forewarned you.
Hopefully Jim and I meet somewhere in the middle.
For all the years we've been working together,
Jim still sees me as his little brother.
Get out of here.
But I am his partner in this business.
And sometimes I think I need to remind him of that.
Jim has asked me to go undercover.
I'm really looking forward to the opportunity to make sure I understand this business as well as I think I do because I want to run this company one day.
That's my plan.
Morning, Phyllis.
I'm just checking in with my brother before I head out to do my undercover mission.
You look even fuzzier than I do.
You like that?
You like that look?
It's different.
Get your foot off my table.
- Where did you grow up?
- Where did I grow up?
I grew up here in this business.
So how do you feel about your expedition here?
I think it's gonna be great.
What are you dreading the most?
The aspects of the business that I don't know as well.
'Cause you're not as comfortable.
Right.
I'm not as comfortable.
So if I get in and work in the chocolate factory,
I don't know that business.
I can't wait to Sp-- to spy in on you along the way.
I-I-I don't want you spying in along the way.
You do enough of that as it is.
You know, Chris is competitive.
He and I sometimes compete on things and have a interesting rivalry.
I think he's concerned that I've always been his boss.
He acts like I'm not.
But I have to every once in awhile remind him.
Have fun, get me some great stories that I can really make fun of you about, but enjoy it too.
- Great.
- Do good.
- I look forward to it.
- All right, bud.
Ah, stop.
Ah, come on.
All right.
Do well.
Yeah.
While undercover, I'll be Patty O'Reilly, an out-of-work house-painter traveling with a television crew making a show about entry-level jobs.
I'm at our store in South Plainfield, new Jersey.
Today, I'll be working with one of our designers here.
When a customer orders an arrangement online or comes into one of our stores, our designers are the ones who make the arrangements come to life.
They are the lifeblood of our stores.
And I need to make sure their creativity really comes through.
Because without their skills, we don't have anything to sell.
- Hey, Pauline.
- Yes.
- Hi.
I'm Patrick.
- Hi, Patrick.
Patrick.
Pat.
Pattie.
Whatever you want to call me, huh?
Okay.
Let me give you an apron.
Okay.
Thanks.
I am dreading working as a designer.
It will pull on a skill set that I know I don't have.
What is your job here in this store?
I am a designer.
I've been a designer for years.
I'm the one that makes the arrangements.
I can make any of these arrangements.
I've made Teddy bears out of flowers.
Cheeseburgers.
You name it, I can be done.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
- Creative.
- Yes, very.
This is our spring 2010 products.
- You come up with these?
- No.
I'd love to.
- Who does?
- I have no b--no clue.
Somebody in corporate does it.
Okay.
All right.
Cool.
I need to make 15-20 arrangements for deliveries going out today.
Okay.
Just cover up the oasis.
Work your way all the way around.
- Up high or down low?
- Down low.
I'm actually gonna cut some of those pieces for you just to give you a little bit of an edge.
About twice as long as you, but I'm there.
Just try and relax.
Have fun with it.
No, you still got two more.
Look.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Try and keep pace with you.
Just cut 'em.
Shorter.
Shorter.
Couple pieces around the side and then one in the center.
Okay.
This one needs to be more in the center.
- How fast was I now?
- That was better.
- Right here?
- Uh, yeah.
- Put it over there too?
- Yeah.
All right, let's put this off to the side.
And that makes 20 arrangements done, right?
Yes.
Pauline, how do you think I'm doing?
Struggling, very much so.
Patrick, he's trying.
But I don't think he would last in this business.
Sounds like you love doing the design work itself.
I absolutely love it because you help people bring a little bit more joy to that happy occasion.
Sunflowers are my favorite flowers.
Why?
'Cause they just make you smile.
You got the yellow and the orange.
It's, like, "look at me, I'm Thanksgiving.
Don't you want some Turkey and some stuffing?"
Does this--what we're making have a name?
This one is called "tickle pink."
I love these names.
You know, when they first come out, they're, like, "oh, this one's gonna be fun.
I can't wait to make that one."
And then after your, like, hundredth, it's, like, "I don't want to make this one again."
There is one arrangement, it's called "lots of love."
And it's been here since I've been here-- since 1997.
And now it's, like, they need to retire it and come out with something new.
Something different.
1-800-flowers is outdated.
Not saying to step away from the "old school" arrangements, but let's step it up a notch.
There's design shows just like any other industry has.
Right.
And I try and go because it's not just floral design anymore, it's more floral art.
Instead of a wristlet for, like, the prom, you're actually making a bracelet with flowers on it.
- With flowers?
- Yeah.
Are some products too old?
Do they need to be spruced up a little bit?
Maybe she's right.
When I go to the different shows to get some new ideas, I pay for it out of my pocket.
Your boss doesn't pay for you to do that?
No.
So what kind of ongoing training do you get from the company?
Nothing.
I've talked to people that I know in corporate and asked them why and never really got, like, a true, full answer.
I was dumbfounded when she said,
"no, there is no training."
That's our job as a franchiser is to provide training programs.
They exist.
They're available.
We need to make sure that people are aware of them because having people who are frustrated is the worst thing a business can have.
West via here.
Beautiful.
- Perfect.
- Okay.
All right, so that's basically it for today.
- I appreciate your help.
- Not a problem.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
The--the whole training thing-- her being unaware that we have these training programs, these design councils that she can participate in is very, very frustrating.
We have good programs.
I got to make sure people are aware of it.
Coming up,
Chris finds out the chocolate factory can be bittersweet.
Oh, jeez.
I got to get Nicki.
Nic!
Nicole!
And later, he's forced to break his cover.
Hey, Steven.
Recognize me?
Chris?
Chris McCann, president of 1-800-flowers, pay gym, cable, utility and other monthly bills is undercover, trying out entry-level jobs in his own company.
Today, he's at the Fannie may plant where chocolate is produced and distributed around the country.
I'm here at our Fannie may plant.
This gives me an opportunity to get in and really understand the chocolate business from a different perspective than I've seen it so far in the several years since we've owned Fannie may.
- Hi.
- Patty O'Reilly.
How are you?
- How are you?
- I'm good.
Thanks.
Um...
So I'm supposed to start with you.
Okay.
I have some shirts that you can put on and a hair net-- I'll show you where it's at.
Okay.
Thanks.
So the machine I actually run is called an enrober.
A what?
- It's called an enrober.
- Okay.
Essentially what it does is it enrobes the candy with chocolate.
We happen to be doing peanut butter pretzels today.
Right now, this plant produces about 10 million pounds of chocolate per year.
All right.
I need to make sure that we can ramp that up to anywhere between 16 and 20 million pounds per year.
And then we just make our way down to the bottom where they are coming off the line and they're being bulked.
We're gonna let you try to do this for a few minutes, see how it goes.
When this box gets full, you just slide it, you close it, and then you stick it on a skid.
- Okay.
- You put a bag in a shipper.
- All right.
- You're gonna come over here.
Grab the tapper.
You want these all the way full to the top 'cause these weigh 30 pounds and we like to keep the weight consistent.
Now you need to slide this.
The whole thing.
The whole key to this is making sure you get another box made before this one gets too full 'cause otherwise it will be quite a mess.
And then the whole process starts over again.
But, see, now you got too full.
So what'll happen?
So we'll have to move a little bit faster.
Okay.
So now the only problem is now I need to go back up to the top.
Okay.
You're gonna leave me, huh?
Because we're out of something.
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
I'll be here.
Uh, just barely keeping pace here.
This thing moves fast.
I'm always pushing the manager here.
"How can we increase our productivity line on a dollar, dollar fifty per pound.
And certainly, I'm not helping when I'm taping boxes like this one here.
I got to double back now and get this one.
Jesus.
So, pat, we lost air pressure.
So all the belts run on air.
I was losing air pressure too.
So we'll have a few minutes.
We were 1,000 pounds behind when I started.
So, uh, we got some catching up to do.
But what's great is, she says "we'll be doing the paperwork
"and we'll chart where we are on our productivity
"and then we'll know whether or not maybe that belt will be get turned up a little bit."
It sounds like I'm back on.
Whew.
Uh, it's hectic.
You run against the clock.
You got this thing--this machine's gonna back you up.
Oh, jeez.
Can't slow down for a minute.
And I got chocolate falling out of the boxes left and right and the floor is a mess.
I got to get Nicki.
Nic!
Nicole!
Oh, jeez.
- How's it going, pat?
- Uh, it's hectic.
How's it going?
You need something?
I'm gonna need a little hand catching up here.
You're doing fine.
Just put that box over there.
On that skid.
I'll get it.
Don't worry about it.
I got my job done, but I was frantic doing it.
And I found Nicole to simply be calm.
Her manner in the way she would work with me to say
"it's okay, I'll give you a hand here.
We'll catch you up a little bit."
Great managerial skill.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- It's a little fast, huh?
- Yeah.
Usually we do 1100 pounds an hour.
Takes awhile to get used to.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Who sets the, uh, numbers you're talking about, you?
I don't know who does it.
They don't consult you on that?
No.
They don't consult us.
How do they know what we can handle?
My opinion is I think they look at, like, the paperwork at the end of the day and they see how much we ran so they know what we're capable of.
The people from the office, pat, that make these goals, they never come out to see how hard we have to work.
- They don't?
- No.
Never.
It would be nice though, right?
So they could see--they could see how fast you're working.
I'm surprised you don't get involved in setting the goals.
I--yeah.
I don't know.
So you want to see what we just did?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay what?
- 1260.
- Yeah!
That's good, right?
For your first time.
Yeah.
If the goal was 1050, we picked up a little bit there, right?
We did pick up a lot, actually.
So if you're hitting goal and if it gets raised, do you get incentive for that?
No, I don't get any incentive.
I need to put some pretzels in the hopper.
- Okay.
- It gave you a workout.
It did.
When Nicole said to me that the bosses never really come down there and--and--and speak to her about what's going on or--or engage and ask questions, I felt angry and frustrated that it doesn't happen.
I thought we were doing that.
We should be doing that.
That's the way Jim built our company.
And listening to people who are doing the work, that's how we learn.
For Chris' next undercover job, he travels to Boston, Massachusetts.
For the last few years, we've been focused on building our Internet business.
But I've come here to work undercover to make sure that I can reconnect with our stores.
'Cause that's where the brand comes to life.
I've come to one of our top performing stores in the nation.
I wanted to find out what makes this store so successful.
So that we can bring that to all of our stores.
Hi, Dee.
I'm pat.
How are you?
- Hi, Patrick.
- Nice to meet you.
- How are you?
- Very good.
Nice to meet you too.
Come on in.
You can hang your coat back there.
And if you have any questions for me--
- I'll have lots.
- Okay.
Good.
So what we'll do is I'll show you how to cut.
Okay.
Good.
Whatever you need me to do.
All right.
You just cut these just straight across?
- Mm-hmm.
At an angle, rather.
- Is this good, Dee?
- Very good.
- Okay.
How long have you been here?
This store opened two years ago in January.
I've been here since.
Mm-hmm.
But I've been doing this 25 years.
- Oh, is that right?
- Mm-hmm.
Long time.
It's, like, a family shop, you know?
That's great.
- Hi, Dee.
- Hi, guys.
This is my boyfriend.
Let me say good morning.
Good morning, sweetheart.
I think I want that one.
- You like this one?
- You like that one?
Do you--am I gonna get my hug?
Oh, thank you, love.
So you come in here all the time?
Yeah.
Yeah, we love it here.
This is the only flower shop we go to.
I mean, the kids come in here and they love it.
Dee's so friendly.
I mean, we have had other florists here, but they just don't have the knack that Dee does.
- How are you?
- Oh, hi.
How are you?
So how are you?
That's Melinda.
She's picking up...
- Corsages?
- Oh, that's perfect.
- Okay?
Small enough?
- Yeah, that's great.
Okay.
Good.
You build up a lot of relationship with your customers, it looks like.
These people are coming to my home.
So I want them to be treated like they're at my home.
She's fantastic.
The connection that she has with her customers-- if I could bottle that and get into that-- into all of our stores, oh, my God.
Got it?
- Hello.
- Hello.
Patrick, this is my boss.
This is Steven, the gm.
Steven, this is, uh, a new guy that is gonna be working with us.
- How are you?
- I'm good.
How are you?
Good.
Nice to meet you.
I'm a bit worried because I've met this guy before.
He can blow my cover.
I think he's, uh, suspicious.
Uh, this is, uh, this is not good right now.
I'll just stay in the corner here for a few minutes and hope that--hope this guy doesn't interact with me.
Okay, Patrick, I'm gonna send you with Steven to do this delivery.
- Hey, Steven.
- Very good.
Recognize me?
You--you sure?
Chris?
Yeah.
I'm undercover right now going around to our businesses trying to figure out how we can do things better.
- Uh-huh.
So I need you to keep this confidential.
- I will.
No problem.
- This is extremely important.
- No problem.
- All right.
Let's go make this delivery.
You turn it because you're crushing the flowers.
- Okay.
- There you go.
I was very nervous when he was here.
I didn't want him to all of the sudden turn around and say, "I know you."
So it was good that I was able to pull him aside and make sure he doesn't blow this.
So, Patrick, you notice that you go and you bring back an old one, right?
Yeah, yeah.
So I switch it off every week.
That's-- that's nice business.
Patrick, you're all done for today.
You did a great job.
Great.
- So I will talk to you soon.
- Well, thank you very much.
It was good to see you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
Nice working with you.
Thanks for the help.
I appreciate it.
You're very welcome.
Dee is a perfect living example of what my brother always says:
Build a relationship first, do business second.
One thing I really admire about Jim is his ability to understand people and connect with people very quickly.
And that's why this opportunity is so great for me to really understand people at different levels of our company.
It's something I constantly work on improving.
Today brought it all home for me.
I need to make sure that people can connect with me if I'm going to be their leader.
Coming up, Chris gets a surprise visitor that pushes him to the edge.
Let me do my job, okay?
Let me take care of this.
Chris McCann, a boss undercover in his own company, is finding out that the frontline jobs are a lot tougher than he anticipated.
Nic!
Nicole!
Chris's undercover journey continues at a flower shop in Massachusetts.
Today, I'm at one of our stores.
I'm going to find out how we service this local community, because this community's going to be different than the store I was in yesterday.
I need to find out how we adapt to the local customer.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm pat.
I'm Sheryl.
- Hey, Sheryl.
Nice to meet you.
- You too.
How are you today?
Good.
A little chilly.
- Yeah, a little.
- You're gonna train me?
- I certainly am.
- Very good.
I could use it.
- Wanna take your coat off?
- Please.
What I'm gonna do first, is I'm gonna just process some flowers.
Okay.
Pull 'em out.
Why don't you take that?
Sure.
Right into the back.
How are you?
Good.
What type of flowers do we need today?
Okay, do you want cut flowers wrapped up?
- Wrapped up would be good.
- Wrapped up.
Usually I order on the phone.
I don't usually come into the store.
You're new.
It's been only here for a few months.
No, no, no, no.
We opened actually last February.
Oh, really?
Have you been here since then, Sheryl?
I have.
I actually went down and I worked in the design center to see what the company was all about.
Then I came here as the manager when it was opening.
Have you guys been real busy?
Um, it depends.
Honestly, I just gotta get people to realize what 1-800-flowers is.
'Cause they think it's only online.
How many people come in here and think that there's just operators sitting in here.
Maybe the sign could be a little bit larger or something like that.
Ah, we gotta figure out something.
That looks nice.
Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.
That was fast too.
Design center, they train you to do this?
No, no, no, I've been in this business for many years.
Have you?
Yeah, I actually owned my own flower shop for about 13, 14 years.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yep.
All right.
Well, we'll see you again for sure.
Have a great afternoon.
I'm going in the back, and I'm gonna make up some arrangements, so just clean up.
Okay.
Call me if you need me.
This oughta be interesting.
I would have liked a little more customer activity.
I have to figure out how I can help her get the customers in the door.
There's something wrong there.
What time of day is your busiest time of day, Sheryl?
It's not real busy all day long any day.
And even there's some days
I--we're-- there's nothing.
Totally different from what I've ever been used to.
Like I said, I owned my own flower shop, and it wasn't that hard to get them, as hard as it is because of the name.
Why would that be?
'Cause of this area.
I mean, this is a very ritzy neighborhood.
This is old money, lots of money.
I had a woman one day come in here and say,
"you know, I'd really wish you'd change your name
"'cause I can't buy anything here, and I love your stuff."
And I said, "well, why couldn't you buy it?"
She says, "'cause I cannot send something out to my friends that say that."
Getting people educated on what this store is has been hard.
Once I can convince them, let them know who I am,
I can win them over.
So how do you do that?
Talking to them.
Other than that, nothing.
'Cause we haven't done any advertising or anything for this store.
We haven't gotten into the neighborhoods to let them know that we're here.
People don't even know there's a flower shop here.
There's so used to driving by and thinking it's a dry cleaners.
So they think this is a dry cleaner?
They think it's still a dry cleaner.
Wow.
It can't take a year for people to think it's still the old shop that was here.
But she's right, the advertising we do is all about driving customers online.
I have to do right by Sheryl.
She needs my support, and I'm going to make sure she gets it.
So very easy store to close up.
All right, thank you.
- Nice meeting you.
- Thank you very much.
Night, Sheryl.
Bye-bye.
Good night.
One of the things Sheryl spoke about was the challenge that she has in getting people to realize that the 1-800-flowers store is a local florist.
That hurts me, because we grew up as florists.
We are florists.
With people like Sheryl who know the business so well, once we get them interacting with the customers, that will change, but that hurts to hear.
I'm going into this store to FD out:
Do we have a younger generation of people that I can count on to grow our business over the next ten years?
How you doing?
Looking for Jose.
- Yeah, I'm Jose.
- You're Jose?
- Yeah.
- Patrick.
How are you?
Nice to meet you, Patrick.
You were gonna train me today?
- Okay, yes, no problem.
- Okay, good.
You can stack these here going this way.
How long you been working here?
How old are you?
I'm 19.
Nice, nice.
Yeah, it was pretty tough, but it was a good experience.
Get everything nice and sweeped up.
Watch your feet, Lou.
Coming behind you.
Thank you so much.
- Does this look good?
- Yeah, that's good.
Yeah.
I don't know, but you look familiar.
You know, the other flower shop in Bethpage?
- Nah.
- No?
This is my first one.
Oh, okay.
I relish the opportunity of not being recognized, getting in there and working with them side by side, kidding around, learning a little bit more about them as people, what they think of the company.
I just hope I didn't lose that now, the rest of the day.
Thank you for calling 1-800-flowers in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.
How may I help you today?
Good morning.
My name is Yanique.
I'm calling from 1-800-flowers headquarters.
I'm looking for the manager.
Yes, you're speaking to him.
I was just informed by someone on my staff that Jim McCann, the CEO and founder of 1-800-flowers, is actually in your area, and he would like to stop by the store.
Okay, no problem.
You got it, ma'am.
All right, thank you so much.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Bye-bye.
Just try to keep it nice and neat.
The CEO, Jim McCann, he's gonna be stopping in by today to check the store.
Yeah, okay, I can understand
Jim wanting to come and check on what's going on.
But he coulda called me.
He coulda just hooked up with me later.
Let me do my job, okay?
Let me take care of this.
This is the first time he's stopped in the store.
Yeah.
I've seen him in the commercials.
He's gonna talk to me and stuff like that.
Yeah.
So it's like we're gonna meet a celebrity.
Like, he's famous.
Keep everything neat.
Okay.
So when he comes in, he sees everything's spotless.
You know what you can do also, um,
Patrick, like, see the garbage here?
Clean the top a little and kinda straighten that up a little more straight.
- Organize it?
- Yeah, organize it.
Okay, let me just finish that, and then I'll do this.
You know what you can do also?
Kinda neaten up a little bit.
Just organize it?
Jose's kicking everybody, including me, into high gear now, 'cause the head honcho's coming down.
I think if they knew I was coming, they'd be sprucing up like this too.
It's just ironic that they have me doing the sprucing up.
Get this cleared for her, huh, so she can clean?
Yeah, she can clean, yeah.
I wanna make you look good for your visit.
Yeah, we wanna make it look very nice before he gets here.
Try and keep yourself busy.
All right, my man?
All right, I can do that.
I can do it.
I'm Jim McCann.
How are you?
- Hi, I'm crystal.
- Crystal?
- Yes.
- Hi.
Tania.
- Tania, how are you?
- Nice to meet you.
Is the manager around today?
He's in the back.
What's he doing?
Is he working?
You can tell me.
Yeah.
- Jim McCann?
- Yeah.
- Jose.
Nice to meet you.
- Jose?
- Yes, Jose.
- Nice to meet you.
- Heard a lot about you.
- All good, I'm hoping.
Yeah, good, yeah.
I didn't like the fact that he popped into the store like that.
He didn't consult me on that, and that annoyed me.
I was nervous.
I didn't want the cover to be blown.
Coming in was way too risky.
This is going too far.
Patrick.
Patrick, this is Jim McCann.
How you doing?
I'm Pattie.
How are you?
Oh, he's the trainee?
Yeah, he's the trainee.
- He's showing me what to do.
- He is?
Yeah, I'm showing him little basic stuff, like wrapping, sweeping up.
- It's his first day?
- Yes.
He was, like, trying to get away from me so that we wouldn't have any interaction.
So I was just trying to turn up the flames on the degree of discomfort he felt.
Yeah, yeah, I'll take the shot.
Me and Jim are totally the ones here.
- Gotta hold it or-- - hold it.
Okay.
And maybe you could have the new guy and one of the gals on the front make me a nice $100 bouquet before I go.
Sure.
It's all about the wrapping.
Let's see what the kid does.
Here you go.
Would you like, like, a bow on it?
Nope, just like that's fine.
It looks nice except he wrapped it a little too tight around the crown.
Don't you think?
Yeah, I would say, yeah.
So smack him.
Like me to loosen it up for you, Jim?
This is perfect.
Thanks, Jose.
You're the best.
Once again, it was a pleasure meeting you, Jim.
Take care, man.
It's nice to see him awkward like that, and I have all the controls.
'Cause usually he's gonna give it back, but in this case he couldn't.
I'm still angry at Jim.
But seeing him come in the store today allowed me to see firsthand how our employees really view us.
You guys have a great weekend.
Take care, Jim.
You got it.
I'm gonna buy you a slice, 'cause I'm starving.
Okay.
Oh, thanks, man.
Sure.
We'll just jump across the street here.
I appreciate your help.
Just doing my job, pat.
So how'd you wind up starting when you were so early?
Um, what it was,
I was young.
My father passed away at an early age, when I was 12.
So things was tough financially, so my mom, she was struggling with bills and stuff.
So I started looking for a part-time job, and I tried here one day for an application and they hired me the next week after they called me.
I started, just like you, taking out garbage, and they liked what they saw, and they were happy, and before you know it, they hired me.
And everything just fast-forward until now.
Yeah, a lot of bumps in the road, you know, but we pulled it all through and, you know, I'm here today.
- You still live with your mom?
- Yes.
So we struggled.
You know, you get a lot of losses before you get a win.
You know?
That's right, yeah, yeah.
I had a respect for Jose from just working with him.
And then when I realized his life story, you can't help but have the utmost respect for somebody like that.
The fact that he went out and got a job at such a young age to support his family is just unbelievable.
Listening to the story of Jose and him losing his father reminds me so much of when I lost mine.
The day I lost my father,
I remember very well.
My father had just gone through the third operation for esophageal cancer.
He didn't think he could do it.
And I sat there and spoke to him one time and told him he had to do it because he always taught me you never give up, you never quit.
And so he didn't quit.
He fought it.
And I'm very proud that he didn't.
And I'll take that to the grave with me.
As long as I live, I will never quit.
Coming up, Chris stands up to his older brother.
What was that?
I'm like, "I'm trying to avoid you."
And later, he summons his employees to headquarters and reveals his true identity.
I'm Chris McCann,
Now my week of undercover work is done, and I'm going to report back to my brother and tell him about everything that I learned.
I got you good.
What was that?
And then, "come here, get in the picture, get in the picture."
I'm like, "I'm trying to avoid you."
What a week.
What I learned is I'm looking to take this company to the next evolution of growth.
We have such great people in these jobs, and we have to make sure we give them the support mechanisms to really turn it into the next stage.
You know, I was with a lady up in the north end in Boston.
Kids coming in to give her presents.
Moms stopping by.
It's like our first shop on first Avenue.
Brings back memories.
It brings back memories to where it started.
We never get away from that.
That's what it's all about.
But I don't know if I'm coming back.
This is too good.
How do you think this changes your standing in the company?
I've prided myself on being close to the business.
And you and I spoke as I started this journey, right, that it was nothing I couldn't do.
Well, I learned I couldn't pack a bowl with chocolate.
And you've said this all the time.
The main thing is your success starts with good people.
So it sounds to me like you learned some interesting lessons this week.
There's a lot.
Now, I need some things to change.
I need you to trust me.
I'm your little brother, but I'm running the company, okay?
Well...
I'm very excited.
Now is the time I get to reveal my true identity to the employees
I've worked with for the last week.
Well, I'm a little nervous.
Totally clueless at this point.
Very confused right now.
I have no idea why I'm here or what I'm doing.
- Hi, Dee.
- Patrick.
Oh.
Pat.
- Hi, Patrick.
- So you remember me, huh?
I do.
I'm not Patrick O'Reilly.
- No?
- I'm Chris McCann.
Oh.
I...
Like, hey, I'm just completely shocked right now.
You got me.
I said, "this guy is good around flowers."
Nicole, I have a keen awareness of how hard you work.
You saw how hard I was working.
But what was amazing was as soon as you stepped in, everything went calm.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
I take pride in it.
When you put me on the line, the first thing you told me was how much we had to make.
One of the things that I'd like to do for you, Nicole, is to make sure that you meet, when those goals are being set, with your direct managers so that you're a part of the process in setting those goals.
I really appreciate it.
I'm not done yet.
Your hard work and great attitude has inspired me to create an incentive program for you to make more money when you exceed your goals.
Well, thank you.
I appreciate it.
They'll have an incentive system in place.
Makes me feel good.
- Great.
- I'm very happy right now.
Like, I'm a little surprised, and I'm really happy that somebody's noticing that I work so hard.
Pauline, I loved working with you.
Thank you.
And I was amazed to find out you're such a talented creative designer.
You mentioned when we were looking at the collection that it would be your dream to have input to that.
Yes, absolutely.
I'm going to make that dream come true.
Really?
- Yeah.
- All right.
I have a design council who work on upcoming trends and design styles.
I'm going to set you up to spend a day training with them.
And I'd like to ask you to come up with one of our next collections, so that you now can tell all the rest of the florists that we work with that you came up with that collection.
Oh, my God.
That means the world to me, it really does, to have--to have that.
Mm-hmm.
After all these years, to be able to do that.
I can't believe it.
My dad's been gone eight years, and he helped push me to get to where I am.
And I know he's looking down on me.
And he's proud, and he's happy.
Dee, I went undercover into your store, specifically because you have one of the highest grossing stores in our system, and I wanted to find out the secret as to why.
I learned the secret.
The secret is you.
Oh, thank you.
- You're an amazing person.
- Thank you.
I was blown away by the way customers came in and said hello to you.
I was so impressed with you as a person.
And I thought to myself afterwards-- one thing we've never done in this company is to name one of our arrangements after a person.
What a great way to honor you, by naming one of the 1-800-flowers arrangements after you.
And your customers step into a little respite of paradise when they come into your shops.
So I'd like to call the arrangement "Dee's paradise."
That's beyond anything I could have imagined.
Beyond.
Oh, unbelievable.
Thank you.
You're a wonderful person.
Oh, thank you.
To have somebody think that you do such a good job that they would name a flower after you, that's an amazing honor.
I can't even put it into words.
That's all I'm gonna say.
It's amazing.
Sheryl, you spoke a lot about the biggest challenge you have in that shop.
The public thinks that just 1-800-flowers is just the Internet thing.
And that's what we need to address, and I share your frustrations.
As you said, once you get people in the door, once you get people to know you, their perception changes.
How could they not by meeting such a person like yourself?
Thank you.
I want them to see you for the florist that IOU really are.
I'd like to ask you to work with some of my best local store marketing people.
Let's come up with a plan.
I'm overwhelmed.
I--I thank you for the opportunity.
Thank you, Sheryl.
I've never had anybody just recognize me for what...
I have to offer.
I'm gonna pop.
I'm gonna explode.
When I went into your store, Jose,
I was looking to see:
Where are the new, younger generation of leaders of our company going to come from?
Well, I'm thrilled to say I think I found it.
Wow.
One of the things I don't know if you're aware of we have in our company is called a mentorship program.
It assigns generally younger people to someone who has a little bit more experience, and that role is to mentor that person.
I would be privileged and honored if you would allow me to be your mentor.
I'm not-- I'm not sure what to say.
I think working together, I'm pretty confident that you'll become our youngest franchise owner in the history of the company.
Wow.
And to get a franchise does require money.
There are fees involved, there's start-up cost.
When the time comes, and you're qualified, and you're ready to start that process, you can count on the first $25,000 coming from me.
I'm--
I feel like this is a dream right now.
I'm pretty shocked.
I'm only 19, and this is the most-- the biggest thing to happen in my life ever.
I don't know what to say.
I feel like I can't breathe, and this is great.
It's fantastic, and I can't wait till I tell my mom.
I can't believe it, mom, that was Jim McCann's brother, mom.
It was his brother, and I was speaking to him, mom.
And he wants to be my mentor, mom.
I'm gonna open up a franchise.
Really, mom, I can't believe it, mom.
This is incredible.
This is it.
I've gathered the whole company together so that I can share with them my experiences of being undercover.
Ladies and gentlemen, my brother, Chris McCann.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm Chris McCann, and for the past week
I went undercover mainly to gain insights into our business.
And I gotta tell you, the experience was phenomenal.
Let me use some video to let you see what I've been doing for the last week.
Nic!
Nicole!
This guy's not very good at anything, huh?
Don't forget, payback can be dangerous.
This is a pretty simple arrangement.
Pauline, how do you think I'm doing?
Struggling, very much so.
Okay.
I don't think he would last in this business.
So I have to tell you it was an absolutely fantastic experience.
And I learned some great things along the way, things that we're doing so well.
But I also learned there's a lot of details that we need to pay attention to.
We, as leaders, are in a position to impact people's lives.
I am a boss of a company that's all about being thoughtful.
From this day forward, I am making the commitment to each and every one of you that I am going to be more thoughtful about you.
Thank you.
I think it's time now for you to use this as a springboard to really step up in a much bigger way.
No question.
Thank you very much.
The whole experience made me realize that it's not about proving to my brother or anyone else that I'm capable of leading this company.
It was about proving to myself that I know what's necessary to lead this company into the future.
But I'm always going to do it with a keen eye out for the people of our business.
My girlfriend won't look at me.
I could cry every minute.
We did it before.
Can we do it now?
I don't think so.
You put a kid in hospital.
I couldn't stand the way she was fucking looking at him.
I love him, Cook.
Sentence set for two weeks from today.
Take him down.
- Ready?
- Teeth?
All clear.
Right, let's get to work then.
Please, Dad, I'm too young to die.
Shut up, kid.
I'm your son, your only son.
Saml
Hiya, love.
Dare I ask what you're doing now?
Are you leading a busy lifestyle?
Not enough time for a full work-out?
Don't worry, cos Fitch Fitness has got the answer.
Yeah!
The new concept in fitness that gives you a full body work-out in just...
Five minutes!
The HyperFitch Machine!
Don't get Fitch...
Get HyperFitch!
That's great, Rob!
Any chance you could invent a moneymaking machine while you're at it?
You're looking at it, love.
Are you girls off to work?
Someone has to.
See you in a bit, yeah?
Laters, lover.
Er, Rob?
Yeah?
Where's that bolt go?
What?
Oh, shit!
- Agh!
- James!
Things are cool, aren't they, Mum?
Between you and Dad?
Of course, Katiekins!
Nothing for you to worry about.
How unreal do I look?
Amazingly unreal.
Dean is going to come in his pants when he sees me.
Brandy!
Baby!
You look unreal.
I'm sorry I'm late.
My colonic overran.
Jenna, have you talked to OK!
About covering the wedding?
Unfortunately, Vivienne, they insisted they only cover premiership do's.
Excuse me?
I mean, negotiations are still ongoing.
Wonderful.
Now, we also want a gaggle of swans, 100 doves and a trained owl.
An owl?
To bear the ring.
These will be expensive extras.
Jenna, I promised Brandy the wedding of her dreams and that is what she'll have.
I'm sure you'd want the same for Katie.
Look, I'll sort out the hen night and you just deal with the owls and stuff, OK?
Daughters, eh?
What would we do without them?
Don't know!
See you tonight, and don't forget the theme, sluts and studs.
Sluts and studs.
Well, come on then.
That's you.
Now, Katherine, your home tests were coming up correct, you're not pregnant.
Thank God!
What's up with my periods then?
Your results show that you're going through something called a premature menopause.
Oh, right.
Shit!
I can't imagine what you're feeling.
Not being able to have children...
Well, it isn't a nice thought, is it?
Especially at your age.
What are you talking about?
Katherine, the menopause prevents you from ovulating.
Which means you won't be able to conceive babies.
What?
Ever?
But there's pills for that, right?
I'm afraid not.
I know this is a lot to take in.
Would you like me to call your mum?
Well?
Have I got you knocked up?
Thank fuck!
That would totally not be awesome.
You can pretty much fuck off now.
What's with the mood, sugar titties?
Leave me alone.
Kitty Kat, stop kidding round.
Do I look like I'm kidding?
You're dumped.
Fuck off.
Broke my fucking toe.
Goodbye, Sam.
Katie!
Hi, this is Emily.
Can't come to the phone right now but leave me a message.
Bitch!
You're in the wrong account.
- No, sweetheart, I can assure you...
- Mum.
"The Fitch Fitness account has been empty... '
This has nothing to do with Fitch Fitness.
I use our family account and we are not bankrupt.
'I'm sorry about this, give me a moment to look into it.
'Do you know your password?
'
Look, you know, I don't have time for this.
I'm trying to run a business here.
So why don't you just get it on your stupid screen and sort it out?
'It says here you've been informed on numerous occasions.
- 'Have you had any letters?
'
- No, we haven't received notification.
No nothing, zilch.
'Mrs.
Fitch, you are not eligible for any more loans 'and you've exceeded your overdraft limit.'
Arsehole!
- 'Are you referring to me?
'
- No, not you.
'Hello?
'
Mum?
What are those?
Deep breaths, Jenna.
Deep breaths.
Mum?
Honey, we're home!
Mum?
Mum?
Babe, we're back.
Mum!
The nurse said that I have an unusual fascination for the female anatomy and that I should consider a career as a gyna...
Gyna...
Gyna...
What's the word, Dad?
Gynaecologist.
Something you want to tell me, Rob?
Don't you dare run away from me, don't you dare!
You stupid, stupid person.
- You bastard, you're a fucking coward.
- I was going to tell you.
- You're a fucking coward.
- It's not my fault.
We are so finished.
Consider yourself divorced.
You arsehole!
You ruined everything!
You fucking bastard!
Stupid, stupid...
What's happening?
You'll be all right.
Everything's going to be fine.
Don't you dare make out like I'm the one in the wrong.
Just calm down, love.
I'm gonna burn your "Gym of the Year" certificate.
- What?
- What's going on, Mum?
Is Dad coming back?
We'll talk about it later.
You need to concentrate on doing a good job for me tonight, OK?
We've got a lot riding on this wedding now, sweetheart.
Let me look at you.
Perfection.
Katie!
This is Candace, my BFFE.
Nice outfit!
Sorry about the change of theme.
Candy surprised us all with these.
Soz, hun.
I was going to get you one but I didn't know what to put on the back.
Another shot, Brands?
WTF, Cands.
Here we go, a toast to my new boyfriend, Danny Guillermo.
To husbands, handbags and holidays!
Danny's told me about you.
I figured you'd have bigger tits.
They're like Danny's favourite thing ever.
- He never complained.
- Not to your face.
So, you got a new man now then?
Brandy, Baby, I am paying Katie to work, not to socialise.
Sorry, Mum.
Our table is finally ready, girls.
My darling daughter has been blessed with her looks and what God didn't give her, my plastic surgeon did!
Brandy, sweetheart, beautiful...
I am so proud of you.
You've grown up to be a sexy, arousing woman.
And what with the wedding, and now the baby, you've just exceeded all my expectations.
What baby?
Mummy, it's a secret.
It's better for people to know, than think you're a fatty.
Girlies, will you please raise your glasses and toast my angel, daughter and grandchild bearer!
To Brandylicious!
Brandylicious!
Now, let's all get completely wrecked, give them paps something to print tomorrow!
Hiya, Babes.
You having a rave?
Rave and a half.
I'm so angry Mummy told everyone I got knocked up.
Yeah, I bet.
Oh, I'll have some of that.
You do know you're not supposed to drink when you're pregnant?
Don't care, and I don't think you can talk to me like that.
I'll do what I want.
You're in my way.
Move.
Katie!
What are you doing here?
You cool?
Have a drink with us.
Is that a joke?
Katie, I'm...
You haven't changed.
I can see straight through you.
Likewise.
Never going to let that smile falter?
Only when yours does.
Sweetheart, I've run out of fags.
You'll need to run along and go and get some more.
One, I'm not your fucking maid.
Two, I don't work for you, so you'll have to go and get your own fags, sweetheart.
Stupid bitch.
Rudeness!
Swallow or spit, girlfriend?
How dare she?
Who does she think she is?
Who the fuck do you think you are?
I'm Katie fucking Fitch.
Who the fuck are you?
Come on, princess, that's enough for one night.
Get off me!
Look at yourself.
You are disgusting.
You are an embarrassment.
Sack her, Mummy.
You and your useless mother are fired.
Get rid of her.
Come on, sweet cheeks, don't mess with them.
I don't smoke.
What you scared of?
Uh, cancer?
Fuck it.
Steady.
You didn't inhale properly.
Breathe in.
Now breathe in again so it goes there.
Why are you being nice to me?
Life's too short.
You are such a fucking cliche.
So what's it like?
What's what like?
Love.
Great.
It's really lovely.
That sounded convincing.
It's fine.
Nothing's ever perfect, you know?
I thought it could be.
I wanted the perfect boyfriend, perfect marriage, perfect everything.
What's changed?
Me.
I don't know who I am any more.
I thought you were Katie fucking Fitch!
I used to hide in the bath when she was angry.
I've really messed up, kiddo.
Yeah, but you love each other, right?
For richer, for poorer.
Kids... it seems that your father has let us down once again.
Jen, please.
He's been selfish and stupid.
- Mum, stop it!
- I suggest you keep shtoom, young lady, considering you've lost us the only income we had.
Because of his stupidity, this house... our home, is being taken from us.
Today.
Tell your children what that means, Rob.
It means we're homeless.
That's right, it means we're homeless because of your dad.
I tried to save the gym.
It's these loan companies, nice as pie one minute, next thing they're calling you up, sending you letters, but you gotta believe me, we're going to make a fortune out of that machine.
That machine's a total waste of space, Rob, just like you.
Take James upstairs.
But Mum...
Katie, for once, do as you're told.
How could you do this to us?
To your own children?
- Your own children?
- I'm trying to do the best I can.
Have you got any sense of responsibility?
- Have you heard of communication?
- I'm doing the best I can.
- Have you got any sense of responsibility?
- You're just like a child!
Hello?
Come on, folks.
Yes?
Good morning, sweetheart.
We're here to repossess your belongings.
Love, open up, would ya?
Come on, folks!
Don't fuck us about!
Open up, open the door.
Get your stuff.
Morning, Mr. Fitch.
Hey, lads, you're going to be reasonable, yeah?
Certainly, ain't we?
Reasonable's our middle name.
Good, ta.
Can you just read out your court order, just so I know you're not, you know...
Cunts.
Righty-oh.
"By the order of the county court, given this day, 17th of February 2010,
"it is hereby given down that goods to the value of £13,337...
"...
William M Janus and granted licence to reposse..."
Are you still there, Mr. Fitch?
Hello?
Something's not right here.
All right, my lover?
You going to open up?
I got sweeties.
Paedo!
- Move!
- Garage!
Go!
Come on, open up, you lot.
Come on, this is getting stupid now.
Right, fuck this, we're going in.
Hello?
Tell you what...
I think it's happened again.
Oh, bugger!
Oh, well.
Fuck it, can't think of everything.
Oh look!
They've got one of them there glass swans.
Where to?
My mum used to have one of those.
Oh, yeah!
This is a beauty.
It's really heavy.
Perfectly sculptured.
Look at this, bud.
You see, it's the weight of the lead that they put in the crystal, see?
Oh, feel the quality of him.
Oh, yeah, I see where you're coming from, Kev.
Might take this home for my Carol.
I promised Phil some new saucepans.
And a toaster.
You get a better quality of toaster up at this estate.
Well, you know what they're like round here, all fur coat and no knickers.
Nouveau reech, in't it?
Mind you, I wouldn't have done it out like this, would you?
I don't like that paint job at all.
Magnolia and lime?
Bollocks!
Time?
All that time when those fucking bills were coming in and you did nothing about it!
How long was that?
Cos when I looked at them
I'd say there was a good six, seven months' worth!
It takes time to sort out - you wouldn't let me deal with it!
I know you're not the sharpest tool in the box...
We're not going to sort it out here.
Get in the car!
I hate KFC.
What?
Elliot Evans's parents got divorced and his dad spent every night in KFC.
Then he met this woman and she had a huge problem, so he tried to help her, and her friend got really angry and he ended up with only one kneecap.
And now his mum's doing pornos and his dad's a junkie and he never sees them.
Except on the internet, and then he has to pay for it!
I mean, how unfair is that?
- I never thought you'd fail as a father!
- I haven't failed as a father!
You've let your kids down!
They're in the car, all that time when those fucking bills were coming in...
How long was that?
Cos when I looked...
I'm so fed up!
I can't go on like this, Rob.
I swear to God, I've had it up to here with you.
Drop me and the kids at the airport.
I'm going to my mum's.
No!
Get back in the car, Katie!
Mum, we can't afford the flights to Malaga.
We're broke!
You want to sleep with your dad on the streets?
It won't come to that!
Well, where else are we going to stay?
!
Fix it, Rob.
Or I'm getting in the car and I am leaving with the children.
There is someone we can stay with.
Who?
Good morning, Naomi.
You're looking sexy.
You heard of a shower?
What do you want?
This is difficult, OK?
But we've lost our house.
Oh, that was careless.
So what?
We need somewhere to stay.
Your house is pretty empty at the moment.
You're having a fucking laugh.
Yes, Naomi, I'm kidding that my parents have no money, no house and are about to split up.
I'm sorry, but...
It's not my problem.
Oh, but it is.
Cos it's Emily's problem.
She's your girlfriend.
That makes it your problem.
No lesbian digs?
That, I can't promise.
I'm gonna sort this.
I'll be back later.
Running away again?
He's gone to look for somewhere to live, actually.
I'm not going in there.
Please, Mum.
You've got nowhere else to go.
Please?
We've run out of cereals.
Garibaldi?
Thank you.
Look at her, swanning about as if she's done nothing wrong.
She hasn't.
I want the best for Emily, and she isn't.
How do you know?
Mums know these things.
You'll realise that one day.
Are you really going to leave Dad?
When your dad and I got married, we had nothing.
We spent years working and saving, so that you kids could have the best of everything.
And for what?
It's all gone.
I never thought we'd split up.
But then I never thought I'd be evicted from my home or that my daughter would be a so rebellious.
People always let you down, princess.
They fuck things up.
Not you, though.
Mum, I need to tell you something.
I know everything's going wrong at the moment but... it's just I went to the doctor's the other day, and...
Fuck's sake.
You could have called.
- You've been out all night.
- I know.
Can you blame me?
And now they're here.
We've got enough problems.
Stop it, Em!
All the shit she put us through, you let her march into our home.
She's your mum.
She's a selfish cow, is what she is.
Emily?
Whatever!
Stay here.
Don't expect me to care, cos I don't.
It's just for a couple of days while we get ourselves out of this pickle.
Stay out of my way.
This is my house.
I live here with my girlfriend.
And we're having a barbecue.
All right?
Whatever you say, love.
I'm going to finish emptying the car.
Wow, isn't this peachy?
Who's got any more pills?
Effy?
Don't you think you've had enough?
Don't think.
Makes life much easier.
Naomi, darling?
Got any more of your special powder?
No?
Don't, Em.
Where's Cook when you need him, eh?
Somebody phone for more pills.
Another fun day at Mrs. and Mrs. Campbell's.
Come on!
What's wrong with everyone?
Turn the music up.
Come on, you boring bastards.
Can I interest you ladies in a "cooked to perfection" burger?
Don't think so.
Hey, babes.
Did you miss me?
- D'you want me to ask everyone to leave?
- Thanks, Thomas.
What's the point?
It's all fucked anyway.
What the fuck are you doing, Emily?
Emily, fucking stop this shit now!
Naomi, darling, am I making you nice and wet?
Fuck you!
This is a fucking pantomime.
Fuck you right back.
Ems, stop it.
Stay out of this.
What?
Want to fuck her, is that it?
Maybe I do.
So what?
That's enough!
What's this all about?
It's none of your business.
I fucked the dead girl.
I fucked Sophia and gave her the drugs and now she's punishing me for it.
I knew you'd screw her up.
Hey!
Good news, everyone.
I found us a caravan.
What have I missed?
Why don't you all just fuck off?
Look at you.
Pretending to be happy families, pretending to love each other.
Don't you dare speak to me like that.
Get off your high horse.
I can't...
I can't be here any more.
Bit melodramatic.
Remind you of anyone?
Stop it!
Come on, son.
Em...
I'm coming, I've just got to...
I'll catch up with you.
See ya later!
Merde!
Sorry!
Ah!
Super merde!
JJ!
Emily!
JJ!
I think they've all gone out.
Bollocks.
You gonna stand there till they get back?
Yes, yes, I'll get you a towel and Putain!
Just sit down.
Bit of a pickle!
Do you think I'm a bitch, Thomas?
I think you are Katie.
You should always be you.
You're strong and...
I'm just too aggressive, just like my fucking mum.
I know it.
I am a bitch.
Everyone relies on you to tell the truth, Katie.
They need you.
That thing you do - is it for real?
What thing?
The lovely honourable thing.
I'm not.
I screw up so often.
Panda, college everything.
Right now I'm Monsieur Screw.
D'you fancy me?
Just checking.
Of course.
I can't have kids.
They say I can't have kids ever.
And you're sad?
You think maybe no man will ever want you?
But I am a man, and I think you're a beautiful, magnificent woman.
Panda was an idiot not to forgive you.
I was the idiot.
I wasn't honourable.
We can be friends.
Yes, I'd like that.
Me too.
Give me five minutes.
Mum?
Mum...
I can't have children.
I went to the doctor's yesterday and they said there's nothing they can do.
I wanted to tell you, but you were too busy shouting.
It's all about you.
I don't want to let you down, but you let me down.
I really needed you and you weren't there.
My baby girl.
It doesn't matter, Mum.
The house and the money.
I don't want it.
I'm not going to be you.
I just want a mum who loves me, no matter what.
I do love you, no matter what.
I'm so sorry.
And we love you, Mum.
So appreciate us.
Stop trying to push us away.
Jen.
I love you.
You stupid bastard!
I'm sorry.
They're using tongues and everything.
- Ready?
- Teeth?
All clear.
Right, let's get to work then.
Please, Dad, I'm too young to die.
Shut up, kid.
I'm your son, your only son.
Sam!
Hiya, love.
Dare I ask what you're doing now?
Are you leading a busy lifestyle?
Not enough time for a full work-out?
Don't worry, cos Fitch Fitness has got the answer.
Yeah!
The new concept in fitness that gives you a full body work-out in just...
Five minutes!
The HyperFitch Machine!
Don't get Fitch...
Get HyperFitch!
That's great, Rob!
Any chance you could invent a moneymaking machine while you're at it?
You're looking at it, love.
Are you girls off to work?
Someone has to.
See you in a bit, yeah?
Laters, lover.
Er, Rob?
Yeah?
Where's that bolt go?
What?
Oh, shit!
- Agh!
- James!
Things are cool, aren't they, Mum?
Between you and Dad?
Of course, Katiekins!
Nothing for you to worry about.
How unreal do I look?
Amazingly unreal.
Dean is going to come in his pants when he sees me.
Brandy!
Baby!
You look unreal.
I'm sorry I'm late.
My colonic overran.
Jenna, have you talked to OK!
About covering the wedding?
Unfortunately, Vivienne, they insisted they only cover premiership do's.
Excuse me?
I mean, negotiations are still ongoing.
Wonderful.
Now, we also want a gaggle of swans, 100 doves and a trained owl.
An owl?
To bear the ring.
These will be expensive extras.
Jenna, I promised Brandy the wedding of her dreams and that is what she'll have.
I'm sure you'd want the same for Katie.
Look, I'll sort out the hen night and you just deal with the owls and stuff, OK?
Daughters, eh?
What would we do without them?
Don't know!
See you tonight, and don't forget the theme, sluts and studs.
Sluts and studs.
Well, come on then.
That's you.
Now, Katherine, your home tests were coming up correct, you're not pregnant.
Thank God!
What's up with my periods then?
Your results show that you're going through something called a premature menopause.
Oh, right.
Shit!
I can't imagine what you're feeling.
Not being able to have children...
Well, it isn't a nice thought, is it?
Especially at your age.
What are you talking about?
Katherine, the menopause prevents you from ovulating.
Which means you won't be able to conceive babies.
What?
Ever?
But there's pills for that, right?
I'm afraid not.
I know this is a lot to take in.
Would you like me to call your mum?
Well?
Have I got you knocked up?
Thank fuck!
That would totally not be awesome.
You can pretty much fuck off now.
What's with the mood, sugar titties?
Leave me alone.
Kitty Kat, stop kidding round.
Do I look like I'm kidding?
You're dumped.
Fuck off.
Broke my fucking toe.
Goodbye, Sam.
Katie!
Hi, this is Emily.
Can't come to the phone right now but leave me a message.
Bitch!
You're in the wrong account.
- No, sweetheart, I can assure you...
- Mum.
"The Fitch Fitness account has been empty...'
This has nothing to do with Fitch Fitness.
I use our family account and we are not bankrupt.
'I'm sorry about this, give me a moment to look into it.
'Do you know your password?
'
Look, you know, I don't have time for this.
I'm trying to run a business here.
So why don't you just get it on your stupid screen and sort it out?
'It says here you've been informed on numerous occasions.
- 'Have you had any letters?
'
- No, we haven't received notification.
No nothing, zilch.
'Mrs.
Fitch, you are not eligible for any more loans 'and you've exceeded your overdraft limit.'
Arsehole!
- 'Are you referring to me?
'
- No, not you.
'Hello?
'
Mum?
What are those?
Deep breaths, Jenna.
Deep breaths.
Mum?
Honey, we're home!
Mum?
Mum?
Babe, we're back.
Mum!
The nurse said that I have an unusual fascination for the female anatomy and that I should consider a career as a gyna...
Gyna...
Gyna...
What's the word, Dad?
Gynaecologist.
Something you want to tell me, Rob?
Don't you dare run away from me, don't you dare!
You stupid, stupid person.
- You bastard, you're a fucking coward.
- I was going to tell you.
- You're a fucking coward.
- It's not my fault.
We are so finished.
Consider yourself divorced.
You arsehole!
You ruined everything!
You fucking bastard!
Stupid, stupid...
What's happening?
You'll be all right.
Everything's going to be fine.
Don't you dare make out like I'm the one in the wrong.
Just calm down, love.
I'm gonna burn your "Gym of the Year" certificate.
- What?
- What's going on, Mum?
Is Dad coming back?
We'll talk about it later.
You need to concentrate on doing a good job for me tonight, OK?
We've got a lot riding on this wedding now, sweetheart.
Let me look at you.
Perfection.
Katie!
This is Candace, my BFFE.
Nice outfit!
Sorry about the change of theme.
Candy surprised us all with these.
Soz, hun.
I was going to get you one but I didn't know what to put on the back.
Another shot, Brands?
WTF, Cands.
Here we go, a toast to my new boyfriend, Danny Guillermo.
To husbands, handbags and holidays!
Danny's told me about you.
I figured you'd have bigger tits.
They're like Danny's favourite thing ever.
- He never complained.
- Not to your face.
So, you got a new man now then?
Brandy, Baby, I am paying Katie to work, not to socialise.
Sorry, Mum.
Our table is finally ready, girls.
My darling daughter has been blessed with her looks and what God didn't give her, my plastic surgeon did!
Brandy, sweetheart, beautiful...
I am so proud of you.
You've grown up to be a sexy, arousing woman.
And what with the wedding, and now the baby, you've just exceeded all my expectations.
What baby?
Mummy, it's a secret.
It's better for people to know, than think you're a fatty.
Girlies, will you please raise your glasses and toast my angel, daughter and grandchild bearer!
To Brandylicious!
Brandylicious!
Now, let's all get completely wrecked, give them paps something to print tomorrow!
Hiya, Babes.
You having a rave?
Rave and a half.
I'm so angry Mummy told everyone I got knocked up.
Yeah, I bet.
Oh, I'll have some of that.
You do know you're not supposed to drink when you're pregnant?
Don't care, and I don't think you can talk to me like that.
I'll do what I want.
You're in my way.
Move.
Katie!
What are you doing here?
You cool?
Have a drink with us.
Is that a joke?
Katie, I'm...
You haven't changed.
I can see straight through you.
Likewise.
Never going to let that smile falter?
Only when yours does.
Sweetheart, I've run out of fags.
You'll need to run along and go and get some more.
One, I'm not your fucking maid.
Two, I don't work for you, so you'll have to go and get your own fags, sweetheart.
Stupid bitch.
Rudeness!
Swallow or spit, girlfriend?
How dare she?
Who does she think she is?
Who the fuck do you think you are?
I'm Katie fucking Fitch.
Who the fuck are you?
Come on, princess, that's enough for one night.
Get off me!
Look at yourself.
You are disgusting.
You are an embarrassment.
Sack her, Mummy.
You and your useless mother are fired.
Get rid of her.
Come on, sweet cheeks, don't mess with them.
I don't smoke.
What you scared of?
Uh, cancer?
Fuck it.
Steady.
You didn't inhale properly.
Breathe in.
Now breathe in again so it goes there.
Why are you being nice to me?
Life's too short.
You are such a fucking cliche.
So what's it like?
What's what like?
Love.
Great.
It's really lovely.
That sounded convincing.
It's fine.
Nothing's ever perfect, you know?
I thought it could be.
I wanted the perfect boyfriend, perfect marriage, perfect everything.
What's changed?
Me.
I don't know who I am any more.
I thought you were Katie fucking Fitch!
I used to hide in the bath when she was angry.
I've really messed up, kiddo.
Yeah, but you love each other, right?
For richer, for poorer.
Kids... it seems that your father has let us down once again.
Jen, please.
He's been selfish and stupid.
- Mum, stop it!
- I suggest you keep shtoom, young lady, considering you've lost us the only income we had.
Because of his stupidity, this house... our home, is being taken from us.
Today.
Tell your children what that means, Rob.
It means we're homeless.
That's right, it means we're homeless because of your dad.
I tried to save the gym.
It's these loan companies, nice as pie one minute, next thing they're calling you up, sending you letters, but you gotta believe me, we're going to make a fortune out of that machine.
That machine's a total waste of space, Rob, just like you.
Take James upstairs.
But Mum...
Katie, for once, do as you're told.
How could you do this to us?
To your own children?
- Your own children?
- I'm trying to do the best I can.
Have you got any sense of responsibility?
- Have you heard of communication?
- I'm doing the best I can.
- Have you got any sense of responsibility?
- You're just like a child!
Hello?
Come on, folks.
Yes?
Good morning, sweetheart.
We're here to repossess your belongings.
Love, open up, would ya?
Come on, folks!
Don't fuck us about!
Open up, open the door.
Get your stuff.
Morning, Mr. Fitch.
Hey, lads, you're going to be reasonable, yeah?
Certainly, ain't we?
Reasonable's our middle name.
Good, ta.
Can you just read out your court order, just so I know you're not, you know...
Cunts.
Righty-oh.
"By the order of the county court, given this day, 17th of February 2010,
"it is hereby given down that goods to the value of ã13,337...
"...
William M Janus and granted licence to reposse..."
Are you still there, Mr. Fitch?
Hello?
Something's not right here.
All right, my lover?
You going to open up?
I got sweeties.
Paedo!
- Move!
- Garage!
Go!
Come on, open up, you lot.
Come on, this is getting stupid now.
Right, fuck this, we're going in.
Hello?
Tell you what...
I think it's happened again.
Oh, bugger!
Oh, well.
Fuck it, can't think of everything.
Oh look!
They've got one of them there glass swans.
Where to?
My mum used to have one of those.
Oh, yeah!
This is a beauty.
It's really heavy.
Perfectly sculptured.
Look at this, bud.
You see, it's the weight of the lead that they put in the crystal, see?
Oh, feel the quality of him.
Oh, yeah, I see where you're coming from, Kev.
Might take this home for my Carol.
I promised Phil some new saucepans.
And a toaster.
You get a better quality of toaster up at this estate.
Well, you know what they're like round here, all fur coat and no knickers.
Nouveau reech, in't it?
Mind you, I wouldn't have done it out like this, would you?
I don't like that paint job at all.
Magnolia and lime?
Bollocks!
Time?
All that time when those fucking bills were coming in and you did nothing about it!
How long was that?
Cos when I looked at them
I'd say there was a good six, seven months' worth!
It takes time to sort out - you wouldn't let me deal with it!
I know you're not the sharpest tool in the box...
We're not going to sort it out here.
Get in the car!
I hate KFC.
What?
Elliot Evans's parents got divorced and his dad spent every night in KFC.
Then he met this woman and she had a huge problem, so he tried to help her, and her friend got really angry and he ended up with only one kneecap.
And now his mum's doing pornos and his dad's a junkie and he never sees them.
Except on the internet, and then he has to pay for it!
I mean, how unfair is that?
- I never thought you'd fail as a father!
- I haven't failed as a father!
You've let your kids down!
They're in the car, all that time when those fucking bills were coming in...
How long was that?
Cos when I looked...
I'm so fed up!
I can't go on like this, Rob.
I swear to God, I've had it up to here with you.
Drop me and the kids at the airport.
I'm going to my mum's.
No!
Get back in the car, Katie!
Mum, we can't afford the flights to Malaga.
We're broke!
You want to sleep with your dad on the streets?
It won't come to that!
Well, where else are we going to stay?
!
Fix it, Rob.
Or I'm getting in the car and I am leaving with the children.
There is someone we can stay with.
Who?
Good morning, Naomi.
You're looking sexy.
You heard of a shower?
What do you want?
This is difficult, OK?
But we've lost our house.
Oh, that was careless.
So what?
We need somewhere to stay.
Your house is pretty empty at the moment.
You're having a fucking laugh.
Yes, Naomi, I'm kidding that my parents have no money, no house and are about to split up.
I'm sorry, but...
It's not my problem.
Oh, but it is.
Cos it's Emily's problem.
She's your girlfriend.
That makes it your problem.
No lesbian digs?
That, I can't promise.
I'm gonna sort this.
I'll be back later.
Running away again?
He's gone to look for somewhere to live, actually.
I'm not going in there.
Please, Mum.
You've got nowhere else to go.
Please?
We've run out of cereals.
Garibaldi?
Thank you.
Look at her, swanning about as if she's done nothing wrong.
She hasn't.
I want the best for Emily, and she isn't.
How do you know?
Mums know these things.
You'll realise that one day.
Are you really going to leave Dad?
When your dad and I got married, we had nothing.
We spent years working and saving, so that you kids could have the best of everything.
And for what?
It's all gone.
I never thought we'd split up.
But then I never thought I'd be evicted from my home or that my daughter would be a so rebellious.
People always let you down, princess.
They fuck things up.
Not you, though.
Mum, I need to tell you something.
I know everything's going wrong at the moment but... it's just I went to the doctor's the other day, and...
Fuck's sake.
You could have called.
- You've been out all night.
- I know.
Can you blame me?
And now they're here.
We've got enough problems.
Stop it, Em!
All the shit she put us through, you let her march into our home.
She's your mum.
She's a selfish cow, is what she is.
Emily?
Whatever!
Stay here.
Don't expect me to care, cos I don't.
It's just for a couple of days while we get ourselves out of this pickle.
Stay out of my way.
This is my house.
I live here with my girlfriend.
And we're having a barbecue.
All right?
Whatever you say, love.
I'm going to finish emptying the car.
Wow, isn't this peachy?
Who's got any more pills?
Effy?
Don't you think you've had enough?
Don't think.
Makes life much easier.
Naomi, darling?
Got any more of your special powder?
No?
Don't, Em.
Where's Cook when you need him, eh?
Somebody phone for more pills.
Another fun day at Mrs. and Mrs. Campbell's.
Come on!
What's wrong with everyone?
Turn the music up.
Come on, you boring bastards.
Can I interest you ladies in a "cooked to perfection" burger?
Don't think so.
Hey, babes.
Did you miss me?
- D'you want me to ask everyone to leave?
- Thanks, Thomas.
What's the point?
It's all fucked anyway.
What the fuck are you doing, Emily?
Emily, fucking stop this shit now!
Naomi, darling, am I making you nice and wet?
Fuck you!
This is a fucking pantomime.
Fuck you right back.
Ems, stop it.
Stay out of this.
What?
Want to fuck her, is that it?
Maybe I do.
So what?
That's enough!

Pretending to be happy families, pretending to love each other.
Don't you dare speak to me like that.
Get off your high horse.
I can't...
I can't be here any more.
Bit melodramatic.
Remind you of anyone?
Stop it!
Come on, son.
Em...
I'm coming, I've just got to...
I'll catch up with you.
See ya later!
Merde!
Sorry!
Ah!
Super merde!
JJ!
Emily!
JJ!
I think they've all gone out.
Bollocks.
You gonna stand there till they get back?
Yes, yes, I'll get you a towel and Putain!
Just sit down.
Bit of a pickle!
Do you think I'm a bitch, Thomas?
I think you are Katie.
You should always be you.
You're strong and...
I'm just too aggressive, just like my fucking mum.
I know it.
I am a bitch.

I wasn't honourable.
We can be friends.
Yes, I'd like that.

They're using tongues and everything.

Just calm down, love.
I'm gonna burn your "Gym of the Year" certificate.
- What?
- What's going on, Mum?
Is Dad coming back?
We'll talk about it later.
You need to concentrate on doing a good job for me tonight, OK?
We've got a lot riding on this wedding now, sweetheart.
Let me look at you.
Perfection.
Katie!
This is Candace, my BFFE.
Nice outfit!
Sorry about the change of theme.
Candy surprised us all with these.
Soz, hun.
I was going to get you one but I didn't know what to put on the back.
Another shot, Brands?
WTF, Cands.
Here we go, a toast to my new boyfriend, Danny Guillermo.
To husbands, handbags and holidays!
Danny's told me about you.
I figured you'd have bigger tits.
They're like Danny's favourite thing ever.
- He never complained.
- Not to your face.
So, you got a new man now then?
Brandy, Baby, I am paying Katie to work, not to socialise.
Sorry, Mum.
Our table is finally ready, girls.
My darling daughter has been blessed with her looks and what God didn't give her, my plastic surgeon did!
Brandy, sweetheart, beautiful...
I am so proud of you.
You've grown up to be a sexy, arousing woman.
And what with the wedding, and now the baby, you've just exceeded all my expectations.
What baby?
Mummy, it's a secret.
It's better for people to know, than think you're a fatty.
Girlies, will you please raise your glasses and toast my angel, daughter and grandchild bearer!
To Brandylicious!
Brandylicious!
Now, let's all get completely wrecked, give them paps something to print tomorrow!
Hiya, Babes.
You having a rave?
Rave and a half.
I'm so angry Mummy told everyone I got knocked up.
Yeah, I bet.
Oh, I'll have some of that.
You do know you're not supposed to drink when you're pregnant?
Don't care, and I don't think you can talk to me like that.
I'll do what I want.
You're in my way.
Move.
Katie!
What are you doing here?
You cool?
Have a drink with us.
Is that a joke?
Katie, I'm...
You haven't changed.
I can see straight through you.
Likewise.
Never going to let that smile falter?
Only when yours does.
Sweetheart, I've run out of fags.
You'll need to run along and go and get some more.
One, I'm not your fucking maid.
Two, I don't work for you, so you'll have to go and get your own fags, sweetheart.
Stupid bitch.
Rudeness!
Swallow or spit, girlfriend?
How dare she?
Who does she think she is?
Who the fuck do you think you are?
I'm Katie fucking Fitch.
Who the fuck are you?
Come on, princess, that's enough for one night.
Get off me!
Look at yourself.
You are disgusting.
You are an embarrassment.
Sack her, Mummy.
You and your useless mother are fired.
Get rid of her.
Come on, sweet cheeks, don't mess with them.
I don't smoke.
What you scared of?
Uh, cancer?
Fuck it.
Steady.
You didn't inhale properly.
Breathe in.
Now breathe in again so it goes there.
Why are you being nice to me?
Life's too short.
You are such a fucking cliche.
So what's it like?
What's what like?
Love.
Great.
It's really lovely.
That sounded convincing.
It's fine.
Nothing's ever perfect, you know?
I thought it could be.
I wanted the perfect boyfriend, perfect marriage, perfect everything.
What's changed?
Me.
I don't know who I am any more.
I thought you were Katie fucking Fitch!
I used to hide in the bath when she was angry.
I've really messed up, kiddo.
Yeah, but you love each other, right?
For richer, for poorer.
Kids... it seems that your father has let us down once again.
Jen, please.
He's been selfish and stupid.
- Mum, stop it!
- I suggest you keep shtoom, young lady, considering you've lost us the only income we had.
Because of his stupidity, this house... our home, is being taken from us.
Today.
Tell your children what that means, Rob.
It means we're homeless.
That's right, it means we're homeless because of your dad.
I tried to save the gym.
It's these loan companies, nice as pie one minute, next thing they're calling you up, sending you letters, but you gotta believe me, we're going to make a fortune out of that machine.
That machine's a total waste of space, Rob, just like you.
Take James upstairs.
But Mum...
Katie, for once, do as you're told.
How could you do this to us?
To your own children?
- Your own children?
- I'm trying to do the best I can.
Have you got any sense of responsibility?
- Have you heard of communication?
- I'm doing the best I can.
- Have you got any sense of responsibility?
- You're just like a child!
Hello?
Come on, folks.
Yes?
Good morning, sweetheart.
We're here to repossess your belongings.
Love, open up, would ya?
Come on, folks!
Don't fuck us about!
Open up, open the door.
Get your stuff.
Morning, Mr. Fitch.
Hey, lads, you're going to be reasonable, yeah?
Certainly, ain't we?
Reasonable's our middle name.
Good, ta.
Can you just read out your court order, just so I know you're not, you know...
Cunts.
Righty-oh.
"By the order of the county court, given this day, 17th of February 2010,
"it is hereby given down that goods to the value of £13,337...
"...
William M Janus and granted licence to reposse..."
Are you still there, Mr. Fitch?
Hello?
Something's not right here.
All right, my lover?
You going to open up?
I got sweeties.
Paedo!
- Move!
- Garage!
Go!
Come on, open up, you lot.
Come on, this is getting stupid now.
Right, fuck this, we're going in.
Hello?
Tell you what...
I think it's happened again.
Oh, bugger!
Oh, well.
Fuck it, can't think of everything.
Oh look!
They've got one of them there glass swans.
Where to?
My mum used to have one of those.
Oh, yeah!
This is a beauty.
It's really heavy.
Perfectly sculptured.
Look at this, bud.
You see, it's the weight of the lead that they put in the crystal, see?
Oh, feel the quality of him.
Oh, yeah, I see where you're coming from, Kev.
Might take this home for my Carol.
I promised Phil some new saucepans.
And a toaster.
You get a better quality of toaster up at this estate.
Well, you know what they're like round here, all fur coat and no knickers.
Nouveau reech, in't it?
Mind you, I wouldn't have done it out like this, would you?
I don't like that paint job at all.
Magnolia and lime?
Bollocks!
Time?
All that time when those fucking bills were coming in and you did nothing about it!
How long was that?
Cos when I looked at them
I'd say there was a good six, seven months' worth!
It takes time to sort out - you wouldn't let me deal with it!
I know you're not the sharpest tool in the box...
We're not going to sort it out here.
Get in the car!
I hate KFC.
What?
Elliot Evans's parents got divorced and his dad spent every night in KFC.
Then he met this woman and she had a huge problem, so he tried to help her, and her friend got really angry and he ended up with only one kneecap.
And now his mum's doing pornos and his dad's a junkie and he never sees them.
Except on the internet, and then he has to pay for it!
I mean, how unfair is that?
- I never thought you'd fail as a father!
- I haven't failed as a father!
You've let your kids down!
They're in the car, all that time when those fucking bills were coming in...
How long was that?
Cos when I looked...
I'm so fed up!
I can't go on like this, Rob.
I swear to God, I've had it up to here with you.
Drop me and the kids at the airport.
I'm going to my mum's.
No!
Get back in the car, Katie!
Mum, we can't afford the flights to Malaga.
We're broke!
You want to sleep with your dad on the streets?
It won't come to that!
Well, where else are we going to stay?
!
Fix it, Rob.
Or I'm getting in the car and I am leaving with the children.
There is someone we can stay with.
Who?
Good morning, Naomi.
You're looking sexy.
You heard of a shower?
What do you want?
This is difficult, OK?
But we've lost our house.
Oh, that was careless.
So what?
We need somewhere to stay.
Your house is pretty empty at the moment.
You're having a fucking laugh.
Yes, Naomi, I'm kidding that my parents have no money, no house and are about to split up.
I'm sorry, but...
It's not my problem.
Oh, but it is.
Cos it's Emily's problem.
She's your girlfriend.
That makes it your problem.
No lesbian digs?
That, I can't promise.
I'm gonna sort this.
I'll be back later.
Running away again?
He's gone to look for somewhere to live, actually.
I'm not going in there.
Please, Mum.
You've got nowhere else to go.
Please?
We've run out of cereals.
Garibaldi?
Thank you.
Look at her, swanning about as if she's done nothing wrong.
She hasn't.
I want the best for Emily, and she isn't.
How do you know?
Mums know these things.
You'll realise that one day.
Are you really going to leave Dad?
When your dad and I got married, we had nothing.
We spent years working and saving, so that you kids could have the best of everything.
And for what?
It's all gone.
I never thought we'd split up.
But then I never thought I'd be evicted from my home or that my daughter would be a so rebellious.
People always let you down, princess.
They fuck things up.
Not you, though.
Mum, I need to tell you something.
I know everything's going wrong at the moment but... it's just I went to the doctor's the other day, and...
Fuck's sake.
You could have called.
- You've been out all night.
- I know.
Can you blame me?
And now they're here.
We've got enough problems.
Stop it, Em!
All the shit she put us through, you let her march into our home.
She's your mum.
She's a selfish cow, is what she is.
Emily?
Whatever!
Stay here.
Don't expect me to care, cos I don't.
It's just for a couple of days while we get ourselves out of this pickle.
Stay out of my way.
This is my house.
I live here with my girlfriend.
And we're having a barbecue.
All right?
Whatever you say, love.
I'm going to finish emptying the car.
Wow, isn't this peachy?
Who's got any more pills?
Effy?
Don't you think you've had enough?
Don't think.
Makes life much easier.
Naomi, darling?
Got any more of your special powder?
No?
Don't, Em.
Where's Cook when you need him, eh?
Somebody phone for more pills.
Another fun day at Mrs. and Mrs. Campbell's.
Come on!
What's wrong with everyone?
Turn the music up.
Come on, you boring bastards.
Can I interest you ladies in a "cooked to perfection" burger?
Don't think so.
Hey, babes.
Did you miss me?
- D'you want me to ask everyone to leave?
- Thanks, Thomas.
What's the point?
It's all fucked anyway.
What the fuck are you doing, Emily?
Emily, fucking stop this shit now!
Naomi, darling, am I making you nice and wet?
Fuck you!
This is a fucking pantomime.
Fuck you right back.
Ems, stop it.
Stay out of this.
What?
Want to fuck her, is that it?
Maybe I do.
So what?
That's enough!
What's this all about?
It's none of your business.
I fucked the dead girl.
I fucked Sophia and gave her the drugs and now she's punishing me for it.
I knew you'd screw her up.
Hey!
Good news, everyone.
I found us a caravan.
What have I missed?
Why don't you all just fuck off?
Look at you.
Pretending to be happy families, pretending to love each other.
Don't you dare speak to me like that.
Get off your high horse.
I can't...
I can't be here any more.
Bit melodramatic.
Remind you of anyone?
Stop it!
Come on, son.
Em...
I'm coming, I've just got to...
I'll catch up with you.
See ya later!
Merde!
Sorry!
Ah!
Super merde!
JJ!
Emily!
JJ!
I think they've all gone out.
Bollocks.
You gonna stand there till they get back?
Yes, yes, I'll get you a towel and Putain!
Just sit down.
Bit of a pickle!
Do you think I'm a bitch, Thomas?
I think you are Katie.
You should always be you.
You're strong and...
I'm just too aggressive, just like my fucking mum.
I know it.
I am a bitch.
Everyone relies on you to tell the truth, Katie.
They need you.
That thing you do - is it for real?
What thing?
The lovely honourable thing.
I'm not.
I screw up so often.
Panda, college everything.
Right now I'm Monsieur Screw.
D'you fancy me?
Just checking.
Of course.
I can't have kids.
They say I can't have kids ever.
And you're sad?
You think maybe no man will ever want you?
But I am a man, and I think you're a beautiful, magnificent woman.
Panda was an idiot not to forgive you.
I was the idiot.
I wasn't honourable.
We can be friends.
Yes, I'd like that.
Me too.
Give me five minutes.
Mum?
Mum...
I can't have children.
I went to the doctor's yesterday and they said there's nothing they can do.
I wanted to tell you, but you were too busy shouting.
It's all about you.
I don't want to let you down, but you let me down.
I really needed you and you weren't there.
My baby girl.
It doesn't matter, Mum.
The house and the money.
I don't want it.
I'm not going to be you.
I just want a mum who loves me, no matter what.
I do love you, no matter what.
I'm so sorry.
And we love you, Mum.
So appreciate us.
Stop trying to push us away.
Jen.
I love you.
You stupid bastard!
I'm sorry.
They're using tongues and everything.

Caterham, my dear chap, I wouldn't ask, only it's a matter of considerable national importance.
Isn't it always?
We've had the most tremendous approach from Vienna.
Go on.
Now the Austrians are a nice neutral bunch, they're very keen to be friends with us Brits.
- What's the offer?
- Iron ore.
We go in, help them put their heavy industry back on its feet, take home all the iron ore we need.
The PM can scarcely believe his luck.
Anyway, Vienna's sending over an envoy.
Count Ludwig.
I've been tasked with sitting the Count down, putting pen to paper and getting him to sign the contract.
Somewhere green and pleasant and, above all, discreet.
And you thought of Chimneys?
Well, you know, a weekend house party.
Good food, decent cellar.
Just like the old days, eh?
What do you say?
Do the ayes have it?
Well, actually, I was thinking of going on holiday next month.
Oh, nonsense.
Nobody goes on holiday in September.
Besides, we're practically family you and I.
Once we bring that girl of yours to her senses.
We're not as we were.
The house is in some disrepair.
Perfect.
Faded grandeur.
Adds to the flavour.
It'll need to be low-key.
Indeed so.
Intimate.
Discreet.
One or two guests, sensitively chosen.
Of course, these continentals are such fearful snobs.
I'll send my best chap round to help with the setting up.
Bill Eversleigh.
Yours to serve.
How do you do?
But why Chimneys?
It's years since we gave a party.
Decades.
Not since '32.
Show him the letter.
- The...?
- From Count Ludwig.
Here we are.
Fourth para.
Halfway down.
I have heard that Chimneys is the most prized house... .. in old England, and would count it a singular honour to see that jewelled palace for myself.
It is a memory I am most eager to cherish.
Sorry to drop in unannounced.
If you're gentle with me then I'll be gentle with you.
Agh!
Help!
Never, ever... .. touch mother's bicycle again.
Are you all right?
Can you stand?
- Oh, yes, I...
- Well, that's the main thing.
Once you're up on your pins, then life seems so...
Full of possibility.
Indeed.
Not that I was purely concerned about poor mother's bicycle, you understand.
Well, I should hope not.
I think the chap got the message, don't you?
And there he was, galloping in to save me on his iron horse.
I mean it really was the most idiotically chivalrous...
What?
Virginia.
You are as absurdly romantic as your dear mother.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
Woof woof.
Wrong tree.
If you honestly...
He couldn't be more unsuitable.
No cash, no prospects.
Oh, well, then.
Yes, quite.
Case closed.
And, anyway, he's been quite standoffish with me this past week.
I expect he's bored of me.
Don't you?
Oh, yes.
Does he have a name?
Sir Anthony Cade.
Only without the knighthood.
Oh, dear.
I was just thinking.
Your poor MP.
George Lomax won't be the least bit put off.
On the contrary.
Not another ultimatum?
I have until Sunday night to consent to be Mrs George Lomax.
Or what?
He invades Poland, I suppose.
Anyway, the terms are most generous.
He'll put daddy up in a mansion flat in town, which is all he wants since Mama passed away.
And he'll even pay to stop Chimneys from falling apart, which I suppose is jolly good for the family.
If you marry him.
I should be more grateful, obviously.
Well, I'm not sure gratitude is the basis for a happy marriage.
Well, no, no.
Not that I am any sort of expert.
No, Mummy always said you were the most eminently sensible of all her cousins.
Well, she certainly made a splendid marriage.
It should be so simple, shouldn't it, being happy?
I mean, one ought to see it, and just know.
Well, now that I've got you here we are going to have a riot, you and I.
- Are you game?
- Well, I'll do my best.
Well!
Are you quite sure it's all right with your father, having me along?
Oh, Daddy's thrilled.
And, anyway, you've had me down to St Mary Mead.
It's only fair I return the favour.
Here, look.
Page 17.
Isn't he a dish?
Anthony Cade.
Some passing whim.
Virginia is innocent, easily led.
It's all part of her charm.
- Yes, Treadwell?
- Your guest has arrived, sir.
Already?
Shoulders back.
Cometh the hour.
Watch and learn.
Letters for posting on his Lordship's table.
Send them express, if you'd be so kind.
Count Ludwig!
Oh, look.
He's practically licking his shoes.
The Count might think it's some sort of quaint British custom.
A little early but so much the better.
Indeed, a lovely house, yes.
He seems like he's from another age.
I wonder if he speaks any English.
How much English do you need to sign a cheque?
Me metal.
You big, big dollars.
Hello, Daddy!
So sorry, darling.
Ah, dear Jane.
Clement.
It's been...
Well...
Yes, not since the funeral.
You've been so kind to my daughter since we lost Madeleine.
How's your garden?
Hardly thriving, I'm afraid.
Daddy, you might have made a bit of an effort.
Oh, pay no attention to me.
I'm just the odd-job man these days.
Oh, look.
I see you've invited that nice lady from National Heritage.
Hilda Blenkinsopp?
No.
No.
Oh, no!
Now, Bundle, don't get cross.
She was very keen to be invited...
She's banned.
We agreed.
Yes, but the National Heritage have made a very sensible offer.
Chimneys has been in the family for centuries.
It is family.
Yes, but, darling, you know we can't afford to keep the place on.
We will manage.
We always do.
Well, she's on good form.
National Heritage has taken on 13 homes and gardens in the county.
High society, Eversleigh.
What did I say?
Embellish the scene, sir.
Embellish the scene.
Scientists.
Captains of industry...
What do you bring me?
Mrs Mop and Mrs Bucket.
Caterham says they're both first class if you get a bit of gin down them.
- Oh, does he?
- Problem?
Not at all.
Very diverse guest list.
Good.
Well, I should join in.
Was this your doing?
George will have to take us as he finds us.
- What?
- Marry me.
Bill.
Never propose on an empty stomach.
Ask me again after supper.
Don't you have to be somewhere?
Sultry, isn't it?
What have you done to your hair?
Not a thing.
Sweet of you to notice, darling.
You haven't forgotten that you promised me an answer by Sunday night?
The clock is ticking.
Forgive me, but you all looked so perfect.
Like you had stepped out of a photograph.
Count Ludwig, allow me to introduce Clement Revel,
Ninth Marquis of Caterham.
- How do you do?
- The honour is entirely mine.
Gnadige, Damen.
And these are your two little Revels?
Would you indulge a fading guest?
Why not?
I've two left feet.
So why don't you try her?
Because everyone else seems to.
Oh, for a sense of rhythm.
Such a graceful dancer.
Well, they all are, aren't they?
Still, hardly the most practical accomplishment.
Is this your first visit to our shores?
No, I am an inveterate itinerant, I'm afraid.
Or I was, once upon a time.
Now you are laughing at me.
No, no, no, it's just your English.
Splendid.
I had a highly disciplined teacher, you see.
She taught me only tongue-twisters.
Inveterate itinerant.
Inveterate itinerant!
Enough, I think...
Your dinner is getting cold.
Very good.
- Bundle, will you lead on?
- Yes, of course.
Miss Blenkinsopp, after you.
Follow me, ladies.
Very good, you're with us.
- Shall we?
- Oh.
A splendid dinner, thank you.
Yes, very filling.
Forgive my asking, sir.
Your interest in my house, is it for architecture?
No, no.
I have no head for grand design, for architecture.
- Your paintings...
- We sold most of the decent ones.
We still have our Van Dyck.
So I see.
- Who is this fellow?
- Some old duke.
Richmond.
Duke of.
Richmond.
Yes.
So if it's not the art, or the architecture, then...?
Oh, the history.
The great men rumoured to have met within these walls.
Treaties, affairs of state, wars, even, begun and ended here over coffee and cigars.
Oh, nothing so biblical, I assure you.
He's being modest, aren't you, Caterham?
Chimneys had quite a reputation.
So what happened?
- What was that?
- We ran into some bother.
Oh, the party of 1932?
Oh, that old yarn.
Well, we'd come back from an embassy posting.
Caracas.
It was my last one, as it turned out.
It was before Virginia was born.
Anyway, it was quite a night.
Your mother always gave wonderful parties, with a band out in the garden.
I remember the story, yes.
You were there yourself, weren't you, George?
Helping out.
I was accompanying Lady Somerset.
It was um... most instructive.
Is this it here?
- Yes.
- Where is that?
- The rose garden.
- Ah.
Our lovely Viennese waltz.
d La da-da, da-da dum
- Charming singing voice.
- Thank you.
Anyway, there was a bit of a to-do because the Duchess of Somerset had borrowed a large brooch for the evening.
- On her...
- Large brooch?
Daddy, it was the Mysore Diamond from India, possibly the most revered diamond in the world.
Well, whatever it was, by breakfast time it had disappeared.
Stolen.
By some good-for-nothing parlour maid named Agnes.
A parlour maid.
What an English saga!
The maid vanished overnight.
Isn't that right?
And the diamond was never ever to be found again.
- Anyone for more coffee?
- Oh, yes, please.
So what sort of girl was she, this Agnes?
Or did nobody notice?
Well, only 19 years old.
She must have lost her head, I suppose.
Anyway, it meant the end of my career in the diplomatic service.
All rather shameful.
Well, if the ladies can spare us...?
- To business.
- Indeed.
Yes.
I give you business.
You want our iron, Mr Lomax, MP?
Well, naturally.
I make one request.
Chimneys.
Give me Chimneys as a personal favour.
And, in return, I guarantee you can take home all the riches your heart desires.
- Well, I'm not sure...
- We are not for sale.
Not for sale.
Tell them.
Why don't you all try a hand of bridge?
- Oh, for God's sake.
- Yes.
It seems to be in order.
You're quite sure?
Absolutely.
Very well.
Then mark your cross... .. here.
Now, Count, if you'd be kind enough to sign here.
With great pleasure.
Mr Lomax!
Sir!
Jane!
What's happening?
I don't know.
What time is it?
If you'd all like to gather downstairs...
I'm sorry to have to wake you all up but one of Mr Lomax's security staff was found unconscious.
- Is that so?
That's right, sir.
Roberts.
- All present and correct, Eversleigh?
- Indeed so.
I believe we're one short.
- The Count.
- Out for the count.
That's no surprise, considering how he was knocking it back.
See if you can raise him.
- He's not in his room, sir.
- What?
Where is he?
Perhaps we need a search party.
Indeed.
Jaffers you and Roberts seal off the back door.
Bundle, the old servants' quarters.
You and Miss Blenkinsopp, the ground floor, and Virginia and I will look upstairs.
- Can't Virginia come with me?
- We don't have time for this.
Why do you always undermine me?
Will you two kindly desist?
Thank you.
Now, Virginia, can you run upstairs and collect his medicine?
Jane will remain here and keep an eye on him.
- Of course.
The rest of us can just as well look by ourselves.
Agreed?
I've brought your medicine.
Thank God for my darling girls.
Daddy?
George?
Not now!
- That sounded almost like...
- Was that a gunshot?
Someone close that door!
Well, where is he?
Any sign?
- Did you hear it?
- I think half the county heard it.
He can't have just vanished.
Are there no doorways, no outbuildings?
- You don't think...?
- Our little door.
Take that.
Should be torches on the wall.
Help yourself.
Come on, Jane.
- What is that?
Blood?
- Looks like it.
Anthony?
- I think he's been shot.
- What?
Want.
Want!
Count Ludwig?
Can you hear me?
- Is he breathing?
- Check his pulse.
Can you hear me?
- It wasn't me.
- I can't find a pulse.
- I think he's dead.
- It wasn't me!
Virginia!
Virginia!
Virginia!
Virginia!
He was such an enchanting man.
And he was our guest.
I'm sure there's a perfectly innocent explanation.
Virginia!
- I should go to him.
- Don't you dare.
Gin, come back.
- Virginia!
- Anthony.
- My love.
- Anthony!
- You can't go in, miss.
- May I at least speak to him?
- I'm sorry, miss.
- Oh, please.
Please.
Anthony, what are you even doing here?
Virginia...
You must promise me something.
Anything.
Please... promise me you'll forget me.
Anthony?
You're scaring me.
Anthony.
Finch.
Thank God.
Good to see you again.
Inspector Finch.
The guru of Scotland Yard.
Finch?
He looks quite like a cat, don't you think?
I loathe cats.
Ssh!
I gather he has devotees all over the Home Office.
They regard him as some sort of mystic.
A bit like Julian of Norwich, only with powers of arrest.
What do we know of the victim?
Born Vienna, 1892.
Wealthy parents.
Travelled about a good deal in his youth.
Something of a wandering spirit.
Entered politics soon after the war.
I can get my chap to find you a place in the town.
I shall be staying at Chimneys.
Murder rarely keeps office hours.
Hello.
Bit of fresh air.
Politically this could be a disaster, if not handled with care.
Indeed.
So the ladies retired early?
We had some business.
- Er... not relevant.
- He wanted to buy Chimneys.
He wanted to buy Chimneys?
Well, the proposal was that the government would purchase the house, and then pass it on to Count Ludwig as a gift.
- A bribe?
- Don't be absurd...
A personal bribe.
In return for which, he hands over a share of their heavy industry.
Where do we stand on that, morally?
Well back, I'd have thought.
Is there paperwork for this sale?
Signed, sealed and in my room in the top drawer.
All academic now, of course.
Understood.
As one door closes, another stands ajar, Lord Caterham.
Indeed.
So you gentlemen retired at...
About a quarter to eleven.
Until we were woken by the fire bell.
Mr Lomax!
Sir!
- At what time?
- Twenty to midnight.
We all met downstairs.
No sign of the Count.
So off we went, looking for him.
All save Clement and myself.
Next thing...
Boom!
The gunshot?
He was in the passageway all along.
Just a few yards away.
Any fingerprints on the weapon?
Regrettably not.
Still, we have the culprit.
Anthony Cade.
He has one or two questions to answer, certainly.
May I see the body?
I shall take you there at once.
Or perhaps Miss...
Marple.
Marple.
Yes.
If it's no inconvenience?
Oh.
Well, no, not at all.
What was he doing here, almost an hour after he went to bed?
He showed an interest over dinner in the Van Dyck portrait.
I suppose the Count could have returned...
- A private viewing?
- I suppose.
And chanced upon the secret door.
Except that nothing quite happens by chance, does it?
Not really.
Or is that my tidy-minded preference?
I see you don't have a man with you.
I'm sorry?
Well, inspectors nowadays tend to have a man with them.
Perhaps you prefer to muse alone?
Perhaps no man would have me.
Oh.
This blood...
He was shot here.
And crawled, staggered, or was dragged this-a-way... .. where he was found in the arms of Mr Cade.
Here.
Before falling on poor Virginia.
Here.
All fairly straightforward, apparently.
Ah-ha.
Is it a letter?
Not quite.
A treble clef.
A virtuoso.
Perhaps you could take this and study it for me, Miss Marple.
Very well.
The Count said something before he died.
Want, want...
Want?
Are you sure?
Mm-hm.
Meaning?
Well, I suppose we all want something, even at death's door.
Kiss of life, perhaps?
How did you get here?
I climbed over the wall.
I was eager to get up to the house and this gentleman was blocking the path.
Would you mind, sir?
As I remember,
I came from around here.
Then I spotted the gentleman, I panicked, and then...
You hit him.
Yes, I am sorry about that.
Using this?
Exactly.
- What time was that?
- 11:33.
Precisely.
I remember because I looked at my watch.
I envy your eyesight, Mr Cade.
You see, that's the thing.
I know, because there was a light on in one of the upstairs rooms.
It was first storey and then second to the right.
Now, I can remember because someone had lit a fire.
Rather a warm night for a fire.
Well, there was definitely smoke coming out of the chimney above.
Anyway, at this stage common sense sounded the retreat.
Did you heed the warning?
Sadly, common sense and I are no longer on speaking terms so I carried on along here and through the door.
And then I came down here, opened the trap door
and then I heard the gunshot.
Good God!
- He'd been shot already?
- Yes.
- Any idea who shot him?
- Afraid not.
And yet, the revolver three feet from you, the victim at your heels?
I swear I never saw any revolver.
Mr Cade, may one ask what you were actually doing here?
Yes, well, I did wonder when you'd get around to asking that.
The truth is, I couldn't let Lomax have his way without putting up a fight.
- His way with Virginia?
- Yes.
I thought to myself: just sit tight and then burst in at breakfast and give you all a fright.
You certainly did that.
The constable found this in your pocket.
Oh.
Any idea who wrote it?
"Dear Cade, come to Chimneys.
There's a trapdoor in the garden.
11:45 sharp. "
What?
I didn't write this.
Are you sure?
Mr Cade seems to think...
Not my style.
A love note is not something you just dash off.
I don't see what you're sniggering at.
I'm sorry - idiot - may I see?
Hand it over.
It appears from the postmark to have been sent locally, express service, as late as yesterday morning.
So, none of you sent this letter?
How's this for a hypothesis?
Cade types the letter himself, takes the train down to the village and posts it.
All in a cynical bid to ensnare Virginia.
Rubbish!
I was having tea with him yesterday morning.
At the Lyons Corner House on the Edgware Road.
And it was very nice.
Mr Lomax, your room is second from the end, isn't it?
So?
There was a light on there last night.
Just before the alarm sounded.
Rubbish!
Says who?
Oh.
Cade.
Blatant attempt to put you off your game, Inspector.
Anthony.
I told you.
I'm not worth the sacrifice.
I'll be the judge of that, thank you very much.
If you would be so good as to remain at Chimneys until further notice.
What about him?
You're not going to let him wander about?
We'll keep an eye on him.
Keep an eye on all of you.
I always say the point of a tune is to boost the morale, surely?
Indeed.
- May I help?
- Ah, Treadwell, the very man.
Where is that musical handbook of Virginia's?
You know the one?
Hits Of The Blitz?
The very nelly.
Come.
No...
Oh.
Hard at it, Miss Marple?
Inspector, it's...
I'm a little lost.
One can hardly see where one bar ends and the next begins.
I'm sorry, forgive me.
It's...
Hardly music at all.
Could it be...
I almost wonder...
Forgive me.
Go on.
Well, I wonder, is it possible, it is, in fact, a message of some sort in code?
What were you thinking of?
You know nothing about the man or his people.
I know he's funny and reckless and his mother has a jolly nice bicycle, which I happen to think counts for more than a dozen columns in Who's Who.
- He ran a bar.
- Oh, how philanthropic.
In Africa.
In Bulawayo.
He had a friend with him, they were business partners.
And does this friend have a name?
Jimmy McGrath.
They did rather well, for a time, but Jimmy liked to drink, you see.
He gambled it all away.
Lost it in one sitting to a gentleman from Pretoria.
You've known him for less than a fortnight.
- Daddy.
- Ah, Caterham.
Knock some sense into your daughter.
Oh, well it's a brave man who'd dare to.
What would your mother have said?
My mother, you presume to speak about, always went with her heart.
Isn't that so?
And she raised me to do the same.
- Virginia!
- Anthony is no murderer.
What's she doing?
Trying to prove her lover innocent.
How does she propose to do that?
I have no idea.
Like it or not, Mr Cade was still there, in the tunnel, with the smoking gun.
- Will you arrest him?
- I'm tempted.
He's careless, all the lies he tells.
The letter, that business with the light on in the house...
A man like Cade requires plenty of rope.
Like most of us.
Even you.
Am I under suspicion?
I know your secret, Miss Marple.
You are a puzzle-outer of mysteries.
I muddle through one or two.
It's a matter of association.
I envy you, you know, the amateur sleuth.
One has nothing to lose, somehow.
Still, a salary is er... convenient.
Indeed.
If it wasn't for the generosity of my nephew...
Raymond.
So I've read in a dozen case files.
Yes.
Hardly a distinguished name.
- Raymond?
- No.
Chimneys.
Until it stands before one, and then it all makes sense.
Dozens of them.
Splendid.
That great tower standing proud, so that...
Which was the window Mr Cade said was lit up on the night of the murder?
Second from the right?
The MP's room.
And yet, as one approaches the spot where Mr Cade stood, a window is obscured.
Do you see?
On account of the tower.
So that what appears to be second from the right is, in fact...
Third from the right.
So who was up and about moments before the gunshot?
At 33 minutes past 11 your bedroom light was on, 12 minutes before the gunshot.
Yes.
Briefly.
Can you tell me why?
I wished to speak to Count Ludwig, but noticing his bed was unoccupied, I returned to my room.
Any particular reason for wishing to speak to him?
Oh, he'd... earlier in the evening he'd asked for an extra blanket.
So perhaps you lit a fire?
I beg your pardon?
At the same time. 11:33.
No fires last night.
I...
I would have known, you see.
You know, it's funny, but yesterday I really felt that you knew him.
This looks a very grand affair.
That's how they did it in those days.
And this would be the orchestra, at the back here?
What sort of music did they play?
Waltzes, mainly.
Viennese waltzes?
It's him, isn't it?
There.
Count Ludwig.
So he has been here before.
And where else but in the orchestra?
What brought you back after all these years?
Any thoughts, Miss Treadwell?
He got no more than he deserved.
I'm sorry?
The girl who...
Who disappeared?
Agnes.
The parlour maid, yes.
Whatever happened to Agnes?
That night after the party, I...
I saw a light...
This was the tomb I saw opened.
Her body, it was down there.
Let me help you.
Clement, are you sure?
Agnes.
Her apron.
Poor child.
All this time, we said she was the thief.
I think it's time you told us what happened.
The mistress, she confided in me once.
Madeleine?
What did she tell you?
She said Agnes was with him that night.
With whom?
A musician.
A fiddle player.
Oh, the Count?
All these years.
Not a word.
I wanted to, sir.
But I thought if I spoke out, you would contact the police, and there would be more of a scandal.
It had already ruined your career and if a stolen jewel could cast such a shadow, and then the theft of a life...
I'm so sorry.
Oh, what have I done?
I'm so sorry.
- Well?
- She's certainly hiding something.
Damn.
Oh.
- Wondered if there was any...
- What?
Cardboard.
Wondered if there was any...
What are you...?
- What do you want cardboard for?
- I'm making something.
Well, I can't see any, so if you wouldn't mind.
What are you up to, Miss Blenkinsopp?
Just looking for some privacy in this big, old nasty... house.
Hands off.
Sorry.
I'll leave you to it.
Oh, it's child's play.
It's musical mathematics.
Don't you see?
One simply transposes the music from notes into letters.
So two octaves... take us from A up to O, while these 11 sharps bring us all the way up to Z.
Your coded letter.
# La!
La-la!
Please, I cannot abide flattery.
Thank you, Lady Revel.
Thank you.
- Very well.
- Thank you, Bundle.
"For this reason, my beloved Captain...
I can never see you again.
Promise me you will return one day for the greatest jewel.
Richmond Twenty, North Three East. "
A love letter in the dead man's pocket.
Incomplete.
If we had a couple more pages...
A date'd be helpful.
Though the manuscript was written in ballpoint pen.
Indeed.
So, the last couple of years.
Yes.
A farewell?
"Beloved Captain. " Captain?
An alias for Count Ludwig, if this affair was to be kept quiet?
The Count had a secret lover.
Agnes?
Perhaps.
But what do we make of this?
"Promise me you will return one day for the greatest jewel. "
Is it possible...?
Count Ludwig came here to Chimneys not to discuss iron, but on a secret mission, revealed within this letter, to recover the stolen Mysore Diamond located somewhere in this house.
No wonder it's in code.
That's why he wanted to buy Chimneys.
"Richmond Twenty, North Three East. "
The evidence was before our eyes.
The Van Dyck?
And the subject?
The Duke of Richmond.
18, 19, 20.
So?
So.
Don't torment me, Inspector.
If you're holding something back...
Want, want...
His last words.
Unless, of course...
Vunt, vunt...
Unless of course he was speaking not English, but his mother tongue.
Not "want, want" but "vunt, vunt".
"Der Wand" in High German.
Or "vunt" in the Austrian dialect.
Meaning?
The wall, the wall.
You think...?
You think the diamond is hidden somewhere in the wall?
Well.
Bravo.
But, you know, I think I know a gentleman who might shed a little more light on the matter.
You were accompanying your godmother?
Lady...
Lady Somerset.
That's right.
We all used to call her Robbie.
Must have been quite bewitching.
What?
The diamond.
Oh.
I see.
Well, it's all just coloured glass to me, Inspector.
What have you got there?
Notes from the investigation in '32.
Interviews with, among others, yourself.
"I have no recollection of said diamond's disappearance.
In fact, I was asleep. "
I'd been charging about since dawn.
Really, Inspector...
I see Lady Somerset retired early as well.
We had nothing to do with any theft, I assure you.
The point is...
See for yourself.
I was a young rake.
She was easily led.
I see.
Well, at least, I have an inkling.
And he was writing under a nom de plume.
Count Ludwig had an alias?
Mm-hm.
The Captain.
Odd.
And a secret lover, to boot.
It's all in the letter.
Who was she, the lover?
We wondered.
Agnes?
Poor Agnes.
Not only that.
The Count seems to have had a hand in the theft of the famous diamond.
So he bumped her off, did he?
Two thieves fighting over the spoils?
Well, do start away, everyone.
Yes, and she wasn't the only one, was she?
The only victim, I mean.
Bill, where is the...?
Right here, my dearest.
Chimneys.
It's not quite to scale, I'm afraid.
The night of the murder.
We all came downstairs.
Yes?
And we couldn't find the Count, so off we all went.
Separately.
Now, this is the point.
This is where we all were.
So, Bundle, you were upstairs in the guest wing.
George was there also.
Treadwell, kitchen.
Miss Blenkinsopp, I believe, was on the terrace.
Bill - study and I was upstairs then down to the council chamber.
Then...
Gunshot!
Back we all flew, front door wide open.
Someone close that door!
Agreed?
Who's to say one of us couldn't have run out of the house through the garden, trapdoor, into the passage, shot the Count and then one minute to get back, after the gunshot, in time to make it look like... well, to make it look like we'd been in the house all along?
Front door to the trapdoor is...
How many strides, Bill?
We measured it. 112?
112.
Five minutes there and back.
It's possible.
You said so yourself, didn't you, Bill?
Sure.
But why would anybody...?
The Count wanted Chimneys, didn't he?
And, Bundle, you're so mortally opposed to losing the house.
I had no idea I was so pathetically grasping.
Well, somebody killed him.
And as for that poor dead girl...
My little fox.
What you need is fattening up.
Enough.
Quite.
You making notes, Blenkinsopp?
No.
To think, what a pleasing oral history this will all make back in your municipal headquarters.
Not at all.
When everyone knows you've had your claws in Chimneys for years, grubbing about with your letters and your polite notices, rifling through our drawers, tipping off our creditors.
Mother was on her death bed, not that you lost a moment's sleep over that.
- God knows why.
- I'll tell you why.
I caught her in the study, going through the old housekeeping records, weren't you?
1932.
This is all about Agnes, isn't it?
You knew her?
Agnes Parker was a child, a child when she was handed over to people like you.
Trusted to your care.
And when one morning she wasn't there, it broke her family's heart.
And not one of you had the decency to ask why.
I feel sick.
Well, you might.
No, I feel sick.
- Daddy?
- Clement?
It's his ticker.
Where's your tonic?
Your tonic!
Excuse me.
There's hardly any left.
Just take a swig.
- Excuse me.
- Damn soup.
Let's get some fresh air.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so terribly sorry.
What kind of soup is this, Miss Treadwell?
Mushroom and sage.
But you are quite well.
Oh, I have no appetite by nightfall.
One of the hidden costs of old age.
Miss Treadwell, help me here.
Are you quite sure in your mind that the Count murdered poor Agnes?
If there's anything else, then, please...?
It's been so many years.
- Can this not wait until the morning?
- No.
Fuse wire.
What's that doing there?
Indeed.
Dear me, what a business.
Ah, yes.
Foxglove leaves.
Easily muddled with sage.
Must have found their way into the soup.
- Foxglove, you see, contains...
- Digitalis.
Natural poison.
I'll be indoors.
Sorry.
Jane.
Here to rebuke me?
Castigate away.
No.
Your sister's account of last night.
Please don't mind Ginny.
Her nerves are shot.
I noticed that you were upstairs, here in the guest wing, during the search party, and I wondered what became of them.
Of...?
The legal paperwork, drawn up last night for the sale of Chimneys, which you took from Mr Lomax's room.
Oh, that.
Old maid's last refuge, isn't it?
An overweening love of domestic animals.
Not that they ever reciprocated.
It was always Treadwell.
Every dog and pup we ever had.
She used to give them the funniest names.
There's really no need to stay, sir.
No, I'm fine.
She had a weak heart?
Well, not that I knew.
I wondered merely why the poison in the foxglove leaves should prove lethal for her while the rest of us...
Well... she was a terrible worrier.
Shanghai. '27.
She travelled about with us everywhere.
And this one?
Oh...
Do you know, I have no idea.
Our friend the Captain.
All of them?
Looks like it.
And not in musical code.
Not this one.
Who was he writing to?
Constance?
She was with us for so many years.
One forgot she even had a Christian name.
Constance Treadwell.
I was so sure she was holding something from us.
Constance was Count Ludwig's lover?
My dearest Constance.
Nine days until the party at the Palazzo Ducale.
It feels like a prison sentence...
It has rained every day since Caracas.
The Captain.
I am mad, Bedlamised, with love.
But the lamb is stamping her little hooves.
I must sign off now.
Be of courage.
Until Friday and Chimneys.
All my love.
...Our glorious reunion.
I will take you in my arms.
And we will make such light-fingered music. "
Treadwell?
I suppose she had much to lose.
Her position, her livelihood.
And when love is driven underground, it quickens its ardour.
Oh, we had a case with our organist and a young page turner at St Mary Mead.
I see.
Well, one mustn't talk scandal.
Places and times.
Venice, Caracas.
He must have trailed her for two years at least.
All the way to Chimneys.
Back to the party.
But Treadwell, a diamond thief?
Well, perhaps it was the Captain who urged her to do it?
What is the "lamb" in these letters?
- That's...
- Well, I think...
I'm so sorry.
You first.
Agnes.
Old papist word for lamb.
Agnes Dei.
Lamb of God.
Altar boy.
Misspent youth.
So, safe to conclude Agnes Parker was the courier, ferrying letters between Constance Treadwell and her "Captain".
And then, on the night of the party in '32, the theft of the Mysore Diamond...
Agnes is murdered.
Wildly circumstantial, but the messenger, murdered by Count Ludwig because she found out about the theft?
She knew too much, the Count buries her in the crypt, and, of course, everyone assumes that Agnes has stolen the diamond.
And then, years later, the two lovers dead themselves.
Or murdered.
That wretched soup.
Which begs the question...
How can the same dish kill one of us while provoking mere unpleasantness in the rest?
The foxgloves tossed into the soup by the killer to convince us that Miss Treadwell's death was an accident.
But, in fact, she was poisoned by something else.
But what?
- I have no idea.
- Pity.
And who among us, I wonder, has been quickest to defend poor Agnes Parker?
Yes.
I was at school with her.
They lived on our street.
This whole business with Agnes, well...
It's how they treat them, isn't it?
You never believed Agnes stole the Mysore Diamond in '32, did you?
Of course not.
But I didn't knock anyone off.
And I certainly don't know anything about any poison.
Digi... digi...
And yet here you are... on the terrace.
Count Ludwig!
Quite alone.
No witnesses.
What do we think?
Could it be that Miss Blenkinsopp climbed into the passage, fired the gunshot... .. then back in the house?
I don't think so.
Not with my asthma.
And yet, you saw something, didn't you?
Yes.
I realise now it must have been Cade I saw in the garden.
It did seem odd behaviour for a security guard.
I could have said something, cried for help.
I could have stopped it, but I just stood there.
You're absolutely right, Inspector.
I fear Mr Cade is running out of rope.
Mr Eversleigh.
Here we are.
"Dear Cade.
Come to Chimneys.
There's a trapdoor in the garden.
11:45 sharp. "
Patent falsehood.
Yes, well.
Note the capital C?
The letter has a little crack in it.
Do you see?
And again here, the same little crack.
So?
The note to Mr Cade appears to have been written on this very typewriter.
Which you yourself were using on the very morning the letter was dispatched.
Oh, I see.
You wrote this, didn't you?
Yes.
Well, some of it, anyway.
But I don't remember anything about 11:45.
But your purpose in writing the letter?
To help Mr Cade gain access to Chimneys?
How long have you been acquainted with Mr Cade?
Couple of weeks.
I lost rather heavily at cards.
My pet vice, losing heavily at cards.
I get so crashingly bored in the office.
There's a little room run in Aldwych, pontoon, poker for the die-hards.
How much did you lose?
97 quid.
Anyway, in walked Cade.
Said he could cover the debt.
He said we could help each other out.
Go on.
So, this gentleman from Pretoria who's holding your friend?
He has a pet passion.
Diamonds?
Yes.
The Mysore Diamond?
He gave me six weeks to bring him the real McCoy or Jimmy's life would be forfeit.
So you staged the street assault to endear yourself to Virginia?
Yes.
Posing as the good Samaritan to creep into the affections of an innocent young woman.
George, please, my head is splitting.
And the assailant?
Agh!
Sorry.
But your real purpose was to gain access to Chimneys, where the diamond was first hidden.
I am a decent man.
Pah.
A decent man who did a stupid thing.
I had no choice.
Ditto.
Absolutely.
Anthony Cade, I am arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Count Ludwig Von Stainach.
Get out!
I love you.
And you.
Really?
Nobody say anything, please.
Just for a moment.
I think, despite everything, that this must be my favourite room in the world.
It was out of bounds as a boy, so naturally it was where one longed to be.
And this heraldic brute.
Oh, the battles we fought, through shot and shell.
Armies, dragons, the whole works.
Then one summer, 12 years old, just tall enough to open his visor, my brother in arms was nothing at all.
Just empty air.
If this is you gently breaking the news that Anthony Cade is no knight in shining armour, consider me rudely awoken.
No, no.
I'm saying that love is its own adventure.
Take no-one for granted, not even those closest to home.
- Jane, help me.
- No, no.
I know what you're saying.
Wish me luck.
Excuse me, George.
Sorry to barge in on matters of state.
I accept.
- I beg your pardon?
- The offer.
If it's still open.
I know how sticky you are about ultimata.
But...
Cade?
Oh.
That was a dream I had.
I'm awake now.
Well, I'm delighted to hear it.
Well, well.
The first of many.
A drink.
Champagne.
A toast!
What are you doing?
Get off him!
You stay there.
Virginia!
Virginia!
A toast.
To us.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
What on earth was that?
It came from inside the house.
In the passageway.
Sir, Cade's escaped.
Try the trapdoor.
It's stuck.
Virginia!
Virginia!
Mr Cade, all this isn't going to look very bright in court.
Virginia!
I want you to know.
I want to give you something - the diamond.
Not that I give a damn.
You're the only prize worth dying for.
And it's got to be here somewhere.
And when I find it, it's yours.
Do you hear?
Anthony!
Got it!
It's him.
Get off me.
He couldn't even get that right.
What's he trying to prove?
Well, he has proven one thing.
- Oh?
- His innocence.
May I show you?
We were all standing just where we were the moment of the fatal gunshot.
Agreed?
- Indeed.
- Everything just as it was?
No.
The gunshot, it was too quiet.
Yes, it was much quieter, Inspector.
Like Mr Cade's hammering a few moments ago, whereas the sound we thought was the gunshot made my ears ring.
Mr Cade, you remember, out in the garden, what did he see on that warm night?
Someone had lit a fire.
And then that off-cut of flex that had no business being in the compost.
A piece of fuse, Inspector.
The Count's killer lit something in the chimney that evening.
On a slow fuse, timed to explode 15 minutes later, to deceive us all that what we heard was a gunshot when what we, in fact, heard was a firework.
What was it you said, Inspector?
"Like it or not, Anthony Cade was found in that tunnel with the smoking gun. "
But what if the gun was not smoking?
What if the Count was killed earlier than supposed, after the men retired from their business at quarter to eleven but before the alarm bell almost an hour later?
Suddenly, the killer could be any one of us.
Are you sure?
You recall the Count's interest, over dinner, in The Duke Of Richmond?
No great feat to quietly invite the Count back after the rest of us were in bed, show him the hidden bolt, tempt him inside, then shoot him, and toss the gun to be found later as if abandoned by the killer.
Sadly for the Count, he didn't die straightaway.
The murderer's only mistake, if mistake it was.
Good God!
The poor man was still living when Mr Cade found him some time later.
Go on, Jane.
Those letters...
I've been woefully, unforgivably naive.
Constance and the Captain - ah, the romance of it.
One gets swept along and yet...
Let me pose a question.
A pair of lovers, determined to hide their secret, might they not write under an alias?
Indeed, Count Ludwig called himself the Captain.
So he did.
But why just the Count and not Constance?
Did she not fear exposure as much as him?
Unless Constance was also an alias.
So the Constance of the letters was not Treadwell?
Forgive me, Bundle.
I took this from your scrapbook.
It's a dog.
So what?
Well, it's Mama's first mutt.
Captain.
It was called Captain.
It was so besotted with Treadwell Mama used to joke they were like...
"Perfect lovers. "
Our mother must have thought of these aliases.
Constance and her Captain.
Our mother...
Took the alias "Constance".
Your mother was the Count's secret lover.
I don't understand.
Are you saying that the Count and Madeleine stole the diamond?
Oh, that wretched diamond.
We're all so bewitched by the Mysore Diamond, we forge our theories and forget the facts.
It is so important to see things clearly, as if through a pane of glass, and not a prism.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Good God.
May I?
I'm afraid there's no way the Count murdered Agnes and made off with the diamond.
Because the diamond has been with Agnes all the time.
In the tomb, just where the killer left it.
When we found poor Agnes's bones, do you remember?
Your histrionics in the crypt.
You took it then, didn't you?
Then dropped it in the fountain.
Why else would you be drying your hands?
Daddy?
Why?
The night of the party.
'32.
I'd lost a cufflink, if you can believe it.
I went upstairs and then...
No, no, you mustn't go in there, please.
Please, sir, listen to what I'm saying.
I'd not meant to kill her, but she tried to prevent me from seeing my wife and the fiddle player.
And then my mind cleared.
I took the diamond.
Left it with Agnes.
Naturally it was assumed that she had run off with it.
Then all that remained was to tell my wife a white lie.
You told her Agnes had been seen.
Cavorting with the Viennese fiddler who, of course, went on writing to her for quite some time, but I took care of those letters.
They would only have caused her pain.
It's funny, looking back.
She was so easily deceived.
These romances are so fragile.
There's no real devotion at all.
Not such as we all had together, as a family, here at Chimneys.
She was unhappy.
Trapped.
No wonder she got ill.
But after she died, you found the earlier letters, didn't you, from the Captain?
She'd kept them safe, all these years.
Yes, indeed.
Every word.
So that when Mr Lomax showed you the letter from Count Ludwig, suggesting a visit to Chimneys you knew the handwriting at once.
A precise match for the old love letters.
And you knew...
The Captain was on his way.
But why the firework?
Why 11:45?
Mr Eversleigh, is it possible that the letter you wrote to Mr Cade was in fact left unsealed?
Your guest has arrived, sir.
Still on the desk?
Letters for posting on his Lordship's desk.
All that remained was to add the time.
You wrote and posted the letter to Cade yourself.
And staged the gunshot for 11:45 to incriminate Cade.
What better way to be rid of your enemies?
Frame one for the killing of the other.
Cade is no good.
You said as much yourself.
And as for this plan to ship you off to Africa...
Now, don't look at me like that.
You cannot build a marriage on lies.
Aren't you supposed to build it on love?
And Treadwell?
As we thought.
Poisoned not by the foxglove leaves... .. but by your tonic.
Active ingredient: digitalis.
A huge overdose.
I do regret that.
She was a faithful servant.
More faithful than you knew.
You were so fearful that she would tell the Inspector about the affair.
On the contrary.
She was taking measures to protect her mistress's secret.
As soon as Agnes's bones were recovered, she took the letters from amongst your possessions to her own room.
If I'd let her live, no-one would have found out.
Is that what you mean?
Well, that's it, then.
Not quite.
Daddy?
"Return one day for the greatest jewel. "
Stop.
What if this jewel was a diamond of a different kind?
Stop!
Whatever it is, we have a right to know.
A rose.
Not just any rose.
The Richmond rose.
"Richmond Twenty, North Three East. "
The Richmond referred to is not the portrait.
Precisely.
The rose of Richmond.
Ah.
Well, these directions, where did they lead?
One, two...
I don't understand.
Jane?
The Count's last words.
Do you remember?
Der Wand.
The wall.
We thought he meant the wall in the passageway.
But this Virginia creeper, when was it planted?
Madeleine planted it 23 years ago to celebrate your birth.
Virginia creeper.
He knew, I'm sure he did, as he lay dying.
The rose, the dance... .. it all made sense.
I think your mother wrote to the Count, shortly before she passed away.
The coded letter?
She didn't want the truth to die with her, not quite.
- So, you mean...
- You were the "greatest jewel".
He'd come to take you away.
My own little girl.
My darling girl.
He was my father?
No.
I feel, if you were to let go now...
I won't.
I'd just float off and...
I won't.
Come on.
No use putting off the inevitable.
Are you going to tell her or shall I?
Oh, I think it's best coming from me.
Blenkinsopp!
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
Bundle won't like that at all.
But you're not selling Chimneys?
Well, Bundle couldn't bear to stay on, and I don't want to live here, so what do you think?
Pass the whole headache on to Blenkinsopp and her tea and scones.
Why not?
Will she be all right?
Bundle, I mean.
Oh, she'll foist herself onto some undeserving cause.
Her father?
I suppose.
And you?
Here they come.
A happy marriage.
It can't be that difficult, can it?
Go with your heart.
Like mother?
I keep thinking, if she loved her Count so much, why was she so quick to believe he'd run off?
I suppose love is an act of courage.
Yes.
Miss Marple.
Goodbye, Inspector.
Thank you.
I see now I've grown too fond of my own reputation.
I was so bewitched by the blasted diamond.
And now look at me.
The latest of your casualties.
What do you think?
Interpol want me to take it to South Africa, entrap this villainous fellow from Pretoria.
You know, Inspector, I don't care for it at all.
Goodbye.

- Gojaa Ordonez
No, no, no.
Please, please.
No, no.
You mustn't go in there, please.
Listen to what I'm saying.
Please listen to me.
No, please, please.
Caterham, my dear chap, I wouldn't ask, only it's a matter of considerable national importance.
Isn't it always?
We've had the most tremendous approach from Vienna.
Go on.
Now the Austrians are a nice neutral bunch, they're very keen to be friends with us Brits.
- What's the offer?
- Iron ore.
We go in, help them put their heavy industry back on its feet, take home all the iron ore we need.
The PM can scarcely believe his luck.
Anyway, Vienna's sending over an envoy.
Count Ludwig.
I've been tasked with sitting the Count down, putting pen to paper and getting him to sign the contract.
Somewhere green and pleasant and, above all, discreet.
And you thought of Chimneys?
Well, you know, a weekend house party.
Good food, decent cellar.
Just like the old days, eh?
What do you say?
Do the ayes have it?
Well, actually, I was thinking of going on holiday next month.
Oh, nonsense.
Nobody goes on holiday in September.
Besides, we're practically family you and I.
Once we bring that girl of yours to her senses.
We're not as we were.
The house is in some disrepair.
Perfect.
Faded grandeur.
Adds to the flavour.
It'll need to be low-key.
Indeed so.
Intimate.
Discreet.
One or two guests, sensitively chosen.
Of course, these continentals are such fearful snobs.
I'll send my best chap round to help with the setting up.
Bill Eversleigh.
Yours to serve.
How do you do?
But why Chimneys?
It's years since we gave a party.
Decades.
Not since '32.
Show him the letter.
- The...?
- From Count Ludwig.
Here we are.
Fourth para.
Halfway down.
I have heard that Chimneys is the most prized house... ..in old England, and would count it a singular honour to see that jewelled palace for myself.
It is a memory I am most eager to cherish.
Sorry to drop in unannounced.
If you're gentle with me then I'll be gentle with you.
Agh!
Help!
Never, ever... ..touch mother's bicycle again.
Are you all right?
Can you stand?
- Oh, yes, I...
- Well, that's the main thing.
Once you're up on your pins, then life seems so...
Full of possibility.
Indeed.
Not that I was purely concerned about poor mother's bicycle, you understand.
Well, I should hope not.
I think the chap got the message, don't you?
And there he was, galloping in to save me on his iron horse.
I mean it really was the most idiotically chivalrous...
What?
Virginia.
You are as absurdly romantic as your dear mother.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
Woof woof.
Wrong tree.
If you honestly...
He couldn't be more unsuitable.
No cash, no prospects.
Oh, well, then.
Yes, quite.
Case closed.
And, anyway, he's been quite standoffish with me this past week.
I expect he's bored of me.
Don't you?
Oh, yes.
Does he have a name?
Sir Anthony Cade.
Only without the knighthood.
Oh, dear.
I was just thinking.
Your poor MP.
George Lomax won't be the least bit put off.
On the contrary.
Not another ultimatum?
I have until Sunday night to consent to be Mrs George Lomax.
Or what?
He invades Poland, I suppose.
Anyway, the terms are most generous.
He'll put daddy up in a mansion flat in town, which is all he wants since Mama passed away.
And he'll even pay to stop Chimneys from falling apart, which I suppose is jolly good for the family.
If you marry him.
I should be more grateful, obviously.
Well, I'm not sure gratitude is the basis for a happy marriage.
Well, no, no.
Not that I am any sort of expert.
No, Mummy always said you were the most eminently sensible of all her cousins.
Well, she certainly made a splendid marriage.
It should be so simple, shouldn't it, being happy?
I mean, one ought to see it, and just know.
Well, now that I've got you here we are going to have a riot, you and I.
- Are you game?
- Well, I'll do my best.
Well!
Are you quite sure it's all right with your father, having me along?
Oh, Daddy's thrilled.
And, anyway, you've had me down to St Mary Mead.
It's only fair I return the favour.
Here, look.
Page 17.
Isn't he a dish?
Anthony Cade.
Some passing whim.
Virginia is innocent, easily led.
It's all part of her charm.
- Yes, Treadwell?
- Your guest has arrived, sir.
Already?
Shoulders back.
Cometh the hour.
Watch and learn.
Letters for posting on his Lordship's table.
Send them express, if you'd be so kind.
Count Ludwig!
Oh, look.
He's practically licking his shoes.
The Count might think it's some sort of quaint British custom.
(Speaks German awkwardly)
A little early but so much the better.
Indeed, a lovely house, yes.
He seems like he's from another age.
I wonder if he speaks any English.
How much English do you need to sign a cheque?
Me metal.
You big, big dollars.
Daddy!
Virginia!
I didn't hear you come in.
Hello, Daddy!
So sorry, darling.
Ah, dear Jane.
Clement.
It's been...
Well...
Yes, not since the funeral.
You've been so kind to my daughter since we lost Madeleine.
How's your garden?
Hardly thriving, I'm afraid.
Daddy, you might have made a bit of an effort.
Oh, pay no attention to me.
I'm just the odd-job man these days.
Oh, look.
I see you've invited that nice lady from National Heritage.
Hilda Blenkinsopp?
No.
No.
Oh, no!
Now, Bundle, don't get cross.
She was very keen to be invited...
She's banned.
We agreed.
Yes, but the National Heritage have made a very sensible offer.
Chimneys has been in the family for centuries.
It is family.
Yes, but, darling, you know we can't afford to keep the place on.
We will manage.
We always do.
Well, she's on good form.
National Heritage has taken on 13 homes and gardens in the county.
High society, Eversleigh.
What did I say?
Embellish the scene, sir.
Embellish the scene.
Scientists.
Captains of industry...
What do you bring me?
Mrs Mop and Mrs Bucket.
Caterham says they're both first class if you get a bit of gin down them.
- Oh, does he?
- Problem?
Not at all.
Very diverse guest list.
Good.
Well, I should join in.
Was this your doing?
George will have to take us as he finds us.
- What?
- Marry me.
Bill.
Never propose on an empty stomach.
Ask me again after supper.
Don't you have to be somewhere?
Sultry, isn't it?
What have you done to your hair?
Not a thing.
Sweet of you to notice, darling.
You haven't forgotten that you promised me an answer by Sunday night?
The clock is ticking.
(Waltz)
Forgive me, but you all looked so perfect.
Like you had stepped out of a photograph.
Count Ludwig, allow me to introduce Clement Revel,
Ninth Marquis of Caterham.
- How do you do?
- The honour is entirely mine.
Gnädige, Damen.
And these are your two little Revels?
Would you indulge a fading guest?
Why not?
I've two left feet.
So why don't you try her?
Because everyone else seems to.
Oh, for a sense of rhythm.
Such a graceful dancer.
Well, they all are, aren't they?
Still, hardly the most practical accomplishment.
Is this your first visit to our shores?
No, I am an inveterate itinerant, I'm afraid.
Or I was, once upon a time.
Now you are laughing at me.
No, no, no, it's just your English.
Splendid.
I had a highly disciplined teacher, you see.
She taught me only tongue-twisters.
Inveterate itinerant.
Inveterate itinerant.
Inveterate itinerant!
Enough, I think...
Your dinner is getting cold.
Very good.
- Bundle, will you lead on?
- Yes, of course.
Miss Blenkinsopp, after you.
Follow me, ladies.
Very good, you're with us.
- Shall we?
- Oh.
A splendid dinner, thank you.
Yes, very filling.
Forgive my asking, sir.
Your interest in my house, is it for architecture?
No, no.
I have no head for grand design, for architecture.
- Your paintings...
- We sold most of the decent ones.
We still have our Van Dyck.
So I see.
- Who is this fellow?
- Some old duke.
Richmond.
Duke of.
Richmond.
Yes.
So if it's not the art, or the architecture, then...?
Oh, the history.
The great men rumoured to have met within these walls.
Treaties, affairs of state, wars, even, begun and ended here over coffee and cigars.
Oh, nothing so biblical, I assure you.
He's being modest, aren't you, Caterham?
Chimneys had quite a reputation.
So what happened?
- What was that?
- We ran into some bother.
Oh, the party of 1932?
Oh, that old yarn.
Well, we'd come back from an embassy posting.
Caracas.
It was my last one, as it turned out.
It was before Virginia was born.
Anyway, it was quite a night.
Your mother always gave wonderful parties, with a band out in the garden.
I remember the story, yes.
You were there yourself, weren't you, George?
Helping out.
I was accompanying Lady Somerset.
It was um... most instructive.
Is this it here?
- Yes.
- Where is that?
- The rose garden.
- Ah.
Our lovely Viennese waltz.
♪ La da-da, da-da dum
- Charming singing voice.
- Thank you.
Anyway, there was a bit of a to-do because the Duchess of Somerset had borrowed a large brooch for the evening.
- On her...
- Large brooch?
Daddy, it was the Mysore Diamond from India, possibly the most revered diamond in the world.
Well, whatever it was, by breakfast time it had disappeared.
Stolen.
By some good-for-nothing parlour maid named Agnes.
A parlour maid.
What an English saga!
The maid vanished overnight.
Isn't that right?
And the diamond was never ever to be found again.
- Anyone for more coffee?
- Oh, yes, please.
So what sort of girl was she, this Agnes?
Or did nobody notice?
Well, only 19 years old.
She must have lost her head, I suppose.
Anyway, it meant the end of my career in the diplomatic service.
All rather shameful.
Well, if the ladies can spare us...?
- To business.
- Indeed.
Yes.
I give you business.
You want our iron, Mr Lomax, MP?
Well, naturally.
I make one request.
Chimneys.
Give me Chimneys as a personal favour.
And, in return, I guarantee you can take home all the riches your heart desires.
- Well, I'm not sure...
- We are not for sale.
Not for sale.
Tell them.
Why don't you all try a hand of bridge?
- Oh, for God's sake.
- Yes.
It seems to be in order.
Now, Count, if you'd be kind enough to sign here.
With great pleasure.
(Rings bell) Mr Lomax!
Sir!
Jane!
What's happening?
I don't know.
What time is it?
If you'd all like to gather downstairs...
I'm sorry to have to wake you all up but one of Mr Lomax's security staff was found unconscious.
- Is that so?
That's right, sir.
Roberts.
- All present and correct, Eversleigh?
- Indeed so.
I believe we're one short.
- The Count.
- Out for the count.
That's no surprise, considering how he was knocking it back.
See if you can raise him.
- He's not in his room, sir.
- What?
Where is he?
Perhaps we need a search party.
Indeed.
Jaffers you and Roberts seal off the back door.
Bundle, the old servants' quarters.
You and Miss Blenkinsopp, the ground floor, and Virginia and I will look upstairs.
- Can't Virginia come with me?
- We don't have time for this.
Why do you always undermine me?
Will you two kindly desist?
Thank you.
Now, Virginia, can you run upstairs and collect his medicine?
Jane will remain here and keep an eye on him.
- Of course.
The rest of us can just as well look by ourselves.
Agreed?
I've brought your medicine.
Thank God for my darling girls.
Daddy?
(Bang)
George?
Not now!
- That sounded almost like...
- Was that a gunshot?
Someone close that door!
Well, where is he?
Any sign?
- Did you hear it?
- I think half the county heard it.
He can't have just vanished.
Are there no doorways, no outbuildings?
- You don't think...?
- Our little door.
Take that.
Should be torches on the wall.
Help yourself.
Come on, Jane.
- What is that?
Blood?
- Looks like it.
Anthony?
- I think he's been shot.
- What?
Want.
Want!
Count Ludwig?
Can you hear me?
- Is he breathing?
- Check his pulse.
Can you hear me?
- It wasn't me.
- I can't find a pulse.
- I think he's dead.
- It wasn't me!
Virginia!
Virginia!
Virginia!
He was such an enchanting man.
And he was our guest.
I'm sure there's a perfectly innocent explanation.
Virginia!
- I should go to him.
- Don't you dare.
Gin, come back.
- Virginia!
- Anthony.
- My love.
- Anthony!
- You can't go in, miss.
- May I at least speak to him?
- I'm sorry, miss.
- Oh, please.
Please.
Anthony, what are you even doing here?
Virginia...
You must promise me something.
Anything.
Please... promise me you'll forget me.
Anthony?
You're scaring me.
Anthony.
Finch.
Thank God.
Good to see you again.
Inspector Finch.
The guru of Scotland Yard.
Finch?
He looks quite like a cat, don't you think?
(Shouts) I loathe cats.
Ssh!
I gather he has devotees all over the Home Office.
They regard him as some sort of mystic.
A bit like Julian of Norwich, only with powers of arrest.
What do we know of the victim?
Born Vienna, 1892.
Wealthy parents.
Travelled about a good deal in his youth.
Something of a wandering spirit.
Entered politics soon after the war.
I can get my chap to find you a place in the town.
I shall be staying at Chimneys.
Murder rarely keeps office hours.
Hello.
Bit of fresh air.
Politically this could be a disaster, if not handled with care.
Indeed.
So the ladies retired early?
We had some business.
- Er... not relevant.
- He wanted to buy Chimneys.
He wanted to buy Chimneys?
Well, the proposal was that the government would purchase the house, and then pass it on to Count Ludwig as a gift.
- A bribe?
- Don't be absurd...
A personal bribe.
In return for which, he hands over a share of their heavy industry.
Where do we stand on that, morally?
Well back, I'd have thought.
Is there paperwork for this sale?
Signed, sealed and in my room in the top drawer.
All academic now, of course.
Understood.
As one door closes, another stands ajar, Lord Caterham.
Indeed.
So you gentlemen retired at...
About a quarter to eleven.
Until we were woken by the fire bell.
Mr Lomax!
Sir!
- At what time?
- Twenty to midnight.
We all met downstairs.
No sign of the Count.
So off we went, looking for him.
All save Clement and myself.
Next thing...
Boom!
The gunshot?
He was in the passageway all along.
Just a few yards away.
Any fingerprints on the weapon?
Regrettably not.
Still, we have the culprit.
Anthony Cade.
He has one or two questions to answer, certainly.
May I see the body?
I shall take you there at once.
Or perhaps Miss...
Marple.
Yes.
If it's no inconvenience?
Oh.
Well, no, not at all.
What was he doing here, almost an hour after he went to bed?
He showed an interest over dinner in the Van Dyck portrait.
I suppose the Count could have returned...
- A private viewing?
- I suppose.
And chanced upon the secret door?
Except that nothing quite happens by chance, does it?
Not really.
Or is that my tidy-minded preference?
I see you don't have a man with you.
I'm sorry?
Well, inspectors nowadays tend to have a man with them.
Perhaps you prefer to muse alone?
Perhaps no man would have me.
Oh.
This blood...
He was shot here.
And crawled, staggered, or was dragged this-a-way... ..where he was found in the arms of Mr Cade.
Here.
Before falling on poor Virginia.
Here.
All fairly straightforward, apparently.
Ah-ha.
Is it a letter?
Not quite.
A treble clef.
A virtuoso.
Perhaps you could take this and study it for me, Miss Marple.
Very well.
The Count said something before he died.
Want, want...
Want?
Are you sure?
Mm-hm.
Meaning?
Well, I suppose we all want something, even at death's door.
Kiss of life, perhaps?
How did you get here?
I climbed over the wall.
I was eager to get up to the house and this gentleman was blocking the path.
Would you mind, sir?
As I remember,
I came from around here.
Then I spotted the gentleman, I panicked, and then...
You hit him.
Yes, I am sorry about that.
Using this?
Exactly.
- What time was that?
- 11:33.
Precisely.
I remember because I looked at my watch.
I envy your eyesight, Mr Cade.
You see, that's the thing.
I know, because there was a light on in one of the upstairs rooms.
It was first storey and then second to the right.
Now, I can remember because someone had lit a fire.
Rather a warm night for a fire.
Well, there was definitely smoke coming out of the chimney above.
Anyway, at this stage common sense sounded the retreat.
Did you heed the warning?
Sadly, common sense and I are no longer on speaking terms so I carried on along here and through the door.
And then I came down here, opened the trap door
and then I heard the gunshot.
(Count groans) Good God!
- He'd been shot already?
- Yes.
- Any idea who shot him?
- Afraid not.
And yet, the revolver three feet from you, the victim at your heels?
I swear I never saw any revolver.
Mr Cade, may one ask what you were actually doing here?
Yes, well, I did wonder when you'd get around to asking that.
The truth is, I couldn't let Lomax have his way without putting up a fight.
- His way with Virginia?
- Yes.
I thought to myself: just sit tight and then burst in at breakfast and give you all a fright.
You certainly did that.
The constable found this in your pocket.
Oh.
Any idea who wrote it?
"Dear Cade, come to Chimneys.
There's a trapdoor in the garden.
11:45 sharp."
What?
I didn't write this.
Are you sure?
Mr Cade seems to think...
Not my style.
A love note is not something you just dash off.
I don't see what you're sniggering at.
I'm sorry - idiot - may I see?
Hand it over.
It appears from the postmark to have been sent locally, express service, as late as yesterday morning.
So, none of you sent this letter?
How's this for a hypothesis?
Cade types the letter himself, takes the train down to the village and posts it.
All in a cynical bid to ensnare Virginia.
Rubbish!
I was having tea with him yesterday morning.
At the Lyons Corner House on the Edgware Road.
And it was very nice.
Mr Lomax, your room is second from the end, isn't it?
So?
There was a light on there last night.
Just before the alarm sounded.
Rubbish!
Says who?
Oh.
Cade.
Blatant attempt to put you off your game, Inspector.
Anthony.
I told you.
I'm not worth the sacrifice.
I'll be the judge of that, thank you very much.
If you would be so good as to remain at Chimneys until further notice.
What about him?
You're not going to let him wander about?
We'll keep an eye on him.
Keep an eye on all of you.
It's quite perverse, isn't it?
He was such a musical fellow.
Quite the dancer.
I always say the point of a tune is to boost the morale, surely?
Indeed.
- May I help?
- Ah, Treadwell, the very man.
Where is that musical handbook of Virginia's?
You know the one?
Hits Of The Blitz?
The very nelly.
Come.
No...
Oh.
Hard at it, Miss Marple?
Inspector, it's...
I'm a little lost.
One can hardly see where one bar ends and the next begins.
I'm sorry, forgive me.
It's...
Hardly music at all.
Could it be...
I almost wonder...
Forgive me.
Go on.
Well, I wonder, is it possible, it is, in fact, a message of some sort in code?
I've tried to be patient...
What were you thinking of?
You know nothing about the man or his people.
I know he's funny and reckless and his mother has a jolly nice bicycle, which I happen to think counts for more than a dozen columns in Who's Who.
- He ran a bar.
- Oh, how philanthropic.
In Africa.
He had a friend, they were business partners.
And does this friend have a name?
Jimmy McGrath.
They did rather well, for a time, but Jimmy liked to drink, you see.
He gambled it all away.
Lost it in one sitting to a gentleman from Pretoria.
You've known him for less than a fortnight.
Daddy.
- Ah, Caterham.
Knock some sense into your daughter.
Oh, well it's a brave man who'd dare to.
What would your mother have said?
My mother, you presume to speak about, always went with her heart.
Isn't that so?
And she raised me to do the same.
Virginia!
- Anthony is no murderer.
What's she doing?
Trying to prove her lover innocent.
How does she propose to do that?
I have no idea.
Like it or not, Mr Cade was there, in the tunnel, with the smoking gun.
Will you arrest him?
- I'm tempted.
He's careless, all the lies he tells.
The letter, that business with the light on in the house...
A man like Cade requires plenty of rope.
Like most of us.
Even you.
Am I under suspicion?
I know your secret, Miss Marple.
You are a puzzle-outer of mysteries.
I muddle through one or two.
It's a matter of association.
I envy you, you know, the amateur sleuth.
One has nothing to lose, somehow.
Still, a salary is er...
convenient.
Indeed.
If it wasn't for the generosity of my nephew...
Raymond.
So I've read in a dozen case files.
Yes.
Hardly a distinguished name.
- Raymond?
- No.
Chimneys.
Until it stands before one, and then it all makes sense.
Dozens of them.
Splendid.
That great tower standing proud, so that...
Which was the window Mr Cade said was lit up on the night of the murder?
Second from the right?
The MP's room.
And yet, as one approaches the spot where Mr Cade stood, a window is obscured.
Do you see?
On account of the tower.
So that what appears to be second from the right is, in fact...
Third from the right.
So who was up and about moments before the gunshot?
At 33 minutes past 11 your bedroom light was on, 12 minutes before the gunshot.
Yes.
Briefly.
Can you tell me why?
I wished to speak to Count Ludwig, but noticing his bed was unoccupied, I returned to my room.
Any particular reason for wishing to speak to him?
Oh, he'd... earlier in the evening he'd asked for an extra blanket.
So perhaps you lit a fire?
I beg your pardon?
At the same time. 11:33.
No fires last night.
I...
I would have known, you see.
You know, it's funny, but yesterday I really felt that you knew him.
This looks a very grand affair.
That's how they did it in those days.
And this would be the orchestra, at the back here?
What sort of music did they play?
Waltzes, mainly.
Viennese waltzes?
It's him, isn't it?
There.
Count Ludwig.
So he has been here before.
And where else but in the orchestra?
What brought you back after all these years?
Any thoughts, Miss Treadwell?
He got no more than he deserved.
I'm sorry?
The girl who...
Who disappeared?
Agnes.
The parlour maid, yes.
Whatever happened to Agnes?
That night after the party, I...
I saw a light...
This was the tomb I saw opened.
Her body, it was down there.
Let me help you.
Clement, are you sure?
Agnes.
Her apron.
Poor child.
All this time, we said she was the thief.
I think it's time you told us what happened.
The mistress, she confided in me once.
Madeleine?
What did she tell you?
She said Agnes was with him that night.
With whom?
A musician.
A fiddle player.
Oh, the Count?
All these years.
Not a word.
I wanted to, sir.
But I thought if I spoke out, you would contact the police, and there would be more of a scandal.
It had already ruined your career and if a stolen jewel could cast such a shadow, and then the theft of a life...
I'm so sorry.
Oh, what have I done?
I'm so sorry.
- Well?
- She's certainly hiding something.
Damn.
Oh.
Wondered if there was any...
- What?
Cardboard.
Wondered if there was any...
What are you...?
What do you want cardboard for?
- I'm making something.
Well, I can't see any, so if you wouldn't mind.
What are you up to, Miss Blenkinsopp?
Just looking for some privacy in this big, old nasty... house.
Hands off.
Sorry.
I'll leave you to it.
Oh, it's child's play.
It's musical mathematics.
Don't you see?
One simply transposes the music from notes into letters.
So two octaves... take us from A up to O, while these 11 sharps bring us all the way up to Z.
Your coded letter.
# La!
La-la!
Please, I cannot abide flattery.
Thank you, Lady Revel.
Thank you.
Very well.
- Thank you, Bundle.
"For this reason,"
my beloved Captain...
I can never see you again.
Promise me you will return one day for the greatest jewel.
"Richmond Twenty, North Three East."
A love letter in the dead man's pocket.
Incomplete.
If we had a couple more pages...
A date'd be helpful.
Though the manuscript was written in ballpoint pen.
Indeed.
So, the last couple of years.
Yes.
A farewell?
"Beloved Captain." Captain?
An alias for Count Ludwig, if this affair was to be kept quiet?
The Count had a secret lover.
Agnes?
Perhaps.
But what do we make of this?
"Promise me you will return one day for the greatest jewel."
Is it possible...?
Count Ludwig came here to Chimneys not to discuss iron, but on a secret mission, revealed within this letter, to recover the stolen Mysore Diamond located somewhere in this house.
No wonder it's in code.
That's why he wanted to buy Chimneys.
"Richmond Twenty, North Three East."
The evidence was before our eyes.
The Van Dyck?
And the subject?
The Duke of Richmond.
18, 19, 20.
So?
So.
Don't torment me, Inspector.
If you're holding something back...
Want, want...
His last words.
Unless, of course...
Vunt, vunt...
Unless of course he was speaking not English, but his mother tongue.
Not "want, want" but "vunt, vunt".
"Der Wand" in High German.
Or "vunt" in the Austrian dialect.
Meaning?
The wall, the wall.
You think...?
You think the diamond is hidden somewhere in the wall?
Well.
Bravo.
But, you know, I think I know a gentleman who might shed a little more light on the matter.
You were accompanying your godmother?
Lady...
Lady Somerset.
That's right.
We all used to call her Robbie.
Must have been quite bewitching.
What?
The diamond.
Oh.
I see.
Well, it's all just coloured glass to me, Inspector.
What have you got there?
Notes from the investigation in '32.
Interviews with, among others, yourself.
"I have no recollection of said diamond's disappearance.
In fact, I was asleep."
I'd been charging about since dawn.
Really, Inspector...
I see Lady Somerset retired early as well.
We had nothing to do with any theft, I assure you.
The point is...
See for yourself.
I was a young rake.
She was easily led.
I see.
Well, at least, I have an inkling.
And he was writing under a nom de plume.
Count Ludwig had an alias?
Mm-hm.
The Captain.
Odd.
And a secret lover, to boot.
It's all in the letter.
Who was she, the lover?
We wondered.
Agnes?
Poor Agnes.
Not only that.
The Count seems to have had a hand in the theft of the famous diamond.
So he bumped her off, did he?
Two thieves fighting over the spoils?
Well, do start away, everyone.
Yes, and she wasn't the only one, was she?
The only victim, I mean.
Bill, where is the...?
Right here, my dearest.
Chimneys.
It's not quite to scale, I'm afraid.
The night of the murder.
We all came downstairs.
Yes?
And we couldn't find the Count, so off we all went.
Separately.
Now, this is the point.
This is where we all were.
So, Bundle, you were upstairs in the guest wing.
George was there also.
Treadwell, kitchen.
Miss Blenkinsopp, I believe, was on the terrace.
Bill - study and I was upstairs then down to the council chamber.
Then...
Gunshot!
Back we all flew, front door wide open.
Someone close that door!
Agreed?
Who's to say one of us couldn't have run out of the house through the garden, trapdoor, into the passage, shot the Count and then one minute to get back, after the gunshot, in time to make it look like... well, to make it look like we'd been in the house all along?
Front door to the trapdoor is...
How many strides, Bill?
We measured it. 112?
- 112.
Five minutes there and back.
It's possible.
You said so yourself, didn't you, Bill?
Sure.
But why would anybody...?
The Count wanted Chimneys, didn't he?
And, Bundle, you're so mortally opposed to losing the house.
I had no idea I was so pathetically grasping.
Well, somebody killed him.
And as for that poor dead girl...
My little fox.
What you need is fattening up.
Enough.
Quite.
You making notes, Blenkinsopp?
No.
To think, what a pleasing oral history this will all make back in your municipal headquarters.
Not at all.
When everyone knows you've had your claws in Chimneys for years, grubbing about with your letters and your polite notices, rifling through our drawers, tipping off our creditors.
Mother was on her death bed, not that you lost a moment's sleep over that.
- God knows why.
- I'll tell you why.
I caught her in the study, going through the old housekeeping records, weren't you?
1932.
This is all about Agnes, isn't it?
You knew her?
Agnes Parker was a child, a child when she was handed over to people like you.
Trusted to your care.
And when one morning she wasn't there, it broke her family's heart.
And not one of you had the decency to ask why.
I feel sick.
- Well, you might.
No, I feel sick.
Clement?
It's his ticker.
Where's your tonic?
Your tonic!
Excuse me.
There's hardly any left.
Just take a swig.
- Excuse me.
- Damn soup.
Let's get some fresh air.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so terribly sorry.
What kind of soup is this, Miss Treadwell?
Mushroom and sage.
But you are quite well.
Oh, I have no appetite by nightfall.
One of the hidden costs of old age.
Miss Treadwell, help me here.
Are you quite sure in your mind that the Count murdered poor Agnes?
If there's anything else, then, please...?
It's been so many years.
- Can this not wait until the morning?
- No.
Fuse wire.
What's that doing there?
Indeed.
Dear me, what a business.
Ah, yes.
Foxglove leaves.
Easily muddled with sage.
Must have found their way into the soup.
- Foxglove, you see, contains...
- Digitalis.
Natural poison.
I'll be indoors.
Sorry.
Jane.
Here to rebuke me?
Castigate away.
No.
Your sister's account of last night.
Please don't mind Ginny.
Her nerves are shot.
I noticed that you were upstairs, here in the guest wing, during the search party, and I wondered what became of them.
Of...?
The legal paperwork, drawn up last night for the sale of Chimneys, which you took from Mr Lomax's room.
Oh, that.
Old maid's last refuge, isn't it?
An overweening love of domestic animals.
Not that they ever reciprocated.
It was always Treadwell.
Every dog and pup we ever had.
She used to give them the funniest names.
There's really no need to stay, sir.
No, I'm fine.
She had a weak heart?
Well, not that I knew.
I wondered merely why the poison in the foxglove leaves should prove lethal for her while the rest of us...
Well... she was a terrible worrier.
Shanghai. '27.
She travelled about with us everywhere.
And this one?
Oh...
Do you know, I have no idea.
Our friend the Captain.
All of them?
Looks like it.
And not in musical code.
Not this one.
Who was he writing to?
Constance?
She was with us for so many years.
One forgot she even had a Christian name.
Constance Treadwell.
I was so sure she was holding something from us.
Constance was Count Ludwig's lover?
My dearest Constance.
Nine days until the party at the Palazzo Ducale.
It feels like a prison sentence...
It has rained every day since Caracas.
The Captain.
I am mad, Bedlamised, with love.
But the lamb is stamping her little hooves.
I must sign off now.
Be of courage.
Until Friday and Chimneys.
All my love.
Our glorious reunion.
I will take you in my arms.
"And we will make such light-fingered music."
Treadwell?
I suppose she had much to lose.
Her position, her livelihood.
And when love is driven underground, it quickens its ardour.
Oh, we had a case with our organist and a young page turner at St Mary Mead.
I see.
Well, one mustn't talk scandal.
Places and times.
Venice, Caracas.
He must have trailed her for two years at least.
All the way to Chimneys.
- Back to the party.
But Treadwell, a diamond thief?
Well, perhaps it was the Captain who urged her to do it?
What is the "lamb" in these letters?
- That's...
- Well, I think...
I'm so sorry.
You first.
Agnes.
Old papist word for lamb.
Agnes Dei.
Lamb of God.
Altar boy.
Misspent youth.
So, safe to conclude Agnes Parker was the courier, ferrying letters between Constance Treadwell and her "Captain".
And then, on the night of the party in '32, the theft of the Mysore Diamond...
Agnes is murdered.
Wildly circumstantial, but the messenger, murdered by Count Ludwig because she found out about the theft?
She knew too much, the Count buries her in the crypt, and, of course, everyone assumes that Agnes has stolen the diamond.
And then, years later, the two lovers dead themselves.
Or murdered.
That wretched soup.
Which begs the question...
How can the same dish kill one of us while provoking mere unpleasantness in the rest?
The foxgloves tossed into the soup by the killer to convince us that Miss Treadwell's death was an accident.
But, in fact, she was poisoned by something else.
But what?
- I have no idea.
- Pity.
And who among us, I wonder, has been quickest to defend poor Agnes Parker?
Yes.
I was at school with her.
They lived on our street.
This whole business with Agnes, well...
It's how they treat them, isn't it?
You never believed Agnes stole the Mysore Diamond in '32, did you?
Of course not.
But I didn't knock anyone off.
And I certainly don't know anything about any poison.
Digi... digi...
And yet here you are... on the terrace.
Count Ludwig!
Quite alone.
No witnesses.
What do we think?
Could it be that Miss Blenkinsopp climbed into the passage, fired the gunshot... ..then back in the house?
I don't think so.
Not with my asthma.
And yet, you saw something, didn't you?
Yes.
I realise now it must have been Cade I saw in the garden.
It did seem odd behaviour for a security guard.
I could have said something, cried for help.
I could have stopped it, but I just stood there.
You're absolutely right, Inspector.
I fear Mr Cade is running out of rope.
Mr Eversleigh.
Here we are.
"Dear Cade.
Come to Chimneys."
There's a trapdoor in the garden.
"11:45 sharp."
Patent falsehood.
Yes, well.
Note the capital C?
The letter has a little crack in it.
Do you see?
And again here, the same little crack.
So?
The note to Mr Cade appears to have been written on this very typewriter.
Which you yourself were using on the very morning the letter was dispatched.
Oh, I see.
You wrote this, didn't you?
Yes.
Well, some of it, anyway.
But I don't remember anything about 11:45.
But your purpose in writing the letter?
To help Mr Cade gain access to Chimneys?
How long have you been acquainted with Mr Cade?
Couple of weeks.
I lost rather heavily at cards.
My pet vice, losing heavily at cards.
I get so crashingly bored in the office.
There's a little room run in Aldwych, pontoon, poker for the die-hards.
How much did you lose?
97 quid.
Anyway, in walked Cade.
Said he could cover the debt.
He said we could help each other out.
Go on.
So, this gentleman from Pretoria who's holding your friend?
He has a pet passion.
Diamonds?
Yes.
The Mysore Diamond?
He gave me six weeks to bring him the real McCoy or Jimmy's life would be forfeit.
So you staged the street assault to endear yourself to Virginia?
Yes.
Posing as the good Samaritan to creep into the affections of an innocent young woman.
George, please, my head is splitting.
And the assailant?
Agh!
Sorry.
But your real purpose was to gain access to Chimneys, where the diamond was first hidden.
I am a decent man.
Pah.
A decent man who did a stupid thing.
I had no choice.
Ditto.
Absolutely.
Anthony Cade, I am arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Count Ludwig Von Stainach.
Get out!
I love you.
And you.
Really?
Nobody say anything, please.
Just for a moment.
I think, despite everything, that this must be my favourite room in the world.
It was out of bounds as a boy, so naturally it was where one longed to be.
And this heraldic brute.
Oh, the battles we fought, through shot and shell.
Armies, dragons, the whole works.
Then one summer, 12 years old, just tall enough to open his visor, my brother in arms was nothing at all.
Just empty air.
If this is you gently breaking the news that Anthony Cade is no knight in shining armour, consider me rudely awoken.
No, no.
I'm saying that love is its own adventure.
Take no-one for granted, not even those closest to home.
- Jane, help me.
- No, no.
I know what you're saying.
Wish me luck.
Excuse me, George.
Sorry to barge in on matters of state.
I accept.
I beg your pardon?
- The offer.
If it's still open.
I know how sticky you are about ultimata.
But...
Cade?
Oh.
That was a dream I had.
I'm awake now.
Well, I'm delighted to hear it.
Well, well.
The first of many.
A drink.
Champagne.
A toast!
What are you doing?
Get off him!
You stay there.
Virginia!
Virginia!
A toast.
To us.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
What on earth was that?
It came from inside the house.
In the passageway.
Sir, Cade's escaped.
Try the trapdoor.
It's stuck.
Virginia!
Virginia!
Mr Cade, all this isn't going to look very bright in court.
Virginia!
I want you to know.
I want to give you something - the diamond.
Not that I give a damn.
You're the only prize worth dying for.
And it's got to be here somewhere.
And when I find it, it's yours.
Do you hear?
Anthony!
Got it!
Get off me.
He couldn't even get that right.
What's he trying to prove?
Well, he has proven one thing.
- Oh?
- His innocence.
May I show you?
We were all standing just where we were the moment of the fatal gunshot.
Agreed?
- Indeed.
- Everything just as it was?
No.
The gunshot, it was too quiet.
Yes, it was much quieter, Inspector.
Like Mr Cade's hammering a few moments ago, whereas the sound we thought was the gunshot made my ears ring.
Mr Cade, you remember, out in the garden, what did he see on that warm night?
Someone had lit a fire.
And then that off-cut of flex that had no business being in the compost.
A piece of fuse, Inspector.
The Count's killer lit something in the chimney that evening.
On a slow fuse, timed to explode 15 minutes later, to deceive us all that what we heard was a gunshot when what we, in fact, heard was a firework.
What was it you said, Inspector?
"Like it or not, Anthony Cade was found in that tunnel with the smoking gun."
But what if the gun was not smoking?
What if the Count was killed earlier than supposed, after the men retired from their business at quarter to eleven but before the alarm bell almost an hour later?
Suddenly, the killer could be any one of us.
Are you sure?
You recall the Count's interest, over dinner, in The Duke Of Richmond?
No great feat to quietly invite the Count back after the rest of us were in bed, show him the hidden bolt, tempt him inside, then shoot him, and toss the gun to be found later as if abandoned by the killer.
Sadly for the Count, he didn't die straightaway.
The murderer's only mistake, if mistake it was.
Good God!
The poor man was still living when Mr Cade found him some time later.
Go on, Jane.
Those letters...
I've been woefully, unforgivably naive.
Constance and the Captain - ah, the romance of it.
One gets swept along and yet...
Let me pose a question.
A pair of lovers, determined to hide their secret, might they not write under an alias?
Indeed, Count Ludwig called himself the Captain.
So he did.
But why just the Count and not Constance?
Did she not fear exposure as much as him?
Unless Constance was also an alias.
So the Constance of the letters was not Treadwell?
Forgive me, Bundle.
I took this from your scrapbook.
It's a dog.
So what?
Well, it's Mama's first mutt.
Captain.
It was called Captain.
It was so besotted with Treadwell Mama used to joke they were like...
"Perfect lovers."
Our mother must have thought of these aliases.
Constance and her Captain.
Our mother...
Took the alias "Constance".
Your mother was the Count's secret lover.
I don't understand.
Are you saying that the Count and Madeleine stole the diamond?
Oh, that wretched diamond.
We're all so bewitched by the Mysore Diamond, we forge our theories and forget the facts.
It is so important to see things clearly, as if through a pane of glass, and not a prism.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Good God.
May I?
I'm afraid there's no way the Count murdered Agnes and made off with the diamond.
Because the diamond has been with Agnes all the time.
In the tomb, just where the killer left it.
When we found poor Agnes's bones, do you remember?
Your histrionics in the crypt.
You took it then, didn't you?
Then dropped it in the fountain.
Why else would you be drying your hands?
Daddy?
Why?
The night of the party.
'32.
I'd lost a cufflink, if you can believe it.
I went upstairs and then...
No, no, you mustn't go in there, please.
Please, sir, listen to what I'm saying.
I'd not meant to kill her, but she tried to prevent me from seeing my wife and the fiddle player.
And then my mind cleared.
I took the diamond.
Left it with Agnes.
Naturally it was assumed that she had run off with it.
Then all that remained was to tell my wife a white lie.
You told her Agnes had been seen.
Cavorting with the Viennese fiddler who, of course, went on writing to her for quite some time, but I took care of those letters.
They would only have caused her pain.
It's funny, looking back.
She was so easily deceived.
These romances are so fragile.
There's no real devotion at all.
Not such as we all had together, as a family, here at Chimneys.
She was unhappy.
Trapped.
No wonder she got ill.
But after she died, you found the earlier letters, didn't you, from the Captain?
She'd kept them safe, all these years.
Yes, indeed.
Every word.
So that when Mr Lomax showed you the letter from Count Ludwig, suggesting a visit to Chimneys you knew the handwriting at once.
A precise match for the old love letters.
And you knew...
The Captain was on his way.
But why the firework?
Why 11:45?
Mr Eversleigh, is it possible that the letter you wrote to Mr Cade was in fact left unsealed?
Your guest has arrived, sir.
Still on the desk?
Letters for posting on his Lordship's desk.
All that remained was to add the time.
You wrote and posted the letter to Cade yourself.
And staged the gunshot for 11:45 to incriminate Cade.
What better way to be rid of your enemies?
Frame one for the killing of the other.
Cade is no good.
You said as much yourself.
And as for this plan to ship you off to Africa...
Now, don't look at me like that.
You cannot build a marriage on lies.
Aren't you supposed to build it on love?
And Treadwell?
As we thought.
Poisoned not by the foxglove leaves... ..but by your tonic.
Active ingredient: digitalis.
A huge overdose.
I do regret that.
She was a faithful servant.
More faithful than you knew.
You were so fearful that she would tell the Inspector about the affair.
On the contrary.
She was taking measures to protect her mistress's secret.
As soon as Agnes's bones were recovered, she took the letters from amongst your possessions to her own room.
If I'd let her live, no-one would have found out.
Is that what you mean?
Well, that's it, then.
Not quite.
Daddy?
"Return one day for the greatest jewel."
Stop.
What if this jewel was a diamond of a different kind?
Stop!
Whatever it is, we have a right to know.
A rose.
Not just any rose.
The Richmond rose.
"Richmond Twenty, North Three East."
The Richmond referred to is not the portrait.
Precisely.
The rose of Richmond.
Ah.
Well, these directions, where did they lead?
One, two...
I don't understand.
Jane?
The Count's last words.
Do you remember?
Der Wand.
The wall.
We thought he meant the wall in the passageway.
But this Virginia creeper, when was it planted?
Madeleine planted it 23 years ago to celebrate your birth.
Virginia creeper.
He knew, I'm sure he did, as he lay dying.
The rose, the dance... ..it all made sense.
I think your mother wrote to the Count, shortly before she passed away.
The coded letter?
She didn't want the truth to die with her, not quite.
- So, you mean...
- You were the "greatest jewel".
He'd come to take you away.
My own little girl.
My darling girl.
He was my father?
I feel, if you were to let go now...
I won't.
I'd just float off and...
I won't.
Come on.
No use putting off the inevitable.
Are you going to tell her or shall I?
Oh, I think it's best coming from me.
Blenkinsopp!
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
Bundle won't like that at all.
But you're not selling Chimneys?
Well, Bundle couldn't bear to stay on, and I don't want to live here, so what do you think?
Pass the whole headache on to Blenkinsopp and her tea and scones.
Why not?
Will she be all right?
Bundle, I mean.
Oh, she'll foist herself onto some undeserving cause.
Her father?
I suppose.
And you?
Here they come.
A happy marriage.
It can't be that difficult, can it?
Go with your heart.
Like mother?
I keep thinking, if she loved her Count so much, why was she so quick to believe he'd run off?
I suppose love is an act of courage.
Yes.
Miss Marple.
Goodbye, Inspector.
Thank you.
I see now I've grown too fond of my own reputation.
I was so bewitched by the blasted diamond.
And now look at me.
The latest of your casualties.
What do you think?
Interpol want me to take it to South Africa, entrap this villainous fellow from Pretoria.
You know, Inspector, I don't care for it at all.
Goodbye.

(Waltz)
(Fireworks explode)
No, no, no.
Please, please.
No, no.
You mustn't go in there, please.
Listen to what I'm saying.
Please listen to me.
No, please, please.
(Cries out)
Caterham, my dear chap, I wouldn't ask, only it's a matter of considerable national importance.
Isn't it always?
We've had the most tremendous approach from Vienna.
Go on.
Now the Austrians are a nice neutral bunch, they're very keen to be friends with us Brits.
- What's the offer?
- Iron ore.
We go in, help them put their heavy industry back on its feet, take home all the iron ore we need.
The PM can scarcely believe his luck.
Anyway, Vienna's sending over an envoy.
Count Ludwig.
I've been tasked with sitting the Count down, putting pen to paper and getting him to sign the contract.
Somewhere green and pleasant and, above all, discreet.
And you thought of Chimneys?
Well, you know, a weekend house party.
Good food, decent cellar.
Just like the old days, eh?
What do you say?
Do the ayes have it?
Well, actually, I was thinking of going on holiday next month.
Oh, nonsense.
Nobody goes on holiday in September.
Besides, we're practically family you and I.
Once we bring that girl of yours to her senses.
We're not as we were.
The house is in some disrepair.
Perfect.
Faded grandeur.
Adds to the flavour.
It'll need to be low-key.
Indeed so.
Intimate.
Discreet.
One or two guests, sensitively chosen.
Of course, these continentals are such fearful snobs.
I'll send my best chap round to help with the setting up.
Bill Eversleigh.
Yours to serve.
How do you do?
But why Chimneys?
It's years since we gave a party.
Decades.
Not since '32.
Show him the letter.
- The...?
- From Count Ludwig.
Here we are.
Fourth para.
Halfway down.
I have heard that Chimneys is the most prized house...
COUNT: ..in old England, and would count it a singular honour to see that jewelled palace for myself.
It is a memory I am most eager to cherish.
Sorry to drop in unannounced.
If you're gentle with me then I'll be gentle with you.
Agh!
Help!
Never, ever... ..touch mother's bicycle again.
Are you all right?
Can you stand?
- Oh, yes, I...
- Well, that's the main thing.
Once you're up on your pins, then life seems so...
Full of possibility.
Indeed.
Not that I was purely concerned about poor mother's bicycle, you understand.
Well, I should hope not.
I think the chap got the message, don't you?
And there he was, galloping in to save me on his iron horse.
I mean it really was the most idiotically chivalrous...
What?
Virginia.
You are as absurdly romantic as your dear mother.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
Woof woof.
Wrong tree.
If you honestly...
He couldn't be more unsuitable.
No cash, no prospects.
Oh, well, then.
Yes, quite.
Case closed.
And, anyway, he's been quite standoffish with me this past week.
I expect he's bored of me.
Don't you?
Oh, yes.
Does he have a name?
Sir Anthony Cade.
Only without the knighthood.
Oh, dear.
I was just thinking.
Your poor MP.
George Lomax won't be the least bit put off.
On the contrary.
Not another ultimatum?
I have until Sunday night to consent to be Mrs George Lomax.
Or what?
He invades Poland, I suppose.
Anyway, the terms are most generous.
He'll put daddy up in a mansion flat in town, which is all he wants since Mama passed away.
And he'll even pay to stop Chimneys from falling apart, which I suppose is jolly good for the family.
If you marry him.
I should be more grateful, obviously.
Well, I'm not sure gratitude is the basis for a happy marriage.
Well, no, no.
Not that I am any sort of expert.
No, Mummy always said you were the most eminently sensible of all her cousins.
Well, she certainly made a splendid marriage.
It should be so simple, shouldn't it, being happy?
I mean, one ought to see it, and just know.
Well, now that I've got you here we are going to have a riot, you and I.
- Are you game?
- Well, I'll do my best.
Well!
Are you quite sure it's all right with your father, having me along?
Oh, Daddy's thrilled.
And, anyway, you've had me down to St Mary Mead.
It's only fair I return the favour.
Here, look.
Page 17.
Isn't he a dish?
Anthony Cade.
Some passing whim.
Virginia is innocent, easily led.
It's all part of her charm.
- Yes, Treadwell?
- Your guest has arrived, sir.
Already?
Shoulders back.
Cometh the hour.
Watch and learn.
Letters for posting on his Lordship's table.
Send them express, if you'd be so kind.
Count Ludwig!
Oh, look.
He's practically licking his shoes.
The Count might think it's some sort of quaint British custom.
(Laughter)
(Speaks German awkwardly)
A little early but so much the better.
Indeed, a lovely house, yes.
He seems like he's from another age.
I wonder if he speaks any English.
How much English do you need to sign a cheque?
Me metal.
You big, big dollars.
Daddy!
Virginia!
I didn't hear you come in.
Hello, Daddy!
So sorry, darling.
Ah, dear Jane.
Clement.
It's been...
Well...
Yes, not since the funeral.
You've been so kind to my daughter since we lost Madeleine.
How's your garden?
Hardly thriving, I'm afraid.
Daddy, you might have made a bit of an effort.
Oh, pay no attention to me.
I'm just the odd-job man these days.
Oh, look.
I see you've invited that nice lady from National Heritage.
Hilda Blenkinsopp?
No.
No.
Oh, no!
Now, Bundle, don't get cross.
She was very keen to be invited...
She's banned.
We agreed.
Yes, but the National Heritage have made a very sensible offer.
Chimneys has been in the family for centuries.
It is family.
Yes, but, darling, you know we can't afford to keep the place on.
We will manage.
We always do.
Well, she's on good form.
National Heritage has taken on 13 homes and gardens in the county.
High society, Eversleigh.
What did I say?
Embellish the scene, sir.
Embellish the scene.
Scientists.
Captains of industry...
What do you bring me?
Mrs Mop and Mrs Bucket.
Caterham says they're both first class if you get a bit of gin down them.
- Oh, does he?
- Problem?
Not at all.
Very diverse guest list.
Good.
Well, I should join in.
(Chuckles)
Was this your doing?
George will have to take us as he finds us.
- What?
- Marry me.
Bill.
Never propose on an empty stomach.
Ask me again after supper.
Don't you have to be somewhere?
Sultry, isn't it?
What have you done to your hair?
Not a thing.
Sweet of you to notice, darling.
You haven't forgotten that you promised me an answer by Sunday night?
The clock is ticking.
(Waltz)
Forgive me, but you all looked so perfect.
Like you had stepped out of a photograph.
Count Ludwig, allow me to introduce Clement Revel,
Ninth Marquis of Caterham.
- How do you do?
- The honour is entirely mine.
Gnädige, Damen.
And these are your two little Revels?
Would you indulge a fading guest?
Why not?
I've two left feet.
So why don't you try her?
Because everyone else seems to.
Oh, for a sense of rhythm.
Such a graceful dancer.
Well, they all are, aren't they?
Still, hardly the most practical accomplishment.
Is this your first visit to our shores?
No, I am an inveterate itinerant, I'm afraid.
Or I was, once upon a time.
(Laughs)
Now you are laughing at me.
No, no, no, it's just your English.
Splendid.
I had a highly disciplined teacher, you see.
She taught me only tongue-twisters.
Inveterate itinerant.
BOTH:
Inveterate itinerant.
Inveterate itinerant!
LOMAX:
Enough, I think...
Your dinner is getting cold.
Very good.
- Bundle, will you lead on?
- Yes, of course.
Miss Blenkinsopp, after you.
Follow me, ladies.
Very good, you're with us.
- Shall we?
- Oh.
(Clock chimes)
COUNT:
A splendid dinner, thank you.
Yes, very filling.
Forgive my asking, sir.
Your interest in my house, is it for architecture?
No, no.
I have no head for grand design, for architecture.
- Your paintings...
- We sold most of the decent ones.
We still have our Van Dyck.
So I see.
- Who is this fellow?
- Some old duke.
Richmond.
Duke of.
Richmond.
Yes.
So if it's not the art, or the architecture, then...?
Oh, the history.
The great men rumoured to have met within these walls.
Treaties, affairs of state, wars, even, begun and ended here over coffee and cigars.
Oh, nothing so biblical, I assure you.
He's being modest, aren't you, Caterham?
Chimneys had quite a reputation.
So what happened?
- What was that?
- We ran into some bother.
Oh, the party of 1932?
Oh, that old yarn.
Well, we'd come back from an embassy posting.
Caracas.
It was my last one, as it turned out.
It was before Virginia was born.
Anyway, it was quite a night.
Your mother always gave wonderful parties, with a band out in the garden.
I remember the story, yes.
You were there yourself, weren't you, George?
Helping out.
I was accompanying Lady Somerset.
It was um...most instructive.
Is this it here?
- Yes.
- Where is that?
- The rose garden.
- Ah.
Our lovely Viennese waltz.
♪ La da-da, da-da dum
- Charming singing voice.
- Thank you.
Anyway, there was a bit of a to-do because the Duchess of Somerset had borrowed a large brooch for the evening.
- On her...
- Large brooch?
Daddy, it was the Mysore Diamond from India, possibly the most revered diamond in the world.
Well, whatever it was, by breakfast time it had disappeared.
Stolen.
By some good-for-nothing parlour maid named Agnes.
A parlour maid.
What an English saga!
The maid vanished overnight.
Isn't that right?
And the diamond was never ever to be found again.
- Anyone for more coffee?
- Oh, yes, please.
So what sort of girl was she, this Agnes?
Or did nobody notice?
Well, only 19 years old.
She must have lost her head, I suppose.
Anyway, it meant the end of my career in the diplomatic service.
All rather shameful.
Well, if the ladies can spare us...?
- To business.
- Indeed.
Yes.
I give you business.
You want our iron, Mr Lomax, MP?
Well, naturally.
I make one request.
Chimneys.
Give me Chimneys as a personal favour.
And, in return, I guarantee you can take home all the riches your heart desires.
- Well, I'm not sure...
- We are not for sale.
Not for sale.
Tell them.
Why don't you all try a hand of bridge?
- Oh, for God's sake.
- Yes.
It seems to be in order.
(Chimes)
You're quite sure?
Absolutely.
Very well.
Then mark your cross... ..here.
Now, Count, if you'd be kind enough to sign here.
With great pleasure.
(Rings bell) Mr Lomax!
Sir!
Jane!
What's happening?
I don't know.
What time is it?
If you'd all like to gather downstairs...
I'm sorry to have to wake you all up but one of Mr Lomax's security staff was found unconscious.
- Is that so?
That's right, sir.
Roberts.
- All present and correct, Eversleigh?
- Indeed so.
I believe we're one short.
- The Count.
- Out for the count.
That's no surprise, considering how he was knocking it back.
See if you can raise him.
- He's not in his room, sir.
- What?
Where is he?
Perhaps we need a search party.
Indeed.
Jaffers you and Roberts seal off the back door.
Bundle, the old servants' quarters.
You and Miss Blenkinsopp, the ground floor, and Virginia and I will look upstairs.
- Can't Virginia come with me?
- We don't have time for this.
Why do you always undermine me?
Will you two kindly desist?
Thank you.
Now, Virginia, can you run upstairs and collect his medicine?
Jane will remain here and keep an eye on him.
- Of course.
The rest of us can just as well look by ourselves.
Agreed?
I've brought your medicine.
Thank God for my darling girls.
Daddy?
(Bang)
George?
Not now!
- That sounded almost like...
- Was that a gunshot?
Someone close that door!
Well, where is he?
Any sign?
- Did you hear it?
- I think half the county heard it.
He can't have just vanished.
Are there no doorways, no outbuildings?
- You don't think...?
- Our little door.
Take that.
Should be torches on the wall.
Help yourself.
Come on, Jane.
- What is that?
Blood?
- Looks like it.
Anthony?
- I think he's been shot.
- What?
Want.
Want!
Count Ludwig?
Can you hear me?
- Is he breathing?
- Check his pulse.
Can you hear me?
- It wasn't me.
- I can't find a pulse.
- I think he's dead.
- It wasn't me!
Virginia!
Virginia!
Virginia!
(Bangs on door) Virginia!
He was such an enchanting man.
And he was our guest.
I'm sure there's a perfectly innocent explanation.
Virginia!
- I should go to him.
- Don't you dare.
Gin, come back.
- Virginia!
- Anthony.
- My love.
- Anthony!
- You can't go in, miss.
- May I at least speak to him?
- I'm sorry, miss.
- Oh, please.
Please.
Anthony, what are you even doing here?
Virginia...
You must promise me something.
Anything.
Please...promise me you'll forget me.
Anthony?
You're scaring me.
Anthony.
Finch.
Thank God.
Good to see you again.
Inspector Finch.
The guru of Scotland Yard.
Finch?
He looks quite like a cat, don't you think?
(Shouts) I loathe cats.
Ssh!
I gather he has devotees all over the Home Office.
They regard him as some sort of mystic.
A bit like Julian of Norwich, only with powers of arrest.
What do we know of the victim?
Born Vienna, 1892.
Wealthy parents.
Travelled about a good deal in his youth.
Something of a wandering spirit.
Entered politics soon after the war.
I can get my chap to find you a place in the town.
I shall be staying at Chimneys.
Murder rarely keeps office hours.
Hello.
Bit of fresh air.
Politically this could be a disaster, if not handled with care.
Indeed.
So the ladies retired early?
We had some business.
- Er...not relevant.
- He wanted to buy Chimneys.
He wanted to buy Chimneys?
Well, the proposal was that the government would purchase the house, and then pass it on to Count Ludwig as a gift.
- A bribe?
- Don't be absurd...
A personal bribe.
In return for which, he hands over a share of their heavy industry.
Where do we stand on that, morally?
Well back, I'd have thought.
Is there paperwork for this sale?
Signed, sealed and in my room in the top drawer.
All academic now, of course.
Understood.
As one door closes, another stands ajar, Lord Caterham.
(Scoffs)
Indeed.
So you gentlemen retired at...
About a quarter to eleven.
Until we were woken by the fire bell.
Mr Lomax!
Sir!
- At what time?
- Twenty to midnight.
We all met downstairs.
No sign of the Count.
So off we went, looking for him.
All save Clement and myself.
Next thing...
Boom!
(Bang)
The gunshot?
He was in the passageway all along.
Just a few yards away.
Any fingerprints on the weapon?
Regrettably not.
Still, we have the culprit.
Anthony Cade.
He has one or two questions to answer, certainly.
May I see the body?
I shall take you there at once.
Or perhaps Miss...
Marple.
Marple.
Yes.
If it's no inconvenience?
Oh.
Well, no, not at all.
What was he doing here, almost an hour after he went to bed?
He showed an interest over dinner in the Van Dyck portrait.
I suppose the Count could have returned...
- A private viewing?
- I suppose.
And chanced upon the secret door.
Except that nothing quite happens by chance, does it?
Not really.
Or is that my tidy-minded preference?
I see you don't have a man with you.
I'm sorry?
Well, inspectors nowadays tend to have a man with them.
Perhaps you prefer to muse alone?
Perhaps no man would have me.
Oh.
This blood...
He was shot here.
And crawled, staggered, or was dragged this-a-way... ..where he was found in the arms of Mr Cade.
Here.
Before falling on poor Virginia.
Here.
All fairly straightforward, apparently.
Ah-ha.
Is it a letter?
Not quite.
A treble clef.
A virtuoso.
Perhaps you could take this and study it for me, Miss Marple.
Very well.
The Count said something before he died.
Want, want...
Want?
Are you sure?
Mm-hm.
Meaning?
Well, I suppose we all want something, even at death's door.
Kiss of life, perhaps?
How did you get here?
I climbed over the wall.
I was eager to get up to the house and this gentleman was blocking the path.
Would you mind, sir?
As I remember,
I came from around here.
Then I spotted the gentleman, I panicked, and then...
You hit him.
Yes, I am sorry about that.
Using this?
Exactly.
- What time was that?
- 11:33.
Precisely.
I remember because I looked at my watch.
I envy your eyesight, Mr Cade.
You see, that's the thing.
I know, because there was a light on in one of the upstairs rooms.
It was first storey and then second to the right.
Now, I can remember because someone had lit a fire.
Rather a warm night for a fire.
Well, there was definitely smoke coming out of the chimney above.
Anyway, at this stage common sense sounded the retreat.
Did you heed the warning?
Sadly, common sense and I are no longer on speaking terms so I carried on along here and through the door.
And then I came down here, opened the trap door
and then I heard the gunshot.
(Bang)
(Count groans) Good God!
- He'd been shot already?
- Yes.
- Any idea who shot him?
- Afraid not.
And yet, the revolver three feet from you, the victim at your heels?
I swear I never saw any revolver.
Mr Cade, may one ask what you were actually doing here?
Yes, well, I did wonder when you'd get around to asking that.
The truth is, I couldn't let Lomax have his way without putting up a fight.
- His way with Virginia?
- Yes.
I thought to myself: just sit tight and then burst in at breakfast and give you all a fright.
You certainly did that.
The constable found this in your pocket.
Oh.
Any idea who wrote it?
"Dear Cade, come to Chimneys.
There's a trapdoor in the garden.
11:45 sharp."
What?
I didn't write this.
Are you sure?
Mr Cade seems to think...
Not my style.
A love note is not something you just dash off.
I don't see what you're sniggering at.
I'm sorry - idiot - may I see?
Hand it over.
It appears from the postmark to have been sent locally, express service, as late as yesterday morning.
So, none of you sent this letter?
How's this for a hypothesis?
Cade types the letter himself, takes the train down to the village and posts it.
All in a cynical bid to ensnare Virginia.
Rubbish!
I was having tea with him yesterday morning.
At the Lyons Corner House on the Edgware Road.
And it was very nice.
Mr Lomax, your room is second from the end, isn't it?
So?
There was a light on there last night.
Just before the alarm sounded.
Rubbish!
Says who?
Oh.
Cade.
Blatant attempt to put you off your game, Inspector.
Anthony.
I told you.
I'm not worth the sacrifice.
I'll be the judge of that, thank you very much.
If you would be so good as to remain at Chimneys until further notice.
What about him?
You're not going to let him wander about?
We'll keep an eye on him.
Keep an eye on all of you.
(Hums low note)
(Soprano notes)
It's quite perverse, isn't it?
(Range of notes)
He was such a musical fellow.
Quite the dancer.
(Shrill note)
I always say the point of a tune is to boost the morale, surely?
Indeed.
- May I help?
- Ah, Treadwell, the very man.
Where is that musical handbook of Virginia's?
You know the one?
Hits Of The Blitz?
The very nelly.
Come.
(Hums and strikes notes)
No...
Oh.
Hard at it, Miss Marple?
Inspector, it's...
I'm a little lost.
One can hardly see where one bar ends and the next begins.
(Hits notes)
(He hums)
I'm sorry, forgive me.
It's...
Hardly music at all.
Could it be...
I almost wonder...
Forgive me.
Go on.
Well, I wonder, is it possible, it is, in fact, a message of some sort in code?
(Voices outside)
What were you thinking of?
You know nothing about the man or his people.
I know he's funny and reckless and his mother has a jolly nice bicycle, which I happen to think counts for more than a dozen columns in Who's Who.
- He ran a bar.
- Oh, how philanthropic.
In Africa.
In Bulawayo.
He had a friend with him, they were business partners.
And does this friend have a name?
Jimmy McGrath.
They did rather well, for a time, but Jimmy liked to drink, you see.
He gambled it all away.
Lost it in one sitting to a gentleman from Pretoria.
You've known him for less than a fortnight.
- Daddy.
- Ah, Caterham.
Knock some sense into your daughter.
Oh, well it's a brave man who'd dare to.
What would your mother have said?
My mother, you presume to speak about, always went with her heart.
Isn't that so?
And she raised me to do the same.
- Virginia!
- Anthony is no murderer.
(Recites numbers) What's she doing?
Trying to prove her lover innocent.
How does she propose to do that?
I have no idea.
Like it or not, Mr Cade was still there, in the tunnel, with the smoking gun.
- Will you arrest him?
- I'm tempted.
He's careless, all the lies he tells.
The letter, that business with the light on in the house...
A man like Cade requires plenty of rope.
Like most of us.
Even you.
Am I under suspicion?
I know your secret, Miss Marple.
You are a puzzle-outer of mysteries.
I muddle through one or two.
It's a matter of association.
I envy you, you know, the amateur sleuth.
One has nothing to lose, somehow.
Still, a salary is er...convenient.
Indeed.
If it wasn't for the generosity of my nephew...
Raymond.
So I've read in a dozen case files.
Yes.
Hardly a distinguished name.
- Raymond?
- No.
Chimneys.
Until it stands before one, and then it all makes sense.
Dozens of them.
Splendid.
That great tower standing proud, so that...
Which was the window Mr Cade said was lit up on the night of the murder?
Second from the right?
The MP's room.
And yet, as one approaches the spot where Mr Cade stood, a window is obscured.
Do you see?
On account of the tower.
So that what appears to be second from the right is, in fact...
Third from the right.
So who was up and about moments before the gunshot?
At 33 minutes past 11 your bedroom light was on, 12 minutes before the gunshot.
Yes.
Briefly.
Can you tell me why?
I wished to speak to Count Ludwig, but noticing his bed was unoccupied, I returned to my room.
Any particular reason for wishing to speak to him?
Oh, he'd... earlier in the evening he'd asked for an extra blanket.
So perhaps you lit a fire?
I beg your pardon?
At the same time. 11:33.
No fires last night.
I...
I would have known, you see.
You know, it's funny, but yesterday I really felt that you knew him.
This looks a very grand affair.
That's how they did it in those days.
And this would be the orchestra, at the back here?
What sort of music did they play?
Waltzes, mainly.
Viennese waltzes?
It's him, isn't it?
There.
Count Ludwig.
So he has been here before.
And where else but in the orchestra?
What brought you back after all these years?
Any thoughts, Miss Treadwell?
He got no more than he deserved.
I'm sorry?
The girl who...
Who disappeared?
Agnes.
The parlour maid, yes.
Whatever happened to Agnes?
That night after the party, I...
I saw a light...
This was the tomb I saw opened.
Her body, it was down there.
Let me help you.
Clement, are you sure?
Agnes.
Her apron.
Poor child.
All this time, we said she was the thief.
I think it's time you told us what happened.
The mistress, she confided in me once.
Madeleine?
What did she tell you?
She said Agnes was with him that night.
With whom?
A musician.
A fiddle player.
Oh, the Count?
All these years.
Not a word.
I wanted to, sir.
But I thought if I spoke out, you would contact the police, and there would be more of a scandal.
It had already ruined your career and if a stolen jewel could cast such a shadow, and then the theft of a life...
I'm so sorry.
Oh, what have I done?
I'm so sorry.
- Well?
- She's certainly hiding something.
Damn.
Oh.
- Wondered if there was any...
- What?
Cardboard.
Wondered if there was any...
What are you...?
- What do you want cardboard for?
- I'm making something.
Well, I can't see any, so if you wouldn't mind.
What are you up to, Miss Blenkinsopp?
Just looking for some privacy in this big, old nasty...house.
Hands off.
Sorry.
I'll leave you to it.
(Sings notes)
Oh, it's child's play.
It's musical mathematics.
Don't you see?
One simply transposes the music from notes into letters.
So two octaves... take us from A up to O, while these 11 sharps bring us all the way up to Z.
Your coded letter.
# La!
La-la!
Please, I cannot abide flattery.
Thank you, Lady Revel.
Thank you.
- Very well.
- Thank you, Bundle.
"For this reason, my beloved Captain...
I can never see you again.
Promise me you will return one day for the greatest jewel.
Richmond Twenty, North Three East."
A love letter in the dead man's pocket.
Incomplete.
If we had a couple more pages...
A date'd be helpful.
Though the manuscript was written in ballpoint pen.
Indeed.
So, the last couple of years.
Yes.
A farewell?
"Beloved Captain." Captain?
An alias for Count Ludwig, if this affair was to be kept quiet?
The Count had a secret lover.
Agnes?
Perhaps.
But what do we make of this?
"Promise me you will return one day for the greatest jewel."
Is it possible...?
Count Ludwig came here to Chimneys not to discuss iron, but on a secret mission, revealed within this letter, to recover the stolen Mysore Diamond located somewhere in this house.
No wonder it's in code.
That's why he wanted to buy Chimneys.
"Richmond Twenty, North Three East."
The evidence was before our eyes.
The Van Dyck?
And the subject?
The Duke of Richmond.
18, 19, 20.
So?
So.
Don't torment me, Inspector.
If you're holding something back...
Want, want...
His last words.
Unless, of course...
Vunt, vunt...
Unless of course he was speaking not English, but his mother tongue.
Not "want, want" but "vunt, vunt".
"Der Wand" in High German.
Or "vunt" in the Austrian dialect.
Meaning?
The wall, the wall.
You think...?
You think the diamond is hidden somewhere in the wall?
Well.
Bravo.
But, you know, I think I know a gentleman who might shed a little more light on the matter.
You were accompanying your godmother?
Lady...
Lady Somerset.
That's right.
We all used to call her Robbie.
Must have been quite bewitching.
What?
The diamond.
Oh.
I see.
Well, it's all just coloured glass to me, Inspector.
What have you got there?
Notes from the investigation in '32.
Interviews with, among others, yourself.
"I have no recollection of said diamond's disappearance.
In fact, I was asleep."
I'd been charging about since dawn.
Really, Inspector...
I see Lady Somerset retired early as well.
We had nothing to do with any theft, I assure you.
The point is...
See for yourself.
I was a young rake.
She was easily led.
I see.
Well, at least, I have an inkling.
And he was writing under a nom de plume.
Count Ludwig had an alias?
Mm-hm.
The Captain.
Odd.
And a secret lover, to boot.
It's all in the letter.
Who was she, the lover?
We wondered.
Agnes?
Poor Agnes.
Not only that.
The Count seems to have had a hand in the theft of the famous diamond.
So he bumped her off, did he?
Two thieves fighting over the spoils?
Well, do start away, everyone.
Yes, and she wasn't the only one, was she?
The only victim, I mean.
Bill, where is the...?
Right here, my dearest.
Chimneys.
It's not quite to scale, I'm afraid.
The night of the murder.
We all came downstairs.
Yes?
And we couldn't find the Count, so off we all went.
Separately.
Now, this is the point.
This is where we all were.
So, Bundle, you were upstairs in the guest wing.
George was there also.
Treadwell, kitchen.
Miss Blenkinsopp, I believe, was on the terrace.
Bill - study and I was upstairs then down to the council chamber.
Then... (Hits table) Gunshot!
Back we all flew, front door wide open.
Someone close that door!
Agreed?
Who's to say one of us couldn't have run out of the house through the garden, trapdoor, into the passage, shot the Count and then one minute to get back, after the gunshot, in time to make it look like... well, to make it look like we'd been in the house all along?
Front door to the trapdoor is...
How many strides, Bill?
We measured it. 112?
112.
Five minutes there and back.
It's possible.
You said so yourself, didn't you, Bill?
Sure.
But why would anybody...?
The Count wanted Chimneys, didn't he?
And, Bundle, you're so mortally opposed to losing the house.
I had no idea I was so pathetically grasping.
Well, somebody killed him.
And as for that poor dead girl...
My little fox.
What you need is fattening up.
Enough.
Quite.
You making notes, Blenkinsopp?
No.
To think, what a pleasing oral history this will all make back in your municipal headquarters.
Not at all.
When everyone knows you've had your claws in Chimneys for years, grubbing about with your letters and your polite notices, rifling through our drawers, tipping off our creditors.
Mother was on her death bed, not that you lost a moment's sleep over that.
- God knows why.
- I'll tell you why.
I caught her in the study, going through the old housekeeping records, weren't you?
1932.
This is all about Agnes, isn't it?
You knew her?
Agnes Parker was a child, a child when she was handed over to people like you.
Trusted to your care.
And when one morning she wasn't there, it broke her family's heart.
And not one of you had the decency to ask why.
I feel sick.
Well, you might.
No, I feel sick.
(Groans)
- Daddy?
- Clement?
It's his ticker.
Where's your tonic?
Your tonic!
Excuse me.
There's hardly any left.
Just take a swig.
- Excuse me.
- Damn soup.
Let's get some fresh air.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so terribly sorry.
What kind of soup is this, Miss Treadwell?
Mushroom and sage.
But you are quite well.
Oh, I have no appetite by nightfall.
One of the hidden costs of old age.
Miss Treadwell, help me here.
Are you quite sure in your mind that the Count murdered poor Agnes?
If there's anything else, then, please...?
It's been so many years.
- Can this not wait until the morning?
- No.
Fuse wire.
What's that doing there?
Indeed.
Dear me, what a business.
Ah, yes.
Foxglove leaves.
Easily muddled with sage.
Must have found their way into the soup.
- Foxglove, you see, contains...
- Digitalis.
Natural poison.
I'll be indoors.
(Toilet flushes)
Sorry.
(Knocks)
Jane.
Here to rebuke me?
Castigate away.
No.
Your sister's account of last night.
Please don't mind Ginny.
Her nerves are shot.
I noticed that you were upstairs, here in the guest wing, during the search party, and I wondered what became of them.
Of...?
The legal paperwork, drawn up last night for the sale of Chimneys, which you took from Mr Lomax's room.
(Bang)
Oh, that.
Old maid's last refuge, isn't it?
An overweening love of domestic animals.
Not that they ever reciprocated.
It was always Treadwell.
Every dog and pup we ever had.
She used to give them the funniest names.
(Whines)
There's really no need to stay, sir.
No, I'm fine.
She had a weak heart?
Well, not that I knew.
I wondered merely why the poison in the foxglove leaves should prove lethal for her while the rest of us...
Well... she was a terrible worrier.
Shanghai. '27.
She travelled about with us everywhere.
And this one?
Oh...
Do you know, I have no idea.
Our friend the Captain.
All of them?
Looks like it.
And not in musical code.
Not this one.
Who was he writing to?
Constance?
She was with us for so many years.
One forgot she even had a Christian name.
Constance Treadwell.
I was so sure she was holding something from us.
Constance was Count Ludwig's lover?
COUNT LUDWIG:
My dearest Constance.
Nine days until the party at the Palazzo Ducale.
It feels like a prison sentence...
It has rained every day since Caracas.
The Captain.
I am mad, Bedlamised, with love.
But the lamb is stamping her little hooves.
I must sign off now.
Be of courage.
Until Friday and Chimneys.
All my love.
...Our glorious reunion.
I will take you in my arms.
And we will make such light-fingered music."
Treadwell?
I suppose she had much to lose.
Her position, her livelihood.
And when love is driven underground, it quickens its ardour.
Oh, we had a case with our organist and a young page turner at St Mary Mead.
I see.
Well, one mustn't talk scandal.
Places and times.
Venice, Caracas.
He must have trailed her for two years at least.
All the way to Chimneys.
Back to the party.
But Treadwell, a diamond thief?
Well, perhaps it was the Captain who urged her to do it?
What is the "lamb" in these letters?
- That's...
- Well, I think...
I'm so sorry.
You first.
Agnes.
Old papist word for lamb.
Agnes Dei.
Lamb of God.
Altar boy.
Misspent youth.
So, safe to conclude Agnes Parker was the courier, ferrying letters between Constance Treadwell and her "Captain".
And then, on the night of the party in '32, the theft of the Mysore Diamond...
Agnes is murdered.
Wildly circumstantial, but the messenger, murdered by Count Ludwig because she found out about the theft?
She knew too much, the Count buries her in the crypt, and, of course, everyone assumes that Agnes has stolen the diamond.
And then, years later, the two lovers dead themselves.
Or murdered.
That wretched soup.
Which begs the question...
How can the same dish kill one of us while provoking mere unpleasantness in the rest?
The foxgloves tossed into the soup by the killer to convince us that Miss Treadwell's death was an accident.
But, in fact, she was poisoned by something else.
But what?
- I have no idea.
- Pity.
And who among us, I wonder, has been quickest to defend poor Agnes Parker?
Yes.
I was at school with her.
They lived on our street.
This whole business with Agnes, well...
It's how they treat them, isn't it?
You never believed Agnes stole the Mysore Diamond in '32, did you?
Of course not.
But I didn't knock anyone off.
And I certainly don't know anything about any poison.
Digi... digi...
And yet here you are...on the terrace.
Count Ludwig!
Quite alone.
No witnesses.
What do we think?
Could it be that Miss Blenkinsopp climbed into the passage, fired the gunshot... ..then back in the house?
I don't think so.
Not with my asthma.
And yet, you saw something, didn't you?
Yes.
I realise now it must have been Cade I saw in the garden.
It did seem odd behaviour for a security guard.
I could have said something, cried for help.
I could have stopped it, but I just stood there.
You're absolutely right, Inspector.
I fear Mr Cade is running out of rope.
Mr Eversleigh.
Here we are.
"Dear Cade.
Come to Chimneys.
There's a trapdoor in the garden.
11:45 sharp."
Patent falsehood.
Yes, well.
Note the capital C?
The letter has a little crack in it.
Do you see?
And again here, the same little crack.
So?
The note to Mr Cade appears to have been written on this very typewriter.
Which you yourself were using on the very morning the letter was dispatched.
Oh, I see.
You wrote this, didn't you?
Yes.
Well, some of it, anyway.
But I don't remember anything about 11:45.
But your purpose in writing the letter?
To help Mr Cade gain access to Chimneys?
How long have you been acquainted with Mr Cade?
Couple of weeks.
I lost rather heavily at cards.
My pet vice, losing heavily at cards.
I get so crashingly bored in the office.
There's a little room run in Aldwych, pontoon, poker for the die-hards.
How much did you lose?
97 quid.
Anyway, in walked Cade.
Said he could cover the debt.
He said we could help each other out.
Go on.
So, this gentleman from Pretoria who's holding your friend?
He has a pet passion.
Diamonds?
Yes.
The Mysore Diamond?
He gave me six weeks to bring him the real McCoy or Jimmy's life would be forfeit.
So you staged the street assault to endear yourself to Virginia?
Yes.
Posing as the good Samaritan to creep into the affections of an innocent young woman.
George, please, my head is splitting.
And the assailant?
Agh!
Sorry.
But your real purpose was to gain access to Chimneys, where the diamond was first hidden.
I am a decent man.
Pah.
A decent man who did a stupid thing.
I had no choice.
Ditto.
Absolutely.
Anthony Cade, I am arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Count Ludwig Von Stainach.
Get out!
I love you.
And you.
Really?
Nobody say anything, please.
Just for a moment.
I think, despite everything, that this must be my favourite room in the world.
It was out of bounds as a boy, so naturally it was where one longed to be.
And this heraldic brute.
Oh, the battles we fought, through shot and shell.
Armies, dragons, the whole works.
Then one summer, 12 years old, just tall enough to open his visor, my brother in arms was nothing at all.
Just empty air.
If this is you gently breaking the news that Anthony Cade is no knight in shining armour, consider me rudely awoken.
No, no.
I'm saying that love is its own adventure.
Take no-one for granted, not even those closest to home.
- Jane, help me.
- No, no.
I know what you're saying.
Wish me luck.
Excuse me, George.
Sorry to barge in on matters of state.
I accept.
- I beg your pardon?
- The offer.
If it's still open.
I know how sticky you are about ultimata.
But...
Cade?
Oh.
That was a dream I had.
I'm awake now.
Well, I'm delighted to hear it.
Well, well.
The first of many.
A drink.
Champagne.
A toast!
What are you doing?
(Blows horn)
Get off him!
You stay there.
Virginia!
Virginia!
A toast.
To us.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
(Thud)
What on earth was that?
It came from inside the house.
In the passageway.
Sir, Cade's escaped.
Try the trapdoor.
It's stuck.
Virginia!
Virginia!
Mr Cade, all this isn't going to look very bright in court.
Virginia!
I want you to know.
I want to give you something - the diamond.
Not that I give a damn.
You're the only prize worth dying for.
And it's got to be here somewhere.
And when I find it, it's yours.
Do you hear?
Anthony!
Got it!
It's him.
Get off me.
He couldn't even get that right.
What's he trying to prove?
Well, he has proven one thing.
- Oh?
- His innocence.
May I show you?
(Muffled thuds)
We were all standing just where we were the moment of the fatal gunshot.
Agreed?
- Indeed.
- Everything just as it was?
No.
The gunshot, it was too quiet.
Yes, it was much quieter, Inspector.
Like Mr Cade's hammering a few moments ago, whereas the sound we thought was the gunshot made my ears ring.
Mr Cade, you remember, out in the garden, what did he see on that warm night?
Someone had lit a fire.
And then that off-cut of flex that had no business being in the compost.
A piece of fuse, Inspector.
The Count's killer lit something in the chimney that evening.
On a slow fuse, timed to explode 15 minutes later, to deceive us all that what we heard was a gunshot when what we, in fact, heard was a firework.
What was it you said, Inspector?
"Like it or not, Anthony Cade was found in that tunnel with the smoking gun."
But what if the gun was not smoking?
What if the Count was killed earlier than supposed, after the men retired from their business at quarter to eleven but before the alarm bell almost an hour later?
Suddenly, the killer could be any one of us.
Are you sure?
You recall the Count's interest, over dinner, in The Duke Of Richmond?
No great feat to quietly invite the Count back after the rest of us were in bed, show him the hidden bolt, tempt him inside, then shoot him, and toss the gun to be found later as if abandoned by the killer.
Sadly for the Count, he didn't die straightaway.
The murderer's only mistake, if mistake it was.
Good God!
The poor man was still living when Mr Cade found him some time later.
Go on, Jane.
Those letters...
I've been woefully, unforgivably naive.
Constance and the Captain - ah, the romance of it.
One gets swept along and yet...
Let me pose a question.
A pair of lovers, determined to hide their secret, might they not write under an alias?
Indeed, Count Ludwig called himself the Captain.
So he did.
But why just the Count and not Constance?
Did she not fear exposure as much as him?
Unless Constance was also an alias.
So the Constance of the letters was not Treadwell?
Forgive me, Bundle.
I took this from your scrapbook.
It's a dog.
So what?
Well, it's Mama's first mutt.
Captain.
It was called Captain.
It was so besotted with Treadwell Mama used to joke they were like...
"Perfect lovers."
Our mother must have thought of these aliases.
Constance and her Captain.
Our mother...
Took the alias "Constance".
Your mother was the Count's secret lover.
I don't understand.
Are you saying that the Count and Madeleine stole the diamond?
Oh, that wretched diamond.
We're all so bewitched by the Mysore Diamond, we forge our theories and forget the facts.
It is so important to see things clearly, as if through a pane of glass, and not a prism.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Good God.
May I?
I'm afraid there's no way the Count murdered Agnes and made off with the diamond.
Because the diamond has been with Agnes all the time.
In the tomb, just where the killer left it.
When we found poor Agnes's bones, do you remember?
Your histrionics in the crypt.
You took it then, didn't you?
Then dropped it in the fountain.
Why else would you be drying your hands?
Daddy?
Why?
The night of the party.
'32.
I'd lost a cufflink, if you can believe it.
I went upstairs and then... (Waltz)
No, no, you mustn't go in there, please.
Please, sir, listen to what I'm saying.
I'd not meant to kill her, but she tried to prevent me from seeing my wife and the fiddle player.
And then my mind cleared.
I took the diamond.
Left it with Agnes.
Naturally it was assumed that she had run off with it.
Then all that remained was to tell my wife a white lie.
You told her Agnes had been seen.
Cavorting with the Viennese fiddler who, of course, went on writing to her for quite some time, but I took care of those letters.
They would only have caused her pain.
It's funny, looking back.
She was so easily deceived.
These romances are so fragile.
There's no real devotion at all.
Not such as we all had together, as a family, here at Chimneys.
She was unhappy.
Trapped.
No wonder she got ill.
But after she died, you found the earlier letters, didn't you, from the Captain?
She'd kept them safe, all these years.
Yes, indeed.
Every word.
So that when Mr Lomax showed you the letter from Count Ludwig, suggesting a visit to Chimneys you knew the handwriting at once.
A precise match for the old love letters.
And you knew...
The Captain was on his way.
But why the firework?
Why 11:45?
Mr Eversleigh, is it possible that the letter you wrote to Mr Cade was in fact left unsealed?
Your guest has arrived, sir.
Still on the desk?
Letters for posting on his Lordship's desk.
All that remained was to add the time.
You wrote and posted the letter to Cade yourself.
And staged the gunshot for 11:45 to incriminate Cade.
What better way to be rid of your enemies?
Frame one for the killing of the other.
Cade is no good.
You said as much yourself.
And as for this plan to ship you off to Africa...
Now, don't look at me like that.
You cannot build a marriage on lies.
Aren't you supposed to build it on love?
And Treadwell?
As we thought.
Poisoned not by the foxglove leaves... ..but by your tonic.
Active ingredient: digitalis.
A huge overdose.
I do regret that.
She was a faithful servant.
More faithful than you knew.
You were so fearful that she would tell the Inspector about the affair.
On the contrary.
She was taking measures to protect her mistress's secret.
As soon as Agnes's bones were recovered, she took the letters from amongst your possessions to her own room.
If I'd let her live, no-one would have found out.
Is that what you mean?
Well, that's it, then.
Not quite.
Daddy?
"Return one day for the greatest jewel."
Stop.
What if this jewel was a diamond of a different kind?
Stop!
Whatever it is, we have a right to know.
A rose.
Not just any rose.
The Richmond rose.
"Richmond Twenty, North Three East."
The Richmond referred to is not the portrait.
Precisely.
The rose of Richmond.
Ah.
Well, these directions, where did they lead?
(Counts to herself)
One, two...
I don't understand.
Jane?
The Count's last words.
Do you remember?
Der Wand.
The wall.
We thought he meant the wall in the passageway.
But this Virginia creeper, when was it planted?
Madeleine planted it 23 years ago to celebrate your birth.
Virginia creeper.
He knew, I'm sure he did, as he lay dying.
The rose, the dance... ..it all made sense.
I think your mother wrote to the Count, shortly before she passed away.
The coded letter?
She didn't want the truth to die with her, not quite.
- So, you mean...
- You were the "greatest jewel".
He'd come to take you away.
My own little girl.
My darling girl.
He was my father?
No.
No.
I feel, if you were to let go now...
I won't.
I'd just float off and...
I won't.
Come on.
No use putting off the inevitable.
Are you going to tell her or shall I?
Oh, I think it's best coming from me.
Blenkinsopp!
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
Bundle won't like that at all.
But you're not selling Chimneys?
Well, Bundle couldn't bear to stay on, and I don't want to live here, so what do you think?
Pass the whole headache on to Blenkinsopp and her tea and scones.
Why not?
Will she be all right?
Bundle, I mean.
Oh, she'll foist herself onto some undeserving cause.
Her father?
I suppose.
And you?
Here they come.
A happy marriage.
It can't be that difficult, can it?
Go with your heart.
Like mother?
I keep thinking, if she loved her Count so much, why was she so quick to believe he'd run off?
I suppose love is an act of courage.
Yes.
Miss Marple.
Goodbye, Inspector.
Thank you.
I see now I've grown too fond of my own reputation.
I was so bewitched by the blasted diamond.
And now look at me.
The latest of your casualties.
What do you think?
Interpol want me to take it to South Africa, entrap this villainous fellow from Pretoria.
You know, Inspector, I don't care for it at all.
Goodbye.
ON MY LAND, WHAT I HAVE WILL HELP ME LIVE MY LIFE.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed, be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us this day, our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
Amen
Now.
Tonight we'll read John, Chapter 10, verses 1-16. "The good Shepherd. "
You'll find it in the hand out that I prepared for you.
- Do you want to read first Giovanni?
- Okay.
"I tell you the truth, the man who does not enter the sheep pen"
"by the gate, but climbs in by some other way,"
"is a thief and a robber.
But he who enters through the gate of the sheep pen"
"is the shepherd. "
- Elia!
Just a minute.
- Good evening.
- Hi.
Would you like to stay with us and read tonight's Bible passages?
No, Mum, pray for me as well.
- Bye!
- Bye.
I'm sorry about that, do please continue, Giovanni.
"The watchman opened the gate and the sheep listened to his voice. "
"And he called his own sheep by name and led them out. "
PIER VITTORIO TONDELLI "THE OTHER LIBERTINES"
Did you sleep?
I didn't, it was so hot last night.
Here!
- Hi, Nana!
- Hi, Elia!
Come over here a minute!
Give your nana a kiss.
You're so skinny, you need to eat more.
- Yes, Nana, I do eat.
- Did you sleep well last night?
- No, badly.
- I couldn't sleep either!
- I've got to go now.
Bye, Nana.
- Bye bye.
Come back and see me soon!
Maria, do you remember Emilia?
Elia!
She looks so pretty!
- Yes!
- She has always been pretty, but now...
Come quickly!
Come over here!
Gosh, I've known you since you were this high.
I wanted to introduce you to my son Elia.
This is...
Emilia, the girl we've been waiting for.
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.
This is Vittorio and Caterina's granddaughter.
Don't you remember her?
What are you doing these days?
Studying?
Or working?
I'm writing my thesis for my degree.
Be careful, there's stuff on the floor!
Sorry it's always in a mess round here.
I'm used to mess, don't worry.
Elia.
- Can I put my bag down here?
- Yes.
That's fine.
Here.
You can use these gloves if you don't want to dirty your hands.
- No.
I'll just come as I am.
- Okay.
If you change your mind, they're there in the first drawer.
You don't need much else.
- Have you already harvested grapes?
- Once...
- No, twice, with some people I knew.
- Perfect.
But they're dead now.
- I'm sorry about that.
- I'm not.
They never paid me.
Were they... young?
Why do you care?
I'm just curious.
I don't know.
I think they were...
Let's just say that it was the right time.
- Better that way.
- Well, I don't know, better no!
Another thing...
Be careful not to crush the bunches when you put them in the basket
With this heat they'd start fermenting straight away.
It must be beautiful living in the country.
I've always wanted to.
It's all so... dirty!
The wonderful smell of the country air...
- Do you like it?
- Yes, I was born here.
But it's not exactly perfumed around here.
There's a stable there.
Yes, Well, I meant...
- What's that?
- What?
- How do I look?
- Good.
Really?
- I don't seem a bit mad to you?
- No, it looks good on you.
Keep it, it's a present.
- Really?
- Yes.
Thank you.
I wasn't sleeping.
Sorry, I didn't want to wake you.
No problem, you're not.
- Are you hungry?
- No.
Because my Mum has made some food for you.
- I don't want to eat today.
Thanks.
- Okay.
But, if you had a cigarette...
A cigarette?
Yes, a fag, tobacco, a smoke, how would you like me to say it?
Death!
It's just I'm not meant to smoke.
Yes.
Just like you're not meant to have a wank before going to bed.
I've got some in my room.
Shall I go and get them for you?
Maria!
Food's ready!
Damn!
You've got this far already, good?
Wait a minute, let me help you.
Come down slowly.
Yes that's right.
Slowly.
There we are.
Elia!
Be careful!
Lucky you're not my dealer!
Sorry, I finished them yesterday evening.
Don't worry, I've got some myself.
Would your old man mind if I smoke here?
Yes, I think so.
Have you got a lighter at least?
Not here.
Here!
Thanks.
Do you want one?
- My parents don't know that I smoke.
- Oh, really?
Thanks, Elia, for the drag!
Good evening, William!
Did you hear that accent?
Don't tell your mum about this!
Listen, you can go.
We'll finish off here now.
- Really?
- Yes, we've nearly finished.
Okay.
Great, so see you all tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Good evening.
Bye!
Bye!
- Good evening, Maria.
- Good evening.
- Come on, I need that ladder!
- Okay.
Just a minute.
Good night, Nana!
- Have you already finished?
- Yes, I'm not hungry anymore.
But there's another course.
Do you want some cheese?
No, no.
Night!
This was my father's car.
But I know how to drive it!
Italian music?
Do you listen to it?
What do you listen to?
I...
Yes, I...
I used to listen to the usual songwriters:
De Gregori, De André, Guccini...
De Gregori, Guccini, De André...
The usual.
Also Battisti.
At school parties, when I was younger, when I was in middle school.
And writers...
Tondelli, I'm reading at the moment.
Tondelli I'm reading at the moment, he's on my bedside table.
I've got the book on my bedside table.
I've read Palandri.
And you?
Thanks for yesterday!
Children always think their parents don't know anything, but that's bullshit!
How long have you been smoking?
I think it was after the end of middle school.
It was my boyfriend who got me started.
And I just never stopped.
Well, it wasn't really that he let me try it, he forced me to try it.
Nice guy!
- What?
- No, nothing, nothing!
Well he was cool then.
- I don't think I can reach these ones!
- Leave it.
I can do that later.
So, you've been doing that since middle school?
I mean, your first boyfriend, you had in middle school?
No, I already had one before that, in primary school.
But it was nothing serious.
- What year are you in?
- I'm about to start upper sixth.
- Have you already fucked?
- What?
No obviously not!
Why do you say that?
Because you look like someone who likes to wank.
Or maybe you're a catholic?
I'm not a Catholic!
So, on the other hand, you had sex at 10 years old?
No.
At your age more or less.
With the guy that made me smoke!
Do you have a girlfriend, Elia?
No, I don't have one.
Is that obvious to you as well?
You'll have one.
You're a good looking guy.
Are you tired?
A little bit, yes.
Ah, it's a good life here.
You are strange you townies.
You love the country, but... you never stay for long!
- You're right.
So bourgeois!
And that?
That was our father's car.
It was Samuele's first car.
In a year it'll be mine.
- Do you want to get in it?
- Yes.
- Have you ever been to Paris?
- No, never.
- Have you?
- Yes, last year, for the first time.
With my boyfriend.
- Would you go back?
- I would love to live there!
After my degree, just to try you know.
My friend works in a bar.
She says they're always looking for people.
I just need a change.
And your boyfriend?
If he wants to, he can come to,
Otherwise he'll have to wait for me to come back.
Bugger!
Now I have to go and clean up my room!
My mother is such a dickhead!
Doesn't she realise she'll never turn it in to a church!
Really, is she that catholic?
My name is Elia, and my brother is Samuele.
What do you think?
- And your dad?
- Well...
If it was left to him we'd probably have been called Palmiro and Enrico.
Maybe it's best that it wasn't up to him if I ended up getting Palmiro.
Definitely...
- And where's Samuele now?
- He is studying in Bologna.
I say studying, he's nearly 30 so...
He's always travelling around Europe, he sends us postcards every now and then.
Think he writes for a music magazine.
We haven't seen him since last Christmas.
He doesn't do shit!
- What are you up to this evening?
- Nothing.
Would you be up for drinking a beer?
I don't feel like studying?
Okay.
See you later!
Hi.
Hi.
- Which way is it?
- Which direction?
- I only managed to steal this one.
- Thanks.
- Is this where you bring your girlies?
- No!
- I've only brought one girl here, once.
- Ah, you see!
How did it go?
- Did you kiss her?
- No!
No.
Of course not!
- I didn't manage to get that far.
- I can't believe it!
This is the perfect place for seduction.
Yes, but she was shy, and she already had a boyfriend.
Who cares about that?
- She came here with you, didn't she?
- Yes I know, I know.
Do you still like her?
Yes.
Well, I don't know!
Oh, you guys, you're always so undecided!
Do you think about her?
- Every now and then, yes!
- Then you like her.
- Where is she now?
- In Cesenatico, at the seaside.
When she comes back, tell her that you thought about her.
- She has a boyfriend!
- Who cares!
It's actually better that way, she'll already be tired of him.
How do you know?
Elia...
- The cigarette.
- What?
- I don't have a lighter.
- What a surprise!
In my pocket.
Should I get it?
It's not there.
In the other one.
- It's not there either.
- Isn't it?
Sorry.
And now?
What will we do without Enrico?
With Craxi there, what a dodgy guy he is!
I don't know.
There must be some other honest men in that group?
No.
Not really!
- Comrade!
- So, how's it going?
Go on, William, go and get some wine.
It's worth it?
Hey, chuck!
Hi.
This is Emilia, do you remember her?
- Is that you?
What are you doing here?
- I need some money!
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi.
How long has it been since we last saw you?
I think it was Christmas.
No, it can't be, that's far too long!
You made me jump when you screamed.
Don't be so silly!
- No, thank you.
- Come on, just have a drop.
Let's raise our glasses to Samuele.
Yes, for not having been lost forever.
Wow, it's incredible that all my stuff is still here.
My records, the posters...
You can tell which is my half of the room and which is yours.
Can you lend me a pair of pants and I'll give them back to you?
- In the drawer.
- The first one?
And what do we have here?
Cesenatico...
You've never been there.
- Is it a girl?
- Leave me alone.
Listen...
Here you can have these.
If they fit you, you can keep them.
White ones?
They were probably mine once upon a time anyway.
God, they must be at least 10 years old.
Even the mess is the same.
What are you reading?
Ah, Tondelli!
Wow!
- Didn't I lend you that as well?
- Yes.
- He's from Correggio, did you know that?
- No.
He also wrote for "Linus," one of the magazines I write for.
He was a great writer, and a big puff!
How's it going?
Just the same.
- "Here's the truth" looks well?
- Yes.
Mum is good, she's still on her religious trip.
Is the old man still lost in the world of "Unità"?
Yes.
Even if lately he's really been suffering for the death of...
Of the dearly departed Enrico.
Yes, I read about that before I left.
- He reads those pages every evening.
- Well why not?
He was a good guy.
One of the few.
And you?
- How are you?
- I'm the same as always.
I've interviewed a few people, quite big names...
Not like here!
You're still practising that instrument?
Well, here and there, a bit when I have time.
Here.
This is my what I use for work.
I might write a few articles to make some money before going back.
Look.
This is for you.
All the way from...
London!
- Thanks, Sam!
- No problem.
Put it on, listen to it.
- Will you go back?
- I hope to.
You should come and visit me you know?
I really missed this old place.
It's an incredible place!
- Do you want a drag?
- Yes.
There are some great people up in London.
What type of people?
Boys, girls, good times...
Come on, come and visit me.
Emilia...
All around the 284 columns of the square young people stuck up posters with drawings in favour of peace.
At midday, the young people were met by the Pope who came out on to his balcony and exhorted them to keep working for a better world, full of friendship, solidarity and love.
- Hi, Maddalena.
- Hi, Giovanni.
- Is everything ok?
- Yes, thanks.
- Hi, sorry I'm late.
- Hello dear, don't worry.
Tonight's meeting we'll be held in my mother in law's room, upstairs.
I'll follow you up.
Make yourselves at home.
- Do you know where your brother is?
- No, I don't.
I guess he's around somewhere, he's not two years old.
Calm down.
Come with me, Maria.
But no one has seen him!
Don't worry yourself about him.
Just keep watching television, don't mind us.
Comrades, put all your efforts
in the last few days
before the election in a last great burst
which the communists have always managed to pull off at crucial moments...
"There was a man who had two sons. "
"The younger son set off for a distant country"
"and there squandered his wealth in wild living. "
"After he had spent everything, he began to be in need. "
"So he decided to set out and go back to his father. "
"But while he was still a long way off,"
"father saw him and was filled with compassion for him. "
"He ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him. "
"The father said to his servants,"
"Quick!
Bring the best robe and put it on him. "
"Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. "
"Bring the fattened calf"
"and kill it.
Let's have a feast and celebrate. "
"But the other son, when he found out, said to his father,"
"All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. "
"Yet you never gave me even a young goat"
"so I could celebrate with my friends. "
"But when this son of yours"
"who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home,"
"you kill the fattened calf for him!"
"My son, the father said,"
"you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. "
"But we had to celebrate and be glad,"
"because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again;"
"he was lost and now he is found. "
- Thanks.
- Thanks to you, William.
Maddalena, come here!
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.
Okay.
Wait a minute.
- Come back and visit us when you can.
- Yes.
I'd love that if I'm passing.
- Bye, sweetie, thanks for everything.
- Thank you.
Say hi to your folks for me and look after yourself.
Of course I will.
Arrivederci.
Bye.
Bye.
I heard about your brother.
Anyone could have predicted it.
Once a bastard, always a bastard.
So you know each other well?
Yes.
Since when?
Do you remember the guy with the cigarette?
Him?
Fuck, why didn't you tell me earlier?
- Why should I?
- Because he's my brother!
- You don't seem very brotherly.
- Well, exactly.
- When were you together?
- I don't remember.
Two or three months, we were just kids!
- Is it really so important?
- No it's not.
- I don't give a flying fuck.
- Well, I wouldn't say that.
And anyway, today we're nothing to each other me and your brother.
Why, sorry?
Elia...
Your brother doesn't like women.
- No?
- No.
Anyway...
- That's not the point.
- What is the point then?
I told you before, you guys you are so undecided.
Thanks.
Tell her you thought about her.
See you soon, Maria!
So you managed to add to the confusion, didn't you?
- What?
- Bye.
This music, it's so...
Is that a review or a contraction?
Both.
It's resonance therapy.
Combined with acupuncture, it's gonna get those contractions under control good thing Matthew couldn't make it today...
- because he would hate this.
- It's soothing.
Okay.
You know, when Dr. Bennett did the IVF,
- she let us bring in our own CD.
- What'd you put on?
Well, the first time we just picked all these songs that we used to love in high school.
And then... the second time we used this muzak that was supposed to relax me, but just made me feel like I was having a gynecological appointment in an elevator.
And then the third time, we just picked every song
- that we could think of with the word "luck" in the title.
- And it worked.
- Ah.
- You okay?
Don't worry.
It's just... it's been like this the past couple of mornings.
I think baby Langston does not like breakfast burritos.
Okay.
You start your torture, and I'll just run a te... ah!
- Ah!
Ooh.
- Okay, hang on.
Send Naomi in, please.
Sorry.
It's not usually this bad.
Mm.
Okay, focus on your breathing.
- Ooh.
- Slow and deep.
Shira, what's wrong?
Strengthening contractions, a minute apart.
Oh!
Oh, this could be real labor.
At 25 weeks?
- Can you make it stop?
- Well, we can,
- but we're gonna have to get you to the hospital.
- I'm all wet.
I think my water just broke.
It's blood.
Thanks.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I was just thinking about you.
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm trying to figure what to wear to Maya's wedding.
Oh.
Uh... whatever.
Sam, women don't do well with "whatever."
Well, what are you gonna wear?
What?
Uh, I have a million things to do to get ready, and picking out a tie is not high up on the list.
What is high on the list?
I have to write a toast.
- Oh, I'm good at toasts.
- Yeah, I know.
I know that.
I...
I knocked on your door last night,
- hoping that you could help...
- But I...
I wasn't home.
Yeah.
Look, you, uh, you don't want this to be weird.
And... and I'm trying to make this not weird.
But, uh, you weren't... you weren't home.
Yeah.
I was... out.
Look, Sam, I'm just gonna say this, and hopefully, you're gonna understand, and it won't be weird and...
I'm seeing someone.
Addison.
There's an ambulance downstairs.
We need you.
It's an emergency.
It's a placental abruption.
This much blood, the placenta could be completely detached.
It's gonna be hard to control the hemorrhage
- and get that baby out fast enough.
- Oh, no, please.
He's not ready yet.
- Do you have any terbutaline?
- I don't know if we do.
- The book says that he's the size of a cucumber.
- There's no terbutaline, no magnesium sulfate.
- Can she make it?
- I can already feel the baby's head.
- No, no, please.
- This baby's coming now.
No!
We're gonna get you into surgery and get your bleeding stopped.
- Your husband's on his way.
- The baby?
- Dr. Montgomery's with him.
- He was so small.
Will he be okay?
- She's gonna do everything she can for him.
- But will he be okay?
I didn't feel... anything 'cause the doctor... and I was counting...
- They didn't nick his brain or anything, right?
- You know, they go in through the groin for a hernia repair, so I doubt it.
I just think Ike has a little bit of an anesthesia hangover.
- Dr. Scott.
- Hey.
I'm so sorry, buddy.
They made me scrub in on another surgery right after yours.
- Wasn't nearly as cool, though.
- So everything went okay here?
Yeah, absolutely.
I sutured in a mesh patch.
- Gonna last him a lifetime.
- Great.
So how long is he gonna be kinda...
- Oh, he'll be himself in an hour or so.
- I am myself.
Listen, just let him, uh, rest a while.
I'll swing by and check him.
- You're gonna be outta here before dinner.
- Thank you.
Take care.
Oh, man, I'll tell you.
I jacked up my back.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah, I was playing that, uh, computer tennis game.
I realize it's a goofy injury.
But, you know, the last few days
I've been, uh, eating fistfuls of ibuprofen just so I can stand up in the O.R.
Actually, man, would you mind, uh, writing me a prescription for a couple of oxy?
- Oxy a little heavy for a gaming injury?
- Ah, it's just two or three, just to get me through today and tomorrow.
Then I'm gonna take the weekend off and rest up.
Hey, listen, if... if... ow.
If it's a big deal, don't worry about it.
I'll suck it up.
Hey.
Hey.
You want to grab lunch later, away from here?
I can do that.
Oh, hey.
You know... you know Charlotte King, don't you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, is he the doc that...
- Yeah.
- Oh, I see.
- I hope this isn't gonna be a thing.
- It's not a thing.
Okay.
Great.
- I'll call you later.
- Mm.
Problem with this?
Not a thing.
You don't rsvp two days before a wedding.
I'm sorry.
My friends have never done this.
You better watch that tone, young...
All right.
We're gonna talk about this later.
I don't even care if they come.
- If it's gonna be this big a deal...
- Enough about the wedding.
Well, if you're done, she has an appointment.
You okay?
- He looks like his head is about to pop off.
- Don't tell anybody, but around here, it always looks like your dad's head's about to pop off.
- I guess I should be happy he's coming at all.
- I'm sorry about your mom.
- She's making me feel like I'm doing something wrong.
- Did you try talking to her again?
Well, you know, I...
I know how hard this is.
I mean, I remember.
You know, Heather and her mom they never got past it.
- But with your mom...
I think you should try again.
- I don't think my dad would like it.
- He's mad at her.
- Well, it's your wedding, Maya.
Does he really need all of that?
He weighs less than 2 pounds, so we need to keep him under the lights to regulate his body temperature.
We're also trying to correct a pretty serious electrolyte imbalance that's causing convulsions
- and exacerbating a cerebral hemorrhage.
- His brain is bleeding?
How can he have so many problems?
25 weeks is just the cusp of viability.
Addison, his abdomen is distended.
Yeah, we did an x-ray.
He has necrotizing enterocolitis.
I...
I don't know what that is.
I means that not enough blood is getting to his digestive tract.
- His intestines are dying.
- Is that somethin you can fix?
He'd need surgery to try to resect his bowel and save some of the intestines.
Matthew.
So this surgery... can we do it now?
Uh, that's up to Dr. Montgomery.
You need to understand that it wouldn't be just one surgery.
There would be a whole series of surgeries.
And in between, he would need to eat through a feeding tube and breathe with the help of a ventilator.
He'd be suffering.
And even if we did manage to keep him alive, it's unlikely that we could give him any kind of normal life.
You need to consider if...
this is something that you want.
What's our alternative?
Ending his life?
Yes.
That's not a life...
shuttling back and forth between the O.R. and NICU, being kept alive by machines, his system overloaded with drugs.
He's their child, and none of us can say we know what's gonna happen.
- Odds are you're right.
- I am right.
- There have been cases where severe enterocolitis resolves.
- So you're on the side of miracles now?
I understand why they are,
- and I'm not gonna fault them for it.
- I am not faulting them, but...
That baby is suffering.
He's only a couple of hours old, and you can already see it in his face.
You can hear it in his cries.
He's in pain.
Letting go is not giving up.
It would be them
- putting the baby's best interests ahead of their own.
- Naomi?
You know, kids don't come with guarantees.
They come with problems.
These problems can't be solved.
A lot of problems can't be solved.
You just... you learn to live with it.
No one should have to live with this.
No, we're not gonna tell the coles what to do.
- They have to decide what they can live with.
- But I'd have to do the surgery, so I need to decide what I can live with.
Corinne... hey, what are you... what are you doing here?
Oh, I told Maya I'd pick her up.
She came in to do...
- A prenatal appointment.
Yeah, I know.
- I'm taking my daughter-in-law-to-be on a mini spa day... massage, facials, and then a test run for her makeup and hair.
- Uh, I...
- I'm just trying to make this special for Maya.
I think the wedding will be special enough.
Well, if we just go through the motions, do you really think it will be?
I...
I know this isn't what you or Naomi wanted.
It's... it's not what I wanted, either, but it's what's going to happen.
So I've made peace with it as best I can, and now I feel we should make this as positive an experience as we can for the kids.
So is Maya here?
It's not a thing, but the guy's a surgeon.
- Who's dating Charlotte.
- That has nothing to do with the fact that he hit me up for a prescription.
He barely knows me, and he's asking me for narcotics
- that would slow him down, impair his judgment.
- Well, look, look, look.
I am on antidepressants.
Sometimes it makes it hard to focus, which is not ideal when I'm in therapy.
Sam's on allergy meds.
When he ups his dose, it knocks him out.
You just have to hope that someone's gonna be responsible.
- Do... do you have any reason to think that Scott wouldn't be?
- Nothing concrete, but when he saw that I was uncomfortable,
- he backed off fast, and it felt practiced.
- Well, he...
I've heard he's a good surgeon.
- He seems like a good guy.
- What, you've met him?
Oh, she had him to the house, didn't she?
- My God, she gives it up fast.
-Cooper, y...
- What, what, am I wrong?
- He has not actually been to the house.
He's just... picked her up there.
But I don't think that they're...
- Yeah, well, you're just saying that to be nice.
- But she is bringing him to Maya's wedding.
He's her plus one.
I have the list.
I have all the lists...
caterers, deejays, florists.
I am knee-deep in wedding,
- and the sad part is, I have never had one of my own.
-That is sad, but back to me.
No one told me that plus one was an option.
Cooper, the wedding is in two days.
- If you are thinking of scaring up some random hoochie...
- Oh, no, I'm thinking about inviting Jordana Sampson.
Is she back in town?
Mm-hmm. - Cooper, no.
- She's not random and she's not a hoochie.
- I know, but she's...
Exactly.
You didn't take that personally, did you?
- Is there a reason I should?
- No, no.
- Then I won't.
- Me either.
It's a professional disagreement.
Yes.
So... are you still good with...
Yes.
I think so.
I don't know.
I told Sam this morning that I was seeing someone.
- I thought we weren't gonna...
- No, we're not.
It's just... he came to my house last night.
I wasn't home.
- I didn't want to lie to him.
- You didn't tell him it was me?
No, no.
You haven't told anyone, have you, like Violet?
I...
I wouldn't even know what to say.
Because... this...
Mm-hmm.
With us...
Mm-hmm.
We're just...
Just getting through what we're getting through.
Mm-hmm.
We're just helping each other... mm.
Helping each other feel good.
Really... really good.
Want to see if that door locks?
Maya.
What are you doing here?
I want you to come to my wedding.
Even though you're not proud of me, I kof course I love you.
- Do you think it would be better if I didn't get married?
- Yes.
- I...
I...
I don't know.
- It wouldn't.
- I'm just trying to do the right thing, but I need you.
- You needed me long before this, but somehow, even though I tried, I wasn't there for you.
And so for me to sit down in front of God and everyone we know for a formal, public reminder
- of how badly I screwed up your life, I...
- That's not what my wedding is.
That's what it would be to me.
The whole time we were trying to get pregnant,
Matthew kept telling me to visualize what it would be like
- when we were in the hospital, when we were finally a family.
- Yeah.
After a while, I...
I wanted to stop.
It's just too hard, you know?
And it just felt like it was never gonna happen.
But Matthew... he kept promising it would.
He called the baby "our dream deferred."
Oh, like the poem.
- Langston Hughes.
- Yeah.
We're English teachers.
Can I... can I hold him now?
Oh, we can't... we can't take him out.
Even for a minute?
I'm sorry.
So how soon can we do this surgery?
I told Matthew, at the rate the baby's bowel function is deteriorating, you'd have to do the operation today, right?
It's what they want for their child, and I told them, if anybody can help them here, it's you.
Dr. Montgomery...
Please.
I'll book an O.R.
He was supposed to discharge Ike almost two hours ago.
- We kept paging him.
- I'm really sorry.
I said Dr. Scott was probably busy sewing someone's brains back in.
Well, there might have been an emergency where he was sewing somebody's
- something back in.
- Still...
No, I... he should not have left you hanging.
I'm really sorry.
All right.
You're all set to go.
- I hope that follow-up is the only thing that he's careless about.
I heard there was a problem with your patient.
No.
Actually, there's a problem with your boyfriend.
He asked me for oxy this morning, now he's MIA.
And you're assuming what?
- He has a bad back.
- Well, as his girlfriend,
I'm sure you're very sympathetic.
But as chief of staff of the hospital where he works,
I think you should be concerned about how he's treating it... if it's his back.
If you want to make a formal complaint, do it.
That's what I thought.
Hey.
Hey.
You working on the toast?
Trying.
Look, Sam, about what I said...
- We don't need to talk about it.
It's none of my business...
- No, Sam...
Addison, please.
Not today, okay?
I...
I c...
I can barely get through this.
What do you want to say?
I want to tell them stop, you know, and don't make this any worse.
I just tried to give that speech.
A patient of Pete's gave birth to a preemie... 25 weeks, just... so many problems.
Best-case scenario, it lives in the NICU until I can't do any more surgeries
- or give it any more drugs.
- Are you and Pete in sync?
You said it was Pete's patient, right?
Right.
It is.
But we're not in sync.
I am a... about to go remove most of the baby's intestinal tract because the parents are hoping for a miracle, and Pete doesn't want to take that away from them, and I couldn't say no.
So I gotta clear my schedule and head back to the hospital.
Well, I get that... doing things you don't want to do.
I'm supposed to make this big speech that makes everybody feel good about the wedding...
Pretend like everything's okay.
Sometimes weave to pretend.
Eloping?
Oh.
No, no, I'm just taking the dress to get steamed.
It's... it's Maya's.
I figured.
Yeah.
Well, you know, it should be a pretty odd event.
You know, uh, Cooper's bringing Jordana Sampson.
She's back?
- Oh, wow.
-I know.
Y... you're not bringing someone else are you, a... a plus one?
Uh, because among other things, I'm the rsvp girl, so, um, I'm just, uh, making sure.
Nope.
Just me.
You?
Same.
I'll see you there.
Hey.
You were supposed to discharge Ike Holden.
I had to come over here just so they could go home.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's my... my back.
It was killing me.
I...
I laid down.
I guess I just went out.
Come on.
I know what you're thinking.
You think because I asked you for a... a courtesy prescription, what, you think now I'm...
I'm a drug addict
- who crashed out here?
- Tell me you haven't taken anything.
I...
I took one oxy.
I don't have any other surgeries scheduled?
As long as you're not cutting someone open, anything short of that,
- it's okay that you show up here like this?
- Listen, I'm really sorry that it bothers you that I'm seeing your ex-girlfriend.
- It bothers me
- that you couldn't do your job right now and you're still here.
- I have never had a single problem,
- in this hospital or any other.
- You want that to change?
Are you threatening me?
I think you should go talk to my colleague...
Violet Turner.
She has a lot of experience treating people with addiction...
You want me to see a shrink?
Convince her you don't have a problem, I will lay off.
- And if I don't?
- We will let this hospital sort it out.
You know, somehow I think Charlotte's already decided about me.
Maybe, but I haven't.
How's it going?
Addison?
Addison?
There are no clear margins.
The entire bowel is involved?
There's nothing left I can save.
Is there anything you can do?
I can close him up.
- But he survived the surgery.
- Yes, he survived, but...
Then there must be something you can do.
Your baby doesn't have a functioning digestive system.
So before I could do anything,
I'd have to put a central line in through his stomach to feed him.
- And how long would he have to have that?
- Permanently.
And although I was able to stop the cerebral bleed, we have to assume that there is
- at least moderate brain damage.
- But you don't know that for sure.
No, I don't know that for sure.
But it's more than likely the case.
Just like the longer we keep him on a respirator, the more likely it is that he'll have retinal failure or that he'll go blind.
I'm not saying there aren't miracles, but at a certain point, it's not fair to the baby... to Langston... to keep waiting for them.
What are the odds?
I want to know the odds.
Of a baby like Langston living outside the NICU?
Less than 1%.
But it could happen?
And it's our decision?
Uh, yeah, it is.
But he's in pain.
And with so little to hope for, I'm sorry,
I'm not comfortable performing another surgery.
Are there other doctors that we can get to help us?
Yes, you could find someone else to put in a central line.
Then that's what we'll do.
Will you please help us?
I'm sorry.
I understand if you want to go a different way, but I can't.
So are the... are the drugs something new?
"The drugs".
The drugs are the occasional oxy that I take when my back flares up.
You know what?
Here you go.
Take 'em, toss 'em, eat 'em.
Do whatever.
- That tell you what you need to know?
- Uh, well, the fact that you are carrying narcotics in your pocket tells me that you may have a more serious problem
- than you're admitting.
- It's funny how much you sound like your buddy Cooper.
- This has nothing to do with him.
- This has everything to do with him.
He resents my dating Charlotte.
He can't seriously call into question my judgment or my hand skills or anything else that matters.
So he's trying to make me out to be some kind of junkie,
- and you're helping him.
- I'm just asking questions, trying to understand.
- And I'm certainly not forcing you to stay here.
- No, Cooper is.
- You're free to leave.
- I do that, he makes an issue of it with Charlotte.
- Does that worry you, Charlotte knowing about this?
- I'm not an addict!
Why are you so angry?
I don't know.
Well, maybe we can keep talking,
- find out if there's something there.
- I'm a good doctor.
Which is why you should also stop seeing patients
- until we get a handle on this, whatever it is.
- And how do I explain that, to Charlotte, to the doctors who refer me, the patients I already have scheduled?
It will be easier than trying to explain what happened if you hurt someone.
I can help you if you want me to.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
- I called you last night.
- Oh, sorry.
No, no, no, I just was worried about you after you walked out.
- I'm okay.
- Okay.
Well, for what it's worth, I agree with you.
Enough is enough.
Yeah.
- Addison...
- No.
No, no.
- What?
- Not in my office.
- I was just trying to be a friend.
- Well, just, you know, be a friend from there.
Will this help?
Hey, Sam, you got a minute?
I wanted to talk to you about the wedding.
- Uh, talk to Violet.
- No, no, it's not a Violet thing.
- Not now.
- No, now, Sam.
Look, I...
I get that this is hard for you, okay?
But it doesn't change the fact that Maya's gonna get married tomorrow, and you signed the paper so that she could, and now you're making her feel like crap about it.
I will be there at the wedding.
I will walk her down the aisle.
Okay, but showing up and acting like this?
I mean, it's no better than what Naomi's doing.
And someone has to be there for her, to be happy for her,
- to... to support her, and if it's not either of...
- I'm trying.
Try harder.
Oh, hey.
Where you going?
I am going to pick up Maya and Dink's wedding rings.
It's just another thing that I can check off this list of errands I never thought I would do for anybody.
Hey, uh, before you go...
So should I be worried about Scott or...
If I thought he was dangerous, I would report him.
That's all I'm gonna say.
What?
Were you talking about me?
- No.
- No.
You were talking about Scott.
- Look, I am not gonna say anything to either one of you.
- And you shouldn't.
Unless of course you care about the health and safety of any of the patients he might treat at the hospital
- where he works, cutting them open.
- Which, roughly translated, means "please, violate privilege
- to give me some dirt on my ex's new man."
- I...
I don't care about you and him.
I do care that he's probably smart enough not to trigger Violet's duty to report, which means he's gonna have to hurt someone
- before anyone takes action here.
- I'm...
I'm not getting in the middle of this.
You know who needs therapy here?
You.
Cooper Freedman.
Yeah, Ike Holden is my patient.
What happened?
And who's doing the surgery?
Sam.
How's Maya doing?
How do you think she's doing?
She's getting married tomorrow, and you're not gonna be there.
Where are you gonna be?
I'm going to...
I'm going to Napa... with William.
- Wow.
- I don't expect you to understand...
Of course I understand.
You think I don't want to do the same thing, just run away from all this?
But I can't, because someone has to be the adult here.
And you left that to me.
- I didn't mean for this to be like this, Sam.
- Just like you're not gonna mean for Maya to start going to Corinne with her problems or for Corinne to be the one she wants around when the baby comes, and then in a little while for Corinne to be the one
she starts seeing as her family.
Because if you keep doing what you're doing, that's what's gonna happen.
So grow up.
Do your job.
Be a mother.
Now what?
Tell me you are not doing this surgery.
Ike has significant ischemia.
If I don't restore the blood supply, he could die.
Now I don't know what he's told you, but this happens in a small percentage of hernia repairs.
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- You don't have to explain the medicine to me.
- Just tell me if you've taken anything today.
- You're kidding.
- You do realize your ex-boyfriend has issues?
- Tell me there's nothing in your system.
No oxy, nothing.
I don't have time to play games while a kid's on the table.
Stop.
Dr. Barker, I said stop.
I talked to Dr. Graham at County, who said he'd take over.
Do you think he's good?
I trust Dr. Montgomery's judgment.
He's good.
Graham's good.
hey.
everything we wanted for him, all the silly dreams we used to talk about...
We were gonna expose him to great books and art.
And he was gonna grow up to be so cultured.
And one day people like us were gonna teach kids about him.
I know that's gone now.
But that's not what matters.
What matters is... he's ours.
And I just want him to understand that we're still here for him and that we love him.
A child can feel his mother's love.
He knows you love him.
No, he doesn't.
He can't, because I've never even touched him.
Well, there is a way...
- For you to hold him.
- Don't say that.
Shira, I wouldn't, ever, if I thought there was any hope.
But at some point, you have to know when to let go.
Could you?
Um...
I'd hope that I had the strength to do what my child needed, no matter what the cost to me.
We should.
No.
No.
There's a chance.
Look, I'm not letting go.
There's a chance.
Look at you.
Fillmore's not gonna know what hit him.
I...
I'm gonna leave you to have some time alone with your dad.
Check on the groom, make sure he brushes his hair and knows how to tie that tie.
I'll see you at the church.
It's going to be wonderful, Maya.
I promise.
Whew.
I know this isn't what you wanted, but... please... be happy for me.
I am.
I am.
Honestly?
Honestly, I'm...
I'm a little worried.
- But if this is what you want...
- I do.
Okay, well, then you need to know that I love you,
I will always be here, and that I'm gonna help you make sure that ultimately, this is gonna be wonderful.
Okay?
Okay?
Hey.
How's Scott?
Trying to get better.
Checked himself in somewhere last night.
I hope he does.
I do.
You want to say I told you so.
But I won't.
Life's hard.
You shouldn't judge.
Everybody needs some kind of a crutch.
So I don't wind up sitting next to a 15-year-old texting the whole time, would you mind if I...
Don't be an ass, Cooper.
Make room for the girl.
Hi, I'm Jordana Sampson.
Here.
I can't.
Sometimes when you want something so badly... and you get it... even if it's only for a minute...
You don't want to let go.
I understand that.
It could change.
I mean, he could...
He could get better.
You're hurting him, and your job as a parent is to make sure that nothing hurts him.
I love him.
Then let him go.
I thought...
I can't believe mommy's really not coming.
I thought she'd be here.
I know.
I hoped she would.
Okay.
I think it's time to go.
Yeah.
Mom.
My mother gave this to me on the day that I married your dad.
So... this is your, um, your something old... borrowed and blue.
Thank you.
And for your something new...
I bought it for your 16th birthday.
I always wanted one when I was a girl, so...
"M.B." Maya Bennett.
I hope you'll keep the name... and remember where you came from.
Okay.
Now you're ready.
Tell me she didn't destroy her life.
Tell me I didn't.
Oh, Nai.
Look at her.
Maya may be a lot of things right now, but... she is not destroyed.
Have each of you chosen to come here today and declare before God and his church your decision to become husband and wife?
I have.
I have.
And who give this woman to be wedded to this man?
Her mother and I do.
Hey.
Thanks.
It was what you deserve.
Uh... you, uh, you save me a dance, okay?
I was not waiting in that line at Sam's.
And Addison has much nicer skin care products.
Your little friend spilled bruschetta on my dress.
- Oh, I'm sure she didn't mean to.
- Of course she did.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Why'd you bring her?
Why do you care?
I mean, apart from the tomatoes.
If you'll excuse me, I have to take this dress off and clean it.
Mm.
Uh, first off, I'd like to thank everybody for coming.
I know I speak for Naomi and Corinne and Maya and Dink when I say that we feel so very blessed that you all came and shared this special event with us.
Seeing Maya in this wedding dress,
I'm struck by what a beautiful and elegant young woman she has grown up to become.
And I know that moving forward, this image of her will stay with me, the same as another image of Maya in a different pretty white dress has stayed with me as well.
The dress I'm talking about was white, but it had red and blue abc's all across the front.
I, uh, I remember,
I came home one evening after a... a marathon of kids' parties and whatnot, and little miss Maya was not quite ready to take her little dress off and get in the bath.
So we went to her room and hung out on her floor, started talking.
And out of nowhere, she told me that when she grew up, she wanted to marry me.
So, uh, I said, "why?"
I asked her, I said, "why me?"
And she looked up at me, and she said, "because, daddy, you are my anyway friend."
Now at the time, I didn't know what that meant.
So Maya had to explain to me that an anyway friend is the one person in your life who, no matter what they say or do, no matter what they've been through with you, they love you anyway.
So my sincerest hope is that for Maya, Dink, and for Dink, Maya, is that anyway friend.
Because no matter how old you are or what your responsibilities, if you have love... real, unconditional love...
I think you can make it.
So... to my anyway friend and her anyway friend.
May you not only make it...
But enjoy it.
Thank you.
Hungry?
Oh.
Well, I'm just seeing how good everything is.
It is my food... my flowers... the place... the music.
This is my wedding.
Hey.
It was a beautiful speech, Sam.
Sam?
When you slept with Mark Sloan...
I didn't really say anything.
But Pete... he's my friend.
He's my friend, just like Naomi is your friend, but...
I guess that doesn't really matter to you.
- Sam...
- Please.
It's my daughter's wedding.
I'm trying to be happy.
So I'm gonna put this aside.
But, um...
I don't want to see you.
I'm gonna go dance with my daughter now.
May I have a dance with my daughter?
The only way to do our job...
expose corruption... is get someone on the inside.
I met a couple of blokes out here, detectives, and we're thinking of going into business for ourselves... your old business.
GERRY:
This kind of surveillance work can be dangerous.
I'll do it.
EDDIE:
Joe Dooley's gone.
He's doing the D's course.
TREVOR:
What?
Detective Joe Dickhead?
AGIUS:
In light of that recording, do you wish to alter your previous statements in any way?
There's a rumour going round someone's dogged us already.
If I find out one of us is dogging, they'll end up with a bullet in their head.
We'll relocate, yep, but it's gonna be without you, Trevor.
I want you to look me in the eye and swear that when you get on that stand, you will not make me a liar.
SONG: # It's a jungle out there
# It's a jungle out there
# It's a jungle out there. #
You right?
Yeah, I'm just jumpy.
Don't like waiting.
I was supposed to hook up with Jimbo this morning, but he pulled out.
Straightaway I'm thinking, "What's wrong?"
Here.
What?
We gotta talk, mate.
The boys are suss.
They don't want you doing the pick-ups anymore.
What?
Have you heard something?
Yeah, I heard a lot, mate.
I'm just trying to work out how much of it's true.
Are you talking about the royal commission?
Jesus.
Are they about to pick me up?
Look, do you think I would be here if they were about to pick you up?
You...
Look...
You're just a bit hot at the moment.
That's all.
Changing the pick-up arrangements is just a bloody precaution.
I'm going nuts here, mate, bloody paranoid.
As far as this goes, I'd rather see the back of it anyway.
MAN:
And bing.
We got him.
Haken's doing good work.
I swear to God, if it wasn't against regulations,
I'd nominate Trevor for an Oscar.
EDDIE:
So?
What did he say?
I've told ya Trevor's solid.
Yeah?
Yep.
Well, Captain Jack saw him getting out of a van with black tinted windows.
Tinted windows?
Oh, well, must be the Feds, then.
I mean, who else has tinting, hey?
Bill Bayeh reckons he's suss and that prick usually knows what's what.
Yeah, well, fuck Bill Bayeh.
Look, I've been a cop for 20 years.
I think I can tell when a bloke's lying or not, alright?
Chook, the last time I saw Trevor, he was acting bloody weird.
He's shitting himself, Jim.
Now, if that makes a bloke a dog, I'll buy you a kennel right now.
Now, just so no-one else is pissing in their pants,
I told Trevor to hand over the pick-ups.
Oh, yeah?
Who's gonna do them?
Oh, no, mate.
Since you and Chook are gone, I've been snowed under.
Mate, Jimmy Egan sleeps at his desk.
Mate, the rest of them, they're just kids.
Yeah, I know, mate.
You're the only one still working the Cross who's got a clue.
Oh, mate, to top it off, Sarah's got the gastro and little Bobby's being potty trained.
I tell you what, he's not exactly a natural, you know?
Pissing all over the place.
Yeah, I got kids.
I've been there.
It's tiring.
But look, Scull, this thing with the pick-ups, right, it's only gonna be for a couple of weeks.
Help us out, hey?
Yeah, alright, mate.
You tell Billy we're on.
We put Chook Fowler and Neville Scullion on the stand, they will both swear on a stack of Bibles they have never taken a cent.
And then we wheel out Louis Bayeh and he names them both as being on the take.
Trevor Haken, Fowler, everyone...
they all get paid.
They get paid plenty money... $12,000 every week they come collect.
AGIUS:
I've been working with him on his testimony.
Louis is coming across as almost credible.
Both Fowler and Scullion know they're facing perjury charges if the other one flips.
If either one of them loses his nerve, we smash Kings Cross wide open.
GERRY:
And we've still got Haken up our sleeve.
He's still covert, still gathering evidence.
Neville Scullion.
You are hereby served.
Have a nice day.
What's the bloody emergency?
I have been summonsed to testify.
So you come down here to tell me the news?
I am shitting myself.
Mate, I've been doing the pick-ups for Trevor.
And I am no good in court.
I'd get rattled in the stand.
You know that.
Pull yourself together, Scully.
Come on over here, mate.
When are you on?
The 15th, next Thursday arvo.
Right.
Well, I'm on Thursday morning.
After I leave, I'll tell them to go easy on you, alright?
You've been summonsed too?
Why didn't you give me the call on that?
Scully, when they summons ya, they watch ya.
Now, if I come running straight to you, then that puts you in their sights.
And vice versa.
Oh, shit.
I...
Sorry.
Chook, I didn't...
Spilt milk, mate.
I'm sorry.
Look, I'm up first, OK?
You do what I do and you follow my lead, we'll both be fine, alright?
And we'll face these bastards down together, alright?
RALPH GRIFFIN:
Corruption is a team sport, believe me, so finding out who Eddie Gould's accomplices are is our second objective.
And what's our first objective?
Getting him back here.
This is where we'll get our best results in terms of surveillance.
So where are the cameras exactly?
Oh, all around.
It's probably best you don't know exactly where they are 'cause you tend to play to them.
So basically I'm just meant to get on with my life, not knowing whether or not you're watching me?
Relax.
After a while, you'll barely even know they're there.
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYS)
I like her, the one with the big titties.
Krystal?
She doesn't do sex.
She's certainly not shy about putting it out there.
She's a stripper.
It's her job.
Look, I don't want scrubbers.
I run a knock shop, I want my merchandise to be top-quality, like her.
Put your money on the table, then.
She'll be big bucks.
The money's a bit tied up at the moment.
It's bloody expensive setting up a brothel.
What about the investors?
Tap them on the shoulder.
Oh, I'm tapping.
You just gotta be patient.
How about I talk to them, hm?
I can be pretty convincing.
I bet you can.
JACQUI JAMES:
With a major investigation looming, a rational person might think that things in the Cross would've quietened down, but for most of the key players on the Golden Mile, rationality didn't come into it.
Billy Bayeh was a man with a serious gambling habit and the more pressure he felt, the more he gambled.
So for Bill, winding back his operation wasn't an option.
Across the road,
Danny 'DK' Karam had his own habits to feed.
They included steroids, heroin, cocaine, even marijuana just to take the edge off.
And lately he'd found himself a snorting partner just as irrational as he was.
Harry 'Hammer' Hammoud.
That's not to say there weren't any clear heads in the Cross.
They just had the good sense to keep a slightly lower profile.
Listen, I need money.
What?
You want a loan?
A loan?
No, I don't want a loan.
I don't know, mate.
You asked for money.
Billy owes us for next week.
I'll take my cut of that.
Billy's paid so I don't know if I can do that.
Well, you can pay us for next week in advance.
We've got a good thing going with Billy.
Listen, Hammer, I know you're living day-to-day, but what about all the other days?
Don't you wanna make them better?
Billy uses us.
Billy would be nothing without us.
He'd be nothing without me.
DK:
You take your fucking hand off it!
Stand back, Danny.
Stand down.
Leave my fucking plates!
Joe!
Joe, come here.
Hey.
Danny, Danny, calm down.
Tell me what the problem is.
The car is unregistered.
It's got half a dozen warrants against it.
Pickles was taking off the plates.
(CURSES IN ARABIC)
OK, OK, OK.
What the fuck are you doing, Dooley?
You piece of shit.
Think about what you're doing.
You slimy piece of shit.
I kill you.
I kill you.
Danny, I would stand back if I were you.
Because if you don't, I will arrest you for threatening a police officer.
Alright?
!
Danny, if you drive an unregistered vehicle...
JOE:
Let it go.
He'll keep.
(ENGINE STARTS)
I would like to conclude the preliminary proceedings with a final warning.
Tomorrow we will begin taking formal evidence.
If you are a police officer who is engaged in corrupt activity and these activities are exposed by this commission, you ought to understand the consequences will be very grave.
For those who acknowledge wrongdoing, things may go easier, but for those who choose not to cooperate, the consequences will be severe and will impact not only on you, but on your whole family.
I'm fucked.
They're onto me.
No, mate.
If they had anything solid, they'd move.
They have moved.
They're busting me down to uniform.
Me!
That's a vote of no confidence, that is, Trev.
That's a big bloody vote.
You reckon it's connected to the commission?
I've gotta get out, mate.
I've gotta get out of testifying, I have to get out of the job.
I've gotta go while the going's good.
Hurt on duty, go for stress.
No stress.
None of that bullshit.
No, I need a nasty proper accident.
Now, I'm thinking about the lobby at work.
The floor's made out of granite or some bloody thing.
Yeah, it's slippery as buggery.
So I spill something on there, like a milkshake or something, and I go for six.
Then you're out.
Yeah.
But no bastard hears about this, Trevor, alright, or I'm fucked.
Not Egan, not Scully, no-one.
Nup.
Fucking arseholes.
SEAN:
Look, you know I wanna help you out, mate.
It's just the way things are right now, it's bloody tricky.
I looked after you.
Hey?
I set you up, son.
I know, I know, it's just...
I've been trying to keep my head down.
So when things were good, you were keen to be my mate, but now things are a bit tough, it's like, "Oh, bugger Chook.
"Stuff him, hey?
Let him sink."
Looking after number one, is that it?
Is that it?
No, no.
Of course it's not.

EDDIE:
Chookie.
Yes, mate.
This thing here, is this permanent?
Edward, go and get us some glasses before I hit you on the head with this.
Righto.
(LAUGHS)
Oh, well, not such a bad time to go out.
Twist of fate, Jimbo, you know?
I mean, I reckon I had years of service left to offer, but the gods have spoken, so...
(SCOFFS) What's wrong with you?
Look like they sat you in a used bedpan.
A bit nervous, you know?
I'm up tomorrow at the commission.
(POURS A DRINK)
Yeah, well, you know I'd be there if I could, Scully, but like I said, mate, twist of fate.
Thanks, son.
Hey, listen, mate.
There's something I gotta tell ya.
Hmm?
When you've been a detective around this place for as long as I have, you, you know, overhear certain things that you might not, you know, necessarily otherwise overhear.
Well, let me guess.
Eddie Gould's a cross-dresser?
I hear Danny Karam has been looking for your home address.
Shit.
Now, we can fix this, right?
Jim and Eddie, they'll load that prick up with enough smack to put him away for 5 to 10.
No, I don't want to do that.
But you don't have to do anything.
Jim and Eddie will do it.
I don't want them doing it either.
(STAMMERS)
Alright. (SIGHS)
I'II, you know, I'll wise up the uniform boys.
We'll get them to look out for DK.
Thanks, Scull.
Just do us a favour, yeah?
From now on, you take your firearm home.
What's this in aid of?
The old locks...
they were, uh, museum pieces.
I thought it was time we updated.
Mm-hm.
Should I be worried?
No.
Why would you be worried?
Has something happened?
Well, yes.
This has happened... you acting weird like something's wrong.
Ellie, come on.
Everything is fine.
Just, you know, we're getting married.
I guess I should be looking after you properly, huh?
Off you go.
OK.
G'day, Danny.
You following me all day?
No.
We got a tip that people use this premises for injecting drugs.
Joe fucking Dooley sent you.
No-one sent me.
But you remember... we're all cops.
As far as I'm concerned, it's touch one, touch all.
(BANGING AT DOOR) OK!
(BANGING CONTINUES)
Hammer.
Hey, mate, we're not open yet.
Come in.
Have a drink.
What are you doing?
What are you doing, you stupid fuck?
!
You're supposed to look after this place!
Take it up with Johnny.
HAMMER:
I told you I was gonna get a cash advance.
And I told you we're running a business here.
So what?
Yeah, a security business, mate, and Billy's a customer.
This type of shit hurts us.
(GRUNTS)
What's he gonna do if I don't deliver, huh?
He's gonna sack us?
It hurts my rep, mate.
The only rep you got is hanging behind me.
Come on!
You want a go?
Come on, mate.
Huh?
Relax, relax!
The only brains you have are mine, bitch!
(MEN YELL AND JOSTLE)
Come on!
Come here!
Huh?
Come on, boys.
Fuck!
Hey, bro!
Bro!
You're Hammer, yeah?
I'm Doc.
I'm looking for work.
Work?
No, listen.
I can do stuff for you.
Stuff?
Old prick back there, Mr Blow-Wave...
That prick is the smartest operator in the Cross.
Won't be smart with a knife in his balls.
If I ever fucking see you around here again, I'm gonna kill you.
Do you understand?
I'm gonna kill you.
Alright?
Now get the fuck out of here.
Get out of here!
Get out of here.
Get the...
Why a little boy like you want a gun?
A tough guy pushed me round.
I'm gonna shoot him.
You got cash?
A grand.
Hey, hey!
Relax!
You want a gun?
I need cash.
Meet me here tomorrow, same time.
You get what you want.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
Well, well, well!
Don't you look the part?
Nice place.
Actually, it's a shit hole, but it's not bad for what you're earning.
I'm late for work, Eddie.
Well, you're the one that's always asking me to come around.
Well, here I am.
Is something wrong?
There is, actually.
We've got money issues.
I was thinking you might wanna go back on the job for a minute.
What?
You know, a bit of hooking.
I'm a cop.
Come on!
You're a hooker playing at being a cop.
Oh, fuck you.
I'm trying to help you here.
Unless you wanna be living in shitty places like this for the next 10 years, you ought to think about lending me a hand.
Hey?
I'll let myself out.
AGIUS:
Mr Scullion, do you know Benjamin Kassab, usually called Benny Kassab?
SCULLY:
I do.
How would you describe him?
In my opinion, he's a drug dealer.
A drug dealer now facing serious charges, but not as a result of any action taken by you.
Action without evidence doesn't count for much in court, at least not in a real court.
Prior to Kassab's arrest, did he ever offer you any money to turn a blind eye to his activities?
Never.
Have you ever been offered money by a person engaged in criminal activity, whether they were urinating behind the fountain or dealing hard drugs?
I have not.
Do you think that's the general experience of your colleagues?
I am certain that it is.
(SNORES)
Mr Fowler.
(GRUNTS)
I have a warrant for your arrest.
What?
You're in contempt, Mr Fowler.
"Refusing to answer a summons to appear before the commission."
No, no.
I'm...
I'm injured.
I, uh, sent in a medical certificate.
Which the Commissioner rejected.
I'll have the police union on you.
Uh, look.
The Commissioner says that I should defer executing this until tomorrow.
Now, the nurses tell me that they're discharging you in the morning, so you could just pop on over and, um, see us.
You know, on your way home.
Or I could come over and arrest ya.
Your choice.
Mr Fowler, how would you react if I told you that we had compelling evidence that large-scale drug distribution took place in the Cross during the time that you were chief of detectives there?
Well, I'd be surprised if you hadn't found that.
I knew about it myself.
But knowing about it and making arrests, that's two different things.
So you would deny that drug dealing thrived as a result of your knowing connivance?
That suggestion's a slander.
And you've never been involved in any way with the collection or distribution of corrupt monies paid by drug dealers?
I have not.
Corruption and you were complete strangers, in other words?
That's correct.
You haven't had any relationship with your police colleagues where they might pass money on to you for any purpose?
I have not.
Detective Scullion, for example...
has there ever been an occasion where he's paid you a substantial sum of money?
No, there has not.
Detective Sergeant Trevor Haken...
the same again?
Yeah, I've already told you, the answer's no.
And your injury...
a fall outside the lift at work... that must have come as quite a shock.
Well, yes, obviously.
And is it causing you quite a deal of pain?
Yes, it is.
Well, then maybe we should allow Mr Fowler to return to his recuperation.
I have no further questions.
I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God.
AGIUS:
Mr Bayeh, I'd like to start by asking you some questions concerning corrupt payments you've made to police officers in the Kings Cross area.
I can't answer no question today.
I beg your pardon?
I am crook.
I no sleep.
I...
I no sleep.
Mr Bayeh, in this hearing room, you must answer all questions put to you or face contempt proceedings.
Well, you may say that you object to answering and if you choose to do that, the answers you give cannot be used against you unless, of course, your evidence is false or misleading.
Would such a choice help to put you at ease?
Yes.
Because I no sleep.
I'm crook.
I've got bad headache.
AGIUS:
Mr Bayeh, once more, the objection protects you in that the answers you give may not be used against you in other proceedings.
It does not excuse you from answering.
Mm.
(STAMMERS)
Uh, Your Worship, can I say something?
Why not?
I've got nothing to hide.
I'll tell you everything.
But there's been a contract now five time on my life from NSW Police.
If I answer question, they kill me.
I get killed.
WOOD:
Are you aware of this claim, Mr Agius?
Until two minutes ago, it was my understanding that Mr Bayeh was eager to answer our questions, notwithstanding his headache.
Well, in the light of Mr Bayeh's allegation,
I feel inclined to stand over further evidence from this witness until we can ensure his safety.
(FUNKY MUSIC)
(MUTTERS)
HAMMER:
What's up?
Joe Dooley is dead man.
You're kidding.
Detective Joe Dooley?
He thinks he can fuck with me.
Now I fuck him.
He's a cop.
When his head's blown off, he'll be a pile of shit for me to piss on!
Hey, hey, take it easy.
Yallah.
Yallah!
Come on, mate.
Hey!
DK, hey!
You gotta think about this.
Come on, man, hey?
You're living in the day, man.
You gotta start thinking of the days you got coming.
Shut up or I shut you up.
Hey!
Shut up!
(GRUNTS)
Oi!
OFFICER:
Break it up!
Break it up!
Danny Karam!
DK:
Dooley, I'll fucking kill you!
(YELLS INDISTINCTLY)
JOE:
I am arresting you for assault.
(ALL GRUNT)
Fuck you, Dooley.
I'll fucking kill you!
...actual bodily harm.
Do you understand?
Arggh!
Get down!
(TENSE MUSIC)
(MUTTERS INAUDIBLY)
Hey?
Bloody hell.
I thought 'go-kart' was code for something.
(CHUCKLES) Nah, I've been building this for over a year now, mate.
I started building it for the kids, but they're probably getting a bit old for it now.
Yeah.
They grow up so quick, it's hard to keep track.
Yeah, well, you tell yourself you're working for your family and you come home from another bloody 10-hour day and you realise you don't even bloody know them.
So I heard they're, um, calling you back, the commission.
Yeah, listen, mate.
Through all this bloody business that's been going on, you've been listening to me banging on and on about my troubles and I know you've had troubles of your own.
Well, I haven't been summonsed yet, so...
No, I'm not talking about that, mate.
It's, uh this holiday that Maria's gone on.
She's obviously taken the kids, yeah?
Yeah, yeah, she has.
Mate, we all knew that you were having trouble at home, but I don't reckon we made it any easier for... for you.
And that was wrong.
It's not the way mates should behave.
But, look, mate, if you don't want to talk about it, that's fine.
I mean, I don't like to stick my nose in normally.
Oh, no, no.
It's fine.
Yeah, OK, OK.
Look, sorry, mate.
I gotta go to the loo.
You know where it is?
Just up there, mate.
EDDIE:
Ahem!
Here's to another half-arsed, lame-arsed, dumb-arsed...
That's a lot of arses, mate.
(LAUGHS) ...turd-arsed royal commission.
May it end soon and save us poor little taxpayers some money.
ALL:
Hear, hear!
Yeah, make the whole thing go away.
This is a bloody good money-making opportunity.
What if there is a really big shake-up down at the Cross?
Well, the old earners might not be on anymore.
Then what are you gonna do?
Mate, you kick in to this project and I guarantee you in a month, you will double your money.
After a year, the sky's the bloody limit.
OK.
KIM:
He talks about his partners, but I'm starting to wonder if he's actually got any.
These pricks always run in packs.
You've just gotta earn his trust.
What more can I do?
You wouldn't consider his suggestion?
Go back to the brothel for a bit?
What?
Well, we... we just thought it would be a way to open the investigation up.
This uniform is my life now, not hooking.
You got that?
OK, yeah.
Just...
Alright, you better go now.
I've got an appointment with the director of the academy.
Oh, you are on the move, Kimmy.
So are you, Ralph. 'Bye!
MAN:
It's come to my attention that you're doing some work for the royal commission.
I'm not supposed to discuss that, sir.
I don't need to know about operational details.
What concerns us is the reason you came to their attention in the first place.
Sir?
I understand you used to work as a prostitute.
Yes, that's correct.
Yet in your police application form, you've made no mention of prostitution.
It said to put down my last three jobs.
It says your last job and the three before that... four in total.
You've listed three and one of those is "TAFE student", which is not an employment.
I guess I misread the form.
It gives the appearance of a false declaration in a signed statement.
That's a sacking offence.
(SOLEMN MUSIC)
(TENSE MUSIC)
FOWLER:
I am not resentful about being investigated, but I am resentful about the methods.
We ordinary police... if we had your powers and resources to catch real criminals, by God, what a great state we'd have.
AGIUS:
So you think that if any concrete accusation was put up, you could answer it... is that right?
Yeah, I do.
I'm going to show you some video excerpts.
While you're looking, I'm sure a number of things will be going through your mind.
What I'd like you to remember is that this video was produced for your consideration by the good people of NSW whom you are sworn to serve.
FOWLER ON TAPE:
Look, you're just a bit hot at the moment.
That's all.
Changing the pick-up arrangements is just a bloody precaution.
Yeah, you're right.
Eh?
I'm going nuts here, mate, bloody paranoid.
As far as this goes, I'd rather see the back of it anyway.
I need a nasty proper accident.
Now, I'm thinking about the lobby at work.
The floor's made out of granite or some bloody thing.
Yeah, it's slippery as buggery.
So I spill something on there, like a milkshake or something, and I go for six.
Do you recognise the other person in the video, Mr Fowler?
Haken.
It looked like Trevor Haken.
We don't want to prolong this unduly, Mr Fowler, but the fact is you have been deeply involved in corruption.
Is it not?
No, I have not.
WOOD:
You talked about falling on a milkshake just days before it occurred.
That's... coincidence, is it?
Uh, yes, it could've been, Your Honour.
And the money you were seen to receive?
Do you have any explanation for that?
It, uh, might not really have been me.
WOOD:
Are you suggesting that we cobbled this video together, got an actor to play you and then pretend to take the money?
Funny things happen, Your Honour.
AGIUS:
At this stage, Mr Commissioner, there's another witness we wish to call... someone who has been assisting us with our inquiries... but I ask that Mr Fowler remain present to hear his evidence.
That Chook, he's a bloody tight-arsed old pisspot, but he's been good to me.
He's a crook.
We all did it.
I call Detective Sergeant Trevor Haken.

SONG: # La-di, da-di, da-di-da
# There was a boy who cried to me His tears were full of misery
# And every day his tears would form a sea

WOOD ON TV:
It must be clear to you now that you can no longer rely on the police culture of mateship and silence.
The vast majority of serving police are honest, decent and dedicated.
In the past, they may have turned a blind eye to your wrongdoing because of the consequences of speaking out.
But now those days are over.
Mr Scullion, when you previously gave evidence before the commission, you were not able to provide any information or evidence concerning police corruption.
That's correct.
Since then, you've reconsidered your position and you've come here with the intention of assisting us.
Is that right?
Yes, it is.
You have been personally involved in corrupt practices at Kings Cross Detectives.
Is that correct?
I have taken money off drug dealers.
I've picked up money, I've distributed money.
I've turned a blind eye.
I'm crook.
I'm a crook cop.
Well, here's to Inspector Chook Fowler.
He was a loyal mate.
And a fair boss.
EDDIE:
And a bloody good cop who knows how to keep his mouth shut, unlike some other maggots we could name and choose not to.
May they rot in hell.
Here's to it.
I heard DK was up this arvo.
Yeah, he got done for the assault charge, acquitted on the firearms.
Six months.
He'll be back in three?
Yep.
That's the system.
Those blokes had their own system.
It wasn't perfect, but it got results.
(PEOPLE CHATTER)
So, big win today, mate, flipping Scullion.
(CLEARS THROAT) Trevor, um, these drinks, they're for the investigative team.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I understand that.
So the Commissioner would like you to leave.
What?
But I've been part of this investigation for six months.
But you're not part of the team, are you?
You're an informer.
I'm a detective, a detective bloody sergeant!
Hey, you might still go to jail so just give it a rest, mate, and do as you're told.
SONG: # When you come round
# And I fall out with myself
# It's not my fault
# That I can't stop
# And I am withered in doubt... #

Chook Fowler was eventually convicted and sentenced to three years' jail.
Neville Scullion resigned from the police, but was never charged.

# Shake it off, shake it off... #
Trevor Haken lost his job, his wife, his friends and his future.
15 years later, he's still lost.
Frobisher had my fiancé killed.
This is a tremendous book.
Let me option this, and I want to play you.
Louis Tobin had to start moving the money down there before he confessed.
And on Thanksgiving night, Tessa started moving it out.
Patty Hewes asked you about Thanksgiving night?
I appreciated you not talking to her about it.
We are not going to approach Tessa Marchetti now.
What are you talking about?
We've got no leverage.
I don't need you or your protection.
I shouldn't have approached Tessa.
I'll tell Patty.
And if she finds out, blame it on me.
Ellen Parsons, she's been talking to Patty Hewes.
The truth is, we do believe the Tobins were involved in your mother's death.
What should I do?
Call this number.
This is Tessa Marchetti.
I'm just a couple blocks away from your office.
You're under arrest.
Do you know who that is?
She babysat for you and Carrie.
When we were kids, you used to tell me I was adopted.
Her name's Anne Connel.
All I could get was an address.
It's about a hundred miles outside of the city.
Can I help you?
Ms. Connel?
I'm sorry to bother you, um... my name's Ellen Parsons.
Yes?
Do you remember me?
Ellen?
Curtis Gates arrested Tessa Marchetti.
For what?
I have no idea.
That's why she never showed up here.
So Gates just happened to arrest her right when she was coming to talk to us?
Looks like it.
How the hell would he know to do that?
I have no idea.
Why am I under arrest?
Because of your boyfriend.
What?
He's a citizen of Antigua.
So?
He's been living here in New York for the last three months on an expired visa.
Well, how is that my fault?
Well, he entered the country with you and he lives in your apartment.
It's a crime to house an illegal alien, Ms. Marchetti.
Look, he's going to get it renewed.
I didn't do anything.
You can't arrest me for this.
Well, I'm sorry, but I can.
I want to talk to a lawyer.
Of course.
I think you should.
Any lawyer in particular?
Tessa Marchetti wants Patty Hewes to be her lawyer.
Arresting Tessa was the right move.
Yeah, I should thank you.
We would've missed this opportunity if you hadn't told me that Patty was working with Ellen behind my back.
Just doing my job.
Hey... you're not going to fire Ellen, are you?
As soon as she comes back from wherever the hell she is, send her to my office.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Why did you decide to find me?
I had a dream about you, actually.
Um, did you ever cook for me?
Many times.
So, you say you're an attorney now?
Yes.
I'm glad things worked out so well.
I was always worried about you.
Why's that?
And I was very sorry when I had to let you go.
Let me go?
What... what... what does that mean?
Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.
No.
It's okay.
I...
I...
I want you to tell me.
Ms. Connel, were you...?
This is a very strange question, but, um... was I adopted?
I'm not your mother, Ellen, if that's what you were thinking.
But I did...
I lived with you at some point?
Oh, dear.
No one ever told you?
My mother just said that you were our babysitter.
Yes, I was.
When you were four or five.
And that was all it was?
Ellen, things in your home were bad when you were young.
Bad how?
I never really knew all the details, but your father was very unhappy, very angry.
I always thought your mother should've left him, but with two small girls, she was scared to be on her own.
She couldn't handle you and your sister.
So she... sent me to you?
You were happy at my house.
Your mother knew that.
Uh, how long did it last?
You lived with me maybe six months.
And then, one day your mother asked... if I was interested...
In making the arrangement permanent.
Your parents didn't adopt you.
It was the other way around.
I don't understand.
Your mother asked me to adopt you.
And what did you say?
I said "yes."
I adored you.
But your mother decided she couldn't go through with it.
So, she brought you home.
And after that, she didn't want you to see me again.
I understood.
Your mother loved you, Ellen.
She did the best she could.
I talked to my client.
You have nothing on Tessa Marchetti.
You're holding her on a technicality.
So, what's your point?
I thought you didn't detain people without cause.
Yeah, well...
If I've learned one thing on this job, it's to remain flexible.
Tessa is the key to my case right now.
I need her to find the Tobins' money.
Uh-huh, well, she's in my custody.
Sooner or later you're going to have to let her go.
That's true.
And you can wait for that eventuality, but I doubt you have the time.
So, why don't you just give me what I want?
Which is?
You've been working behind my back with Ellen
Parsons on Danielle Marchetti's murder.
I want evidence.
I'm not ready to make a deal.
Hey, it's Tom.
Look, I'm sorry I screwed up, but your boss arrested Tessa
Marchetti and the shit hit the fan.
I've never seen Patty like this.
Where are you?
Hello, Ellen.
I left messages.
Why haven't you called me back?
Leave it.
How did Gates know you were helping me on the case?
I'm sorry.
It was my fault.
Because as soon as he found out...
Gates went straight to Tessa
Marchetti and arrested her.
I approached Tessa.
I thought that I could get her to cooperate, and then the whole thing blew up in my face.
It was a mistake.
A mistake?
Was it?
Or have you been trying to humiliate me this whole time?
What?
Pretending to help me.
When what you really wanted was to get close to Gates.
No.
You used me.
'Cause it's always been about ambition with you.
You act like you care about the case.
All that... crap... about your family.
Your sister's wedding.
I fell for your bullshit.
But I know you now.
I see you.
You're a climber.
A parasite.
And you're ruthless.
Just... go.
I want you out of my apartment.
I want you out of my life.
May I remind you, Mr. Frobisher, you're under oath.
Yeah, I'm well aware.
So, you considered your company sort of like a family, didn't you?
Very much like a family.
And was it your job to hold the family together?
Yes.
It was.
And you failed.
Objection.
I'm warning you, counsel.
I'll rephrase.
Was it very painful for you when you failed?
Objection.
You keep this up and we're going to have ourselves a problem.
Would you agree the crumbling of that relationship was nothing less than, really say, the dissolution of a marriage?
You better watch what you say.
Is that your position?
Or was the failure of that relationship, as you call it, your failure?
Your deceit, your breach of trust, your absolute infidelity to your employees?
I admire you, Ms. Hewes, I really do.
But we're very different.
Is that so?
You've made a career out of crushing people who stand in your way.
And whereas you seek to destroy, I seek to create.
I've always felt it was my duty to inspire the people who work for me.
So that together...
together... we can build something remarkable.
What did you think?
It is such a huge help to hear this thing out loud.
We're still, you know, doing some fine-tuning, but it's...
Something's off.
Reading great.
Arthur, do you, um, do you not think the script's working?
There's something off, you know?
Something's missing.
Yeah?
I don't know the protocol.
Can I...?
Oh, by all means.
Tell them whatever you want.
Listen...
Hey, that was great, by the way.
Now, listen to m this is Patty Hewes you're playing.
The kind of woman who eats her young.
I mean, when she looks across the table at the Frobisher character...
She is pure, unadulterated evil.
Okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
And you...
Jesus, it's uncanny.
It's like... it's like seeing a ghost.
I want to tell you something though.
Ray Fiske was gay.
Oki?
Toss that in and play with it a little bit, all right?
And no makeup next time.
It's just a workshop.
Okay, uh...
I can't tell you how sexy you are.
Let's take it from the top.
Whenever you're ready.
May I remind you, Mr. Frobisher, you're under oath.
I'm well aware.
Do me a favor, will you, Toby, and grab us a couple of coffees?
You can finish the shoes later.
Tessa Marchetti's in custody.
Custody of who?
The D.A.
They got her on what charge?
It's unclear.
God!
Using a 24-year-old girl as a courier?
Was that the best idea my father could come up with?
He had to scramble, Joe.
Why didn't he have a goddamn plan?
He did.
Of course he did.
But the government surprised him and they started to move in too quickly, and...
We were forced to improvise.
I brought these, Lou.
You wanted the heels fixed on your boots.
They're going to get me, Stu.
I can't hide it anymore.
It's okay.
She knows about the fraud.
You met with the sec?
Yeah.
It's only a matter of time before they put two and two together.
Jesus.
Louis, are you okay?
Do you have your pills?
Sweetheart, get me a glass of water, please?
Okay.
Yes.
I'm going to tell my family tonight.
And then I'm going to turn myself in.
It'll be easier on the family if I just... get it over with.
Are you ready on your end?
Everything's set with the charity, but...
Here you go.
Thanks, Dani.
Give us a minute.
Yeah, of course.
We've got to start making those transfers tonight.
Lou, this is happening too fast.
We don't have a courier yet.
How soon can Emanuel authorize a signatory for the account?
As soon as you need.
That's not a problem.
But who are you going to use?
I don't like doing this.
But there is someone we can trust.
He chose Tessa?
Tessa was his daughter.
Of course he trusted her.
How much does she know?
Only that she was depositing paychecks.
What about the documents she signed?
She know where the money was going?
Absolutely not.
She never knew what she was signing.
So there's nothing she can tell the authorities.
And you're sure of that, how?
Because your father was smart and careful.
Smart?
He got caught.
Okay?
I'm not going to let that happen to us.
Tessa was always loyal to him.
Doesn't mean she's going to be loyal to me.
Listen to what I'm telling you.
Tessa Marchetti doesn't know anything and she's on your side.
So calm down and don't get paranoid.
Four?
- Four people... in the corner...
- Arthur, Terry's ready for you.
Oh, my God.
Man, if I knew I was this good-looking, I would've tried a different line of work.
Actually, can you give us a minute?
Yeah, everything okay?
Yeah, I just want to talk to Art.
Sure.
Take your time.
Fantastic.
Really, really.
Just remarkable, man.
It's not working, Art.
What... what's not working?
Any of it.
I mean, the hair and the clothes are fine.
What's the problem then?
None of it feels authentic.
You know, it feels too on the surface.
I need to be able to go inside you and figure out what drives you.
That's the only way I can truly find the part.
That sounds great.
Do it.
No, you don't get it.
See, when we were workshopping the depositions...
No, but that's going to be a great goddamn scene.
Now, once we get a, you know, a top-flight actress in there... elevate the whole thing.
Really.
Could be a great scene...
but it's dishonest.
What do you mean by that?
Why... why is it dishonest?
I read the stenographer's transcription from your actual deposition.
Now, I don't know what you told the screenwriter, but you never waxed philosophical with Patty.
You went ballistic.
- All right, but...
- No, it was great!
It was terrific!
It was uncensored!
It was unfiltered!
That's what I need to get in touch with.
My anger?
Your dark side.
I need access to it.
Otherwise, this is just candy coating.
You are a complicated man.
You have an underbelly that most people never get to see.
Of course.
I have to be able to see it.
All right, all right.
We'll just, uh, have to show you my... my underbelly then.
What is this?
What you need to arrest Carol Tobin for Danielle.
Marchetti's murder.
Thank you, Patty.
Uh, give me a chance to look it over.
If it's what I need, I'll release Tessa immediately.
I don't want you to release her.
I'm sorry?
Not officially anyway.
I would like the Tobins to think that she's still in custody.
So what do you need from me?
We can't trust Tessa.
If Zedeck is confident she'll protect us, he must have his reasons, Joe.
I don't give a shit what Zedeck says.
Her mother is dead, okay?
The D.A.'s office is going to use that to win her over.
Your father has supported Tessa her whole life.
She has every reason to protect us...
I am responsible for this family now, Leonard.
I am responsible!
And she is not family.
Why should she be loyal to us?
She's a problem.
What should we do?
You've hired people before, right?
To find Carol, to have me followed...
God knows what else.
There have to be options, Len.
Tessa is in custody.
We can't even get to her.
Well, they can't hold her forever.
Joe, look at me.
I'm your attorney.
I need you need to listen.
I can't let you do anything stupid.
It's not about you.
If you're not willing to help me deal with it.
I am, I am...
If you're not willing to help me deal with it, I can understand.
Joe, I am...
I'll find somebody else who can help me.
Thank you for letting me sit in on the Tessa Marchetti meeting.
It'll be a great experience for you.
I'm going to include you more from now on.
I would love that.
When the Tobin case is over, Tom and I are going to want someone who's ready, Alex.
Someone who could step up, take more responsibility in the firm.
I look forward to it.
That's why I came here.
You sabotaged this office.
You withheld evidence and you took it to Patty Hewes.
Right?
Nick told you?
Yes, Nick told me.
He has respect for his job.
I wasn't trying to undermine you.
I believed Patty would find information that would help us prosecute the Tobin family for the fraud.
Oh, so you were doing it to help me?
I was doing it to help the case.
That's all you have to say?
Well, it's the truth.
Are you firing me?
Right now, I don't want you around here.
You're on leave indefinitely till I make my final decision.
Go home, Ellen.
We're going to get you out of here.
Thank you.
But first, we want to know the truth about Thanksgiving.
I lied to you, Ms. Hewes.
I was with my mother that night.
We know.
We also know you changed your route with the airline that day.
Yeah, I made my first flight to Antigua.
Why?
Who sent you there?
Louis wants me to fly tonight?
He needs you to.
He's in trouble, Tessa.
He may go to jail.
How often does he want me to go down there?
Just once a week.
You'll deposit your paycheck and sign some documents at a bank.
Hello?
I left my pills.
Please bring them over.
Isn't your family there?
I don't care.
Leave them in the lobby.
Louis, are you sure?
Just do it, Danielle.
Goddamn it, just do it!
Okay.
I have to go.
Mom, you know more than you're telling me.
The documents you'll be signing will be sending money to a charity.
That's all you'll be doing.
I promise.
Take this.
Call Lenny.
Tell him to come pick these up.
No one can know that I spoke to Louis tonight.
Trust me, baby, it's going to be okay.
Your mother said you were helping transfer money to a charity?
Yes.
Was I stupid to believe her?
No, no, the Tobins were involved with several charities.
Do you remember if your mother mentioned one by name?
I don't think so.
When you were cashing your paychecks at the
Royal Antiguan Bank, you mentioned that you signed three documents.
Yeah, in order to get American currency.
Is it possible that a charity's name was on that third document?
I don't think so.
I would've seen it.
Do you have copies of that document?
No, they keep everything at the bank.
Do you remember anything about that form?
Not really.
I signed it so many times, but it was just a bunch of numbers.
Numbers and, um, maybe some random letters.
Could be an iban.
What's that?
Routing codes for transferring money to an account in the U.S.
Tessa, how would you feel about going back down to Antigua?
Whatever you need.
What does Tessa actually know?
We're not sure.
I know that look, Lenny.
What else is wrong?
Protecting the money is the only thing that matters to Joe.
He's not thinking clearly.
What do you mean?
Tessa isn't safe.
Lou never would've wanted anything to happen to her.
You have to intervene.
How?
Tell Joe the truth.
You didn't tell him?
It's not my place, Marilyn.
You need to.
Joe needs to know Tessa is his daughter.
I'm Malcolm.
I'll be keeping an eye on you in case you have any sudden urges to contact the Tobins.
Don't worry.
I won't.
Thank you for letting Tessa out.
See what can happen when we decide to work together?
Ah, shit.
Oh, you are good.
I'm glad you liked it.
You are a fun kid.
So, how's it feel to be me?
I could get used to that.
No, hmm-mm.
Well, no pressure.
I just...
I just thought you were looking for the underbelly.
Come on.
Shit.
I'll trade you.
Now, there's something you've got to understand.
Here, cheers.
Cheers.
This is not just about pleasure.
No, huh?
No.
No, all of this... all of this releases me.
In fact, I...
This is the spot I came to to make the biggest decisions of my life.
Who to lay off?
Screw you.
No, I mean it.
Screw you.
No, no, I, uh... there's a rawness that, um, I get in touch with.
And I find clarity in that.
I find clarity in darkness.
This is the kind of stuff I want to know.
How dark do you get?
All right.
How far would you go...
to protect your money?
Your family?
What would you do if every single thing that mattered was being threatened?
Threatened how?
Someone out there.
You know, someone who could take everything.
Shit.
Shit.
And then, what-what if a man came up to you and he said...
"I can make all your problems go away.
Forever"?
What would you have to do?
Nothing.
Just say the word.
What could he do for you?
Anything.
Shit.
That's the dark side, my friend.
It doesn't get any darker than that.
Art... what kind of shit are we talking about here?
What's up?
I want you to cut off any communication with Ellen.
Why?
Either she was sloppy or she disobeyed me.
What makes you say that?
She told me she approached Tessa.
Even after I told her not to.
That's how Gates found out about what we're trying to do.
Patty, h... hold on.
I let my guard down.
I should never have let her back in.
Look, uh... whatever Ellen told you, she was... covering up for me.
She didn't approach Tessa.
I did.
I'm sorry.
I was...
I was...
I was impatient, and I...
I screwed up.
The truth is, Ellen tried to salvage my mistake.
She was the one who steered Tessa back to us.
Why did you do it?
I did what I thought I had to.
So the two of you were strategizing behind my back.
And then you lied to me about it.
Yeah.
I lied to you.
Have you ever lied to me?
I've got work to do.
I made a judgment call, and I took a risk.
I'm done apologizing.
I'd like you to start looking for new cases.
Excellent.
Any particular area?
Um, bring me whatever you're most passionate about.
Uh, maybe pharmaceutical class actions or constitutional violations.
Alex, you can bring whatever you want.
That's how we work here.
Okay.
Did you tell him?
Yes.
Joe's going to leave Tessa alone.
Are you okay?
Louis should have told Joe sooner.
He couldn't.
Joe wouldn't have been able to handle it back then.
He couldn't take care of himself, much less a child.
Well, now he knows.
You all set?
Yeah, I'm ready.
All right.
You'll go to the bank like it's business as usual.
Make your deposit, sign the paperwork.
And I keep the third document.
We shouldn't be seen together, so you'll leave now.
I'll be waiting for you across the street from the bank.
Get in the car, and we'll go straight to the airport.
Got it.
You're out walking in the middle of the day.
Work's been a bit iffy.
Suddenly got all this time on my hands.
Must be nice.
I guess.
I don't know what to do with myself.
You went to see that woman.
Yeah.
My babysitter.
What were you expecting to find?
I don't know.
- I was hoping...
- Hoping what?
I'm not sure.
It was stupid.
Know, you've always been trying to rewrite your family history.
What do you mean?
Well, you started by being the good girl who never got in trouble, then the perfect student.
Now the successful attorney.
I finally figure you and Patty.
Ah?
You both hate bullies.
It's what drives you.
Your father was a bully.
And I remember, Ellen.
I saw it.
How he treated your mom and Carrie.
And you couldn't stop him.
You were helpless.
And that's why you're drawn to Patty, she's not.
But, Ellen... if you want to keep working for Patty, go back to her.
If not, then really move on.
Stop talking to her.
Thanks, David.
I'm sorry.
For what?
I haven't been thinking about you as much as I used to.
That's good.
But I haven't forgotten.
I miss you.
It's nice to see you, Mary.
If Tessa comes through, we'll need to cross-reference the routing codes.
With a list of every bank in the U.S.
I pulled it already.
And, uh, we'll need a list of charities.
I've gone through the Tobins' 1040s.
I figured I'd start with the charities they donated to regularly.
If that's how the Tobins laundered the money...
What did you think of Alex Benjamin?
She's smart, ambitious, very dedicated.
She'll fit right in.
Yes?
You were saying?
I'm glad you like her.
I didn't say I liked her.
Patty?
I'm sorry, Alex.
It's not working out.
What's not working out?
You.
I don't understand.
I think you do.
Are you firing me?
It's not personal.
Take the afternoon and clean out your office.
Malcolm?
Malcolm?
I have the document.
I thought you were gonna meet me at the bank and...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Tessa Marchetti?
Please.
No.
No.
Yes?
Emanuel your fears were well-founded, Mr. Tobin.
Ms. Marchetti came back to Antigua.
But all is well.
Mr. Tobin, are you there?
Thank you.
The money's safe.
It's not your fault, Joe.
Your father had a daughter with Danielle Marchetti.
This was his mistake.
You did it for your child.
You did it for all of us, for our f... for our f... our future.
You had no choice.

Previously on "Damages"...
Frobisher had my fiancée killed.
This is a tremendous book.
Let me option this, and I want to play you.
Louis Tobin had to start moving the money down there before he confessed.
And on Thanksgiving night, Tessa started moving it out.
Patty Hewes asked you about Thanksgiving night?
I appreciated you not talking to her about it.
We are not going to approach Tessa Marchetti now.
- What are you talking about?
- We've got no leverage.
I don't need you or your protection.
I shouldn't have approached Tessa.
I'll tell Patty.
And if she finds out, blame it on me.
Ellen Parsons, she's been talking to Patty Hewes.
The truth is, we do believe the Tobins were involved in your mother's death.
- What should I do?
- Call this number.
This is Tessa Marchetti.
I'm just a couple blocks away from your office.
You're under arrest.
- Do you know who that is?
- She babysat for you and Carrie.
When we were kids, you used to tell me I was adopted.
Her name's Anne Connel.
All I could get was an address.
It's about a hundred miles outside of the city.
Can I help you?
Ms. Connel?
I'm sorry to bother you.
My name's Ellen Parsons.
Yes?
Do you remember me?
Ellen?

Curtis Gates arrested Tessa Marchetti.
- For what?
- I have no idea.
That's why she never showed up here.
So Gates just happened to arrest her right when she was coming to talk to us?
Looks like it.
How the hell would he know to do that?
I have no idea.
Why am I under arrest?
- Because of your boyfriend.
- What?
He's a citizen of Antigua.
So?
He's been living here in New York for the last three months on an expired visa.
Well, how is that my fault?
Well, he entered the country with you and he lives in your apartment.
It's a crime to house an illegal alien, Ms. Marchetti.
Look, he's going to get it renewed.
I didn't do anything.
You can't arrest me for this.
Well, I'm sorry, but I can.
I want to talk to a lawyer.
Of course.
I think you should.
Any lawyer in particular?
Tessa Marchetti wants Patty Hewes to be her lawyer.
- Arresting Tessa was the right move.
- Yeah, I should thank you.
We would've missed this opportunity if you hadn't told me that Patty was working with Ellen behind my back.
Just doing my job.
Hey.
You're not going to fire Ellen, are you?
As soon as she comes back from wherever the hell she is, send her to my office.
Thank you.
Why did you decide to find me?
I had a dream about you, actually.
- Did you ever cook for me?
- Many times.
So, you say you're an attorney now?
Yes.
I'm glad things worked out so well.
I was always worried about you.
Why's that?
And I was very sorry when I had to let you go.
Let me go?
What... does that mean?
Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.
No.
It's okay.
I... want you to tell me.
Ms. Connel, were you...?
This is a very strange question, but... was I adopted?
I'm not your mother, Ellen, if that's what you were thinking.
But I did...
I lived with you at some point?
No one ever told you?
My mother just said that you were our babysitter.
Yes, I was.
When you were four or five.
And that was all it was?
Ellen, things in your home were bad when you were young.
Bad how?
I never really knew all the details, but your father was very unhappy, very angry.
I always thought your mother should've left him, but with two small girls, she was scared to be on her own.
She couldn't handle you and your sister.
So she... sent me to you?
You were happy at my house.
Your mother knew that.
How long did it last?
You lived with me maybe six months.
And then, one day your mother asked... if I was interested... in making the arrangement permanent.
Your parents didn't adopt you.
It was the other way around.
I don't understand.
Your mother asked me to adopt you.
And what did you say?
I said "yes."
I adored you.
But your mother decided she couldn't go through with it.
So, she brought you home.
And after that, she didn't want you to see me again.
I understood.
Your mother loved you, Ellen.
She did the best she could.
I talked to my client.
You have nothing on Tessa Marchetti.
You're holding her on a technicality.
So, what's your point?
I thought you didn't detain people without cause.
Yeah, well...
If I've learned one thing on this job, it's to remain flexible.
Tessa is the key to my case right now.
I need her to find the Tobins' money.
Well, she's in my custody.
Sooner or later you're going to have to let her go.
That's true.
And you can wait for that eventuality, but...
I doubt you have the time.
So, why don't you just give me what I want?
Which is?
You've been working behind my back with Ellen Parsons on Danielle Marchetti's murder.
I want evidence.
I'm not ready to make a deal.
You have one message.
Hey, it's Tom.
Look, I'm sorry I screwed up, but... your boss arrested Tessa Marchetti and the shit hit the fan.
I've never seen Patty like this.
Where are you?
Hello, Ellen.
I left messages.
Why haven't you called me back?
Leave it.
How did Gates know you were helping me on the case?
I'm sorry.
It was my fault.
Because as soon as he found out...
Gates went straight to Tessa Marchetti and arrested her.
I approached Tessa.
I thought that I could get her to cooperate, and then the whole thing blew up in my face.
It was a mistake.
A mistake?
Was it?
Or have you been trying to humiliate me this whole time?
- What?
- Pretending to help me.
When what you really wanted was to get close to Gates.
No.
You used me.
'Cause it's always been about ambition with you.
You act like you care about the case.
All that... crap... about your family.
Your sister's wedding.
I fell for your bullshit.
But I know you now.
I see you.
You're a climber.
A parasite.
And you're ruthless.
Just... go.
I want you out of my apartment.
I want you out of my life.
May I remind you, Mr. Frobisher, you're under oath.
- Yeah, I'm well aware.
- So, you considered your company sort of like a family, didn't you?
Very much like a family.
And was it your job to hold the family together?
Yes.
It was.
And you failed.
Objection.
I'm warning you, counsel.
I'll rephrase.
Was it very painful for you
- when you failed?
- Objection.
You keep this up and we're going to have ourselves a problem.
Would you agree the crumbling of that relationship was nothing less than, really say, the dissolution of a marriage?
You better watch what you say.
Is that your position?
Or was the failure of that relationship, as you call it, your failure?
Your deceit, your breach of trust, your absolute infidelity to your employees?
I admire you, Ms. Hewes, I really do.
But we're very different.
Is that so?
You've made a career out of crushing people who stand in your way.
And whereas you seek to destroy,
I seek to create.
I've always felt it was my duty to inspire the people who work for me.
So that together... together... we can build something remarkable.
What did you think?
It is such a huge help to hear this thing out loud.
We're still, you know, doing some fine-tuning, but it's...
- Something's off.
- reading great.
Arthur, do you not think the script's working?
There's something off, you know?
Something's missing.
I don't know the protocol.
Can I...?
By all means.
Tell them whatever you want.
Listen...
Hey, that was great, by the way.
Now, listen to me.
This is Patty Hewes you're playing.
The kind of woman who eats her young.
I mean, when she looks across the table at the Frobisher character...
She is pure, unadulterated evil.
Okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
And you...
Jesus, it's uncanny.
It's like...
It's like seeing a ghost.
I want to tell you something though.
Ray Fiske was gay.
Okay?
Toss that in and play with it a little bit, all right?
And no makeup next time.
It's just a workshop.
- Okay, let's take it from the top.
- I can't tell you how sexy you are.
Whenever you're ready.
May I remind you, Mr. Frobisher, you're under oath.
I'm well aware.
Do me a favor, will you, Toby, and grab us a couple of coffees?
You can finish the shoes later.
Tessa Marchetti's in custody.
Custody of who?
The D.A.
They got her on what charge?
It's unclear.
God!
Using a 24-year-old girl as a courier?
Was that the best idea my father could come up with?
- He had to scramble, Joe.
- Why didn't he have a goddamn plan?
He did.
Of course he did.
But the government surprised him and they started to move in too quickly, and...
We were forced to improvise.
THANKSGIVING DAY
I brought these, Lou.
You wanted the heels fixed on your boots.
They're going to get me, Stu.
I can't hide it anymore.
It's okay.
She knows about the fraud.
You met with the sec?
Yeah.
It's only a matter of time before they put two and two together.
Jesus.
Louis, are you okay?
- Do you have your pills?
- Sweetheart,
- get me a glass of water, please?
- Okay.
Yes.
I'm going to tell my family tonight.
And then I'm going to turn myself in.
It'll be easier on the family if I just... get it over with.
Are you ready on your end?
Everything's set with the charity, but...
Thanks, Dani.
Give us a minute.
Yeah, of course.
We've got to start making those transfers tonight.
Lou, this is happening too fast.
We don't have a courier yet.
How soon can Emanuel authorize a signatory for the account?
As soon as you need.
That's not a problem.
But who are you going to use?
I don't like doing this.
But there is someone we can trust.
He chose Tessa?
Tessa was his daughter.
Of course he trusted her.
How much does she know?
Only that she was depositing paychecks.
What about the documents she signed?
She know where the money was going?
Absolutely not.
She never knew what she was signing.
So there's nothing she can tell the authorities.
And you're sure of that, how?
Because your father was smart and careful.
Smart?
He got caught.
Okay?
- I'm not going to let that happen to us.
- Tessa was always loyal to him.
- Doesn't mean she's going to be loyal to me.
- Listen to what I'm telling you.
Tessa Marchetti doesn't know anything and she's on your side.
So calm down and don't get paranoid.
- Four?
Four people... in the corner...
- Arthur, Terry's ready for you.
Oh, my God.
Man, if I knew I was this good-looking, I would've tried a different line of work.
Actually, can you give us a minute?
- Yeah, everything okay?
- Yeah, I just want to talk to Art.
Sure.
Take your time.
Fantastic.
Really, really.
Just remarkable, man.
It's not working, Art.
What... what's not working?
Any of it.
I mean, the hair and the clothes are fine.
What's the problem then?
None of it feels authentic.
You know, it feels too on the surface.
I need to be able to go inside you and figure out what drives you.
That's the only way I can truly find the part.
- That sounds great.
Do it.
- No, you don't get it.
See, when we were workshopping the depositions...
No, but that's going to be a great goddamn scene.
Now, once we get a, you know, a top-flight actress in there...
- elevate the whole thing.
Really.
- Could be a great scene... but it's dishonest.
What do you mean by that?
Why is it dishonest?
I read the stenographer's transcription from your actual deposition.
Now, I don't know what you told the screenwriter, but you never waxed philosophical with Patty.
You went ballistic.
- All right, but...
- No, it was great!
It was terrific!
It was uncensored!
It was unfiltered!
That's what I need to get in touch with.
My anger?
Your dark side.
I need access to it.
Otherwise, this is just candy coating.
You are a complicated man.
You have an underbelly that most people never get to see.
Of course.
I have to be able to see it.
All right, all right.
We'll just have to show you my underbelly then.
What is this?
What you need to arrest Carol Tobin for Danielle Marchetti's murder.
Thank you, Patty.
Give me a chance to look it over.
If it's what I need, I'll release Tessa immediately.
I don't want you to release her.
- I'm sorry?
- Not officially anyway.
I would like the Tobins to think that she's still in custody.
So what do you need from me?
We can't trust Tessa.
If Zedeck is confident she'll protect us, he must have his reasons, Joe.
I don't give a shit what Zedeck says.
Her mother is dead, okay?
The D.A.'s office is going to use that to win her over.
Your father has supported Tessa her whole life.
- She has every reason to protect us...
- I am responsible for this family now, Leonard.
I am responsible!
And she is not family.
Why should she be loyal to us?
She's a problem.
What do you wanna do?
You've hired people before, right?
To find Carol, to have me followed...
God knows what else.
There have to be options, Len.
Tessa is in custody.
We can't even get to her.
- They can't hold her forever.
- Joe, look at me.
I'm your attorney.
I need you need to listen.
I can't let you do anything stupid.
It's not about you.
- If you're not willing to help me deal with it.
- I am, I am...
If you're not willing to help me deal with it,
- I can understand.
- Joe, I am...
I'll find somebody else who can help me.
Thank you for letting me sit in on the Tessa Marchetti meeting.
It'll be a great experience for you.
I'm going to include you more from now on.
I would love that.
When the Tobin case is over, Tom and I are going to want someone who's ready, Alex.
Someone who could step up, take more responsibility in the firm.
I look forward to it.
That's why I came here.
You sabotaged this office.
You withheld evidence and you took it to Patty Hewes.
Right?
- Nick told you?
- Yes, Nick told me.
- He has respect for his job.
- I wasn't trying to undermine you.
I believed Patty would find information that would help us prosecute the Tobin family for the fraud.
So you were doing it to help me?
I was doing it to help the case.
That's all you have to say?
It's the truth.
- Are you firing me?
- Right now, I don't want you around here.
You're on leave indefinitely till I make my final decision.
Go home, Ellen.
We're going to get you out of here.
Thank you.
But first, we want to know the truth about Thanksgiving.
I lied to you, Ms. Hewes.
I was with my mother that night.
We know.
We also know you changed your route with the airline that day.
Yeah, I made my first flight to Antigua.
Why?
Who sent you there?
THANKSGIVING DAY
- Louis wants me to fly tonight?
- He needs you to.
He's in trouble, Tessa.
He may go to jail.
- How often does he want me to go down there?
- Just once a week.
You'll deposit your paycheck and sign some documents at a bank.
- Hello?
- I left my pills.
- Please bring them over.
- Isn't your family there?
I don't care.
Leave them in the lobby.
- Louis, are you sure?
- Just do it, Danielle.
- Goddamn it, just do it!
- Okay.
I have to go.
Mom, you know more than you're telling me.
The documents you'll be signing will be sending money to a charity.
That's all you'll be doing.
I promise.
Take this.
Call Lenny.
Tell him to come pick these up.
No one can know that I spoke to Louis tonight.
Trust me, baby, it's going to be okay.
Your mother said you were helping transfer money to a charity?
Yes.
Was I stupid to believe her?
No, no, the Tobins were involved with several charities.
Do you remember if your mother mentioned one by name?
I don't think so.
When you were cashing your paychecks at the Royal Antiguan Bank, you mentioned that you signed three documents.
- Yeah, in order to get American currency.
- Is it possible that a charity's name was on that third document?
I don't think so.
I would've seen it.
Do you have copies of that document?
- No, they keep everything at the bank.
- Do you remember anything about that form?
Not really.
I signed it so many times, but it was just a bunch of numbers.
Numbers and
- maybe some random letters.
- Could be an iban.
What's that?
Routing codes for transferring money to an account in the U.S.
Tessa, how would you feel about going back down to Antigua?
Whatever you need.
What does Tessa actually know?
We're not sure.
I know that look, Lenny.
What else is wrong?
Protecting the money is the only thing that matters to Joe.
He's not thinking clearly.
What do you mean?
Tessa isn't safe.
Lou never would've wanted anything to happen to her.
You have to intervene.
How?
Tell Joe the truth.
- You didn't tell him?
- It's not my place, Marilyn.
You need to.
Joe needs to know Tessa is his daughter.
I'm Malcolm.
I'll be keeping an eye on you in case you have any sudden urges to contact the Tobins.
Don't worry.
I won't.
Thank you for letting Tessa out.
See what can happen when we decide to work together?
Shit.
You are good.
I'm glad you liked it.
You are a fun kid.
- So, how's it feel to be me?
- I could get used to that.
No.
Well, no pressure.
I just...
I just thought you were looking for the underbelly.
- Come on.
- Shit.
I'll trade you.
Now, there's something you've got to understand.
Here, cheers.
Cheers.
This is not just about pleasure.
- No?
- No.
No, all of this...
All of this releases me.
In fact, I...
This is the spot I came to to make the biggest decisions of my life.
Who to lay off?
Screw you.
No, I mean it.
Screw you.
No, no, I...
There's a rawness that
I get in touch with.
And I find clarity in that.
I find clarity in darkness.
This is the kind of stuff I want to know.
How dark do you get?
All right.
How far would you go... to protect your money?
Your family?
What would you do if every single thing that mattered was being threatened?
Threatened how?
Someone out there.
You know, someone who could take everything.
- Shit.
- Shit.
And then, what if a man came up to you and he said...
"I can make all your problems go away.
Forever"?
What would you have to do?
Nothing.
Just say the word.
What could he do for you?
Anything.
Shit.
That's the dark side, my friend.
It doesn't get any darker than that.
Art... what kind of shit are we talking about here?
What's up?
I want you to cut off any communication with Ellen.
Why?
Either she was sloppy or she disobeyed me.
What makes you say that?
She told me she approached Tessa.
Even after I told her not to.
That's how Gates found out about what we're trying to do.
- Patty, hold on.
- I let my guard down.
I should never have let her back in.
Look, whatever Ellen told you, she was... covering up for me.
She didn't approach Tessa.
I did.
I'm sorry.
I was... impatient, and I... screwed up.
The truth is, Ellen tried to salvage my mistake.
She was the one who steered Tessa back to us.
Why did you do it?
I did what I thought I had to.
So the two of you were strategizing behind my back.
And then you lied to me about it.
Yeah.
I lied to you.
Have you ever lied to me?
I've got work to do.
I made a judgment call, and I took a risk.
I'm done apologizing.
I'd like you to start looking for new cases.
Excellent.
Any particular area?
Bring me whatever you're most passionate about.
Maybe pharmaceutical class actions or constitutional violations.
Alex, you can bring whatever you want.
That's how we work here.
Okay.
Did you tell him?
Yes.
Joe's going to leave Tessa alone.
Are you okay?
Louis should have told Joe sooner.
He couldn't.
Joe wouldn't have been able to handle it back then.
He couldn't take care of himself, much less a child.
Well, now he knows.
- You all set?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
All right.
You'll go to the bank like it's business as usual.
Make your deposit, sign the paperwork.
And I keep the third document.
We shouldn't be seen together, so you'll leave now.
I'll be waiting for you across the street from the bank.
Get in the car, and we'll go straight to the airport.
Got it.
You're out walking in the middle of the day.
Work's been a bit iffy.
Suddenly got all this time on my hands.
Must be nice.
I guess.
I don't know what to do with myself.
You went to see that woman.
Yeah.
My babysitter.
- What were you expecting to find?
- I don't know.
I was hoping...
Hoping what?
I'm not sure.
It was stupid.
You know, you've always been trying to rewrite your family history.
What do you mean?
Well, you started by being the good girl who never got in trouble, then the perfect student.
Now the successful attorney.
I finally figure you and Patty.
Yeah?
You both hate bullies.
It's what drives you.
Your father was a bully.
And I remember, Ellen.
I saw it.
How he treated your mom and Carrie.
And... you couldn't stop him.
You were helpless.
And that's why you're drawn to Patty, because she's not.
Ellen... if you want to keep working for Patty, go back to her.
If not, then really move on.
Stop talking to her.
Thanks, David.
I'm sorry.
For what?
I haven't been thinking about you as much as I used to.
That's good.
But I haven't forgotten.
I miss you.
It's nice to see you, Mary.
If Tessa comes through, we'll need to cross-reference the routing codes.
With a list of every bank in the U.S. I pulled it already.
And we'll need a list of charities.
I've gone through the Tobins' 1040s.
I figured I'd start with the charities they donated to regularly.
If that's how the Tobins laundered the money...
What did you think of Alex Benjamin?
She's smart, ambitious, very dedicated.
She'll fit right in.
Yes?
You were saying?
I'm glad you like her.
I didn't say I liked her.
Patty?
I'm sorry, Alex.
It's not working out.
What's not working out?
You.
I don't understand.
I think you do.
Are you firing me?
It's not personal.
Take the afternoon and clean out your office.
Malcolm?
Malcolm?
I have the document.
I thought you were gonna meet me at the bank and...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Tessa Marchetti?
Please.
No.
No.
Yes?
Your fears were well-founded, Mr. Tobin.
Ms. Marchetti came back to Antigua.
But all is well.
Mr. Tobin, are you there?
Thank you.
The money's safe.
It's not your fault, Joe.
Your father had a daughter with Danielle Marchetti.
This was his mistake.
You did it for your child.
You did it for all of us, for our f... our future.
You had no choice.
Previously on Damages.
Frobisher had my fiancé killed.
This is a tremendous book.
Let me option this.
And I want to play you.
Louis Tobin had to start moving the money down there before he confessed.
And on Thanksgiving night, Tessa started moving it out.
Patty Hewes asked you about Thanksgiving night?
I appreciated you not talking to her about it.
We are not going to approach Tessa Marchetti now.
- What are you talking about?
- We've got no leverage.
I don't need you or your protection.
I shouldn't have pushed Tessa.
I'll tell Patty.
And if she finds out, blame it on me.
Ellen Parsons.
She's been talking to Patty Hewes.
The truth is, we do believe the Tobins were involved in your mother's death.
- What should I do?
- Call this number.
This is Tessa Marchetti.
I'm just a couple blocks away from your office.
You're under arrest.
Do you know who that is?
She babysat for you and Carrie.
When we were kids, you used to tell me I was adopted.
Her name's Anne Connel.
All I could get was an address.
It's about a hundred miles out of the city.
Can I help you?
Ms Connel?
I'm sorry to bother you.
My name's Ellen Parsons.
Yes?
Do you remember me?
Ellen?
Curtis Gates arrested Tessa Marchetti.
For what?
I have no idea.
That's why she never showed up here.
So Gates just happened to arrest her right when she was coming to talk to us?
Looks like it.
How the hell would he know to do that?
I have no idea.
Why am I under arrest?
- Because of your boyfriend.
- What?
He's a citizen of Antigua.
So?
He's been living here in New York for the last three months on an expired visa.
Well, how is that my fault?
Well, he entered the country with you and he lives in your apartment.
It's a crime to house an illegal alien, Ms Marchetti.
Look, he's going to get it renewed.
I didn't do anything.
You can't arrest me for this.
Well, I'm sorry, but I can.
I want to talk to a lawyer.
Of course.
I think you should.
Any lawyer in particular?
Tessa Marchetti wants Patty Hewes to be her lawyer.
Arresting Tessa was the right move.
Yeah, I should thank you.
We would've missed this opportunity if you hadn't told me that Patty was working with Ellen behind my back.
Just doing my job.
Hey, you're not going to fire Ellen, are you?
As soon as she comes back from wherever the hell she is, send her to my office.
Thank you.
Why did you decide to find me?
I had a dream about you, actually.
Did you ever cook for me?
Many times.
So, you say you're an attorney now?
Yes.
I'm glad things worked out so well.
I was always worried about you.
Why's that?
And I was very sorry when I had to let you go.
Let me go?
What does that mean?
Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.
No.
It's okay.
I want you to tell me.
Ms Connel, were you...
This is a very strange question, but...
Was I adopted?
I'm not your mother, Ellen, if that's what you were thinking.
But I lived with you at some point?
No one ever told you?
My mother just said that you were our babysitter.
Yes, I was.
When you were four or five.
And that was all it was?
Ellen, things in your home were bad when you were young.
Bad how?
I never really knew all the details, but your father was very unhappy, very angry.
I always thought your mother should've left him, but with two small girls, she was scared to be on her own.
And she couldn't handle you and your sister.
So she sent me to you?
You were happy at my house.
Your mother knew that.
How long did it last?
You lived with me maybe six months.
And then, one day, your mother asked if I was interested
in making the arrangement permanent.
Your parents didn't adopt you.
It was the other way around.
I don't understand.
Your mother asked me to adopt you.
And what did you say?
I said yes.
I adored you.
But your mother decided she couldn't go through with it.
So, she brought you home.
And after that, she didn't want you to see me again.
I understood.
Your mother loved you, Ellen.
She did the best she could.
I talked to my client.
You have nothing on Tessa Marchetti.
You're holding her on a technicality.
So, what's your point?
I thought you didn't detain people without cause.
Yeah, well...
If I've learned one thing on this job, it's to remain flexible.
Tessa is the key to my case right now.
I need her to find the Tobins' money.
Well, she's in my custody.
Sooner or later, you're going to have to let her go.
That's true.
And you can wait for that eventuality, but I doubt you have the time.
So, why don't you just give me what I want?
Which is?
You've been working behind my back with Ellen Parsons on Danielle Marchetti's murder.
I want evidence.
I'm not ready to make a deal.
You have one message.
Hey, it's Tom.
Look, I'm sorry I screwed up, but your boss arrested Tessa Marchetti and, I don't know, the shit hit the fan.
I've never seen Patty like this.
Where are you?
Hello, Ellen.
I left messages.
Why haven't you called me back?
Leave it.
How did Gates know you were helping me on the case?
I'm sorry.
It was my fault.
Because as soon as he found out,
Gates went straight to Tessa Marchetti and arrested her.
I approached Tessa.
I thought that I could get her to cooperate, and then the whole thing blew up in my face.
It was a mistake.
A mistake?
Was it?
Or have you been trying to humiliate me this whole time?
- What?
- Pretending to help me.
When what you really wanted was to get close to Gates.
No.
You used me.
'Cause it's always been about ambition with you.
You act like you care about the case.
All that crap about your family.
Your sister's wedding.
I fell for your bullshit.
But I know you now.
I see you.
You're a climber.
A parasite.
And you're ruthless.
Just go.
I want you out of my apartment.
I want you out of my life.
May I remind you, Mr Frobisher, you're under oath.
May I remind you, Mr Frobisher, you're under oath.
Yeah, I'm well aware.
So, you considered your company sort of like a family, didn't you?
Very much like a family.
And was it your job to hold the family together?
Yes.
It was.
And you failed.
Objection.
I'm warning you, Counsel.
I'll rephrase.
Was it very painful for you when you failed?
Objection.
You keep this up, and we're gonna have ourselves a problem.
Would you agree the crumbling of that relationship was nothing less than, really, say, the dissolution of a marriage?
You better watch what you say.
Is that your position?
Or was the failure of that relationship, as you call it, your failure?
Your deceit, your breach of trust, your absolute infidelity to your employees?
I admire you, Ms Hewes, I really do.
But we're very different.
Is that so?
You've made a career out of crushing people who stand in your way.
And whereas you seek to destroy, I seek to create.
I've always felt it was my duty to inspire the people who work for me.
So that together, together,
we can build something remarkable.
What did you think?
It is such a huge help to hear this thing out loud.
We're still, you know, doing some fine-tuning,
- but it's reading great.
- Something's wrong.
Arthur, do you not think the script's working?
There's something off, you know?
Something's missing.
I don't know what the protocol is.
Can I...
By all means.
Tell them whatever you want.
Listen...
Hey, that was great, by the way.
Now, listen to me.
This is Patty Hewes you're playing.
The kind of woman who eats her young.
I mean, when she looks across the table at the Frobisher character, she is pure, unadulterated evil.
Okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
And you...
Jesus, it's uncanny.
It's like seeing a ghost.
I want to tell you something, though.
Ray Fiske was gay.
Okay?
Toss that in and play with it a little bit, all right?
And no makeup next time.
It's just a workshop.
Okay, let's take it from the top.
Whenever you're ready.
May I remind you, Mr Frobisher, you're under oath.
I'm well aware.
Do me a favour, will you, Toby, and grab us a couple of coffees?
You can finish your shoes later.
Tessa Marchetti's in custody.
Custody of who?
The D.A.
They got her on what charge?
It's unclear.
God!
Using a 24-year-old girl as a courier?
Was that the best idea my father could come up with?
He had to scramble, Joe.
Why didn't he have a goddamn plan?
He did.
Of course he did.
But the government surprised him, and they started to move in too quickly, and we were forced to improvise.
I brought these, Lou.
You wanted the heels fixed on your boots.
They're going to get me, Stu.
I can't hide it any more.
It's okay.
She knows about the fraud.
You met with the SEC?
Yeah.
It's only a matter of time before they put two and two together.
Jesus.
Louis, are you okay?
Do you have your pills?
Sweetheart, get me a glass of water, please?
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.
I'm going to tell my family tonight.
And then I'm going to turn myself in.
It'll be easier on the family if I just get it over with.
Are you ready on your end?
Everything's set with the charity, but...
Thanks, Dani.
Can you give us a minute?
Yeah, of course.
We've got to start making those transfers tonight.
Lou, this is happening too fast.
We don't have a courier yet.
How soon can Emanuel authorise a signatory for the account?
As soon as you need.
That's not a problem.
But who are you going to use?
I don't like doing this.
But there is someone we can trust.
He chose Tessa?
Tessa was his daughter.
Of course he trusted her.
How much does she know?
Only that she was depositing paycheques.
What about the documents she signed?
She know where the money was going?
Absolutely not.
She never knew what she was signing, so there's nothing she can tell the authorities.
And you're sure of that how?
Because your father was smart and careful.
Smart?
He got caught.
Okay?
I'm not going to let that happen to us.
Tessa was always loyal to him.
Doesn't mean she's going to be loyal to me.
Listen to what I'm telling you.
Tessa Marchetti doesn't know anything and she's on your side.
So calm down and don't get paranoid.
Arthur, Terry's ready for you.
Oh, my God.
Man, if I knew I was this good-Iooking, I would've tried a different line of work.
Actually, can you give us a minute?
- Yeah.
Everything okay?
- Yeah, I just want to talk to Art.
Sure.
Take your time.
Fantastic.
Really, really.
Just remarkable, man.
It's not working, Art.
What's not working?
Any of it.
I mean, the hair and the clothes are fine.
What's the problem then?
None of it feels authentic.
You know, it feels too on-the-surface.
I need to be able to go inside you and figure out what drives you.
That's the only way I can truly find the part.
That sounds great.
Do it.
You don't get it.
See, when we were workshopping the deposition scene...
No, but that's going to be a great goddamn scene.
Now, once we get, you know, a top-flight actress in there, elevate the whole thing.
Really.
Could be a great scene, but it's dishonest.
What do you mean by that?
Why is it dishonest?
I read the stenographer's transcription from your actual deposition.
Now, I don't know what you told the screenwriter, but you never waxed philosophical with Patty.
- You went ballistic.
- All right, but...
No, it was great!
It was terrific!
It was uncensored!
It was unfiltered!
That's what I need to get in touch with.
My anger?
Your dark side.
I need access to it.
Otherwise, this is just candy coating.
You are a complicated man.
You have an underbelly that most people never get to see.
Of course.
I have to be able to see it.
All right, all right.
Well, I'll just have to show you my underbelly then.
What is this?
What you need to arrest Carol Tobin for Danielle Marchetti's murder.
Thank you, Patty.
Give me a chance to look it over.
If it's what I need, I'll release Tessa immediately.
I don't want you to release her.
- I'm sorry?
- Not officially anyway.
I would like the Tobins to think that she's still in custody.
So what do you need from me?
I can't trust Tessa.
If Zedeck is confident she'll protect us, he must have his reasons, Joe.
I don't give a shit what Zedeck says.
Her mother is dead, okay?
The D. A.'s office is going to use that to win her over.
Your father has supported Tessa her whole life.
She has every reason to protect us...
I am responsible for this family now, Leonard.
I am responsible!
And she is not family.
Why should she be loyal to us?
She's a problem.
What do you want to do?
You've hired people before, right?
To find Carol, to have me followed...
God knows what else.
There have to be options, Len.
Tessa is in custody.
We can't even get to her.
Well, they can't hold her forever.
Joe, look at me.
I'm your attorney.
I need you to listen.
I can't let you do anything stupid.
It's not about you.
- Lf you're not willing to help me deal with it...
- I am...
If you're not willing to help me deal with it, I can understand.
Joe, I am...
I'll find somebody else who can help me.
Thank you for letting me sit in on the Tessa Marchetti meeting.
It'll be a great experience for you.
I'm going to include you more from now on.
I would love that.
When the Tobin case is over,
Tom and I are going to want someone who's ready, Alex.
Someone who could step up, take more responsibility in the firm.
I look forward to it.
That's why I came here.
You sabotaged this office.
You withheld evidence and you took it to Patty Hewes.
- Right?
- Nick told you?
Yes, Nick told me.
He has respect for his job.
I wasn't trying to undermine you.
I believed Patty would find information that would help us prosecute the Tobin family for the fraud.
So you were doing it to help me?
I was doing it to help the case.
That's all you have to say?
It's the truth.
Are you firing me?
Right now, I don't want you around here.
You're on leave indefinitely till I make my final decision.
Go home, Ellen.
We're going to get you out of here.
Thank you.
But first, we want to know the truth about Thanksgiving.
I lied to you, Ms Hewes.
I was with my mother that night.
We know.
We also know you changed your route with the airline that day.
Yeah, I made my first flight to Antigua.
Why?
Who sent you there?
Louis wants me to fly tonight?
He needs you to.
He's in trouble, Tessa.
He may go to jail.
How often does he want me to go down there?
Just once a week.
You'll deposit your paycheque and sign some documents at a bank.
Hello?
I left my pills.
Please bring them over.
Isn't your family there?
I don't care.
Leave them in the lobby.
Louis, are you sure?
Just do it, Danielle.
God damn it, just do it!
Okay.
I have to go.
Mom, you know more than you're telling me.
The documents you'll be signing will be sending money to a charity.
That's all you'll be doing.
I promise.
Take this.
Call Lenny.
Tell him to come pick these up.
No one can know that I spoke to Louis tonight.
Okay.
Trust me, baby, it's going to be okay.
Your mother said you were helping transfer money to a charity?
Yes.
Was I stupid to believe her?
No, no, the Tobins were involved with several charities.
Do you remember if your mother mentioned one by name?
I don't think so.
When you were cashing your paycheques at the Royal Antiguan Bank, you mentioned that you signed three documents.
Yeah, in order to get American currency.
Is it possible that a charity's name was on that third document?
I don't think so.
I would've seen it.
Do you have copies of that document?
No, they keep everything at the bank.
Do you remember anything about that form?
Not really.
I signed it so many times, but it was just a bunch of numbers.
Numbers and maybe some random letters.
Could be an IBAN.
What's that?
Routing codes for transferring money to an account in the US.
Tessa, how would you feel about going back down to Antigua?
Whatever you need.
What does Tessa actually know?
We're not sure.
I know that look, Lenny.
What else is wrong?
Protecting the money is the only thing that matters to Joe.
He's not thinking clearly.
What do you mean?
Tessa isn't safe.
Lou never would've wanted anything to happen to her.
You have to intervene.
How?
Tell Joe the truth.
You didn't tell him?
It's not my place, Marilyn.
You need to.
Joe needs to know Tessa is his daughter.
I'm Malcolm.
I'll be keeping an eye on you in case you have any sudden urges to contact the Tobins.
Don't worry.
I won't.
Thank you for letting Tessa out.
See what can happen when we decide to work together?
Shit.
You are good.
I'm glad you liked it.
You are a fun kid.
So, how does it feel to be me?
I could get used to that.
No.
Well, no pressure.
I just...
I just thought you were looking for the underbelly.
- Come on.
- Shit.
I'll trade you.
Now, there's something you've got to understand.
- Here, cheers.
- Cheers.
This is not just about pleasure.
- No.
- No.
No, all of this...
All of this releases me.
Matter of fact, I...
This is the spot I came to to make the biggest decisions of my life.
Who to lay off?
Screw you.
No, I mean it.
Screw you.
No, no, I...
There's a rawness that I get in touch with.
And I find clarity in that.
I find clarity in darkness.
See, this is the kind of stuff I want to know.
How dark do you get?
All right.
How far would you go to protect your money?
Your family?
What would you do if every single thing that mattered was being threatened?
Threatened how?
Someone out there.
You know, someone who could take everything.
- Shit.
- Shit.
And then, what if a man came up to you and he said,
"I can make all your problems go away.
Forever"?
- What would you have to do?
- Nothing.
Just say the word.
What could he do for you?
Anything.
Shit.
That's the dark side, my friend.
It doesn't get any darker than that.
Art...
What kind of shit are we talking about here?
What's up?
I want you to cut off any communication with Ellen.
- Why?
- Either she was sloppy or she disobeyed me.
What makes you say that?
She told me she approached Tessa.
Even after I told her not to.
That's how Gates found out about what we're trying to do.
Patty, hold on.
I let my guard down.
I should never have let her back in.
Look, whatever Ellen told you, she was covering up for me.
She didn't approach Tessa.
I did.
I'm sorry.
I was impatient and I screwed up.
The truth is, Ellen tried to salvage my mistake.
She was the one who steered Tessa back to us.
Why did you do it?
I did what I thought I had to do.
So the two of you were strategising behind my back.
And then you lied to me about it.
Yeah.
I lied to you.
Have you ever lied to me?
I've got work to do.
I made a judgement call and I took a risk.
I'm done apologising.
I'd like you to start looking for new cases.
Excellent.
Any particular area?
Bring me whatever you're most passionate about.
Maybe pharmaceutical class-actions or constitutional violations.
Alex, you can bring me whatever you want.
That's how we work here.
Okay.
- Did you tell him?
- Yes.
Joe's going to leave Tessa alone.
Are you okay?
Louis should have told Joe sooner.
He couldn't.
Joe wouldn't have been able to handle it back then.
He couldn't take care of himself, much less a child.
Well, now he knows.
- You all set?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
All right.
You'll go to the bank like it's business as usual.
Make your deposit, sign the paperwork.
And I keep the third document.
We shouldn't be seen together, so you'll leave now.
I'll be waiting for you across the street from the bank.
Get in the car, and we'll go straight to the airport.
Got it.
- You're out walking in the middle of the day.
- Work's been a bit iffy.
Suddenly got all this time on my hands.
Must be nice.
I guess.
I don't know what to do with myself.
- You went to see that woman.
- Yeah.
My babysitter.
- What were you expecting to find?
- I don't know.
I was hoping...
- Hoping what?
- I'm not sure.
It was stupid.
You know, you've always been trying to rewrite your family history.
What do you mean?
Well, you started by being the good girl who never got in trouble, then the perfect student.
Now the successful attorney.
I finally figured out you and Patty.
Yeah?
You both hate bullies.
It's what drives you.
Your father was a bully.
And I remember, Ellen.
I saw it.
How he treated your mom and Carrie.
And you couldn't stop him.
You were helpless.
And that's why you're drawn to Patty, because she's not.
Ellen, if you want to keep working for Patty, go back to her.
If not, then really move on.
Stop talking to her.
Thanks, David.
I'm sorry.
For what?
I haven't been thinking about you as much as I used to.
That's good.
But I haven't forgotten.
I miss you.
It's nice to see you, Mary.
If Tessa comes through, we'll need to cross-reference the routing codes.
With a list of every bank in the US.
I pulled it already.
And we'll need a list of charities.
I've gone through the Tobins' 1040s.
I figured I'd start with the charities they donated to regularly.
If that's how the Tobins laundered the money...
What did you think of Alex Benjamin?
She's smart, ambitious, very dedicated.
She'll fit right in.
Yes?
You were saying?
- I'm glad you like her.
- I didn't say I liked her.
Patty?
I'm sorry, Alex.
It's not working out.
What's not working out?
You.
I don't understand.
I think you do.
Are you firing me?
It's not personal.
Take the afternoon and clean out your office.
Malcolm?
Malcolm?
I have the document.
I thought you were gonna meet me at the bank and...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Tessa Marchetti?
Please.
No.
No.
Yes?
Your fears were well-founded, Mr Tobin.
Ms Marchetti came back to Antigua.
But all is well.
Mr Tobin, are you there?
Thank you.
The money's safe.
It's not your fault, Joe.
Your father had a daughter with Danielle Marchetti.
This was his mistake.
You did it for your child.
You did it for all of us, for our...
For our future.
You had no choice.
Previously on Damages.
Frobisher had my fiance killed.
This is a tremendous book.
Let me option this.
And I want to play you.
Louis Tobin had to start moving the money down there before he confessed.
And on Thanksgiving night, Tessa started moving it out.
Patty Hewes asked you about Thanksgiving night?
I appreciated you not talking to her about it.
We are not going to approach Tessa Marchetti now.
- What are you talking about?
- We've got no leverage.
I don't need you or your protection.
I shouldn't have pushed Tessa.
I'll tell Patty.
And if she finds out, blame it on me.
Ellen Parsons.
She's been talking to Patty Hewes.
The truth is, we do believe the Tobins were involved in your mother's death.
- What should I do?
- Call this number.
This is Tessa Marchetti.
I'm just a couple blocks away from your office.
You're under arrest.
Do you know who that is?
She babysat for you and Carrie.
When we were kids, you used to tell me I was adopted.
Her name's Anne Connel.
All I could get was an address.
It's about a hundred miles out of the city.
Can I help you?
Ms Connel?
I'm sorry to bother you.
My name's Ellen Parsons.
Yes?
Do you remember me?
Ellen?
Curtis Gates arrested Tessa Marchetti.
For what?
I have no idea.
That's why she never showed up here.
So Gates just happened to arrest her right when she was coming to talk to us?
Looks like it.
How the hell would he know to do that?
I have no idea.
Why am I under arrest?
- Because of your boyfriend.
- What?
He's a citizen of Antigua.
So?
He's been living here in New York for the last three months on an expired visa.
Well, how is that my fault?
Well, he entered the country with you and he lives in your apartment.
It's a crime to house an illegal alien, Ms Marchetti.
Look, he's going to get it renewed.
I didn't do anything.
You can't arrest me for this.
Well, I'm sorry, but I can.
I want to talk to a lawyer.
Of course.
I think you should.
Any lawyer in particular?
Tessa Marchetti wants Patty Hewes to be her lawyer.
Arresting Tessa was the right move.
Yeah, I should thank you.
We would've missed this opportunity if you hadn't told me that Patty was working with Ellen behind my back.
Just doing my job.
Hey, you're not going to fire Ellen, are you?
As soon as she comes back from wherever the hell she is, send her to my office.
Thank you.
Why did you decide to find me?
I had a dream about you, actually.
Did you ever cook for me?
Many times.
So, you say you're an attorney now?
Yes.
I'm glad things worked out so well.
I was always worried about you.
Why's that?
And I was very sorry when I had to let you go.
Let me go?
What does that mean?
Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.
No.
It's okay.
I want you to tell me.
Ms Connel, were you...
This is a very strange question, but...
Was I adopted?
I'm not your mother, Ellen, if that's what you were thinking.
But I lived with you at some point?
No one ever told you?
My mother just said that you were our babysitter.
Yes, I was.
When you were four or five.
And that was all it was?
Ellen, things in your home were bad when you were young.
Bad how?
I never really knew all the details, but your father was very unhappy, very angry.
I always thought your mother should've left him, but with two small girls, she was scared to be on her own.
And she couldn't handle you and your sister.
So she sent me to you?
You were happy at my house.
Your mother knew that.
How long did it last?
You lived with me maybe six months.
And then, one day, your mother asked if I was interested
in making the arrangement permanent.
Your parents didn't adopt you.
It was the other way around.
I don't understand.
Your mother asked me to adopt you.
And what did you say?
I said yes.
I adored you.
But your mother decided she couldn't go through with it.
So, she brought you home.
And after that, she didn't want you to see me again.
I understood.
Your mother loved you, Ellen.
She did the best she could.
I talked to my client.
You have nothing on Tessa Marchetti.
You're holding her on a technicality.
So, what's your point?
I thought you didn't detain people without cause.
Yeah, well...
If I've learned one thing on this job, it's to remain flexible.
Tessa is the key to my case right now.
I need her to find the Tobins' money.
Well, she's in my custody.
Sooner or later, you're going to have to let her go.
That's true.
And you can wait for that eventuality, but I doubt you have the time.
So, why don't you just give me what I want?
Which is?
You've been working behind my back with Ellen Parsons on Danielle Marchetti's murder.
I want evidence.
I'm not ready to make a deal.
You have one message.
Hey, it's Tom.
Look, I'm sorry I screwed up, but your boss arrested Tessa Marchetti and, I don't know, the shit hit the fan.
I've never seen Patty like this.
Where are you?
Hello, Ellen.
I left messages.
Why haven't you called me back?
Leave it.
How did Gates know you were helping me on the case?
I'm sorry.
It was my fault.
Because as soon as he found out,
Gates went straight to Tessa Marchetti and arrested her.
I approached Tessa.
I thought that I could get her to cooperate, and then the whole thing blew up in my face.
It was a mistake.
A mistake?
Was it?
Or have you been trying to humiliate me this whole time?
- What?
- Pretending to help me.
When what you really wanted was to get close to Gates.
No.
You used me.
'Cause it's always been about ambition with you.
You act like you care about the case.
All that crap about your family.
Your sister's wedding.
I fell for your bullshit.
But I know you now.
I see you.
You're a climber.
A parasite.
And you're ruthless.
Just go.
I want you out of my apartment.
I want you out of my life.
May I remind you, Mr Frobisher, you're under oath.
May I remind you, Mr Frobisher, you're under oath.
Yeah, I'm well aware.
So, you considered your company sort of like a family, didn't you?
Very much like a family.
And was it your job to hold the family together?
Yes.
It was.
And you failed.
Objection.
I'm warning you, Counsel.
I'll rephrase.
Was it very painful for you when you failed?
Objection.
You keep this up, and we're gonna have ourselves a problem.
Would you agree the crumbling of that relationship was nothing less than, really, say, the dissolution of a marriage?
You better watch what you say.
Is that your position?
Or was the failure of that relationship, as you call it, your failure?
Your deceit, your breach of trust, your absolute infidelity to your employees?
I admire you, Ms Hewes, I really do.
But we're very different.
Is that so?
You've made a career out of crushing people who stand in your way.
And whereas you seek to destroy, I seek to create.
I've always felt it was my duty to inspire the people who work for me.
So that together, together,
we can build something remarkable.
What did you think?
It is such a huge help to hear this thing out loud.
We're still, you know, doing some fine-tuning,
- but it's reading great.
- Something's wrong.
Arthur, do you not think the script's working?
There's something off, you know?
Something's missing.
I don't know what the protocol is.
Can I...
By all means.
Tell them whatever you want.
Listen...
Hey, that was great, by the way.
Now, listen to me.
This is Patty Hewes you're playing.
The kind of woman who eats her young.
I mean, when she looks across the table at the Frobisher character, she is pure, unadulterated evil.
Okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
And you...
Jesus, it's uncanny.
It's like seeing a ghost.
I want to tell you something, though.
Ray Fiske was gay.
Okay?
Toss that in and play with it a little bit, all right?
And no makeup next time.
It's just a workshop.
Okay, let's take it from the top.
Whenever you're ready.
May I remind you, Mr Frobisher, you're under oath.
I'm well aware.
Do me a favour, will you, Toby, and grab us a couple of coffees?
You can finish your shoes later.
Tessa Marchetti's in custody.
Custody of who?
The D.A.
They got her on what charge?
It's unclear.
God!
Using a 24-year-old girl as a courier?
Was that the best idea my father could come up with?
He had to scramble, Joe.
Why didn't he have a goddamn plan?
He did.
Of course he did.
But the government surprised him, and they started to move in too quickly, and we were forced to improvise.
I brought these, Lou.
You wanted the heels fixed on your boots.
They're going to get me, Stu.
I can't hide it any more.
It's okay.
She knows about the fraud.
You met with the SEC?
Yeah.
It's only a matter of time before they put two and two together.
Jesus.
Louis, are you okay?
Do you have your pills?
Sweetheart, get me a glass of water, please?
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.
I'm going to tell my family tonight.
And then I'm going to turn myself in.
It'll be easier on the family if I just get it over with.
Are you ready on your end?
Everything's set with the charity, but...
Thanks, Dani.
Can you give us a minute?
Yeah, of course.
We've got to start making those transfers tonight.
Lou, this is happening too fast.
We don't have a courier yet.
How soon can Emanuel authorise a signatory for the account?
As soon as you need.
That's not a problem.
But who are you going to use?
I don't like doing this.
But there is someone we can trust.
He chose Tessa?
Tessa was his daughter.
Of course he trusted her.
How much does she know?
Only that she was depositing paycheques.
What about the documents she signed?
She know where the money was going?
Absolutely not.
She never knew what she was signing, so there's nothing she can tell the authorities.
And you're sure of that how?
Because your father was smart and careful.
Smart?
He got caught.
Okay?
I'm not going to let that happen to us.
Tessa was always loyal to him.
Doesn't mean she's going to be loyal to me.
Listen to what I'm telling you.
Tessa Marchetti doesn't know anything and she's on your side.
So calm down and don't get paranoid.
Arthur, Terry's ready for you.
Oh, my God.
Man, if I knew I was this good-Iooking, I would've tried a different line of work.
Actually, can you give us a minute?
- Yeah.
Everything okay?
- Yeah, I just want to talk to Art.
Sure.
Take your time.
Fantastic.
Really, really.
Just remarkable, man.
It's not working, Art.
What's not working?
Any of it.
I mean, the hair and the clothes are fine.
What's the problem then?
None of it feels authentic.
You know, it feels too on-the-surface.
I need to be able to go inside you and figure out what drives you.
That's the only way I can truly find the part.
That sounds great.
Do it.
You don't get it.
See, when we were workshopping the deposition scene...
No, but that's going to be a great goddamn scene.
Now, once we get, you know, a top-flight actress in there, elevate the whole thing.
Really.
Could be a great scene, but it's dishonest.
What do you mean by that?
Why is it dishonest?
I read the stenographer's transcription from your actual deposition.
Now, I don't know what you told the screenwriter, but you never waxed philosophical with Patty.
- You went ballistic.
- All right, but...
No, it was great!
It was terrific!
It was uncensored!
It was unfiltered!
That's what I need to get in touch with.
My anger?
Your dark side.
I need access to it.
Otherwise, this is just candy coating.
You are a complicated man.
You have an underbelly that most people never get to see.
Of course.
I have to be able to see it.
All right, all right.
Well, I'll just have to show you my underbelly then.
What is this?
What you need to arrest Carol Tobin for Danielle Marchetti's murder.
Thank you, Patty.
Give me a chance to look it over.
If it's what I need, I'll release Tessa immediately.
I don't want you to release her.
- I'm sorry?
- Not officially anyway.
I would like the Tobins to think that she's still in custody.
So what do you need from me?
I can't trust Tessa.
If Zedeck is confident she'll protect us, he must have his reasons, Joe.
I don't give a shit what Zedeck says.
Her mother is dead, okay?
The D.A.'s office is going to use that to win her over.
Your father has supported Tessa her whole life.
She has every reason to protect us...
I am responsible for this family now, Leonard.
I am responsible!
And she is not family.
Why should she be loyal to us?
She's a problem.
What do you want to do?
You've hired people before, right?
To find Carol, to have me followed...
God knows what else.
There have to be options, Len.
Tessa is in custody.
We can't even get to her.
Well, they can't hold her forever.
Joe, look at me.
I'm your attorney.
I need you to listen.
I can't let you do anything stupid.
It's not about you.
- Lf you're not willing to help me deal with it...
- I am...
If you're not willing to help me deal with it, I can understand.
Joe, I am...
I'll find somebody else who can help me.
Thank you for letting me sit in on the Tessa Marchetti meeting.
It'll be a great experience for you.
I'm going to include you more from now on.
I would love that.
When the Tobin case is over,
Tom and I are going to want someone who's ready, Alex.
Someone who could step up, take more responsibility in the firm.
I look forward to it.
That's why I came here.
You sabotaged this office.
You withheld evidence and you took it to Patty Hewes.
- Right?
- Nick told you?
Yes, Nick told me.
He has respect for his job.
I wasn't trying to undermine you.
I believed Patty would find information that would help us prosecute the Tobin family for the fraud.
So you were doing it to help me?
I was doing it to help the case.
That's all you have to say?
It's the truth.
Are you firing me?
Right now, I don't want you around here.
You're on leave indefinitely till I make my final decision.
Go home, Ellen.
We're going to get you out of here.
Thank you.
But first, we want to know the truth about Thanksgiving.
I lied to you, Ms Hewes.
I was with my mother that night.
We know.
We also know you changed your route with the airline that day.
Yeah, I made my first flight to Antigua.
Why?
Who sent you there?
Louis wants me to fly tonight?
He needs you to.
He's in trouble, Tessa.
He may go to jail.
How often does he want me to go down there?
Just once a week.
You'll deposit your paycheque and sign some documents at a bank.
Hello?
I left my pills.
Please bring them over.
Isn't your family there?
I don't care.
Leave them in the lobby.
Louis, are you sure?
Just do it, Danielle.
God damn it, just do it!
Okay.
I have to go.
Mom, you know more than you're telling me.
The documents you'll be signing will be sending money to a charity.
That's all you'll be doing.
I promise.
Take this.
Call Lenny.
Tell him to come pick these up.
No one can know that I spoke to Louis tonight.
Okay.
Trust me, baby, it's going to be okay.
Your mother said you were helping transfer money to a charity?
Yes.
Was I stupid to believe her?
No, no, the Tobins were involved with several charities.
Do you remember if your mother mentioned one by name?
I don't think so.
When you were cashing your paycheques at the Royal Antiguan Bank, you mentioned that you signed three documents.
Yeah, in order to get American currency.
Is it possible that a charity's name was on that third document?
I don't think so.
I would've seen it.
Do you have copies of that document?
No, they keep everything at the bank.
Do you remember anything about that form?
Not really.
I signed it so many times, but it was just a bunch of numbers.
Numbers and maybe some random letters.
Could be an IBAN.
What's that?
Routing codes for transferring money to an account in the US.
Tessa, how would you feel about going back down to Antigua?
Whatever you need.
What does Tessa actually know?
We're not sure.
I know that look, Lenny.
What else is wrong?
Protecting the money is the only thing that matters to Joe.
He's not thinking clearly.
What do you mean?
Tessa isn't safe.
Lou never would've wanted anything to happen to her.
You have to intervene.
How?
Tell Joe the truth.
You didn't tell him?
It's not my place, Marilyn.
You need to.
Joe needs to know Tessa is his daughter.
I'm Malcolm.
I'll be keeping an eye on you in case you have any sudden urges to contact the Tobins.
Don't worry.
I won't.
Thank you for letting Tessa out.
See what can happen when we decide to work together?
Shit.
You are good.
I'm glad you liked it.
You are a fun kid.
So, how does it feel to be me?
I could get used to that.
No.
Well, no pressure.
I just...
I just thought you were looking for the underbelly.
- Come on.
- Shit.
I'll trade you.
Now, there's something you've got to understand.
- Here, cheers.
- Cheers.
This is not just about pleasure.
- No.
- No.
No, all of this...
All of this releases me.
Matter of fact, I...
This is the spot I came to to make the biggest decisions of my life.
Who to lay off?
Screw you.
No, I mean it.
Screw you.
No, no, I...
There's a rawness that I get in touch with.
And I find clarity in that.
I find clarity in darkness.
See, this is the kind of stuff I want to know.
How dark do you get?
All right.
How far would you go to protect your money?
Your family?
What would you do if every single thing that mattered was being threatened?
Threatened how?
Someone out there.
You know, someone who could take everything.
- Shit.
- Shit.
And then, what if a man came up to you and he said,
"I can make all your problems go away.
Forever"?
- What would you have to do?
- Nothing.
Just say the word.
What could he do for you?
Anything.
Shit.
That's the dark side, my friend.
It doesn't get any darker than that.
Art...
What kind of shit are we talking about here?
What's up?
I want you to cut off any communication with Ellen.
- Why?
- Either she was sloppy or she disobeyed me.
What makes you say that?
She told me she approached Tessa.
Even after I told her not to.
That's how Gates found out about what we're trying to do.
Patty, hold on.
I let my guard down.
I should never have let her back in.
Look, whatever Ellen told you, she was covering up for me.
She didn't approach Tessa.
I did.
I'm sorry.
I was impatient and I screwed up.
The truth is, Ellen tried to salvage my mistake.
She was the one who steered Tessa back to us.
Why did you do it?
I did what I thought I had to do.
So the two of you were strategising behind my back.
And then you lied to me about it.
Yeah.
I lied to you.
Have you ever lied to me?
I've got work to do.
I made a judgement call and I took a risk.
I'm done apologising.
I'd like you to start looking for new cases.
Excellent.
Any particular area?
Bring me whatever you're most passionate about.
Maybe pharmaceutical class-actions or constitutional violations.
Alex, you can bring me whatever you want.
That's how we work here.
Okay.
- Did you tell him?
- Yes.
Joe's going to leave Tessa alone.
Are you okay?
Louis should have told Joe sooner.
He couldn't.
Joe wouldn't have been able to handle it back then.
He couldn't take care of himself, much less a child.
Well, now he knows.
- You all set?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
All right.
You'll go to the bank like it's business as usual.
Make your deposit, sign the paperwork.
And I keep the third document.
We shouldn't be seen together, so you'll leave now.
I'll be waiting for you across the street from the bank.
Get in the car, and we'll go straight to the airport.
Got it.
- You're out walking in the middle of the day.
- Work's been a bit iffy.
Suddenly got all this time on my hands.
Must be nice.
I guess.
I don't know what to do with myself.
- You went to see that woman.
- Yeah.
My babysitter.
- What were you expecting to find?
- I don't know.
I was hoping...
- Hoping what?
- I'm not sure.
It was stupid.
You know, you've always been trying to rewrite your family history.
What do you mean?
Well, you started by being the good girl who never got in trouble, then the perfect student.
Now the successful attorney.
I finally figured out you and Patty.
Yeah?
You both hate bullies.
It's what drives you.
Your father was a bully.
And I remember, Ellen.
I saw it.
How he treated your mom and Carrie.
And you couldn't stop him.
You were helpless.
And that's why you're drawn to Patty, because she's not.
Ellen, if you want to keep working for Patty, go back to her.
If not, then really move on.
Stop talking to her.
Thanks, David.
I'm sorry.
For what?
I haven't been thinking about you as much as I used to.
That's good.
But I haven't forgotten.
I miss you.
It's nice to see you, Mary.
If Tessa comes through, we'll need to cross-reference the routing codes.
With a list of every bank in the US.
I pulled it already.
And we'll need a list of charities.
I've gone through the Tobins' 1040s.
I figured I'd start with the charities they donated to regularly.
If that's how the Tobins laundered the money...
What did you think of Alex Benjamin?
She's smart, ambitious, very dedicated.
She'll fit right in.
Yes?
You were saying?
- I'm glad you like her.
- I didn't say I liked her.
Patty?
I'm sorry, Alex.
It's not working out.
What's not working out?
You.
I don't understand.
I think you do.
Are you firing me?
It's not personal.
Take the afternoon and clean out your office.
Malcolm?
Malcolm?
I have the document.
I thought you were gonna meet me at the bank and...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Tessa Marchetti?
Please.
No.
No.
Yes?
Your fears were well-founded, Mr Tobin.
Ms Marchetti came back to Antigua.
But all is well.
Mr Tobin, are you there?
Thank you.
The money's safe.
It's not your fault, Joe.
Your father had a daughter with Danielle Marchetti.
This was his mistake.
You did it for your child.
You did it for all of us, for our...
For our future.
You had no choice.
Previously on "Damages"...
Frobisher had my fiancé killed.
This is a tremendous book.
Let me option this, and I want to play you.
Louis Tobin had to start moving the money down there before he confessed.
And on Thanksgiving night, Tessa started moving it out.
Patty Hewes asked you about Thanksgiving night?
I appreciated you not talking to her about it.
We are not going to approach Tessa Marchetti now.
What are you talking about?
We've got no leverage.
I don't need you or your protection.
I shouldn't have approached Tessa.
I'll tell Patty.
And if she finds out, blame it on me.
Ellen Parsons, she's been talking to Patty Hewes.
The truth is, we do believe the Tobins were involved in your mother's death.
What should I do?
Call this number.
This is Tessa Marchetti.
I'm just a couple blocks away from your office.
You're under arrest.
Do you know who that is?
She babysat for you and Carrie.
When we were kids, you used to tell me I was adopted.
Her name's Anne Connel.
All I could get was an address.
It's about a hundred miles outside of the city.
Can I help you?
Ms. Connel?
I'm sorry to bother you, um... my name's Ellen Parsons.
Yes?
Do you remember me?
Ellen?
Curtis Gates arrested Tessa Marchetti.
For what?
I have no idea.
That's why she never showed up here.
So Gates just happened to arrest her right when she was coming to talk to us?
Looks like it.
How the hell would he know to do that?
I have no idea.
Why am I under arrest?
Because of your boyfriend.
What?
He's a citizen of Antigua.
So?
He's been living here in New York for the last three months on an expired visa.
Well, how is that my fault?
Well, he entered the country with you and he lives in your apartment.
It's a crime to house an illegal alien, Ms. Marchetti.
Look, he's going to get it renewed.
I didn't do anything.
You can't arrest me for this.
Well, I'm sorry, but I can.
I want to talk to a lawyer.
Of course.
I think you should.
Any lawyer in particular?
Tessa Marchetti wants Patty Hewes to be her lawyer.
Arresting Tessa was the right move.
Yeah, I should thank you.
We would've missed this opportunity if you hadn't told me that Patty was working with Ellen behind my back.
Just doing my job.
Hey... you're not going to fire Ellen, are you?
As soon as she comes back from wherever the hell she is, send her to my office.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Why did you decide to find me?
I had a dream about you, actually.
Um, did you ever cook for me?
Many times.
So, you say you're an attorney now?
Yes.
I'm glad things worked out so well.
I was always worried about you.
Why's that?
And I was very sorry when I had to let you go.
Let me go?
What... what... what does that mean?
Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.
No.
It's okay.
I...
I...
I want you to tell me.
Ms. Connel, were you...?
This is a very strange question, but, um... was I adopted?
I'm not your mother, Ellen, if that's what you were thinking.
But I did...
I lived with you at some point?
Oh, dear.
No one ever told you?
My mother just said that you were our babysitter.
Yes, I was.
When you were four or five.
And that was all it was?
Ellen, things in your home were bad when you were young.
Bad how?
I never really knew all the details, but your father was very unhappy, very angry.
I always thought your mother should've left him, but with two small girls, she was scared to be on her own.
She couldn't handle you and your sister.
So she... sent me to you?
You were happy at my house.
Your mother knew that.
Uh, how long did it last?
You lived with me maybe six months.
And then, one day your mother asked... if I was interested...
In making the arrangement permanent.
Your parents didn't adopt you.
It was the other way around.
I don't understand.
Your mother asked me to adopt you.
And what did you say?
I said "yes."
I adored you.
But your mother decided she couldn't go through with it.
So, she brought you home.
And after that, she didn't want you to see me again.
I understood.
Your mother loved you, Ellen.
She did the best she could.
I talked to my client.
You have nothing on Tessa Marchetti.
You're holding her on a technicality.
So, what's your point?
I thought you didn't detain people without cause.
Yeah, well...
If I've learned one thing on this job, it's to remain flexible.
Tessa is the key to my case right now.
I need her to find the Tobins' money.
Uh-huh, well, she's in my custody.
Sooner or later you're going to have to let her go.
That's true.
And you can wait for that eventuality, but I doubt you have the time.
So, why don't you just give me what I want?
Which is?
You've been working behind my back with Ellen
Parsons on Danielle Marchetti's murder.
I want evidence.
I'm not ready to make a deal.
Hey, it's Tom.
Look, I'm sorry I screwed up, but your boss arrested Tessa
Marchetti and the shit hit the fan.
I've never seen Patty like this.
Where are you?
Hello, Ellen.
I left messages.
Why haven't you called me back?
Leave it.
How did Gates know you were helping me on the case?
I'm sorry.
It was my fault.
Because as soon as he found out...
Gates went straight to Tessa
Marchetti and arrested her.
I approached Tessa.
I thought that I could get her to cooperate, and then the whole thing blew up in my face.
It was a mistake.
A mistake?
Was it?
Or have you been trying to humiliate me this whole time?
What?
Pretending to help me.
When what you really wanted was to get close to Gates.
No.
You used me.
'Cause it's always been about ambition with you.
You act like you care about the case.
All that... crap... about your family.
Your sister's wedding.
I fell for your bullshit.
But I know you now.
I see you.
You're a climber.
A parasite.
And you're ruthless.
Just... go.
I want you out of my apartment.
I want you out of my life.
May I remind you, Mr. Frobisher, you're under oath.
Yeah, I'm well aware.
So, you considered your company sort of like a family, didn't you?
Very much like a family.
And was it your job to hold the family together?
Yes.
It was.
And you failed.
Objection.
I'm warning you, counsel.
I'll rephrase.
Was it very painful for you when you failed?
Objection.
You keep this up and we're going to have ourselves a problem.
Would you agree the crumbling of that relationship was nothing less than, really say, the dissolution of a marriage?
You better watch what you say.
Is that your position?
Or was the failure of that relationship, as you call it, your failure?
Your deceit, your breach of trust, your absolute infidelity to your employees?
I admire you, Ms. Hewes, I really do.
But we're very different.
Is that so?
You've made a career out of crushing people who stand in your way.
And whereas you seek to destroy, I seek to create.
I've always felt it was my duty to inspire the people who work for me.
So that together... together... we can build something remarkable.
What did you think?
It is such a huge help to hear this thing out loud.
We're still, you know, doing some fine-tuning, but it's...
Something's wrong.
Reading great.
Arthur, do you, um, do you not think the script's working?
There's something off, you know?
Something's missing.
Yeah?
I don't know the protocol.
Can I...?
Oh, by all means.
Tell them whatever you want.
Listen...
Hey, that was great, by the way.
Now, listen to m this is Patty Hewes you're playing.
The kind of woman who eats her young.
I mean, when she looks across the table at the Frobisher character...
She is pure, unadulterated evil.
Okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
And you...
Jesus, it's uncanny.
It's like... it's like seeing a ghost.
I want to tell you something though.
Ray Fiske was gay.
Oki?
Toss that in and play with it a little bit, all right?
And no makeup next time.
It's just a workshop.
Okay, uh...
I can't tell you how sexy you are.
Let's take it from the top.
Whenever you're ready.
May I remind you, Mr. Frobisher, you're under oath.
I'm well aware.
Do me a favor, will you, Toby, and grab us a couple of coffees?
You can finish the shoes later.
Tessa Marchetti's in custody.
Custody of who?
The D.A.
They got her on what charge?
It's unclear.
God!
Using a 24-year-old girl as a courier?
Was that the best idea my father could come up with?
He had to scramble, Joe.
Why didn't he have a goddamn plan?
He did.
Of course he did.
But the government surprised him and they started to move in too quickly, and...
We were forced to improvise.
I brought these, Lou.
You wanted the heels fixed on your boots.
They're going to get me, Stu.
I can't hide it anymore.
It's okay.
She knows about the fraud.
You met with the sec?
Yeah.
It's only a matter of time before they put two and two together.
Jesus.
Louis, are you okay?
Do you have your pills?
Sweetheart, get me a glass of water, please?
Okay.
Yes.
I'm going to tell my family tonight.
And then I'm going to turn myself in.
It'll be easier on the family if I just... get it over with.
Are you ready on your end?
Everything's set with the charity, but...
Here you go.
Thanks, Dani.
Give us a minute.
Yeah, of course.
We've got to start making those transfers tonight.
Lou, this is happening too fast.
We don't have a courier yet.
How soon can Emanuel authorize a signatory for the account?
As soon as you need.
That's not a problem.
But who are you going to use?
I don't like doing this.
But there is someone we can trust.
He chose Tessa?
Tessa was his daughter.
Of course he trusted her.
How much does she know?
Only that she was depositing paychecks.
What about the documents she signed?
She know where the money was going?
Absolutely not.
She never knew what she was signing.
So there's nothing she can tell the authorities.
And you're sure of that, how?
Because your father was smart and careful.
Smart?
He got caught.
Okay?
I'm not going to let that happen to us.
Tessa was always loyal to him.
Doesn't mean she's going to be loyal to me.
Listen to what I'm telling you.
Tessa Marchetti doesn't know anything and she's on your side.
So calm down and don't get paranoid.
Four?
- Four people... in the corner...
- Arthur, Terry's ready for you.
Oh, my God.
Man, if I knew I was this good-looking, I would've tried a different line of work.
Actually, can you give us a minute?
Yeah, everything okay?
Yeah, I just want to talk to Art.
Sure.
Take your time.
Fantastic.
Really, really.
Just remarkable, man.
It's not working, Art.
What... what's not working?
Any of it.
I mean, the hair and the clothes are fine.
What's the problem then?
None of it feels authentic.
You know, it feels too on the surface.
I need to be able to go inside you and figure out what drives you.
That's the only way I can truly find the part.
That sounds great.
Do it.
No, you don't get it.
See, when we were workshopping the depositions...
No, but that's going to be a great goddamn scene.
Now, once we get a, you know, a top-flight actress in there... elevate the whole thing.
Really.
Could be a great scene... but it's dishonest.
What do you mean by that?
Why... why is it dishonest?
I read the stenographer's transcription from your actual deposition.
Now, I don't know what you told the screenwriter, but you never waxed philosophical with Patty.
You went ballistic.
- All right, but...
- No, it was great!
It was terrific!
It was uncensored!
It was unfiltered!
That's what I need to get in touch with.
My anger?
Your dark side.
I need access to it.
Otherwise, this is just candy coating.
You are a complicated man.
You have an underbelly that most people never get to see.
Of course.
I have to be able to see it.
All right, all right.
We'll just, uh, have to show you my... my underbelly then.
What is this?
What you need to arrest Carol Tobin for Danielle.
Marchetti's murder.
Thank you, Patty.
Uh, give me a chance to look it over.
If it's what I need, I'll release Tessa immediately.
I don't want you to release her.
I'm sorry?
Not officially anyway.
I would like the Tobins to think that she's still in custody.
So what do you need from me?
We can't trust Tessa.
If Zedeck is confident she'll protect us, he must have his reasons, Joe.
I don't give a shit what Zedeck says.
Her mother is dead, okay?
The D.A.'s office is going to use that to win her over.
Your father has supported Tessa her whole life.
She has every reason to protect us...
I am responsible for this family now, Leonard.
I am responsible!
And she is not family.
Why should she be loyal to us?
She's a problem.
What should we do?
You've hired people before, right?
To find Carol, to have me followed...
God knows what else.
There have to be options, Len.
Tessa is in custody.
We can't even get to her.
Well, they can't hold her forever.
Joe, look at me.
I'm your attorney.
I need you need to listen.
I can't let you do anything stupid.
It's not about you.
If you're not willing to help me deal with it.
I am, I am...
If you're not willing to help me deal with it, I can understand.
Joe, I am...
I'll find somebody else who can help me.
Thank you for letting me sit in on the Tessa Marchetti meeting.
It'll be a great experience for you.
I'm going to include you more from now on.
I would love that.
When the Tobin case is over, Tom and I are going to want someone who's ready, Alex.
Someone who could step up, take more responsibility in the firm.
I look forward to it.
That's why I came here.
You sabotaged this office.
You withheld evidence and you took it to Patty Hewes.
Right?
Nick told you?
Yes, Nick told me.
He has respect for his job.
I wasn't trying to undermine you.
I believed Patty would find information that would help us prosecute the Tobin family for the fraud.
Oh, so you were doing it to help me?
I was doing it to help the case.
That's all you have to say?
Well, it's the truth.
Are you firing me?
Right now, I don't want you around here.
You're on leave indefinitely till I make my final decision.
Go home, Ellen.
We're going to get you out of here.
Thank you.
But first, we want to know the truth about Thanksgiving.
I lied to you, Ms. Hewes.
I was with my mother that night.
We know.
We also know you changed your route with the airline that day.
Yeah, I made my first flight to Antigua.
Why?
Who sent you there?
Louis wants me to fly tonight?
He needs you to.
He's in trouble, Tessa.
He may go to jail.
How often does he want me to go down there?
Just once a week.
You'll deposit your paycheck and sign some documents at a bank.
Hello?
I left my pills.
Please bring them over.
Isn't your family there?
I don't care.
Leave them in the lobby.
Louis, are you sure?
Just do it, Danielle.
Goddamn it, just do it!
Okay.
I have to go.
Mom, you know more than you're telling me.
The documents you'll be signing will be sending money to a charity.
That's all you'll be doing.
I promise.
Take this.
Call Lenny.
Tell him to come pick these up.
No one can know that I spoke to Louis tonight.
Trust me, baby, it's going to be okay.
Your mother said you were helping transfer money to a charity?
Yes.
Was I stupid to believe her?
No, no, the Tobins were involved with several charities.
Do you remember if your mother mentioned one by name?
I don't think so.
When you were cashing your paychecks at the
Royal Antiguan Bank, you mentioned that you signed three documents.
Yeah, in order to get American currency.
Is it possible that a charity's name was on that third document?
I don't think so.
I would've seen it.
Do you have copies of that document?
No, they keep everything at the bank.
Do you remember anything about that form?
Not really.
I signed it so many times, but it was just a bunch of numbers.
Numbers and, um, maybe some random letters.
Could be an iban.
What's that?
Routing codes for transferring money to an account in the U.S.
Tessa, how would you feel about going back down to Antigua?
Whatever you need.
What does Tessa actually know?
We're not sure.
I know that look, Lenny.
What else is wrong?
Protecting the money is the only thing that matters to Joe.
He's not thinking clearly.
What do you mean?
Tessa isn't safe.
Lou never would've wanted anything to happen to her.
You have to intervene.
How?
Tell Joe the truth.
You didn't tell him?
It's not my place, Marilyn.
You need to.
Joe needs to know Tessa is his daughter.
I'm Malcolm.
I'll be keeping an eye on you in case you have any sudden urges to contact the Tobins.
Don't worry.
I won't.
Thank you for letting Tessa out.
See what can happen when we decide to work together?
Ah, shit.
Oh, you are good.
I'm glad you liked it.
You are a fun kid.
So, how's it feel to be me?
I could get used to that.
No, hmm-mm.
Well, no pressure.
I just...
I just thought you were looking for the underbelly.
Come on.
Shit.
I'll trade you.
Now, there's something you've got to understand.
Here, cheers.
Cheers.
This is not just about pleasure.
No, huh?
No.
No, all of this... all of this releases me.
In fact, I...
This is the spot I came to to make the biggest decisions of my life.
Who to lay off?
Screw you.
No, I mean it.
Screw you.
No, no, I, uh... there's a rawness that, um, I get in touch with.
And I find clarity in that.
I find clarity in darkness.
This is the kind of stuff I want to know.
How dark do you get?
All right.
How far would you go... to protect your money?
Your family?
What would you do if every single thing that mattered was being threatened?
Threatened how?
Someone out there.
You know, someone who could take everything.
Shit.
Shit.
And then, what-what if a man came up to you and he said...
"I can make all your problems go away.
Forever"?
What would you have to do?
Nothing.
Just say the word.
What could he do for you?
Anything.
Shit.
That's the dark side, my friend.
It doesn't get any darker than that.
Art... what kind of shit are we talking about here?
What's up?
I want you to cut off any communication with Ellen.
Why?
Either she was sloppy or she disobeyed me.
What makes you say that?
She told me she approached Tessa.
Even after I told her not to.
That's how Gates found out about what we're trying to do.
Patty, h... hold on.
I let my guard down.
I should never have let her back in.
Look, uh... whatever Ellen told you, she was... covering up for me.
She didn't approach Tessa.
I did.
I'm sorry.
I was...
I was...
I was impatient, and I...
I screwed up.
The truth is, Ellen tried to salvage my mistake.
She was the one who steered Tessa back to us.
Why did you do it?
I did what I thought I had to.
So the two of you were strategizing behind my back.
And then you lied to me about it.
Yeah.
I lied to you.
Have you ever lied to me?
I've got work to do.
I made a judgment call, and I took a risk.
I'm done apologizing.
I'd like you to start looking for new cases.
Excellent.
Any particular area?
Um, bring me whatever you're most passionate about.
Uh, maybe pharmaceutical class actions or constitutional violations.
Alex, you can bring whatever you want.
That's how we work here.
Okay.
Did you tell him?
Yes.
Joe's going to leave Tessa alone.
Are you okay?
Louis should have told Joe sooner.
He couldn't.
Joe wouldn't have been able to handle it back then.
He couldn't take care of himself, much less a child.
Well, now he knows.
You all set?
Yeah, I'm ready.
All right.
You'll go to the bank like it's business as usual.
Make your deposit, sign the paperwork.
And I keep the third document.
We shouldn't be seen together, so you'll leave now.
I'll be waiting for you across the street from the bank.
Get in the car, and we'll go straight to the airport.
Got it.
You're out walking in the middle of the day.
Work's been a bit iffy.
Suddenly got all this time on my hands.
Must be nice.
I guess.
I don't know what to do with myself.
You went to see that woman.
Yeah.
My babysitter.
What were you expecting to find?
I don't know.
- I was hoping...
- Hoping what?
I'm not sure.
It was stupid.
Know, you've always been trying to rewrite your family history.
What do you mean?
Well, you started by being the good girl who never got in trouble, then the perfect student.
Now the successful attorney.
I finally figure you and Patty.
Ah?
You both hate bullies.
It's what drives you.
Your father was a bully.
And I remember, Ellen.
I saw it.
How he treated your mom and Carrie.
And you couldn't stop him.
You were helpless.
And that's why you're drawn to Patty, she's not.
But, Ellen... if you want to keep working for Patty, go back to her.
If not, then really move on.
Stop talking to her.
Thanks, David.
I'm sorry.
For what?
I haven't been thinking about you as much as I used to.
That's good.
But I haven't forgotten.
I miss you.
It's nice to see you, Mary.
If Tessa comes through, we'll need to cross-reference the routing codes.
With a list of every bank in the U.S.
I pulled it already.
And, uh, we'll need a list of charities.
I've gone through the Tobins' 1040s.
I figured I'd start with the charities they donated to regularly.
If that's how the Tobins laundered the money...
What did you think of Alex Benjamin?
She's smart, ambitious, very dedicated.
She'll fit right in.
Yes?
You were saying?
I'm glad you like her.
I didn't say I liked her.
Patty?
I'm sorry, Alex.
It's not working out.
What's not working out?
You.
I don't understand.
I think you do.
Are you firing me?
It's not personal.
Take the afternoon and clean out your office.
Malcolm?
Malcolm?
I have the document.
I thought you were gonna meet me at the bank and...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Tessa Marchetti?
Please.
No.
No.
Yes?
Emanuel your fears were well-founded, Mr. Tobin.
Ms. Marchetti came back to Antigua.
But all is well.
Mr. Tobin, are you there?
Thank you.
The money's safe.
It's not your fault, Joe.
Your father had a daughter with Danielle Marchetti.
This was his mistake.
You did it for your child.
You did it for all of us, for our f... for our f... our future.
You had no choice.
Let me tell you what people are like.
An example.
When I was five, I got something I really wanted.
The world's biggest balloon.
I thought that if I held onto it and jumped high enough, I could fly.
When I thought I'd be able to do it, the balloon slipped from my hand.
When I hear stories about people dreaming of flying with balloons, -
I remember my balloon.
The point is - that those people want to relive their childhood and be noticed - and break out of the pigeonholes people have put them into.
We've been taught to define everything.
Categorize everything.
Bad and good people, skinny and fat.
And people still do this when they're adults.
They ask themselves, where do I belong.
They need someone to tell them what's in and what's out, - who's a winner and who's a loser.
They need someone like me.

You want a challenge?
- Tell me.
Make these a hit, and I'll buy you a bottle of sparkling wine.
I want champagne.
Size 43?
Okay.
Bye.
The mostly sunny weather will continue.
In Central Finland and Lapland, we'll see cumulus clouds.
The temperatures will be chilly.
In the south, 1 5 degrees Celsius - and in Lapland, 1 0 degrees.
So put your fur coats on and hit the beach!
Assa, come take a look.
Your fur coat was so uncool.
That's you.
I'll upload this on YouTube.
Why?
- Because it's funny.
Sure.
Besides, I have a plan.
Wear your costume to the bar tonight.
- No way.
I'm staying home.
Forget the costume, we'll go for a drink.
Or two.
If I have two, I'll have more.
It's okay to stay home sometimes.
And light candles and fiddle with our balls, or what?
Let's go boozing and see if we can hit the jackpot.
Let's go to Turku.
- Why?
Why not?
What's in Turku?
- Miss Finland runners-up.
No way.
- To Forssa then.
I know.
I'll go and take a dump.
A triathlon.
The winner decides.
- So we'll go out.
If you win.
- We'll go to the bar.
- Shit.
Yes, we'll go the bar.
Fuck!
Not even close.
To the bar.
- If you win.
Watch out!
Careful with the floor.
Four.
Five.
We'll go the bar.
This is a double click.
You can't double click like that.
You double clicked!
That's a double click.
- We'll go the bar!
You're a double clicker.
Hi!
Pete, hi!
- Hi.
Yes!
Action.
Ready, steady...
Look, Kimi Raikkonen!
Asshole.
These were on me.
Should we piss into a pint?
- What?
Piss into a pint and sell it as cider to some idiot.
It'd be funny.
A pint or a half-pint?
If you think about the word karate-do, - it comes from "Karate do!" Karate can do anything.
Grab my wrist.
You need something to say and another cider.
This is beer.
- Great.
Want to buy mine for half-price?
Why?
- My friend left me this.
I have beerrexia.
And I'm on antipediotics, so I can't drink.
Are you trying to hustle me?
Hustle you?
Of course not.
I'll buy it.
This is warm.
- Really?
Oh, you're right.
And you, pull up your jeans a little higher.
Okay, grab my wrist.
- How?
The other way around.
Wow.
Please put ice in it.
Isn't that the celebrity bitch, Cheryl Lamour?
Sari Mottola.
Erotic dancer, lifestyle coach and Miss Helsinki finalist.
We're fans.
Let's go say hi.
Always.
Excuse me.
My name is Saku, and this is my friend Assa.
I admire you.
You're a real lady, and you do valuable work.
I agree.
- Are you trying fuck with us?
Yes, we're trying to fuck with you.
C'mon, calm down.
How could I fuck with a woman like that?
Look at her.
1 7 0 plus centimeters of pure self-confidence.
Thank you.
- Our pleasure.
I think it's great that a girl with average looks and brains...
Listen, I've got a point here.
...can become the top celebrity in this country.
And that's what you are, Cheryl.
You've made mediocrity an art form.
You're the celebrity wannabe of our generation.
- A cider?
Thanks.
A celebrity wannabe.
Think about it.
Let's go.
- Wait a second, dickheads.
Spearer, you think you can fool us that easy?
Spearer?
- Spearer.
Think you're going to fool us?
Say that again, and I'll beat the shit out of you.
Let's go outside.
- Anytime.
Let's go then.
- Calm down, Goldilocks.
Shut up, weather homo.
What did you say?
- Weather homo.
I didn't mention her mother!
He tripped over on top of those girls.
I didn't do anything.
Calm down, he's not worth it.
I'll go smash his face.
I'll go talk to him right now.
That idiot got his punishment.
He has to fuck that pig tonight.
That pig's drinking my piss!
- The night is young.
Let's party.
You did great.
Weather homo...
- Thanks, Pete!
Patrik, if you're not here in three minutes, don't come at all.
I knew this.
- He probably ran out of battery.
A war doesn't need one man.
What if someone calls the cops?
- We're okay.
You think they could help?
Hey!
"Flash Attack"?
Why does everything have to be in English?
Why can't it be flash attack in Finnish?
Or Flash Lightning?
But I like your style.
Are you going to help or not?
What is it about?
- It doesn't matter.
Are you in or out?
- We're always in.
Always.
Okay.
Grab an arm and a leg then.
Wait.
I need to check something.
Sorry, some other time.
Good luck!
Where is he going?
Sorry I'm late.
You forgot your beer.
Hi!
- Well, well.
Hi.
What's up, girl?
- Hi.
You don't remember me, do you?
- Of course we do.
Anna Salmi.
President of the student council.
Graduated with high honors.
We remember your striptease show - on the graduation cruise.
- I remember it fondly.
You look familiar.
Assa.
- Seppo is his name.
We were in French class together.
- German.
In medical school?
- High school.
Are you a doctor?
- Yes.
Wow.
You're a living example of beauty and brains in one body.
I mean head.
And body.
I'm a doctor too.
Whatever the case, - we have to go and refresh our memories.
Thanks, but we'll go home.
- Wait.
We'll party at the after-party.
- Genau.
Kommen sie, bitte.
Warten sie, bitte.
Don't go anywhere.
Really.
We can't go.
Citizens don't want to bother.
They've sunken into apathy.
What the fuck are they doing?
What's the name of that doctor?
- Anna Salmi.
Anna Salmi?
- She was in our year.
Why does that Saku guy look so familiar?
Remember that javelin thrower - who was supposed to win Olympic gold - but instead speared another contestant?
Vaguely.
But I know him from somewhere else.
You remember her?
- No.
Never too late to create new memories of her.
- She's mine.
Create memories of the other one.
Let's go.
Cops!
We have Kimble!
She peeked at us!
Did you see?
And she smiled.
Spin!
Don't point at me.
I don't want attention.
Oh no.
A dare.
Tell me to get naked.
Answer honestly.
Why did you leave Miia?
That's not a dare.
That's a truth.
- It's a dare.
The dare is to describe a past event - with a sentence or two.
Anna, stop.
Who is this Miia we're talking about?
My cousin, Miia Salmela.
You told her you loved her, - and she left her long-time boyfriend.
She thought you were getting engaged, - but then you, Mr. Spear Hero, dumped her with a text message - you sent from the Olympics or somewhere.
Before or after he speared that guy?
- After.
It wasn't like that.
I called her.
She didn't answer, so I left her a message.
It was a voice message, not a text message.
- I see.
Wow.
There were all kinds of things happening...
Yeah, if your "accident" is your excuse.
It was wrong.
I'm sorry.
Tell that to her.
My turn to spin.
You didn't do your dare yet.
You didn't tell us why you left her.
What does it matter?
It was ten years ago.
I thought she'd be different.
I thought she'd be fun - and live life to the fullest.
And she was, at first.
- What changed?
We got engaged.
It was half a joke, and then she changed.
She started dreaming about children and moving in together.
She dreamed about houses and dogs...
- What's wrong with that?
I don't want that.
I want to live on my terms.
I'm sure she'll be happy to hear - that you are a commitment-phobic stud.
Do you categorize people - so that it's easier to understand them?
If it makes you feel safe, great.
But you're wrong.
You're wrong.
- You're wrong.
You're childish.
- You're a child.
- C'mon.
There's a playground outside.
Go fight there.
Dare.
Okay, I'm outside.
Can you see?
I'm naked.
I can see it's a bit chilly.
Where are Saku and Rita?
- They're in Saku's room.
Saku wanted to show her his medals?
- Yeah.
Rita's fiance is in Russia "fishing." It's his bachelor party.
Their wedding is in two weeks, - so Rita is interested in other men's balls.
It might take some time then.
- That's right.
You want something?
- You have beer?
I have a brew.
- Oh, a brew.
Have you been best friends for a long time?
BULLYING
You'll find yourself an ugly wife.
- You won't find a wife.
I'm sorry.
Bullying is not worth it.
DON'T BE A BULLY
End of story.
We've been friends ever since.
You know what?
- What?
I remember you from German class.
You sat in the back.
When the teacher asked you something, you'd say "keine Ahnung. "
But you always got good grades in tests.
I know you have prejudices against Saku, and for a reason.
He's always been loyal to me.
He's a smart guy.
But he's totally unable to tolerate the daily grind.
Is this your natural color?
- What?
Or did you used to be a blond?
- Yeah, in high school.
Were you on that graduation cruise - where we had the radio host?
- Yeah.
I was too!
- You want to talk or fuck?
Yeah, yeah.
Damn...
You're hopeless.
Two 30-year-old guys...
- Two nice-looking guys.
Okay.
Two nice-looking guys, - who take care of their hygiene, - share an apartment, travel and party.
Neither one of you has a girlfriend.
And one of you is a weather guy.
You can't fool me.
Okay, I'll admit it.
We're a couple...
A couple of guys who want to have fun and enjoy life.
When do you enjoy life the most?
Now would be a good time to leave.
Come.
Let's go.
Bye!
So, are you glad we went out last night?
Sure.
Did Miss Moralist give you some?
She did.
We had a nice conversation.
- That's it?
We talked.
That might be a good thing.
She reminds me of Miia.
She just wants to have children and get married.
- Oh.
How do you know I don't want the same?
You don't want that.
She said she often has breakfast at Cafe Ekberg.
Go take a shower.
We have plenty of stuff to do.
What?
Viral marketing.
Go take a shower.
Miss Moralist!
Breakfast at Ekberg's.
"Anna Salmi.
What a coincidence!"
I love the way you looked for me.
Who else would've sat at Cafe Ekberg for a month?
- That's scary.
I would've sat there for a year.
- That's even scarier.
Are these too thick?
I fucking love you.
Really?
- Really.
I fucking love you.
This is Assa.
Talk to me!
Take your head out of her pussy, stupid!
I've got invitations to the new club.
Call me!
Arja, this has been viewed over 30,000 times.
You hear me?
The weather is gentle, so be gentle to your sweethearts.
Thank you.
Prepare for the news.
That was good.
Remember what we spoke about the beginning?
We could do the same thing that we do at the end.
Hey, Lance Armstrong.
Nice pants.
- Oh, hi.
What are you doing here?
I came to check that your phone is okay.
I also wanted to know you're okay.
- Sorry, Mom.
Tonight's the party.
- Yeah.
I'm not sure I can make it.
L. O. V. E...
You couldn't find a cheesier ring tone?
Hi, honey.
I'm just leaving work.
Saku came to meet me.
I'll stop when everybody believes I'm straight.
You want to see me tonight?
Oh, you're going there.
Okay.
Okey dokey, Love Bug.
I will.
I love you, too.
Bye.
Anna said hi.
Oh, you're already at that stage.
"Okey dokey, Love Bug."
Don't worry, it'll pass.
- Fuck you.
It won't.
So, are we going to the party?
Oh, you want my company now that Anna's not free?
- Exactly.
You want a ride?
Will it carry us?
- I don't know about a fatso like you.
Hey, the Beckhams of Finland.
You're the loser whose boyfriend tried to make Cheryl drink piss.
What the fuck are you doing here?
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Who did you screw to get in?
Or did someone screw you?
I'll break you.
- Gee.
You know you can't go around breaking people.
Let bygones be bygones.
Hold that.
- Okay, go ahead.
I'll break you.
- Blow yourself, closet faggot.
What are you doing?
Already fighting and the party just started.
Idiots.
- Bring my gin and tonic!
Going home?
I'm sure you'll have a nice movie night.
Let's have some fun.
I had a similar situation with Anna.
We bumped into her, but Anna kept her cool.
She's a great girl.
A last-minute flight to New York for 400 euros.
Tomorrow.
I have to work.
- Tell them you're sick.
I'll book.
- No, you won't.
Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.
I'll lend you money.
When did you become so stingy?
- I'm not stingy.
Yes, you are.
- No, you're the stingy one.
You're no fun anymore.
She's brainwashed you.
You get it?
- That's not true.
Yes, it is.
- It's not.
You only talk about Anna.
- Anna said it's not true.
You want examples?
- Shoot!
Anna and I love riding our bikes.
Anna hates Coldplay.
Anna wants me to go back to business school.
She loves my smell.
We like to chill and make love.
This is Anna's favorite wine.
And this is Dick's favorite fuckin' beer.
Okay.
But it doesn't mean that something has to change.
What has changed?
Prove it.
Come with me to New York.
Anna and I agreed that...
- I see.
We want to go to New York together.
- Fine.
I understand.
But that doesn't stop me from partying hardy tonight.
Four!
- Here you go.
I was going to say no hard liquor.
I'm going to see Anna later tonight.
Ready, steady...
- Your deodorant has failed you.
Shit.
Asshole.
- These things happen.
It's on him.
This is Anna.
I can't talk right now, so leave a message.
I'm listening to loud sex in the toilet and thinking of you.
I'll see you tonight, right?
Kiss kiss.
What is it?
I was hoping it wouldn't go this far.
But you need an intervention.
Me?
- No, not you.
I need what?
- An intervention.
See you outside.
- Hi, Mirva!
Hi!
- Get back down.
A minute or maximum two.
You have a biochemical disorder.
It's called falling in love.
I have to go home.
- You're obsessive.
It happens when you fuck one woman too many times.
You'll be back to normal in a couple of years.
But if you don't break up now, - you'll have psychological and physical problems.
I don't want to break up.
- That's because you're addicted.
Hi.
- Hello.
You need distance.
A trip around the world.
Arja.
- It's been a long time.
You look wonderful.
- So do you.
Thank you.
- Have fun.
That's it.
You break up with Anna, - and we'll take a six-month trip round the world.
But I don't want to break up with her.
- I know.
Who's the one who's nuts here?
- You.
You need medicine.
Come.
Guess who can help you?
Il Capitano!
I see a gentleman.
Who do we have here?
- Helena.
- Hi.
I'm Saku.
Lila.
- Saku.
Don't take the whole thing.
Have you ever kissed a girl?
- Yes.
I can tell you're a naughty girl.
- Maybe.
Kiss.
Show me.
- Okay, just this once.
Geez.
Whales can sing to their beloved 28 hours straight.
Think about the other whales.
They'll be like "Shut the fuck up."
"Don't sing for another second."
It would be like a song playing on the radio.
Once more.
I promise I won't ask for more.
Okay, just once.
Hi.
Where have you been?
You want to see me tonight?
I'll be there in eight minutes.
What are you doing?
Our skipper is dozing on the deck.
Assa.
Where are you?
It's me Assa.
Talk to me...
A bonfire of the vanities!
More gasoline!
Oh, hi.
- This is fucking genuine!
A bonfire of the vanities?
- Come with us!
Cops!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Fucking shit!
Those ugly color sneakers are a hit now.
Congratulations.
What do we market next?
Make tracksuits the new trend, - and I'll buy you a box of champagne.
ANNA AND ASSA'S HOUSEWARMING PARTY
Food and drinks.
Kids are welcome.
Bad news?
Make tracksuits the new trend?
I need a bigger challenge.
I know.
Sandals with socks.
Hi.
I'm here to look at the room.
You don't eat meat, do you?
Why?
- I'm a vegan.
I'll call you.
You have fiber optic cable?
- Excuse me?
How come you don't know?
Are you fifteen or something?
- I'll call you.
How would you describe yourself?
- I'm a night person.
Okay.
I'll call you.
Oh.
- Hi!
I'm here to look at the room.
Sure.
Before I let you in, - tell me how you would define yourself.
How I would define myself?
I don't believe in definitions.
You know what?
The room is yours.
- Of course.
You owe me a shirt.
- Deduct it from my rent.
In front of the Parliament House?
- That is an outstanding idea.
Maybe a couple of other places, too?
- Yes, central places.
Hola!
Greetings from Barcelona.
- Thanks.
That's okay.
Hi.
- Please go on.
Don't mind me.
You two have met, right?
Alex started the whole movement.
- Hi.
What is this Flash Attack?
A performance group?
- No.
Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
- No.
Is it or isn't it?
- It is.
I don't want to define it in any way.
- I'll define it.
There's no need to.
- I'll define it.
I'm pissed off - because people don't realize what is happening around them.
I want people to wake up and see things from a new perspective.
You don't have to live your life with blinders over your eyes.
I'll be happy to nudge people in the right direction.
There is one question I want to ask.
What will be left in the world when we die?
For me, this is about leaving a mark in history.
I want to distinguish myself from the masses.
- I see.
And now you're leaving your mark with these posters?
In a way...
If I wanted to leave a mark, I'd leave a real brand.
What do you mean?
- What would it be?
Remember the Brazilian priest who tried to fly with balloons?
Yes, he failed and died.
But he will be remembered forever.
A lot longer than this mundane crap.
This is a great idea, but take it further.
His idea is an old one.
We have a summerhouse by the sea...
Oh, hi!
What's up?
The maestro himself.
Hi!
- Nice house.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
You think I've fucking missed you?
Huh?
Saku, where are you?
I'm glad you came.
It's been a long time...
We'll talk later.
- Sure.
Where's her husband?
- He's in the garden.
He's that wealthy-looking Captain America.
I'm bored.
Let's go to my place.
Vilma's having a party.
Congratulations on your new home!
- Thanks, Miia.
Hi, Miia.
You look good.
That went well.
How are you, chief?
Really great.
- That's nice to hear.
Stay strong.
Nice seeing you.
Assa, let's get the fuck out of here.
That didn't go so well.
- Should we go?
You don't have to leave.
I promised Vilma I'd drop by at her party.
I can't leave.
Anna is enchanted by her friends' babies.
She won't notice.
I can't leave my party.
- Geez, what a doormat.
Come with me.
- I won't.
- Okay, don't come with me.
I won't!
You know where to find me.
It's unbelievable that there are guys - who think they can do whatever they want.
If I had done the same, -
I probably would've killed myself.
What are you talking about?
- Your friend.
The spearer.
You think he should've killed himself?
You know what he did to Miia.
Based on what Anna has told Miia, - he hasn't changed.
- That's right.
At least not for the better.
He should accept that he's not a star anymore.
He should grow up or die.
A great party!
- Hi.
Was your party good?
A garden swing, children, non-alcoholic punch.
Megalikes.
Eerika!
You have to get rid of your polo shirt.
Make him Japanese.
Let's destroy apathy.
Let's not accept this apathy that keeps our eyes closed.
Let's not succumb to sleep.
Let's not follow the masses.
Friends, let's aim higher.
Let's destroy apathy.
I lived like you when I first moved to Helsinki.
But I was twenty!
Twenty!
Soon I'll be thirty, and I want to move forward in life.
I don't want to be part of that lifestyle.
What do you mean?
You want to break up with me?
What do you mean?
I want a man, not a teenage boy.
- I want to be that man.
I am that man.
Okay, I won't see Saku anymore.
I don't want you to abandon your friends.
Can't you see...
Can't you...
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I don't want to live without you.
What?
I don't want to live without you.
Marry me.
Are you serious?
What?
I went to my best friend's party last night.
Did you?
In a way, he's right.
You have to do what feels right.
Destroying is easy.
Building is hard.
The idea is that we should build something surprising - that will encourage others to build something new.
Let's not accept this apathy that keeps our eyes closed.
Let's not succumb to sleep.
Let's get going!
The afterparty is downtown.
Let's move.
Oh yeah.
Assa!
My brother.
How did the rest of the party go?
- Really good.
I punched Panu.
Good.
What did Anna say?
- She threw a fit.
Really?
Don't tell me she left you.
I'm sorry.
It would be terrible if you broke up.
I proposed to her.
What?
I got down on my knees and the whole works.
- Why?
Because I love her.
Wait a minute.
You're screwing with me.
- I want you to be my best man.
Nothing will change.
I promise.
How about congratulations or something like that?
Friends usually congratulate...
That's it.
Now we'll wait for an Indian summer.
Thank you.
It's a wrap.
Indian summer.
Indian summer.
See you at the cafe.
I'll give you a feather.
Don't shake your head like that.
You're not going anywhere!
- Wonderful!
You're a naughty boy.
- Yes, I've been so naughty.
Get in and we'll go.
- Hurry up!
Ladies and not so ladylike ladies!
Lance Armstrong!
Weather homo.
Is Anna really worth all this?
- Yes.
I'm sitting there with my dick out, - drinking beer and watching porn on TV...
Chief, why don't you just shut up.
Let's change the subject.
Ladies and gentlemen, Night Club Kaivohuone.
Hi.
I know.
I'll call my friend.
His dad is someone big in Moscow.
He said I can borrow his airplane.
We'll party in Moscow.
- Sure, spearer.
You talk big, but no one has taken you seriously in years.
That's right.
My wife Rita said you're the biggest loser she's ever met.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I thought your wife was in love with me - because she begged for more sex at Assa's party.
You didn't know that I fucked your wife - in her bachelorette party?
"Oh my gosh."
"Oh my gosh."
Hold this.
Sorry, I didn't mean to hit you.
- Too bad.
Tele and Tubby started this!
Come and try again!
Come here!
Peace.
Let it go.
Assa?
I've had enough getting kicked out of bars.
This was meant to happen.
- You mean this?
You think your bachelor party is over?
Well, I've still got a couple of intact organs.
Thanks for the bachelor party.
You're welcome.
You ever think about where this train is going?
- Yes.
I think about it all the time.
Ever since that accident, -
I've asked myself if there's any sense in all this.
Does there need to be sense?
Can't we just be?
Let life guide you.
I'll ask one last time.
Please, don't do this to yourself.
Don't become a dog.
Think really hard if Anna is worth it.
Yes, she is.
No, she's not.
Shit.
I was supposed to see Saku.
- Today?
What do I tell him?
Hi.
- Where are you?
Your beer is getting cold.
I'm sorry.
Something came up...
Do you have time next week?
Do I have time?
Let me check my calendar.
I have all kinds of things, - but I think I'll be able to fit you.
I'm really sorry.
This isn't about you.
Please, do me a favor - and stop talking to me like you talk to women.
Anna is ovulating.
We're making a baby.
Anna is ovulating.
They're making a baby.
That's beautiful.
I won't bother you any longer.
Please continue.
Bye.
He didn't like that.
Assa flaked out again?
- They're trying to have a baby.
You want to take a last-minute flight somewhere?
- Okay.
Really?
Always.
A contest.
Who comes up with the yuckiest shot?
Whoever pukes first loses.
- Okay.
C. O. C. K.
Wow, this is fresh!
- You're perfect.
Let's get married.
- Oh, honey...
As much as I like you, I can't be with you.
Because I'm a man and you're a woman?
- Well, yeah.
Relationships are not for you.
You know that.
I can be in a relationship if I want to.
- Uh-huh.
I bet you won't last a month with someone.
Will you go to bed with me if I do?
- No.
Will you marry me if I do?
- Yes, I will.
I will.
You will...
You're perfect.
Excuse me.
Can you bring me a glass of water - cause I'm so hungry that I don't know - where to spend the night?
C'mon, don't be like that.
Be like this.
I'm Saku.
Can I buy you a drink?
Hi, honey.
I thought we'd go for a picnic.
You remembered our one-month anniversary.
That's why we're going for a picnic.
- You mean like, in the snow?
Yeah, like in the snow.
No, at my place.
You're sweet.
Did you have a good day?
- It was okay.
Were the customers nice?
Guess what I'd like to do next?
- What?
Like, go rent a movie.
Like, make hot chocolate and cuddle.
You know what I'd like to do next, like?
You probably want to go rent a movie.
Make hot chocolate and cuddle.
Travel to Tallinn for sushi.
My friend has a helicopter, and he owes me a flight.
I'm serious.
- That's a great idea but can't we just stay home and watch TV?
Don't be a fucking granny, okay?
What's wrong with chilling at home with your sweetheart?
Wouldn't it be cooler to chill in Tallinn with your sweetheart?
In Prague, New York or wherever.
Huh?
It would.
You get tired of champagne if you drink it all the time.
- What's that?
If everything is always so awesome, - nothing will be awesome in the end.
- What a load of shit.
Honey, look at me.
Let's go watch TV, please.
Go watch TV by yourself.
Please.
Maybe I will.
Honey bunny, don't be mad at me.
Saku is really sorry.
Teddy bear's here to cheer you up.
What the fuck is going on?
Huh?
- C'mon.
How do you dare?
If you want to cuddle, I'll find you a girlfriend.
Are you crazy?
- Yes, for letting a lesbian seduce my girlfriend.
The girlfriend you got to get me in bed.
- You're my fuckin' roommate!
Are you fuckin' blind?
I'm cleaning up your mess here!
I'll go to the bar.
Have your ass out before I get back.
I wish I had been wrong about you.
You're nothing but a co-dependent loser.
You live through other people.
Like I said, I'm going to the bar.
Have your ass out before I get back.
And her, too.
- Fuck you!
And grow up, for fuck's sake!
Hi.
- Assa, we have to meet.
How about tomorrow?
Get back to bed!
Anna, back to bed.
What did you want to say?
Nothing, actually.
Bye.
Are you in bed already?
- I'm not telling you.
What are you doing?
- I'm not telling you.
Are you hiding?
- Yes.
The problem is not that he wants that.
He doesn't know what he wants.
Remember that I want a girl.
I've known him since childhood.
I've saved him from his choices.
My friend's girlfriend ruined our friendship too.
He used to party, but now when you call him, - he'll tell you he'll stay home with his girl - and do the dishes together.
Shut up for a moment.
It's insane.
And now this insemination.
I mean, think about.
He's twenty-one and he's living like... like he's thirty.
That's right.
I don't want to go home!
We have to go.
- I wanted to stay in daycare.
I don't want to!
No, I don't want to!
Good evening.
I'll give you 1 0 euros if you beat me up.
Alcoholic.
Fuck!
I think this time we did it.
I'm serious.
- Seriously?
Who's that?
Shit.
What happened?
- Mira left me.
I'll ask him to come in.
Don't move.
- I won't.
I don't want to see him.
- We'll go out.
I'll be back at ten.
You said you wouldn't drink.
- One beer can't ruin the whole load.
Don't go.
- At eleven.
How are you?
Well, making a baby is a little harder than I thought.
We lost a baby at six weeks.
- What?
A miscarriage?
People say it's common, - but it's really tough, especially for Anna.
Anna felt she'd failed somehow.
But you lost that baby too.
Right?
It's okay if you're hurting, too.
Right?
I'll go get us another round.
- You sure?
Yes.
I need another one.
Ring the doorbell.
Stomp your feet a little.
- Why didn't you ring the bell?
Guess who's staying over?
- Hello, princess!
You stink.
We got you a burger.
It's a love burger.
Okay, I'll put it in the refrigerator.
Why didn't you answer my calls?
I called you many times.
- Calm down.
Let me see.
Oh, my volume is turned off.
Do you realize how worried I was?
You realize how worried I was?
I'm sorry.
How can I have a baby with you if I can't trust you?
Are you going to do this when I have a baby?
When you have a baby?
You, you.
Did you hear?
We're making a baby for her.
- I didn't mean that.
You should've thought about that - before you made me marry you and stopped using birth control.
You wanted that!
You proposed to me.
You stopped using birth control.
- We agreed on it.
Okay.
Let's calm down.
The damage is already done;
you're married.
What would you do, princess?
- Get the fuck out.
I'm not staying with this nag.
Fine.
Get the fuck out of here.
Both of you.
What?
- Get the fuck out of here now!
I'm not leaving my TV here.
I'm taking it with me.
Saku, take the lamp from the porch.
Take the fucking lamp from the porch.
I won't leave my TV here.
That's right.
This is how we get the fuck out of here.
Saku, let's get the fuck out of here.
This is how we do it.
Come and watch TV with us.
Let's go.
Is Assa here?
He's sleeping.
I want to talk to him now.
He's really tired.
- I need to talk to him now.
That's why you broke up.
It's just "me, me, me."
There's nothing to see here.
Seppo.
Seppo.
Honey.
This is not me.
I'm not like this.
I'm not like this.
Let's go home.
If you ever come near me, I'll kill you.
Get ready for broadcast.
Seppo, two minutes.
We have a rain front coming in from northwest.
From the southwest...
Who knows about these.
As you can see, here we have cuntolous clouds...
Cut!
Cut!
What are you waving at me for?
You're in the same boat.
Stay behind the camera or I'll tape you to it.
A MOMENT, PLEASE
Holy shit...
That's a wrap.
What happened?
How can I be in the same spot again?
Why didn't I apologize to her after all those fights?
How can I be so stupid?
Why was I so proud that I let things go this far?
Anna is the best woman I've ever met, - but we're like oil and water.
Fuck, oil and water...
Assa.
- Okay.
I had something, but I blew it.
- Stop.
That's enough of crying.
I've been listening to you whine for six months now.
It won't take you anywhere.
Stop.
Okay.
Thank you.
- Thank you, Saku.
No, thank you.
- Don't make fun of everything.
Thank you.
- Thank you if you stop.
Fuck you and your jokes.
Really, we got to go downtown.
Let's go.
Ready, steady...
Look, a moose!
Look, Jesus!
You're so dumb.
I bet you won't be able - to get a woman to take off her bra in here.
I just want to get drunk.
I'm too tired to play.
This amusement park is open and we've got access to all rides.
The night is young.
If you lose, you'll get a tattoo.
I don't know what to tattoo.
- I'll do the dishes for six months.
Deal.
Hi, Cheryl.
I've been wanting to apologize for the way we behaved last time and the time before that.
We had a difficult childhood.
- Can you leave?
I admire you.
- I'm not interested.
I'm serious.
It's great that you exist.
You make the rest of us feel superior.
Cheryl, you're a modern Jesus.
You're a heroine willing to sacrifice herself.
- Don't touch me.
I'm asking you for a small favor - after all this sucking up to you.
Will you give me your bra?
I tripped.
Haven't you ever tripped?
What?
Assa, calm down.
You calm down!
- I am calm.
Of course you are.
Why do you always provoke me?
Explain it to me.
- We're having fun.
Besides, it would've been wrong - if they hadn't kicked us out.
This is fun?
We're trying to have fun with a taste of blood in our mouths?
Why is it always me who tastes it?
Explain that to me!
Move.
Fucking move!
Are you going to move or what?
Move!
Fucking move.
Move!
Move.
Move.
Move.
Move...
Fucking move!
Fucking move!
There are people who will pick up a coin from the urinal.
Then there are people who will put the coin there - to see who'll pick it up.
Guess which you are.
Well, well.
Superlosers on the go again.
I can tell you're in top shape.
You want to see what we just did?
You should like it.
Let me guess.
Dildos made out of Barbies, buzzing around on the streets.
Let's go home.
Let's agree you won.
What was Flash Attack?
Was it a group or these attacks or something else?
Before becoming paralyzed...
- Isn't this your new best friend?
...a big dream.
He was a Brazilian priest.
He tried to break the record for flying with helium-filled balloons.
That was my idea!
What a guy!
I told him about that.
As if that wuss would ever have the courage to do that.
Would you have the courage?
His body was found...
- Would you have the courage?
But this great legend lives on.
He'll be remembered forever.
What the hell...
Assa?
What are you doing?
- I'm filling balloons.
Are you drunk?
- No.
The most sober I've been in months.
Explain.
- It's possible to break the record.
The priest would've broken it if he hadn't drifted over the ocean.
Get real.
The whole trick is an illusion.
You'll kill yourself.
- At least I will be remembered - for something other than spearing someone.
Are you with me?
Flash Patrol is calling.
Flash Patrol?
You're out of your mind.
People have definitely noticed a group called Flash Patrol.
The group will try to break the record - for flying with helium-filled balloons.
A Brazilian priest was the last person to try to break the record...
Look!
I've never seen this many balloons.
They have to be as big as possible.
- We have these.
Shelf C.
I'll jump out of the window to see if this works.
- See you.
You'll find yourself an ugly wife.
- You won't find a wife.
It almost flew.
- Let's be honest with ourselves.
This is an insane idea.
- An insanely good idea.
Neither of us has experience.
That's the point.
Dangerous and difficult.
That's what you wanted.
- Not this dangerous and difficult.
What's the worst thing that could happen?
We'll add balloons, and it'll go straight up.
This isn't that difficult.
We'll make one man fly anytime.
More helium, and he'll be airborne.
Anna.
- Fuck!
Can we talk?
Assa is in danger.
Sure, if he hangs out with you.
Move, please.
Okay, not in danger, but losing it.
You're the only one he'll listen to.
This is a long story.
I would like you to trust me.
Okay?
You want me to trust you?
Anna, I'm trying to fix things here.
- No, you're not.
You don't want to be happy, - and that's why no one else can be either.
I want to be happy.
- Why don't you stop this recklessness then?
It's not that simple.
- It's exactly that simple.
Assa realized it.
And then you came and messed his head up.
He lost his happiness and I lost mine.
So thanks a fucking lot.
I screwed up everything, but this is about Assa.
He's losing it.
Anna.
Okay, five minutes.
FLASH PATROL
Excuse me.
One question.
Why are you doing this?
Fuck.
This is senseless.
This is like trying to commit suicide.
What do I have to lose?
- You want me to list everything?
Good health.
A good job.
A good woman.
- Anna dumped me.
I lost my job.
- I'll talk to your boss.
Anna will take you back.
- Yeah, sure.
I talked to her.
Did she say she wants me back?
- Yes.
Okay, she didn't.
But she didn't say she doesn't.
I curse the day I met you.
I'm fucking stupid.
- No, you're not.
You're just a little confused.
- If she takes me back, what then?
You'll make a baby and live happily ever after.
Right?
Fuck!
There's nothing like that!
I should've believed you.
My relationships just cause tears and pain.
I'm fucking tired of crying like a girl.
I want to be a man!
Are you with me or not?
Always.
I'll do it.
No fucking way.
- My costume and my idea.
You got scared.
- No, I didn't.
You did.
- I didn't.
- You did.
We'll flip a coin.
- Heads.
Two out of three.
This is so unnecessary.
What the fuck?
Let me go.
This is for your own good.
God damn!
Assa.
You're my only and dearest friend.
Go back to Anna, okay?
You owe it to me.
- I don't owe you anything.
Soon you will.
- Did you hear what I said, dickhead?
Don't you dare go out there!
I'm sorry, - but unfortunately there will be no balloon flight today.
Why not?
- Because there's no sense in it.
Saku, I'm sure you want to use the publicity.
You'd get a lot of attention.
You'll be a hero, and not a failed javelin thrower.
I don't have the guts.
You can leave.
- Did we come here for nothing?
What do we write about now?
Saku!
I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
Just die!
That's right.
Too bad he didn't die.
Let's go.
There's nothing to see.
Yeah, yeah.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Fuck.
Undo these!
Fuck!
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
I think I should go.
Fuck!
Saku!
Assa.
Help!
Saku!
No.
No.
No.
So you took the battery.
Fuck.
Saku, I fucking hate you.
I thank the Lord every day for not getting on that thing.
People often ask me what I think happened to you.
Based on what I know about Saku, he planned it.
This was meant to happen.
Put that away.
Look!
- Shh.
I did it.
I'll go.
FOR OUR FRIENDS!

And cut!
And cut!
- And cut!
Come.
And cut.
- And peep.
Cut!
Let me tell you what people are like.
An example.
When I was five, I got something I really wanted.
The world's biggest balloon.
I thought that if I held onto it and jumped high enough, I could fly.
When I thought I'd be able to do it, the balloon slipped from my hand.
When I hear stories about people dreaming of flying with balloons,...
I remember my balloon.
The point is... that those people want to relive their childhood and be noticed... and break out of the pigeonholes people have put them into.
We've been taught to define everything.
Categorize everything.
Bad and good people, skinny and fat.
And people still do this when they're adults.
They ask themselves, where do I belong.
They need someone to tell them what's in and what's out,... who's a winner and who's a loser.
They need someone like me.

Saku.
You want a challenge?
- Tell me.
Make these a hit, and I'll buy you a bottle of sparkling wine.
I want champagne.
Size 43?
Okay.
Bye.
The mostly sunny weather will continue.
In Central Finland and Lapland, we'll see cumulus clouds.
The temperatures will be chilly.
In the south, 15 degrees Celsius... and in Lapland, 10 degrees.
So put your fur coats on and hit the beach!
Assa come take a look.
Your fur coat was so uncool.
That's you.
I'll upload this on YouTube.
Why?
- Because it's funny.
Sure.
Besides, I have a plan.
Wear your costume to the bar tonight.
- No way.
I'm staying home.
Forget the costume, we'll go for a drink.
Or two.
If I have two, I'll have more.
It's okay to stay home sometimes.
And light candles and fiddle with our balls, or what?
Let's go boozing and see if we can hit the jackpot.
Let's go to Turku.
- Why?
Why not?
What's in Turku?
- Miss Finland runners-up.
No way.
- To Forssa then.
I know.
I'll go and take a dump.
A triathlon.
The winner decides.
- So we'll go out.
If you win.
- We'll go to the bar.
- Shit.
Yes, we'll go the bar.
Fuck!
Not even close.
To the bar.
- If you win.
Watch out!
Careful with the floor.
Four.
Five.
We'll go the bar.
This is a double click.
You can't double click like that.
You double clicked!
That's a double click.
- We'll go the bar!
You're a double clicker.
Hi!
Pete, hi!
- Hi.
Yes!
Action.
Ready, steady...
Look, Kimi Raikkonen!
Asshole.
These were on me.
Should we piss into a pint?
- What?
Piss into a pint and sell it as cider to some idiot.
It'd be funny.
A pint or a half-pint?
If you think about the word karate-do,... it comes from 'Karate do!" Karate can do anything.
Grab my wrist.
You need something to say and another cider.
This is beer.
- Great.
Want to buy mine for half-price?
Why?
- My friend left me this.
I have beerrexia.
And I'm on antipediotics, so I can't drink.
Are you trying to hustle me?
Hustle you?
Of course not.
I'll buy it.
This is warm.
- Really?
Oh, you're right.
And you, pull up your jeans a little higher.
Okay, grab my wrist.
- How?
The other way around.
Wow.
Please put ice in it.
Isn't that the celebrity bitch, Cheryl Lamour?
Sari Mottola.
Erotic dancer, lifestyle coach and Miss Helsinki finalist.
We're fans.
Let's go say hi.
Always.
Excuse me.
My name is Saku, and this is my friend Assa.
I admire you.
You're a real lady, and you do valuable work.
I agree.
- Are you trying fuck with us?
Yes, we're trying to fuck with you.
C'mon, calm down.
How could I fuck with a woman like that?
Look at her.
170 plus centimeters of pure self-confidence.
Thank you.
- Our pleasure.
I think it's great that a girl with average looks and brains...
Listen, I've got a point here.
...can become the top celebrity in this country.
And that's what you are, Cheryl.
You've made mediocrity an art form.
You're the celebrity wannabe of our generation.
- A cider?
Thanks.
A celebrity wannabe.
Think about it.
Let's go.
- Wait a second, dickheads.
Spearer, you think you can fool us that easy?
Spearer?
- Spearer.
Think you're going to fool us?
Say that again, and I'll beat the shit out of you.
Let's go outside.
- Anytime.
Let's go then.
- Calm down, Goldilocks.
Shut up, weather homo.
What did you say?
- Weather homo.
I didn't mention her mother!
He tripped over on top of those girls.
I didn't do anything.
Calm down, he's not worth it.
I'll go smash his face.
I'll go talk to him right now.
That idiot got his punishment.
He has to fuck that pig tonight.
That pig's drinking my piss!
- The night is young.
Let's party.
You did great.
Weather homo...
- Thanks, Pete!
Patrik, if you're not here in three minutes, don't come at all.
I knew this.
- He probably ran out of battery.
A war doesn't need one man.
What if someone calls the cops?
- We're okay.
You think they could help?
Hey!
"Flash Attack"?
Why does everything have to be in English?
Why can't it be flash attack in Finnish?
Or Flash Lightning?
But I like your style.
Are you going to help or not?
What is it about?
- It doesn't matter.
Are you in or out?
- We're always in.
Always.
Okay.
Grab an arm and a leg then.
Wait.
I need to check something.
Sorry, some other time.
Good luck!
Where is he going?
Sorry I'm late.
You forgot your beer.
Hi!
- Well, well.
Hi.
What's up, girl?
- Hi.
You don't remember me, do you?
- Of course we do.
Anna Salmi.
President of the student council Graduated with high honors.
We remember your striptease show... on the graduation cruise.
- I remember it fondly.
You look familiar.
Assa.
- Seppo is his name.
We were in French class together.
- German.
In medical school?
- High school.
Are you a doctor?
- Yes.
Wow.
You're a living example of beauty and brains in one body.
I mean head.
And body.
I'm a doctor too.
Whatever the case,... we have to go and refresh our memories.
Thanks, but we'll go home.
- Wait.
We'll party at the after-party.
- Gena...
Kommen sie, bitte.
Warten sie, bitte.
Don't go anywhere.
Really.
We can't go.
Citizens don't want to bother.
They've sunken into apathy.
What the fuck are they doing?
What's the name of that doctor?
- Anna Salmi.
Anna Salmi?
- She was in our year.
Why does that Saku guy look so familiar?
Remember that javelin thrower... who was supposed to win Olympic gold... but instead speared another contestant?
Vaguely.
But I know him from somewhere else.
You remember her?
- No.
Never too late to create new memories of her.
- She's mine.
Create memories of the other one.
Let's go.
Cops!
We have Kimble!
She peeked at us!
Did you see?
And she smiled.
Spin!
Don't point at me.
I don't want attention.
Oh no.
A dare.
Tell me to get naked.
Answer honestly.
Why did you leave Miia?
That's not a dare.
That's a truth.
- It's a dare.
The dare is to describe a past event... with a sentence or two.
Anna, stop.
Who is this Miia we're talking about?
My cousin, Miia Salmela.
You told her you loved her,... and she left her long-time boyfriend.
She thought you were getting engaged,... but then you, Mr. Spear Hero, dumped her with a text message... you sent from the Olympics or somewhere.
Before or after he speared that guy?
- After.
It wasn't like that.
I called her.
She didn't answer, so I left her a message.
It was a voice message, not a text message.
- I see.
Wow.
There were all kinds of things happening...
Yeah, if your 'accident' is your excuse.
It was wrong.
I'm sorry.
Tell that to her.
My turn to spin.
You didn't do your dare yet.
You didn't tell us why you left her.
What does it matter?
It was ten years ago.
I thought she'd be different.
I thought she'd be fun... and live life to the fullest.
And she was, at first.
- What changed?
We got engaged.
It was half a joke, and then she changed.
She started dreaming about children and moving in together.
She dreamed about houses and dogs...
- What's wrong with that?
I don't want that.
I want to live on my terms.
I'm sure she'll be happy to hear... that you are a commitment-phobic stud.
Do you categorize people... so that it's easier to understand them?
If it makes you feel safe, great.
But you're wrong.
You're wrong.
- You're wrong.
You're childish.
- You're a child.
- C'mon.
There's a playground outside.
Go fight there.
Dare.
Okay, I'm outside.
Can you see?
I'm naked.
I can see it's a bit chilly.
Where are Saku and Rita?
- They're in Saku's room.
Saku wanted to show her his medals?
- Yeah.
Rita's fiancé is in Russia 'fishing.' It's his bachelor party.
Their wedding is in two weeks,... so Rita is interested in other men's balls.
It might take some time then.
- That's right.
You want something?
- You have beer?
I have a brew.
- Oh, a brew.
Have you been best friends for a longtime?
BULLYING
You'll find yourself an ugly wife.
- You won't find a wife.
I'm sorry.
Bullying is not worth it.
DON'T BE A BULLY
End of story.
We've been friends ever since.
You know what?
- What?
I remember you from German class.
You sat in the back.
When the teacher asked you something, you'd say "keine Ahnung."
But you always got good grades in tests.
I know you have prejudices against Saku, and for a reason.
He's always been loyal to me.
He's a smart guy.
But he's totally unable to tolerate the daily grind.
Ls this your natural color?
- What?
Or did you used to be a blond?
- Yeah, in high school.
Were you on that graduation cruise... where we had the radio host?
- Yeah.
I was too!
- You want to talk or fuck?
Yeah, yeah.
Damn...
You ?
e hopeless.
Two 30-year-old guys...
- Two nice-looking guys.
Okay.
Two nice-looking guys,... who take care of their hygiene,... share an apartment, travel and party.
Neither one of you has a girlfriend.
And one of you is a weather guy.
You can't fool me.
Okay, I'll admit it.
We're a couple...
A couple of guys who want to have fun and enjoy life.
When do you enjoy life the most?
Now would be a good time to leave.
Come.
Let's go.
Bye!
So, are you glad we went out last night?
Sure.
Did Miss Moralist give you some?
She did.
We had a nice conversation.
- That's it?
We talked.
That might be a good thing.
She reminds me of Miia.
She just wants to have children and get married.
- Oh.
How do you know I don't want the same?
You don't want that.
She said she often has breakfast at Café Ekberg.
Go take a shower.
We have plenty of stuff to do.
What?
Viral marketing.
Go take a shower.
Miss Moralist!
Breakfast at Ekberg's.
"Anna Salmi.
What a coincidence!"
I love the way you looked for me.
Who else would've sat at Café Ekberg for a month?
- That's scary.
I would've sat there for a year.
- That's even scarier.
Are these too thick?
I fucking love you.
Really?
- Really.
I fucking love you.
This is Assa Talk to me!
Take your head out of her pussy, stupid!
I've got invitations to the new club.
Call me!
Arja, this has been viewed over 30,000 times.
The weather is gentle, so be gentle to your sweethearts.
Thank you.
Prepare for the news.
That was good.
Remember what we spoke about the beginning?
We could do the same thing that we do at the end.
Hey, Lance Armstrong.
Nice pants.
- Oh, hi.
What are you doing here?
I came to check that your phone is okay.
I also wanted to know you're okay.
- Sorry, Mom.
Tonight's the party.
- Yeah.
I'm not sure I can make it.
L. 0.
IL E..
You couldn't find a cheesier ring tone?
Hi, honey.
I'm just leaving work.
Saku came to meet me.
I'll stop when everybody believes I'm straight.
You want to see me tonight?
Oh, you're going there.
Okay.
Okey dokey, Love Bug.
I will.
I love you, too.
Bye.
Anna said hi.
Don't worry, it'll pass.
- Fuck you.
It won't.
So, are we going to the party?
Oh, you want my company now that Anna's not free?
- Exactly.
You want a ride?
Will it carry us?
- I don't know about a fatso like you.
Hey, the Beckhams of Finland.
You're the loser whose boyfriend tried to make Cheryl drink piss.
What the fuck are you doing here?
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Who did you screw to get in?
Or did someone screw you?
I'll break you.
- Gee.
You know you can't go around breaking people.
Let bygones be bygones.
Hold that.
- Okay, go ahead.
I'll break you.
- Blow yourself, closet faggot.
What are you doing?
Already fighting and the party just started.
Idiots.
- Bring my gin and tonic!
Going home?
I'm sure you'll have a nice movie night.
Let's have some fun.
I had a similar situation with Anna.
We bumped into her, but Anna kept her cool.
She's a great girl.
A last-minute flight to New York for 400 euros.
Tomorrow.
I have to work.
- Tell them you're sick.
I'll book.
- No, you won't.
Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.
I'll lend you money.
When did you become so stingy?
- I'm not stingy.
Yes, you are.
- No, you're the stingy one.
You're no fun anymore.
She's brainwashed you.
You get it?
- That's not true.
Yes, it is.
- It's not.
You only talk about Anna.
- Anna said it's not true.
You want examples?
- Shoot!
Anna and I love riding our bikes.
Anna hates Coldplay.
Anna wants me to go back to business school.
She loves my smell.
We like to chill and make love.
This is Anna's favorite wine.
And this is Dick's favorite fuckin' beer.
Okay.
But it doesn't mean that something has to change.
What has changed?
Prove it.
Come with me to New York.
Anna and I agreed that...
- I see.
We want to go to New York together.
- Fine.
I understand.
But that doesn't stop me from partying hardy tonight.
Four!
- Here you go.
I was going to say no hard liquor.
I'm going to see Anna later tonight.
Ready, steady...
- Your deodorant has failed you.
Shit.
Asshole.
- These things happen.
It's on him.
This is Anna.
I can't talk right now so leave a message.
I'm listening to loud sex in the toilet and thinking of you.
I'll see you tonight, right?
Kiss kiss.
What is it?
I was hoping it wouldn't go this far.
But you need an intervention.
Me?
- No, not you.
I need what?
- An intervention.
See you outside.
- Hi, Mirva!
Hi!
- Get back down.
A minute or maximum two.
You have a biochemical disorder.
It's called falling in love.
I have to go home.
- You're obsessive.
It happens when you fuck one woman too many times.
You'll be back to normal in a couple of years.
But if you don't break up now,... you'll have psychological and physical problems.
I don't want to break up.
- That's because you're addicted.
Hi.
- Hello.
You need distance.
A trip around the world.
Arja.
- It's been a long time.
You look wonderful.
- So do you.
Thank you.
- Have fun.
That's it.
You break up with Anna,... and we'll take a six-month trip round the world.
But I don't want to break up with her.
- I know.
Who's the one who's nuts here?
- You.
You need medicine.
Come.
Guess who can help you?
Il Capitano!
I see a gentleman.
Who do we have here?
- Helena.
- Hi.
I'm Saku.
Lila.
- Saku.
Don't take the whole thing.
Have you ever kissed a girl?
- Yes.
I can tell you're a naughty girl.
- Maybe.
Kiss.
Show me.
- Okay, just this once.
Geez.
Whales can sing to their beloved 28 hours straight.
Think about the other whales.
They'll be like "Shut the fuck up."
"Don't sing for another second."
It would be like a song playing on the radio.
Once more.
I promise I won't ask for more.
Okay, just once.
Hi.
Where have you been?
You want to see me tonight?
I'll be there in eight minutes.
What are you doing?
Our skipper is dozing on the deck.
Assa.
Where are you?
Its me Assa.
Talk to me...
Congratulations.
More gasoline!
Oh, hi.
- This is fucking genuine!
A bonfire of the Vanities?
- Come with us!
Cops!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Fucking shit!
Those ugly color sneakers are a hit now.
Congratulations.
What do we market next?
Make tracksuits the new trend,... and I'll buy you a box of champagne.
ANNA AND ASSA'S HOUSEWARMING PARTY
Food and drinks.
Kids are welcome.
Bad news?
Make tracksuits the new trend?
I need a bigger challenge.
I know.
Sandals with socks.
Hi.
I'm here to look at the room.
You don't eat meat, do you?
Why?
- I'm a vegan.
I'll call you.
You have fiber optic cable?
- Excuse me?
How come you don't know?
Are you fifteen or something?
- I'll call you.
How would you describe yourself?
- I'm a night person.
Okay.
I'll call you.
Oh.
- Hi!
I'm here to look at the room.
Sure.
Before I let you in,... tell me how you would define yourself.
How I would define myself?
I don't believe in definitions.
You know what?
The room is yours.
- Of course.
You owe me a shirt.
- Deduct it from my rent.
In front of the Parliament House?
- That is an outstanding idea.
Maybe a couple of other places, too?
- Yes, central places.
Hola!
Greetings from Barcelona.
- Thanks.
That's okay.
Hi.
- Please go on.
Don't mind me.
You two have met, right?
Alex started the whole movement.
- Hi.
What is this Flash Attack?
A performance group?
- No.
Yes.
- No.
- Yes.
- No.
Is it or isn't it?
- It is.
I don't want to define it in any way.
- I'll define it.
There's no need to.
- I'll define it.
I'm pissed off... because people don't realize what is happening around them.
I want people to wake up and see things from a new perspective.
You don't have to live your life with blinders over your eyes.
I'll be happy to nudge people in the right direction.
There is one question I want to ask.
What will be left in the world when we die?
For me, this is about leaving a mark in history.
I want to distinguish myself from the masses.
- I see.
And now you're leaving your mark with these posters?
In a way...
If I wanted to leave a mark, I'd leave a real brand.
What do you mean?
- What would it be?
Remember the Brazilian priest who tried to fly with balloons?
Yes, he failed and died.
But he will be remembered forever.
A lot longer than this mundane crap.
This is a great idea, but take it further.
His idea is an old one.
We have a summerhouse by the sea...
Oh, hi!
What's up?
The maestro himself.
Hi!
- Nice house.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
You think I've fucking missed you?
Huh?
Saku, where are you?
I'm glad you came.
It's been a long time...
We'll talk later.
- Sure.
Where's her husband?
- He's in the garden.
He's that wealthy-looking Captain America.
I'm bored.
Let's go to my place.
Vilma's having a party.
Congratulations on your new home!
- Thanks, Miia.
Hi, Miia.
You look good.
That went well.
How are you, chief?
Really great.
- That's nice to hear.
Stay strong.
Nice seeing you.
Assa, let's get the fuck out of here.
That didn't go so well.
- Should we go?
You don't have to leave.
I promised Vilma I'd drop by at her party.
I can't leave.
I can't leave my party.
- Geez, what a doormat.
Come with me.
- I won't.
- Okay, don't come with me.
I won't!
You know where to find me.
It's unbelievable that there are guys... who think they can do whatever they want.
If I had done the same,...
I probably would've killed myself.
What are you talking about?
- Your friend.
The spearer.
You think he should've killed himself?
You know what he did to Miia.
Based on what Anna has told Miia,... he hasn't changed.
- That's right.
At least not for the better.
He should accept that he's not a star anymore.
...die.
A great party!
- Hi.
Was your party good?
A garden swing, children, non-alcoholic punch.
Megalikes.
Eerika!
You have to get rid of your polo shirt.
Make him Japanese.
Let's destroy apathy.
Let's not accept this apathy that keeps our eyes closed.
Let's not succumb to sleep.
Let's not follow the masses.
Friends, let's aim higher.
Let's destroy apathy.
I lived like you when I first moved to Helsinki.
But I was twenty!
Twenty!
Soon I'll be thirty, and I want to move forward in life.
I don't want to be part of that lifestyle.
What do you mean?
You want to break up with me?
What do you mean?
I want a man, not a teenage boy.
- I want to be that man.
I am that man.
Okay, I won't see Saku anymore.
I don't want you to abandon your friends.
Can't you see...
Can't you...
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I don't want to live without you.
What?
I don't want to live without you.
Marry me.
Are you serious?
What?
I went to my best friend's party last night.
Did you?
In a way, he's right.
You have to do what feels right.
Destroying is easy.
Building is hard.
The idea is that we should build something surprising... that will encourage others to build something new.
Let's not accept this apathy that keeps our eyes closed.
Let's not succumb to sleep.
Let's get going!
The afterparty is downtown.
Let's move.
Oh yeah.
Assa!
My brother.
How did the rest of the party go?
- Really good.
I punched Pan...
Good.
What did Anna say?
- She threw a fit.
Really?
Don't tell me she left you.
I'm sorry.
It would be terrible if you broke up.
I proposed to her.
What?
I got down on my knees and the whole works.
- Why?
Because I love her.
Wait a minute.
You're screwing with me.
- I want you to be my best man.
Nothing will change.
I promise.
How about congratulations or something like that?
Friends usually congratulate...
That's it.
Now we'll wait for an Indian summer.
Thank you.
It's a wrap.
Indian summer.
Indian summer.
See you at the café.
I'll give you a feather.
Don't shake your head like that.
You're not going anywhere!
- Wonderful!
You're a naughty boy.
- Yes, I've been so naughty.
Get in and we'll go.
- Hurry up!
Ladies and not so ladylike ladies!
Lance Armstrong!
Weather homo.
Ls Anna really worth all this?
- Yes.
I'm sitting there with my dick out,... drinking beer and watching porn on TV...
Chief, why don't you just shut up.
Let's change the subject.
Ladies and gentlemen, Night Club Kaivohuone.
Hi.
I know.
I'll call my friend.
His dad is someone big in Moscow.
He said I can borrow his airplane.
We'll party in Moscow.
- Sure, spearer.
You talk big, but no one has taken you seriously in years.
That's right.
My wife Rita said you're the biggest loser she's ever met.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I thought your wife was in love with me... because she begged for more sex at Assa's party.
You didn't know that I fucked your wife... in her bachelorette party?
"Oh my gosh."
"Oh my gosh."
Hold this.
Sorry, I didn't mean to hit you.
- Too bad.
Tele and Tubby started this!
Come and try again!
Come here!
Peace.
Let it go.
Assa?
I've had enough getting kicked out of bars.
This was meant to happen.
- You mean this?
You think your bachelor party is over?
Well, I've still got a couple of intact organs.
Thanks for the bachelor party.
You're welcome.
You ever think about where this train is going?
- Yes.
I think about it all the time.
Ever since that accident,...
I've asked myself if there's any sense in all this.
Does there need to be sense?
Can't we just be?
Let life guide you.
I'll ask one last time.
Please, don't do this to yourself.
Don't become a dog.
Think really hard if Anna is worth it.
Yes, she is.
No, she's not.
Shit.
I was supposed to see Saku.
- Today?
What do I tell him?
Hi.
- Where are you?
Your beer is getting cold.
I'm sorry.
Something came up...
Do you have time next week?
Do I have time?
Let me check my calendar.
I have all kinds of things,... but I think I'll be able to fit you.
I'm really sorry.
This isn't about you.
Please, do me a favor... and stop talking to me like you talk to women.
Anna is ovulating.
We're making a baby.
Anna is ovulating.
They're making a baby.
That's beautiful.
I won't bother you any longer.
Please continue.
Bye.
He didn't like that.
Assa flaked out again?
- They're trying to have a baby.
You want to take a last-minute flight somewhere?
- Okay.
Really?
Always.
A contest.
Who comes up with the yuckiest shot?
Whoever pukes first loses.
- Okay.
C. 0.
C. K.
Wow, this is fresh!
- You're perfect.
Let's get married.
- Oh, honey...
As much as I like you, I can't be with you.
Because I'm a man and you're a woman?
- Well, yeah.
Relationships are not for you.
You know that.
I can be in a relationship if I want to.
- Uh-huh.
I bet you won't last a month with someone.
Will you go to bed with me if I do?
- No.
Will you marry me if I do?
- Yes, I will.
I will.
You will...
You're perfect.
Excuse me.
Can you bring me a glass of water... cause I'm so hungry that I don't know... where to spend the night?
C'mon, don't be like that.
Be like this.
I'm Saku.
Can I buy you a drink?
Hi, honey.
I thought we'd go for a picnic.
You remembered our one-month anniversary.
That's why we're going for a picnic.
- You mean like, in the snow?
Yeah, like in the snow.
No, at my place.
You're sweet.
Did you have a good day?
- It was okay.
Were the customers nice?
Guess what I'd like to do next?
- What?
Like, go rent a movie.
Like, make hot chocolate and cuddle.
You know what I'd like to do next, like?
You probably want to go rent a movie.
Make hot chocolate and cuddle.
Travel to Tallinn for sushi.
My friend has a helicopter, and he owes me a flight.
I'm serious.
- That's a great idea but can't we just stay home and watch W?
Don't be a fucking granny, okay?
What's wrong with chilling at home with your sweetheart?
Wouldn't it be cooler to chill in Tallinn with your sweetheart?
In Prague, New York or wherever.
Huh?
It would.
You get tired of champagne if you drink it all the time.
- What's that?
If everything is always so awesome,... nothing will be awesome in the end.
- What a load of shit.
Honey, look at me.
Let's go watch TV, please.
Go watch TV by yourself.
Please.
Maybe I will.
Honey bunny, don't be mad at me.
Saku is really sorry.
Teddy bear's here to cheer you up.
What the fuck is going on?
Huh?
- C'mon.
How do you dare?
If you want to cuddle, I'll find you a girlfriend.
Are you crazy?
- Yes, for letting a lesbian seduce my girlfriend.
The girlfriend you got to get me in bed.
- You're my fuckin' roommate!
Are you fuckin' blind?
I'm cleaning up your mess here!
I'll go to the bar.
Have your ass out before I get back.
I wish I had been wrong about you.
You're nothing but a co-dependent loser.
You live through other people.
Like I said, I'm going to the bar.
Have your ass out before I get back.
And her, too.
- Fuck you!
And grow up, for fuck's sake!
Hi
- Assa, we have to meet.
How about tomorrow?
Get back to bed!
Anna, back to bed
What did you want to say?
Nothing, actually.
Bye.
Are you in bed already?
- I'm not telling you.
What are you doing?
- I'm not telling you.
Are you hiding?
- Yes.
The problem is not that he wants that.
He doesn't know what he wants.
Remember that I want a girl.
I've known him since childhood
I've saved him from his choices.
My friend 3 girlfriend mined our friendship too.
He used to party, but now when you call him,... he'll tell you he'll stay home with his girl... and do the dishes together.
Shut up for a moment.
It's insane.
And now this insemination.
I mean, think about.
He's twenty-one and he's living like... like he's thirty.
That's right.
I don't want to go home!
We have to go.
- I wanted to stay in daycare.
I don't want to!
No, I don't want to!
Good evening.
I'll give you 10 euros if you beat me up.
Alcoholic.
Fuck!
I think this time we did it.
I'm serious.
- Seriously?
Who's that?
Shit.
What happened?
- Mira left me.
I'll ask him to come in.
Don't move.
- I won't.
I don't want to see him.
- We'll go out.
I'll be back at ten.
You said you wouldn't drink.
- One beer can't ruin the whole load.
Don't go.
- At eleven.
How are you?
Well, making a baby is a little harder than I thought.
We lost a baby at six weeks.
- What?
A miscarriage?
People say it's common,... but it's really tough, especially for Anna.
Anna felt she'd failed somehow.
But you lost that baby too.
Right?
It's okay if you're hurting, too.
Night?
I'll go get us another round.
- You sure?
Yes.
I need another one.
Ring the doorbell.
Stomp your feet a little.
- Why didn't you ring the bell?
Guess who's staying over?
- Hello, princess!
You stink.
We got you a burger.
It's a love burger.
Okay, I'll put it in the refrigerator.
Why didn't you answer my calls?
I called you many times.
- Calm down.
Let me see.
Oh, my volume is turned off.
Do you realize how worried I was?
You realize how worried I was?
I'm sorry.
How can I have a baby with you if I can't trust you?
Are you going to do this when I have a baby?
When you have a baby?
You, you.
Did you hear?
We're making a baby for her.
- I didn't mean that.
You should've thought about that... before you made me marry you and stopped using birth control.
You wanted that!
You proposed to me.
You stopped using birth control.
- We agreed on it.
Okay.
Let's calm down.
The damage is already done;
you're married.
What would you do, princess?
- Get the fuck out.
I'm not staying with this nag.
Fine.
Get the fuck out of here.
Both of you.
What?
- Get the fuck out of here now!
I'm not leaving my TV here.
I'm taking it with me.
Saku, take the lamp from the porch.
Take the fucking lamp from the porch.
I won't leave my TV here.
That's right.
This is how we get the fuck out of here.
Saku, let's get the fuck out of here.
This is how we do it.
Come and watch TV with us.
Let's go.
Is Assa here?
He's sleeping.
I want to talk to him now.
He's really tired.
- I need to talk to him now.
That's why you broke up.
It's just "me, me, me."
There's nothing to see here.
Seppo.
Seppo.
Honey.
This is not me.
I'm not like this.
I'm not like this.
Let's go home.
If you ever come near me, I'll kill you.
Get ready for broadcast.
Seppo, two minutes.
We have a rain front coming in from northwest.
From the southwest...
Who knows about these.
As you can see, here we have cuntolous clouds...
Cut!
Cut!
What are you waving at me for?
You're in the same boat.
Stay behind the camera or I'll tape you to it.
A MOMENT, PLEASE
Holy shit...
That's a wrap.
What happened?
How can I be in the same spot again?
Why didn't I apologize to her after all those fights?
How can I be so stupid?
Why was I so proud that I let things go this far?
Anna is the best woman I've ever met,... but we're like oil and water.
Fuck, oil and water...
Assa.
- Okay.
I had something, but I blew it.
- Stop.
That's enough of crying.
I've been listening to you whine for six months now.
It won't take you anywhere.
Stop.
Okay.
Thank you.
- Thank you, Saku.
No, thank you.
- Don't make fun of everything.
Thank you.
- Thank you if you stop.
Fuck you and your jokes.
Really, we got to go downtown.
Let's go.
Ready, steady...
Look, a moose!
Look, Jesus!
You're so dumb.
I bet you won't be able... to get a woman to take off her bra in here.
I just want to get drunk.
I'm too tired to play.
This amusement park is open and we've got access to all rides.
The night is young.
If you lose, you'll get a tattoo.
I don't know what to tattoo.
- I'll do the dishes for six months.
Deal.
Hi, Cheryl.
I've been wanting to apologize for the way we behaved last time and the time before that.
We had a difficult childhood.
- Can you leave?
I admire you.
- I'm not interested.
I'm serious.
It's great that you exist.
You make the rest of us feel superior.
Cheryl, you're a modern Jesus.
You're a heroine willing to sacrifice herself.
- Don't touch me.
I'm asking you for a small favor... after all this sucking up to you.
Will you give me your bra?
I tripped.
Haven't you ever tripped?
What?
Assa, calm down.
You calm down!
- I am calm.
Of course you are.
Why do you always provoke me?
Explain it to me.
- We're having fun.
Besides, it would've been wrong... if they hadn't kicked us out.
This is fun?
We're trying to have fun with a taste of blood in our mouths?
Why is it always me who tastes it?
Explain that to me!
Move.
Fucking move!
Are you going to move or what?
Move!
Fucking move.
Move!
Move.
Move.
Move.
Move...
Fucking move!
Fucking move!
There are people who will pick up a coin from the urinal.
Then there are people who will put the coin there... to see who'll pick it up.
Guess which you are.
Well, well.
Superlosers on the go again.
I can tell you're in top shape.
You want to see what we just did?
You should like it.
Let me guess.
Dildos made out of Barbies, buzzing around on the streets.
Let's go home.
Let's agree you won.
What was Flash Attack?
Was it a group or these attacks or something else?
Before becoming paralyzed..
- Isn't this your new best friend?
...a big dream.
He was a Brazilian priest.
He tried to break the record for flying with helium-filled balloons.
That was my idea!
What a guy!
I told him about that.
As if that wuss would ever have the courage to do that.
Would you have the courage?
His body was found...
- would you have the courage?
But this great legend lives on.
He'll be remembered forever.
What the hell...
Assa?
What are you doing?
- I'm filling balloons.
Are you drunk?
- No.
The most sober I've been in months.
Explain.
- It's possible to break the record.
The priest would've broken it if he hadn't drifted over the ocean.
Get real.
The whole trick is an illusion.
You'll kill yourself.
- At least I will be remembered... for something other than spearing someone.
Are you with me?
Flash Patrol is calling.
Flash Patrol?
You're out of your mind.
People have definitely noticed a group called Flash Patrol
The group will try to break the record... for flying with helium-filled balloons.
A Brazilian priest was the last person to try to break the recent..
Look!
I've never seen this many balloons.
They have to be as big as possible.
- We have these.
Shelf C.
I'll jump out of the window to see if this works.
- See you.
You'll find yourself an ugly wife.
- You won't find a wife.
It almost flew.
- Let's be honest with ourselves.
This is an insane idea.
- An insanely good idea.
Neither of us has experience.
That's the point.
Dangerous and difficult.
That's what you wanted.
- Not this dangerous and difficult.
What's the worst thing that could happen?
We'll add balloons, and it'll go straight up.
This isn't that difficult.
We'll make one man fly anytime.
More helium, and he'll be airborne.
Anna.
- Fuck!
Can we talk?
Assa is in danger.
Sure, if he hangs out with you.
Move, please.
Okay, not in danger, but losing it.
You're the only one he'll listen to.
This is a long story.
I would like you to trust me.
Okay?
You want me to trust you?
Anna, I'm trying to fix things here.
- No, you're not.
You don't want to be happy,... and that's why no one else can be either.
I want to be happy.
- Why don't you stop this recklessness then?
It's not that simple.
- It's exactly that simple.
Assa realized it.
And then you came and messed his head up.
He lost his happiness and I lost mine.
So thanks a fucking lot.
I screwed up everything, but this is about Assa.
He's losing it.
Anna.
Okay, five minutes.
FLASH PATROL
Excuse me.
One question.
Why are you doing this?
Fuck.
This is senseless.
This is like trying to commit suicide.
What do I have to lose?
- You want me to list everything?
Good health.
A good job.
A good woman.
- Anna dumped me.
I lost my job.
- I'll talk to your boss.
Anna will take you back.
- Yeah, sure.
I talked to her.
Did she say she wants me back?
- Yes.
Okay, she didn't.
But she didn't say she doesn't.
I curse the day I met you.
I'm fucking stupid.
- No, you're not.
You're just a little confused.
- If she takes me back, what then?
You'll make a baby and live happily ever after.
Right?
Fuck!
There's nothing like that!
I should've believed you.
My relationships just cause tears and pain.
I'm fucking tired of crying like a girl.
I want to be a man!
Are you with me or not?
Always.
I'll do it.
No fucking way.
- My costume and my idea.
You got scared.
- No, I didn't.
You did.
- I didn't.
- You did.
We'll flip a coin.
- Heads.
Two out of three.
This is so unnecessary.
What the fuck?
Let me go.
This is for your own good.
God damn!
Assa.
You're my only and dearest friend.
Go back to Anna, okay?
You owe it to me.
- I don't owe you anything.
Soon you will.
- Did you hear what I said, dickhead?
Don't you dare go out there!
I'm sorry,... but unfortunately there will be no balloon flight today.
Why not?
- Because there's no sense in it.
Saku, I'm sure you want to use the publicity.
You'd get a lot of attention.
You'll be a hero, and not a failed javelin thrower.
I don't have the guts.
You can leave.
- Did we come here for nothing?
What do we write about now?
Saku!
I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry. just die!
That's right.
Too bad he didn't die.
Let's go.
There's nothing to see.
Yeah, yeah.
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Fuck.
Undo these!
Fuck!
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
I think I should go.
Fuck!
Saku!
Assa.
Help!
Saku!
No.
No.
No.
So you took the battery.
Fuck.
Saku, I fucking hate you.
I thank the lord every day for not getting on that thing.
People often ask me what!
think happened to you.
Based on what I know about Saku he planned it.
This was meant to happen.
Put that away.
Look!
- Shh.
I did it.
I'll go.
FOR OUR FRIENDS!

Come.
And cut.
- And peep.
Cut!
right?
Ruffians?
isn't she?
do you?
how about this:
I'll be your opponent!
What's wrong?
Does your head hurt?
This is...
Who the hell are you?
messing with a girl is something...
I just can't accept.
Wh-Who...? the recent series of ability user hunts done by Skill-Out... should finally come to an end.
-Are you all right?
Yes... however.
there's no way these stray Level 0's could ever beat a Level 4 ability user.
These bunch should have understood thi—
That doesn't seem to be the case here.
for some reason she wasn't able to use her powers and then a mysterious guy appeared...
Tamezou?
{its a name}
Konori-sempai?
sorry.
I wonder if Uiharu's questioning is going well.
Yes.
I lost consciousness.
everyone was defeated?
Yes.
Is there anything else you can remember?
Let's see...
How should I say this?
That leather-made...
The thing that men riding those two wheel vehicles often wear...
A leather jacket?
Yes!
That's it!
A black leather jacket!
And I think I saw what looked like a tattoo of a big black spider on his back.
Konori-sempai?
Is something the matter?
I've been wondering for a while... it's nothing at all.
the guy with the leather jacket and the tattoo of a black spider must be the one who did these guys in?
Big Spider" ?
Is that the name of the organization behind the ones who are serial hunting ability users?
Big Spider is an organization that is famous among Skill-Out. but lately they've resorted to just being rogues.
The pride of a Skill-Out you say?
In the end they're just a mob of people with inferiority complexes.
and un-erasable admiration for those with abilities... you're quite knowledgeable about this.
yeah.
Just what I expected from a sempai!
Kongou-san was attacked?
!
Onee-sama.
those guys are scum!
you're really worked up about this.
I just can't forgive those who don't do what they can and run from reality.
Ehhh...
It seems like you're talking about me.
you're different.
Yeah. crossing the street in a group while the light is red is how the Skill-Outs seem to operate.
you managed cross it all by yourself!
You're much more courageous than they are.
it doesn't seem like you're defending her at all..
But it seems like Skill-Outs are just jealous and angry Level 0's.
What are they trying to accomplish by hunting down people with power?
it's tough to take on that many people by yourself.
we have information that the organization Big Spider has acquired illegal weapons on the black market.
bad pun but I tried}
Onee-sama...
I'll always give you some—
That's not what I meant!
right?
It seems those guys were all defeated in one blow by a stranger.
huh?
Not at all!
idiotic criminals!
sempai...?
{senpai from the past}
Kurozuma-san!
About that guy who got Tamezou-san's group...
Don't give me that shit!
I just... he's dead.
There's no way he could still be alive.
Hey you guys!
What's my name?
!
Kurozuma Wataru!
I'm Kurozuma.
The boss of Big Spider!
right?
Guys with power that look at us with those eyes!
Those eyes!
Those guys look at us like we were idiots!
That's why we beat them up!
I'll show them what happens when Skill-Out gets serious!
Big Spider again?
Already 3 victims just this week...
They seemed to have upped the rate.
I should give those guys a hit.
Onee-sama.
Your methods cause way too many victims.
Big Spider seems to have expanded its influence about two years ago.
It's also about the time that they acquired weapons and started committing crimes.
I see.
They got some weapons and now they think they're all high and mighty.
But how did they get those in from outside Academy City? right?
They say that only those in the trade know those routes...
Is there anyone else who could have possibly opened that path?
You mean an inside job?
Yeah.
I'll see.
It's worth looking into.
I found out who Big Spider's leader is.
His name is Kurozuma Wataru.
He seems like a pretty big criminal.
He doesn't seem to care a bit about betraying his comrades.
It's said he'll even shoot you in the back if you want to escape the group.
he's the worst kind of scum isn't he?
it seems that he has a tattoo of a spider on his back.
A spider?
too.
That man was Kurozuma Wataru?
What could this mean?
but rather it was the result of an internal conflict.
right?
I see.
That's a possibility.
as their hide out.
Are you going?
then it's logical at least.
Konori-sempai.
there's a report I have to wrap up by today.
shall we go?
Go— Onee-sama?
!
now.
Let's go!
Onee-sama!
Make me write bad cheques!
}
Shirai-san seems... happy.
This is Big Spider's headquarters.
A.k.a. Strange.
Eh?
Wonderful... not really.
fish won't live there.
Despite that... it could be a fitting place for those living as Skill-Out.
Academy City is also partially to blame.
It seems like it's becoming more of a welcoming environment
It's because you're wearing that.
Onee-sama!
I was going to properly disguise... whatcha doing?
Judgement?
we might get arrested!
look what's happened.
Onee-sama.
What're you guys arguing about?
You can't leave now that you've come this far.
Hold it.
Making a pass at girls is... something I just can't respect.
Huh?
Milk?
10.8)}A Certain Scientific Railgun 415.8)}Skill-Out
Eh?
What's your problem?
Just wait for a minute.
Huh?
Um—
There's no need to put up a front just because you're front of girls.
well... you bastard.
is this all right?
Sorry for making you go all the way to get one.
we'll be leaving!
take care.
When it comes to milk it has to be Musashino milk!
I don't remember asking for help.
Sorry about that.
I had an old acquaintance that had a chest just like you girls.
I couldn't just leave you alone.
Some stranger is talking about my chest...
I don't feel defiled... wait!
Onee-sama!
Mii.
You're back already?
you coming back this early.
What about your Judgement work?
I'm doing it properly.
You should come show your face once in a while.
Working in the school is enough for me.
I'm busy with the love of my life.{love and youth} you're always like that.
did something happen?
Nothing.
I see.
I'll leave dinner preparations to you.
Aomi!
Oh wow.
Isn't it great?
It's a little secret spot of mine.
Since it gets a little stuffy down there.
The breeze here feels great.
The Strange I can see from here hasn't changed in the past two years.
The past two years?
A lot happened.
why are all the Skill-Outs concentrated here?
You guys wouldn't understand.
It's not like I don't understand.
Understand what?
The feelings of a Skill-Out.
your level doesn't increase.
too.
Like I just want to throw everything out.
We've thrown everything away.
We've ditched the "judging-everything-by-power" Academy City.
Saten-san.
I won't.
I won't throw it all away any more.
I promise I won't any more.
attaining power is like trying to reach to the sky.
Like seeing the sky from the narrow streets of this city.
But Skill-Outs are Skill-Outs.
A group of idiots doing nothing but needless things.{et tu Dakanya?
}
aren't you?
why are you guys here?
We're pursuing an organization called Big Spider.
I recommend not dropping that name around here.
then?
Never heard of him.
be careful on your way back.
what's the matter?
I'm a little curious about that guy.
TOUMA!
}
Ow!
right?
what about it?
That's about the time that Big Spider expanded its influence.
Doesn't that seem a bit interesting?
Now that you mention it...
Let's go check elsewhere.
We might find something.
wait!
What're you ass holes doing?
!
We've lost twenty soldiers from the ability user hunts already!
we've got no leads!
W-We are searching though...
Searching?
!
Don't just search!
Find it!
don't you?
Because we've been put down!
don't get put down!
Hunt those ability users and show them just how much power Big Spider really has!
Once we do that there won't be anyone who can resist us!
Roger!
That guy's alive.
there's no way.
But if he is...
If he is...
What're you guys?
Skill-Outs?
Ha ha!
Tough luck for you guys.
I'm a Level—
How's that?
!
If you don't want anything else to happe—
now!
hmm?
Try using your power now!
if you can concentrate while getting hit!
right?
Now you guys are on the bottom of the food chain.
right?
We're Judgement!
What the hell are you...
Kids should back off obedien—
How should I say thi—
I took the victims to the local branch.
Good work. and now we easily find them in the city.
its all right.
All right then.
What's this?
We're Judgement.
What's with these brats?
Little kids shouldn't be messing with us.
Judgement?
What business do you have here?
You must be Kurozuma Wataru.
Huh?
You're under arrest for being the leader of these acts of violence against ability users.
huh?
but I don't have the time to play childish games with you guys.
Leave.
You shouldn't have said that.
then I'll explain it painfully.
Onee-sama!
I can handle these guys by myself.
Why don't you decide that after you've seen our real power for yourself!
What's this sound?
It's echoing directly in my head
What's wrong?
I can't teleport!
Ojou-chan?
Evidently you can't handle us by yourself!
Kuroko!
it's as if— can you?
nano desu~} but it seems to disrupt the mental processes of an ability user.
all we Skill-Outs hear is a high pitched sound.
How did they get something like this?
!
I'll think about being nice again.
Eh?
So now you call yourself Kurozuma?
It's him!
That man!
it's that guy!
He's the one who's been getting our way!
Kurozuma-san...
What the heck is going on?
Kurozuma-san!
Kurozuma-san!
What's wrong?
!
Let's see here...
The sound!
It disappeared!
Are you all right?
Huh?
How about you?
Um...
Could you hold this for me for a second?
it's been a long time.
It can't be!
You're supposed to be dead!
there's no way you could still be alive!
does me being a ghost make it easier for you?
A ghost?
!
then I'll just send you back to your grave!
Get him!
He's alone!
We've got weapons!
you've changed.
Die!
You should stop.
you'll only cause friendly-fire.
Wait for us!
now?
yes.
That man wasn't Kurozuma?
Back then he was called Hebitani.
it seems he calls himself Kurozuma now.
right?
That was true a long time ago...
Milk really has to be—
Musashino Milk.
Konori-sempai!
It's been a long time...
Mii.
Hmm?
Huh?
Eh?
What?

What is she all worried about?
my Onee-sama.
The next episode is for mature people again.
...Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.
That's two for the Campbells...
Where are these exactly?
It's a movie theater, no bad seats... the Cosgroves, and Joey, Stan, Danny... $10 each.
How come we have to pay when everyone knows damn well they were free?
You're such a Jew.
Your friends in Hollywood know you talk that way?
And let me tell you- you're the Jew, trying to make 30 bucks on something you got for free.
25 on Clay by a knockout.
Liston is favored for a reason.
- Cassius Clay is scared.
- Of what, pray tell?
He had an elevated heart rate before the last fight.
Who says that means you're scared?
It happens to me all the time.
It runs in my family.
Liston has the weight.
And he's never been knocked out.
Sonny's old.
He's experienced.
Don, I've got your ticket.
You want to put something down?
Stan's got a barber who makes book.
Yeah, who do you like?
I was just saying
I think Clay'd make one hell of an adman.
You're right.
Gimme 100 on Liston.
Joining us for a little pre-fight steak and cocktails at the palm?
Absolutely.
Samsonite team, in my office.
Listen, if it comes up with Jennifer,
I did pay for the seats.
Can you make a dinner reservation before the bout for Mr. Sterling and me anywhere but the palm?
I don't know why everyone cares so much about it.
If I wanted to see two negroes fight,
I'd throw a dollar bill out my window.
I thought we were doing this at 9:00.
It's 11:15.
I'm late, but you're not.
Good work so far.
- Where do you want me?
- Behind the desk is fine.
You're in a white studio, like in some limbo.
There's two no-name football players holding an American tourister and a skyway going against Mr. Joe Namath and his defender, a sexy girl holding a samsonite, and maybe a referee.
So we hear "hut hut, hike!" Namath fades back.
"Oh no, it's a blitz!"... punch in on Namath, he says something like...
"The secret to victory on the road is samsonite.
I carry it because it's tough and no matter what comes at me, I know I'm protected."
As they fall, the competitors will bust open, clothing flying out.
Touchdown, samsonite!
- "I've got it, honey." - "You sure do, Joe."
"Samsonite... it's tough."
Endorsements are lazy, and I don't like Joe Namath.
He hasn't even played in a professional game yet.
He's very handsome.
And women don't buy suitcases.
Dr. faye says they do.
Could you leave us, please?
Peggy, I'm glad that this is an environment where you feel free to fail.
You wanted to go with Danny's idea.
Because it works...
"only samsonite is tough."
It's the execution that's the problem.
- Okay, should it be funny?
- Actually funny?
Maybe.
Funny like what I just saw?
No.
- Hello.
- You remembered my birthday.
Did you open my present?
I am.
Hold on.
My goodness.
I'm finally doing what I should've done years ago.
Phillips-Olson- something probably, but I'll need you.
I want to form an agency that specializes in women's products with you as my creative director.
I don't know what to say.
But you're smiling, right?
I have some very- sort of a little under the table, but very high-level talks with the people at tampax.
Peggy, it's tampax- 50% market share.
I mean they're really up there.
Plus that queer at belle jolie has been barking up my tree.
Plus I have my European connections.
It sounds exciting.
The train's leaving the station, honey.
Get onboard.
Where am I calling you?
I'm in my office at home.
So you already told grey?
I'm not wasting my talents over there anymore.
Believe me, it was mutual.
Duck, did you lose your job?
Peggy, this is good.
I'm not gonna lie.
I was a little inspired by what Draper did.
Now I just need some accounts.
It's tough because, well... it's tough to get a credit line.
So what do you have so far?
I know it's not a diamond necklace, but I did spend some money on those cards.
And I appreciate the gesture.
It's just...
I don't know whether to take this seriously, because I suspect you've been drinking.
Well, you're wrong.
I heard about the Clios.
I have to see you tonight.
I have plans.
What, with that Mark?
He's another one.
Duck, you are a valuable account man.
You have a bright future.
You just need to go to one of those headhunters and...
- I need to see you, babe.
- Don't do that.
Peg, I'm falling apart.
Don't you know you're the last thing that made me feel good about myself?
Pull your hands out of your panties.
I can't talk right now....
I want to see you tonight.
You been farting in here?
...
I have to go.
We're going to lunch.
I don't know if you could tell, but he hated it.
I was hating it too while we were doing it, but not before.
I'm not gonna lie.
So we're back to the drawing board.
Still gotta eat.
Come on, it's your birthday.
We'll let you talk through lunch.
You got a call while you were in the toilet to the direct line...
Stephanie from California, no last name.
She says it's urgent.
- Would you like me to place the call?
- No, I've got it.
Bad news.
Our night is ruined.
I took care of that.
The kids are going to the palm.
We are going anywhere else.
Well, the brotherhood of alcoholics anonymous...
Freddy and Cal Rutledge from Pond's... will be joining us for dinner and the fight, which means we'll have to drink before dinner if we want to drink at all.
And then there's all the talk about drinking where they start with the funny stories and they end up crying.
Again.
15 months I've been waiting for this fight.
$300.
Liston has to lose by unconsciousness.
- Get rid of 'em.
- I can't.
- I should work on samsonite.
- That's in two weeks.
I'm gonna be in Florida.
Now this is your job too.
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry.
You can do that without me.
- Samsonite you can't.
- Are you serious?
We can solve this problem with a flask.
No, I wouldn't be good company anyway.
That's never bothered me before.
I don't know what it is, but I look at the side of your neck and I wish I had one of those James Bond pens so I could jam a dart in it.
James Bond likes to travel.
He goes all over the world.
He goes underwater.
He met a girl underwater.
I think this is a good place to stop.
See you tomorrow.
Oh, great.
I don't like sitting at my desk and looking into a garbage dump.
Although I am paid less, I am still not a janitor.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Doing something special for your birthday?
Mark is taking me to dinner... the forum of the twelve caesars.
- Ooh.
- Yes.
- How old are you?
- 26 today.
Well, you're doing all right, aren't you?
Well, hello.
- Did I hear it's your birthday?
- It is.
- How are you feeling?
- Well, of course my days are spent sleeping and visiting the ladies' room, although it's an incredible feeling having this baby kick me.
Is it any different than living with Pete?
You're witty.
I always assumed that, but it turns out it's true.
Are you going to watch the fight?
Oh, yes.
I've been watching boxing since I was a little girl.
My father loves blood sport.
Mr. Draper's looking for you.
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
Happy Birthday.
You know, 26 is still very young.
Have fun.
I want a rare steak and I want to see those two men pound each other.
Cynthia's at the restaurant.
We should go.
What about Jennifer?
Oh, don't go in there.
Don't do it.
- She's dead.
- Let's beat it before it's us.
- I was just on my way out.
- Did you get California?
Do you want me to try before I depart?
There's a time difference, you know.
I do, but it goes the other way.
Good night, Mr. Draper.
Get in here.
Why don't you talk to Joan and get rid of her?
No, Joan knew exactly what I needed and made sure that I got it.
So where are we on samsonite?
We'll have something to show you in the morning.
But the suspense is killing me.
Well, I kind of was on my way out.
Let me just see where we are.
I guess I've got a minute.
Okay.
We thought that samsonite is this very rare element, this mythical substance, the hardest on earth- and we see an adventurer leaping through a cave.
Is this a substance much like bullshit?
I thought we could drop one off the eiffel tower with a countdown- like the moonshot... and show how it doesn't break.
- But it would, wouldn't it?
- Probably.
The government has prohibited us from doing things like that, Peggy.
They feel that it is not in the public interest.
We have a thing with samson, because he's strong... and his hair.
I gave you more responsibility and you didn't do anything?
That you like.
We did work... a lot.
I don't care if you work 10 seconds if you bring me something I like.
We're going to do this right now.
Oh, I know you have plans.
You were going to call me from a bar with an idea?
Do you think elves do this?
You're just gonna change it anyway.
Excuse me?
!
- This is Mark Kerney.
- I am so sorry.
I got drawn into his web.
It's gonna be a while.
A while like soon, or a while like I should cancel?
15 minutes?
It shouldn't take too long.
- He's going to the boxing match.
- He's going to Maine?
You can watch it on closed-circuit TV in the movie theaters.
We got tickets.
How come we didn't go?
Because we're having a romantic dinner for my birthday.
Well, did you tell him that?
Look, I'm the only one who can help him with this and the sooner I get off the phone, the sooner I can come.
Just hurry, will you?
She's gonna be a few minutes late.
A surprise on top of a surprise.
She works too hard.
"The oysters of Hercules, which you with sword shall carve."
I saw a tray pass by.
They look like hockey pucks.
$1.65.
You should let Gerry get this.
Mom, don't cut the kid off at the knees.
Now what if an elephant either sits on or steps on the suitcase?
How about a slow-moving airplane runs it over?
Do you like Cassius Clay?
- He's very handsome.
- I don't think so.
You're not supposed to.
I remember my mother talking about nat king Cole in a way that made my father throw out all his records.
He's got a big mouth.
"I'm the greatest." " Not if you have to say it."
Muhammad Ali.
Do you like the airplane?
Liston just goes about his business, works methodically.
Clay will dance and talk, throw a few until he's wiped out.
A bag under an airplane looks like there's been an accident.
Three classes of suitcase... featherweight, middleweight, heavyweight... for whatever class you're in.
But how do you do that on TV?
- What's the story?
- You don't like it?
No, I love it.
That's great.
That's what we should do.
Let it ring.
I'll say you're not here.
Hello?
Oh hello, Roger.
No, he's not here.
I answer other people's phones all the time.
I'm going to count to three, then I'm gonna start saying a lot of words you don't like, sweetheart.
- This should be good.
- I'm begging you...
Get down here right away.
You think I'd rather be working?
Yeah, I do.
Did you know
Freddy Rumsen collects Indian arrowheads?
Where are you?
There's a bar next to Keenes.
I've been sneaking off to fortify myself.
Tell 'em you're sick.
Go home.
I am sick.
I think I overdid it.
And they're self-so-righteous.
I never pissed my pants.
This guy Rutledge killed a man with a motorboat.
You know what gets you over something like that?
Drinking.
Still got your ticket.
It's an attractive offer.
Look out your window.
Can you see me?
Good night, sweetheart.
Go ahead.
I'll wait.
- Hello.
- 15 minutes?
It's almost an hour.
I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna leave any minute.
Did you at least have something?
You have to get down here.
You have to get down here right away.
I can't just leave, okay?
But you have to, okay?
You know what?
Just go to my apartment and wait for me.
We can eat there another time.
No, I don't want to do that.
- I'll make it worth your while.
- Damn it, Peggy.
I've got your whole family here for a surprise dinner, okay?
And the only way you can make it worse is by not coming at all.
Oh, Mark.
I'm so sorry.
I'm coming right now.
Thank you.
Well, so much for the surprise.
Okay, I'm going to leave if that's all right with you.
I'm not so sure about it.
I mean every time we get into this, we abandon the toughness idea.
Maybe there's something to the elephant.
Do you want one?
I'm sorry.
Do you have someplace to be?
Maybe tap your foot so I get the message.
I was supposed to be at dinner an hour ago.
It's my birthday, and I'm pretty sure
I ruined everything.
- Why the hell didn't you tell me?
- I don't know.
Because I thought this would take a second.
So now I'm supposed to feel like crap?
Oh, I'm so sick that I ruined her birthday.
Do you know when my birthday is?
- I was your secretary!
- Well, enjoy your evening!
By the way, you are 20-something years old.
It's time to get over birthdays.
Go ahead.
I'll do it myself.
Yes, I'm that important.
So the fact that you're calling means that you haven't left yet.
I'm not gonna be able to make it at all.
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm sorry, but no one asked you to do this.
You said you never had a surprise.
I can't believe you.
This is your mother speaking.
Hello, ma.
I just want you to know that we're all here...
Me, Anita, Gerry, the roommate... and we're not leaving until you march in here.
I can't, okay?
Could you put Mark on the phone?
He's crestfallen, you know?
- Mrs. Olson, it's okay.
- It's not okay.
Now he's making excuses for you.
I don't know how many nice boys you think are lining up for you.
You should be grateful.
Okay, goodbye.
- Hello?
- I'm sorry I ruined this and I'm sorry you had to spend the evening with my mother.
You know what?
She's right.
Really?
Then why don't you date her?
She's never even had a job.
How the hell are you mad at me?
Because you used my birthday to get in good with a bunch of people who drive me crazy.
Should I have invited don?
You never stand him up.
What's the point of doing anything nice for you?
Jesus.
You even sound like my mother.
I'm already into this place for $40.
If you don't mind, I'm going to enjoy my dinner and you enjoy your work.
The fact that you would stay there... you know what?
- Forget it.
- No.
What?
You want to do this right now?
- Do what?
- Fine.
It's been nice knowing you.
Happy Birthday.
- So that's it?
- Yup.
Good night.
Hello?
It'll be fine.
Couples fight.
Ask Gerry.
What's wrong?
Elevator out?
I think I just broke up with Mark.
Oh.
Really?
...
I think so.
So go home.
Nope.
I'm ready to work.
You win.
Again.
You could've just told me it was your birthday.
Right, and there'd be no repercussions.
- So now this is my fault?
- Well, it's not my fault you don't have a family, friends or anywhere else to go.
Go.
Go.
Run to him like in the movies.
- You don't have to be here.
- I do have to be here because of some stupid idea from Danny who you had to hire because you stole his other stupid idea because you were drunk.
Don't get personal because you didn't do your work.
And by the way, I know it kills you, but guess what:
There is no "Danny's idea."
Everything that comes in here belongs to the agency.
You mean you.
- As long as you still work here.
- Is that a threat?
Because I've already taken somebody up on one of those tonight.
- Relax.
- You know what?
Here's a blank piece of paper.
Why don't you turn that into glo-coat?
Are you out of your mind?
You gave me 20 ideas and I picked out one of them that was a kernel that became that commercial.
- So you remember.
- I do.
It was something about a cowboy.
Congratulations.
No, it was something about a kid locked in a closet because his mother was making him wait for the floor to dry, which is basically the whole commercial.
- It's a kernel.
- Which you changed just enough
- so that it was yours.
- I changed it into a commercial.
What, are we going to shoot him in the dark in the closet?
That's the way it works.
There are no credits on commercials.
- But you got the clio!
- It's your job!
I give you money, you give me ideas.
And you never say thank you.
That's what the money is for!
You're young.
You will get your recognition.
And honestly, it is absolutely ridiculous to be two years into your career and counting your ideas.
Everything to you is an opportunity.
And you should be thanking me every morning when you wake up, along with Jesus, for giving you another day!
Oh, come on.
I'm sorry about your boyfriend, okay?
May 25th.
Ideas for samsonite.
Toughness means that......
Peggy, get in here.
- No.
- Come on.
You have to come in here right now.
What do you want?
You have to hear this.
Sit down.
Come on.
Sit.
So this is tape #4 of "Sterling's gold," by Roger Sterling.
So where was I?
Burt Cooper hated me and I thought it was because he thought I'd be an ally of my father,
but it turned out it was something to do with my joie de vivre,
My romantic prowess...
See tape #3...
Including some time with the queen of perversions, his secretary Ida Blankenship.
You know what?
Don't use her name.
But it was all about him hating my very youth, all because the poor guy had been cut down in the height of his sexual prime by an unnecessary orchiectomy.
Lyle Evans, M.D.
I think he had him killed.
Anyway, sometime in the summer of '48...
No, 1932...
No, 1939.
Why are you laughing?
It's like reading someone's diary.
Come on.
Ida was a hellcat?
Cooper lost his balls?
Roger's writing a book?
I should go.
- Stay and visit.
- I've got nothing to say.
- Sure you do.
- No, it's personal.
We have personal conversations.
No, we don't, and I think you like it that way.
I know I do.
Suit yourself.
We're supposed to be staring at each other over candlelight and he invites my mother?
He doesn't know me.
It's not my fault.
I guess I'm back to square one.
Single.
Well, as Danny would say, there's no use crying over fish in the sea.
Mouse!
Over there!
- What are you doing?
- Get the suitcase.
- Why?
- I'm gonna seal it up in my nice samsonite
- and throw it off the roof.
- Don't.
Come on.
Every idea you have is some version of that.
Let's do it.
Where'd you go, Mickey?
- I think it's a rat.
- It's a mouse.
I grew up on a farm.
You know what?
There's a way out of this room we don't know about.
Are you okay?
I think that's yours.
It's probably Mark.
I don't want to answer it.
It's still your birthday.
Let me get you dinner.
What's the most exciting thing about a suitcase?
Going somewhere.
The acropolis.
I'd like to go to Greece.
I heard all the good cooks stayed there.
I'd like to just go on a plane.
I've never been.
- Is that right?
- I've heard about it, obviously.
I've seen it in the movies.
It's an incredible idea... flying.
I remember on the way to Korea they told us how many thousand feet in the air we were.
There was some other kid there... more of a yokel than me, even... and he screamed, "man wasn't meant to fly!"
Cooper has no testicles?
Ick.
I don't want water.
My uncle Max said he had a suitcase that was always packed.
He said, "a man has to be ready to go at any moment."
Jesus.
Maybe it's a metaphor.
There's something to that idea.
I don't know.
I can't tell the difference anymore between something that's good and something that's awful.
Well, they're very close.
But the best idea always wins and you'll know it when you see it.
Keep banging your head against the wall then it happens.
And then it's done.
Yes, ma'am.
Not like everything else in my life.
I mean, I know what I'm supposed to want, but it just never feels right...
Or as important as anything in that office.
- I didn't know you were in Korea.
- Very briefly.
Did you shoot anybody?
Nope.
I saw some people get killed.
That's memorable.
My father died right in front of me...
Heart attack.
I was 12.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It was pretty violent.
The TV was on.
That's why I hate sports.
Nobody was around...
Saturday afternoon.
My mother was shopping.
I saw my father die too.
He was kicked by a horse....
You're kidding.
- What about your mother?
- I never knew her.
Why is there a dog in the Parthenon?
That is a roach.
Let's go someplace darker.
I hate dating.
I'm terrible at it.
You'll find someone.
You know you're cute as hell.
Men don't exactly stop and stare in the streets.
Do you want that?
That's not what you were supposed to say.
What do you care what I think?
Well, everybody thinks I slept with you to get the job.
They joke about it, like it's so funny because the possibility was so remote.
It's not because you aren't attractive.
I have to keep rules about work.
I have to.
You're an attractive girl, Peggy.
Not as attractive as some of your other secretaries,
I guess.
You don't want to start giving me morality lessons, do you?
People do things, right?
My mother thinks you were responsible, because you were the only person who visited me in the hospital.
Jesus.
Really?
She hates you.
Do you know who it was?
Of course I do.
Do you ever think about it?
I try not to...
But then it comes up out of nowhere.
Playgrounds.
Get up!
Get up!
- Come on!
Get up!
- Get up!
- Come on, get up!
- Get up.
- Come on.
- Come on, get up!
Get up!
Get up!
- Come on, get up!
- Come on, get up!
Get up!
Get up, bum!
- Come on.
- It's a fix.
- The fix is in.
- What happened?
- It's over.
- Already?
Who won?
- Clay.
- Don't believe that for a second.
No one goes down like that.
That's what the man just said.
Some fight.
I lost 100 bucks in two minutes.
Let's go back, pack up and go home.
Damn elevator's like a rocket.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Are you okay?
Do you want any water?
What?
I have toothpaste and a toothbrush in my desk.
Peggy?
...
- Peggy.
- I'll be right back.
Peggy?
Duck?
What are you doing?
Leaving Draper a little present.
Don't!
That's disgusting.
Would you let me concentrate?
This is Roger's office.
Now come one.
Pull up your pants.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Baby.
Baby, I need you so bad.
You wouldn't answer your phone and your roommate said you were still at work.
Why didn't you answer the phone, Peewee?
What's going on?
Just go lay down.
You don't belong in here.
So, Peggy, I see you're not alone.
I guess when screwing me couldn't get you anything, you had to go back to Draper.
- Duck, let's go.
- No.
That's right.
We were in love.
Turns out she's just another whore.
Hey!
Jesus!
Would you stop?
!
Stop it!
You're both drunk!
You know, I killed 17 men at Okinawa.
Uncle.
What the hell is wrong with you?
You still think you're better than me?
Come on, Peggy.
Let's go.
I got rid of him.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Are you?
I, uh...
I never thought...
I'm so sorry.
I... you know what?
I don't know why I was with him.
- It was a confusing time.
- Stop.
You don't have to explain.
Can you get me a drink?
How long are you gonna go on like this?
I have to make a phone call and I know it's going to be bad, okay?
Oh.
Do you want to be alone?
Just make me a drink.
Sorry if I embarrassed you.
Shh.
- Hello.
- It's me.
She's gone.
I know.
She wanted you to know.
I'm sorry I didn't call.
I was... did she want to talk to me?
You know, she wasn't really there.
I'm coming out.
I'll make the arrangements.
No need.
She left her body to science.
She said that she wanted to go to U.C.L.A. Medical school tuition-free.
Of course she did.
I'm coming out.
I'll take care of the house.
I'd like to stay here if that's okay with you, take some time off from school.
Of course.
That's fine.
She's in a better place.
That's what they say.
It's late and it's been a long day.
Okay.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Stephanie.
What happened?
Somebody very important to me died.
Who?
The only person in the world who really knew me.
That's not true.
You should go home.
You can come in late.
I'll be fine.
I'm so sorry.
Good night.
Drop and give me 20.
You asshole.
Get to work.
It's 10:30, maggot.
- Oh.
- Did you spend the night here?
- Yeah.
- See the fight?
No.
90 seconds of boxing and three hours of analysis.
- And we still don't know who won.
- Clay won.
Read the paper.
Come in.
You look fresh.
Did you go home?
I spruced up.
Come over here.
Look at this.
I think you have to know the photo.
It's on the front page of every paper.
It's historic.
How do we know it's the tourister that got knocked out?
Because the slogan will say so.
How do you put it on TV?
Are they animated?
Why are you shitting on this?
I'm tired.
It's good.
It's very good.
Give it to Joey...
No, Stan...
Then go home, shower, then come back and give me 10 tag lines.
Okay.
Open or closed?
Open.
...Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.
That's two for the Campbells...
Where are these exactly?
It's a movie theater, no bad seats... the Cosgroves, and Joey, Stan, Danny... $10 each.
How come we have to pay when everyone knows damn well they were free?
You're such a Jew.
Your friends in Hollywood know you talk that way?
And let me tell you- you're the Jew, trying to make 30 bucks on something you got for free.
25 on Clay by a knockout.
Liston is favored for a reason.
- Cassius Clay is scared.
- Of what, pray tell?
He had an elevated heart rate before the last fight.
Who says that means you're scared?
It happens to me all the time.
It runs in my family.
Liston has the weight.
And he's never been knocked out.
Sonny's old.
He's experienced.
Don, I've got your ticket.
You want to put something down?
Stan's got a barber who makes book.
Yeah, who do you like?
I was just saying
I think Clay'd make one hell of an adman.
You're right.
Gimme 100 on Liston.
Joining us for a little pre-fight steak and cocktails at the palm?
Absolutely.
Samsonite team, in my office.
Listen, if it comes up with Jennifer,
I did pay for the seats.
Can you make a dinner reservation before the bout for Mr. Sterling and me anywhere but the palm?
I don't know why everyone cares so much about it.
If I wanted to see two negroes fight,
I'd throw a dollar bill out my window.
I thought we were doing this at 9:00.
It's 11:15.
I'm late, but you're not.
Good work so far.
- Where do you want me?
- Behind the desk is fine.
You're in a white studio, like in some limbo.
There's two no-name football players holding an American tourister and a skyway going against Mr. Joe Namath and his defender, a sexy girl holding a samsonite, and maybe a referee.
So we hear "hut hut, hike!" Namath fades back.
"Oh no, it's a blitz!"... punch in on Namath, he says something like...
"The secret to victory on the road is samsonite.
I carry it because it's tough and no matter what comes at me, I know I'm protected."
As they fall, the competitors will bust open, clothing flying out.
Touchdown, samsonite!
- "I've got it, honey." - "You sure do, Joe."
"Samsonite... it's tough."
Endorsements are lazy, and I don't like Joe Namath.
He hasn't even played in a professional game yet.
He's very handsome.
And women don't buy suitcases.
Dr. faye says they do.
Could you leave us, please?
Peggy, I'm glad that this is an environment where you feel free to fail.
You wanted to go with Danny's idea.
Because it works...
"only samsonite is tough."
It's the execution that's the problem.
- Okay, should it be funny?
- Actually funny?
Maybe.
Funny like what I just saw?
No.
- Hello.
- You remembered my birthday.
Did you open my present?
I am.
Hold on.
My goodness.
I'm finally doing what I should've done years ago.
Phillips-Olson- something probably, but I'll need you.
I want to form an agency that specializes in women's products with you as my creative director.
I don't know what to say.
But you're smiling, right?
I have some very- sort of a little under the table, but very high-level talks with the people at tampax.
Peggy, it's tampax- 50% market share.
I mean they're really up there.
Plus that queer at belle jolie has been barking up my tree.
Plus I have my European connections.
It sounds exciting.
The train's leaving the station, honey.
Get onboard.
Where am I calling you?
I'm in my office at home.
So you already told grey?
I'm not wasting my talents over there anymore.
Believe me, it was mutual.
Duck, did you lose your job?
Peggy, this is good.
I'm not gonna lie.
I was a little inspired by what Draper did.
Now I just need some accounts.
It's tough because, well... it's tough to get a credit line.
So what do you have so far?
I know it's not a diamond necklace, but I did spend some money on those cards.
And I appreciate the gesture.
It's just...
I don't know whether to take this seriously, because I suspect you've been drinking.
Well, you're wrong.
I heard about the Clios.
I have to see you tonight.
I have plans.
What, with that Mark?
He's another one.
Duck, you are a valuable account man.
You have a bright future.
You just need to go to one of those headhunters and...
- I need to see you, babe.
- Don't do that.
Peg, I'm falling apart.
Don't you know you're the last thing that made me feel good about myself?
Pull your hands out of your panties.
I can't talk right now....
I want to see you tonight.
You been farting in here?
...
I have to go.
We're going to lunch.
I don't know if you could tell, but he hated it.
I was hating it too while we were doing it, but not before.
I'm not gonna lie.
So we're back to the drawing board.
Still gotta eat.
Come on, it's your birthday.
We'll let you talk through lunch.
You got a call while you were in the toilet to the direct line...
Stephanie from California, no last name.
She says it's urgent.
- Would you like me to place the call?
- No, I've got it.
Bad news.
Our night is ruined.
I took care of that.
The kids are going to the palm.
We are going anywhere else.
Well, the brotherhood of alcoholics anonymous...
Freddy and Cal Rutledge from Pond's... will be joining us for dinner and the fight, which means we'll have to drink before dinner if we want to drink at all.
And then there's all the talk about drinking where they start with the funny stories and they end up crying.
Again.
15 months I've been waiting for this fight.
$300.
Liston has to lose by unconsciousness.
- Get rid of 'em.
- I can't.
- I should work on samsonite.
- That's in two weeks.
I'm gonna be in Florida.
Now this is your job too.
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry.
You can do that without me.
- Samsonite you can't.
- Are you serious?
We can solve this problem with a flask.
No, I wouldn't be good company anyway.
That's never bothered me before.
I don't know what it is, but I look at the side of your neck and I wish I had one of those James Bond pens so I could jam a dart in it.
James Bond likes to travel.
He goes all over the world.
He goes underwater.
He met a girl underwater.
I think this is a good place to stop.
See you tomorrow.
Oh, great.
I don't like sitting at my desk and looking into a garbage dump.
Although I am paid less, I am still not a janitor.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Doing something special for your birthday?
Mark is taking me to dinner... the forum of the twelve caesars.
- Ooh.
- Yes.
- How old are you?
- 26 today.
Well, you're doing all right, aren't you?
Well, hello.
- Did I hear it's your birthday?
- It is.
- How are you feeling?
- Well, of course my days are spent sleeping and visiting the ladies' room, although it's an incredible feeling having this baby kick me.
Is it any different than living with Pete?
You're witty.
I always assumed that, but it turns out it's true.
Are you going to watch the fight?
Oh, yes.
I've been watching boxing since I was a little girl.
My father loves blood sport.
Mr. Draper's looking for you.
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
Happy Birthday.
You know, 26 is still very young.
Have fun.
I want a rare steak and I want to see those two men pound each other.
Cynthia's at the restaurant.
We should go.
What about Jennifer?
Oh, don't go in there.
Don't do it.
- She's dead.
- Let's beat it before it's us.
- I was just on my way out.
- Did you get California?
Do you want me to try before I depart?
There's a time difference, you know.
I do, but it goes the other way.
Good night, Mr. Draper.
Get in here.
Why don't you talk to Joan and get rid of her?
No, Joan knew exactly what I needed and made sure that I got it.
So where are we on samsonite?
We'll have something to show you in the morning.
But the suspense is killing me.
Well, I kind of was on my way out.
Let me just see where we are.
I guess I've got a minute.
Okay.
We thought that samsonite is this very rare element, this mythical substance, the hardest on earth- and we see an adventurer leaping through a cave.
Is this a substance much like bullshit?
I thought we could drop one off the eiffel tower with a countdown- like the moonshot... and show how it doesn't break.
- But it would, wouldn't it?
- Probably.
The government has prohibited us from doing things like that, Peggy.
They feel that it is not in the public interest.
We have a thing with samson, because he's strong... and his hair.
I gave you more responsibility and you didn't do anything?
That you like.
We did work... a lot.
I don't care if you work 10 seconds if you bring me something I like.
We're going to do this right now.
Oh, I know you have plans.
You were going to call me from a bar with an idea?
Do you think elves do this?
You're just gonna change it anyway.
Excuse me?
!
- This is Mark Kerney.
- I am so sorry.
I got drawn into his web.
It's gonna be a while.
A while like soon, or a while like I should cancel?
15 minutes?
It shouldn't take too long.
- He's going to the boxing match.
- He's going to Maine?
You can watch it on closed-circuit TV in the movie theaters.
We got tickets.
How come we didn't go?
Because we're having a romantic dinner for my birthday.
Well, did you tell him that?
Look, I'm the only one who can help him with this and the sooner I get off the phone, the sooner I can come.
Just hurry, will you?
She's gonna be a few minutes late.
A surprise on top of a surprise.
She works too hard.
"The oysters of Hercules, which you with sword shall carve."
I saw a tray pass by.
They look like hockey pucks.
$1.65.
You should let Gerry get this.
Mom, don't cut the kid off at the knees.
Now what if an elephant either sits on or steps on the suitcase?
How about a slow-moving airplane runs it over?
Do you like Cassius Clay?
- He's very handsome.
- I don't think so.
You're not supposed to.
I remember my mother talking about nat king Cole in a way that made my father throw out all his records.
He's got a big mouth.
"I'm the greatest." " Not if you have to say it."
Muhammad Ali.
Do you like the airplane?
Liston just goes about his business, works methodically.
Clay will dance and talk, throw a few until he's wiped out.
A bag under an airplane looks like there's been an accident.
Three classes of suitcase... featherweight, middleweight, heavyweight... for whatever class you're in.
But how do you do that on TV?
- What's the story?
- You don't like it?
No, I love it.
That's great.
That's what we should do.
Let it ring.
I'll say you're not here.
Hello?
Oh hello, Roger.
No, he's not here.
I answer other people's phones all the time.
I'm going to count to three, then I'm gonna start saying a lot of words you don't like, sweetheart.
- This should be good.
- I'm begging you...
Get down here right away.
You think I'd rather be working?
Yeah, I do.
Did you know
Freddy Rumsen collects Indian arrowheads?
Where are you?
There's a bar next to Keenes.
I've been sneaking off to fortify myself.
Tell 'em you're sick.
Go home.
I am sick.
I think I overdid it.
And they're self-so-righteous.
I never pissed my pants.
This guy Rutledge killed a man with a motorboat.
You know what gets you over something like that?
Drinking.
Still got your ticket.
It's an attractive offer.
Look out your window.
Can you see me?
Good night, sweetheart.
Go ahead.
I'll wait.
- Hello.
- 15 minutes?
It's almost an hour.
I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna leave any minute.
Did you at least have something?
You have to get down here.
You have to get down here right away.
I can't just leave, okay?
But you have to, okay?
You know what?
Just go to my apartment and wait for me.
We can eat there another time.
No, I don't want to do that.
- I'll make it worth your while.
- Damn it, Peggy.
I've got your whole family here for a surprise dinner, okay?
And the only way you can make it worse is by not coming at all.
Oh, Mark.
I'm so sorry.
I'm coming right now.
Thank you.
Well, so much for the surprise.
Okay, I'm going to leave if that's all right with you.
I'm not so sure about it.
I mean every time we get into this, we abandon the toughness idea.
Maybe there's something to the elephant.
Do you want one?
I'm sorry.
Do you have someplace to be?
Maybe tap your foot so I get the message.
I was supposed to be at dinner an hour ago.
It's my birthday, and I'm pretty sure
I ruined everything.
- Why the hell didn't you tell me?
- I don't know.
Because I thought this would take a second.
So now I'm supposed to feel like crap?
Oh, I'm so sick that I ruined her birthday.
Do you know when my birthday is?
- I was your secretary!
- Well, enjoy your evening!
By the way, you are 20-something years old.
It's time to get over birthdays.
Go ahead.
I'll do it myself.
Yes, I'm that important.
So the fact that you're calling means that you haven't left yet.
I'm not gonna be able to make it at all.
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm sorry, but no one asked you to do this.
You said you never had a surprise.
I can't believe you.
This is your mother speaking.
Hello, ma.
I just want you to know that we're all here...
Me, Anita, Gerry, the roommate... and we're not leaving until you march in here.
I can't, okay?
Could you put Mark on the phone?
He's crestfallen, you know?
- Mrs. Olson, it's okay.
- It's not okay.
Now he's making excuses for you.
I don't know how many nice boys you think are lining up for you.
You should be grateful.
Okay, goodbye.
- Hello?
- I'm sorry I ruined this and I'm sorry you had to spend the evening with my mother.
You know what?
She's right.
Really?
Then why don't you date her?
She's never even had a job.
How the hell are you mad at me?
Because you used my birthday to get in good with a bunch of people who drive me crazy.
Should I have invited don?
You never stand him up.
What's the point of doing anything nice for you?
Jesus.
You even sound like my mother.
I'm already into this place for $40.
If you don't mind, I'm going to enjoy my dinner and you enjoy your work.
The fact that you would stay there... you know what?
- Forget it.
- No.
What?
You want to do this right now?
- Do what?
- Fine.
It's been nice knowing you.
Happy Birthday.
- So that's it?
- Yup.
Good night.
Hello?
It'll be fine.
Couples fight.
Ask Gerry.
What's wrong?
Elevator out?
I think I just broke up with Mark.
Oh.
Really?
...
I think so.
So go home.
Nope.
I'm ready to work.
You win.
Again.
You could've just told me it was your birthday.
Right, and there'd be no repercussions.
- So now this is my fault?
- Well, it's not my fault you don't have a family, friends or anywhere else to go.
Go.
Go.
Run to him like in the movies.
- You don't have to be here.
- I do have to be here because of some stupid idea from Danny who you had to hire because you stole his other stupid idea because you were drunk.
Don't get personal because you didn't do your work.
And by the way, I know it kills you, but guess what:
There is no "Danny's idea."
Everything that comes in here belongs to the agency.
You mean you.
- As long as you still work here.
- Is that a threat?
Because I've already taken somebody up on one of those tonight.
- Relax.
- You know what?
Here's a blank piece of paper.
Why don't you turn that into glo-coat?
Are you out of your mind?
You gave me 20 ideas and I picked out one of them that was a kernel that became that commercial.
- So you remember.
- I do.
It was something about a cowboy.
Congratulations.
No, it was something about a kid locked in a closet because his mother was making him wait for the floor to dry, which is basically the whole commercial.
- It's a kernel.
- Which you changed just enough
- so that it was yours.
- I changed it into a commercial.
What, are we going to shoot him in the dark in the closet?
That's the way it works.
There are no credits on commercials.
- But you got the clio!
- It's your job!
I give you money, you give me ideas.
And you never say thank you.
That's what the money is for!
You're young.
You will get your recognition.
And honestly, it is absolutely ridiculous to be two years into your career and counting your ideas.
Everything to you is an opportunity.
And you should be thanking me every morning when you wake up, along with Jesus, for giving you another day!
Oh, come on.
I'm sorry about your boyfriend, okay?
May 25th.
Ideas for samsonite.
Toughness means that......
Peggy, get in here.
- No.
- Come on.
You have to come in here right now.
What do you want?
You have to hear this.
Sit down.
Come on.
Sit.
So this is tape #4 of "Sterling's gold," by Roger Sterling.
So where was I?
Burt Cooper hated me and I thought it was because he thought I'd be an ally of my father,
but it turned out it was something to do with my joie de vivre,
My romantic prowess...
See tape #3...
Including some time with the queen of perversions, his secretary Ida Blankenship.
You know what?
Don't use her name.
But it was all about him hating my very youth, all because the poor guy had been cut down in the height of his sexual prime by an unnecessary orchiectomy.
Lyle Evans, M.D.
I think he had him killed.
Anyway, sometime in the summer of '48...
No, 1932...
No, 1939.
Why are you laughing?
It's like reading someone's diary.
Come on.
Ida was a hellcat?
Cooper lost his balls?
Roger's writing a book?
I should go.
- Stay and visit.
- I've got nothing to say.
- Sure you do.
- No, it's personal.
We have personal conversations.
No, we don't, and I think you like it that way.
I know I do.
Suit yourself.
We're supposed to be staring at each other over candlelight and he invites my mother?
He doesn't know me.
It's not my fault.
I guess I'm back to square one.
Single.
Well, as Danny would say, there's no use crying over fish in the sea.
Mouse!
Over there!
- What are you doing?
- Get the suitcase.
- Why?
- I'm gonna seal it up in my nice samsonite
- and throw it off the roof.
- Don't.
Come on.
Every idea you have is some version of that.
Let's do it.
Where'd you go, Mickey?
- I think it's a rat.
- It's a mouse.
I grew up on a farm.
You know what?
There's a way out of this room we don't know about.
Are you okay?
I think that's yours.
It's probably Mark.
I don't want to answer it.
It's still your birthday.
Let me get you dinner.
What's the most exciting thing about a suitcase?
Going somewhere.
The acropolis.
I'd like to go to Greece.
I heard all the good cooks stayed there.
I'd like to just go on a plane.
I've never been.
- Is that right?
- I've heard about it, obviously.
I've seen it in the movies.
It's an incredible idea... flying.
I remember on the way to Korea they told us how many thousand feet in the air we were.
There was some other kid there... more of a yokel than me, even... and he screamed, "man wasn't meant to fly!"
Cooper has no testicles?
Ick.
I don't want water.
My uncle Max said he had a suitcase that was always packed.
He said, "a man has to be ready to go at any moment."
Jesus.
Maybe it's a metaphor.
There's something to that idea.
I don't know.
I can't tell the difference anymore between something that's good and something that's awful.
Well, they're very close.
But the best idea always wins and you'll know it when you see it.
Keep banging your head against the wall then it happens.
And then it's done.
Yes, ma'am.
Not like everything else in my life.
I mean, I know what I'm supposed to want, but it just never feels right...
Or as important as anything in that office.
- I didn't know you were in Korea.
- Very briefly.
Did you shoot anybody?
Nope.
I saw some people get killed.
That's memorable.
My father died right in front of me...
Heart attack.
I was 12.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It was pretty violent.
The TV was on.
That's why I hate sports.
Nobody was around...
Saturday afternoon.
My mother was shopping.
I saw my father die too.
He was kicked by a horse....
You're kidding.
- What about your mother?
- I never knew her.
Why is there a dog in the Parthenon?
That is a roach.
Let's go someplace darker.
I hate dating.
I'm terrible at it.
You'll find someone.
You know you're cute as hell.
Men don't exactly stop and stare in the streets.
Do you want that?
That's not what you were supposed to say.
What do you care what I think?
Well, everybody thinks I slept with you to get the job.
They joke about it, like it's so funny because the possibility was so remote.
It's not because you aren't attractive.
I have to keep rules about work.
I have to.
You're an attractive girl, Peggy.
Not as attractive as some of your other secretaries,
I guess.
You don't want to start giving me morality lessons, do you?
People do things, right?
My mother thinks you were responsible, because you were the only person who visited me in the hospital.
Jesus.
Really?
She hates you.
Do you know who it was?
Of course I do.
Do you ever think about it?
I try not to...
But then it comes up out of nowhere.
Playgrounds.
Get up!
Get up!
- Come on!
Get up!
- Get up!
- Come on, get up!
- Get up.
- Come on.
- Come on, get up!
Get up!
Get up!
- Come on, get up!
- Come on, get up!
Get up!
Get up, bum!
- Come on.
- It's a fix.
- The fix is in.
- What happened?
- It's over.
- Already?
Who won?
- Clay.
- Don't believe that for a second.
No one goes down like that.
That's what the man just said.
Some fight.
I lost 100 bucks in two minutes.
Let's go back, pack up and go home.
Damn elevator's like a rocket.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Are you okay?
Do you want any water?
What?
I have toothpaste and a toothbrush in my desk.
Peggy?
...
- Peggy.
- I'll be right back.
Peggy?
Duck?
What are you doing?
Leaving Draper a little present.
Don't!
That's disgusting.
Would you let me concentrate?
This is Roger's office.
Now come one.
Pull up your pants.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Baby.
Baby, I need you so bad.
You wouldn't answer your phone and your roommate said you were still at work.
Why didn't you answer the phone, Peewee?
What's going on?
Just go lay down.
You don't belong in here.
So, Peggy, I see you're not alone.
I guess when screwing me couldn't get you anything, you had to go back to Draper.
- Duck, let's go.
- No.
That's right.
We were in love.
Turns out she's just another whore.
Hey!
Jesus!
Would you stop?
!
Stop it!
You're both drunk!
You know, I killed 17 men at Okinawa.
Uncle.
What the hell is wrong with you?
You still think you're better than me?
Come on, Peggy.
Let's go.
I got rid of him.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Are you?
I, uh...
I never thought...
I'm so sorry.
I... you know what?
I don't know why I was with him.
- It was a confusing time.
- Stop.
You don't have to explain.
Can you get me a drink?
How long are you gonna go on like this?
I have to make a phone call and I know it's going to be bad, okay?
Oh.
Do you want to be alone?
Just make me a drink.
Sorry if I embarrassed you.
- Hello.
- It's me.
She's gone.
I know.
She wanted you to know.
I'm sorry I didn't call.
I was... did she want to talk to me?
You know, she wasn't really there.
I'm coming out.
I'll make the arrangements.
No need.
She left her body to science.
She said that she wanted to go to U.C.L.A. Medical school tuition-free.
Of course she did.
I'm coming out.
I'll take care of the house.
I'd like to stay here if that's okay with you, take some time off from school.
Of course.
That's fine.
She's in a better place.
That's what they say.
It's late and it's been a long day.
Okay.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Stephanie.
What happened?
Somebody very important to me died.
Who?
The only person in the world who really knew me.
That's not true.
You should go home.
You can come in late.
I'll be fine.
I'm so sorry.
Good night.
Drop and give me 20.
You asshole.
Get to work.
It's 10:30, maggot.
- Oh.
- Did you spend the night here?
- Yeah.
- See the fight?
No.
90 seconds of boxing and three hours of analysis.
- And we still don't know who won.
- Clay won.
Read the paper.
Come in.
You look fresh.
Did you go home?
I spruced up.
Come over here.
Look at this.
I think you have to know the photo.
It's on the front page of every paper.
It's historic.
How do we know it's the tourister that got knocked out?
Because the slogan will say so.
How do you put it on TV?
Are they animated?
Why are you shitting on this?
I'm tired.
It's good.
It's very good.
Give it to Joey...
No, Stan...
Then go home, shower, then come back and give me 10 tag lines.
Okay.
Open or closed?
Open.
...five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.
-Two for the Campbells,
-Where are these exactly?
It's a movie theater, no bad seats.
The Cosgroves, and Joey, Stan, Danny, $10 each.
How come we have to pay when everyone knows damn well they were free?
You're such a Jew.
Your friends in Hollywood know you talk that way?
And let me tell you, you're the Jew, trying to make 30 bucks on something you got for free.
Twenty-five on Clay by a knockout.
Liston is favored for a reason.
Cassius Clay is scared.
Of what, pray tell?
He had an elevated heart rate before the last fight.
Who says that means you're scared?
It happens to me all the time, it runs in my family.
Liston has the weight and he's never been knocked out.
Sonny's old.
He's experienced.
Don, I've got your ticket.
You want to put something down?
Stan's got a barber who makes book.
Yeah, who do you like?
I was just saying I think Clay'd make one hell of an adman.
You're right.
Give me 100 on Liston.
Joining us for a little pre-fight steak and cocktails at The Palm?
Absolutely.
Samsonite team, in my office.
Listen, if it comes up with Jennifer, I did pay for the seats.
Can you make a dinner reservation before the bout for Mr. Sterling and me anywhere but The Palm?
I don't know why everyone cares so much about it.
If I wanted to see two Negroes fight, I'd throw a dollar bill out my window.
I thought we were doing this at 9:00.
it's 11:15.
I'm late, but you're not.
Good work so far.
Where do you want me?
Behind the desk is fine.
You're in a white studio, like in some limbo.
There's two no-name football players holding an American Tourister and a Skyway going against Mr. Joe Namath and his defender, a sexy girl holding a Samsonite, and maybe a referee.
So, we hear, "Hut, hut, hike!" Namath fades back.
"Oh, no, it's a blitz!"
Punch in on Namath, he says something like...
"The secret to victory on the road is Samsonite.
"I carry it because it's tough,
"and no matter what comes at me, I know I'm protected."
As they fall, the competitors will bust open, clothing flying out.
Touchdown, Samsonite!
-I got it, honey.
-You sure do, Joe.
"Samsonite It's tough
Endorsements are lazy, and I don't like Joe Namath.
He hasn't even played in a professional game yet.
He's very handsome.
And women don't buy suitcases.
Dr. Faye says they do.
Could you leave us, please?
Peggy, I'm glad that this is an environment where you feel free to fail.
You wanted to go with Danny's idea.
Because it works.
"Only Samsonite is tough." It's the execution that's the problem.
Okay, should it be funny?
Actually funny?
Maybe.
Funny like what I just saw?
No.
Hello.
You remembered my birthday.
Did you open my present?
I am.
Hold on.
My goodness.
I'm finally doing what I should've done years ago.
Phillips-Olson something probably, but I'll need you.
I want to form an agency that specializes in women's products with you as my creative director.
I don't know what to say.
But you're smiling, right?
I have some very...
It's sort of a little under the table, but very high-level talks with the people at Tampax.
Peggy, it's Tampax, 50% market share.
I mean they're really up there.
Plus that queer at Belle Jolie has been barking up my tree.
Plus I have my European connections.
It sounds exciting.
The train's leaving the station, honey.
Get on board.
Where am I calling you?
I'm in my office at home.
So, you already told Grey?
I'm not wasting my talents over there anymore.
Believe me, it was mutual.
Duck, did you lose your job?
Peggy, this is good.
I'm not gonna lie.
I was a little inspired by what Draper did.
Now I just need some accounts.
It's tough because, well...
It's tough to get a credit line.
So, what do you have so far?
I know it's not a diamond necklace, but I did spend some money on those cards.
And I appreciate the gesture.
It's just...
I don't know whether to take this seriously because I suspect you've been drinking.
Well, you're wrong.
I heard about the CLIOs.
I have to see you tonight.
I have plans.
What, with that Mark?
He's another one.
Duck, you are a valuable account man.
You have a bright future.
You just need to go to one of those headhunters and...
I need to see you, babe.
Don't do that.
Peg, I'm falling apart.
Don't you know you're the last thing that made me feel good about myself?
Pull your hands out of your panties.
I can't talk right now.
I want to see you tonight.
You been farting in here?
I have to go.
We're going to lunch.
I don't know if you could tell, but he hated it.
I was hating it too while we were doing it, but not before.
I'm not gonna lie.
So, we're back to the drawing board.
Still gotta eat.
Come on, it's your birthday.
We'll let you talk through lunch.
You got a call while you were in the toilet to the direct line.
Stephanie from California, no last name.
She says it's urgent.
Would you like me to place the call?
No, I've got it.
Bad news.
Our night is ruined.
I took care of that.
The kids are going to The Palm.
We are going anywhere else.
Well, the brotherhood of Alcoholics Anonymous,
Freddy and Cal Rutledge from Pond's will be joining us for dinner and the fight, which means we'll have to drink before dinner, if we want to drink at all.
And then there's all the talk about drinking, where they start with the funny stories and they end up crying.
Again.
Fifteen months I've been waiting for this fight.
$300.
Liston has to lose by unconsciousness.
-Get rid of 'em.
-I can't.
I should work on Samsonite.
That's in two weeks.
I'm gonna be in Florida.
Now, this is your job too.
Let's go.
I'm sorry.
You can do that without me.
Samsonite you can't.
Are you serious?
We can solve this problem with a flask.
No, I wouldn't be good company anyway.
That's never bothered me before.
I don't know what it is, but I look at the side of your neck and I wish I had one of those James Bond pens so I could jam a dart in it.
James Bond likes to travel.
He goes all over the world.
He goes underwater.
He met a girl underwater.
I think this is a good place to stop.
See you tomorrow.
Great.
I don't like sitting at my desk and looking into a garbage dump.
Although I am paid less, I am still not a janitor.
Thank you, gentlemen.
-Doing something special for your birthday?
-Mark is taking me to dinner.
The Forum of the Twelve Caesars.
Yes.
How old are you?
Twenty-six, today.
You're doing all right, aren't you?
Well, hello.
Did I hear it's your birthday?
It is.
How are you feeling?
Well, of course my days are spent sleeping and visiting the ladies' room, although it's an incredible feeling having this baby kick me.
Is it any different than living with Pete?
You're witty.
I always assumed that, but it turns out it's true.
Are you going to watch the tight?
Yes.
I've been watching boxing since I was a little girl.
My father loves blood sport.
Mr. Draper's looking for you.
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
Happy birthday.
You know, 26 is still very young.
Have fun.
I want a rare steak, and I want to see those two men pound each other.
Cynthia's at the restaurant.
We should go.
What about Jennifer?
Don't go in there.
Don't do it.
-She's dead.
-Let's beat it before it's us.
-I was just on my way out.
-Did you get California?
Do you want me to try before I depart?
There's a time difference, you know.
I do, but it goes the other way.
Good night, Mr. Draper.
Get in here.
Why don't you talk to Joan and get rid of her?
No, Joan knew exactly what I needed and made sure that I got it.
So, where are we on Samsonite?
We'll have something to show you in the morning.
But the suspense is killing me.
Well, I kind of was on my way out.
Let me just see where we are.
I guess I've got a minute.
Okay.
We thought that Samsonite is this very rare element, this mythical substance, the hardest on earth, and we see an adventurer leaping through a cave.
Is this a substance much like bullshit?
I thought we could drop one off the Eiffel Tower, with a countdown, like the moon shot and show how it doesn't break.
-But it would, wouldn't it?
-Probably.
The government has prohibited us from doing things like that, Peggy.
They feel that it is not in the public interest.
We have a thing with Samson, because he's strong and his hair.
I gave you more responsibility and you didn't do anything?
That you like.
We did work.
A lot.
I don't care if you work 10 seconds if you bring me something I like.
We're going to do this right now.
I Know you have plans.
You were going to call me from a bar with an idea?
You think elves do this?
You're just gonna change it anyway.
Excuse me?
This is Mark Kerney.
I am so sorry.
I got drawn into his web.
It's gonna be a while.
A while like soon, or a while like I should cancel?
Fifteen minutes?
It shouldn't take too long.
He's going to the boxing match.
He's going to Maine?
You can watch it on closed-circuit TV in the movie theaters.
We got tickets.
How come we didn't go?
Because we're having a romantic dinner for my birthday.
Well, did you tell him that?
Look, I'm the only one who can help him with this, and the sooner I get off the phone, the sooner I can come.
Just hurry, will you?
She's gonna be a few minutes late.
A surprise on top of a surprise.
She works too hard-
"The Oysters of Hercules, which you with sword shall carve."
I saw a tray pass by.
They look like hockey pucks.
$1.65.
You should let Gerry get this.
Mom, don't cut the kid off at the knees.
Now, what if an elephant either sits on or steps on a suitcase?
How about a slow-moving airplane runs it over?
Do you like Cassius Clay?
He's very handsome.
I don't think so.
You're not supposed to.
I remember my mother talking about Nat King Cole in a way that made my father throw out all his records.
He's got a big mouth.
"I'm the greatest." Not if you have to say it.
Muhammad Ali.
Do you like the airplane?
Liston just goes about his business, works methodically.
Clay will dance and talk, throw a few until he's wiped out.
A bag under an airplane looks like there's been an accident.
Three classes of suitcase.
Featherweight, middleweight, heavyweight.
For whatever class you're in.
But how do you do that on TV?
What's the story?
You don't like it?
No, I love it.
That's great.
That's what we should do.
Let it ring.
I'll say you're not here.
Hello?
Hello, Roger.
No, he's not here.
I answer other people's phones all the time.
I'm going to count to three, then I'm gonna start saying a lot of words you don't like, sweetheart.
This should be good.
I'm begging you, get down here right away.
You think I'd rather be working?
Yeah, I do.
Did you know Freddy Rumsen collects Indian arrowheads?
Where are you?
There's a bar next to Keenes.
I've been sneaking off to fortify myself.
Tell 'em you're sick.
Go home.
I am sick.
I think I overdid it.
And they're self so righteous.
I never pissed my pants.
This guy Rutledge killed a man with a motorboat.
You know what gets you over something like that?
Drinking.
Still got your ticket.
It's an attractive offer.
Look out your window.
Can you see me?
Good night, sweetheart.
Go ahead.
I'll wait.
Hello.
Fifteen minutes?
It's almost an hour.
I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna leave any minute.
Did you at least have something?
You have to get down here.
You have to get down here right away.
I can't just leave, okay?
But you have to, okay?
You know what?
Just go to my apartment and wait for me.
We can eat there another time.
No, I don't want to do that.
I'll make it worth your while.
Damn it, Peggy.
I've got your whole family here for a surprise dinner, okay?
And the only way you can make it worse is by not coming at all.
Mark.
I'm so sorry.
I'm coming right now.
Thank you.
Well, so much for the surprise.
Okay, I'm going to leave if that's all right with you.
I'm not so sure about it.
I mean every time we get into this, we abandon the toughness idea.
Maybe there's something to the elephant.
Do you want one?
I'm sorry.
Do you have someplace to be?
Maybe tap your foot so I get the message.
I was supposed to be at dinner an hour ago.
it's my birthday.
And I'm pretty sure I ruined everything.
Why the hell didn't you tell me?
I don't know.
Because I thought this would take a second.
So, now I'm supposed to feel like crap?
"I'm so sick that I ruined her birthday." Do you know when my birthday is?
I was your secretary.
Well, enjoy your evening!
By the way, you are 20-something years old.
it's time to get over birthdays.
Go ahead.
I'll do it myself.
Yes, I'm that important.
So, the fact that you're calling means you haven't left yet.
I'm not gonna be able to make it at all.
Are you kidding me?
I'm sorry, but no one asked you to do this.
You said you never had a surprise.
I can't believe you.
This is your mother speaking.
Hello, Ma.
I just want you to know that we're all here.
Me, Anita, Gerry, the roommate, and we're not leaving until you march in here.
I can't, okay?
Could you put Mark on the phone?
He's crestfallen, you know?
-Mrs.
Olson, it's okay.
-It's not okay.
Now he's making excuses for you.
I don't know how many nice boys you think are lining up for you.
You should be grateful.
Okay, goodbye.
Hello?
I'm sorry I ruined this, and I'm sorry you had to spend the evening with my mother.
You know what?
She's right.
Really?
Then why don't you date her?
She's never even had a job.
How the hell are you mad at me?
Because you used my birthday to get in good with a bunch of people who drive me crazy.
Should I have invited Don?
You never stand him up.
What's the point of doing anything nice for you?
Jesus.
You even sound like my mother.
I'm already into this place for $40.
If you don't mind, I'm going to enjoy my dinner, and you enjoy your work.
The fact that you would stay there...
You know what?
Forget it.
No.
What?
You want to do this right now?
Do what?
Fine. it's been nice knowing you.
Happy birthday.
So, that's it?
Yup.
Good night.
Hello?
It'll be fine.
Couples fight.
Ask Gerry.
What's wrong?
Elevator out?
I think I just broke up with Mark.
Really?
I think so.
So, go home.
Nope.
I'm ready to work.
You win.
Again.
You could've just told me it was your birthday.
Right, and there'd be no repercussions.
So, now this is my fault?
Well, it's not my fault you don't have a family, or friends, or anywhere else to go.
Go.
Go.
Run to him like in the movies.
You don't have to be here.
I do have to be here because of some stupid idea from Danny who you had to hire because you stole his other stupid idea because you were drunk.
Don't get personal because you didn't do your work.
And by the way, I know it kills you, but guess what?
There is no Danny's idea.
Everything that comes in here belongs to the agency.
You mean you.
As long as you still work here.
Is that a threat?
Because I've already taken somebody up on one of those tonight.
Relax.
You know what?
Here's a blank piece of paper.
Why don't you turn that into Glo-Coat?
Are you out of your mind?
You gave me 20 ideas and I picked out one of them that was a kernel that became that commercial.
So, you remember.
I do.
It was something about a cowboy.
Congratulations.
No, it was something about a kid locked in a closet because his mother was making him wait for the floor to dry, which is basically the whole commercial.
It's a kernel.
Which you changed just enough so that it was yours.
I changed it into a commercial.
What, are we going to shoot him in the dark in the closet?
That's the way it works.
There are no credits on commercials.
But you got the CLIO!
It's your job!
I give you money, you give me ideas.
And you never say thank you.
That's what the money is for!
You're young.
You will get your recognition.
And honestly, it is absolutely ridiculous to be two years into your career and counting your ideas.
Everything to you is an opportunity.
And you should be thanking me every morning when you wake up, along with Jesus, for giving you another day!
Come on.
I'm sorry about your boyfriend, okay?
May 25th.
Ideas for Samsonite.
Toughness means that...
Peggy, get in here.
-No.
-Come on.
You have to come in here right now.
What do you want?
You have to hear this.
Sit down.
Come on.
Sit.
So, this is tape number 4 of Sterling's Gold by Roger Sterling.
So, where was I?
Bert Cooper hated me and I thought it was because he thought I 'd be an ally of my father;
but it turned out it was something to do with my joie de vivre, my romantic prowess.
See tape 3.
Including some time with the queen of perversions, his secretary Ida Blankenship.
You know what?
Don't use her name.
But it was all about him hating my very youth, all because the poor guy had been out down in the height of his sexual prime by an unnecessary orchiectomy.
Lyle Evans, M. D. I think he had him killed.
Anyway, sometime in the summer of '48...
No, 1932.
NO, 1939.
Why are you laughing?
It's like reading someone's diary.
Come on.
Ida was a hellcat?
Cooper lost his balls?
Roger's writing a book?
-I should go.
-Stay and visit.
I've got nothing to say.
Sure you do.
No, it's personal.
We have personal conversations.
No, we don't, and I think you like it that way.
I know I do.
Suit yourself.
We're supposed to be staring at each other over candlelight, and he invites my mother?
He doesn't know me. it's not my fault.
I guess I'm back to square one.
Single.
Well, as Danny would say, "There's no use crying over fish in the sea."
Mouse!
Over there!
What are you doing?
Get the suitcase.
Why?
I'm gonna seal it up in my nice Samsonite and throw it off the roof.
Don't.
Come on.
Every idea you have is some version of that.
Let's do it.
Where'd you go, Mickey?
I think it's a rat.
It's a mouse.
I grew up on a farm.
You know what?
There's a way out of this room we don't know about.
Are you okay?
I think that's yours.
It's probably Mark.
I don't want to answer it.
It's still your birthday.
Let me get you dinner.
What's the most exciting thing about a suitcase?
Going somewhere.
The Acropolis.
I'd like to go to Greece.
I hear all the good cooks stayed there.
I'd like to just go on a plane.
I've never been.
Is that right?
I've heard about it, obviously.
I've seen it in the movies.
It's an incredible idea, flying.
I remember on the way to Korea they told us how many thousand feet in the air we were.
There was some other kid there, more of a yokel than me, even.
And he screamed, "Man wasn't meant to fly!"
Cooper has no testicles?
I don't want water.
My Uncle Max said he had a suitcase that was always packed.
He said, "A man has to be ready to go at any moment."
Jesus.
Maybe it's a metaphor.
There's something to that idea.
I don't know.
I can't tell the difference anymore between something that's good and something that's awful.
Well, they're very close.
But the best idea always wins and you know it when you see it.
Keep banging your head against the wall, then it happens.
And then it's done.
Yes, ma'am.
Not like everything else in my life.
I mean, I know what I'm supposed to want, but it just never feels right.
Or as important as anything in that office.
-I didn't know you were in Korea.
-Very briefly.
-Did you shoot anybody?
-Nope.
I saw some people get killed.
That's memorable.
My father died right in front of me.
Heart attack.
I was 12.
Sorry to hear that.
It was pretty violent.
The TV was on.
That's why I hate sports.
Nobody was around...
Saturday afternoon.
My mother was shopping.
I saw my father die too.
He was kicked by a horse.
You're kidding.
What about your mother?
I never knew her.
Why is there a dog in the Parthenon?
That is a roach.
Let's go someplace darker.
I hate dating.
I'm terrible at it.
You'll find someone.
You know you're cute as hell.
Men don't exactly stop and stare in the streets.
-Do you want that?
-That's not what you were supposed to say.
What do you care what I think?
Everybody thinks I slept with you to get the job.
They joke about it, like it's so funny because the possibility was so remote.
It's not because you aren't attractive.
I have to keep rules about work.
I have to.
You're an attractive girl, Peggy.
Not as attractive as some of your other secretaries, I guess.
You don't want to start giving me morality lessons, do you?
People do things, right?
My mother thinks you were responsible because you were the only person who visited me in the hospital.
-Jesus.
Really?
-She hates you.
Do you know who it was?
Of course I do.
Do you ever think about it?
I try not to.
But then it comes up out of nowhere.
Playgrounds.
Here's Cassius Clay starting to put up a fight.-.
Get up!
Get up!
Come on!
Get up!
Get up!
-Come on, get up!
-Get up.
Get up!
Get up!
...to the top of the head.
Now, here comes Jersey Joe Walcott, and he says it's all over!
It's a fix.
The fix is in.
-What happened?
-it's over.
-Already?
Who won?
-Clay.
Don't believe that for a second.
No one goes down like that.
That's what the man just said.
Some fight.
I lost 100 bucks in two minutes.
Let's go back, pack up and go home.
Damn elevator's like a rocket.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Are you okay?
Do you want any water?
What?
I have toothpaste and a toothbrush in my desk.
Peggy!
Peggy?
-Peggy?
-I'll be right back.
Peggy?
Duck?
What are you doing?
-Leaving Draper a little present.
-Duck, that's disgusting!
Would you let me concentrate?
This is Roger's office.
Now, come one.
Pull up your pants.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Baby.
Baby, I need you so bad.
You wouldn't answer your phone, and your roommate said you were still at work.
Why didn't you answer the phone, Peewee?
What's going on?
Just go lay down.
You don't belong here.
So, Peggy, I see you're not alone.
I guess when screwing me couldn't get you anything, you had to go back to Draper.
-Duck, let's go.
-No.
That's right.
We were in love.
Turns out she's just another whore.
Hey!
Jesus!
Would you stop!
Stop it!
You're both drunk!
You know, I killed 17 men at Okinawa.
Uncle.
What the hell is wrong with you?
You still think you're better than me?
Come on, Peggy.
Let's go.
I got rid of him.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Are you?
I...
I never thought...
I'm so sorry.
I...
You know what?
I don't know why I was with him.
It was a confusing time.
Stop.
You don't have to explain.
Can you get me a drink?
How long are you gonna go on like this?
I have to make a phone call and I know it's going to be bad, okay?
Do you want to be alone?
Just make me a drink.
Sorry if I embarrassed you.
Hello.
It's me.
She's gone.
I know.
She wanted you to know.
I'm sorry I didn't call.
I was...
Did she want to talk to me?
You know, she wasn't really there.
I'm coming out.
I'll make the arrangements.
No need.
She left her body to science.
She said she wanted to go to UCLA Medical School tuition-free.
Of course she did.
I'm coming out.
I'll take care of the house.
I'd like to stay here if that's okay with you, take some time off from school.
Of course.
That's fine.
She's in a better place.
That's what they say.
It's late and it's been a long day.
Okay.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Stephanie.
What happened?
Somebody very important to me died.
Who?
The only person in the world who really knew me.
That's not true.
You should go home.
You can come in late.
I'll be fine.
I'm so sorry.
Good night.
Drop and give me 20!
You asshole!
Get to work. it's 10:30, maggot.
Did you spend the night here?
Yeah.
See the tight?
No.
Ninety seconds of boxing and three hours of analysis.
And we still don't know who won.
Clay won.
Read the paper.
Come in.
You look fresh.
Did you go home?
I spruced up.
Come over here.
Look at this.
I think you have to know the photo.
It's on the front page of every paper.
It's historic.
How do we know it's the Tourister that got knocked out?
Because the slogan will say so.
How do you put it on TV?
Are they animated?
Why are you shitting on this?
I'm tired.
It's good. it's very good.
Give it to Joey.
No, Stan.
Then go home, shower, and come back and give me 10 tag lines.
Okay.
Open or closed?
Open.

'Nothing to show for meself.
'No master plan.
'Been told I was useless so much I believed it.
'Well, it's time to stop crying into my Ruby Grapefruit Breezers.
'Stuff the knockers, negative fuckers, 'voices in my head saying, "You can't."

Hey, don't take it to heart.
Lads his age can just be sensitive.
Oh, Little man!
What's your sob story?
Oh, he's narky with his mum for dragging him out to put up her posters.
Nice idea, lady.
It's mad, what you think up at three in the morning, when you're doing a feed.
Here, you stick them up.
I'll watch Narky.
Thanks.
What's the matter?
Yes.
Better.
See, I'm not really a witch.
Last five, four, three two and watch out Ricky Hatton!
Allright!
It's like having The Hitman here again.
Give him some stick, Jock, or I'll never hear the last of it.
Give him some stick, Jock, or I'll never hear the last of it.
No, no, Maxine I believe in giving credit where it's due and your man's made great progress.
Of course, that's no good if you can't see a punch coming!
Still throwing the low-blows, Jock?
Amazing what a lick of paint can do.
We're definitely back on our feet so if you don't mind, you can get off my case now, Paddy.
Keep your guard up, Gallagher.
Always.
I didn't know you knew Paddy Maguire.
Oh, yeah.
I've known him since he was a whipper-snapper on the run from Belfast.
Poor bastard never got any prettier.
Everything's all right?
Aye.
One, two, three, see...
Got any kids of your own, Libby?
Got any kids of your own, Libby?
Nah.
But still could, kind of.
It's Frank.
Not so "creative" any more.
Shit.
All the boozing finally had an effect?
No, his stomach's lined with asbestos.
He had the... after Stella.
Frank Gallagher, denying mankind his seed?
I don't think so.
Sadly, it's true.
The most pain he's ever felt.
Should see the scar.
The one from the electric shock to his balls?
Huh?
I've heard the stitches story enough to know he would never let a doctor down there.
You know vasectomies can be reversed.
It's, it's never you know that successfully... you, you hear all sorts of stories...
It's, it's uncomfortable.
More uncomfortable than 100 volts to the knackers?
You never got snipped.
Bastard.
You told me that you couldn't, biologically, so, you know, a moment of compassion, I told you I couldn't.
But we can, artificially.
I froze my eggs, Frank.
They're in a clinic, asking to be fertilised.
And you're going to give me what I want.
Am I, fuck!
Well, I'll just find myself a real man then.
Good luck.
Hey, you don't mess with nature.
Have we learned nothing from Dolly the sheep?

Take some of that out on a bag.
Yeah there's some good joining-up offers.
I'm fine.
I don't need your charity.
He's been like that since we got back.
It's like treading on fucking eggshells here.
Three months till they're past their sell-by date?

What are my options?
And if I don't fertilise or donate?
Right.
I best decide then.
That's why you lifted me earlier!
You can't tell anyone.
This is for me.
I've been short listed.
I just have to get pass the assessment day.
Oh, great.
Well, everything crossed.
Oh, great.
Well, everything crossed.

It took me ages to get over that Jimmy crap and I know he scared the shit out of you when he chased you off the estate.
You can't let it send you under.
The only way to get your confidence back is to learn how to look after yourself, and you can cos Jock makes you feel unbeatable.
Next time some fucker comes at me, or takes the piss,

Golden rule, pick your fights.
I caught the bugger a beauty.
I cut him, too.
He'll be uglier than you in the morning!
Well, if you will walk into doors!
He didn't.
He walked into a jab, from Jock.
You what?
He hit me.
I was defending meself.
He owes me Dad three grand.
I had to give him a warning.
Orders, innit.
You could've said no!
He's an old man!
Tell Paddy to give him more time.

I need your decision, Frank.

I was just checking to see if this clinic's legit.
There's a lot of quacks about, Lib, preying on vulnerable women.

You just want to scramble my eggs!
I...
I don...
Oh!
You've got a family here.
Can't we just make do?

Why do you think I want one of my own?

Sorry, we are trying to resolve this sensibly, as a family.

We're at cease fire.
You're letting them off?
This is the Chatsworth, love.

Long enough to know your ex was talking out of his bum hole last night.
Paddy was just showing off.
He didn't mean any of it.
It still hurt.
He used to love my singing.
Said I had the voice of an angel.
Why care what he thinks?
Can't just stop the habit of a lifetime.
I really think you should enter the show.
No.
Nana's saving all her songs for her new man.
You have the luxury of showing Micky the door.
Not so easy for family.
Did he say why I kicked him out?
Nope.
And seeing him with that face and those bin bags didn't put me in a talky mood.
Jock's a good man, Paddy.
He can't do enough for kids around here, and he lives for that boxing club.
You know nothing about that two-faced cunt.
Just give him another week.
A week?
!
I could give him a lifetime, and he'd still default.
He's shite with money, but he always spends his way out of trouble.
Now, does that seem sensible?
No, it's naive.
He's out of his depth.
Tell him I'll be round tomorrow, with a van, to gut the place.

Then why get into debt?
He said I could pay him back when it was good for me.

That man's always promised me the earth and then let me down.
He said you've got form for throwing money at problems.
This gym always comes first.
Paddy Maguire was my great hope.
He was raw, but as tough as I've ever seen.
He just couldn't be tamed.
His father had just died.
He wanted to fight the world, go out in a blaze of glory, just like him.
And I took that anger and I showed him how to use it, and I made him believe.
But he didn't want to be a fighter.
He just wanted to be feared.
I know exactly what I'm up against, son.
Hey, Ches!
Hey, hey, hey, all right, all right.
Jock,
Ricky Hatton, you still in touch?
Sure, yeah, yeah.
Get him to make an appearance!
We'll sell tickets and clear your debt.
I, I can't ask him to do that.
The lad's got too many commitments.
Jock, stuff pride!
Paddy's going to clear this place out.
Call the Hitman.
I'll do the rest.
Liam, One last piece with your name on it.
I'm wasting away!
Yeah!
Wait, wait.
What can I do?
You're trying too hard to be liked.
Nothing kids hate more.
Thank you, mother.
No, she's right, for once.
Monica felt bad after the first bunk, so she made a bit of an effort to get onside, right?
Yeah, then she fucked off again.
Meaning, Liam's seen it all before.
It's all about trust, yeah?
I've had to earn it, time and again.
Nobody trusts you.
How do I make that happen?
Just stick around.
Just be there for him.
Come on, come on!
Give it up, son.
You'll never make it.
Oh!
That's it!
OK.
Head right.
Head right.
ALL:
Head right.
Extend the ladder.
Well done, Maguire.
Let's go.
Great stuff there, that's it.
Bring your giro money, cos we'll be raffling off fight memorabilia.
How much would you say you loved me?
You want keep going a bit more there, pal.
I spoke to the hospital press officer to make some calls.
It's going out everywhere.
Papers, radio.
Ricky Hatton's coming back to Chatsworth to save his old club.
No way!
Fucking hell.
Quality!
Pint.
Pint.
Sure.
# Chatsworth's burning Chatsworth's burning
# Fetch the engine Fetch the engine
# Fire, fire!
Fire, fire!
# Pour on water Pour on water... #
SCREAMS
Whoooaaa!
Do you think that's funny?
Making me look stupid, in front of all these people?
I'm your son.
Beat my drum, Dad, don't beat me into the fucking ground.
Take your foot off me head.
Have you any idea how much that hurts?
Every time you put me down I bleed.
I've got fucking scars on top of scars, me.
How am I meant to deal with that, eh, Dad?
Be a man and deal with it.
Get him another drink.
You'll pass next time.
Who says I failed?
I'm going to be a fireman.
But you'll always be a bitter cunt.
Deal with that!
Different class, Libby.
Proud to call that breakfast English.
First for you, not burning the rashers.
You need to cut Libby some slack, pal.
Come on, do it for me.
I'd appreciate it.
She's fucking broody, isn't she?
That's disgusting.
All right, easy!
Listen, I'm with you.
I just think that if you were a bit more accepting, she wouldn't be as needy.
Libby.
My guitar.
Would you like a lift to school?
Would you like a lift to school?
In a fucking ice-cream van?
!
I'll walk him in.
Oh, the escort girl?
I could always give it a miss?
No way!
No fucking danger!
OK, Liam.
Apart from jibbing school, what would you prefer?
I'll go on my own.
It's my problem.
Maybe they'll get bored and give up.
Get on.
I'll give you a backy.
Get on.
I'll give you a backy.
Then what, another kicking?
I'm trying to make up for that.
Hurry.
Put your hands round me.
Liam I don't want a wank.
You'll fall off otherwise.
Just don't get your hopes up!
Just don't get your hopes up!
It's not my hopes you need to worry about.
BOYS SHOUT
Left.
Down a bit your end, lan.
Lower, lower.
Lower, lower.
What you trying to say?
!
What you trying to say?
!
It's shit.
You fetch the punters in and leave the look to me.
Oi, you putting this up or what?
Fancy a fuck, skinny boy?
Eh?
(LAUGHS)
You think you're fucking funny?
Ches, just leave it out!
Leave it out!
Ches, just leave it out!
Leave it out!
What you saying?
Do that again, I'll cave your face in!
Do that again, I'll cave your face in!
Walk with me!
Fuck off!
Fuck off!
Carl, don't!
Fuck off!
Carl, don't!
No fighting in here!
What, in a boxing club?
What, in a boxing club?
What the fuck's all the shouting about?
Nothing.
Everything's fine.
I don't want to fight him anyway, he's my best mate.
When all that shit happened, you had them there for ya.
Who did I have?
Me.
I've always got your back, bruv.
Look, we're here for you, Chesney.
Any time.
He had no right having a go at me.
I've never stood in the way of any of my kids.
Never encouraged them either.
Stopped supporting altogether.
D'you even know the meaning of family any more?
There's benefits to having a fireman in the family, though.
We'll pass the health and safety every time.
Bit rich, hitting me with the family stick when you fucked off and we were all over the place.
Fine.
Let's get together later, the lot of us, and you can watch me murder a song in the talent show.
That sound good?
Right.
D'you want the bad news or the bad news?
Right.
D'you want the bad news or the bad news?
Don't start, Micky.
Go on, son.
Give us your assessment.
As your appointed Fire Safety Officer, it is my duty to highlight hazards and make recommendations.
Such as?
Closing down.
The place is a death-trap.
You need to act now or there will be casualties.
You what?
Right.
You've just been promoted to Talent Show Superintendent.
Fix the problems, monitor the acts tonight and then we'll, um...
We'll get you a new tabard.
You've only gone and done it, champ.
Let's wait till the real star shows up, eh?
Ricky's the ultimate showman.
He'll be building anticipation.
I just hope he feels at home in his Hatton Wonderland.
I'll check on Jock.
He's a bag of fucking nerves back there.
Good job you're on the money, eh?
All right, Joe?
Hatton!
Hatton!
(CROWD CHANT) Hatton!
Hatton!
"You're such a chancer.
Just staying one step ahead of everyone else, Karen.
Life's all about making the most of your opportunities.
But how far are you prepared to go, Joe?
You'd take Ricky Hatton?
You'd take Ricky Hatton?
He'd kill you, one punch.
I'm saying, if we met down an alley while he was in between fights...
Bang, bang, bang!
I don't think he'd live with my lightning jab.
Undefeated in the ring.
Undefeated in the ring.
You got sparked out, your last fight.
For money.
If Paddy Maguire says to take a dive, you hit the deck.
Why don't you show this lot that jab?
Exhibition match, till Ricky shows?
Nah, you're all right.
Wuss.
Marquee act, not performing monkey.
I'll do it.
Stick me in the ring.
No.
I'll get one of the members to do it.
No.
I'll get one of the members to do it.
Lan, I can do it.
It's too soon.
There's nobody your standard or weight.
What about him?
What about him?
Nails?
I'll tag-team if you're struggling.
Oh, it's Wales all over again.
BELL RINGS, CROWD CHEERS
Right!
Get in that corner!
You all right?
Yeah?
You sure you're OK?
Yeah?
CHEERING
Woo!
Ricky sends his apologies.
It's nobody's fault.
Ricky sends his apologies.
It's nobody's fault.
Load of bollocks.
Lan...
Jock doesn't even know Hatton.
What?
Lad fought here once as an amateur.
Gobshite's been spinning that story since.
Gobshite's been spinning that story since.
That's rubbish.
I drank with the boy.
Got him a pint to ask to name the gym after him, the fucking user.
What were you thinking, Jock?
Why did you let me go through with it?
I didn't know it was going to get like this, did I?
All this press and the radio.
And you were so up to it, and you'd been so supportive.
I didn't have it in me to let you down!
I didn't have it in me to let you down!
Shite!
You don't care about him.
It's only ever about you, you pathetic fucking traitor.
Paddy, no!
Leave him!
No!
Look, leave him!
He's done.
You've won.
It's over.
I'm going to leave you as you left me - without a hope in the fucking world!
This is it, Maguire.
Pass this, you're one of us.
Come on, mate.
Fucking show 'em.
DOOR SLAMS
What's going on?
What's going on?
It's all part of the test.
Working in confined spaces, go on.
'Are you stuck there son, hmmm?
Struggling?
'
Oh, he's gone.
Get out of my head.
If you're in difficulty, raise your hand.
(FATHER'S VOICE MUFFLED) Raise your hand.
(TO HIMSELF) Just stay calm and you're in.
You're running out of time, Maguire.
'Daddy's here, 'just say the word.'
You can do this.
Believe.
MUSIC PLAYS
Why is your dad so fucking bitter?
We need more people like you to stand up to the fucker.
It's not worth it.
There'll only ever be one winner.
Says the trainee fireman?
APPLAUSE
They're rubbish compared to you.
Popular, though.
We all loved Feral.
Give them some competition.
Make yourself popular.
If I did it my way, I'd get destroyed.
Crap.
It's OK to dance differently.
But what did the judges think?
A trillion percent yes!
That's what this competition is all about.
Thank you, Patty.
Just be who you are.
OK, here is Flame Phil.
Woo-ha!
Was it good, then?
Making Jock suffer?
Why even give him a loan if you hate his guts and knew he'd default on it?
Lan, how do you think lenders make money?
By making a fucking killing out of failure.
Yeah, well, you'd know all about that, wouldn't you?
Sorry?
You enjoy watching people fuck up.
You pick on them till they do.
I think you do it to feel better about yourself.
Walk away, lan.
While you can.
How much for that boxing gear?
What?
What?
I'll buy it back off ya.
Let it go, son.
You don't have that kind of money.
A grand.
It's worth treble.
It's worth treble.
And it's used. 1,500.
Why the fuck are you doing this?
I want to keep the boxing club open.
It might not have suited you, but it's been good to me.
Is that what you heard?
Is that what Jock told you - it didn't suit me?
Yeah.
Cos you never wanted to fight fair.
You'll be pouring it down the drain.
That club's jinxed.
(AUDIENCE) Woo!
Jock doesn't deserve a fucking lifeline.
I'm not doing it for him.
I'm doing it for lads like me.
CROWD APPLAUDS

Thanks, Micky.
Sorry about that.
Have you decided what you're gonna sing yet?
You really know chuff-all about kids!
Liam's rivals are here.
Snidey little bastards.
They'll crucify him.
I know.
I didn't put him up to it.
I'll try and talk him out of it.
Wait.
Let me.
(DROWNED OUT BY CHEERS)
You've never performed in front of the family, let alone the Chatsworth.
And you can't make a guitar hip-hop.
Did you fix this so I'd play again, or to score points?
No!
I mean, of course I want you to play, for yourself.
I care.
I care about all of you.
Even your bloody dad!
Why?
He's rubbish at everything.
And as soon as you realise that, you'll leave.
And as soon as you realise that, you'll leave.
I won't.
I know what I've bought into.
It may not seem perfect, but what is?
God, look at the baggage I lug about.
I think we both need each other.
Why not give us a chance, eh?
Now our next act must really fancy his chances, playing acoustic guitar.
You don't need to do this, love!
You don't need to do this, love!
Yeah, I do.
It's our Liam Gallagher!

Lan, no!

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
You don't deserve friends like these.
What the fuck happened between you two?
Will you tell him, or shall I?
It was a long time ago.
And neither of us came out of it with any credit.
Doesn't matter.
Needs telling.
Bastard hung me out to dry.
Said he'd taken me as far as he could, but he was lying out of his arse.
He was being bankrolled by gangsters, and when they needed muscle, they got the best of his stable.
That Judas gave me up, after treating me like...
f-f-fucking...
I tried to send you back to your mother.
I couldn't go back to Belfast.
I was a dead man there!
You knew that.
Knew I wanted away from that shite.
You should have stuck up for me.
But you dropped me right back in it, you weak fuck.
I was just a boy.
I was never gonna be good enough to be a contender, but I had a shot at being decent.
Not bad.
Instead, I've just been a fucking letdown.
I'm so sorry, son.
I'm not gonna be a fireman.
I failed.
My last test.
I lied.
I just...
I just wanted to get one over on you, Dad.
Fuck sake, son, who cares?
You're a hero.
Better man than I'll ever fucking be.
'I never used to know what people meant 'when they said, "I don't feel meself."
'I'd be like, "Really, not even a tickle?"
'I had no idea it was about how happy they were, in themselves.
'Confidence is like love, innit?
'We all want some, but it's hard to hold on to.
'Some get lucky.
They're born sure.
'Bastards.
'Others find their feet eventually, after a lot of tumbles.
'And then there's them ones who get a buzz when they achieve stuff.
'But they're up and down.
'The rest have one good day where they can take on the world, 'but mostly crap ones.
'Thing is, since I started believing a bit more,
'I have been "feeling myself", 'fucking loads.
'And it feels mega!

A prisoner in your own body, your only escape, your only release.
In your dreams.
Maybe miracles don't just happen to other people.
Shit!
Your dad's in the Jockey.
Count this as a warning, Daddy dearest.

I'm sick of being told what to do!
Now you're gonna do some listening!
Father Francis.
Here for the cure.
Jesus!
The Inbetweeners S03E05 "Home Alone"
Sync corrections: extreme
Weekends in suburbia are a great time to wash the car, mow the lawn or insult your children.
Right, we'll only be a couple of hours, try not to break anything.
Don't you want to take Benji?
We're going to weed Granddad's grave, you moron.
Why would we want to take that shitting machine with us?
- He likes the fresh air.
- So do my bollocks, it doesn't mean I take them out in graveyards.
Dickhead.
With his parents gone, Jay did what pretty much every male human does when they think they might get five minutes alone in the house.
Unfortunately for him, he wasn't alone.
He had company.
Fucking hell, Benji!
Jay was into some pretty weird stuff, but even he drew the line at letting the family pet stare at his penis.
- Why didn't you just shut him out the room?
- I tried that, but he goes mental, scratches at the door and howls.
That's even more distracting.
- Or you could take him to a dog training class?
- I think they teach more, "Sit, stay, beg,"
not, "Stop watching me wank, you're putting me off."
Why didn't you buy a PS3?
Everyone knows that Wiis are for children and girls.
- And gays.
- Will, I'm just heading out...
Sorry, didn't realise you had friends round.
Hello, boys.
- Hi, Mrs McKenzie.
- Hello.
- All right?
- I see you're enjoying Will's new W-I-I.
- It's called a Wii.
- It's pretty neat, isn't it?
It's the only computer game I've ever been able to play.
- Would you like a game now, Mrs McKenzie?
- No, I'm not very good.
Even Will can beat me.
- You must be terrible.
- I'll give you some tips.
With this one, the trick is to bounce around a lot.
- Is it?
- Yeah, you really need to bounce up and down.
- OK, maybe, I'll give it a quick game.
- No, you definitely won't!
- Did you want something?
- Not really.
I'm just going away for the weekend and wondered if there was anything special
- you wanted from Waitrose?
- You're going away?
Where?
- To a friend's house in the Cotswolds.
- You don't have any friends in the Cotswolds.
- Yes, I do.
- Who?
- Fergus.
- Sorry, who?
Fergus.
We were friends at college and we've just recently caught up again on Facebooks.
You're going away with a Facebook stalker?
Do you not watch the news?
Where's he taking you, a ditch off the A40?
I know you're upset, but try not to overreact.
Maybe we should talk about this later.
No, let's talk about it now in front of everyone!
I've got nothing to hide, have you?
Will, try and stay calm or you'll have an asthma attack
- just like you did when we lost Teddy.
- OK, fine, yeah, we'll talk about it later.
For the record, it was an allergy, it wasn't Teddy's fault.
But luckily, the others didn't take the piss for too long, because they were obsessed with the really big news of the day.
With Will's mum on Facebook, that's tonight's wank lined up.
I doubt she's put anything too outrageous up there.
As long as it has the eyes.
Eyes is all I really need.
Why is she going away to get wrinkly old cock when she could stay at home and have my massive young pole?
It's a mystery to me.
That is perhaps the greatest mystery of all time.
Oi, Neil.
Why do that?
- It's just funny.
- And cool.
But that's someone's garden.
It's vandalism.
Nah, vandalism is like smashing in windows or something.
- This is just a laugh.
Give it a go, Si.
- Don't think so.
What, in case you go to prison for killing flowers?
Don't worry, Si, it don't hurt them, they ain't got feelings.
Look.
I'll pass.
Good luck with the landscape gardening,
- see you later.
- Where you going?
Golf.
Got the father-son tournament at the weekend.
Golf?
!
Golf is for fat wankers in their 40s.
- You know what golf stands for?
- No, what?
Gay outdoor lifestyle with fellas.
Brilliant!
Well, it's not as entertaining as playing with flowers, but I sort of don't care what you say, because it turns out I'm quite good at it and we might actually win.
Win!
See you later, then.
Mate, that is too perfect.
- Nice!
- What?
Come on.
Listen, Tiger Wuss, you should probably get off, you won't like this.
Some flowers are about to get fucked up.
So while the other three were enjoying themselves, I was having a terrible week.
Finding out your mum is on Facebook is bad enough, but finding out she's using it to look for cock is beyond the pale.
Am I overreacting?
I've never been introduced to even the notion of a boyfriend,
I think I'm entitled to be reasonably defensive about him.
Neil, your parents have been divorced longer than mine, what was it like when your mum had her first boyfriend?
It weren't too bad.
He was a bit like my dad.
She's got a type.
- Gays.
- Fuck off.
- It's still difficult though, isn't it?
- Yeah, no, I understand.
Do you think this is the first knob she's had since your dad?
Maybe we'll leave the heart-to-heart for now, then, Neil.
But we have established that this Fergus bloke is boning her?
They're just going to Bath for the weekend, sightseeing.
The major sight being her tits in his mouth.
I think it's the Roman Baths, actually.
So, when should we come round for the party?
Never?
Come on, if your mum's going away, you've got to have a party.
No.
I'm not going to be one of these idiots who advertise a small gathering on Facebook, then 4,000 people turn up, the roof gets stolen and the next morning they are on the news saying, "Things just got out of hand."
Plus, your mum would probably find out, now she's on Facebook.
Yeah, tell her she hasn't replied to my friend request yet.
Please stop looking at my mum on the internet, Neil.
Did a lot more than look at her last night.
- And that's an OK thing to say now, is it?
- All right, let's keep this party simples.
Just us, a crate of vodka and a Jacuzzi full of clunge.
No parties and no imaginary orgies.
That's the last thing I need.
It's bad enough my mum's now practically internet dating.
McKenzie?
Did you just say your mother is internet dating?
Sort of.
Interesting.
I'm single at the moment, and she is very much my type.
OK...
Maybe you could set me up with her, and then who knows?
If things go well, you could end up calling me Daddy.
Was this what you wanted to see me about, sir?
No.
My office, now.
Great, now even the head of Sixth Form was doing jokes about my mum.
At least, I hoped he was joking.
As I'm sure you're aware, there's been a spate of vandalism recently, culminating in someone adapting the flower display by the main road so that it now reads,
"We cum tit village."
You think that's funny, do you, McKenzie?
Well, a bit.
It doesn't even make sense!
"We cum tit village"?
What kind of morons would do that?
I think you know exactly who did it.
What?
I don't know, sir.
Honestly I don't.
Come on, McKenzie.
You're the sort of busybody that knows everything that's going on.
You can't resist getting that beak of yours into other people's business.
- Beak?
- Yes, your beaky nose!
And if you don't tell me who did it, in my role as your UCAS referee,
I will fuck your application up.
I honestly don't know who did it!
I don't!
I would have grassed, you know I would have grassed, straightaway!
Yes, that is true.
Well, you've got until Monday to find out or it's "Goodbye, first-rate education,
"hello, the University of Lincoln".
This was serious.
I'd been to Lincoln, and it's a shit hole.
But luckily, I was about to take part in the shortest investigation ever.
- What did Gilbert want, then?
- He thinks I know
- who vandalised the roundabout.
- Maybe you do.
Oh, God, it was you two, wasn't it?
I can't remember.
Was it us, Neil?
- I can't remember, Jay.
- Yeah, it was us.
Fucking brilliant.
Well done, you morons.
- Thanks.
- You going to grass them up, then?
- Yes!
Of course!
- Oh, Will!
Fine!
No, then!
Yeah, hilarious, you vandalise something, I end up at the University of Lincoln.
- I'll tell you what will be hilarious.
- What's that?
When Gilbert fucks your mum.
He will crush her.
Nah, her lovely big tits will cushion him, I reckon.
- Yeah, if he's on top.
- But what about from behind, Neil?
Can you imagine the size of his bollocks?
It'd be like two massive wrecking balls smashing against her arse.
- Lovely image.
- She's going to be a mess when he's finished with her.
Maybe he'll go twos-up with that Fergus bloke!
What an enjoyable conversation this is about my actual mother.
Yeah, I bet she's getting a load right now.
She isn't, because she doesn't leave till tomorrow.
Simon, do you want to stay over?
- What?
!
You said no-one was allowed round.
- It's for security reasons.
You mean you're too scared to sleep in the house on your own?
- No!
- I can't, sorry.
I've got the golf tournament at eight on Sunday, so I promised my dad I wouldn't be out late on Saturday.
Tell you what, Briefcase, I need a night away from the dog, so if you're going to be scared, I'll stay round.
I won't charge.
I just need some baby lotion and access to your mum's knicker drawer.
Well, it's a lovely offer, but I think I'll pass.
- Neil, are you around?
- As long as I can bring my PS3 so we don't have to play those shit Wii games.
- Yeah, anything you like.
- How come he can fucking stay and I can't?
Well, mainly because he's not planning to ejaculate over my mother's underwear.
I ain't promising nothing.
The next day, and my mum was all set to go.
Now, I'm not one for making rash judgements, but to me,
Fergus looked like a massive ginger bell end with a stupid car, and I hated him.
The fridge is full, but if you need anything else, the Ocado account number is by the computer.
You are only going to be away for one night, aren't you?
Probably.
I've left the heating on constant in case you get cold, and don't forget, Mrs Springett's got a key, so she'll be popping in to check you're OK.
I'll look forward to an unscheduled appearance from her, then.
Oh, and Neil, Will's a little bit stressed at the moment and me not being around might bring on one of his migraines.
If that does happen, there are special suppositories in the bathroom cabinet.
- Mum!
- It's the only thing that works.
He's usually a bit sick, can't keep painkillers down.
- You just need to pop two in.
- In where?
Well, they are suppositories, so in his bottom.
For a joke?
No, to stop his headache.
Bye, petal.
Well, that is not happening.
Seriously, I don't care if you're dying,
- I'm going nowhere near your arsehole.
- No, sure, fair enough.
OK, so they've gone, then.
That's actually happened.
Fine.
Come on, then, Neil.
Let's run through a few house rules.
Nothing too crazy...
- Shotgun your mum's bed.
- Right.
As Neil made himself very much at home, Jay had come up with a plan to put some distance between his sexual organs and the dog.
He'd temporarily lose Benji, run home and do what he had to do, do what he had to do again, and once more if it wasn't too painful, then head out with some "lost dog" signs and a £20 reward.
Unfortunately, Benji - a dog - was too smart for him.
Fucking hell, Benji!
Back at mine, I was fighting a losing battle to house-train my new pet.
- Do you eat this much toast at home?
- Will, what's this pesto?
Is it for humans?
No, it's for extraterrestrials, that's why we keep it in the fridge.
- Of course it's for fucking humans.
- Can you have it on toast?
- Please use a plate.
- All right, gays.
- How did you get in?
- Front door was open.
- Neil, did you leave the front door open?
- Might have done.
- Do us some toast, Neil.
- All right.
Sorry, is there a sign outside by the permanently open front door saying, "This way to the toast bar"?
Look, you're not even watching the TV.
All right, calm down, Home Alone.
It's just force of habit.
- Why are you even here?
- I needed to get away from my place.
- The dog's driving me fucking mad.
- Because it stares at you while you masturbate?
- Exactly.
- How long have you had him now?
- About eight years.
- Has he always done it?
No, of course he hasn't!
I wasn't wanking a lot when I was ten, was I?
I thought you got laid when you was nine?
With a fit babysitter.
Yes, I did, Neil.
That was why I wasn't wanking so much.
Something must have started him off.
I think he might have chewed on a tissue under my bed and now he's got a taste for it.
Jesus, that's some acquired taste, dry Kleenex and your ejaculate.
- Here y'are, Jay.
- Cheers.
- Can you try and be a bit tidier, please?
- I tell you what won't be tidy, your mum's tits.
I bet Fergus is covering them in spooge right now.
- Can we not talk about this?
- Chuck us a drink, Neil.
No-one is chucking anything.
If you want a drink, then pour yourself a glass.
- The glasses are up there.
- God, it's like staying at The Ritz.
Famous for its "no chucking drinks or toast" policy.
- There's no fucking glasses.
- Try the dishwasher.
Oh, for God's sake!
Right, we're going out.
- Out where?
- I don't care.
Outside.
Out of here.
Fucking hell, I'll buy you a new glass if you're going to get so menstrual about it.
It's not about the glass.
You're like a plague of toast-eating locusts.
Fine, we'll go out.
Neil, I think it's time we took Will on a pussy patrol.
So I was taken along on the pussy patrol, and it was pretty much everything I dreamed it would be.
This is the pussy patrol, is it?
Driving your mum's car very slowly round the estate?
- Sometimes we go down the shops.
- Have you even got your licence?
Provisional.
So all the time you've been driving, it's been illegal?
Great.
It's fine.
If we get stopped, we just say I'm giving him a lesson.
You aren't allowed to give lessons till you've been driving for three years.
- No, you just say disabled, then it's allowed.
- Who's disabled?
You or him?
One of us.
You say it's a mental disablement.
- Yeah, I do a really good voice.
- Oh, well, I look forward to that.
Watch that squirrel, Jay.
Nah, he'll shit himself and jump out the way, they always do.
Hilarious!
You just lost a game of chicken with a rodent.
- He's still there!
He's mugging you off, mate!
- Yeah, we'll see who's the chicken.
Oh, my God, he's jumped out the way.
He's made you look a right mug!
Fuck this!
Right.
Oh, God.
Oh, no!
Why did you do that?
Not so clever now, is he?
Now who's the fucking mug?
I don't think it was trying to make you look a mug, Jay.
- Fucking little piss-taker.
- I'll get a spade, we'll bury him.
Nah, fuck him!
His eyes look sad.
Great.
So, so far in Jay and Neil's war against Mother Nature, the death toll stood at 52 flowers and one piss-taking squirrel.
With the blood of a defenceless animal on our hands, and on Jay's wheel arches, we headed back to mine.
- All right.
Where have you been?
- Jesus Christ, Simon, you scared the shit out of me!
How did you get in here?
- Back door was open.
- Oh, yeah, sorry.
- Mate, what the fuck are you wearing?
- It's a polo shirt and chinos.
You look like my cousin when he went for a job interview.
- Oh, is he a golf pro?
- No, he's got Down's syndrome.
This is what everyone wears for golf.
Can I make some toast, Will?
Pop one in for us, Si.
I'm just going to shit out a poo, yeah?
Use the downstairs toilet.
And open a window!
Who's that?
Hello.
This is for Polly Milf-Kenzie.
If this was my dickish friends' way of taking my mind off what Fergus was doing to my mum, it wasn't working.
- Who ordered these?
- I know, I'm a genius.
Your mum left her card details on a Post-it on the laptop.
- That's for emergencies only!
- It was an emergency, your house is fucking boring!
Now we can get totally wankered.
No, I'm getting it refunded.
I don't want to get wankered,
I want everything to be the same as it was before she went away.
- What?
- Nothing.
- We haven't done anything, have we, Si?
- No.
We haven't been anywhere near your Facebook page.
For fuck's sake, what have you done?
Oh, you've changed my profile pic to a fat, naked man and you've changed my status to, "Will is fingering his cat".
- Presumably, you've changed the password too?
- Yep.
Do you like the picture?
The knob's a bit big, but other than that, it's definitely you.
Seriously, you've got to tell me the password.
What if my mum sees this?
She won't.
I don't think Fergus can get Facebook on the end of his cock.
Look, if you don't tell me the password,
I'm contacting the site administrator and reporting you.
Look out, Si, he's going to get the Facebook police onto us!
Oh no, I don't want to get told off by the nerds who run Facebook!
Please, I'm begging you!
OK.
You can have the password if I can stay over.
- I thought it was boring here?
- It is, but you don't have a dog, and I have certain needs to fulfil.
Oh, Christ.
All right, you can fucking stay.
Now, what's the password?
- I heart...
- I heart...
- ...my mum's vagina.
- Brilliant.
- And that's not even it!
Jay?
- Briefcase wanker.
Pricks.
So I'm no longer fingering a cat, but now I can't return the lager.
Thanks, Jay.
- You're welcome.
Si?
- I can't really,
- I've got the tournament tomorrow.
- Just one?
Oh, fuck it, I can probably have one, can't I?
- Toilet's blocked.
- What do you mean toilet's blocked?
It's blocked.
So what you mean is, you've blocked the toilet.
Maybe.
I don't know.
I'm not a plumber.
- Oh, I can smell it from here.
- Yeah.
It was a bad one, to be honest.
Like the leftovers from Christmas dinner all in one go.
Oh, God.
So, as you'd expect, not a clean break.
And I ran out of toilet roll, so I had to use a wet towel.
Jesus Christ!
Well, I'm sorry, but from now on, all toilets are now out of bounds to guests.
- What?
- Hang on, what if I need to go?
- You could use the garden.
- I'm not a dog, Neil.
OK, I'd assumed it was a given, but I'll make it clear now, just in case:
No-one is to shit in my back garden.
- That's it.
- What?
I'll tell my dad that Benji did a shit in the house.
Did he?
No, but if I say he did, we'll have to keep him outside.
And then I can wank freely without him judging me.
- Your dad?
- No, the dog.
I don't know what they had for Christmas dinner round Neil's house, but it smelt like turkey stuffed with rotten eggs and Pedigree Chum.
Well, he's right, it's definitely blocked.
- What's going on?
- Watch this.
What the fuck are you doing?
This golf bat is perfect, it's exactly what we've been looking for.
Sorry, was that not clear?
Stop fucking vandalising my garden!
Oh, come on, Will, I thought that at first, but have a go, it's fun.
- Not for me, it's not.
- They're only daffodils.
Fucking little show-offs. "Ooh, look at me, I'm out first, I'm all yellow!"
- Have you gone mental?
- Just have a go, it's fun.
- They go miles.
- No.
What are you going to do next?
Tag up my bedroom?
Piss through my letterbox?
- Can we?
- No!
Right, come on, we're going out again.
Come on!
Babysitting these three was exhausting, so I did what all good babysitters do:
Hit the drink and let them get on with it.
Oh, Christ, I've got to sober up!
What am I going to tell my dad?
- To leave your mum.
She's a dog.
- Fuck off.
Oh yes.
Nice!
- I thought we did all these the other night?
- They grow back every day, don't they?
Or the bloke has replanted them at some effort and cost.
They're in the same place.
They must have grown back.
- Someone's replanted them, Neil.
- I doubt it.
They're flowers!
They grow.
That's what they do.
That's why nobody minds us smashing them up.
- You know a lot about gardening.
- My dad used to shag Delia Smith, didn't he?
Plus, this is public ground, so we can do what we like.
No, it isn't!
This is someone's front garden.
Where's the fence, then?
Nice.
This isn't right.
You shouldn't be doing this.
Oh, shut up for once.
- No-one cares, Will, everyone does it.
- By the way, they definitely don't.
In your whole life, have you ever just done something because it was a fucking laugh?
Look at you, hanging round the estate, drinking, smashing up people's gardens.
You're just a teenage pregnancy away from an ASBO.
Sorry, Neighbourhood Watch!
- Oh, come on, Will, it is a laugh.
- What would my mum say if she found out?
- I know what she's saying at the moment.
- Do you?
Yep. "Ooh, Fergus, ooh, Fergus, fuck me harder, in the mouth.
"Now quickly, get it in my arse, Fergus."
Fine, give it here, then.
Oi, Jay.
Dick Faldo!
- See?
- To be fair, that was brilliant.
- My go.
- No, one more.
Oi!
Stay there, or I'm calling the police!
- Run!
- Fuck off, you fat old shit!
Well, that's not helping!
So I had become what I hated, but thanks to the beauty of alcohol, I couldn't care less.
Here, what do you reckon this one would do to a daffodil then, Si?
I reckon it would smash the fuck out of it, Neil.
Nice!
I might have to borrow it and head over to that bloke's place
- when the flowers have grown back.
- Oh, come on, Neil.
Give the fat old shit one day off.
- Yeah, or he'll call the police!
- That was amazing, wasn't it?
I mean, did he think for one second that would scare me?
- Fucking daff-loving idiot!
- Yes!
Found it!
- Will's mum's vibrator.
- That's a rolling pin.
- It's still got the smell.
- It's a rolling pin.
Right, I've got some unfinished business to attend to, business pulling my cock with no dogs around.
- Not in my mum's bed!
- No, course not.
- Well, that's something.
- No, Neil's going to be wanking in there.
Found these in the wash basket.
Oh, yes, they've still got that lovely arsey smell.
- Game of shots for the loser?
- What about your golf?
I'm a natural, everyone says it.
A couple more won't make any difference.
The drink-driver's charter.
Cheers!
The next morning, we were woken by a terrible banging.
Either Jay was having the most aggressive wank ever, or something even more worrying was happening.
What's that?
Fucking hell, my head is killing me.
What's that noise?
- I think someone's at the front door.
- It's a bit early, isn't it?
- It's not that early.
- What?
Oh, fuck, shit!
It's past nine o' clock.
I should've been at golf an hour ago.
- I wouldn't leave just yet.
- What do you mean?
I'm already late!
Shall we see who's trying to smash the door down before you head out?
- Oh, fuck!
- Who is it?
- The bloke whose garden we destroyed.
- What, the fat old shit?
Yes, except he's not fat, he looks fucking hard.
I've got to get to golf, I've got seven missed calls, my dad will go mental.
Fuck!
Hide!
- Has he gone?
- Shit!
He's going to try the back door.
- So?
- What if Neil's left it open again?
Oh, shit!
- Morning!
- Neil, the back door!
- I locked it.
- Neil, get down!
- What?
- Oi!
- Yep, that should have fooled him.
- He looks well angry!
Shit, another missed call from my dad!
What are we going to do?
- I know you're in there.
- Let's go back in the living room.
- How's that going to help?
- I just farted in here.
Oh, God, Neil, I'm in its wake!
It's like you're carrying it in your pants!
- What the fuck's all the noise?
- We're under attack from the daffodil bloke.
- What?
- He's basically correct.
- We're being threatened.
- Come out here like a man!
- Does he know I'm here?
- I don't see how he could.
Good, I'm going back to bed, then.
Yoo-hoo!
I heard a banging.
Fucking Mrs Springett!
I know you're in there.
I saw your mate.
Come out and do some vandalism now, then!
- See?
I told you it was vandalism.
- Oh, my God, my dad is going to kill me.
- I think this guy might kill you first.
- I know your mum.
- Shit, he knows your mum.
- Everyone knows your mum!
- Not now, Neil.
- I know you're in there, I can see your feet.
- Neil!
- I was getting cramp.
Please, Will, say something to him.
See if he'll just let me out.
- Are you insane?
Listen to him.
- Please, mate, for my dad.
- This golf thing is massive for him.
- Go on, what's the worst he could do?
- Hit me really hard?
- He won't do that.
He won't.
Please, mate.
There's an old lady with a broken nose out here!
God!
Fine.
- Now, sir...
- Come out here, you coward!
I think we should all take a breath, try and calm down.
You're telling me to calm down?
Calm down?
!
I'll smash the shit out of your garden and see how you like it!
OK, I've got a really bad hangover, so if you aren't willing to have a sensible conversation, I'm going to shut the curtains.
Are you taking the moral fucking high ground?
Is that what you're doing?
- OK, I'm going to close these now.
- You think that's going to stop me?
- I'm closing them now.
- You think I give a fuck?
- About to close!
- You're a bunch of fucking vandals!
- I'd call the police, - ...closing...
- but I want to deal with you myself!
- ...and they're closed.
- He's gone.
Nice one.
- That's your solution?
- Do you have a better one?
- Oh, God.
Oh, God, my dad is never, ever going to forgive me.
- Anyone want any toast?
- Yeah, all right.
You all right, mate?
What's up?
Just got a text from my dad.
He's had Benji put down.
Said once they start shitting indoors, it's basically the end, anyway.
Kindest thing to do.
What have I done?
I'll never wank again!
Come on, mate, you will.
That'll probably be the police.
- Oh, shit.
- Is it them?
It's worse than that.
It's my mum.
It had been an interesting few days.
I'd squashed my first squirrel, found out that I had a beak, and seen evidence that Jay and Neil were surprisingly creative.
The only good news was that, having spent the weekend being fucked by a ginger stranger, my mum was dumped immediately, because, and I quote,
"He couldn't be dealing with a problem child."
Fucking Mrs Springett!
The Inbetweeners S03E05 "Home Alone"
Sync corrections: extreme
Weekends in suburbia are a great time to wash the car, mow the lawn or insult your children.
Right, we'll only be a couple of hours, try not to break anything.
Don't you want to take Benji?
We're going to weed Granddad's grave, you moron.
Why would we want to take that shitting machine with us?
- He likes the fresh air.
- So do my bollocks, it doesn't mean I take them out in graveyards.
Dickhead.
With his parents gone, Jay did what pretty much every male human does when they think they might get five minutes alone in the house.
Unfortunately for him, he wasn't alone.
He had company.
Fucking hell, Benji!
Jay was into some pretty weird stuff, but even he drew the line at letting the family pet stare at his penis.
- Why didn't you just shut him out the room?
- I tried that, but he goes mental, scratches at the door and howls.
That's even more distracting.
- Or you could take him to a dog training class?
- I think they teach more, "Sit, stay, beg,"
not, "Stop watching me wank, you're putting me off."
Why didn't you buy a PS3?
Everyone knows that Wiis are for children and girls.
- And gays.
- Will, I'm just heading out...
Sorry, didn't realise you had friends round.
Hello, boys.
- Hi, Mrs McKenzie.
- Hello.
- All right?
- I see you're enjoying Will's new W-I-I.
- It's called a Wii.
- It's pretty neat, isn't it?
It's the only computer game I've ever been able to play.
- Would you like a game now, Mrs McKenzie?
- No, I'm not very good.
Even Will can beat me.
- You must be terrible.
- I'll give you some tips.
With this one, the trick is to bounce around a lot.
- Is it?
- Yeah, you really need to bounce up and down.
- OK, maybe, I'll give it a quick game.
- No, you definitely won't!
- Did you want something?
- Not really.
I'm just going away for the weekend and wondered if there was anything special
- you wanted from Waitrose?
- You're going away?
Where?
- To a friend's house in the Cotswolds.
- You don't have any friends in the Cotswolds.
- Yes, I do.
- Who?
- Fergus.
- Sorry, who?
Fergus.
We were friends at college and we've just recently caught up again on Facebooks.
You're going away with a Facebook stalker?
Do you not watch the news?
Where's he taking you, a ditch off the A40?
I know you're upset, but try not to overreact.
Maybe we should talk about this later.
No, let's talk about it now in front of everyone!
I've got nothing to hide, have you?
Will, try and stay calm or you'll have an asthma attack
- just like you did when we lost Teddy.
- OK, fine, yeah, we'll talk about it later.
For the record, it was an allergy, it wasn't Teddy's fault.
But luckily, the others didn't take the piss for too long, because they were obsessed with the really big news of the day.
With Will's mum on Facebook, that's tonight's wank lined up.
I doubt she's put anything too outrageous up there.
As long as it has the eyes.
Eyes is all I really need.
Why is she going away to get wrinkly old cock when she could stay at home and have my massive young pole?
It's a mystery to me.
That is perhaps the greatest mystery of all time.
Oi, Neil.
Why do that?
- It's just funny.
- And cool.
But that's someone's garden.
It's vandalism.
Nah, vandalism is like smashing in windows or something.
- This is just a laugh.
Give it a go, Si.
- Don't think so.
What, in case you go to prison for killing flowers?
Don't worry, Si, it don't hurt them, they ain't got feelings.
Look.
I'll pass.
Good luck with the landscape gardening,
- see you later.
- Where you going?
Golf.
Got the father-son tournament at the weekend.
Golf?
!
Golf is for fat wankers in their 40s.
- You know what golf stands for?
- No, what?
Gay outdoor lifestyle with fellas.
Brilliant!
Well, it's not as entertaining as playing with flowers, but I sort of don't care what you say, because it turns out I'm quite good at it and we might actually win.
Win!
See you later, then.
Mate, that is too perfect.
- Nice!
- What?
Come on.
Listen, Tiger Wuss, you should probably get off, you won't like this.
Some flowers are about to get fucked up.
So while the other three were enjoying themselves, I was having a terrible week.
Finding out your mum is on Facebook is bad enough, but finding out she's using it to look for cock is beyond the pale.
Am I overreacting?
I've never been introduced to even the notion of a boyfriend,
I think I'm entitled to be reasonably defensive about him.
Neil, your parents have been divorced longer than mine, what was it like when your mum had her first boyfriend?
It weren't too bad.
He was a bit like my dad.
She's got a type.
- Gays.
- Fuck off.
- It's still difficult though, isn't it?
- Yeah, no, I understand.
Do you think this is the first knob she's had since your dad?
Maybe we'll leave the heart-to-heart for now, then, Neil.
But we have established that this Fergus bloke is boning her?
They're just going to Bath for the weekend, sightseeing.
The major sight being her tits in his mouth.
I think it's the Roman Baths, actually.
So, when should we come round for the party?
Never?
Come on, if your mum's going away, you've got to have a party.
No.
I'm not going to be one of these idiots who advertise a small gathering on Facebook, then 4,000 people turn up, the roof gets stolen and the next morning they are on the news saying, "Things just got out of hand."
Plus, your mum would probably find out, now she's on Facebook.
Yeah, tell her she hasn't replied to my friend request yet.
Please stop looking at my mum on the internet, Neil.
Did a lot more than look at her last night.
- And that's an OK thing to say now, is it?
- All right, let's keep this party simples.
Just us, a crate of vodka and a Jacuzzi full of clunge.
No parties and no imaginary orgies.
That's the last thing I need.
It's bad enough my mum's now practically internet dating.
McKenzie?
Did you just say your mother is internet dating?
Sort of.
Interesting.
I'm single at the moment, and she is very much my type.
OK...
Maybe you could set me up with her, and then who knows?
If things go well, you could end up calling me Daddy.
Was this what you wanted to see me about, sir?
No.
My office, now.
Great, now even the head of Sixth Form was doing jokes about my mum.
At least, I hoped he was joking.
As I'm sure you're aware, there's been a spate of vandalism recently, culminating in someone adapting the flower display by the main road so that it now reads,
"We cum tit village."
You think that's funny, do you, McKenzie?
Well, a bit.
It doesn't even make sense!
"We cum tit village"?
What kind of morons would do that?
I think you know exactly who did it.
What?
I don't know, sir.
Honestly I don't.
Come on, McKenzie.
You're the sort of busybody that knows everything that's going on.
You can't resist getting that beak of yours into other people's business.
- Beak?
- Yes, your beaky nose!
And if you don't tell me who did it, in my role as your UCAS referee,
I will fuck your application up.
I honestly don't know who did it!
I don't!
I would have grassed, you know I would have grassed, straightaway!
Yes, that is true.
Well, you've got until Monday to find out or it's "Goodbye, first-rate education,
"hello, the University of Lincoln".
This was serious.
I'd been to Lincoln, and it's a shit hole.
But luckily, I was about to take part in the shortest investigation ever.
- What did Gilbert want, then?
- He thinks I know
- who vandalised the roundabout.
- Maybe you do.
Oh, God, it was you two, wasn't it?
I can't remember.
Was it us, Neil?
- I can't remember, Jay.
- Yeah, it was us.
Fucking brilliant.
Well done, you morons.
- Thanks.
- You going to grass them up, then?
- Yes!
Of course!
- Oh, Will!
Fine!
No, then!
Yeah, hilarious, you vandalise something, I end up at the University of Lincoln.
- I'll tell you what will be hilarious.
- What's that?
When Gilbert fucks your mum.
He will crush her.
Nah, her lovely big tits will cushion him, I reckon.
- Yeah, if he's on top.
- But what about from behind, Neil?
Can you imagine the size of his bollocks?
It'd be like two massive wrecking balls smashing against her arse.
- Lovely image.
- She's going to be a mess when he's finished with her.
Maybe he'll go twos-up with that Fergus bloke!
What an enjoyable conversation this is about my actual mother.
Yeah, I bet she's getting a load right now.
She isn't, because she doesn't leave till tomorrow.
Simon, do you want to stay over?
- What?
!
You said no-one was allowed round.
- It's for security reasons.
You mean you're too scared to sleep in the house on your own?
- No!
- I can't, sorry.
I've got the golf tournament at eight on Sunday, so I promised my dad I wouldn't be out late on Saturday.
Tell you what, Briefcase, I need a night away from the dog, so if you're going to be scared, I'll stay round.
I won't charge.
I just need some baby lotion and access to your mum's knicker drawer.
Well, it's a lovely offer, but I think I'll pass.
- Neil, are you around?
- As long as I can bring my PS3 so we don't have to play those shit Wii games.
- Yeah, anything you like.
- How come he can fucking stay and I can't?
Well, mainly because he's not planning to ejaculate over my mother's underwear.
I ain't promising nothing.
The next day, and my mum was all set to go.
Now, I'm not one for making rash judgements, but to me,
Fergus looked like a massive ginger bell end with a stupid car, and I hated him.
The fridge is full, but if you need anything else, the Ocado account number is by the computer.
You are only going to be away for one night, aren't you?
Probably.
I've left the heating on constant in case you get cold, and don't forget, Mrs Springett's got a key, so she'll be popping in to check you're OK.
I'll look forward to an unscheduled appearance from her, then.
Oh, and Neil, Will's a little bit stressed at the moment and me not being around might bring on one of his migraines.
If that does happen, there are special suppositories in the bathroom cabinet.
- Mum!
- It's the only thing that works.
He's usually a bit sick, can't keep painkillers down.
- You just need to pop two in.
- In where?
Well, they are suppositories, so in his bottom.
For a joke?
No, to stop his headache.
Bye, petal.
Well, that is not happening.
Seriously, I don't care if you're dying,
- I'm going nowhere near your arsehole.
- No, sure, fair enough.
OK, so they've gone, then.
That's actually happened.
Fine.
Come on, then, Neil.
Let's run through a few house rules.
Nothing too crazy...
- Shotgun your mum's bed.
- Right.
As Neil made himself very much at home, Jay had come up with a plan to put some distance between his sexual organs and the dog.
He'd temporarily lose Benji, run home and do what he had to do, do what he had to do again, and once more if it wasn't too painful, then head out with some "lost dog" signs and a £20 reward.
Unfortunately, Benji - a dog - was too smart for him.
Fucking hell, Benji!
Back at mine, I was fighting a losing battle to house-train my new pet.
- Do you eat this much toast at home?
- Will, what's this pesto?
Is it for humans?
No, it's for extraterrestrials, that's why we keep it in the fridge.
- Of course it's for fucking humans.
- Can you have it on toast?
- Please use a plate.
- All right, gays.
- How did you get in?
- Front door was open.
- Neil, did you leave the front door open?
- Might have done.
- Do us some toast, Neil.
- All right.
Sorry, is there a sign outside by the permanently open front door saying, "This way to the toast bar"?
Look, you're not even watching the TV.
All right, calm down, Home Alone.
It's just force of habit.
- Why are you even here?
- I needed to get away from my place.
- The dog's driving me fucking mad.
- Because it stares at you while you masturbate?
- Exactly.
- How long have you had him now?
- About eight years.
- Has he always done it?
No, of course he hasn't!
I wasn't wanking a lot when I was ten, was I?
I thought you got laid when you was nine?
With a fit babysitter.
Yes, I did, Neil.
That was why I wasn't wanking so much.
Something must have started him off.
I think he might have chewed on a tissue under my bed and now he's got a taste for it.
Jesus, that's some acquired taste, dry Kleenex and your ejaculate.
- Here y'are, Jay.
- Cheers.
- Can you try and be a bit tidier, please?
- I tell you what won't be tidy, your mum's tits.
I bet Fergus is covering them in spooge right now.
- Can we not talk about this?
- Chuck us a drink, Neil.
No-one is chucking anything.
If you want a drink, then pour yourself a glass.
- The glasses are up there.
- God, it's like staying at The Ritz.
Famous for its "no chucking drinks or toast" policy.
- There's no fucking glasses.
- Try the dishwasher.
Oh, for God's sake!
Right, we're going out.
- Out where?
- I don't care.
Outside.
Out of here.
Fucking hell, I'll buy you a new glass if you're going to get so menstrual about it.
It's not about the glass.
You're like a plague of toast-eating locusts.
Fine, we'll go out.
Neil, I think it's time we took Will on a pussy patrol.
So I was taken along on the pussy patrol, and it was pretty much everything I dreamed it would be.
This is the pussy patrol, is it?
Driving your mum's car very slowly round the estate?
- Sometimes we go down the shops.
- Have you even got your licence?
Provisional.
So all the time you've been driving, it's been illegal?
Great.
It's fine.
If we get stopped, we just say I'm giving him a lesson.
You aren't allowed to give lessons till you've been driving for three years.
- No, you just say disabled, then it's allowed.
- Who's disabled?
You or him?
One of us.
You say it's a mental disablement.
- Yeah, I do a really good voice.
- Oh, well, I look forward to that.
Watch that squirrel, Jay.
Nah, he'll shit himself and jump out the way, they always do.
Hilarious!
You just lost a game of chicken with a rodent.
- He's still there!
He's mugging you off, mate!
- Yeah, we'll see who's the chicken.
Oh, my God, he's jumped out the way.
He's made you look a right mug!
Fuck this!
Right.
Oh, God.
Oh, no!
Why did you do that?
Not so clever now, is he?
Now who's the fucking mug?
I don't think it was trying to make you look a mug, Jay.
- Fucking little piss-taker.
- I'll get a spade, we'll bury him.
Nah, fuck him!
His eyes look sad.
Great.
So, so far in Jay and Neil's war against Mother Nature, the death toll stood at 52 flowers and one piss-taking squirrel.
Eventually, and with the blood of a defenceless animal on our hands, and on Jay's wheel arches, we headed back to mine.
- All right.
Where have you been?
- Jesus Christ, Simon, you scared the shit out of me!
How did you get in here?
- Back door was open.
- Oh, yeah, sorry.
- Mate, what the fuck are you wearing?
- It's a polo shirt and chinos.
You look like my cousin when he went for a job interview.
- Oh, is he a golf pro?
- No, he's got Down's syndrome.
This is what everyone wears for golf.
Can I make some toast, Will?
Pop one in for us, Si.
I'm just going to shit out a poo, yeah?
Use the downstairs toilet.
And open a window!
Who's that?
Hello.
This is for Polly Milf-Kenzie.
If this was my dickish friends' way of taking my mind off what Fergus was doing to my mum, it wasn't working.
- Who ordered these?
- I know, I'm a genius.
Your mum left her card details on a Post-it on the laptop.
- That's for emergencies only!
- It was an emergency, your house is fucking boring!
Now we can get totally wankered.
No, I'm getting it refunded.
I don't want to get wankered,
I want everything to be the same as it was before she went away.
- What?
- Nothing.
- We haven't done anything, have we, Si?
- No.
We haven't been anywhere near your Facebook page.
For fuck's sake, what have you done?
Oh, you've changed my profile pic to a fat, naked man and you've changed my status to, "Will is fingering his cat".
- Presumably, you've changed the password too?
- Yep.
Do you like the picture?
The knob's a bit big, but other than that, it's definitely you.
Seriously, you've got to tell me the password.
What if my mum sees this?
She won't.
I don't think Fergus can get Facebook on the end of his cock.
Look, if you don't tell me the password,
I'm contacting the site administrator and reporting you.
Look out, Si, he's going to get the Facebook police onto us!
Oh no, I don't want to get told off by the nerds who run Facebook!
Please, I'm begging you!
OK.
You can have the password if I can stay over.
- I thought it was boring here?
- It is, but you don't have a dog, and I have certain needs to fulfil.
Oh, Christ.
All right, you can fucking stay.
Now, what's the password?
- I heart...
- I heart...
- ...my mum's vagina.
- Brilliant.
- And that's not even it!
Jay?
- Briefcase wanker.
Pricks.
So I'm no longer fingering a cat, but now I can't return the lager.
Thanks, Jay.
- You're welcome.
Si?
- I can't really,
- I've got the tournament tomorrow.
- Just one?
Oh, fuck it, I can probably have one, can't I?
- Toilet's blocked.
- What do you mean toilet's blocked?
It's blocked.
So what you mean is, you've blocked the toilet.
Maybe.
I don't know.
I'm not a plumber.
- Oh, I can smell it from here.
- Yeah.
It was a bad one, to be honest.
Like the leftovers from Christmas dinner all in one go.
Oh, God.
So, as you'd expect, not a clean break.
And I ran out of toilet roll, so I had to use a wet towel.
Jesus Christ!
Well, I'm sorry, but from now on, all toilets are now out of bounds to guests.
- What?
- Hang on, what if I need to go?
- You could use the garden.
- I'm not a dog, Neil.
OK, I'd assumed it was a given, but I'll make it clear now, just in case:
No-one is to shit in my back garden.
- That's it.
- What?
I'll tell my dad that Benji did a shit in the house.
Did he?
No, but if I say he did, we'll have to keep him outside.
And then I can wank freely without him judging me.
- Your dad?
- No, the dog.
I don't know what they had for Christmas dinner round Neil's house, but it smelt like turkey stuffed with rotten eggs and Pedigree Chum.
Well, he's right, it's definitely blocked.
- What's going on?
- Watch this.
What the fuck are you doing?
This golf bat is perfect, it's exactly what we've been looking for.
Sorry, was that not clear?
Stop fucking vandalising my garden!
Oh, come on, Will, I thought that at first, but have a go, it's fun.
- Not for me, it's not.
- They're only daffodils.
Fucking little show-offs. "Ooh, look at me, I'm out first, I'm all yellow!"
- Have you gone mental?
- Just have a go, it's fun.
- They go miles.
- No.
What are you going to do next?
Tag up my bedroom?
Piss through my letterbox?
- Can we?
- No!
Right, come on, we're going out again.
Come on!
Babysitting these three was exhausting, so I did what all good babysitters do:
Hit the drink and let them get on with it.
Oh, Christ, I've got to sober up!
What am I going to tell my dad?
- To leave your mum.
She's a dog.
- Fuck off.
Oh yes.
Nice!
- I thought we did all these the other night?
- They grow back every day, don't they?
Or the bloke has replanted them at some effort and cost.
They're in the same place.
They must have grown back.
- Someone's replanted them, Neil.
- I doubt it.
They're flowers!
They grow.
That's what they do.
That's why nobody minds us smashing them up.
- You know a lot about gardening.
- My dad used to shag Delia Smith, didn't he?
Plus, this is public ground, so we can do what we like.
No, it isn't!
This is someone's front garden.
Where's the fence, then?
Nice.
This isn't right.
You shouldn't be doing this.
Oh, shut up for once.
- No-one cares, Will, everyone does it.
- By the way, they definitely don't.
In your whole life, have you ever just done something because it was a fucking laugh?
Look at you, hanging round the estate, drinking, smashing up people's gardens.
You're just a teenage pregnancy away from an ASBO.
Sorry, Neighbourhood Watch!
- Oh, come on, Will, it is a laugh.
- What would my mum say if she found out?
- I know what she's saying at the moment.
- Do you?
Yep. "Ooh, Fergus, ooh, Fergus, fuck me harder, in the mouth.
"Now quickly, get it in my arse, Fergus."
Fine, give it here, then.
Oi, Jay.
Dick Faldo!
- See?
- To be fair, that was brilliant.
- My go.
- No, one more.
Oi!
Stay there, or I'm calling the police!
- Run!
- Fuck off, you fat old shit!
Well, that's not helping!
So I had become what I hated, but thanks to the beauty of alcohol, I couldn't care less.
Here, what do you reckon this one would do to a daffodil then, Si?
I reckon it would smash the fuck out of it, Neil.
Nice!
I might have to borrow it and head over to that bloke's place
- when the flowers have grown back.
- Oh, come on, Neil.
Give the fat old shit one day off.
- Yeah, or he'll call the police!
- That was amazing, wasn't it?
I mean, did he think for one second that would scare me?
- Fucking daff-loving idiot!
- Yes!
Found it!
- Will's mum's vibrator.
- That's a rolling pin.
- It's still got the smell.
- It's a rolling pin.
Right, I've got some unfinished business to attend to, business pulling my cock with no dogs around.
- Not in my mum's bed!
- No, course not.
- Well, that's something.
- No, Neil's going to be wanking in there.
Found these in the wash basket.
Oh, yes, they've still got that lovely arsey smell.
- Game of shots for the loser?
- What about your golf?
I'm a natural, everyone says it.
A couple more won't make any difference.
The drink-driver's charter.
Cheers!
The next morning, we were woken by a terrible banging.
Either Jay was having the most aggressive wank ever, or something even more worrying was happening.
What's that?
Fucking hell, my head is killing me.
What's that noise?
- I think someone's at the front door.
- It's a bit early, isn't it?
- It's not that early.
- What?
Oh, fuck, shit!
It's past nine o' clock.
I should've been at golf an hour ago.
- I wouldn't leave just yet.
- What do you mean?
I'm already late!
Shall we see who's trying to smash the door down before you head out?
- Oh, fuck!
- Who is it?
- The bloke whose garden we destroyed.
- What, the fat old shit?
Yes, except he's not fat, he looks fucking hard.
I've got to get to golf, I've got seven missed calls, my dad will go mental.
Fuck!
Hide!
- Has he gone?
- Shit!
He's going to try the back door.
- So?
- What if Neil's left it open again?
Oh, shit!
- Morning!
- Neil, the back door!
- I locked it.
- Neil, get down!
- What?
- Oi!
- Yep, that should have fooled him.
- He looks well angry!
Shit, another missed call from my dad!
What are we going to do?
- I know you're in there.
- Let's go back in the living room.
- How's that going to help?
- I just farted in here.
Oh, God, Neil, I'm in its wake!
It's like you're carrying it in your pants!
- What the fuck's all the noise?
- We're under attack from the daffodil bloke.
- What?
- He's basically correct.
- We're being threatened.
- Come out here like a man!
- Does he know I'm here?
- I don't see how he could.
Good, I'm going back to bed, then.
Yoo-hoo!
I heard a banging.
Fucking Mrs Springett!
I know you're in there.
I saw your mate.
Come out and do some vandalism now, then!
- See?
I told you it was vandalism.
- Oh, my God, my dad is going to kill me.
- I think this guy might kill you first.
- I know your mum.
- Shit, he knows your mum.
- Everyone knows your mum!
- Not now, Neil.
- I know you're in there, I can see your feet.
- Neil!
- I was getting cramp.
Please, Will, say something to him.
See if he'll just let me out.
- Are you insane?
Listen to him.
- Please, mate, for my dad.
- This golf thing is massive for him.
- Go on, what's the worst he could do?
- Hit me really hard?
- He won't do that.
He won't.
Please, mate.
There's an old lady with a broken nose out here!
God!
Fine.
- Now, sir...
- Come out here, you coward!
I think we should all take a breath, try and calm down.
You're telling me to calm down?
Calm down?
!
I'll smash the shit out of your garden and see how you like it!
OK, I've got a really bad hangover, so if you aren't willing to have a sensible conversation, I'm going to shut the curtains.
Are you taking the moral fucking high ground?
Is that what you're doing?
- OK, I'm going to close these now.
- You think that's going to stop me?
- I'm closing them now.
- You think I give a fuck?
- About to close!
- You're a bunch of fucking vandals!
- I'd call the police, - ...closing...
- but I want to deal with you myself!
- ...and they're closed.
- He's gone.
Nice one.
- That's your solution?
- Do you have a better one?
- Oh, God.
Oh, God, my dad is never, ever going to forgive me.
- Anyone want any toast?
- Yeah, all right.
You all right, mate?
What's up?
Just got a text from my dad.
He's had Benji put down.
Said once they start shitting indoors, it's basically the end, anyway.
Kindest thing to do.
What have I done?
I'll never wank again!
Come on, mate, you will.
That'll probably be the police.
- Oh, shit.
- Is it them?
It's worse than that.
It's my mum.
It had been an interesting few days.
I'd squashed my first squirrel, found out that I had a beak, and seen evidence that Jay and Neil were surprisingly creative.
The only good news was that, having spent the weekend being fucked by a ginger stranger, my mum was dumped immediately, because, and I quote,
"He couldn't be dealing with a problem child."
Fucking Mrs Springett!
Why is everything rusted, Grandpa?
That's what happens when junk gets old.
Well, you're not rusted.
Well, I'm not junk and I'm not old.
You look old.
You want to live to see eight?
I'd just shut up, and pick something out, if I were you.
Do I really get to break anything I want?
It's your birthday.
Take a look around here, see if there's anything catches your eye.
Oh, wow, Grandpa.
Yeah, I figured that'd be just the ticket.
Come on, I got it all locked and loaded.
Let's see how these fit.
Cool.
Perfect.
There's your control panel.
Now, the most important thing about this, Tommy, is you do not tell your mother.
Okay.
What are you waiting for, some overtime?
Hit it!
Does it hurt?
- No.
- Are you sure?
Yeah, it's a car.
It doesn't feel anything.
Then why is it bleeding?
The First Amendment:
Freedom of the press, religion, assembly,
- petition and...
- Yeah, well, you go get a life, too, you little pipsqueak!
Speech!
Clearly they did not have Tony in mind when writing that.
...I don't want to see you!
The little rat "nexted" me!
Hi, there.
Hey, I'm Tony.
What's he doing?
Annoying me.
Besides that.
It's called random chat.
It's through a Web site that video-connects you to random strangers.
- Come on!
- A person doesn't like who they're chatting with, they just hit "next" and move on.
Let me guess.
Tony keeps getting "nexted."
This I must see.
It's not funny, Ziva.
Longest I've gone is ten seconds.
Well, perhaps you're not as interesting as you think you are.
This from coming from a woman reading the Bill of Rights for entertainment.
Get out of here.
Back off!
I don't want you taking credit when I work it out.
Hi, ladies.
Ew!
What are you, like 40?
!
Why would you want to talk to complete strangers anyway?
Okay, I'm just going to have to up my game here.
What can I do?
Finger puppets or maybe a furry... barnyard animal.
I got it!
Ha!
Never fails to please.
Hi, boss.
- This isn't what it looks like.
- Yeah?
Just out of curiosity, how exactly does this look?
It looks like we got a dead Marine.
Grab your gear.
And a little self-respect, DiNozzo.
- You bring your laptop?
- Yeah, why?
Bet I'd last longer than ten seconds in random chat with this guy as a backdrop.
Oh, Tony, you really need to stop.
- Will you stop?
- I'm not stopping.
I stripped the car myself yesterday.
The trunk was empty.
Do you have any security cameras?
He's got tons of them.
But they're not hooked up to anything.
They're, uh, just for show.
What's that for?
Being brave.
And I also heard it's your birthday.
It is.
Uh, to whom do we have the misfortune?
Marine Corporal Ray Collins.
Local LEOs identified him, called us.
Discarded in a junkyard like a piece of trash.
Did you know that the word "junk" originally referred to nautical old rope of uncertain origin?
- Really?
- Yes.
I did not know that.
Eventually, it included any discarded item.
That's fascinating.
No, I'll tell you what's fascinating.
Time of death, Duck?
Uh, Mr. Palmer, let's get our corporal to a more suitable work surface.
I'm guessing the killer dumps the body, hoping the trash compactor will eliminate the evidence.
I'm thinking mugging.
Cash and credit cards are missing.
Well, I might agree with you if that were the only thing missing.
Meet Corporal Ray Collins.
No family, single, and according to his CO, no friends.
But his fitness eval is off the charts.
Guessing that's when he had feet.
He was serving in southwestern Afghanistan until he was court-martialed.
Charges?
- Everything.
- Larceny, drug dealing, assault.
Might not have ended up doing time, but he was definitely looking at a dishonorable discharge.
We were unable to trace the corporal's movements prior to his murder.
No credit card use.
Didn't have a cell phone.
No ATM camera walk-bys either.
But look what I found.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet the Ducati Desmosedici Double-R.
DMV records indicate that Collins bought one last month.
Added it to his Harley collection.
Ray liked motorcycles.
Motorcycles he shouldn't be able to afford on his base pay.
He was into something.
Unfortunately, with his record, there are dozens of people with motive to kill him.
Talk to the guys in his unit.
See if you can find one that actually did.
Me?
Like right now?
Yes, you.
Now.
Well, did the director say what it's about?
No, he didn't.
Can it wait, like, five minutes?
He wants you here now.
Why five minutes?
Because I had a breakthrough in the case, and if Gibbs' Gibbsometer is working, then he should be walking through my door any second.
- All I know is that he wants you right now...
- I gotta go.
Do you know something I don't know?
Probably not.
Director Vance's office called and he wants to see me.
- About what?
- I don't know.
That's just the thing.
It's a bad omen, though.
I remember last time the director wanted to see me... do you know about the last time the director
- wanted to see me?
- No.
Okay, there's no sense in mentioning that again.
Abbs... you said you had a breakthrough?
About the case.
Right.
Work.
Focus.
Okay.
So, Ducky found tissue underneath our victim's fingernails.
Most likely from the killer.
I ran the DNA.
No matches.
Doesn't sound much like a breakthrough.
Well, it's not.
But it is helpful.
Because all military DNA is on file.
Just means our killer wasn't in the military.
That rules out Director Vance.
Abby.
Right.
Work.
Okay, I heard that you were having trouble tracking
Corporal Collins' movements the night of the murder.
Luckily, I haven't, because he was wearing this.
It's a state-of-the-art GPS runner's watch.
It tracks your progress, suggests routes.
It holds GPS data for 24 hours.
I can give you a blow-by-blow.
So, Corporal Collins, he went for a jog on base, and then he went to eat, he wandered around for a bit.
And then, for some reason, spent two hours standing in the middle of the street.
That's good work.
Get the address to Tony and Ziva.
Nice job.
What the biohazardous material is this?
It's all they had.
A mini-POW!
?
Ugh!
This is another bad omen.
Gibbs, this does not bode well for my future.
Abby, I wouldn't worry about it.
Why's that?
Because I got your back.
Always have had.
Always will.
I cried because I had no shoes.
Then I met a man who had no feet.
An old Persian proverb.
A reminder to appreciate what we have.
Because we can always have less.
Or how about, uh,
"Don't count your bowling balls before they hatch, Fred."
Fred?
Uh, Fred Flintstone.
It's a... an unexpectedly profound series from the, uh...
Agent Gibbs!
So good of you to join us.
To join, uh, Dr. Mallard in his autopsy that I... merely assist in.
Yabba-Dabba-Doo!
What do you got, Duck?
A mess.
And a troubling one.
Yes.
Dislocations across his entire skeletal system.
Likely caused by the car crusher.
That how he died?
No, he bled to death.
Collins was alive when his feet were cut off?
Alive, but I doubt conscious.
He also has a mandibular fracture.
That was not caused by the car crusher.
This particular trauma is consistent with a blow to the jaw with something heavy... like a wrench or a piece of pipe.
So, someone knocked him out and then chopped off his feet.
Sawed them off, actually.
For reasons I shall leave you to speculate.
You're right, Duck.
Troubling.
Oh, we haven't showed you the troubling part yet.
Mr. Palmer, would you, uh, turn his head.
It's some kind of welt.
Uh, to be honest, aside from being the sign of the Devil,
I have no idea what it is.
Or how it came to be there.
Thank you, Mr. Secretary, you're on with Director Vance.
He said I was in trouble, didn't he?
- Actually...
- I mean, using government bandwidth to make private voice-over-IP phone calls...
I know that's against regulations.
Even if it was for charity.
To help Save the Children prevent the four million newborn deaths every year... four million!
Every year.
You know what?
I make no excuses.
I don't think the director wants to talk about Save the Children.
Then the infrastructure database that I loaned to Habitat for Humanity?
- Uh-uh.
- Okay, then that can just stay between us?
He already knows.
Huh.
So what is it?
Remember Alejandro Rivera, from the Justice Department in Mexico?
All of him.
He wants you to fly down to Mexico to speak at some law enforcement symposium
- their justice department is hosting.
- Nice!
When do I leave?
I think today.
But the director doesn't want you going alone.
Says Mexico is too dangerous these days.
So he's sending an escort.
Oh, God, as long as it's not McGee.
I mean, he's never any fun to travel with, anyways, and lately he's been acting all squirrelly ever since Alejandro tried to undress me with his eyes.
Hi.
The, uh, director wanted to see me?
Hey.
Is this it?
This is the location Abby gave us.
Right here.
By the truck?
According to Abby's coordinates in the truck.
Bet Abby could last longer than ten seconds playing random chat.
- You are obsessed.
- You wouldn't understand.
Why is that?
Because being irritating is second nature to you.
Me, I'm charming.
That's not charming.
That's a bloody table.
Tony...
- Buenos dias, Señorita.
- Hi.
Hey, Abbs, Abbs.
Slow down.
I don't want to miss anything.
Like what, the burrito bar?
Are you going to be a party pooper this entire trip, McGee?
Come on.
Señor.
You know, the last time I was in Mexico,
Montezuma got his revenge on me in a very, very big way.
I was sick for a month.
It's called bottled water, McGee.
Maybe this time you won't be so cheap.
You saw the text that Tony sent me.
I mean, look at that.
It's got to be a serial killer.
As soon as I go out of town,
- you know, they...
- Abby!
Bienvenido, Ms. Sciuto.
Hola.
Ah, so thrilled you could make it.
I trust your flight was pleasant?
Oh, it was.
Boy, my...
My arms sure are tired.
Not too tired, I hope.
You're going to need them.
Uh, for what?
Uh, we have a stack of old cold cases waiting for you, and a class of eager students hoping you will share your forensic expertise with them.
Sounds like I'm going to be busy.
Sí, but not so busy, perhaps, that you will not have time for...
Let's just say "busy," leave it at that.
Oh, I...
I apologize.
Agent McGoo, no?
McGee.
Ah.
Unfortunately, there is only one room available at the Justice Department's guest quarters.
Well, then, we'll check into a hotel.
Yeah, I do not recommend it.
The entire reason for this symposium is the escalating violence from the local drug wars.
I really must insist you stay here together, however distasteful we...
all may find it.
No regard for protocol.
Human remains are to be processed in the autopsy garage.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say serial killer.
A limb.
Nice.
Can I give you a hand?
These are terrible jokes.
You got time for jokes, do you, DiNozzo?
That mean you got our killer?
Uh, working on it.
License plate stolen, uh, VIN's been scraped off.
No prints.
There are over 1,000 similar registered vehicles with the Maryland DMV alone.
We'll narrow it down.
Corporal Collins was unconscious when he was dismembered.
It's safe to assume that, uh, these were, as well.
Or what's left of them.
And the rest of them?
I don't think that's soap scum.
Most likely sulfuric acid.
It is the only acid strong enough to dissolve bone.
Collins' body was dumped.
The rest of them weren't.
Why?
Well, I'd have to perform a psychological autopsy to answer that question.
But I can tell you one thing.
We have the killer's trophies, which means, well, he'll want to kill again.
We need to find out who he's targeting.
Think I got a lead on that.
Autopsy Gremlin?
Scram.
These look familiar.
Motorcycle gang tattoos.
Same here.
Same here.
Our killer's targeting bikers.
Ah.
This is gonna be fun.
I've always wanted to be a teacher.
Are you going to eat throughout my entire presentation?
Mm.
I read the local yogurt is amazing for your stomach.
True.
Lactobacillus aids in digestion.
However, that is unpasteurized.
Well, is that bad?
In Mexico?
You might as well just shoot yourself now.
Oh, here they come.
Hola.
Bienvenidos encantado.
¿ Como estás?
Buenos días.
Mucho gusto.
My name is Abby Sciuto.
I am a forensic scientist with the Naval
Criminal Investigative Service.
And this is...
That was Agent McGee, who just ate some unpasteurized yogurt, and he's probably gonna go make himself throw up.
Any questions?
Okay.
Well, today's lecture is on the forensics of cold cases.
We will be working on an actual case provided by your government.
It's the gangland hit of a drug trafficker, almost 20 years old.
Doesn't get much colder than that.
Any questions?
Yes.
Who told you the Day of the Dead was in May?
Your name is?
Let me guess.
Natalia.
You can read.
I can read.
I can also tell that you have cats.
Anyone could tell I have a cat.
One orange tabby and two calicos.
You're allergic to citrus.
You went bowling last night.
You're Vitamin D deficient.
Oh, and you're ovulating.
Any more questions?
Great.
Back to the case.
Which, because of some very shoddy police work, has almost no forensic evidence.
So I hope you brought your walking shoes, 'cause we are going in the field.
This is the last biker bar we're hitting today.
I'm starting to smell like monkey grease.
Somehow I think you won't mind this one.
Hello, kitty.
Meow.
Wow.
Want to take this, or should I?
- 'Cause I kind of got a feeling that...
- Mm.
You know what?
I got it.
I got it.
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention, please.
- Hi.
- Whatever.
I'm, uh, Special Agent Tony DiNozzo.
This is my partner.
We'd like to ask you some questions.
We're looking for information about this guy,
Corporal Ray Collins.
He was murdered, and he's... he's a very...
I've lost my mojo.
It's like random chat, only in the real world.
Perhaps it needs a woman's touch, so...
Not unless that woman's got a warrant.
You got a warrant?
No.
We would like to ask a few questions.
You know what I would like?
You to leave.
Look, people.
There is a serial killer on the loose.
He's targeting bikers.
Does that interest you?
Only thing that interests me is you... leaving now.
We're leaving now.
Okay.
Sorry about that.
Putting on a little show for the kiddies, huh?
If I wanted to stay in business, yeah.
Velvet Road.
Oh.
Tony.
Let's keep this quick.
Yes.
So any information on Corporal Collins?
Not much, but I have seen that guy around.
I don't know who he runs with, but I know who he's been sleeping with.
- Who's he been sleeping with?
- Everyone.
He probably slept with the wrong guy's girl.
Well, he's not the only one who's dead.
I'm not surprised.
I know some riders so jealous, you just look at their girl wrong, they'll kill you.
You got any names?
I got a whole bunch.
There are many ways by which a cold case can be solved.
Anyone?
Agent McGee.
Well, uh, new witnesses can step forward.
Alibis can fall through, or new information can come to light.
This new information usually comes from forensic evidence.
Which we're going to have to find on our own, because this case has virtually none.
What we know is this:
20 years ago, a traficante de drogos... a drug dealer named Pedro Hernandez... he left a cafe, he got in his vehicle to go home, and he was gunned down at point-blank range in a gang-style shooting.
His vehicle was abandoned after the incident, so that's where we're gonna start.
Lesson number one.
Beware shoddy police work.
For example, this fracture pattern.
It tells me that the bullet that shattered the glass was traveling at an unusually high velocity, which means?
Agent McGee?
Some kind of long-range weapon.
Which also means this police report is wrong.
He was not shot point-blank.
Are we expecting more students?
I don't think those are students.
You're trespassing.
This is public property.
We were just leaving.
Actually, no.
You're not.
Line up.
All of you.
It's probably a good time to start praying, too.
Uh, can we just slow down here for a second?
Sorry, I have lunch plans.
Would it help you to know that
I am a guest of your government?
- Abby.
- What?
Okay.
Maybe I won't kill you.
Maybe I take you hostage instead.
See how much you're worth.
My name is Timothy McGee.
I'm a United States federal agent.
I'm worth a lot to them, okay?
Now, you just let them go, you can keep me.
You're a brave man, Timothy McGee.
Do you know who I am?
No.
My name is Paloma Reynosa.
"Reynosa." As in?
Reynosa drug cartel.
At least, that's what you would call it.
I prefer to think of it as the family business.
We're screwed.
What's an NCIS agent doing so far from home?
He's my escort.
I'm teaching a class on the forensics of cold cases.
And this truck...
it's your classroom?
We're using the murder of a man named
Pedro Hernandez as a case study.
Old Pedro?
That was a long time ago.
What could you possibly learn now?
Well, for example, the police report... it's wrong.
He wasn't shot point-blank.
You are correct.
He was killed by a sniper, hiding on a ridge, almost a thousand meters from here.
How do you know that?
Because the killer left behind a message on that ridge.
What message?
Perhaps you will have more use for it than I.
I'll see what I can do.
Love your shoes.
Vamanos!
Thanks.
Jealousy can sure drive people to do strange things.
As can anything born of deep-rooted insecurity.
If I chopped the feet off of every guy that gave Breena two looks...
I would be up to my ears in toe cheese.
- What's that?
- Toe cheese.
Oh, right.
I hope you got something for me more than toe cheese, Duck.
Yes, well, we certainly have a lot of it.
Times like these, I regret not having a window.
Although we are saved from the more insidious odors by the fact that all these feet have been salted.
Killer preserving his trophies.
Which explains the mobile drying rack.
It's a good way of preventing the odors from alerting the neighbors.
Makes it more difficult to determine a time of death.
Difficult but not impossible.
Salt preservation retards bacterial growth, but not insect activity.
I was able to work out a rough timeline.
Uh, this one... was the first one cut off.
Roughly two months ago.
Good work.
However, unlike Corporal Collins, all of these victims were already dead before their feet were removed.
Vascular inflammation suggests that their deaths were caused by some kind of poison.
Abby will determine just what kind.
Serial killers usually don't change their MO.
Not after so many successful kills, no.
So, who do you think she was?
Well, I told you already.
Paloma Reynosa... head of the Reynosa drug cartel.
She took over after her husband died.
No, I mean who do you think she was to our cold case victim?
Probably somebody pretty important, considering she's been carrying around that bullet all this time.
Really don't know much about her.
Got a bad feeling about this case.
Yeah, I got a bad feeling about this bed.
You want to flip for the couch?
Come on, McGee.
It's not like we haven't shared a bed together before.
Well, technically, that was a coffin.
And I'm just letting you know that if you and I sleep in this bed together,
I am a Quasimodo for a week.
Now I know why Ziva took the couch in Paris.
Tony said that he took the couch in Paris.
Hmm.
Why do you think la policía didn't investigate this case further?
Well... he was a drug dealer.
And crimes like that...
a dime a dozen down here.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
I think I'm developing my own gut.
Yeah, I was going to mention to you, you look like you've put on a few pounds lately.
Come on.
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
All right, that was silly.
I'm sorry.
Look, you look great.
I mean,
I actually noticed that you've really looked great lately.
Actually.
Um...
Where are you going?
I'm going to sleep on my lab table.
Oh, come on.
I said I was sorry.
Oh... and you don't know how much.
What is that supposed to mean?
You forgot to use bottled water on your toothbrush.
This is not a room I want to sleep in tonight.
Hi!
Hey, baby.
I'm the kind of man that can rock your world.
Come meet the super freak.
I'm like a friendly dolphin.
Oh!
Come on!
You're pathetic.
I've tried everything.
Really.
No matter what I do, I can't get past ten seconds.
Well, maybe you should try something like working.
We are looking for a serial killer, Tony.
I already earned my pay today.
Really?
What did you find?
No way.
I tell you, you tell Gibbs...
I got nothing.
Look, I'm not gonna steal your discovery, okay?
I have my own.
Really?
What do you got?
No way.
If I tell you, you tell Gibbs.
Gibbs is gonna find out anyway.
Come on.
Let's see it.
Uh, well, our jealous biker theory was a dead end;
all our names had alibis.
We flashed Collins' picture at every motorcycle club in the city.
Got the same story from everyone.
- People saw him around.
- Yes, he comes and goes.
He never stays at one place for a long time.
And I think I know why.
Ray Collins, you're our serial killer.
On a hunch, I, uh, e-mailed his photo to several different sulfuric acid suppliers.
And bingo.
One of them recognized him.
Said that Corporal Collins bought a hundred gallons two months ago.
Circumstantial, Alice.
Well, circum... yeah, but...
Who's gonna have a picture of the guy driving the foot mo bile.
- You got a picture of the guy driving the foot mobile?
- Yes.
Making an illegal right turn on red.
I also had a hunch.
- Got a timeline match?
- Yes.
The killings started just after Corporal Collins returned from Afghanistan.
That's nice work.
Both of you.
Be even nicer if you could figure out who killed Collins.
Oh, my God.
Abby...
Morning.
I just heard what happened yesterday and came immediately to see how you were doing.
Oh, I'm okay.
Oh, I wish you would have told me your plans, so I could've said "no."
So do I.
The Reynosa drug cartel is having distribution problems at the moment.
It's very dangerous to go into their territory.
Though it appears your expedition provided some fruit.
Maybe.
As far as cold cases go, this one's frigid.
Oh, looks pretty warm to me.
"Lapua"?
It's a favorite of snipers, is it not?
I wouldn't draw any conclusions.
It's also popular with competitive shooters and, apparently, as jewelry.
Something is bothering you.
Whose idea was it for me to come down here?
Was it yours or was it Director Vance's?
Well, your director simply approved.
Oh, the idea was all mine.
Who assigned me this case?
Well, I don't know exactly.
Uh, someone on my staff.
Why?
How well do you know your staff?
Does this have something to do with your cold case?
You solved it?
No.
Not yet.
But if I'm going to...
I need you to exhume the body of Pedro Hernandez.
Oh, that could be arranged.
And I need it sent back to my people in DC.
They're the only ones I trust.
And we certainly wouldn't want to convict the wrong person.
No, of course not.
The body of a drug dealer from 20 years ago...
I don't think anyone will mind.
For you, I will make the arrangements.
Ah!
Hola, McTaco.
How was Mexico?
Did you bring anything back for me?
An exhumed corpse, 20 years old.
Like I wasn't sick enough already.
Where's Abby?
Uh, she's already in the lab, checking the DNA on your victims.
Since I heard we're not the only ones with an unsolved case.
We solved the serial killings.
- What?
- Oh, yeah.
You would've loved it.
Marine corporal poisoned his victims and then he cut off their feet...
bloody stumps.
Then he would take their bodies and put them in a vat of acid.
Yeah, and they would become these viscous, gooey, molten, fleshy, bowls of...
Of course, we still don't know who killed our killer.
Well, maybe it's, uh, it was for revenge.
Maybe it's one of the victim's family members?
Yeah.
It's Gibbs.
Or a copycat killer.
Corporal Collins' body was mutilated just like his victims.
I'm on my way, Duck.
Not much in Corporal Collins' background was actually helpful.
Go back over it.
Oh, we already went over it, boss.
Go back over it.
But we're going to go over it again.
Wanted to see me, Duck?
I do hope that's not another victim I haven't heard about.
A victim, yes, but not our case.
I'm helping Abby with one of hers.
It's a cold case from her Mexican symposium.
Ah.
Meet Pedro.
Remarkably well-preserved for a 20-year-old corpse.
Pedro, huh?
I believe so.
Mr. Palmer?
Uh, yep.
Pedro Hernandez.
Apparently, a sniper gunned him down outside a small town in Mexico.
The bullet that killed him ricocheted inside his skull... inside his skull...
inside his skull...
Abby thinks she might be able to trace the bullet, but... it's pretty old.
Abby, huh?
Yes, however, l-I didn't call you down here to discuss ancient history.
I've finished my psychological profile of our dead serial killer.
Although, I personally do not believe he was a serial killer.
Don't get me wrong, Jethro.
I don't doubt that Corporal Collins committed those murders, but he shows none of the psychopathology that normally motivates a serial killer.
Yeah, what motivated him?
I don't know.
And until we know that, we know nothing.
Aha!
Yeah.
I think I have it.
Ha-ha.
Jethro, if, uh, you would be so kind?
Mr. Palmer, would you run this up to Abby?
I got it, Duck.
I got it.
Oh, thank you, Jethro.
Gibbs.
Got one more computer to network to the search.
Hey, boss.
I just want to let you know
I am up to speed on this case.
McGee is helping me run the DNA from the serial killer's victims.
I got one more I.D. to make, and, uh, over here, program the computer to search for any similarities between the victims.
Is that another tissue sample?
No.
Okay, so, um, I identified the poison that the serial killer used to kill his victims.
It's a snake venom-derived neurotoxin.
It causes the rapid degeneration of a victim's synaptic nerves and then their death.
The snake itself is very rare...
the Asian sand viper.
Found exclusively in southwest Afghanistan, which was...
That's where Collins was stationed.
And with the amounts that he would've needed... easily could've gotten past military customs.
We got a ding.
Pardon me.
Okay.
All victims were members of a motorcycle gang.
Knew that.
All have various criminal records.
Figured that.
Oh, no, there is one, and only one, crime that they all have in common.
Our serial killer's targeting drug dealers.
Yeah, well, the problem is
Ducky doesn't think Collins was a serial killer.
He's cutting off people's feet.
Who does that other than serial killers?
I know who.
Drug cartels.
Well, by definition, wouldn't they be selling drugs and not feet?
Well, they do.
That's what all the recent controlling distribution.
Yeah... killing off your competition.
Exactly.
I mean, the cartels hire freelancers to do their hits.
The way that the hit men prove how many they've killed is with the severed feet of their victims.
Corporal Collins is not killing for fun.
No, he was killing for hire.
Then who killed him?
That's easy.
Whose drug dealers was he taking out?
Gonna have to send you on field trips more often, probie.
Though I am glad you're back.
Thanks, Tony.
It's nice to have someone to talk to for more than ten seconds at a time.
Yeah, um... about that.
All right, I programmed your browser to auto-next you out of video chats every ten seconds.
That wasn't nice.
Why would you do something like that?
I don't know.
Why would you create a fake online profile last year and make me fall in love with a girl that doesn't exist?
Can I get back to you on that?
You gonna tell me why I'm here?
I got ten dead bodies, all with one thing in common.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
You.
Sit down.
According to the DEA, they sold drugs for you.
Allegedly.
At least until Corporal Collins started killing them.
And that's why you killed him.
Doesn't look familiar.
How about that?
That look familiar?
Very nice ring you're wearing.
Any chance that there's still some of Collins' DNA in that?
Because I know we've got some of yours from underneath his fingernails.
You got this wrong.
Collins tried to kill me.
Tried to poison me with some kind of snake venom.
You don't look poisoned.
'Cause I'm immune.
These aren't just for show.
I own two pythons and a cobra.
I've been bit more times than I can count.
Two nights ago, I come home, have a drink.
And the next thing I knew, I wake up in some truck.
Collins was there.
Clocked him pretty good with a pipe.
Didn't mean to kill him.
It was an accident.
Was cutting off his feet an accident, too?
He was killing my dealers.
I had motive to take him out.
Who'd believe that it was self-defense?
I just tried to make it look like he was another serial killer victim.
Who hired him to take out your dealers?
I don't know.
They weren't local.
Who hired him?
!
I think it was the Reynosa cartel.
They're everywhere now.
Hi, Gibbs.
Hey, Abbs.
Can I come in?
Yeah.
You're already in.
Right.
Okay.
It was nice talking to you.
Abbs...
Why are you here?
You know why I'm here.
I matched the bullet in Pedro Hernandez' head to your sniper rifle.
You killed him.
In cold blood.
I mean, I know what he did, Gibbs.
He...
He killed your wife and your daughter.
But, Gibbs...
I know.
Gibbs doesn't do things like that.
Or-Or-Or does he?
Now I don't know.
I don't know anything.
The only thing that I do know is that I didn't find this out by accident.
Rule 40.
"If it seems like someone is out to get you, they are."
Just...
You have no idea how much I wish it was yesterday.
I mean, maybe if I could just close my eyes and open them again, it will be.
Do you realize the situation that I'm in now?
- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, do you understand
- the choice that I have to make now?
- I know.
Stop saying "I know."
What do you want me to say?
Tell me that I'm wrong.
Tell me that I made a mistake with the ballistics or...
No.
No, I can't say that.
Then... tell me how much I've been like a daughter to you... and how much you love me.
Will that help?
No.
What I really need to know, Gibbs is if you're going to love me, no matter what.
Why is everything rusted, Grandpa?
That's what happens when junk gets old.
Well, you're not rusted.
Well, I'm not junk and I'm not old.
You look old.
You want to live to see eight?
I'd just shut up, and pick something out, if I were you.
Do I really get to break anything I want?
It's your birthday.
Take a look around here, see if there's anything that catches your eye.
Oh, wow, Grandpa.
Yeah, figured that'd be just the ticket.
Come on, I got it all locked and loaded.
Let's see how these fit.
Cool.
Perfect.
There's your control panel.
Now, the most important thing about this, Tommy, is you do not tell your mother.
Okay.
What are you waiting for, some overtime?
Hit it!
Does it hurt?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah, it's a car.
It doesn't feel a thing.
Then why is it bleeding?
NCIS 7x22 Borderland Original Air Date on May 11, 2010
The First Amendment:
Freedom of the press, religion, assembly, petition and...
Yeah, well, you go get a life, too, you little pipsqueak!
...speech!
Clearly they did not have Tony in mind when writing that.
The little rat "nexted" me!
Hi, there.
Hey, I'm Tony.
What's he doing?
Annoying me.
Besides that.
It's called random chat.
It's through a Web site that video-connects you to random strangers.
Come on!
A person doesn't like who they're chatting with, they just hit next and move on.
Let me guess.
Tony keeps getting "nexted."
This I must see.
It's not funny, Ziva.
Longest I've gone is ten seconds.
Well, perhaps you're not as interesting as you think you are.
This from coming from a woman reading the Bill of Rights for entertainment- Get out of here.
Back off!
I don't want you taking credit when I work it out.
Hi, ladies.
Ew!
What are you, like 40?
!
Why would you want to talk to complete strangers anyway?
Okay, I'm just going to have to up my game here.
What can I do?
Finger puppets or maybe a furry... barnyard animal.
I got it!
Hah!
Never fails to please.
Hi, boss.
This isn't what it looks like.
Yeah?
Just out of curiosity, how exactly does this look?
It looks like we got a dead Marine.
Grab your gear.
And a little self-respect, DiNozzo.
You bring your laptop?
Yeah, why?
I bet I'd last longer than ten seconds in random chat with this guy as a badrop.
Oh, Tony, you really need to stop.
Will you stop?
I'm not stopping.
I stripped the car myself yesterday.
The trunk was empty.
Do you have any security cameras?
He's got tons of 'em.
But they're not hooked up to anything.
They're, uh, just for show.
What's that for?
Being brave.
And I also heard it's your birthday.
It is.
Uh, to whom do we have the misforne?
Marine Corporal Ray Collins.
Local LEOs identified him, called us.
Discarded in a junkyard like a piece of trash.
Did you know that the word "junk" originally referred to nautical old rope of uncertain origin?
Really!
Yes.
I did not know that.
Eventually, it included any discarded item.
That's fascinating.
No, I'll tell you what's fascinating.
Time of death, Duck?
Uh, Mr. Palmer, let's get our corporal to a more suitable work surface.
I'm guessing the killer dumps the body, hoping the trash compactor would eliminate the evidence.
I'm thinking mugging.
Cash and credit cards are missing.
Well, I might agree with you if that were the only thing missing.
Meet Corporal Ray Collins.
No family, single, and according to his CO, no friends.
But his fitness eval is off the charts.
Guessing that's when he had feet.
He was serving in southwestern Afghanistan until he was court-martialed.
Charges?
Everything.
Larceny, drug dealing, assault.
Might not've ended up doing time, but he was definitely looking at a dishonorable discharge.
We were unable to trace the corporal's movements prior to his murder.
No credit card use.
Didn't have a cell phone.
No ATM camera walk-bys either.
But look what I found.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet the Ducati Desmosedici Double-R.
DMV records indicate that Collins bought one last month.
Added it to his Harley collection.
Ray liked motorcycles.
Motorcycles he shouldn't be able to afford on his base pay.
He was into something.
Unfortunately, with his record, there are dozens of people with motive to kill him.
Talk to guys in his unit.
See if you can find one that actually did.
Me?
Like right now?
Yes, you.
Now.
Well, did the director say what it's about?
No, he didn't.
Can it wait like five minutes?
He wants you here now.
Why five minutes?
Because I had a breakthrough in the case, and if Gibbs' Gibbsometer is working, then he should be walking through my door any second.
All I know is that he wants you right now-
- I gotta go.
Do you know something I don't know?
Probably not.
Director Vance's office called and he wants to see me.
About what?
I don't know.
That's just the thing.
It's a bad omen, though.
I remember last time the director wanted to see me-- do you know about the last time the director wanted to see me?
No.
Okay, there's no sense in mentioning that again.
Abbs... you said you had a breakthrough?
About the case.
Right.
Work.
Focus.
Okay.
So,
Ducky found tissue underneath our victim's fingernails.
Most likely from the killer.
I ran the DNA.
No matches.
Doesn't sound much like a breakthrough.
Well, it's not.
But it is helpful.
Because all military DNA is on file.
Just means our killer wasn't in the military.
It rules out Director Vance.
Abby...
Right.
Work.
Okay, I heard that you were having trouble tracking Corporal Collin" movements the night of the murder.
Luckily, I haven't.
Because he was wearing this.
It's a state-of-the-art GPS runner's watch.
It tracks your progress, suggests routes.
It holds GPS data for 24 hours.
I can give you a blow-by-blow.
So, Corporal Collins, he went for a jog on base, and then he went to eat, he wandered around for a bit.
And then, for some reason, spent two hours standing in the middle of the street.
That's good work.
Get the address to Tony and Ziva.
Nice job.
What the biohazardous material is this?
It's all they had.
A mini-POW!
?
Ugh!
This is another bad omen.
Gibbs, this does not bode well for my future.
Abby, I wouldn't worry about it.
Why's that?
Because I got your back.
Always have had.
Always will.
I cried because I had no shoes.
Then I met a man who had no feet.
An old Persian proverb.
A reminder to appreciate what we have.
Because we can always have less.
Or how about, uh,
"Don't count your bowling balls before they're hatch, Fred."
Fred?
Uh, F-Fred Flintstone.
It's a... an unexpectedly profound series from the, uh-
- Agent Gibbs!
So good of you to join us.
To join, uh, Dr. Mallard in his autopsy, that I merely assist in.
Yabba-Dabba-Doo!
What do you got, Duck?
A mess.
And a troubling one.
Yes.
Dislocations across his entire skeletal system.
Likely caused by the car crusher.
That how he died?
No, he bled to death.
Collins was alive when his feet were cut off?
Alive, but I doubt conscious.
He also has a mandibular fracture.
That was not caused by the car crusher.
This particular trauma is consistent with a blow to the jaw with something heavy-- like a wrench or a piece of pipe.
So, someone knocked him out, and then chopped off his feet,
Sawed them off, actually.
For reasons I shall leave you to speculate.
You're right, Duck.
Troubling.
Oh, we haven't shown you the troubling part yet.
Mr. Palmer, would you, uh, turn his head.
It's some kind of welt.
Uh, to be honest, aside from being the sign of the Devil,
I have no idea what it is.
Or how it came to be there.
Thank you, Mr. Secretary, you're on with Director Vance.
He said I was in trouble, didn't he?
Actually...
I mean, using government bandwidth to make private voice-over IP phone calls,
I know that's against regulations.
Even if it was for charity.
To help Save the Children prevent the 4 million newborn deaths every year-- 4 million!
Every year!
You know what?
I make no excuses.
I don't think the director wants to talk about Save the Children.
Then the infrastructure database that I loaned to Habitat for Humanity?
Uh-uh.
Okay, then that can just stay between us?
He already knows.
Huh.
So what is it?
Remember Alejandro Rivera, from the Justice Department in Mexico?
All of him.
He wants you to fly down to Mexico to speak at some law enforcement symposium their justice department is hosting.
Nice!
When do I leave?
I think today.
But the director doesn't want you going alone.
Says Mexico is too dangerous these days.
So he's sending an escort.
Oh, God, as long as it's not McGee.
I mean, he's never any fun to travel with, anyways, and lately he's been acting all squirrelly ever since Alejandro tried to undress me with his eyes.
Hi.
The, uh, director wanted to see me?
Hey.
Is this it?
This is the location Abby gave us.
Right here.
By the truck?
According to Abby's coordinates in the truck.
Bet Abby could last longer than ten seconds playing random chat.
You are obsessed.
You wouldn't understand.
Why is that?
Because being irritating is second nature to you.
Me, I'm charming.
That's not charming.
That's a bloody table.
Tony...
Buenos dias, Señorita.
Hi.
Hey, Abbs, Abbs.
Slow down.
I don't want to miss anything.
Like what, the burrito bar?
Are you going to be a party pooper this entire trip, McGee?
Come on.
Señor.
You know, the last time I was in Mexico,
Montezuma got his revenge on me in a very, very big way.
I was sick for a month.
It's called bottled water, McGee.
Maybe this time you won't be so cheap.
You saw the text that Tony sent me.
I mean, look at that.
It's got to be a serial killer.
As soon as I go out of town, you know, they...
Abby!
Bienvenido, Ms. Sciuto.
Hola.
Ah, so thrilled you could make it.
I trust your flight was pleasant?
Oh, it was.
Boy, my...
My arms sure are tired.
Not too tired, I hope.
You're going to need them.
Uh, for what?
Uh, we have a stack of old cold cases waiting for you, and a class of eager students hoping you will share your forensic expertise with them.
Sounds like I'm going to be busy.
Sí, but not so busy, perhaps, that you will not have time for...
Let's just say busy and leave it at that.
Oh, I...
I apologize.
Agent McGoo, no?
McGee.
Ah.
Unfortunately, there is only one room available at the Justice Department's guest quarters.
Well, then, we'll check into a hotel.
Yeah, I do not recommend it.
The entire reason for this symposium is the escalating violence from the local drug wars.
I really must insist you stay here together, however distasteful we...
all may find it.
No regard for protocol.
Human remains are to be processed in the autopsy garage.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say serial killer.
A limb.
Nice.
Can I give you a hand?
These are terrible jokes.
You got time for jokes, do you, DiNozzo?
That mean you got our killer?
Uh, working on it.
License plate stolen, uh, VIN's been scraped off.
No prints.
There are over 1,000 similar registered vehicles with the Maryland DMV alone.
We'll narrow it down.
Corporal Collins was unconscious when he was dismembered.
It's safe to assume that, uh, these were, as well.
Or what's left of them.
And the rest of them?
I don't think that's soap scum.
Most likely sulfuric acid.
It is the only acid strong enough to dissolve bone.
Collins' body was dumped.
The rest of them weren't.
Why?
Well,
I'd have to perform a psychological autopsy to answer that question.
But I can tell you one thing.
We have the killer's trophies, which means, well, he'll want to kill again.
We need to find out who he's targeting.
Think I got a lead on that.
Autopsy Gremlin?
Scram.
These look familiar.
Motorcycle gang tattoos.
Same here.
Same here.
Our killer's targeting bikers.
Ah.
This is gonna be fun.
I've always wanted to be a teacher.
Are you going to eat throughout my entire presentation?
Mm.
I read the local yogurt is amazing for your stomach.
True.
Lactobacillus aids in digestion.
However, that is unpasteurized.
Well, is that bad?
In Mexico?
You might as well just shoot yourself now.
Oh, here they come.
Hola.
Bienvenidos encantado.
¿Como estás?
Buenos días.
Mucho gusto.
My name is Abby Sciuto.
I am a forensic scientist with the Naval
Criminal Investigative Service.
And this is...
That was Agent McGee, who just ate some unpasteurized yogurt, and he's probably gonna go make himself throw up.
Any questions?
Okay.
Well, today's lecture is on the forensics of cold cases.
We will be working on an actual case provided by your government.
It's the gangland hit of a drug trafficker, almost 20 years old.
Doesn't get much colder than that.
Any questions?
Yes.
Who told you the Day of the Dead was in May?
Your name is...?
Let me guess.
Natalia.
You can read.
I can read.
I can also tell that you have cats.
Anyone could tell I have a cat.
One orange tabby and two calicos.
You're allergic to citrus.
You went bowling last night.
You're Vitamin D deficient.
Oh, and you're ovulating.
Any more questions?
Great.
Back to the case.
Which, because of some very shoddy police work, has almost no forensic evidence.
So I hope you brought your walking shoes, 'cause we are going in the field.
This is the last biker bar we're hitting today.
I'm starting to smell like monkey grease.
Somehow I think you won't mind this one.
Hello kitty.
Meow.
Wow.
Want to take this, or should I?
'Cause I kind of got a feeling that...
Mm...
You know what?
I got it.
I got it.
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention, please.
Hi.
Whatever.
I'm, uh, Special Agent Tony DiNozzo.
This is my partner.
We'd like to ask you some questions.
We're looking for information about this guy,
Corporal Ray Collins.
He was murdered, and he's... he's a very...
I've lost my mojo.
It's like random chat, only in the real world.
Perhaps it needs a woman's touch, so...
Not unless that woman's got a warrant.
You got a warrant?
No.
We would like to ask a few questions.
You know what I would like?
You to leave.
Look, people.
There is a serial killer on the loose.
He's targeting bikers.
Does that interest you?
Only thing that interests me is you... leaving now.
We're leaving now.
Okay.
Sorry about that.
Putting on a little show for the kiddies, huh?
If I wanted to stay in business, yeah.
Velvet Road.
Oh.
Tony.
Let's keep this quick.
Yes.
So any information on Corporal Collins?
Not much, but I have seen that guy around.
I don't know who he runs with, but
I know who he's been sleeping with.
Who's he been sleeping with?
Everyone.
He probably slept with the wrong guy's girl.
Well, he's not the only one who's dead.
I'm not surprised.
I know some riders so jealous, you just look at their girl wrong, they'll kill you.
You got any names?
I got a whole bunch.
There are many ways by which a cold case can be solved.
Anyone?
Agent McGee...
Well, uh, new witnesses can step forward.
Alibis can fall through, or new information can come to light.
This new information usually comes from forensic evidence.
Which we're going to have to find on our own, because this case has virtually none.
What we know is this:
20 years ago, a traficante de drogos-- a drug dealer named Pedro Hernandez- he left a cafe, he got in his vehicle to go home, and he was gunned down at point-blank range in a gang-style shooting.
His vehicle was abandoned after the incident, so that's where we're gonna start.
Lesson number one.
Beware shoddy police work.
For example, this fracture pattern.
It tells me that the bullet that shattered the glass was traveling at an unusually high velocity, which means...?
Agent McGee?
Some kind of long-range weapon.
Which also means this police report is wrong.
He was not shot point-blank.
Are we expecting more students?
I don't think those are students.
You're trespassing.
This is public property.
We were just leaving.
Actually, no.
You're not.
Line up.
All of you.
It's probably a good time to start praying, too.
Uh, can we just slow down here for a second?
Sorry, I have lunch plans.
Would it help you to know that
I am a guest of your government?
Abby...
What?
Okay.
Maybe I won't kill you.
Maybe I take you hostage instead.
See how much you're worth.
My name is Timothy McGee.
I'm a United States federal agent.
I'm worth a lot to them, okay?
Now, you just let them go, you can keep me.
You're a brave man, Timothy McGee.
Do you know who I am?
No.
My name is Paloma Reynosa.
"Reynosa." As in...?
Reynosa drug cartel.
At least, that's what you would call it.
I prefer to think of it as the family business.
We're screwed.
What's an NCIS agent doing so far from home?
He's my escort.
I'm teaching a class on the forensics of cold cases.
And this truck...
it's your classroom?
We're using the murder of a man named
Pedro Hernandez as a case study.
Old Pedro?
That was a long time ago.
What could you possibly learn now?
Well, for example, the police report-- it's wrong.
He wasn't shot point-blank.
You are correct.
He was killed by a sniper, hiding on a ridge, almost a thousand meters from here.
How do you know that?
Beuse the killer left behind a message on that ridge.
What message?
Perhaps you will have more use for it than I.
I'll see what I can do.
Love youshoes.
Vamanos!
Thanks.
Jealousy can sure drive people to do strange things.
As can anything born of deep-rooted insecurity.
If I chopped the feet off of every guy that gave Breena two looks...
I would be up to my ears in toe cheese.
What's that?
Toe cheese.
Oh, right.
I hope you got something for me more than toe cheese, Duck.
Yes, well, we certainly have a lot of it.
Times like these I regret not having a window.
Although we are saved from the more insidious odors by the fact that all these feet have all been salted.
Killer preserving his trophies.
Which explains the mobile drying rack.
It's a good way of preventing the odors from alerting the neighbors.
Makes it more difficult to determine a time of death.
Difficult but not impossible.
Salt preservation retards bacterial growth but not insect activity.
I was able to work out a rough timeline.
Uh, this one... was the first one cut off.
Roughly two months ago.
Good work.
However, unlike Corporal Collins, all of these victims were already dead before their feet were removed.
Vascular inflammation suggests that their deaths were caused by some kind of poison.
Abby will determine just what kind.
Serial killers usually don't change their MO.
Not after so many successful kills, no.
So, who do you think she was?
Well, I told you already.
Paloma Reynosa-- head of the Reynosa drug cartel.
She took over after her husband died.
No, I mean who do you think she was to our cold case victim?
Probably somebody pretty important, considering she's been carrying around that bullet all this time.
Really don't know much about her.
Got a bad feeling about this case.
Yeah, I got a bad feeling about this bed.
You want to flip for the couch?
Come on, McGee.
It's not like we haven't shared a bed together before.
Well, technically, that was a coffin.
And I'm just letting you know, that if you and I sleep in this bed together,
I am a Quasimodo for a week.
Now I know why Ziva took the couch in Paris.
Tony said that he took the couch in Paris.
Hmm.
Why do you think la policía didn't investigate this case further?
Well, he was a drug dealer.
And crimes like that-- a dime a dozen down here.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
I think I'm developing my own gut.
Yeah, I was going to mention to you, you look like you've put on a few pounds lately.
Come on.
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
All right, that was silly.
I'm sorry.
Look, you look great.
I mean,
I actually noticed that you really look great lately.
Actually.
Um...
Where are you going?
I'm going to sleep on my lab table.
Oh, come on.
I said I was sorry.
Oh... and you don't know how much.
What is that supposed to mean?
You forgot to use bottled water on your toothbrush.
This is not a room
I want to sleep in tonight.
Hi!
Hey, baby.
I'm the kind of man that can rock your world.
Come meet the super freak.
I'm like a friendly dolphin.
Oh!
Come on!
You're pathetic.
I've tried everything.
Really.
No matter what I do, I can't get past ten seconds.
Well, maybe you should try something like working.
We are looking for a serial killer, Tony.
I already earned my pay today.
Really?
What did you find?
No way.
I tell you, you tell Gibbs- I got nothing.
Look, I'm not going to steal your discovery.
Okay?
I have my own.
Really?
What do you got?
No way.
If I tell you, you tell Gibbs.
Gibbs is gonna find out anyway.
Come on.
Let's see it.
Uh, well, our jealous biker theory was a dead end;
all our names had alibis.
We flashed Collins' picture at every motorcycle club in the city.
Got the same story from everyone.
People saw him around.
Yes, he comes and goes.
He never stays at one place for a long time.
And I think I know why.
Ray Collins, you're our serial killer.
On a hunch, I, uh, e-mailed his photo to several different sulfuric acid suppliers.
And bingo.
One of them recognized him.
Said that Corporal Collins bought a hundred gallons two months ago.
Circumstantial, Alice.
Well, circum-- yeah, but...
Who's gonna have a picture of the guy drive the foot mo bile.
You got a picture of the guy driving the foot mobile?
Yes.
Making an illegal right turn on red.
I also had a hunch.
Got a timeline match?
Yes.
The killings started just after Corporal Collins returned from Afghanistan.
That's nice work.
Both of you.
Be even nicer if you could figure out who killed Collins.
Oh, my God.
Abby...
Good morning.
I just heard what happened yesterday and came immediately to see how you were doing.
I just heard what Oh, I'm okay.
happened yesterday
Oh, I wish you would have told me your plans, so I could've said "no."
So do I.
The Reynosa drug cartel is having distribution problems at the moment.
It's very dangerous to go into their territory.
Though it appears your expedition provided some fruit.
Maybe.
As far as cold cases go, this one's frigid.
Oh, looks pretty warm to me.
"Lapua"?
It's a favorite of snipers, is it not?
I wouldn't draw any conclusions.
It's also popular with competitive shooters and, apparently, as jewelry.
Something is bothering you.
Whose idea was it for me to come down here?
Was it yours or was it Director Vance's?
Well, your director simply approved.
Oh, the idea was all mine.
Who assigned me this case?
Well, I don't know exactly.
Uh, someone on my staff.
Why?
How well do you know your staff?
Does this have something to do with your cold case?
You solved it?
No.
Not yet.
But if I'm going to...
I need you to exhume the body of Pedro Hernandez.
Oh, that could be arranged.
And I need it sent back to my people in DC.
They're the only ones I trust.
And we certainly wouldn't want to convict the wrong person.
No, of course not.
The "ody of a drug dealer from 20 years ago--
I don't think anyone will mind.
For you, I will make the arrangements.
Ah!
Hola, McTaco.
How was Mexico?
Did you bring anything back for me?
An exhumed corpse, 20 years old.
Like I wasn't sick enough already.
Where's Abby?
Uh, she's already in the lab, checking the DNA on your victims.
Since I heard we're not the only ones with an unsolved case.
We solved the serial killings.
What?
Oh, yeah.
You would've loved it.
Marine corporal poisoned his victims and then he cut off their feet- bloody stumps.
Then he would take their bodies and put them in a vat of acid.
Yeah, and they would become these viscous, gooey, molten, fleshy, bowls of...
Of course, we still don't know who killed our killer.
Well, maybe it's, uh, it was for revenge.
Maybe it's one of the victim's family members?
Yeah.
It's Gibbs.
Or a copycat killer.
Corporal Collins' body was mutilated just like his victims.
I'm on my way, Duck.
Not much in Corporal Collins' background was actually helpful.
Go back over it.
Oh, we already went over it, boss.
Go back over it.
But we're going to go over it again.
Wanted to see me, Duck?
I do hope that's not another victim I haven't heard about.
A victim, yes, but not our case.
I'm helping Abby with one of hers.
It's a cold case from her Mexican symposium.
Ah...
Meet Pedro.
Remarkably well-preserved for a 20-year-old corpse.
Pedro, huh?
I believe so.
Mr. Palmer?
Uh, yep.
Pedro Hernandez.
Yeah, apparently, a sniper gunned him down outside a small town in Mexico.
The bullet that killed him ricocheted inside his skull... inside his skull...
inside his skull...
Abby thinks she might be able to trace the bullet, but..
it's pretty old.
Abby, huh?
Yes, however, I didn't call you down here to discuss ancient history.
I've finished my psychological profile of our dead serial killer.
Although, I personally do not believe he was a serial killer.
Don't get me wrong, Jethro.
I don't doubt that Corporal Collins committed those murders, but he shows none of the psychopathology that normally motivates a serial killer.
Yeah, what motivated him?
I don't know.
And until we know that, we know nothing.
Aha!
Yeah.
I think I have it.
Ha-ha...
Jethro, if, uh, you would be so kind?
Mr. Palmer, would you run this up to Abby?
I got it, Duck.
I got it.
Oh, thank you, Jethro.
Gibbs.
Got one more computer to network to the search.
Hey, boss.
I just want to let you know
I am up to speed on this case.
McGee is helping me run the DNA from the serial killer's victims.
I got one more I.D. to make, and, uh, over here, program the computer to search for any similarities between the victims.
Is that another tissue sample?
No.
Okay, so, um, I identified the poison that the serial killer used to kill his victims.
It's a snake venom-derived neurotoxin.
It causes the rapid degeneration of the victim's synaptic nerves, and then their death.
The snake itself is very rare- the Asian sand-viper.
Found exclusively in southwest Afghanistan, which was...
That's where Collins was stationed.
The amounts he would've needed easily could've gotten past military customs.
We got a ding.
Pardon me.
Okay... all victims were members of a motorcycle gang.
Knew that.
All have various criminal records.
Figured that.
Oh, no, there is one, and only one, crime that they all have in common.
Our serial killer's targeting drug dealers.
Yeah, well, the problem is
Ducky doesn't think Collins was a serial killer.
He's cutting off people's feet.
Who does that other than serial killers?
I know who.
Drug cartels.
Well, by definition, wouldn't they be selling drugs and not feet?
Well, they do.
That's what the recent violence in Mexico's been about: controlling distribution.
Yeah... killing off your competition.
Exactly.
I mean, the cartels hire freelancers to do their hits, and the way that the hit men prove how many they've killed is with the severed feet of their victims.
Corporal Collins is not killing for fun.
No, he was killing for hire.
Then who killed him?
That's easy.
Whose drug dealers was he taking out?
Gonna have to send you on field trips more often, Probie.
Though I am glad you're back.
Thanks, Tony.
It's nice to have someone to talk to for more than ten seconds at a time.
Yeah, um... about that.
All right, I programmed your browser to auto-next you out of video chats every ten seconds.
That wasn't nice.
Why would you do something like that?
I don't know.
Why would you create a fake online profile last year and make me fall in love with a girl that doesn't exist?
Can I get back to you on that?
You gonna tell me why I'm here?
I got ten dead bodies, all with one thing in common.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
You.
Sit down.
According to the DEA, they sold drugs for you.
Allegedly.
At least until
Corporal Collins started killing them.
And that's why you killed him.
Doesn't look familiar.
How about that?
That look familiar?
Very nice ring you're wearing.
Any chance that there's still some of Collins' DNA in that?
Because I know we've got some of yours from underneath his fingernails.
VELVET ROAD You've got this wrong.
Collins tried to kill me.
Tried to poison me with some kind of snake venom.
You don't look poisoned.
'Cause I'm immune.
These aren't just for show.
I own two pythons and a cobra.
I've been bit more times than I can count.
Two nights ago, I come home, have a drink.
And the next thing I knew, I wake up in some truck.
Collins was there.
Clocked him pretty good with a pipe.
Didn't mean to kill him.
It was an accident.
Was cutting off his feet an accident, too?
He was killing my dealers.
I had motive to take him out.
Who'd believe that it was self-defense?
I just tried to make it look like he was another serial killer victim.
Who hired him to take out your dealers?
I don't know.
They weren't local.
Who hired him?
!
I think it was the Reynosa Cartel.
They're everywhere now.
Hi, Gibbs.
Hey, Abbs.
Can I come in?
Yeah.
You're already in.
Right.
Okay.
It was nice talking to you.
Abbs...
Why are you here?
You know why I'm here.
I matched the bullet in Pedro Hernandez' head to your sniper rifle.
You killed him.
In cold blood.
I mean, I know what he did, Gibbs.
He...
He killed your wife and your daughter.
But, Gibbs...
I know.
Gibbs doesn't do things like that.
Or-Or-Or does he?
Now I don't know.
I don't know anything.
The only thing that I do know is that I didn't find this out by accident.
Rule 40.
"If it seems like someone is out to get you, they are."
Just...
You have no idea how much I wished it was yesterday.
Maybe if I could just close my eyes and open them again, it will be.
Do you realize the situation that I'm in now?
Yeah, I know.
I mean, do you understand the choice that I have to make now?
I know.
Stop saying, "I know."
What do you want me to say?
Tell me that I'm wrong.
Tell me that I made a mistake with the ballistics or...
No.
No, I can't say that.
Then... tell me how much I've been like a daughter to you... and how much you love me.
Will that help?
No.
What I really need to know, Gibbs... is if you're going to love me, no matter what.
Why is everything rusted, Grandpa?
That's what happens when junk gets old.
Well, you're not rusted.
Well, I'm not junk and I'm not old.
You look old.
You want to live to see eight?
I'd just shut up, and pick something out, if I were you.
Do I really get to break anything I want?
It's your birthday.
Take a look around here, see if there's anything that catches your eye.
Oh, wow, Grandpa.
Yeah, figured that'd be just the ticket.
Come on, I got it all locked and loaded.
Let's see how these fit.
Cool.
Perfect.
There's your control panel.
Now, the most important thing about this, Tommy, is you do not tell your mother.
Okay.
What are you waiting for, some overtime?
Hit it!
Does it hurt?
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah, it's a car.
It doesn't feel a thing.
Then why is it bleeding?
NCIS 7x22 Borderland Original Air Date on May 11, 2010
The First Amendment:
Freedom of the press, religion, assembly, petition and...
Yeah, well, you go get a life, too, you little pipsqueak!
...speech!
Clearly they did not have Tony in mind when writing that.
The little rat "nexted" me!
Hi, there.
Hey, I'm Tony.
What's he doing?
Annoying me.
Besides that.
It's called random chat.
It's through a Web site that video-connects you to random strangers.
Come on!
A person doesn't like who they're chatting with, they just hit next and move on.
Let me guess.
Tony keeps getting "nexted."
This I must see.
It's not funny, Ziva.
Longest I've gone is ten seconds.
Well, perhaps you're not as interesting as you think you are.
This from coming from a woman reading the Bill of Rights for entertainment- Get out of here.
Back off!
I don't want you taking credit when I work it out.
Hi, ladies.
Ew!
What are you, like 40?
!
Why would you want to talk to complete strangers anyway?
Okay, I'm just going to have to up my game here.
What can I do?
Finger puppets or maybe a furry... barnyard animal.
I got it!
Hah!
Never fails to please.
Hi, boss.
This isn't what it looks like.
Yeah?
Just out of curiosity, how exactly does this look?
It looks like we got a dead Marine.
Grab your gear.
And a little self-respect, DiNozzo.
You bring your laptop?
Yeah, why?
I bet I'd last longer than ten seconds in random chat with this guy as a badrop.
Oh, Tony, you really need to stop.
Will you stop?
I'm not stopping.
I stripped the car myself yesterday.
The trunk was empty.
Do you have any security cameras?
He's got tons of 'em.
But they're not hooked up to anything.
They're, uh, just for show.
What's that for?
Being brave.
And I also heard it's your birthday.
It is.
Uh, to whom do we have the misforne?
Marine Corporal Ray Collins.
Local LEOs identified him, called us.
Discarded in a junkyard like a piece of trash.
Did you know that the word "junk" originally referred to nautical old rope of uncertain origin?
Really!
Yes.
I did not know that.
Eventually, it included any discarded item.
That's fascinating.
No, I'll tell you what's fascinating.
Time of death, Duck?
Uh, Mr. Palmer, let's get our corporal to a more suitable work surface.
I'm guessing the killer dumps the body, hoping the trash compactor would eliminate the evidence.
I'm thinking mugging.
Cash and credit cards are missing.
Well, I might agree with you if that were the only thing missing.
Meet Corporal Ray Collins.
No family, single, and according to his CO, no friends.
But his fitness eval is off the charts.
Guessing that's when he had feet.
He was serving in southwestern Afghanistan until he was court-martialed.
Charges?
Everything.
Larceny, drug dealing, assault.
Might not've ended up doing time, but he was definitely looking at a dishonorable discharge.
We were unable to trace the corporal's movements prior to his murder.
No credit card use.
Didn't have a cell phone.
No ATM camera walk-bys either.
But look what I found.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet the Ducati Desmosedici Double-R.
DMV records indicate that Collins bought one last month.
Added it to his Harley collection.
Ray liked motorcycles.
Motorcycles he shouldn't be able to afford on his base pay.
He was into something.
Unfortunately, with his record, there are dozens of people with motive to kill him.
Talk to guys in his unit.
See if you can find one that actually did.
Me?
Like right now?
Yes, you.
Now.
Well, did the director say what it's about?
No, he didn't.
Can it wait like five minutes?
He wants you here now.
Why five minutes?
Because I had a breakthrough in the case, and if Gibbs' Gibbsometer is working, then he should be walking through my door any second.
All I know is that he wants you right now-
- I gotta go.
Do you know something I don't know?
Probably not.
Director Vance's office called and he wants to see me.
About what?
I don't know.
That's just the thing.
It's a bad omen, though.
I remember last time the director wanted to see me-- do you know about the last time the director wanted to see me?
No.
Okay, there's no sense in mentioning that again.
Abbs... you said you had a breakthrough?
About the case.
Right.
Work.
Focus.
Okay.
So,
Ducky found tissue underneath our victim's fingernails.
Most likely from the killer.
I ran the DNA.
No matches.
Doesn't sound much like a breakthrough.
Well, it's not.
But it is helpful.
Because all military DNA is on file.
Just means our killer wasn't in the military.
It rules out Director Vance.
Abby...
Right.
Work.
Okay, I heard that you were having trouble tracking Corporal Collin" movements the night of the murder.
Luckily, I haven't.
Because he was wearing this.
It's a state-of-the-art GPS runner's watch.
It tracks your progress, suggests routes.
It holds GPS data for 24 hours.
I can give you a blow-by-blow.
So, Corporal Collins, he went for a jog on base, and then he went to eat, he wandered around for a bit.
And then, for some reason, spent two hours standing in the middle of the street.
That's good work.
Get the address to Tony and Ziva.
Nice job.
What the biohazardous material is this?
It's all they had.
A mini-POW!
?
Ugh!
This is another bad omen.
Gibbs, this does not bode well for my future.
Abby, I wouldn't worry about it.
Why's that?
Because I got your back.
Always have had.
Always will.
I cried because I had no shoes.
Then I met a man who had no feet.
An old Persian proverb.
A reminder to appreciate what we have.
Because we can always have less.
Or how about, uh,
"Don't count your bowling balls before they're hatch, Fred."
Fred?
Uh, F-Fred Flintstone.
It's a... an unexpectedly profound series from the, uh-
- Agent Gibbs!
So good of you to join us.
To join, uh, Dr. Mallard in his autopsy, that I merely assist in.
Yabba-Dabba-Doo!
What do you got, Duck?
A mess.
And a troubling one.
Yes.
Dislocations across his entire skeletal system.
Likely caused by the car crusher.
That how he died?
No, he bled to death.
Collins was alive when his feet were cut off?
Alive, but I doubt conscious.
He also has a mandibular fracture.
That was not caused by the car crusher.
This particular trauma is consistent with a blow to the jaw with something heavy-- like a wrench or a piece of pipe.
So, someone knocked him out, and then chopped off his feet,
Sawed them off, actually.
For reasons I shall leave you to speculate.
You're right, Duck.
Troubling.
Oh, we haven't shown you the troubling part yet.
Mr. Palmer, would you, uh, turn his head.
It's some kind of welt.
Uh, to be honest, aside from being the sign of the Devil,
I have no idea what it is.
Or how it came to be there.
Thank you, Mr. Secretary, you're on with Director Vance.
He said I was in trouble, didn't he?
Actually...
I mean, using government bandwidth to make private voice-over IP phone calls,
I know that's against regulations.
Even if it was for charity.
To help Save the Children prevent the 4 million newborn deaths every year-- 4 million!
Every year!
You know what?
I make no excuses.
I don't think the director wants to talk about Save the Children.
Then the infrastructure database that I loaned to Habitat for Humanity?
Uh-uh.
Okay, then that can just stay between us?
He already knows.
Huh.
So what is it?
Remember Alejandro Rivera, from the Justice Department in Mexico?
All of him.
He wants you to fly down to Mexico to speak at some law enforcement symposium their justice department is hosting.
Nice!
When do I leave?
I think today.
But the director doesn't want you going alone.
Says Mexico is too dangerous these days.
So he's sending an escort.
Oh, God, as long as it's not McGee.
I mean, he's never any fun to travel with, anyways, and lately he's been acting all squirrelly ever since Alejandro tried to undress me with his eyes.
Hi.
The, uh, director wanted to see me?
Hey.
Is this it?
This is the location Abby gave us.
Right here.
By the truck?
According to Abby's coordinates in the truck.
Bet Abby could last longer than ten seconds playing random chat.
You are obsessed.
You wouldn't understand.
Why is that?
Because being irritating is second nature to you.
Me, I'm charming.
That's not charming.
That's a bloody table.
Tony...
Buenos dias, Señorita.
Hi.
Hey, Abbs, Abbs.
Slow down.
I don't want to miss anything.
Like what, the burrito bar?
Are you going to be a party pooper this entire trip, McGee?
Come on.
Señor.
You know, the last time I was in Mexico,
Montezuma got his revenge on me in a very, very big way.
I was sick for a month.
It's called bottled water, McGee.
Maybe this time you won't be so cheap.
You saw the text that Tony sent me.
I mean, look at that.
It's got to be a serial killer.
As soon as I go out of town, you know, they...
Abby!
Bienvenido, Ms. Sciuto.
Hola.
Ah, so thrilled you could make it.
I trust your flight was pleasant?
Oh, it was.
Boy, my...
My arms sure are tired.
Not too tired, I hope.
You're going to need them.
Uh, for what?
Uh, we have a stack of old cold cases waiting for you, and a class of eager students hoping you will share your forensic expertise with them.
Sounds like I'm going to be busy.
Sí, but not so busy, perhaps, that you will not have time for...
Let's just say busy and leave it at that.
Oh, I...
I apologize.
Agent McGoo, no?
McGee.
Ah.
Unfortunately, there is only one room available at the Justice Department's guest quarters.
Well, then, we'll check into a hotel.
Yeah, I do not recommend it.
The entire reason for this symposium is the escalating violence from the local drug wars.
I really must insist you stay here together, however distasteful we...
all may find it.
No regard for protocol.
Human remains are to be processed in the autopsy garage.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say serial killer.
A limb.
Nice.
Can I give you a hand?
These are terrible jokes.
You got time for jokes, do you, DiNozzo?
That mean you got our killer?
Uh, working on it.
License plate stolen, uh, VIN's been scraped off.
No prints.
There are over 1,000 similar registered vehicles with the Maryland DMV alone.
We'll narrow it down.
Corporal Collins was unconscious when he was dismembered.
It's safe to assume that, uh, these were, as well.
Or what's left of them.
And the rest of them?
I don't think that's soap scum.
Most likely sulfuric acid.
It is the only acid strong enough to dissolve bone.
Collins' body was dumped.
The rest of them weren't.
Why?
Well,
I'd have to perform a psychological autopsy to answer that question.
But I can tell you one thing.
We have the killer's trophies, which means, well, he'll want to kill again.
We need to find out who he's targeting.
Think I got a lead on that.
Autopsy Gremlin?
Scram.
These look familiar.
Motorcycle gang tattoos.
Same here.
Same here.
Our killer's targeting bikers.
Ah.
This is gonna be fun.
I've always wanted to be a teacher.
Are you going to eat throughout my entire presentation?
Mm.
I read the local yogurt is amazing for your stomach.
True.
Lactobacillus aids in digestion.
However, that is unpasteurized.
Well, is that bad?
In Mexico?
You might as well just shoot yourself now.
Oh, here they come.
Hola.
Bienvenidos encantado.
¿Como estás?
Buenos días.
Mucho gusto.
My name is Abby Sciuto.
I am a forensic scientist with the Naval
Criminal Investigative Service.
And this is...
That was Agent McGee, who just ate some unpasteurized yogurt, and he's probably gonna go make himself throw up.
Any questions?
Okay.
Well, today's lecture is on the forensics of cold cases.
We will be working on an actual case provided by your government.
It's the gangland hit of a drug trafficker, almost 20 years old.
Doesn't get much colder than that.
Any questions?
Yes.
Who told you the Day of the Dead was in May?
Your name is...?
Let me guess.
Natalia.
You can read.
I can read.
I can also tell that you have cats.
Anyone could tell I have a cat.
One orange tabby and two calicos.
You're allergic to citrus.
You went bowling last night.
You're Vitamin D deficient.
Oh, and you're ovulating.
Any more questions?
Great.
Back to the case.
Which, because of some very shoddy police work, has almost no forensic evidence.
So I hope you brought your walking shoes, 'cause we are going in the field.
This is the last biker bar we're hitting today.
I'm starting to smell like monkey grease.
Somehow I think you won't mind this one.
Hello kitty.
Meow.
Wow.
Want to take this, or should I?
'Cause I kind of got a feeling that...
Mm...
You know what?
I got it.
I got it.
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could have your attention, please.
Hi.
Whatever.
I'm, uh, Special Agent Tony DiNozzo.
This is my partner.
We'd like to ask you some questions.
We're looking for information about this guy,
Corporal Ray Collins.
He was murdered, and he's... he's a very...
I've lost my mojo.
It's like random chat, only in the real world.
Perhaps it needs a woman's touch, so...
Not unless that woman's got a warrant.
You got a warrant?
No.
We would like to ask a few questions.
You know what I would like?
You to leave.
Look, people.
There is a serial killer on the loose.
He's targeting bikers.
Does that interest you?
Only thing that interests me is you... leaving now.
We're leaving now.
Okay.
Sorry about that.
Putting on a little show for the kiddies, huh?
If I wanted to stay in business, yeah.
Velvet Road.
Oh.
Tony.
Let's keep this quick.
Yes.
So any information on Corporal Collins?
Not much, but I have seen that guy around.
I don't know who he runs with, but
I know who he's been sleeping with.
Who's he been sleeping with?
Everyone.
He probably slept with the wrong guy's girl.
Well, he's not the only one who's dead.
I'm not surprised.
I know some riders so jealous, you just look at their girl wrong, they'll kill you.
You got any names?
I got a whole bunch.
There are many ways by which a cold case can be solved.
Anyone?
Agent McGee...
Well, uh, new witnesses can step forward.
Alibis can fall through, or new information can come to light.
This new information usually comes from forensic evidence.
Which we're going to have to find on our own, because this case has virtually none.
What we know is this:
20 years ago, a traficante de drogos-- a drug dealer named Pedro Hernandez- he left a cafe, he got in his vehicle to go home, and he was gunned down at point-blank range in a gang-style shooting.
His vehicle was abandoned after the incident, so that's where we're gonna start.
Lesson number one.
Beware shoddy police work.
For example, this fracture pattern.
It tells me that the bullet that shattered the glass was traveling at an unusually high velocity, which means...?
Agent McGee?
Some kind of long-range weapon.
Which also means this police report is wrong.
He was not shot point-blank.
Are we expecting more students?
I don't think those are students.
You're trespassing.
This is public property.
We were just leaving.
Actually, no.
You're not.
Line up.
All of you.
It's probably a good time to start praying, too.
Uh, can we just slow down here for a second?
Sorry, I have lunch plans.
Would it help you to know that
I am a guest of your government?
Abby...
What?
Okay.
Maybe I won't kill you.
Maybe I take you hostage instead.
See how much you're worth.
My name is Timothy McGee.
I'm a United States federal agent.
I'm worth a lot to them, okay?
Now, you just let them go, you can keep me.
You're a brave man, Timothy McGee.
Do you know who I am?
No.
My name is Paloma Reynosa.
"Reynosa." As in...?
Reynosa drug cartel.
At least, that's what you would call it.
I prefer to think of it as the family business.
We're screwed.
What's an NCIS agent doing so far from home?
He's my escort.
I'm teaching a class on the forensics of cold cases.
And this truck...
it's your classroom?
We're using the murder of a man named
Pedro Hernandez as a case study.
Old Pedro?
That was a long time ago.
What could you possibly learn now?
Well, for example, the police report-- it's wrong.
He wasn't shot point-blank.
You are correct.
He was killed by a sniper, hiding on a ridge, almost a thousand meters from here.
How do you know that?
Beuse the killer left behind a message on that ridge.
What message?
Perhaps you will have more use for it than I.
I'll see what I can do.
Love youshoes.
Vamanos!
Thanks.
Jealousy can sure drive people to do strange things.
As can anything born of deep-rooted insecurity.
If I chopped the feet off of every guy that gave Breena two looks...
I would be up to my ears in toe cheese.
What's that?
Toe cheese.
Oh, right.
I hope you got something for me more than toe cheese, Duck.
Yes, well, we certainly have a lot of it.
Times like these I regret not having a window.
Although we are saved from the more insidious odors by the fact that all these feet have all been salted.
Killer preserving his trophies.
Which explains the mobile drying rack.
It's a good way of preventing the odors from alerting the neighbors.
Makes it more difficult to determine a time of death.
Difficult but not impossible.
Salt preservation retards bacterial growth but not insect activity.
I was able to work out a rough timeline.
Uh, this one... was the first one cut off.
Roughly two months ago.
Good work.
However, unlike Corporal Collins, all of these victims were already dead before their feet were removed.
Vascular inflammation suggests that their deaths were caused by some kind of poison.
Abby will determine just what kind.
Serial killers usually don't change their MO.
Not after so many successful kills, no.
So, who do you think she was?
Well, I told you already.
Paloma Reynosa-- head of the Reynosa drug cartel.
She took over after her husband died.
No, I mean who do you think she was to our cold case victim?
Probably somebody pretty important, considering she's been carrying around that bullet all this time.
Really don't know much about her.
Got a bad feeling about this case.
Yeah, I got a bad feeling about this bed.
You want to flip for the couch?
Come on, McGee.
It's not like we haven't shared a bed together before.
Well, technically, that was a coffin.
And I'm just letting you know, that if you and I sleep in this bed together,
I am a Quasimodo for a week.
Now I know why Ziva took the couch in Paris.
Tony said that he took the couch in Paris.
Hmm.
Why do you think la policía didn't investigate this case further?
Well, he was a drug dealer.
And crimes like that-- a dime a dozen down here.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
I think I'm developing my own gut.
Yeah, I was going to mention to you, you look like you've put on a few pounds lately.
Come on.
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
All right, that was silly.
I'm sorry.
Look, you look great.
I mean,
I actually noticed that you really look great lately.
Actually.
Um...
Where are you going?
I'm going to sleep on my lab table.
Oh, come on.
I said I was sorry.
Oh... and you don't know how much.
What is that supposed to mean?
You forgot to use bottled water on your toothbrush.
This is not a room
I want to sleep in tonight.
Hi!
Hey, baby.
I'm the kind of man that can rock your world.
Come meet the super freak.
I'm like a friendly dolphin.
Oh!
Come on!
You're pathetic.
I've tried everything.
Really.
No matter what I do, I can't get past ten seconds.
Well, maybe you should try something like working.
We are looking for a serial killer, Tony.
I already earned my pay today.
Really?
What did you find?
No way.
I tell you, you tell Gibbs- I got nothing.
Look, I'm not going to steal your discovery.
Okay?
I have my own.
Really?
What do you got?
No way.
If I tell you, you tell Gibbs.
Gibbs is gonna find out anyway.
Come on.
Let's see it.
Uh, well, our jealous biker theory was a dead end;
all our names had alibis.
We flashed Collins' picture at every motorcycle club in the city.
Got the same story from everyone.
People saw him around.
Yes, he comes and goes.
He never stays at one place for a long time.
And I think I know why.
Ray Collins, you're our serial killer.
On a hunch, I, uh, e-mailed his photo to several different sulfuric acid suppliers.
And bingo.
One of them recognized him.
Said that Corporal Collins bought a hundred gallons two months ago.
Circumstantial, Alice.
Well, circum-- yeah, but...
Who's gonna have a picture of the guy drive the foot mo bile.
You got a picture of the guy driving the foot mobile?
Yes.
Making an illegal right turn on red.
I also had a hunch.
Got a timeline match?
Yes.
The killings started just after Corporal Collins returned from Afghanistan.
That's nice work.
Both of you.
Be even nicer if you could figure out who killed Collins.
Oh, my God.
Abby...
Good morning.
I just heard what happened yesterday and came immediately to see how you were doing.
I just heard what Oh, I'm okay.
happened yesterday
Oh, I wish you would have told me your plans, so I could've said "no."
So do I.
The Reynosa drug cartel is having distribution problems at the moment.
It's very dangerous to go into their territory.
Though it appears your expedition provided some fruit.
Maybe.
As far as cold cases go, this one's frigid.
Oh, looks pretty warm to me.
"Lapua"?
It's a favorite of snipers, is it not?
I wouldn't draw any conclusions.
It's also popular with competitive shooters and, apparently, as jewelry.
Something is bothering you.
Whose idea was it for me to come down here?
Was it yours or was it Director Vance's?
Well, your director simply approved.
Oh, the idea was all mine.
Who assigned me this case?
Well, I don't know exactly.
Uh, someone on my staff.
Why?
How well do you know your staff?
Does this have something to do with your cold case?
You solved it?
No.
Not yet.
But if I'm going to...
I need you to exhume the body of Pedro Hernandez.
Oh, that could be arranged.
And I need it sent back to my people in DC.
They're the only ones I trust.
And we certainly wouldn't want to convict the wrong person.
No, of course not.
The "ody of a drug dealer from 20 years ago--
I don't think anyone will mind.
For you, I will make the arrangements.
Ah!
Hola, McTaco.
How was Mexico?
Did you bring anything back for me?
An exhumed corpse, 20 years old.
Like I wasn't sick enough already.
Where's Abby?
Uh, she's already in the lab, checking the DNA on your victims.
Since I heard we're not the only ones with an unsolved case.
We solved the serial killings.
What?
Oh, yeah.
You would've loved it.
Marine corporal poisoned his victims and then he cut off their feet- bloody stumps.
Then he would take their bodies and put them in a vat of acid.
Yeah, and they would become these viscous, gooey, molten, fleshy, bowls of...
Of course, we still don't know who killed our killer.
Well, maybe it's, uh, it was for revenge.
Maybe it's one of the victim's family members?
Yeah.
It's Gibbs.
Or a copycat killer.
Corporal Collins' body was mutilated just like his victims.
I'm on my way, Duck.
Not much in Corporal Collins' background was actually helpful.
Go back over it.
Oh, we already went over it, boss.
Go back over it.
But we're going to go over it again.
Wanted to see me, Duck?
I do hope that's not another victim I haven't heard about.
A victim, yes, but not our case.
I'm helping Abby with one of hers.
It's a cold case from her Mexican symposium.
Ah...
Meet Pedro.
Remarkably well-preserved for a 20-year-old corpse.
Pedro, huh?
I believe so.
Mr. Palmer?
Uh, yep.
Pedro Hernandez.
Yeah, apparently, a sniper gunned him down outside a small town in Mexico.
The bullet that killed him ricocheted inside his skull... inside his skull...
inside his skull...
Abby thinks she might be able to trace the bullet, but..
it's pretty old.
Abby, huh?
Yes, however, I didn't call you down here to discuss ancient history.
I've finished my psychological profile of our dead serial killer.
Although, I personally do not believe he was a serial killer.
Don't get me wrong, Jethro.
I don't doubt that Corporal Collins committed those murders, but he shows none of the psychopathology that normally motivates a serial killer.
Yeah, what motivated him?
I don't know.
And until we know that, we know nothing.
Aha!
Yeah.
I think I have it.
Ha-ha...
Jethro, if, uh, you would be so kind?
Mr. Palmer, would you run this up to Abby?
I got it, Duck.
I got it.
Oh, thank you, Jethro.
Gibbs.
Got one more computer to network to the search.
Hey, boss.
I just want to let you know
I am up to speed on this case.
McGee is helping me run the DNA from the serial killer's victims.
I got one more I.D. to make, and, uh, over here, program the computer to search for any similarities between the victims.
Is that another tissue sample?
No.
Okay, so, um, I identified the poison that the serial killer used to kill his victims.
It's a snake venom-derived neurotoxin.
It causes the rapid degeneration of the victim's synaptic nerves, and then their death.
The snake itself is very rare- the Asian sand-viper.
Found exclusively in southwest Afghanistan, which was...
That's where Collins was stationed.
The amounts he would've needed easily could've gotten past military customs.
We got a ding.
Pardon me.
Okay... all victims were members of a motorcycle gang.
Knew that.
All have various criminal records.
Figured that.
Oh, no, there is one, and only one, crime that they all have in common.
Our serial killer's targeting drug dealers.
Yeah, well, the problem is
Ducky doesn't think Collins was a serial killer.
He's cutting off people's feet.
Who does that other than serial killers?
I know who.
Drug cartels.
Well, by definition, wouldn't they be selling drugs and not feet?
Well, they do.
That's what the recent violence in Mexico's been about: controlling distribution.
Yeah... killing off your competition.
Exactly.
I mean, the cartels hire freelancers to do their hits, and the way that the hit men prove how many they've killed is with the severed feet of their victims.
Corporal Collins is not killing for fun.
No, he was killing for hire.
Then who killed him?
That's easy.
Whose drug dealers was he taking out?
Gonna have to send you on field trips more often, Probie.
Though I am glad you're back.
Thanks, Tony.
It's nice to have someone to talk to for more than ten seconds at a time.
Yeah, um... about that.
All right, I programmed your browser to auto-next you out of video chats every ten seconds.
That wasn't nice.
Why would you do something like that?
I don't know.
Why would you create a fake online profile last year and make me fall in love with a girl that doesn't exist?
Can I get back to you on that?
You gonna tell me why I'm here?
I got ten dead bodies, all with one thing in common.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
You.
Sit down.
According to the DEA, they sold drugs for you.
Allegedly.
At least until
Corporal Collins started killing them.
And that's why you killed him.
Doesn't look familiar.
How about that?
That look familiar?
Very nice ring you're wearing.
Any chance that there's still some of Collins' DNA in that?
Because I know we've got some of yours from underneath his fingernails.
VELVET ROAD You've got this wrong.
Collins tried to kill me.
Tried to poison me with some kind of snake venom.
You don't look poisoned.
'Cause I'm immune.
These aren't just for show.
I own two pythons and a cobra.
I've been bit more times than I can count.
Two nights ago, I come home, have a drink.
And the next thing I knew, I wake up in some truck.
Collins was there.
Clocked him pretty good with a pipe.
Didn't mean to kill him.
It was an accident.
Was cutting off his feet an accident, too?
He was killing my dealers.
I had motive to take him out.
Who'd believe that it was self-defense?
I just tried to make it look like he was another serial killer victim.
Who hired him to take out your dealers?
I don't know.
They weren't local.
Who hired him?
!
I think it was the Reynosa Cartel.
They're everywhere now.
Hi, Gibbs.
Hey, Abbs.
Can I come in?
Yeah.
You're already in.
Right.
Okay.
It was nice talking to you.
Abbs...
Why are you here?
You know why I'm here.
I matched the bullet in Pedro Hernandez' head to your sniper rifle.
You killed him.
In cold blood.
I mean, I know what he did, Gibbs.
He...
He killed your wife and your daughter.
But, Gibbs...
I know.
Gibbs doesn't do things like that.
Or-Or-Or does he?
Now I don't know.
I don't know anything.
The only thing that I do know is that I didn't find this out by accident.
Rule 40.
"If it seems like someone is out to get you, they are."
Just...
You have no idea how much I wished it was yesterday.
Maybe if I could just close my eyes and open them again, it will be.
Do you realize the situation that I'm in now?
Yeah, I know.
I mean, do you understand the choice that I have to make now?
I know.
Stop saying, "I know."
What do you want me to say?
Tell me that I'm wrong.
Tell me that I made a mistake with the ballistics or...
No.
No, I can't say that.
Then... tell me how much I've been like a daughter to you... and how much you love me.
Will that help?
No.
What I really need to know, Gibbs... is if you're going to love me, no matter what.
So, everyone's going to the park to celebrate the last day of school!
I don't feel like celebrating.
I still haven't heard from Amy.
I think I maybe wanna stay a day or two extra at the end of the program.
Maybe you could think about me flying to New York at the end of the program just like all the other dads are doing.
Amy, is that really you?
I'm just calling to let you know that I will talk to you at some point but not over the phone.
I don't know if I can not call you for two more weeks.
I wanna do something with you that you haven't done with her.
Something else like what?
Spend the night at Grace's guest house.
I wanna be a doctor.
I wanna be a doctor.
No way.
The only girl I'm interested in is Amy.
Well, I've got news for you.
Ricky's flying to New York to see Amy this weekend.
What?
It's really good to see you, Amy.
Good morning, Doctor.
This is my baby.
And I'm just going to accept that this is my fate, and I'm gonna marry Adrian and learn to love her.
Could we ever have sex again?
Could you ever not sleep with every girl you got the chance to sleep with?
I'm working on that.
Ricky, it's one thing to say that.
It's another thing to actually not do it.
I just thought I'd call.
Oh, for no apparent reason?
No.
Just wanted to say hi, see how you are.
Thanks, Adrian.
I've been wondering how you are, too.
Really?
I would've thought Ricky would've told you this weekend how I am.
Oh, no.
We really didn't have a lot of time to talk about you.
Oh?
Why is that?
He was only here for a short time, and we had a lot to discuss.
Like?
Like stuff about John.
So how are you?
How are you feeling?
Just like I told Ricky last week when he came over and stayed half the night talking to me,
I'm feeling good, really good.
So no more morning sickness?
No.
You know,
Ben was really upset that Ricky just took off and flew to New York without telling him.
He still loves you.
Ben.
He's a nice guy...
Ben.
I'm sure he'll be a responsible dad.
I'm sure.
You know, my dad really wants us to get married.
I mean, how crazy is that...
Ben and me married?
I mean, everyone knows that he's in love with you.
He's always been in love with you, just like Ricky's always kind of been in love with me, you know?
Yeah.
Well, babies have a way of making relationships change whether you want the relationship to change or not.
What do you mean by that?
I mean, relationships change.
Things happen, babies are born.
Then the babies grow up.
Sometimes so do the parents.
Are you telling me I need to grow up?
Is that what you're saying?
Oh, no, no, no.
That's not what I'm saying at all.
I'm sorry you took it that way.
Please don't take it that way, Adrian.
I really want us to be friends.
And I think we have a good shot at being friends.
I do, because it's a very difficult experience having a baby in high school, and, you know, girls tend to relate to each other based on common experiences.
Well, we also have the common experiences of Ben and Ricky.
Actually, I've never had sex with Ben, remember?
Oh, yeah.
I forgot.
Well, he surprised me.
It was a lot of fun.
It was the only time I've ever seen him let loose and enjoy himself.
I don't think we should be talking about what the two of you did.
It's all very personal and private and all that.
I'm just saying maybe you should sleep with him.
Adrian, I don't think I'm gonna have sex again with anyone I'm not marrying.
You and Ricky... you're not thinking of getting married, are you?
You didn't get married this past weekend, did you?
Adrian, Ricky and I decided to keep what happened this weekend between the two of us.
But then you'll tell Lauren and Madison, and Madison will tell Jack, and Jack will tell Grace, and she'll tell Ben, so you might as well just tell me.
Can't.
Sorry.
Why don't we talk about something else?
Because I wanna know what's going on between you and Ricky, and I would think you would wanna know what's going on between me and Ricky.
No.
No, that's between Ricky and you.
Just tell me!
Closing time.
Good night, and good luck, and may the best man win, and may that be before you two come back tomorrow.
What's that supposed to mean...
"May the best man win"?
Trying to make light of a dark situation.
It's not funny.
He saw Amy.
He went to New York this weekend and didn't even tell me that he was going.
It wasn't any of your business.
And you know what?
It's still not any of your business.
Or any of mine.
The only thing that's my business is this butcher shop.
And if the two of you wanna keep your jobs,
I suggest you get together and talk it out and come back tomorrow with a new attitude before I give you your walking papers.
How are we supposed to talk about anything when everything is none of my business?
It's between Amy and me, okay?
Fine.
Amy will tell Madison and Lauren what happened,
Madison will tell Jack, Jack will tell Grace, and Grace will tell me.
But I'm not gonna tell you.
I'm gonna tell you both one more time.
Talk it out outside of the shop and come back tomorrow with a new attitude.
Tell me.
Tell me.
Tell me!
You're fired.
Both of us?
So, are you and Amy getting back together?
If I don't sleep with any other women for the rest of my life, maybe.
Hi, Adrian.
* Falling in love *
* Is such an easy thing to do *
* Birds can do it We can do it *
* Let's stop talking Let's get to it *
* Let's fall in love *
So she didn't call you?
No, she didn't call me, she texted me.
Did they have a good time?
What?
Just wondering.
Just wondering because...
Uh-huh.
Because Grace wants to know if they had a good time.
No, not Grace, Ben.
Ben asked Grace to find out, and she asked me to find out, and now I'm asking you.
You know you're gonna tell me sooner or later, so why don't you just tell me now?
Give me something general, like he slept in a hotel because they got into a huge fight or something like that.
He didn't sleep at a hotel.
He spent the night with her?
You tricked me.
And so what if they spent the night in the same room together?
So did we.
We didn't do anything.
Hey.
What are you doing in here?
Nothing.
Something.
Nothing.
Is that your phone?
This one?
No.
This isn't my phone.
This is Madison's phone.
She left it at home.
I was just returning it to her room.
Are you reading her text messages while you return it to her room?
I have a good reason.
Excuse.
Lauren's dad called me.
Hey, Dad.
You startled me.
What are you doing here?
I just came by to say hello to you and your brother.
Mom and David took Jason out to get some stuff for med camp.
He wants to look all professional this year.
Last year, apparently he took a lot of shorts and no one was wearing shorts, and...
What'd I do?
I don't know.
What did you do?
I didn't do anything.
Maybe you did, and maybe you didn't, but when I was talking to Jason yesterday, he said you spent the night at Madison's Friday night.
I've spent the night over at Madison's lots of Friday nights.
Yeah, but I don't think you spent the night over there last Friday night.
And before you say anything, let me ready you an e-mail I got from you yesterday.
"I hope no one finds out
"we're at that guest house.
"You better not tell anyone...
"anyone... we're at that guest house because my parents would kill me."
What guest house would that be?
What e-mail would that be?
The one obviously intended for Madison.
Rats.
How did I do that?
I don't know, but you did do that.
What guest house?
Jack's guest house.
You spent the night at Jack's guest house with Jessie.
It wasn't quite like that.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Put that on hold.
Who are you texting?
Madison?
Yes.
Lauren, I'm surprised at you.
Me, too.
What did you do?
Hey, Dad.
Jason.
Get out of here.
Don't you wanna see my new shirts?
No, I don't.
Hi, Kenny.
How's it hanging?
Hi, Dave.
Do you mind, both of you?
I'd like a few minutes to talk to my daughter alone.
Is this a family matter?
Because Lauren's my daughter, too.
Not really.
No, she isn't.
Not for purposes of this discussion she's not.
Ooh.
You really stepped in it, didn't you?
What's going on?
Jason, out.
Bye.
Is there a problem?
I can handle it.
I'm sure you can, but...
Hey, surgeons don't operate on their own family members, so maybe you shouldn't...
Maybe I shouldn't what?
Do you want me to stay here?
You want me to stick around?
No, Dave.
Thanks, but no.
Because if you want me...
She doesn't want you, Dave.
Thank you for that.
I really think this should be between the two of us.
You mean, between the three of us, don't you?
Dad and I need to talk, just the two of us.
Well, I'll decide that.
Look, I just wanna talk to my daughter, all right?
So you came all the way over to the house, unannounced, to talk to our daughter about what?
I spent the night with Jessie over at Jack's guest house.
But we didn't do anything.
You lied?
You lied to me and told me that you were spending the night at Madison's, so I don't know if I care if anything more than that happened or not.
You are on restriction, young lady, for the summer.
No Jessie, okay?
The two of you are not gonna spend this summer doing what I know you want to do.
So no Jessie.
And next time, call.
You're supposed to call me before you just drop by over here.
That's our agreement.
I didn't do anything.
They're right outside.
Put that down.
I pay for the phone.
Put it down.
Put it on the bed and back away, Morgan, before anyone gets hurt.
Uh, what's going on?
Red alert from Lauren.
You tell me.
What are you doing with my phone?
I'll let you two talk.
No, you can stay.
I don't wanna be in the middle of this one.
What one?
Were you reading my text messages?
I got a call from Lauren's dad asking if she slept over here on Friday night.
Um, I... slept over... not here Friday night.
Where?
You slept over where on Friday night?
Okay, I slept at Jack's guest house, but we didn't do anything.
I slept on the bottom bunk with Lauren, and Jessie was on top.
On the top bunk.
And Jack was all the way across the room in a chair and so was Tom.
You lied.
That's the thing, Madison.
You lied.
All right.
I...
I lied, but only because I knew you wouldn't let me do what I really wanted to do.
Uh-oh.
And that would be?
I want to go to Phoenix with Jack for a week to visit his parents.
No.
Okay, that's it.
That's the end of you and Jack right there with that.
Oh, no.
What?
Emily, if she wants to act like a little child and stomp her foot because she doesn't get her way, then she's certainly not old enough to spend a week away with her boyfriend.
She's not even old enough to have a boyfriend.
Morgan...
Emily.
Well, you can't stop me.
Madison.
Emily.
Really, Madison, you are just too young to have a serious boyfriend, and you're too young to have friends with babies.
And you're not gonna have a baby because you're not gonna see Jack anymore, and that is it.
Can I have my phone back, please?
And who are you texting?
Lauren.
To tell her that we're not gonna be friends anymore.
And you know what?
We're not gonna be friends anymore either.
I don't wanna be your friend.
I am not your friend.
I am your father.
Hi, Amy.
Hey, Lauren.
What's up?
Nothing good.
Oh.
Well, I'm sorry I didn't text you back.
I just thought I'd call.
I miss you.
My dad's over here.
He just screwed up my entire life in one visit.
Your dad dad?
That one.
How?
Oh, I e-mailed him by mistake.
I was e-mailing him and e-mailing Jessie and e-mailing Madison, all of them one after the other.
I guess an e-mail I thought I sent to Madison went to him.
Oh, that's too bad.
I'm sorry.
What did it say?
Oh, wait.
I have another call.
Can you hang on?
It's probably just Madison.
I'm glad you're still speaking to her, because I'm not speaking to her.
Oh, and you wanna know something else?
Amy?
You there?
And now he tells me that we can't be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore because he thinks we're gonna do something stupid like get pregnant.
Yeah.
That is a pretty stupid thing to do.
Can I call you back?
I have Lauren on the other line.
Oh, that is so just like her to try to get to you first.
And I didn't mean stupid.
That was a bad choice of words.
Uh...
Hello?
Amy?
Hey.
Here you are.
Oh, hi.
I was just talking to some friends back home.
Hang up.
You're going out with us.
Oh, no.
It's okay.
I'm just gonna stay in tonight.
Nope.
We're not taking no for an answer.
You never go out.
Tonight you're going out.
We're gonna take you to that new club...
Pajamas.
And no admittance without pajamas, so get dressed.
Well, actually, undressed.
Go on.
We're gonna wait for you.
Lauren?
Madison?
All right, all right.
I'll just be a minute.
And don't stop to call John or Ricky or anyone.
Let's go.
It's your night, Amy Juergens.
Hey, there you guys are.
Sorry.
Those ladies at the nursery love to chat.
Can I help you with something?
Got it all under control.
All right.
If you don't mind, I'm gonna get John ready for bed before dinner tonight 'cause I need to run over to my apartment and take care of some things later.
I'll just be gone about an hour, if that's okay.
You taking him with you?
I'm gonna ask Ashley if she'll keep an eye on him.
Okay.
Let me know how that goes.
Yeah.
I can't watch John tonight.
Hi, John.
Say hi to Aunt Ashley.
Hi, Aunt Ashley.
Why not?
I'll just be gone an hour.
I don't have an hour.
Ohhh.
It's a private conversation.
We'll just cover our ears.
I don't know why you're so upset.
I'm the one who should be upset.
You told everyone I was in New York.
You didn't have to do that.
It wasn't anyone's business if I was in New York.
Your sister and I needed to talk.
Do you really think you're in love with Amy?
I don't know.
All I know is I might wanna find that out before she's in love with someone else or I fall in love with someone else, because your sister and I have a baby together.
And you really think you're ready for a relationship?
A monogamous relationship?
You?
I might be.
I could be.
Yeah, you could be, but that would mean that you'd have to commit to being with Amy and only Amy for the rest of your life.
The rest of your life.
Let me say that again.
The rest of your life.
So?
So I doubt you're ready.
All right.
That's what I need the hour for.
I wanna go to therapy tonight.
So, will you watch John or not?
I'll watch him!
I hate being in a house where everyone can hear everything I'm saying.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
You're welcome.
Hi, honey.
I'm home.
So, how was it?
It was great.
It was really great.
I have so much stuff to tell you that Donovan and I came up with.
But how was your day?
Dull as dishwater, just like I like it.
I don't know, George.
I don't know if you're really gonna be satisfied staying at home watching Robie and cooking and cleaning.
Who's staying at home?
We went to the park with Moose after you left and went to the pet store and let Moose get some new toys.
Then we came home and cleaned up and had some lunch and took a nap.
Then we watched Oprah while we folded some laundry.
Now he's sleeping, and I'm making dinner.
Piece of cake.
How did you find the time to go to the park and watch Oprah?
I never had the time to go to the park and watch Oprah.
I don't know.
Is that bouillabaisse?
Oui.
I love you.
I love you.
Oh, knock it off before no one can enjoy the bouillabaisse.
Why don't we tell her?
What?
No, it's supposed to be a surprise.
Oh, I hate surprises.
Your dad and I are getting married again.
Like I said, I hate surprises.
Well, it's not that big of a surprise, is it?
It's not such a big surprise that you hate it, is it?
No.
It's more like I don't care.
No one cares.
You're as married/divorced as you were when you were married.
So if you wanna get married again, get married again.
Thank you.
I think we're going to as soon as Amy gets back.
Oh, something else to look forward to.
Let's call Amy and tell her.
Yeah, more fun.
You want to?
Let's do it.
Do we have to?
You know, every party has a pooper, and that's what we invited you for.
Party pooper, party pooper.
* 'Cause I'm ready *
* To break free *
* Comes to me *
* I've been waiting *
Dad, is that you?
Where are you?
I'm at a club.
You're at a club?
At a club?
Really?
Who's at a club?
Amy.
We just called to tell you some good news.
What's she doing at a club?
Dad, I can't hear you.
Talk louder.
What kind of club?
What kind of club?
It's a pajama club.
You have to wear pajamas to get in.
Pajama club.
You have to wear pajamas to get in.
Interesting.
Not really.
I'll be back.
Amy, your dad and I are getting married again.
Really?
Tonight?
No, not tonight.
What?
I can't hear you.
What?
Just hang up.
Okay, Amy, I'll talk to you later.
I love you.
Bye.
So, when Amy gets back?
When Amy gets back.
* Comes to me *
* I've been waiting *
There you go, Lady Liberty.
* For so long *
* Now I'm ready *
Need some help with that?
No, I don't.
But...thanks.
You're welcome.
I thought you were staying home tonight with John.
I thought that's why you couldn't come over.
Change of plans.
See you.
Wait.
Not so fast.
How was New York?
New York was New York.
I talked to Amy.
Amy didn't tell you anything about New York.
I know she didn't.
She didn't have to tell me anything.
I could read between the lines.
And, well, she sounded as if...
Never mind.
As if what?
I don't know.
It's just that...
Just that what?
I guess I can tell you.
I mean, we're friends, so why not?
Look, I think maybe you confuse Amy by going to see her.
How's that?
You know she loves Ben.
She's always loved Ben, and now she won't even speak to Ben.
She wasn't speaking to Ben anyway.
I think that has something to do with you, not me.
It could, but...
Look, I think someone at the program told Amy she should be with the father of her baby and that all girls should be with the father of their babies, even if they're in love with another guy.
Did Amy say that?
Not exactly, no.
But she's not...
She's not trying to get you to marry her or something like that, is she?
I mean, that's what they probably tell those girls at those programs... to get the baby's father to marry them.
I mean, that's what my own father is telling me... to get Ben to marry me.
But like I told you, I would never marry Ben because he loves Amy, and they belong together.
And what?
We belong together?
We don't belong together, Adrian.
I'd like to be friends if that's possible, but we don't belong together.
You're having Ben's baby, not my baby.
Ben's baby.
So maybe Ben and Amy weren't meant to be after all.
And maybe like your father said, you and Ben should get married.
I think you should get married.
How come you're moving the baby seat out of the car?
You going out?
I'm going to therapy.
No, I don't think so.
You don't move the baby seat out of the car to go to therapy.
You move the baby seat out of the car when you're planning on getting together with, well, whoever you can get together with.
I know you really well.
Good night.
Ricky, I know you, and I accept who you are, unlike Amy.
She is never gonna understand you the way I understand you.
Good.
I'm glad, all right?
I don't want her to accept me or understand me.
I want her to change me.
No one can change you, Ricky.
And no one can change you.
Good night.
Hey, you coming with us?
Oh, you're still here?
I thought you and Betty had left.
No, it's still early.
You coming?
No.
I think I'm gonna go over and see Grace tonight.
Grace?
Why is that?
I thought I might ask her opinion about a ring for Adrian.
A ring?
What kind of ring?
You know what kind of ring.
I don't think I do.
You can't be talking about an engagement ring while you're walking around here still crying 'cause Amy hasn't called you and told you all about last weekend with Ricky.
I could be.
You're gonna marry Adrian to get back at Amy for not calling you?
Did you not learn your lesson when you had sex with Adrian to get back at Amy?
Guess not.
Wait until Amy gets home.
Wait until you sit down and talk to her.
Clear the air, give it some time, and as things go along, see how you feel about Adrian, all right?
No, not "all right."
I'm just gonna marry Adrian and get it over with.
Not out of spite you're not.
Uh-uh.
I thought that you and Ruben wanted me and Adrian to get married.
We do.
But we want you and Adrian to want to get married.
If you don't wanna get married, it's not gonna be a good marriage for either one of you.
And you can't get married out of spite, you hear me?
I hear you.
But you know what?
I'm a big boy now, and I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do.
Yeah, unless, of course, I tell you you can't.
You can't get married.
When and if the time is right, I'll go along with it.
But I'm not gonna go along with it right now under these circumstances.
Then how's this?
I accept that Amy and I are not ever going to be together.
Maybe because I'm having a baby with Adrian, or maybe because she had a baby with Ricky, or maybe for no reason at all other than it was just never meant to be.
But I'm going to suck it up, I'm gonna be responsible, and I'm gonna marry the woman who's gonna be the mother of my child.
And unlike Ricky, I wanna do that before the baby gets here.
Unlike Ricky.
Unlike Ricky.
You don't wanna be like Ricky.
I don't wanna be like Ricky.
What's being or not being like Ricky have to do with anything?
Okay.
Fine.
Don't be like Ricky.
Go over to Adrian's house and tell her father that you wanna marry her, 'cause that's just what he wants to hear.
You wanna do it, do it.
I change my mind.
I'm not gonna stop you.
Go ahead.
You wanna get married, get married.
For whatever reason or no reason at all.
I will.
Go.
Maybe after I go over to Grace's.
Yeah.
Pick out the ring first.
That's the important thing...
picking out the ring.
That and trying to put it on the finger of your best friend's ex-girlfriend because he screwed up your life by getting your girlfriend pregnant before she was even your girlfriend.
Hey, Benjamin.
Uh, Leo, Bunny wants you to call her before we go out.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
She called here at the house?
Mm-hmm.
Yep.
She said she didn't wanna disturb you, and she said that she wanted to apologize for what she had to do.
Yep, that was the message... that she really wanted to talk to you about what she had to do.
What'd she have to do?
I don't know.
What'd she have to do?
I don't know.
Are you sure you don't know?
You were at the shop all day.
I guess she might be referring to the fact that she had to let me go.
Let you go where?
She fired you?
You got fired from the family business...
a business with our name on it?
For what?
Attacking Ricky.
He wouldn't tell me what happened with Amy last weekend.
For the love of Pete.
Is he dead...
Ricky?
Because, well, if he is dead, she's gonna need Ben more than ever.
I mean, not that I would want Ricky to be dead.
It's just that if... if...
Ricky isn't dead, is he?
I mean, is he hurt or something?
Unfortunately, no.
He lives and lives on in John.
So that's what's driving you to get married.
You got angry with Ricky and got yourself fired from the job, and now you wanna get married.
I don't know how much more of this I can take, Ben, without losing my temper.
Without really losing my temper.
And no one wants to see me really lose my temper!
Jeez, Ben.
I'm really hungry.
I mean, this probably means we're not gonna go to dinner now.
Probably.
I should've just told him.
I thought I had more time before he found out, and I'd use that time wisely to do something stupid.
Well, look, Ben, you can't just run around and go attacking some guy because he's... he's with a woman you can't have.
You know?
Yeah, I know.
And you can't run around and marry some girl just because she's the woman you can have.
Yes, I can, Betty.
Unfortunately, I can, and I'm going to.
Probably.
Hey, Dr. Fields, right?
Right.
Aren't you...
Leo Boykewich.
Right.
My daughter goes to school with your son.
Lauren.
She's Amy Juergen's best friend.
Oh, right.
Lauren.
Nice girl.
So, how's the shrink business?
A patient didn't show up.
I had my own problems I needed to deal with tonight, so I left my family and went back to the office, and then the patient doesn't show up.
So the shrink business stinks.
Thanks for asking.
Nights like this make me think
I should just quit while I'm ahead.
Not that I'm ahead, I mean.
Nights like this make me think I should get out of the meat business.
My son, Ben, got fired from his job at our butcher shop this afternoon.
I mean, he's obsessed with Amy, and...
You know, my daughter lied about where she was spending the night Friday night.
I found out, and now her mother has forbid her from seeing this guy.
I don't think she and this guy were doing anything.
I don't think they were doing anything.
It's just that she lied about where she was.
They weren't doing anything.
They weren't.
Why'd she lie?
They wanted to spend the night together.
To do what?
To do...nothing.
I mean, what teenage boy isn't gonna do it if he can do it?
I wish it weren't true, but...
Statistics say otherwise.
Only half of teenagers have sex in high school.
What, and the other half are girls?
Who are all these boys doing it with, huh?
They're not all doing it.
They're not.
That's how Ben got into trouble.
He had the chance, he took it, and now...
And now he's having a baby.
I'm scared to death that's what's gonna happen to Lauren, which is why I got upset about her lying.
But they weren't doing anything.
They weren't.
Ben and Adrian had sex to get back at Ricky and Amy.
Now he actually wants to marry Adrian to get back at Ricky and Amy.
I mean, the two of them, if they wanted to get married, that would be one thing.
But to get married out of spite.
Can you believe that?
Married?
My 16-year-old son is having a baby and he wants to get married, and it all comes from getting back at a ex-girlfriend and his best friend.
I mean, what kind of marriage is that?
What kind of life is that to be married to someone you don't wanna be married to?
How's your marriage going?
You got married recently, didn't you?
Yeah.
Yeah, I did.
And?
We're happy.
We're very happy.
Very happy.
Both of you?
Look, I only answer for myself, of course.
You're very happy.
You don't look very happy.
You know, maybe I'll call your office.
Mmm.
I'll tell you what my problem is.
I want my family back.
I want my wife back.
Yeah.
Yeah, me, too.
But in my case, that's not possible.
But in your case...
She remarried.
Oh.
She's not dead, is she?
No.
No, she isn't.
Come in.
Oh.
Hey, Ben.
Grace isn't home.
She and Grant went to pick up some things for med camp.
Or at least that's where she said she was going.
They're probably out somewhere making out.
Okay.
You can wait here if you want.
Can I?
Yeah.
Why not?
It's not your house?
Yeah, well, no one's home, so...
Mmm.
Madison's dad is making us break up.
I'm thinking about getting married.
Oh, well, if you're thinking about marrying Grace, you're out of luck, and so am I.
I think she's in love with this Grant guy.
No, I'm not thinking about marrying Grace.
I'm thinking about marrying Adrian.
I just feel compelled to marry her.
Because of the baby?
Yeah.
Sort of.
And because I think it's unfair that Amy's getting back together with Ricky.
I mean, I think she is.
I have a feeling she is.
Why couldn't I have just gotten her pregnant instead of Adrian?
Wasn't she already pregnant when you met her?
Yes.
Yes, she was, but I fell in love with her anyway.
What is this, a meeting of the lonely hearts club?
We need to get out there and get our women back.
How are you supposed to get Tammy back?
Forget it.
She's married, Tom.
Every relationship can be broken.
Not every relationship.
Not Ricky and Amy apparently.
Every relationship.
How'd I get myself into this?
I just wanted to have some fun.
Yeah, that's how most people get into it.
Where are your parents?
They're at a medical fund-raiser for some kids in Africa.
And you're okay with this?
I'm okay with this.
What is this?
We're just making out.
We've made out before.
Not with our shirts off.
Uh, I said with your shirt off.
Yeah, okay.
What about pants?
Pants off?
No.
Pants on.
All pants stay on.
Especially underpants, which I prefer to call knickers.
Knickers, huh?
How about knickers on but pants off?
Uh, I don't know how I feel about that.
You like to dance?
We could have a pants-off dance off.
Really?
That sounds fun.
Or we could just dance, because I have a feeling that if anything comes off, we'll get ourselves into a situation we can't get out of.
And what would that situation be?
That situation would be sex.
Yeah.
I don't wanna have sex.
I wanna have sex, but it may be a little early in the relationship to have sex.
Besides, we have the whole summer to have sex at med camp.
Do they even check to see if the car's in the driveway?
No.
They hear we're out for the evening, and they think we're out for the evening.
Did you hear that?
No, I didn't hear that.
What didn't I hear?
He said they have the whole summer to have sex at med camp.
Yeah, that's what he said...
that Grant.
Well, he's right, you know?
They do.
And that's part of what med camp's for, you know?
To get these young, would-be, could-be doctors into bed together and get them ready for medical school.
What?
I'm joking, Kathleen, all right?
I'm joking.
Look, teenagers don't need med camp as an excuse to have sex with each other.
No.
They just need a pants-off dance off.
A what?
Yeah, that's what he suggested... a pants-off dance off.
Interesting approach.
Points for creativity.
They're not gonna have sex, all right?
Not yet.
You don't know that.
Oh, I know that.
Hey, Grace, we're home!
Thank you.
So, do you dance?
Shut up.
We can't do it again.
I have to go.
You don't have to go.
I don't have to go.
No one has to go anywhere until we're ready to go.
You said you only have an hour.
It's been an hour and a half.
I know.
But it was really nice.
Really.
What happened in New York?
Someone promise someone he'd be faithful?
Yeah.
It makes me run in the other direction, too.
We didn't agree to be faithful.
I'm not breaking any promises here, and she's not breaking any promises there.
Even if she is out at a club?
Even if she is.
All we said was we'd think about it.
Well, I like the way you think.
Good night, all right?
I had a really nice time.
Really nice.
But I have to go.
Call me, or don't call me.
Good night.
Good night.
No text from Ricky?
No.
No text from Madison or Lauren?
No.
From your sister?
No.
Not even from your mom or dad?
No, but whatever.
I had a really nice time.
You should have a picture.
All right.
Nice.
What are you doing?
I'm sending it to Ricky.
Whatever.
Let's go.
We have class tomorrow.
It's late.
It's late.
We have class.
We shouldn't have any fun.
We're mommies.
Enjoy it.
The real world is coming back sooner than you think.
What are you doing here?
Your dad let me in.
Oh, did he?
Hmm.
Nice of him to ask me if I wanted company.
Sorry.
But, uh, I saw that your light was on, and I left my phone at home, and I was out driving around, thinking about things, and I just felt like seeing you.
So Amy still didn't call you, huh?
No.
She might if you had your phone.
No, I don't think so.
I'll just wait to talk to her when she gets back.
Mm-hmm.
So I guess you talked to Ricky?
I saw him out in front of the house.
Be careful.
The front of the house can be trouble.
Yeah, it can be.
But as far as Ricky goes,
I think that trouble is over.
I'm over him.
Are you?
Maybe.
Look, Ben, we've been acting like idiots because we're not ready to let go of Amy and Ricky.
And as ridiculous as that is, it's true.
Yeah.
Here's what I'm thinking.
And don't think that I don't care for you, because I do.
And I care for you, but let's face it, we're not in love with each other.
No.
So what would happen if we got engaged?
What would happen if Amy and Ricky thought that we were gonna be unavailable to them for the rest of our lives?
Okay, if you give me a ring,
I think my dad might insist you marry me.
I would know it was a fake engagement, and you would know it was a fake engagement, but if no one else knew it was a fake engagement and my father thought it was real,
I just don't know if you could get out of it, or if we could get out of it.
I'd be willing to take that chance.
Would you?
I think you should text them all.
No.
I don't care, really.
You do, too, care.
And you know what?
You should say that you care.
You should say how you feel.
You should let people know.
If you are upset about something, you need to let them know.
That's what we've been talking about in group.
Been talking about not trying to be perfect just because we totally screwed up.
I mean, we still have feelings, and some of those feelings towards people are not so great.
Your feeling towards your friends and family tonight, for example.
I mean, you could let them know in a nice way, but you should let them know.
Here.
Let me take another picture... a picture that you can send to everyone.
And put "Happy birthday to me" as the subject.
I don't know.
Do it.
Wait.
It's Ricky.
That's sweet, but why would he send me that?
I'll tell you why.
Because he thinks you're out at a club having fun while poor Ricky is home alone with John, which I doubt, by the way.
He probably just got home.
That sounds about right.
Happy birthday, Amy.
To są te buty.
Podniosą ci tyłek.
Masz dużo pięknych koleżanek, ale Josie jest zdecydowanie najlepsza.
Uwielbiam twoje zmarszczki, gdy się usmiechasz.
Kochanie, przecież jesteśmy na diecie.
Czy jakaś nastolatka zostawiła tu swojego iPoda?
Czy było dobrze?
Hm...
Ale byłaś piękna...
Hej, kochanie.
Hey, you're home.
Uh, yeah, my dinner got cancelled.
This is awesome.
I'm just a dude sitting at home doing nothing, sexy lady walks in?
Let's go out.
I want to show you off.
Paint the town with my beautiful baby.
What happened in there?
Honey, I wore that t-shirt to play tag football this weekend.
It's fine.
Um, do we have any more of that pizza from two nights ago?
It's in the trash.
Inside trash or outside trash?
12 days, the two of us in Italy.
Maserati's flying me out for being the number one dealership in the state.
Aren't you the only dealer in the state?
No one else even tries.
Honey, we should get going soon.
It's almost bed time.
It's, like, 2:00 in the afternoon.
Oh, well, we're getting on Italian time.
We don't want to miss out because of jet lag again.
Hey, guys, guess what.
Great news.
We're gonna buy a house.
- Hey.
- Really?
You guys are getting married in a few weeks.
Are you sure you want to take that on to?
This is not the kind of attitude
I want from...
My new real estate agent?
I'd do it myself, but conflict of interest, you know?
Surgeon can't operate on himself.
What's wrong with your arm?
We have bed bugs.
We do not have bed bugs.
We have an old copy of newsweek in the bathroom.
He reads a couple of articles.
Suddenly we're infested and he understands the genesis of the tea party movement.
There's a lot of anger out there.
That's a classic stress rash.
Big-purchase induced.
I see it all the time at the dealership.
Guy comes in, puts down 100k for a car, skin starts flaking, hair starts falling out.
And the men who buy my cars do not have hair to spare.
All right, Amy's on her way over to look at houses.
Um, let me talk to you about something here that's been kind of...
And I feel really shallow for even bringing this up.
No, I am right there with you.
I do not know what's going on with Isabella's hair.
There is a pattern emerging with Julia where she de-glams herself.
She's out all day dazzling clients, looking awesome, putting on a show for the world, but when she gets home, out comes the sweats and the makeup towel.
Like the world's getting the ten.
I'm kind of getting, like, a 6.5.
So troubling, man.
I mean, comfort's great, but we must require excellence from each other, or the spark goes out.
Amy wears an array of sexy bras and underwear sets.
I return the favor by rocking tighty-whities and Western footwear.
I didn't realize it was excellence you were going after, but...
Ciao.
What is that?
Italian greeting.
Total immersion.
You know what?
It's nice.
What's wrong with this guy?
Julia has given up.
David, in his total acceptance, has created a safe haven for her sloth.
How bad is it?
Has she stopped sleeping in her nighttime jewelry?
It's bad.
Sweat pants.
Makeup towel.
How's the bedroom?
Is she applying herself, Dave?
Does she create an environment of safe experimentation and support?
She's your sister.
So I shouldn't be rooting for her pleasure?
Can't wait to get to Europe.
So tired of your puritanical views of sex.
All right.
Um, I think I'm gonna talk to her about it.
You should.
Yeah, if it's important to you, get it out in the open.
But this is a tricky area.
You got to be delicate, you know?
You stay positive.
Use words like "love" and "opportunity."
And then there are words to avoid.
Lackluster.
Lazy.
- Defeated.
- Greasy.
- Mailing it in.
- Letting it slide.
Not what I signed up for.
What's up?
Hey.
There she is.
Why don't you give me a little preview of tonight's duo?
Bang.
Excellence.
Here it is.
Take a look around.
Let me know what you think.
That's it?
That's your big pitch?
Owned for the last 60 years by little Elizabeth Markoff.
This stunning craftsman, lovingly restored, will transport you to a simpler time.
Four kids and eighteen grandchildren have filled this house with laughter and taken advantage of the half bath added in 1983.
It's not a house.
It's a home.
Pass.
Pass?
I love it.
Doggie door.
Really?
You'd like to live knowing a tiny man or child could crawl into our house at any time?
You're impossible.
You'll fall in love with anything.
Yeah.
It's a problem.
Hey, gorgeous.
What a day.
Oh, these tights.
Itchy and so sweaty, and so...
I just...
Let me get 'em...
Ugh.
Gross.
Can we talk?
Rex, I can't sleep.
Will you tell me about some of the great things you did today?
It relaxes me.
It was a good day.
Made a witty comment to a male Starbucks barista.
Not everyone does that.
What does it cost me?
Made his day.
Oh, and I weighed in on Dave's relationship.
Thanks to me, he's having an open conversation with Julia.
She needs it.
I visited her at work today.
We were walking across campus...
Parents' weekend is so sweet.
Oh, I know.
What's yours majoring in?
What?
- Okay.
- Oh.
So what supportive thing did you encourage Dave to tell her?
'Scusi.
Abort, abort.
She got called old, Dave.
Mission compromised.
I repeat, mission compromised.
Aah.
So you'd like me to be hotter?
No, no, no, not hotter.
You... as hot as you are...
Longer.
So you're saying that I don't tart it up enough for you?
No, that's not what I'm saying.
Nor am I saying that you're defeated.
Or that you've let it slide.
That last house was perfect.
It was near a school.
You know the sound of children's laughter makes me melancholy.
Dave, obviously, as our agent, you are available 24-7.
We need you to arbitrate.
We will be in your home office awaiting appropriate client snacks.
Butter cookies, cheez-its.
Okay?
How about that Amy?
Did you catch a glimpse of that cute little bra she had on?
I suppose all women have access to those?
Mission compromised.
Return to base.
I hope you're checking your voice mail.
These stupid bed bugs.
There are no bed bugs.
It's a stress rash like Rex said.
You're afraid of buying a house.
And do you know why?
You're afraid of committing to a life with me.
Quoting Rex.
This is what you've been reduced to?
That's a good point.
This is an opportunity.
I'm not being pretty enough for you.
I am wasting all of my "getting pretty" time making money.
Ugly money.
Honey, I'm not saying...
You know what?
Maybe I should work less.
I think that's a really good idea.
Oh, shoot, but you know what?
If I work less, then how are we gonna handle that shortfall of cash?
You know what?
You could work a little harder.
We don't even need to...
No, no, no.
This is good.
This is great.
Because while I am at the bra store, asking myself, "is this gonna do it for my hubby,"
maybe you could just be selling more houses.
Yeah.
Instead of leaving work at 2:00 in the afternoon with vance because the two of you haven't quote "bowled" in a while.
I'm gonna say something that's gonna upset you.
We need to see a couple's therapist about this.
Okay.
Put me in a bind.
If I act upset, I seem predictable.
But if I assent to your wishes,
I appear to condone the dark arts of the social sciences.
I'm not going.
Oh, my God.
I take it back.
I don't even... your 6.5 is great, by the way.
A 6.5?
So you've given me a numerical rating.
Oh, neat.
So it's like a beauty pageant?
Is there... can I...
I was joking.
'Cause I... well, thought it would make you laugh.
It was a bad... you know, 'cause we're always making fun of people like that.
You know?
Like, what if I was that guy?
I just want to find a great house.
I'm not gonna settle.
I don't want to mail it in like Dave says Julia is.
Vance is in on the joke.
He's the one that, like...
It's probably more clever than funny.
You never answer your phone.
Last night I saw a Puerto Rico license plate.
Now this.
What's it gonna take, Dave?
Just drive, man.
You got to stand up a little.
Just try... no, put your feet on the ground.
- You're not...
- Almost there.
You shouldn't send friends to voice mail.
Well, you and Rex have been to couples therapy.
How did you get him to go?
First time can be tough.
Tell me about the nature of your relationship.
This isn't a strip club, is it?
You have to go see Dr. Dahlquist.
She is a miracle worker.
Hey, guys.
- Hey.
- You will not believe what Dave is trying to pull.
I come home exhausted from 12 hours of work and he has the nerve to take issue with the fact that I like to put on my casuals and get a little comfortable.
You do get comfortable.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Stay in a ball gown and full makeup all night long?
That makeup towel does get a workout.
Oh, come on, guys.
Where's my sex in the city bitch fest?
Honey, we would love to sit here and rhyme things with labia, but this is about your marriage.
And you could stand to try a little harder.
What about feminism?
What did our weird aunts die for?
Let's not get hung up on principles.
This is about maintaining a standard for the couple.
Look, men will always do the bare minimum unless we shame them into more.
- And it's not easy.
- No.
I wear high heels all the time to look sexy.
It's weakening my ankle bones.
Do you have clicky foot?
Stage five.
Oh, God, that's awful.
Yeah.
That's what it sounds like.
If I were a horse, they'd put me down.
Because I'm committed to my relationship,
I never go number two in our house.
I have a gym membership solely for that purpose.
So somewhere between her and me is probably where you're gonna want to settle in.
Dahlquist, huh?
I thought I knew all the other real estate agents in town.
She's supposed to be great.
And, you know, it's good we're giving Dave a break.
We're a lot to handle.
You know what I like about this place?
There's no maps, there's no listings, you know?
It's subtle, but the passion is clear.
This is a woman who was put on this earth to sell houses.
Yeah.
Welcome.
I'm Lindsay dahlquist.
Hi.
Vance.
What brings us together today?
Uh, well, we're looking for a house.
Mm.
Big move.
That can be very stressful.
She's got a soft voice.
She's commanding my attention.
Uh, so here's the deal.
I love mid-century modern... but before we talk about real estate issues, maybe we should talk about vance and why he has difficulty deciding things.
- What?
- Let's explore that.
I don't think this is really about looking for a home.
I think this is about the two of you and...
Connection.
How's your sex life?
Robust.
Tempestuous.
And we don't believe in taboos.
I appreciate your openness.
Yeah, I'm digging you too.
I can work with her.
- Interested in some post-work comfort?
Sweat pants, makeup towel.
We didn't talk all day.
You left so early.
And there's a little bit of a radio silence on my apology emails?
Although maybe I got the address wrong.
Is it still gorgeous love of my life at most special wife dot com?
Honey, I am so, so sorry.
I... it came out the wrong... everything about it was stupid.
I'm a shallow bastar...
Here's your ten.
Oh, my...
Now earn it.
What?
I'll be waiting downstairs.
Make yourself pretty, and show me the night of my life.
Bang.
I was this height when I was in fifth grade, and the doctors told me that I would be seven foot one, and I think...
Well, I think that's...
I think that's why I'm so adamant about the house having...
having high ceilings.
I can't help but notice you've made several very specific real estate digressions.
Well, that's vance, you know?
It's his job.
It's his identity.
It probably has to do with his parents' divorce.
Maybe we want to explore that?
Well, you know, my dad left when I was eight, and I think that's why I throw like a girl.
And... you know what?
I think you should show us some houses.
I'm sorry.
You want me to show you houses?
I mean, you're a real estate agent.
I'm a therapist.
Slash real estate agent.
I was led to believe.
No?
That's a... what?
Amy, what the hell?
You're sick.
You have a crippling fear of commitment, and you need help.
You doubted me and you've deceived me.
That's the double d.
See?
Here's his obsession with big breasts.
Stop revealing things to her.
And you.
I opened up to you 'cause I thought you were a licensed real estate agent.
She really said that?
Yeah.
And she wants the night of her life.
And it has to be with you?
Yeah, it has to be with me.
What are you...?
I got your call.
Sorry.
I was busy being the victim of Amy's emotional terrorism.
Uh, Julia wants a night?
She turned the tables on him.
Oh, she's good.
We should have seen this coming.
What are you wearing?
What do you think of this tie?
It's awful.
It's nothing.
That tie is a non-swing.
Vance, I'm so glad you're here.
It's been like this the whole time.
What about bowtie?
No.
It promises an intelligence you won't be delivering.
And picture it around that huge neck.
It'll be like you're giving her a stump as a present.
All right.
No, we're finally talking about the neck.
Do lovers carve their initials in it?
Do vermonters tap it for syrup?
Okay, you're done.
Where are you gonna take her?
- Julia's, you know, she likes authentic, simple low-key.
Don't be cheap, man.
Cafe Pierre.
Dave, that was uncool.
Don't shut me down like that.
I'm staying with him.
Amy issues.
I didn't want to burden you.
Rex is not a great listener, but the gelato here is sick, right?
Take her to cafe Pierre, get the tasting menu with the wine pairings, give the waiter a $50, and get a nice table.
I don't know.
Now it feels like we're making a big production out of it.
Are we putting too much pressure on this?
No, Dave.
Stakes couldn't be higher.
Will you be able to reclaim your magic, or have you slid too far and lost it forever?
Ciao!
So do you have room for dessert?
Put that away, sweetie.
It's all taken care of.
Happy Birthday, madame.
Thank you.
I love when we pretend it's my birthday.
To my perfect ten.
Oh, that means a lot coming from a perfect ten.
Thank you.
You know what, baby?
We are great at this.
Yeah.
There's no reason why we can't just do this all the time.
This is the new us.
I like it.

Oh, my God.
I just want to go to bed, man.
We ask one thing of our guests.
Stay nine hours ahead of Pacific Standard Time.
- And we have a very strict Rex-only nude policy.
Don't let the old lady rattle you.
There's some wiggle room.
- Vance.
- Amy?
I'm so sorry I doubted you.
The bed bugs are real.
I'm covered in them.
- I told you, I'm not a commitment-phobe.
I'm just a picky jerk.
Dahlquist, you've done it again, you magnificent bitch.
Cognac?
Oh, don't mind if I do.
Another magical evening.
- I hate this.
- I hate it more.
I'm so tired.
I have so many hooks digging into me to make this look work.
So do I. It is really hard being a ten.
I'll race you to a four?
Wait, wait, wait, though.
Are we sure we want to do this?
Because we did kind of fall into a rut before.
But now we know we can be tens whenever we want.
So let's do it.
Like, once a month.
The tenth of every month.
We'll call it the tens on the tens.
In the meantime...
You get your makeup towel.
And release that neck from your collared prison.
Oh, and let's get pizza!
Hey guys!
Sorry to ** at seven in the morning.
- *** - ***
I don't really know what this is, but I don't want to say no to a morning wine.
Well, we have a little box situation all out the sudden.
Yeah, apparently they jumped off your clothes and into our house.
You guys mind if we crash here?
You're family, where else are you gonna go?
Sit, sit.
Manja, manja.
- ***?
- ***.
- THEY'RE THOSE SHOES.
THEY TONE YOUR BUTT.
- YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF HOT FRIENDS,
BUT JOSIE IS DEFINITELY THE HOTTEST.
[laughter]
- I LOVE YOUR LAUGH LINES.
- OH, HONEY, DID YOU NOT SEE THAT WE HAVE DIET?
- DID A TEENAGE GIRL LEAVE HER iPOD HERE?
- WAS IT GOOD?
UM...
- GOD YOU WERE PRETTY.

# THE SECRET TO THE LIFE YOU WANTED #
# IT IS ALL TRUE #
# SOMEONE'S GOT TO DO IT #
# NOW WE HAVE THE BACKSEAT WORKING #
# WE'VE GOT PROOF #
# ALL WE NEED IS YOU #
- HI, HONEY.
- HEY, YOU'RE HOME.
- UH, YEAH, MY DINNER GOT CANCELLED.
- THIS IS AWESOME.
I'M JUST A DUDE SITTING AT HOME DOING NOTHING,
SEXY LADY WALKS IN?
LET'S GO OUT.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU OFF.
PAINT THE TOWN WITH MY BEAUTIFUL BABY.
WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE?
HONEY, I WORE THAT T-SHIRT
TO PLAY TAG FOOTBALL THIS WEEKEND.
- IT IS FINE.
UM, DO WE HAVE ANY MORE OF THAT PIZZA FROM TWO NIGHTS AGO?
- IT IS IN THE TRASH.
- INSIDE TRASH OR OUTSIDE TRASH?
- 12 DAYS, THE TWO OF US IN ITALY.
MASERATI'S FLYING ME OUT
FOR BEING THE NUMBER ONE DEALERSHIP IN THE STATE.
- AREN'T YOU THE ONLY DEALER IN THE STATE?
- NO ONE ELSE EVEN TRIES.
HONEY, WE SHOULD GET GOING SOON.
IT IS ALMOST BED TIME.
- IT IS, LIKE, 2:00 IN THE AFTERNOON.
- OH, WELL, WE'RE GETTING ON ITALIAN TIME.
WE DON'T WANT TO MISS OUT BECAUSE OF JET LAG AGAIN.
[music playing, plates shattering]
- HEY, GUYS, GUESS WHAT.
GREAT NEWS.
WE'RE GONNA BUY A HOUSE.
- HEY.
- REALLY?
YOU GUYS ARE GETTING MARRIED IN A FEW WEEKS.
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT ON TO?
- THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF ATTITUDE
I WANT FROM...
MY NEW REAL ESTATE AGENT?
- OOH.
- I'D DO IT MYSELF,
BUT CONFLICT OF INTEREST, YOU KNOW?
SURGEON CAN'T OPERATE ON HIMSELF.
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR ARM?
- WE HAVE BED BUGS.
- WE DO NOT HAVE BED BUGS.
WE HAVE AN OLD COPY OFNEWSWEEKIN THE BATHROOM.
HE READS A COUPLE OF ARTICLES.
SUDDENLY WE'RE INFESTED AND HE UNDERSTANDS
THE GENESIS OF THE TEA PARTY MOVEMENT.
- THERE IS A LOT OF ANGER OUT THERE.
- THAT IS A CLASSIC STRESS RASH.
BIG-PURCHASE INDUCED.
I SEE IT ALL THE TIME AT THE DEALERSHIP.
GUY COMES IN, PUTS DOWN 100k FOR A CAR,
SKIN STARTS FLAKING, HAIR STARTS FALLING OUT.
AND THE MEN WHO BUY MY CARS DO NOT HAVE HAIR TO SPARE.
- ALL RIGHT, AMY'S ON HER WAY OVER TO LOOK AT HOUSES.
- UM, LET ME TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING HERE
THAT'S BEEN KIND OF...
AND I FEEL REALLY SHALLOW FOR EVEN BRINGING THIS UP.
- NO, I AM RIGHT THERE WITH YOU.
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON WITH ISABELLA IS HAIR.
- THERE IS A PATTERN EMERGING WITH JULIA
WHERE SHE DE-GLAMS HERSELF.
SHE IS OUT ALL DAY DAZZLING CLIENTS,
LOOKING AWESOME, PUTTING ON A SHOW FOR THE WORLD,
BUT WHEN SHE GETS HOME,
OUT COMES THE SWEATS AND THE MAKEUP TOWEL.
LIKE THE WORLD IS GETTING THE TEN.
I'M KIND OF GETTING, LIKE, A 6.5.
- SO TROUBLING, MAN.
I MEAN, COMFORT IS GREAT,
BUT WE MUST REQUIRE EXCELLENCE FROM EACH OTHER,
OR THE SPARK GOES OUT.
AMY WEARS AN ARRAY OF SEXY BRAS AND UNDERWEAR SETS.
I RETURN THE FAVOR BY ROCKING TIGHTY-WHITIES
AND WESTERN FOOTWEAR.
- I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS EXCELLENCE YOU WERE GOING AFTER,
BUT...
[door closes]
-CIAO.
- WHAT IS THAT?
- ITALIAN GREETING.
TOTAL IMMERSION.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT IS NICE.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS GUY?
- JULIA HAS GIVEN UP.
DAVID, IN HIS TOTAL ACCEPTANCE,
HAS CREATED A SAFE HAVEN FOR HER SLOTH.
- HOW BAD IS IT?
HAS SHE STOPPED SLEEPING IN HER NIGHTTIME JEWELRY?
- IT IS BAD.
SWEAT PANTS.
MAKEUP TOWEL.
- [speaks Italian]
HOW IS THE BEDROOM?
IS SHE APPLYING HERSELF, DAVE?
DOES SHE CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT
OF SAFE EXPERIMENTATION AND SUPPORT?
- SHE IS YOUR SISTER.
- SO I SHOULDN'T BE ROOTING FOR HER PLEASURE?
CAN'T WAIT TO GET TO EUROPE.
SO TIRED OF YOUR PURITANICAL VIEWS OF SEX.
- ALL RIGHT.
UM, I THINK I'M GONNA TALK TO HER ABOUT IT.
- YOU SHOULD.
- YEAH, IF IT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU,
GET IT OUT IN THE OPEN.
BUT THIS IS A TRICKY AREA.
- YOU GOT TO BE DELICATE, YOU KNOW?
YOU STAY POSITIVE.
USE WORDS LIKE "LOVE" AND "OPPORTUNITY."
- AND THEN THERE ARE WORDS TO AVOID.
LACKLUSTER.
- LAZY.
- DEFEATED.
- GREASY.
- MAILING IT IN.
- LETTING IT SLIDE.
- NOT WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR.
[door opens]
- WHAT'S UP?
- HEY.
- [whistles]
THERE SHE IS.
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE PREVIEW
OF TONIGHT'S DUO?
- BANG.
- EXCELLENCE.
- HERE IT IS.
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.
LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.
- THAT'S IT?
THAT'S YOUR BIG PITCH?
- OWNED FOR THE LAST 60 YEARS
BY LITTLE ELIZABETH MARKOFF.
THIS STUNNING CRAFTSMAN, LOVINGLY RESTORED,
WILL TRANSPORT YOU TO A SIMPLER TIME.
FOUR KIDS AND EIGHTEEN GRANDCHILDREN
HAVE FILLED THIS HOUSE WITH LAUGHTER
AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE HALF BATH ADDED IN 1983.
IT IS NOT A HOUSE.
IT IS A HOME.
- PASS.
- PASS?
I LOVE IT.
- DOGGIE DOOR.
REALLY?
YOU'D LIKE TO LIVE KNOWING A TINY MAN OR CHILD
COULD CRAWL INTO OUR HOUSE AT ANY TIME?
- YOU'RE IMPOSSIBLE.
- YOU'LL FALL IN LOVE WITH ANYTHING.
- YEAH.
IT IS A PROBLEM.
- HEY, GORGEOUS.
- WHAT A DAY.
[sighs]
OH, THESE TIGHTS.
UGH.
ITCHY AND SO SWEATY, AND SO--I JUST...
LET ME GET 'EM...
UGH.
GROSS.
- CAN WE TALK?
- REX, I CAN'T SLEEP.
WILL YOU TELL ME ABOUT SOME OF THE GREAT THINGS YOU DID TODAY?
IT RELAXES ME.
- IT WAS A GOOD DAY.
MADE A WITTY COMMENT TO A MALE STARBUCKS BARISTA.
NOT EVERYONE DOES THAT.
WHAT DOES IT COST ME?
MADE HIS DAY.
OH, AND I WEIGHED IN ON DAVE'S RELATIONSHIP.
THANKS TO ME, HE IS HAVING AN OPEN CONVERSATION WITH JULIA.
- SHE NEEDS IT.
I VISITED HER AT WORK TODAY.
WE WERE WALKING ACROSS CAMPUS...
- PARENTS' WEEKEND IS SO SWEET.
- OH, I KNOW.
WHAT'S YOURS MAJORING IN?
- WHAT?
- OKAY.
- OH.
- SO WHAT SUPPORTIVE THING
DID YOU ENCOURAGE DAVE TO TELL HER?
-'SCUSI.
ABORT, ABORT.
SHE GOT CALLED OLD, DAVE.
MISSION COMPROMISED.
I REPEAT, MISSION COMPROMISED.
AAH.
- SO YOU'D LIKE ME TO BE HOTTER?
- NO, NO, NO, NOT HOTTER.
YOU--AS HOT AS YOU ARE...
LONGER.
- SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT I DON'T TART IT UP ENOUGH FOR YOU?
- NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.
NOR AM I SAYING THAT YOU'RE DEFEATED.
OR THAT YOU'VE LET IT SLIDE.
- THAT LAST HOUSE WAS PERFECT.
- IT WAS NEAR A SCHOOL.
YOU KNOW THE SOUND OF CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER MAKES ME MELANCHOLY.
- DAVE, OBVIOUSLY, AS OUR AGENT,
YOU ARE AVAILABLE 24-7.
WE NEED YOU TO ARBITRATE.
- WE WILL BE IN YOUR HOME OFFICE
AWAITING APPROPRIATE CLIENT SNACKS.
BUTTER COOKIES, CHEEZ-ITS.
OKAY?
- HOW ABOUT THAT AMY?
DID YOU CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THAT CUTE LITTLE BRA SHE HAD ON?
I SUPPOSE ALL WOMEN HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE?
- MISSION COMPROMISED.
RETURN TO BASE.
I HOPE YOU'RE CHECKING YOUR VOICE MAIL.
[honks horn]
- THESE STUPID BED BUGS.
- THERE ARE NO BED BUGS.
IT IS A STRESS RASH LIKE REX SAID.
YOU'RE AFRAID OF BUYING A HOUSE.
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?
YOU'RE AFRAID OF COMMITTING TO A LIFE WITH ME.
- QUOTING REX.
THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN REDUCED TO?
- THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY.
I'M NOT BEING PRETTY ENOUGH FOR YOU.
MM-MM.
I AM WASTING ALL OF MY "GETTING PRETTY" TIME MAKING MONEY.
UGLY MONEY.
- HONEY, I'M NOT SAYING...
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE I SHOULD WORK LESS.
I THINK THAT IS A REALLY GOOD IDEA.
OH, SHOOT, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF I WORK LESS, THEN HOW ARE WE GONNA HANDLE
THAT SHORTFALL OF CASH?
HMM, HMM, HMM, HMM, HMM.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU COULD WORK A LITTLE HARDER.
- WE DON'T EVEN NEED TO...
- NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS GOOD.
THIS IS GREAT.
BECAUSE WHILE I AM AT THE BRA STORE,
ASKING MYSELF, "IS THIS GONNA DO IT FOR MY HUBBY,"
MAYBE YOU COULD JUST BE SELLING MORE HOUSES.
YEAH.
INSTEAD OF LEAVING WORK AT 2:00 IN THE AFTERNOON
WITH VANCE BECAUSE THE TWO OF YOU
HAVEN'T QUOTE "BOWLED" IN A WHILE.
- I'M GONNA SAY SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA UPSET YOU.
WE NEED TO SEE A COUPLE'S THERAPIST ABOUT THIS.
- OKAY.
PUT ME IN A BIND.
IF I ACT UPSET, I SEEM PREDICTABLE.
BUT IF I ASSENT TO YOUR WISHES,
I APPEAR TO CONDONE THE DARK ARTS OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES.
I'M NOT GOING.
- OH, MY GOD.
- I TAKE IT BACK.
I DON'T EVEN--
YOUR 6.5 IS GREAT, BY THE WAY.
- A 6.5?
SO YOU'VE GIVEN ME A NUMERICAL RATING.
OH, NEAT.
SO IT IS LIKE A BEAUTY PAGEANT?
- IS THERE--CAN I-- [laughs] I WAS JOKING.
'CAUSE I--WELL, THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE YOU LAUGH.
IT WAS A BAD--
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE WE'RE ALWAYS MAKING FUN OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT.
YOU KNOW?
LIKE, WHAT IF I WAS THAT GUY?
- I JUST WANT TO FIND A GREAT HOUSE.
I'M NOT GONNA SETTLE.
I DON'T WANT TO MAIL IT IN LIKE DAVE SAYS JULIA IS.
- VANCE IS IN ON THE JOKE.
HE IS THE ONE THAT, LIKE...
IT IS PROBABLY MORE CLEVER THAN FUNNY.
[door slams]
- YOU NEVER ANSWER YOUR PHONE.
LAST NIGHT I SAW A PUERTO RICO LICENSE PLATE.
NOW THIS.
WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE, DAVE?
- JUST DRIVE, MAN.
- YOU GOT TO STAND UP A LITTLE.
- JUST TRY--
- NO, PUT YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND.
- YOU'RE NOT--
- ALMOST THERE.
YOU SHOULDN'T SEND FRIENDS TO VOICE MAIL.
- WELL, YOU AND REX HAVE BEEN TO COUPLES THERAPY.
HOW DID YOU GET HIM TO GO?
- FIRST TIME CAN BE TOUGH.
- TELL ME ABOUT THE NATURE OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP.
- THIS ISN'T A STRIP CLUB, IS IT?
- YOU HAVE TO GO SEE DR. DAHLQUIST.
SHE IS A MIRACLE WORKER.
- HEY, GUYS.
- HEY.
- YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE
WHAT DAVE IS TRYING TO PULL.
I COME HOME EXHAUSTED FROM 12 HOURS OF WORK
AND HE HAS THE NERVE TO TAKE ISSUE
WITH THE FACT THAT I LIKE TO PUT ON MY CASUALS
AND GET A LITTLE COMFORTABLE.
- YOU DO GET COMFORTABLE.
- WELL, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
STAY IN A BALL GOWN AND FULL MAKEUP ALL NIGHT LONG?
- THAT MAKEUP TOWEL DOES GET A WORKOUT.
- OH, COME ON, GUYS.
WHERE IS MYSEX IN THE CITY BITCH FEST?
- HONEY, WE WOULD LOVE TO SIT HERE
AND RHYME THINGS WITH LABIA,
BUT THIS IS ABOUT YOUR MARRIAGE.
AND YOU COULD STAND TO TRY A LITTLE HARDER.
- WHAT ABOUT FEMINISM?
WHAT DID OUR WEIRD AUNTS DIE FOR?
- LET'S NOT GET HUNG UP ON PRINCIPLES.
THIS IS ABOUT MAINTAINING A STANDARD FOR THE COUPLE.
LOOK, MEN WILL ALWAYS DO THE BARE MINIMUM
UNLESS WE SHAME THEM INTO MORE.
- AND IT IS NOT EASY.
- NO.
- I WEAR HIGH HEELS ALL THE TIME TO LOOK SEXY.
IT IS WEAKENING MY ANKLE BONES.
- DO YOU HAVE CLICKY FOOT?
- STAGE FIVE.
[bones crunching]
- OH, GOD, THAT IS AWFUL.
- YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.
- IF I WERE A HORSE, THEY'D PUT ME DOWN.
- BECAUSE I'M COMMITTED TO MY RELATIONSHIP,
I NEVER GO NUMBER TWO IN OUR HOUSE.
I HAVE A GYM MEMBERSHIP SOLELY FOR THAT PURPOSE.
- SO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HER AND ME
IS PROBABLY WHERE YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO SETTLE IN.
- DAHLQUIST, HUH?
I THOUGHT I KNEW ALL THE OTHER REAL ESTATE AGENTS IN TOWN.
- SHE IS SUPPOSED TO BE GREAT.
AND, YOU KNOW, IT IS GOOD WE'RE GIVING DAVE A BREAK.
- WE'RE A LOT TO HANDLE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS PLACE?
THERE IS NO MAPS, THERE IS NO LISTINGS, YOU KNOW?
IT IS SUBTLE, BUT THE PASSION IS CLEAR.
THIS IS A WOMAN WHO WAS PUT ON THIS EARTH TO SELL HOUSES.
- YEAH.
- WELCOME.
I'M LINDSAY DAHLQUIST.
- HI.
VANCE.
- WHAT BRINGS US TOGETHER TODAY?
- UH, WELL, WE'RE LOOKING FOR A HOUSE.
- MM. BIG MOVE.
THAT CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL.
- SHE'S GOT A SOFT VOICE.
SHE IS COMMANDING MY ATTENTION.
UH, SO HERE IS THE DEAL.
I LOVE MID-CENTURY MODERN--
- BUT BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT REAL ESTATE ISSUES,
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT VANCE
AND WHY HE HAS DIFFICULTY DECIDING THINGS.
- WHAT?
- LET'S EXPLORE THAT.
I DON'T THINK THIS IS REALLY ABOUT LOOKING FOR A HOME.
I THINK THIS IS ABOUT THE TWO OF YOU AND...
CONNECTION.
HOW IS YOUR SEX LIFE?
- ROBUST.
TEMPESTUOUS.
AND WE DON'T BELIEVE IN TABOOS.
- OH.
[laughs]
I APPRECIATE YOUR OPENNESS.
- YEAH, I'M DIGGING YOU TOO.
I CAN WORK WITH HER.
- INTERESTED IN SOME POST-WORK COMFORT?
SWEAT PANTS, MAKEUP TOWEL.
WE DIDN'T TALK ALL DAY.
YOU LEFT SO EARLY.
AND THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A RADIO SILENCE
ON MY APOLOGY EMAILS?
ALTHOUGH MAYBE I GOT THE ADDRESS WRONG.
IS IT STILL GORGEOUS LOVE OF MY LIFE
AT MOST SPECIAL WIFE DOT COM?
HONEY, I AM SO, SO SORRY.
I--IT CAME OUT THE WRONG--
EVERYTHING ABOUT IT WAS STUPID.
I'M A SHALLOW BASTAR...
- HERE IS YOUR TEN.
- OH, MY...
- NOW EARN IT.
- WHAT?
- I'LL BE WAITING DOWNSTAIRS.
MAKE YOURSELF PRETTY, AND SHOW ME THE NIGHT OF MY LIFE.
BANG.
- I WAS THIS HEIGHT WHEN I WAS IN FIFTH GRADE,
AND THE DOCTORS TOLD ME
THAT I WOULD BE SEVEN FOOT ONE,
AND I THINK...
WELL, I THINK THAT'S--
I THINK THAT'S WHY I'M SO ADAMANT
ABOUT THE HOUSE HAVING-- HAVING HIGH CEILINGS.
- I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE YOU'VE MADE SEVERAL
VERY SPECIFIC REAL ESTATE DIGRESSIONS.
- WELL, THAT'S VANCE, YOU KNOW?
IT IS HIS JOB.
IT IS HIS IDENTITY.
IT PROBABLY HAS TO DO WITH HIS PARENTS' DIVORCE.
MAYBE WE WANT TO EXPLORE THAT?
- WELL, YOU KNOW, MY DAD LEFT WHEN I WAS EIGHT,
AND I THINK THAT IS WHY I THROW LIKE A GIRL.
AND--YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK YOU SHOULD SHOW US SOME HOUSES.
- I'M SORRY.
YOU WANT ME TO SHOW YOU HOUSES?
- I MEAN, YOU'RE A REAL ESTATE AGENT.
- I'M A THERAPIST.
- SLASH REAL ESTATE AGENT.
I WAS LED TO BELIEVE.
NO?
THAT'S A--WHAT?
- AMY, WHAT THE HELL?
- YOU'RE SICK.
YOU HAVE A CRIPPLING FEAR OF COMMITMENT,
AND YOU NEED HELP.
- YOU DOUBTED ME AND YOU'VE DECEIVED ME.
THAT'S THE DOUBLE D.
- SEE?
HERE'S HIS OBSESSION WITH BIG BREASTS.
- STOP REVEALING THINGS TO HER.
AND YOU.
I OPENED UP TO YOU
'CAUSE I THOUGHT YOU WERE A LICENSED REAL ESTATE AGENT.
- SHE REALLY SAID THAT?
- YEAH.
AND SHE WANTS THE NIGHT OF HER LIFE.
- AND IT HAS TO BE WITH YOU?
- YEAH, IT HAS TO BE WITH ME.
WHAT ARE YOU--?
- I GOT YOUR CALL.
SORRY.
I WAS BUSY BEING THE VICTIM
OF AMY'S EMOTIONAL TERRORISM.
UH, JULIA WANTS A NIGHT?
- SHE TURNED THE TABLES ON HIM.
- OH, SHE'S GOOD.
WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING.
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?
- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS TIE?
- IT'S AWFUL.
IT'S NOTHING.
THAT TIE IS A NON-SWING.
- VANCE, I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
IT'S BEEN LIKE THIS THE WHOLE TIME.
- WHAT ABOUT BOWTIE?
- NO.
IT PROMISES AN INTELLIGENCE
YOU WON'T BE DELIVERING.
- AND PICTURE IT AROUND THAT HUGE NECK.
IT'LL BE LIKE YOU'RE GIVING HER A STUMP AS A PRESENT.
- ALL RIGHT.
- NO, WE'RE FINALLY TALKING ABOUT THE NECK.
DO LOVERS CARVE THEIR INITIALS IN IT?
DO VERMONTERS TAP IT FOR SYRUP?
- OKAY, YOU'RE DONE.
- WHERE ARE YOU GONNA TAKE HER?
- JULIA'S, YOU KNOW, SHE LIKES AUTHENTIC, SIMPLE LOW-KEY.
- DON'T BE CHEAP, MAN.
- CAFE PIERRE.
DAVE, THAT WAS UNCOOL.
DON'T SHUT ME DOWN LIKE THAT.
- I'M STAYING WITH HIM.
AMY ISSUES.
I DIDN'T WANT TO BURDEN YOU.
REX IS NOT A GREAT LISTENER,
BUT THE GELATO HERE IS SICK, RIGHT?
- TAKE HER TO CAFE PIERRE,
GET THE TASTING MENU WITH THE WINE PAIRINGS,
GIVE THE WAITER A $50, AND GET A NICE TABLE.
- I DON'T KNOW.
NOW IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE MAKING A BIG PRODUCTION OUT OF IT.
ARE WE PUTTING TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON THIS?
- NO, DAVE.
STAKES COULDN'T BE HIGHER.
WILL YOU BE ABLE TO RECLAIM YOUR MAGIC,
OR HAVE YOU SLID TOO FAR AND LOST IT FOREVER?
CIAO!
- SO DO YOU HAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT?
- MM-HMM.
PUT THAT AWAY, SWEETIE.
IT'S ALL TAKEN CARE OF.
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MADAME.
- THANK YOU.
I LOVE WHEN WE PRETEND IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.
- TO MY PERFECT TEN.
- OH, THAT MEANS A LOT
COMING FROM A PERFECT TEN.
- THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW WHAT, BABY?
WE ARE GREAT AT THIS.
- YEAH.
THERE'S NO REASON
WHY WE CAN'T JUST DO THIS ALL THE TIME.
- THIS IS THE NEW US.
- I LIKE IT.
- # "L" #
# IS FOR THE WAY YOU LOOK AT ME #

- OH, MY GOD.
- I JUST WANT TO GO TO BED, MAN.
- WE ASK ONE THING OF OUR GUESTS.
STAY NINE HOURS AHEAD OF PACIFIC STANDARD TIME.
- AND WE HAVE A VERY STRICT REX-ONLY NUDE POLICY.
- DON'T LET THE OLD LADY RATTLE YOU.
THERE'S SOME WIGGLE ROOM.
- VANCE.
- AMY?
- I'M SO SORRY I DOUBTED YOU.
THE BED BUGS ARE REAL.
I'M COVERED IN THEM.
- I TOLD YOU, I'M NOT A COMMITMENT-PHOBE.
I'M JUST A PICKY JERK.
- [sighs]
- DAHLQUIST, YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN,
YOU MAGNIFICENT BITCH.
- COGNAC?
- OH, DON'T MIND IF I DO.
- ANOTHER MAGICAL EVENING.
- I HATE THIS.
- I HATE IT MORE.
I'M SO TIRED.
- I HAVE SO MANY HOOKS DIGGING INTO ME
TO MAKE THIS LOOK WORK.
- SO DO I. IT IS REALLY HARD BEING A TEN.
- I'LL RACE YOU TO A FOUR?
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, THOUGH.
ARE WE SURE WE WANT TO DO THIS?
BECAUSE WE DID KIND OF FALL INTO A RUT BEFORE.
- BUT NOW WE KNOW WE CAN BE TENS WHENEVER WE WANT.
SO LET'S DO IT.
LIKE, ONCE A MONTH.
- THE TENTH OF EVERY MONTH.
WE'LL CALL IT THE TENS ON THE TENS.
- IN THE MEANTIME...
- YOU GET YOUR MAKEUP TOWEL.
- AND RELEASE THAT NECK FROM YOUR COLLARED PRISON.
OH, AND LET'S GET PIZZA!
- HEY, GUYS.
SORRY TO BARGE IN AT 7:00 IN THE MORNING.
- MAMA, TWO MORE FOR DINNER.
- OH...
MORE MANICOTTI.
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THIS IS,
BUT I'M NOT ONE TO SAY NO TO MORNING WINE.
- WELL, WE HAVE A LITTLE
BUG SITUATION ALL OF A SUDDEN.
- YEAH, APPARENTLY THEY JUMPED OFF OF YOUR CLOTHES
AND INTO OUR HOUSE.
YOU GUYS MIND IF WE CRASH HERE?
- YOU'RE FAMILY.
WHERE ELSE YOU GONNA GO?
SIT, SIT.
MANGA, MANGA.
- YOU HAVE ANY CEREAL OR ANYTHING?
- JUST GO WITH IT.
NOBODY LIKES THE UGLY AMERICAN.

They're those shoes.
They tone your butt.
You've got a lot of hot friends, but Josie's definitely the hottest.
I love your laugh lines.
Oh, honey, did you not see that we have diet?
Did a teenage girl leave her iPod here?
Was it good?

Hi, honey.
Hey, you're home.
Uh, yeah, my dinner got cancelled.
This is awesome.
I'm just a dude sitting at home doing nothing, sexy lady walks in?
Let's go out.
I want to show you off.
Paint the town with my beautiful baby.
What happened in there?
Honey, I wore that t-shirt to play tag football this weekend.
It's fine.
Um, do we have any more of that pizza from two nights ago?
It's in the trash.
Inside trash or outside trash?
12 days, the two of us in Italy.
Maserati's flying me out for being the number one dealership in the state.
Aren't you the only dealer in the state?
No one else even tries.
Honey, we should get going soon.
It's almost bed time.
It's, like, 2:00 in the afternoon.
Oh, well, we're getting on Italian time.
We don't want to miss out because of jet lag again.
Hey, guys, guess what.
Great news.
We're gonna buy a house.
- Hey.
- Really?
You guys are getting married in a few weeks.
Are you sure you want to take that on to?
This is not the kind of attitude
I want from...
My new real estate agent?
I'd do it myself, but conflict of interest, you know?
Surgeon can't operate on himself.
What's wrong with your arm?
We have bed bugs.
We do not have bed bugs.
We have an old copy of newsweek in the bathroom.
He reads a couple of articles.
Suddenly we're infested and he understands the genesis of the tea party movement.
There's a lot of anger out there.
That's a classic stress rash.
Big-purchase induced.
I see it all the time at the dealership.
Guy comes in, puts down 100k for a car, skin starts flaking, hair starts falling out.
And the men who buy my cars do not have hair to spare.
All right, Amy's on her way over to look at houses.
Um, let me talk to you about something here that's been kind of...
And I feel really shallow for even bringing this up.
No, I am right there with you.
I do not know what's going on with Isabella's hair.
There is a pattern emerging with Julia where she de-glams herself.
She's out all day dazzling clients, looking awesome, putting on a show for the world, but when she gets home, out comes the sweats and the makeup towel.
Like the world's getting the ten.
I'm kind of getting, like, a 6.5.
So troubling, man.
I mean, comfort's great, but we must require excellence from each other, or the spark goes out.
Amy wears an array of sexy bras and underwear sets.
I return the favor by rocking tighty-whities and Western footwear.
I didn't realize it was excellence you were going after, but...
Ciao.
What is that?
Italian greeting.
Total immersion.
You know what?
It's nice.
What's wrong with this guy?
Julia has given up.
David, in his total acceptance, has created a safe haven for her sloth.
How bad is it?
Has she stopped sleeping in her nighttime jewelry?
It's bad.
Sweat pants.
Makeup towel.
How's the bedroom?
Is she applying herself, Dave?
Does she create an environment of safe experimentation and support?
She's your sister.
So I shouldn't be rooting for her pleasure?
Can't wait to get to Europe.
So tired of your puritanical views of sex.
All right.
Um, I think I'm gonna talk to her about it.
You should.
Yeah, if it's important to you, get it out in the open.
But this is a tricky area.
You got to be delicate, you know?
You stay positive.
Use words like "love" and "opportunity."
And then there are words to avoid.
Lackluster.
Lazy.
- Defeated.
- Greasy.
- Mailing it in.
- Letting it slide.
Not what I signed up for.
What's up?
Hey.
There she is.
Why don't you give me a little preview of tonight's duo?
Bang.
Excellence.
Here it is.
Take a look around.
Let me know what you think.
That's it?
That's your big pitch?
Owned for the last 60 years by little Elizabeth Markoff.
This stunning craftsman, lovingly restored, will transport you to a simpler time.
Four kids and eighteen grandchildren have filled this house with laughter and taken advantage of the half bath added in 1983.
It's not a house.
It's a home.
Pass.
Pass?
I love it.
Doggie door.
Really?
You'd like to live knowing a tiny man or child could crawl into our house at any time?
You're impossible.
You'll fall in love with anything.
Yeah.
It's a problem.
Hey, gorgeous.
What a day.
Oh, these tights.
Itchy and so sweaty, and so...
I just...
Let me get 'em...
Ugh.
Gross.
Can we talk?
Rex, I can't sleep.
Will you tell me about some of the great things you did today?
It relaxes me.
It was a good day.
Made a witty comment to a male Starbucks barista.
Not everyone does that.
What does it cost me?
Made his day.
Oh, and I weighed in on Dave's relationship.
Thanks to me, he's having an open conversation with Julia.
She needs it.
I visited her at work today.
We were walking across campus...
Parents' weekend is so sweet.
Oh, I know.
What's yours majoring in?
What?
- Okay.
- Oh.
So what supportive thing did you encourage Dave to tell her?
'Scusi.
Abort, abort.
She got called old, Dave.
Mission compromised.
I repeat, mission compromised.
Aah.
So you'd like me to be hotter?
No, no, no, not hotter.
You... as hot as you are...
Longer.
So you're saying that I don't tart it up enough for you?
No, that's not what I'm saying.
Nor am I saying that you're defeated.
Or that you've let it slide.
That last house was perfect.
It was near a school.
You know the sound of children's laughter makes me melancholy.
Dave, obviously, as our agent, you are available 24-7.
We need you to arbitrate.
We will be in your home office awaiting appropriate client snacks.
Butter cookies, cheez-its.
Okay?
How about that Amy?
Did you catch a glimpse of that cute little bra she had on?
I suppose all women have access to those?
Mission compromised.
Return to base.
I hope you're checking your voice mail.
These stupid bed bugs.
There are no bed bugs.
It's a stress rash like Rex said.
You're afraid of buying a house.
And do you know why?
You're afraid of committing to a life with me.
Quoting Rex.
This is what you've been reduced to?
That's a good point.
This is an opportunity.
I'm not being pretty enough for you.
I am wasting all of my "getting pretty" time making money.
Ugly money.
Honey, I'm not saying...
You know what?
Maybe I should work less.
I think that's a really good idea.
Oh, shoot, but you know what?
If I work less, then how are we gonna handle that shortfall of cash?
You know what?
You could work a little harder.
We don't even need to...
No, no, no.
This is good.
This is great.
Because while I am at the bra store, asking myself, "is this gonna do it for my hubby,"
maybe you could just be selling more houses.
Yeah.
Instead of leaving work at 2:00 in the afternoon with vance because the two of you haven't quote "bowled" in a while.
I'm gonna say something that's gonna upset you.
We need to see a couple's therapist about this.
Okay.
Put me in a bind.
If I act upset, I seem predictable.
But if I assent to your wishes,
I appear to condone the dark arts of the social sciences.
I'm not going.
Oh, my God.
I take it back.
I don't even... your 6.5 is great, by the way.
A 6.5?
So you've given me a numerical rating.
Oh, neat.
So it's like a beauty pageant?
Is there... can I...
I was joking.
'Cause I... well, thought it would make you laugh.
It was a bad... you know, 'cause we're always making fun of people like that.
You know?
Like, what if I was that guy?
I just want to find a great house.
I'm not gonna settle.
I don't want to mail it in like Dave says Julia is.
Vance is in on the joke.
He's the one that, like...
It's probably more clever than funny.
You never answer your phone.
Last night I saw a Puerto Rico license plate.
Now this.
What's it gonna take, Dave?
Just drive, man.
You got to stand up a little.
Just try... no, put your feet on the ground.
- You're not...
- Almost there.
You shouldn't send friends to voice mail.
Well, you and Rex have been to couples therapy.
How did you get him to go?
First time can be tough.
Tell me about the nature of your relationship.
This isn't a strip club, is it?
You have to go see Dr. Dahlquist.
She is a miracle worker.
Hey, guys.
- Hey.
- You will not believe what Dave is trying to pull.
I come home exhausted from 12 hours of work and he has the nerve to take issue with the fact that I like to put on my casuals and get a little comfortable.
You do get comfortable.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Stay in a ball gown and full makeup all night long?
That makeup towel does get a workout.
Oh, come on, guys.
Where's my sex in the city bitch fest?
Honey, we would love to sit here and rhyme things with labia, but this is about your marriage.
And you could stand to try a little harder.
What about feminism?
What did our weird aunts die for?
Let's not get hung up on principles.
This is about maintaining a standard for the couple.
Look, men will always do the bare minimum unless we shame them into more.
- And it's not easy.
- No.
I wear high heels all the time to look sexy.
It's weakening my ankle bones.
Do you have clicky foot?
Stage five.
Oh, God, that's awful.
Yeah.
That's what it sounds like.
If I were a horse, they'd put me down.
Because I'm committed to my relationship,
I never go number two in our house.
I have a gym membership solely for that purpose.
So somewhere between her and me is probably where you're gonna want to settle in.
Dahlquist, huh?
I thought I knew all the other real estate agents in town.
She's supposed to be great.
And, you know, it's good we're giving Dave a break.
We're a lot to handle.
You know what I like about this place?
There's no maps, there's no listings, you know?
It's subtle, but the passion is clear.
This is a woman who was put on this earth to sell houses.
Yeah.
Welcome.
I'm Lindsay dahlquist.
Hi.
Vance.
What brings us together today?
Uh, well, we're looking for a house.
Mm.
Big move.
That can be very stressful.
She's got a soft voice.
She's commanding my attention.
Uh, so here's the deal.
I love mid-century modern... but before we talk about real estate issues, maybe we should talk about vance and why he has difficulty deciding things.
- What?
- Let's explore that.
I don't think this is really about looking for a home.
I think this is about the two of you and...
Connection.
How's your sex life?
Robust.
Tempestuous.
And we don't believe in taboos.
I appreciate your openness.
Yeah, I'm digging you too.
I can work with her.
- Interested in some post-work comfort?
Sweat pants, makeup towel.
We didn't talk all day.
You left so early.
And there's a little bit of a radio silence on my apology emails?
Although maybe I got the address wrong.
Is it still gorgeous love of my life at most special wife dot com?
Honey, I am so, so sorry.
I... it came out the wrong... everything about it was stupid.
I'm a shallow bastar...
Here's your ten.
Oh, my...
Now earn it.
What?
I'll be waiting downstairs.
Make yourself pretty, and show me the night of my life.
Bang.
I was this height when I was in fifth grade, and the doctors told me that I would be seven foot one, and I think...
Well, I think that's...
I think that's why I'm so adamant about the house having...
having high ceilings.
I can't help but notice you've made several very specific real estate digressions.
Well, that's vance, you know?
It's his job.
It's his identity.
It probably has to do with his parents' divorce.
Maybe we want to explore that?
Well, you know, my dad left when I was eight, and I think that's why I throw like a girl.
And... you know what?
I think you should show us some houses.
I'm sorry.
You want me to show you houses?
I mean, you're a real estate agent.
I'm a therapist.
Slash real estate agent.
I was led to believe.
No?
That's a... what?
Amy, what the hell?
You're sick.
You have a crippling fear of commitment, and you need help.
You doubted me and you've deceived me.
That's the double d.
See?
Here's his obsession with big breasts.
Stop revealing things to her.
And you.
I opened up to you 'cause I thought you were a licensed real estate agent.
She really said that?
Yeah.
And she wants the night of her life.
And it has to be with you?
Yeah, it has to be with me.
What are you...?
I got your call.
Sorry.
I was busy being the victim of Amy's emotional terrorism.
Uh, Julia wants a night?
She turned the tables on him.
Oh, she's good.
We should have seen this coming.
What are you wearing?
What do you think of this tie?
It's awful.
It's nothing.
That tie is a non-swing.
Vance, I'm so glad you're here.
It's been like this the whole time.
What about bowtie?
No.
It promises an intelligence you won't be delivering.
And picture it around that huge neck.
It'll be like you're giving her a stump as a present.
All right.
No, we're finally talking about the neck.
Do lovers carve their initials in it?
Do vermonters tap it for syrup?
Okay, you're done.
Where are you gonna take her?
- Julia's, you know, she likes authentic, simple low-key.
Don't be cheap, man.
Cafe Pierre.
Dave, that was uncool.
Don't shut me down like that.
I'm staying with him.
Amy issues.
I didn't want to burden you.
Rex is not a great listener, but the gelato here is sick, right?
Take her to cafe Pierre, get the tasting menu with the wine pairings, give the waiter a $50, and get a nice table.
I don't know.
Now it feels like we're making a big production out of it.
Are we putting too much pressure on this?
No, Dave.
Stakes couldn't be higher.
Will you be able to reclaim your magic, or have you slid too far and lost it forever?
Ciao!
So do you have room for dessert?
Put that away, sweetie.
It's all taken care of.
Happy Birthday, madame.
Thank you.
I love when we pretend it's my birthday.
To my perfect ten.
Oh, that means a lot coming from a perfect ten.
Thank you.
You know what, baby?
We are great at this.
Yeah.
There's no reason why we can't just do this all the time.
This is the new us.
I like it.

Oh, my God.
I just want to go to bed, man.
We ask one thing of our guests.
Stay nine hours ahead of Pacific Standard Time.
- And we have a very strict Rex-only nude policy.
Don't let the old lady rattle you.
There's some wiggle room.
- Vance.
- Amy?
I'm so sorry I doubted you.
The bed bugs are real.
I'm covered in them.
- I told you, I'm not a commitment-phobe.
I'm just a picky jerk.
Dahlquist, you've done it again, you magnificent bitch.
Cognac?
Oh, don't mind if I do.
Another magical evening.
- I hate this.
- I hate it more.
I'm so tired.
I have so many hooks digging into me to make this look work.
So do I. It is really hard being a ten.
I'll race you to a four?
Wait, wait, wait, though.
Are we sure we want to do this?
Because we did kind of fall into a rut before.
But now we know we can be tens whenever we want.
So let's do it.
Like, once a month.
The tenth of every month.
We'll call it the tens on the tens.
In the meantime...
You get your makeup towel.
And release that neck from your collared prison.
Oh, and let's get pizza!
Hey guys!
Sorry to barge in at seven in the morning.
- Mama, two more for dinner.
- Oh ... more manicotti.
I don't really know what this is, but I'm not one to say no to morning wine.
Well, we have a little bug situation all of a sudden.
Yeah, apparently they jumped off of your clothes and into our house.
You guys mind if we crash here?
You're family, where else are you gonna go?
Sit, sit.
Mangia, mangia.
- You have any cereal or anything?
- Just go with it.
Nobody likes the "Ugly American"
Ppened last:
Will's old rival, bryan ryan
Tried to cancel the club.
You're done here.
Then he was really into it.
- ***
- Then he tried to cancel it again.
You think you're helping these kids when all you're doing is setting them up to be jaded and bitter.
Finn's mom's dating Kurt's dad, which was totally part of
Kurt's plan to get closer to Finn,
When will you learn that nothing is impossible when it comes to love?
Artie told Tina what his greatest dream was, then realized that not every dream is achievable.
Is that even a word-- achievable?
Achievatate?
Achievalize?
Okay, you just said, like, ten offensive things.
Jessie pushed Rachel to find out who her mom was, and it turns out it's Shelby Corcoran, the coach of Vocal Adrenaline.
I want a look that's so optimistic, it could cure cancer.
Geez.
And that's what you missed on Glee.
Am I in trouble?
Come on.
You've got more self-esteem than that.
I think this might have something to do with your perfect attendance last semester.
No.
Miss Cohen-Chang is in trouble.
It has come to my attention that the look you sport is what is known as goth.
American teens are coming down with a serious case of Twilight fever, transformed from normal children into vampires obsessed with the occult.
And only yesterday, this dark specter reared its head at McKinley High.
This is totally going to get Robert Pattinson's attention.
[hissing]
Oh, hey.
[girls roaring] [all screaming] Oh, dear God!
I don't mean to state the obvious, but you do know that vampires aren't real, right?
They don't exist.
William, denial will not make this problem go away!
My parents won't even let me watch Twilight.
My mom says she thinks Kristin Stewart seems like a bitch.
This is a serious problem!
Miss Cohen-Chang, you've got to find yourself another style of dress!
Hold on a second.
Tina is shy, and one way she's found to express herself is through her clothes.
High school is an incredibly important time when kids get to explore who they are.
When I was in high school, I had a whole year where I dressed exactly like Kurt Cobain.
I mean, come on.
There has to be someone who you used to dress like.
Yes.
For several years in my early 20s,
I dressed up as Elvis.
But he was a Christian, Will!
And he did not possess the ability to transform into a bat!
[whispers]:
I think he thinks vampires are real.
I think you're right.
Studies have shown that a strict dress code fosters a safe and stable learning environment with fewer instances of gang violence and vampirism.
So, if I see you dressed in lacy demon clothes again,
Tina Cohen-Chang, [pounds desk]
You will be suspended!
Step.
Couple more.
Is there a car down here from me?
Honey, we're indoors.
Oh.
Okay.
And open your eyes.
Sparkling cider?
Yeah.
"Welcome home"?
But who went somewhere?
Burt asked us to move in with them.
And this is how you're telling me?
The party is my idea.
If you're gonna say something, say it loud, right?
BURT:
Yeah.
It's gonna take some getting used to, but trust me, you're gonna love it, okay?
Now you don't have to drag your tail over here every time you want to watch something on the old 55-incher.
We got a lot of food-- some ethnic food.
It's some ethnicity that's not ours.
Tuna cruditÃ©s.
Tuna cruditÃ©s.
It's not ethnic.
Here you go.
CAROLE:
Finn, this house is twice as big as ours.
It has two bathrooms.
Two and a half.
I don't want an extra bathroom or a tuna crude.
I just want my house back.
I think I know what this resistance is about.
Our room.
And I couldn't agree more.
The palate in here is totally unflattering to your skin tone.
Not everyone can pull off Dior gray.
We need to redecorate.
Wait, we're sharing a room?
I'm not cool with that!
CAROLE:
Baby, I know it's weird, okay?
But can't be much of a surprise.
And, in time, you're gonna be as happy as I am.
Yeah, look, I'll knock out a wall upstairs,
I'll put an addition on, okay?
But-but until then, maybe this will grease the wheels a bit, huh?
Oh.
Hey.
Look, that's 300.
Oh, my...
Have at it.
You redecorate this place.
Don't worry, roomie.
Mr. Ikea Catalog and I will have this all figured out.
I am going to put together a palate that expresses who you are and who I want you to be.
Who you want to be.
Hey, what night's game night?
You play Sorry?
You know...
He will now.
[chuckles]
I will...
[singsongy]:
Sorry.
I will beat you.
It's so weird.
This so isn't you.
I feel like an Asian Branch Davidian.
Tina, are there any other looks you can try?
Biker chick?
Cowgirl?
Hood rat.
Computer programmer.
Cross-country skier.
Catholic schoolgirl.
Happy Meal, no onions.
Or a chicken.
Look, I appreciate it, guys, but it just isn't me.
I know who I am, and I'm not allowed to show it.
It's like communism.
Guys, we have a serious problem.
You know how I've been doing some deep background on Vocal Adrenaline?
Isn't that against the rules?
No, not at all.
Or probably.
Whatever!
Anyway, what I figured out;
I rooted through the Dumpsters behind the Carmel auditorium and I found 18 empty boxes of Christmas lights.
Oh, no.
Which led me to Joelle Fabrics.
I asked them about red Chantilly lace.
They were sold out.
Oh, sweet Jesus.
Oh, my.
Wait, what?
- They're doing Gaga.
- That's it.
It's over.
Exactly.
We should have guessed it.
They're going for full-out theatricality.
They know it's the easiest way to beat us.
Damn them.
What's up with this Gaga dude?
He just, like, dresses weird, right?
Like Bowie?
[scoffs] Lady Gaga is a woman.
She's only the biggest pop act to come along in decades.
She's boundary-pushing, the most theatrical performer of our generation.
And she changes her look faster than Brit changes sexual partners.
That's true.
ARTIE:
It makes sense that
Vocal Adrenaline would pay homage.
It's a brilliant move.
She's a perfect fit for them.
Hold on a second.
We might be able to kill two birds with one stone here.
We can help Tina find a new look and nd a competitive number for regionals.
This week, your assignment:
Gaga.
[gasping, murmuring] RACHEL:
Pens, we need pens.
My ideas just come to me.
Uh, my office.
Right there.
I'm brainstorming.
It's coming.
And claw, claw, uh, clap, clap.
And five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four...
Think they can see us?
[whispering]:
If they catch us, are we gonna have to go to jail?
Stealing their ideas is not a crime.
SHELBY:
...six, seven, eight.
And one, two...
Your shoes are making noise.
...and five, six, seven, eight.
And one, two, three, four, five, six and seven...
They look amazing.
Claw, claw, uh, clap, clap.
And five, six-- uh, uh...
Okay, okay, okay, just... enough.
You guys aren't getting it.
Your letting the costumes do all the work.
Theatricality isn't about crazy outfits.
It's not enough to douse yourselves with gasoline.
You have to light yourselves on fire to make it work.
God, she's good.
But being theatrical doesn't mean you have to be a nuclear explosion.
It can be like, like a quiet storm.
You just have to radiate emotion, express what's deep inside you.
That's what theatricality is truly about.
Do I have to demonstrate?
"Funny Girl," E flat.
# Barbra Streisand's "Funny Girl" #
Exactly what I would have done:
Barbra.
I could do it in my sleep.
- * Funny - *
- * Did you hear that?
- *
- * Funny - *
- * Yeah, the guy said, "Honey - *
- * You're a funny girl" - *
- * That's me - *
- * I just keep them in stitches - *
- * Doubled in half - *
- * And though I may be - *
- * All wrong for the guy - *
- * I'm good for a laugh - *
- * I guess it's not funny - *
- * Life is far from sunny - *

Ms. Corcoran?
I'm Rachel Berry, I'm your daughter.
Did you ever regret it?
Yes.
Then no.
Then so much.
W-When did you realize it was the right time for me to find you?
[chuckles]
I saw you sing at sectionals.
You were extraordinary.
You were me.
[chuckles]
Was it hard for you to not become a star?
To not have your dreams come true?
It felt like a broken promise.
Like the Fisher King's wound-- never heals.
Wow.
Genetics really are amazing.
You see the world with the same fierce theatricality as I do.
Even the way we're sitting right now is so dramatic, and yet we feel so comfortable with it.
I've missed so much.
How do you feel?
Thirsty.
When I was little and I used to get sad, my dads would bring me a glass of water.
It got so I couldn't tell if I was sad or just thirsty.
I shouldn't have done this.
This was supposed to feel good.
W-We were supposed to have some kind of slow-motion run into each other's arms.
This is all wrong.
Maybe we can just go to dinner or something just to get over the initial shock.
I'm so sorry, Rachel.
Uh...
I'll...
I'll call you.
Oh, hey, Finn, come on in.
I'm learning all this amazing stuff about Lady Gaga.
She's got this thing called the "Haus of Gaga," which is like, this collective of artists and designers who collaborate on, on her styles and stage sets and her music.
I think it's an exciting model for what we could be doing in Glee Club.
Yeah, that's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about.
I don't want to do Lady Gaga.
And I suspect that...
with the exception of Kurt... that none of the other guys are gonna want to do it either.
I just feel like we're always doing whatever the girls want us to do.
Yeah. [Will] Yeah, you're right.
Maybe I haven't been listening to you guys hard enough.
So let's find a solution.
Well, I, uh, I actually already have one.
You're wrong.
It's a really good name.
It's a rock star name.
You want to name our daughter "Jack Daniels"?
She's a girl!
Okay, fine, whatever.
Jackie Daniels.
The name is not the point.
I told you this.
I'm giving up the baby so I don't have to do this with you.
This is good for you.
Now you can go off and be a rock star yourself.
I love wearing champagne bubbles!
I get to express a whole different side of myself!
Because even though I'm painfully shy and obsessed with death, I'm a really effervescent person.
Excuse me!
Were you dropped on your heads?
!
What was that?
I think you heard me.
I'm just saying.
Pick on me-- that's fine-- but don't throw around a girl.
Well, you know, lately, we haven't been able to tell the difference.
We're not gaga for Gaga.
You dress all freaky, and then you rub it in everybody's faces.
I don't want to look at it all day!
It's weird.
It makes my eyes tired.
If you want to switch it up a bit, just go from Gap to Banana Republic.
It's called being theatrical.
We're showing off who you are.
It's the same thing you do when you go to school with your football uniforms on.
You're expressing yourself, and we have every right to do the same.
Well, you know what?
The next time you want to express yourself a little like a circus freak, don't be shocked when my fist feels like expressing itself against your chin!
Okay?
Knock that crazy fool crepe-paper nonsense offa you.
Let's go.
Yeah, you don't want to be late for your appointment at Supercuts!
Watch your mouth, homo!
And you know what, fancy?
You don't need an appointment at Supercuts.
They love walk-ins.
- [both chortle] - [school bell rings]
Little monsters, take a bow.
[Will laughs, applause]
All right!
Ladies, Kurt, I am really, really impressed.
Sientete.
You know, you know what the best part is?
Each one of those costumes shows off a different aspect of your personalities.
Wait.
Where's Rachel?
I mean, I only noticed because, like, five minutes have gone by without her saying something totally obnoxious.
Rachel kinda got some intense news yesterday.
We were spying on Vocal Adrenaline, and...
You guys, that's not fair!
You gotta stop doing that.
But, uh, you know, what, what'd you find out?
- Okay, y'all ready?
- Miss Corcoran, their coach?
She's Richel's mom.
Are you serious?
Way to bury the lead, Mercedes.
PUCK:
We're screwed.
Rachel's gonna jump ship over to Vocal Adrenaline.
Never.
I really don't want to talk about it, though.
I'm still processing the news.
And my dads are moving my therapist to our spare room later this afternoon.
All I can know is that I'm not going anywhere, and I've chosen a Lady Gaga look that expresses the longing for a childhood
I was deprived of.
You look terrible.
I look awesome.
I think it's the Kermit-the-Frog look.
KURT:
And we have a jumper.
Well, my dads can't sew, so these are just stapled on.
Guys, why don't we worry about this later, and maybe try to focus on the song?
Couldn't agree more.
Hit it!

All right!
What up, Finn?
What's that on your face?
You got a bad pimple or something?
A Finn-ple?
[both laugh]
Dude, are you wearing makeup?
I knew it was contagious.
You moved in with that little Kurt kid, and now you got a bad case of the gay.
It's just something for Glee Club, all right?
Oh, well, then it's definitely not gay, huh?
Get out of my way!
Man, how many times do we got go through this?
!
You being a jock and being in this Glee Club does not make you versatile.
It makes you bisexual.
And if we have to kick your ass to make you understand that, then our schedules are wide open.
Get out of my bathroom.
You girls, y'all belong across the hallway.
Glee boy!
[Karofsky laughs] [sighs] [dance music playing]
[music stops]
Yeah, that's better, guys.
Take five.
And, ladies, I don't want to hear about chafing just because you're being forced to wear metal underwear.
Not my problem.
Mom?
Hon, you gotta stop sneaking into these rehearsals.
It's kind of important.
Oh, dear God.
My dads can't sew.
I really need a mom right now.
Do you think you can help?
Sorry I'm late.
Whoa, looking good, Rachel!
Thanks.
My mom made it.
Very nice.
[Mercedes laughs]
Well, we're all here, so without further ado,
I'd like to introduce The Boys!
ARTIE:
Lima, Ohio, get ready to rock!
- [girls laugh] - [KISS' "Shout It Out" begins] - [cheering]
- * Well, the night is young and you want some fun - *
- * Do you think you're gonna find it?
- *
- * Think you're gonna find it?
- *
GIRLS:
Whoo!
- * You got to treat yourself like number one - *
- * Do you need to be reminded?
- *
- * Need to be reminded?
- *
Whoo!
- * It doesn't matter what you do or say - *
- * Just forget the things that you've been told - *
- * We can't do it any other way - *
- * Everybody's got to rock and roll - *
- * Oh, oh, oh, ooh !
- *
- * Shout it, shout it - *
- * Shout it out loud!
- *
- * Shout it, shout it - *
- * Shout it out loud!
- *
- * If you don't feel good - *
- * There's a way you could - *
- * Don't sit there broken-hearted - *
- * Sit there broken-hearted!
- *
- * Call all your friends in the neighborhood - *
- * And get the party started - *
- * Get the party started - *
- * Don't let 'em tell you that there's too much noise - *
- * They're too old to really understand - * [girls laughing]
- * You'll still get rowdy - *
- * With the girls and boys - *
- * 'Cause it's time for you to take a stand - *
- * Yeah, yeah - *
- * Yeah!
Shout it, shout it - *
- * Shout it out loud!
- *
- * You got to have a party - *
- * Shout it, shout it - *
- * Shout it out loud!
- *
- * Turn it up louder - *
- * Shout it, shout it - *
- * Shout it out loud!
- *
- * Oh, yeah-yeah!
- *
- * Shout it, shout it - *
- * Shout it out loud!
- *
- * Hear it getting louder - *
- * Shout it, shout it - *
- * Shout it out loud!
- * [song ends] [girls cheering]
All right, guys, very impressive.
Very, very...
loud.
[chuckles]
But what, uh, what does that performance express?
And what do those costumes illustrate?
We did our research, Mr. Shue.
Yeah, Finn's demon look is because Gene Simmons liked comic books as a kid, and they called Paul Stanley the "Star Child"
because he was a romantic or something.
But that doesn't really explain my whore lips.
And my Ace Frehley is supposed to be a spaceman from another planet.
Mike's iconic catman is because Peter Criss claimed to have nine lives.
Yeah, And I'm dressed as the guy who replaced Artie when he quit.
Well, congratulations, guys.
Job well done.
Let's give it up for the boys!
[cheering]
I thought the boys' KISS number was good, although the lyrics did leave something to be desired.
And Finn kept sticking his tongue out and I couldn't stop picturing him licking stuff.
It was disturbing.
We warned you.
Now Gaga's got to go.
Could you have a word with Azimio and Karofsky about harassing me without damaging my Gaga outfit?
Are you serious?
Do you know how difficult it is with those guys?
They already think we're boyfriends.
Let them think what they want.
They're Neanderthals.
In three years, they'll be cleaning my septic tank.
Don't you get it?
It's not just them.
We live in Ohio-- not New York or San Francisco or some other city where people eat vegetables that aren't fried.
I don't understand why you always need to make such a big spectacle of yourself.
Why can't you just work harder at blending in?
I'm sure that'd be easier for you.
You know, it would.
You are such a boy.
You're going to have to use a moist towelette if you want to get that makeup off.
Don't touch me!
What is your problem, Finn?
It's just a moist towelette!
I'm gonna finish in the laundry room.
Grow up, Finn!
I know why you called, and don't worry about it.
My reconnection with Rachel is not some kind of plot to mess with you guys before regionals.
I'm not worried about regionals.
It's Rachel.
She's special.
She's got all of the best of you.
She's strong-willed, dramatic, wildly talented.
Go on.
But she's not hard like you.
She's fragile.
over-emotional.
And she's clearly convinced herself that you are as committed to this reunion as she is.
And I don't think you are.
You're not prepared to have a teenage daughter.
Are you?
I can't have any more kids.
There were issues a few years back.
Then some surgery, and that's that.
I really wanted a daughter.
That's why it was so important to me to make that bond with her.
But you're right.
I wanted my baby back.
Rachel's an adult now.
She doesn't need me.
Shelby,
I can't tell you what to do...
But if you really love her, you have to tell her what you just told me.
KURT:
I had to skip school to finish it, but I think you're really going to like it.
Consider it a peace offering after all the yelling that we've been doing.
I used Marlene Dietrich and Gary Cooper in Morocco as my inspiration.
It's a perfect blend of the masculine and the feminine, the muted and the theatrical.
Are you freaking insane?
I can't live here.
I'm a dude.
What the hell is that supposed to be?
It's a privacy partition
It's all I could find on such short notice.
Why are you getting angry about everything?
I worked hard on thi
That's not a privacy partition!
Why is it so hard for you to understand?
I don't want to get dressed in front of you!
Do you know that
I put my underwear on in the shower before I come out when you're around?
I just...
I don't want to have to worry about that kind of stuff in my own room, man.
And what stuff are you referring to?
You know.
You know what I'm talking about.
Don't play dumb.
Why can't you just accept that I'm not like you?
I have accepted that.
No, you haven't.
You think I don't see the way you stare at me?
How flirty you get.
You think I don't know why you got so excited that we were going to be moving in together?
It's just a room, Finn!
We can redecorate it if you want to!
Okay, good.
Well, then the first thing that needs to go is that faggy lamp.
And then we need to get rid of this faggy couch cover...
Hey!
What did you just call him?
Oh, no, no, I didn't call him anything.
I was talking to the blanket.
If you use that word, you're talking about him.
Relax, Dad.
I didn't take it that way.
Yeah, that's because you're 16 and you still assume the best in people.
You live a few years, you start seeing the hate in people's hearts.
Even the best people.
You use the "N" word?
Of course not.
How about "retard"?
You call that nice girl in Cheerios!
with Kurt, you call her a retard?
Becky-- no.
She's my friend.
She's got Down syndrome.
I'd never call her that.
That's cruel.
But you think it's okay to come into my house and say "faggy"?
That's not what I meant...
I know what you meant!
What, you think I didn't use that word when I was your age?
You know, some kid gets clocked in practice, we'd tell him to stop being such a fag.
Shake it off.
We meant it exactly the way you meant it.
That being gay is wrong.
That it's some kind of punishable offense.
I really thought you were different, Finn.
You know, I thought that being in Glee Club and being raised by your mom meant that you were some, you know, new generation of dude who saw things differently.
Who just kind of, you know, came into the world knowing what has taken me years of struggling to figure out.
I guess I was wrong.
I'm sorry, Finn, but you can't... you can't stay here.
Dad.
I love your mom.
And maybe this is going to cost me her, but my family comes first.
I can't have that kind of poison around.
This is our home, Kurt.
He is my son.
Out in the world, you do what you want, but not under my roof.
The place looks great.
- You should be in orbit.
- My balls keep fallinoff.
Been there.
I want to talk about this.
There's not much to say.
I feel sorry for you.
I thought you were different.
I am different.
WILL:
All right, let's get things started.
Mr. Shue.
There's something I want to say to Quinn.
And I want everybody to hear it.
All right.
At first I didn't really get this theatrical assignment, being larger than life and putting it all out there, 'cause I'm kind of like that all the time.
That's how my dad was, too.
He was too busy being all crazy and rock and roll to be there for his kid.
And you know what?
I didn't care that my dad was a badass.
I just wanted him to be there.
And he never was.
And then I learned all this KISS stuff and while Jackie Daniels is a great name for like a powerboat or something, it's not right for a baby girl.
So if my KISS mates will help me out, I got a better idea.
Grab a stool, guys.
[KISS' "Beth" intro playing]
- * Beth, I hear you calling - *
- * But I can't come home right now - *
- * Me and the boys are playing - *
- * And we just can't find the sound - *
- * Just a few more hours - *
- * And I'll be right home to you - *
- * I think I hear them calling - *
- * Oh, Beth, what can I do?
- *
- * Beth, what can I do?
- *
- * You say you feel so empty - *
- * That our house just ain't our home - *
- * I'm always somewhere else - *
- * And you're always there alone - *
- * Just a few more hours - *
- * And I'll be right home to you - *
- * I think I hear them calling - *
- * Oh, Beth, what can I do?
- *
- * Beth, what can I do?
- *
- * Beth, I know you're lonely - *
- * And I hope you'll be all right - *
- * 'Cause me and the boys will be playing all night - *
- * All night. - *
I know you're giving her up, but before you do, I think you should name her Beth.
If you'll let me,
I'd really like to be there when she's born.
I'd really like to meet her.
So, how'd your dads come up with the name "Rachel"?
They were, um, big Friends fans.
I know why you're here... to say good-bye.
I really wanted this to work.
Do you know what really turned me?
That story that you told me about your dads, and how they'd bring you water when you were sad.
We're never gonna have anything like that.
It's too late for us.
I just think that anything we share right now is gonna be confusing for you.
I just don't understand.
You're my mom.
I feel awful right now, and I should want to just fall into your arms and let you rock me and tell me everything is gonna be fine, but...
I just don't feel it.
It's because I'm your mother, but I'm not your mom.
So what?
Do we just pretend we don't know each other now?
That seems silly.
Let's just be grateful for one another... from afar.
For a while.
Don't think for a second I'm gonna go soft on you during regionals.
[sniffles] Bring it. [chuckles]
Can I have a hug good-bye?
Sure.
[sniffles]
Can you do me one more favor?
Sometime when you're thirsty... can you get yourself some water from this cup?
Gold stars are kinda my thing.
Of course. [chuckles]
Shelby... before you go, will... will you sing with me?
Just one time.
It's sort of a fantasy of mine, and it would really mean a lot to me.
I would be honored.
Brad!
He's always just around.
Um, take that.
Here you go.
[chuckles]

You are really, really good.
[sniffling]
[school bell ringing] Whoa!
Guys, why are you all in your theatricality costumes?
It's the end of the week.
We were kinda hoping to learn what the lesson of the assignment was.
Well, um... you guys have had some great numbers this week, but I'm not totally sure that I know either.
[all laugh]
I do.
I refuse to dress like somebody I'm not to be somebody I'm not.
And I learned it's good to be a little theatrical.
[gasps]
So here's what's going to happen.
My dad-- he's the king of the vampires.
And Asian vampires are the most vicious of all the vampires.
You're going to let me wear my lady demon clothes, or my dad will fly into your bedroom and bite your face off.
He's really pissed.
Is that what you want?
No, I don't want that.
I'm afraid.
Good.
I'm glad we had this talk.
Now I have to go back to my coffin because the light is burning my eyes!
[applause] There she is.
[all cheering]
Wait.
Where's Kurt?
Where's Finn?
Fine.
You want to hit me?
You want to beat me up?
Go ahead.
But I swear to you I will never change.
I'm proud to be different.
It's the best thing about me.
So go ahead, hit me.
I believe I will.
Sir, would you like to go first?
FINN:
You're not hitting anyone.
Oh, my God.
Is he wearing a red rubber dress or am I trippin'?
I want to thank you, Kurt.
I realize I still have a lot to learn, but the reason I'm here right now... in a shower curtain, is... because of you.
And I'm not going to let anyone lay a hand on you.
[chuckles] Oh, really, dude?
'Cause I'm pretty sure we can take both of you.
PUCK:
Yeah?
But can you take all of us?
AZIMIO:
Okay.
Okay, I get it.
I took biology.
You know what, Karofsky?
We done disturbed the freak hive.
The worker freaks is trying to protect the queen freak.
Next time... we'll bring some friends, too.
I'm tired of everyone calling us freaks.
Welllook at us.
We are freaks.
[all laugh]
But we're all freaks together.
And we shouldn't have to hide it.
[Will clapping]
Nice job, Finn.
I think you just figured out what the lesson was.
Kinda makes me wish I had planned it.
But Mercedes is right, You do all look incredibly insane.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're so welcome.
WILL:
Anyways, let's get back to work before you're all forced to join the circus.
Next stop?
Regionals.
Funny
Did you hear that?
Funny
Yeah, the guy said:
Honey you're a funny girl that's me
I just keep them in stitches
Doubled in half
And though I may be
All wrong for the guy
I'm good for a laugh
I guess it's not funny
Life is far from sunny
When the laugh is over
And the joke's on you
A girl ought to have a sense of humor
That's one thing
You really need for sure
When you're a funny girl
The fellow said a funny girl

So marvelous
She's got to love nobody.
Can't read my Can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face.
She's got to love nobody.
So here's what happened last week.
Will's old rival tried to cancel the club.
- You're done here.
- Then he was really into it.
I got custom-made jean jackets.
Then he tried to cancel it again.
You think you're helping these kids... when all you're doing is setting them up to be jaded and bitter.
Finn's mom's dating Kurt's dad, which was totally part of Kurt's plan to get closer to Finn... who he's always sorta had a crush on.
When will you learn that nothing is im possible when it comes to love?
Artie told Tina what his greatest dream was... then realized that not every dream is achievable.
Is that even a word- achievable?
Achievitate?
Achievalize?
Okay, you just said, like, 10 offensive things.
Jesse pushed Rachel to find out who her mom was... and it turns out it's Shelby Corcoran, the coach of Vocal Adrenaline.
I want a look that's so optimistic, it could cure cancer.
Geez.
And that's what you missed on Glee.
- Am I in trouble?
- Come on.
You've got more self-esteem than that.
This might have something to do with your perfect attendance last semester.
No, Miss Cohen-Chang is in trouble.
It has come to my attention that the look you sport is what is known as Goth.
American teens are coming down with a serious case of Twilight fever... transformed from normal children into vampires obsessed with the occult.
And only yesterday this dark specter reared its head at McKinley High.
This is totally gonna get Robert Pattinson's attention.
- [ Hissing ]
- Oh, hey!
- [ Growling ] - [ Shrieking ]
- [ Roaring ]
- Oh, dear God!
I don't mean to state the obvious... but you do know that vampires aren't real, right?
- They don't exist?
- William, denial will not make this problem go away.
My parents won't even let me watch Twilight.
My mom says she thinks Kristen Stewart seems like a bitch.
This is a serious problem.
Miss Cohen-Chang, you've got to find another style of dress!
Hold on a second.
Tina is shy, and one way she's found to express herself is through her clothes.
High school is an incredibly important time when kids get to explore who they are.
When I was in high school I had a whole year where I dressed exactly like Kurt Cobain.
Come on.
There has to be someone you used to dress like.
Yes, for several years in my early '20s I dressed up as Elvis... but he was a Christian, Will, and he did not possess the ability to transform into a bat!
- I think he thinks vampires are real.
- I think you're right.
Studies have shown that a strict dress code... fosters a safe and stable learning environment... with fewer instances of gang violence and vampirism.
So if I see you dressed in lacy demon clothes again, Tina Cohen-Chang... you will be suspended!
Step.
One more.
Is there a car down here for me?
- Honey, we're indoors.
- Oh.
And open your eyes!
Sparkling cider?
Yeah.
"Welcome home"?
But who went somewhere?
Burt asked us to move in with them.
And this is how you're telling me?
The party was my idea.
If you're gonna say something, say it loud, right?
Yeah, it's gonna take some getting used to, but you're gonna love it.
Now you don't have to drag your tail over here every time you wanna watch the 55-incher.
We got a lot of food.
Some ethnic food.
It's some ethnicity that's not ours.
- Look how pretty that is.
- Want a crudite?
There you go.
Finn, this house is twice as big as ours.
It has two bathrooms.
- Two and a half.
- I don't want an extra bathroom.
Or a tuna... crude.
I just want my house back.
I think I know what this resistance is about.
Our room.
And I couldn't agree more.
The palette in here is totally unflattering to your skin tone.
Not everyone can pull off Dior gray.
- We need to redecorate.
- Wait.
We're sharing a room?
- I'm not cool with that.
- Baby, I know it's weird.
Okay?
But it can't be much of a surprise, and in time you're gonna be as happy as I am.
Look, I'll knock down a wall upstairs, I'll put an addition on.
But until then maybe this'll grease the wheels a bit?
Huh?
Hey, look, there's 300.
Have at it.
You redecorate.
Don't worry, roomie.
Mr. Ikea Catalog and I will have this all figured out.
I am going to put together a palette that expresses who you are and who I want you to be- who you want to be.
Hey, what night's game night?
You play Sorry?
- You know.
- You will now.
- Sorry!
- I will
- I will beat you.
- It's so weird.
- This so isn't you.
I feel like an Asian Branch Davidian.
- Tina, are there any other looks you can try?
- Biker chick?
- Cowgirl?
- Hood rat.
- Computer programmer.
- Cross-country skier.
- Catholic schoolgirl?
- A Happy Meal, no onions.
Or a chicken.
Look, I appreciate it, guys, but it just isn't me.
I know who I am, and I'm not allowed to show it.
It's like communism.
Guys, we have a serious problem.
I've been doing some deep background on Vocal Adrenaline.
- Isn't that against the rules?
- No, not at all.
Or probably.
Whatever.
Anyway, what I figured out, I rooted through the Dumpsters behind the Carmel auditorium... and I found 1 8 empty boxes of Christmas lights.
- Oh, no.
- Which led me to Joelle Fabrics.
I asked them about red Chantilly lace, and they were sold out!
- Oh, sweet Jesus.
- Oh, my.
- W-W-What?
- They're doing Gaga.
- That's it.
It's over.
- Exactly!
We should have guessed it.
They're going for full-out theatricality.
They know it's the easiest way to beat us.
Damn them!
What's up with this Gaga dude?
He just, like, dresses weird, right?
Like Bowie?
- [ Sighs ]
- Lady Gaga is a woman!
She's only the biggest pop act to come along in decades.
She's boundary-pushing.
The most theatrical performer of our generation.
She changes her look faster than Britt changes sexual partners.
- That's true.
- It makes sense that Vocal Adrenaline would pay homage.
- It's a brilliant move.
She's a perfect fit for them.
- Now, hold on a second.
We might be able to kill two birds with one stone here.
We can help Tina find a new look and find a competitive number for regionals.
This week, your assignment:
Gaga.
- [ All Gasping ]
- Pens.
Need pens.
My ideas just come to me.
- My office.
- I'm brainstorming.
- Oh, man!
And claw, claw, up, clap-clap!
And five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four-
- You think they can see us?
- If they catch us, are we gonna have to go to jail?
Stealing their ideas is not a crime.
Five, six, seven, eight, and one-
Your shoes are making noise.
Five, six, seven, eight.
- And one, two, three, four, five, six and seven, eight.
- They look amazing.
Claw, claw, up, clap-clap.
And five, six-[ Stammers ]
Okay, okay, okay.
It's just
- Enough.
You guys aren't getting it.
You're letting the costumes do all the work.
Theatricality isn't about crazy outfits.
It's not enough to douse yourselves with gasoline.
You have to light yourselves on fire to make it work!
God, she's good.
Being theatrical doesn't mean you have to be a nuclear explosion.
It can be like a quiet storm.
You just have to radiate emotion, express what's deep inside you.
That's what theatricality is truly about.
- Do I have to demonstrate?
" Funny Girl." E-flat.
- ** [Introduction ]
Exactly what I would have done.
Barbra.
I could do it in my sleep.
**[ Continues ]

Ms. Corcoran?
I'm Rachel Berry.
I'm your daughter.
Did you ever regret it?
Yes.
Then no.
Then so much.
But when did you realize it was the right time for me to find you?
[ Chuckles ] I saw you sing at sectionals.
You were extraordinary.
You were me.
[ Laughs ]
Was it hard for you to not become a star, to not have your dreams come true?
It felt like a broken promise.
Like the fisher king's wound- it never heals.
Wow.
Genetics really are amazing.
You see the world with the same fierce theatricality as I do.
Even the way we're sitting right now is so dramatic... and yet we feel so comfortable with it.
I've missed so much.
- How do you feel?
- Thirsty.
When I was little and I used to get sad... my dads would bring me a glass of water.
It got so I couldn't tell if I was sad or just thirsty.
Uh...
I shouldn't have done this.
This was supposed to feel good.
W-We were supposed to have some kind of slow-motion... run into each other's arms.
- This is all wrong.
- Maybe we can just g-go to dinner or something?
Just to get over the initial shock.
I'm so sorry, Rachel.
Uh-
I'll
- I'll call you.
Oh, hey, Finn.
Come on in.
I'm learning all this amazing stuff about Lady Gaga.
She's got this thing called the House of Gaga... this collective of artists and designers who collaborate on her styles, stage sets, music.
I think it's an exciting model for what we could be doing in Glee Club.
Yeah, that's kinda what I wanted to talk to you about.
I don't wanna do Lady Gaga.
And I suspect that, with the exception of Kurt... that none of the other guys are gonna want to do it either.
I just feel like we're always doing whatever the girls want us to do.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
You know, maybe I haven't been listening to you guys hard enough.
So let's find a solution.
Well, I, uh
- I actually already have one.
- [School Bell Rings ]
- You're wrong.
It's a good name.
It's a rock star name.
You want to name our daughter Jack Daniels?
She's a girl!
Okay, fine, whatever, Jackie Daniels.
The name is not the point!
I told you this.
I'm giving up the baby so I don't have to do this with you.
This is good for you.
Now you can go off and be a rock star yourself.
I love wearing champagne bubbles.
I get to express a whole different side of myself.
Even though I'm painfully shy and obsessed with death, I'm a really effervescent person.
- Excuse me!
Were you dropped on your heads?
- What was that?
I think you heard me.
I'm just saying, pick on me, that's fine.
- But don't throw around a girl.
- Lately we haven't been able to tell the difference.
We're not gaga for Gaga.
You dress all freaky... and then you rub it in everybody's faces.
I don't wanna look at it all day.
It's weird.
Makes my eyes tired.
You wanna switch it up a bit, just go from Gap to Banana Republic.
It's called being theatrical.
We're showing off who we are.
It's the same thing you do when you go to school with your football uniforms on.
You're expressing yourself, and we have every right to do the same.
Well, the next time you wanna express yourself and look like a circus freak... don't be shocked when my fist feels like expressing itself against your chin!
Okay?
I'll knock that crazy-fool crepe-paper nonsense off you.
- Let's go.
- You don't wanna be late for your appointment at Supercuts!
Watch your mouth, Hummel!
And you know what, fancy?
You don't need an appointment at Supercuts.
- They love walk-ins.
- [ Both Chuckling ]
- [ School Bell Rings ]
- Little monsters, take a bow.
[ Will Laughing] All right!
Ladies, Kurt, I am really, really impressed.
[ Will] Sientate.
You know what the best part is?
Each one of your costumes shows off a different aspect of your personalities.
Wait, where's Rachel?
I only notice because five minutes have gone by... without her saying something totally obnoxious.
Rachel kinda got some intense news yesterday.
We were spying on Vocal Adrenaline and-
Guys, that's not fair!
You gotta stop doing that.
But, uh, you know, wh- what'd you find out?
Okay, y'all ready?
Ms. Corcoran, their coach, she's Rachel's mom.
Are you serious?
- Way to bury the lead, Mercedes.
- We're screwed.
Rachel's gonna jump ship over to Vocal Adrenaline.
Never.
I really don't want to talk about it though.
I'm still processing the news.
And my dads are moving my therapist to our spare room later this afternoon.
A-A-All I know is that I 'm not going anywhere... and I've chosen a Lady Gaga look that expresses the longing for a childhood I was deprived of.
You look terrible.
I look awesome.
I think it's the Kermit the Frog look.
And we have a jumper.
[ Sighs ]
Well, my dads can't sew, so these are just stapled on.
Why don't we worry about this later and try to focus on the song.
Couldn't agree more.
Hit it.

- [ Cheering, Applause ]
- All right!
- [ Cheering, Applause ]
- All right!
-[ Toilet Flushing]
- Oh, God.
- What up, Finn?
- What's that on your face?
You got a bad pimple?
Yeah, a " Finn"-ple?
[ Laughs ]
- Oh, dude, are you wearing makeup?
- I knew it was contagious.
You moved in with that Kurt kid and now you got a bad case of the gays.
- It's just for Glee Club.
- Oh, that's definitely not gay, huh?
What up, man?
How many times do we gotta go through this?
You being a jock and being in this Glee Club does not make you versatile.
It makes you bisexual.
If we have to kick your ass to make you understand that, our schedules are wide open.
Get out of my bathroom.
You girls, y'all belong across the hallway.
- Glee boy!
- [ Laughing ]
** [ Disco ]
** [ Stops ]
Yeah, that's better, guys.
Take five.
And, ladies, I don't wanna hear about chafing... just because you're being forced to wear metal underwear- not my problem.
Mom?
[ Sighs ] Honey, you gotta stop sneaking into these rehearsals.
It's kind of important.
Oh, dear God.
My dads can't sew.
I really need a mom right now.
Do you think you can help?
- Sorry I'm late.
- Whoa!
- Sorry I'm late.
- Whoa!
- Looking good, Rachel!
- Thanks!
My mom made it.
[ Chattering, Laughing ]
Well, we're all here.
So without further ado I'd like to introduce the boys!
[ Puck] Lima, Ohio, get ready to rock!
[ Laughing, Screaming ]
[ Laughing, Screaming ]
*Well, the night's begun and you want some fun *
* Do you think you're gonna find it *
- *Think you're gonna find it * - [ Hooting, Yelling ]
* You gotta treat yourself like number one *
* Do you need to be reminded *
- * Need to be reminded *
- Whoo!
* It doesn't matter what you do or say*
*Just forget the things that you been told *
* We can't do it any other way *
* Everybody's gotta rock and roll *
* Ohh-ohh-whoo *
* Shout it, shout it *
* Shout it out loud *
* Shout it, shout it *
* Shout it out loud *
* If you don't feel good *
*There's a way you could *
* Don't sit there broken-hearted*
* Sit there broken-hearted *
* Call all your friends in the neighborhood *
* And get the party started *
* Get the party started *
* Don't let 'em tell you that there's too much noise *
* They're too old to really understand*
* You'll still get rowdy with the girls and boys *
* 'Cause it's time for you to take a stand *
* Yeah-eah-eah *
- Yeah!
- * Shout it, shout it *
* Shout it out loud *
*You got to have a party *
* Shout it, shout it *
* Shout it out loud *
*Turn it up louder *
* Shout it, shout it *
*Shout it out loud*
* Oh, yeah, yeah *
* Shout it, shout it *
* Shout it out loud *
* Hear it gettin' louder *
* Shout it, shout it Shout it out loud *
*Whoa **
[ Cheering, Yelling]
[ Cheering, Yelling]
All right, guys.
Very impressive.
Very, very...
Loud.
[ Laughs ]
But what does that performance express?
And what do those costumes illustrate?
We did our research, Mr. Schue.
Yeah, Finn's demon look is because Gene Simmons liked comic books as a kid... and they called Paul Stanley the Star Child because he was romantic or something.
But that doesn't really explain my whore lips.
And my Ace Frehley is supposed to be a spaceman from another planet.
Mike's iconic cat man was because Peter Criss claimed to have nine lives.
Yeah, and I'm dressed as the guy who replaced Artie when he quit.
Well, congratulations, guys.
-Job well done.
Let's give it up for the boys!
- [ Cheering, Yelling]
Whoo!
I thought the boys' KISS number was good... although the lyrics did leave something to be desired.
Finn kept sticking his tongue out, and I couldn't stop picturing him licking stuff.
It was disturbing.
We warned you.
Now Gaga's gotta go.
**[ Pop Ballad]
Could you have a word with Azimio and Karofsky about harassing me... without damaging my Gaga outfit?
Are you serious?
Do you know how difficult it is with those guys?
They already think we're boyfriends.
Let them think what they want.
They're Neanderthals.
In three years they'll be cleaning my septic tank.
Don't you get it?
It's not just them.
We live in Ohio, not New York or San Francisco or some other city... where people eat vegetables that aren't fried.
I don't understand why you always need to make such a big spectacle of yourself.
Why can't you just work harder at blending in?
I'm sure that'd be easier for you.
You know, it would.
You are such a boy.
You're gonna have to use a moist towelette if you wanna get that makeup off.
- Here, let me show you.
- Don't touch me!
What is your problem, Finn?
It's just a moist towelette!
I'm gonna finish in the laundry room.
Grow up, Finn!
- [School Bell Rings ]
- I know why you called, and don't worry about it.
My reconnection with Rachel is not some kind of plot to mess with you guys before regionals.
I'm not worried about regionals.
It's Rachel.
She's special.
She's got all of the best of you.
She's strong-willed, dramatic, wildly talented.
Go on.
But she's not hard like you.
She's fragile, overemotional... and she's convinced herself that you are as committed to this reunion as she is.
And I don't think you are.
You're not prepared to have a teenage daughter.
Are you?
I can't have any more kids.
There were issues a few years back... then some surgery, and that's that.
I really wanted a daughter.
That's why it was so important to me to make that bond with her.
But you're right.
I wanted my baby back.
Rachel's an adult now.
She doesn't need me.
Shelby, I can't tell you what to do... but if you really love her... you have to tell her what you just told me.
[ Kurt] I had to skip school to finish it, but I think you're really going to like it.
Consider it a peace offering after all the yelling that we've been doing.
I used Marlene Dietrich and Gary Cooper in Morocco as my inspiration.
I t's a perfect blend of the masculine and the feminine... the muted and the theatrical.
Are you freaking insane?
I can't live here.
I'm a dude.
What the hell is that supposed to be?
It's a privacy partition.
It's the only one I could find on such short notice.
Why are you getting angry about everything?
I worked hard on this.
That's not a privacy partition-
Why is it so hard for you to understand?
I don't want to get dressed in front of you.
I put my underwear on in the shower before I come out when you're around.
I don't wanna have to worry about that kind of stuff in my own room, man!
- And what "stuff' are you referring to?
- You know what I'm talking about.
Don't play dumb.
- Why can't you just accept that I'm not like you?
- I have accepted that.
No, you haven't.
You think I don't see the way you stare at me, how flirty you get?
You think I don't know why you got so excited that we were gonna be moving in together?
It's just a room, Finn!
- We can redecorate it if you want to!
- Okay.
Good!
Then the first thing that needs to go is that faggy lamp!
- And then we need to get rid of this faggy couch blanket-
- Hey!
What did you just call him?
Oh, n-n-no.
I didn't call him anything.
I was talking to the blanket.
- No, if you use that word, you're talking about him.
- Dad, I didn't take it that way.
Yeah, that's because you're 1 6 and you still assume the best in people.
You live a few years, you start seeing the hate in people's hearts.
Even the best people.
- You use the "N" word?
- Of course not.
How about "retard"?
You call that nice girl in Cheerios with Kurt-you call her a retard?
Becky?
N-No.
She's my friend.
She's got Down's Syndrome.
I'd never call her
- That's cruel.
But you think it's okay to come in my house and say "faggy"?
- But t-that's not what I meant.
- I know what you meant!
What, you think I didn't use that word when I was your age?
You know, some kid gets clocked in practice... we'd tell him stop bein' such a fag, shake it off!
.
We meant it exactly the way you meant it... that being gay is wrong, that it's some kind of punishable offense.
I really thought you were different, Finn.
You know, I thought that being in Glee Club... and being raised by your mom... meant that you were some, you know, new generation of dude... who saw things differently, who just kind of came into the world knowing... what its taken me years of struggling to figure out.
I guess I was wrong.
I'm sorry, Finn, but you can't- you can't stay here.
- Dad.
- I love your mom.
And maybe this is gonna cost me her... but my family comes first.
I can't have that kind of poison around.
This is our home, Kurt.
He is my son.
Out in the world you do what you want.
Not under my roof.
Place looks great.
[ Door Slams ]
- You look like you should be in orbit.
- My bubbles keep falling off.
I've been there.
- I wanna talk about this.
- There's not much to say.
I feel sorry for you.
I thought you were different.
I am different.
[ Will] All right, let's get things started.
Mr. Schue, I have something I want to say to Quinn... and I want everybody to hear it.
All right.
[ Exhales, Stammers ]
At first I didn't get this theatrical assignment... being larger than life and putting it all out there, 'cause I'm like that all the time.
That's how my dad was too.
He was too busy being all crazy and rock and roll... to be there for his kid.
And you know what?
I didn't care that my dad was a bad-ass.
I just wanted him to be there, and he never was.
Then I learned all this KISS stuff and... while Jackie Daniels is a great name for a power boat or something... it's not right for a baby girl.
So if my KISS-mates will help me out, I got a better idea.
Grab a stool, guys.
** [ Ballad ]

* But I can't come home right now *

I know you're giving her up, but... before you do...
I think you should name her Beth.
If you'll let me, I'd really like to be there when she's born.
I'd really like to meet her.
[School Bell Rings ]
[ Sighs ]
How'd your dads come up with the name Rachel?
They were big Friends fans.
I know why you're here.
To say good-bye.
I really wanted this to work.
Do you know what really turned me?
That story you told me about your dads and how they'd bring you water when you were sad.
We're never gonna have anything like that.
It's too late for us.
I just think that anything we share right now is gonna be confusing for you.
I just don't understand.
You're my mom.
I feel awful right now, and I should want to just fall into your arms... and let you rock me and tell me everything is gonna be fine, but...
I just don't feel it.
It's because I'm your mother, but I'm not your mom.
So, what, do we just pretend we don't know each other now?
That seems silly.
Let's just be grateful for one another... from afar for a while.
Don't think for a second I'm gonna go soft on you during regionals.
[ Sniffles ] Bring it.
[ Laughs ]
Can I have a hug good-bye?
Sure.
[ Chuckles ]
Can you do me one more favor?
Sometime when you're thirsty... can you get yourself some water from this cup?
Gold stars are kinda my thing.
Of course.
Shelby.
Before you go, will- will you sing with me?
Just one time?
It's sort of a fantasy of mine, and it would really mean a lot to me.
I would be honored.
Brad.
He's always just around.
Um-
There you go.

- Whoa!
Guys, why are you all in your theatricality costumes?
It's the end of the week.
We were kind of hoping to learn what the lesson of the assignment was.
Well, you guys have had some great numbers this week, but I'm not sure I know either.
- [ All Laughing ]
- I do.
I refuse to dress like somebody I'm not to be somebody I'm not.
And I learned it's good to be a little theatrical.
- [ Gasps ]
- So here's what's gonna happen.
My dad, he's the king of the vampires... and Asian vampires are the most vicious of all the vampires.
You're going to let me wear my lady demon clothes... or my dad will fly into your bedroom and bite your face off.
He's really pissed.
Is that what you want?
No, I don't want that, I 'm afraid.
Good.
I'm glad we had this talk.
Now I have to go back to my coffin because the light is burning my eyes!
- There she is.
- [Applause ]
She's back!
She's back!
- Wait, where's Kurt?
- Where's Finn?
Fine.
You wanna hit me?
You wanna beat me up?
Go ahead.
But I swear to you I will never change.
I'm proud to be different.
It's the best thing about me.
So go ahead.
Hit me.
I believe I will.
Sir, would you like to go first?
You're not hitting anyone.
- Oh, my God.
- Is he wearing a red rubber dress, or am I trippin'?
I wanna thank you, Kurt.
I realize I still have a lot to learn.
But the reason I'm here right now in a shower curtain is... because of you.
- And I'm not gonna let anyone lay a hand on you.
- Oh.
Really, dude?
'Cause I'm pretty sure we can take both of you.
Yeah, but can you take all of us?
Okay.
Okay, I get it.
I took biology.
You know what?
We done disturbed the freak hive.
The worker freaks is tryin' to protect the queen freak.
Next time we'll bring some friends too.
I'm tired of everyone calling us freaks.
[ Laughing ] Well, look at us.
We are freaks.
[ All Laughing ]
But we're all freaks together... and we shouldn't have to hide it.
[Applause ]
Nice job, Finn.
Think you just figured out what the lesson was.
Kinda makes me wish I'd planned it.
But Mercedes is right.
You do all look incredibly insane.
- [ All ] Thank you.
- You're so welcome.
Anyways, let's get back to work... before you're all forced to join the circus.
Next stop, regionals!

Finn's mom's dating Kurt's dad, which was totally part of
Kurt's plan to get closer to Finn,
When will you learn that nothing is impossible when it comes to love?
Artie told Tina what his greatest dream was, then realized that not every dream is achievable.
Is that even a word-- achievable?
Achievatate?
Achievalize?
Okay, you just said, like, ten offensive things.
Jessie pushed Rachel to find out who her mom was, and it turns out it's Shelby Corcoran, the coach of Vocal Adrenaline.
I want a look that's so optimistic, it could cure cancer.
Geez.
And that's what you missed on Glee.
Am I in trouble?
Come on.
You've got more self-esteem than that.
I think this might have something to do with your perfect attendance last semester.
No.
Miss Cohen-Chang is in trouble.
It has come to my attention that the look you sport is what is known as goth.
American teens are coming down with a serious case of Twilight fever, transformed from normal children into vampires obsessed with the occult.
And only yesterday, this dark specter reared its head at McKinley High.
This is totally going to get Robert Pattinson's attention.
Oh, hey.
{girls roaring}
{all screaming} Oh, dear God!
I don't mean to state the obvious, but you do know that vampires aren't real, right?
They don't exist.
William, denial will not make this problem go away!
My parents won't even let me watch Twilight.
My mom says she thinks Kristin Stewart seems like a bitch.
This is a serious problem!
Miss Cohen-Chang, you've got to find yourself another style of dress!
Hold on a second.
Tina is shy, and one way she's found to express herself is through her clothes.
High school is an incredibly important time when kids get to explore who they are.
When I was in high school, I had a whole year where I dressed exactly like Kurt Cobain.
I mean, come on.
There has to be someone who you used to dress like.
Yes.
For several years in my early 20s,
I dressed up as Elvis.
But he was a Christian, Will!
And he did not possess the ability to transform into a bat!
:
I think he thinks vampires are real.
I think you're right.
Studies have shown that a strict dress code fosters a safe and stable learning environment with fewer instances of gang violence and vampirism.
So, if I see you dressed in lacy demon clothes again,
Tina Cohen-Chang, {pounds desk}
You will be suspended!
Step.
Couple more.
Is there a car down here from me?
Honey, we're indoors.
Oh.
Okay.
And open your eyes.
Sparkling cider?
Yeah.
"Welcome home"?
But who went somewhere?
Burt asked us to move in with them.
And this is how you're telling me?
The party is my idea.
If you're gonna say something, say it loud, right?
BURT:
Yeah.
It's gonna take some getting used to, but trust me, you're gonna love it, okay?
Now you don't have to drag your tail over here every time you want to watch something on the old 55-incher.
We got a lot of food-- some ethnic food.
It's some ethnicity that's not ours.
Tuna cruditÃ©s.
Tuna cruditÃ©s.
It's not ethnic.
Here you go.
CAROLE:
Finn, this house is twice as big as ours.
It has two bathrooms.
Two and a half.
I don't want an extra bathroom or a tuna crude.
I just want my house back.
I think I know what this resistance is about.
Our room.
And I couldn't agree more.
The palate in here is totally unflattering to your skin tone.
Not everyone can pull off Dior gray.
We need to redecorate.
Wait, we're sharing a room?
I'm not cool with that!
CAROLE:
Baby, I know it's weird, okay?
But can't be much of a surprise.
And, in time, you're gonna be as happy as I am.
Yeah, look, I'll knock out a wall upstairs,
I'll put an addition on, okay?
But-but until then, maybe this will grease the wheels a bit, huh?
Oh.
Hey.
Look, that's 300.
Oh, my...
Have at it.
You redecorate this place.
Don't worry, roomie.
Mr. Ikea Catalog and I will have this all figured out.
I am going to put together a palate that expresses who you are and who I want you to be.
Who you want to be.
Hey, what night's game night?
You play Sorry?
You know...
He will now.
I will...
:
Sorry.
I will beat you.
It's so weird.
This so isn't you.
I feel like an Asian Branch Davidian.
Tina, are there any other looks you can try?
Biker chick?
Cowgirl?
Hood rat.
Computer programmer.
Cross-country skier.
Catholic schoolgirl.
Happy Meal, no onions.
Or a chicken.
Look, I appreciate it, guys, but it just isn't me.
I know who I am, and I'm not allowed to show it.
It's like communism.
Guys, we have a serious problem.
You know how I've been doing some deep background on Vocal Adrenaline?
Isn't that against the rules?
No, not at all.
Or probably.
Whatever!
Anyway, what I figured out;
I rooted through the Dumpsters behind the Carmel auditorium and I found 18 empty boxes of Christmas lights.
Oh, no.
Which led me to Joelle Fabrics.
I asked them about red Chantilly lace.
They were sold out.
Oh, sweet Jesus.
Oh, my.
Wait, what?
- They're doing Gaga.
- That's it.
It's over.
Exactly.
We should have guessed it.
They're going for full-out theatricality.
They know it's the easiest way to beat us.
Damn them.
What's up with this Gaga dude?
He just, like, dresses weird, right?
Like Bowie?
Lady Gaga is a woman.
She's only the biggest pop act to come along in decades.
She's boundary-pushing, the most theatrical performer of our generation.
And she changes her look faster than Brit changes sexual partners.
That's true.
ARTIE:
It makes sense that
Vocal Adrenaline would pay homage.
It's a brilliant move.
She's a perfect fit for them.
Hold on a second.
We might be able to kill two birds with one stone here.
We can help Tina find a new look and nd a competitive number for regionals.
This week, your assignment:
Gaga.
{gasping, murmuring} RACHEL:
Pens, we need pens.
My ideas just come to me.
Uh, my office.
Right there.
I'm brainstorming.
It's coming.
And claw, claw, uh, clap, clap.
And five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four...
Think they can see us?
:
If they catch us, are we gonna have to go to jail?
Stealing their ideas is not a crime.
SHELBY:
...six, seven, eight.
And one, two...
Your shoes are making noise.
...and five, six, seven, eight.
And one, two, three, four, five, six and seven...
They look amazing.
Claw, claw, uh, clap, clap.
And five, six-- uh, uh...
Okay, okay, okay, just... enough.
You guys aren't getting it.
Your letting the costumes do all the work.
Theatricality isn't about crazy outfits.
It's not enough to douse yourselves with gasoline.
You have to light yourselves on fire to make it work.
God, she's good.
But being theatrical doesn't mean you have to be a nuclear explosion.
It can be like, like a quiet storm.
You just have to radiate emotion, express what's deep inside you.
That's what theatricality is truly about.
Do I have to demonstrate?
"Funny Girl," E flat.
# Barbra Streisand's "Funny Girl" #
Exactly what I would have done:
Barbra.
I could do it in my sleep.
¶¶Funny¶¶
¶¶Did you hear that?
¶¶
¶¶Funny¶¶
¶¶Yeah, the guy said, "Honey¶¶
¶¶You're a funny girl"¶¶
¶¶That's me¶¶
¶¶I just keep them in stitches¶¶
¶¶Doubled in half¶¶
¶¶And though I may be¶¶
¶¶All wrong for the guy¶¶
¶¶I'm good for a laugh¶¶
¶¶I guess it's not funny¶¶
¶¶Life is far from sunny¶¶

Ms. Corcoran?
I'm Rachel Berry, I'm your daughter.
Did you ever regret it?
Yes.
Then no.
Then so much.
W-When did you realize it was the right time for me to find you?
I saw you sing at sectionals.
You were extraordinary.
You were me.
Was it hard for you to not become a star?
To not have your dreams come true?
It felt like a broken promise.
Like the Fisher King's wound-- never heals.
Wow.
Genetics really are amazing.
You see the world with the same fierce theatricality as I do.
Even the way we're sitting right now is so dramatic, and yet we feel so comfortable with it.
I've missed so much.
How do you feel?
Thirsty.
When I was little and I used to get sad, my dads would bring me a glass of water.
It got so I couldn't tell if I was sad or just thirsty.
I shouldn't have done this.
This was supposed to feel good.
W-We were supposed to have some kind of slow-motion run into each other's arms.
This is all wrong.
Maybe we can just go to dinner or something just to get over the initial shock.
I'm so sorry, Rachel.
Uh...
I'll...
I'll call you.
Oh, hey, Finn, come on in.
I'm learning all this amazing stuff about Lady Gaga.
She's got this thing called the "Haus of Gaga," which is like, this collective of artists and designers who collaborate on, on her styles and stage sets and her music.
I think it's an exciting model for what we could be doing in Glee Club.
Yeah, that's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about.
I don't want to do Lady Gaga.
And I suspect that...
with the exception of Kurt... that none of the other guys are gonna want to do it either.
I just feel like we're always doing whatever the girls want us to do.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
Maybe I haven't been listening to you guys hard enough.
So let's find a solution.
Well, I, uh, I actually already have one.
You're wrong.
It's a really good name.
It's a rock star name.
You want to name our daughter "Jack Daniels"?
She's a girl!
Okay, fine, whatever.
Jackie Daniels.
The name is not the point.
I told you this.
I'm giving up the baby so I don't have to do this with you.
This is good for you.
Now you can go off and be a rock star yourself.
I love wearing champagne bubbles!
I get to express a whole different side of myself!
Because even though I'm painfully shy and obsessed with death, I'm a really effervescent person.
Excuse me!
Were you dropped on your heads?
!
What was that?
I think you heard me.
I'm just saying.
Pick on me-- that's fine-- but don't throw around a girl.
Well, you know, lately, we haven't been able to tell the difference.
We're not gaga for Gaga.
You dress all freaky, and then you rub it in everybody's faces.
I don't want to look at it all day!
It's weird.
It makes my eyes tired.
If you want to switch it up a bit, just go from Gap to Banana Republic.
It's called being theatrical.
We're showing off who you are.
It's the same thing you do when you go to school with your football uniforms on.
You're expressing yourself, and we have every right to do the same.
Well, you know what?
The next time you want to express yourself a little like a circus freak, don't be shocked when my fist feels like expressing itself against your chin!
Okay?
Knock that crazy fool crepe-paper nonsense offa you.
Let's go.
Yeah, you don't want to be late for your appointment at Supercuts!
Watch your mouth, homo!
And you know what, fancy?
You don't need an appointment at Supercuts.
They love walk-ins.
- {both chortle} - {school bell rings}
Little monsters, take a bow.
{Will laughs, applause}
All right!
Ladies, Kurt, I am really, really impressed.
Sientete.
You know, you know what the best part is?
Each one of those costumes shows off a different aspect of your personalities.
Wait.
Where's Rachel?
I mean, I only noticed because, like, five minutes have gone by without her saying something totally obnoxious.
Rachel kinda got some intense news yesterday.
We were spying on Vocal Adrenaline, and...
You guys, that's not fair!
You gotta stop doing that.
But, uh, you know, what, what'd you find out?
- Okay, y'all ready?
- Miss Corcoran, their coach?
She's Richel's mom.
Are you serious?
Way to bury the lead, Mercedes.
PUCK:
We're screwed.
Rachel's gonna jump ship over to Vocal Adrenaline.
Never.
I really don't want to talk about it, though.
I'm still processing the news.
And my dads are moving my therapist to our spare room later this afternoon.
All I can know is that I'm not going anywhere, and I've chosen a Lady Gaga look that expresses the longing for a childhood
I was deprived of.
You look terrible.
I look awesome.
I think it's the Kermit-the-Frog look.
KURT:
And we have a jumper.
Well, my dads can't sew, so these are just stapled on.
Guys, why don't we worry about this later, and maybe try to focus on the song?
Couldn't agree more.
Hit it!

What up, Finn?
What's that on your face?
You got a bad pimple or something?
A Finn-ple?
{both laugh}
Dude, are you wearing makeup?
I knew it was contagious.
You moved in with that little Kurt kid, and now you got a bad case of the gay.
It's just something for Glee Club, all right?
Oh, well, then it's definitely not gay, huh?
Get out of my way!
Man, how many times do we got go through this?
!
You being a jock and being in this Glee Club does not make you versatile.
It makes you bisexual.
And if we have to kick your ass to make you understand that, then our schedules are wide open.
Get out of my bathroom.
You girls, y'all belong across the hallway.
Glee boy!
{Karofsky laughs}
{dance music playing}
{music stops}
Yeah, that's better, guys.
Take five.
And, ladies, I don't want to hear about chafing just because you're being forced to wear metal underwear.
Not my problem.
Mom?
Hon, you gotta stop sneaking into these rehearsals.
It's kind of important.
Oh, dear God.
My dads can't sew.
I really need a mom right now.
Do you think you can help?
Sorry I'm late.
Whoa, looking good, Rachel!
Thanks.
My mom made it.
Very nice.
{Mercedes laughs}
Well, we're all here, so without further ado,
I'd like to introduce The Boys!
ARTIE:
Lima, Ohio, get ready to rock!

¶¶
{song ends}
{girls cheering}
All right, guys, very impressive.
Very, very...
loud.
But what, uh, what does that performance express?
And what do those costumes illustrate?
We did our research, Mr. Shue.
Yeah, Finn's demon look is because Gene Simmons liked comic books as a kid, and they called Paul Stanley the "Star Child"
because he was a romantic or something.
But that doesn't really explain my whore lips.
And my Ace Frehley is supposed to be a spaceman from another planet.
Mike's iconic catman is because Peter Criss claimed to have nine lives.
Yeah, And I'm dressed as the guy who replaced Artie when he quit.
Well, congratulations, guys.
Job well done.
Let's give it up for the boys!
I thought the boys' KISS number was good, although the lyrics did leave something to be desired.
And Finn kept sticking his tongue out and I couldn't stop picturing him licking stuff.
It was disturbing.
We warned you.
Now Gaga's got to go.
Could you have a word with Azimio and Karofsky about harassing me without damaging my Gaga outfit?
Are you serious?
Do you know how difficult it is with those guys?
They already think we're boyfriends.
Let them think what they want.
They're Neanderthals.
In three years, they'll be cleaning my septic tank.
Don't you get it?
It's not just them.
We live in Ohio-- not New York or San Francisco or some other city where people eat vegetables that aren't fried.
I don't understand why you always need to make such a big spectacle of yourself.
Why can't you just work harder at blending in?
I'm sure that'd be easier for you.
You know, it would.
You are such a boy.
You're going to have to use a moist towelette if you want to get that makeup off.
Don't touch me!
What is your problem, Finn?
It's just a moist towelette!
I'm gonna finish in the laundry room.
Grow up, Finn!
I know why you called, and don't worry about it.
My reconnection with Rachel is not some kind of plot to mess with you guys before regionals.
I'm not worried about regionals.
It's Rachel.
She's special.
She's got all of the best of you.
She's strong-willed, dramatic, wildly talented.
Go on.
But she's not hard like you.
She's fragile.
over-emotional.
And she's clearly convinced herself that you are as committed to this reunion as she is.
And I don't think you are.
You're not prepared to have a teenage daughter.
Are you?
I can't have any more kids.
There were issues a few years back.
Then some surgery, and that's that.
I really wanted a daughter.
That's why it was so important to me to make that bond with her.
But you're right.
I wanted my baby back.
Rachel's an adult now.
She doesn't need me.
Shelby,
I can't tell you what to do...
But if you really love her, you have to tell her what you just told me.
KURT:
I had to skip school to finish it, but I think you're really going to like it.
Consider it a peace offering after all the yelling that we've been doing.
I used Marlene Dietrich and Gary Cooper in Morocco as my inspiration.
It's a perfect blend of the masculine and the feminine, the muted and the theatrical.
Are you freaking insane?
I can't live here.
I'm a dude.
What the hell is that supposed to be?
It's a privacy partition
It's all I could find on such short notice.
Why are you getting angry about everything?
I worked hard on thi
That's not a privacy partition!
Why is it so hard for you to understand?
I don't want to get dressed in front of you!
Do you know that
I put my underwear on in the shower before I come out when you're around?
I just...
I don't want to have to worry about that kind of stuff in my own room, man.
And what stuff are you referring to?
You know.
You know what I'm talking about.
Don't play dumb.
Why can't you just accept that I'm not like you?
I have accepted that.
No, you haven't.
You think I don't see the way you stare at me?
How flirty you get.
You think I don't know why you got so excited that we were going to be moving in together?
It's just a room, Finn!
We can redecorate it if you want to!
Okay, good.
Well, then the first thing that needs to go is that faggy lamp.
And then we need to get rid of this faggy couch cover...
Hey!
What did you just call him?
Oh, no, no, I didn't call him anything.
I was talking to the blanket.
If you use that word, you're talking about him.
Relax, Dad.
I didn't take it that way.
Yeah, that's because you're 16 and you still assume the best in people.
You live a few years, you start seeing the hate in people's hearts.
Even the best people.
You use the "N" word?
Of course not.
How about "retard"?
You call that nice girl in Cheerios!
with Kurt, you call her a retard?
Becky-- no.
She's my friend.
She's got Down syndrome.
I'd never call her that.
That's cruel.
But you think it's okay to come into my house and say "faggy"?
That's not what I meant...
I know what you meant!
What, you think I didn't use that word when I was your age?
You know, some kid gets clocked in practice, we'd tell him to stop being such a fag.
Shake it off.
We meant it exactly the way you meant it.
That being gay is wrong.
That it's some kind of punishable offense.
I really thought you were different, Finn.
You know, I thought that being in Glee Club and being raised by your mom meant that you were some, you know, new generation of dude who saw things differently.
Who just kind of, you know, came into the world knowing what has taken me years of struggling to figure out.
I guess I was wrong.
I'm sorry, Finn, but you can't... you can't stay here.
Dad.
I love your mom.
And maybe this is going to cost me her, but my family comes first.
I can't have that kind of poison around.
This is our home, Kurt.
He is my son.
Out in the world, you do what you want, but not under my roof.
The place looks great.
- You should be in orbit.
- My balls keep fallinoff.
Been there.
I want to talk about this.
There's not much to say.
I feel sorry for you.
I thought you were different.
I am different.
WILL:
All right, let's get things started.
Mr. Shue.
There's something I want to say to Quinn.
And I want everybody to hear it.
All right.
At first I didn't really get this theatrical assignment, being larger than life and putting it all out there, 'cause I'm kind of like that all the time.
That's how my dad was, too.
He was too busy being all crazy and rock and roll to be there for his kid.
And you know what?
I didn't care that my dad was a badass.
I just wanted him to be there.
And he never was.
And then I learned all this KISS stuff and while Jackie Daniels is a great name for like a powerboat or something, it's not right for a baby girl.
So if my KISS mates will help me out, I got a better idea.
Grab a stool, guys.
{KISS' "Beth" intro playing}
¶¶Beth, I hear you calling¶¶
¶¶But I can't come home right now¶¶
¶¶Me and the boys are playing¶¶
¶¶And we just can't find the sound¶¶
¶¶Just a few more hours¶¶
¶¶And I'll be right home to you¶¶
¶¶I think I hear them calling¶¶
¶¶Oh, Beth, what can I do?
¶¶
¶¶Beth, what can I do?
¶¶
¶¶You say you feel so empty¶¶
¶¶That our house just ain't our home¶¶
¶¶I'm always somewhere else¶¶
¶¶And you're always there alone¶¶
¶¶Just a few more hours¶¶
¶¶And I'll be right home to you¶¶
¶¶I think I hear them calling¶¶
¶¶Oh, Beth, what can I do?
¶¶
¶¶Beth, what can I do?
¶¶
¶¶Beth, I know you're lonely¶¶
¶¶And I hope you'll be all right¶¶
¶¶'Cause me and the boys will be playing all night¶¶
¶¶All night.¶¶
I know you're giving her up, but before you do, I think you should name her Beth.
If you'll let me,
I'd really like to be there when she's born.
I'd really like to meet her.
So, how'd your dads come up with the name "Rachel"?
They were, um, big Friends fans.
I know why you're here... to say good-bye.
I really wanted this to work.
Do you know what really turned me?
That story that you told me about your dads, and how they'd bring you water when you were sad.
We're never gonna have anything like that.
It's too late for us.
I just think that anything we share right now is gonna be confusing for you.
I just don't understand.
You're my mom.
I feel awful right now, and I should want to just fall into your arms and let you rock me and tell me everything is gonna be fine, but...
I just don't feel it.
It's because I'm your mother, but I'm not your mom.
So what?
Do we just pretend we don't know each other now?
That seems silly.
Let's just be grateful for one another... from afar.
For a while.
Don't think for a second I'm gonna go soft on you during regionals.
Bring it.
Can I have a hug good-bye?
Sure.
Can you do me one more favor?
Sometime when you're thirsty... can you get yourself some water from this cup?
Gold stars are kinda my thing.
Of course.
Shelby... before you go, will... will you sing with me?
Just one time.
It's sort of a fantasy of mine, and it would really mean a lot to me.
I would be honored.
Brad!
He's always just around.
Um, take that.
Here you go.

You are really, really good.
{school bell ringing} Whoa!
Guys, why are you all in your theatricality costumes?
It's the end of the week.
We were kinda hoping to learn what the lesson of the assignment was.
Well, um... you guys have had some great numbers this week, but I'm not totally sure that I know either.
{all laugh}
I do.
I refuse to dress like somebody I'm not to be somebody I'm not.
And I learned it's good to be a little theatrical.
So here's what's going to happen.
My dad-- he's the king of the vampires.
And Asian vampires are the most vicious of all the vampires.
You're going to let me wear my lady demon clothes, or my dad will fly into your bedroom and bite your face off.
He's really pissed.
Is that what you want?
No, I don't want that.
I'm afraid.
Good.
I'm glad we had this talk.
Now I have to go back to my coffin because the light is burning my eyes!
There she is.
{all cheering}
Wait.
Where's Kurt?
Where's Finn?
Fine.
You want to hit me?
You want to beat me up?
Go ahead.
But I swear to you I will never change.
I'm proud to be different.
It's the best thing about me.
So go ahead, hit me.
I believe I will.
Sir, would you like to go first?
FINN:
You're not hitting anyone.
Oh, my God.
Is he wearing a red rubber dress or am I trippin'?
I want to thank you, Kurt.
I realize I still have a lot to learn, but the reason I'm here right now... in a shower curtain, is... because of you.
And I'm not going to let anyone lay a hand on you.
Oh, really, dude?
'Cause I'm pretty sure we can take both of you.
PUCK:
Yeah?
But can you take all of us?
AZIMIO:
Okay.
Okay, I get it.
I took biology.
You know what, Karofsky?
We done disturbed the freak hive.
The worker freaks is trying to protect the queen freak.
Next time... we'll bring some friends, too.
I'm tired of everyone calling us freaks.
Welllook at us.
We are freaks.
{all laugh}
But we're all freaks together.
And we shouldn't have to hide it.
{Will clapping}
Nice job, Finn.
I think you just figured out what the lesson was.
Kinda makes me wish I had planned it.
But Mercedes is right, You do all look incredibly insane.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're so welcome.
WILL:
Anyways, let's get back to work before you're all forced to join the circus.
Next stop?
Regionals.
Great shirt alert.
Yeah?
No.
I just made up that phrase "great shirt alert,"
and it's reay fun to say. (Chuckles) Oh, well, you should have said it to Andy.
I mean, come on.
Great shirt alert.
Yeah?
No.
I just wanted to try saying it.
Jules, you're rht.
It's so fun!
I have had the worst writer's block.
This is the only song
I've been able to come up with in the last three weeks.
♪ writer's block, writer's block, writer's ♪
♪ writer's, writer's, writer's, block, block, block, block ♪
(hammering and sawing) Hear that?
That's what your stupid songs sound like in my head!
Why do we still have to hang out here when your bathroom's being remodeled?
My kitchen is our hangout.
It's--it's our turf.
It's our clubhouse.
Our... (Rolls tongue) Barrio.
Why did you teach her how to roll her r's?
Molly... (Rolls tongue) Ringwald.
I'm really sorry.
Oh, come on.
The construction's not that bad.
You know, we got to meet Gerald.
This has been a great couple of weeks.
You guys really got me through some stuff.
We know yo father's a tough cookie.
But just remember, all that yelling is just him showing you his love, you know?
I do now.
Who lays tile better than you?
No one.
I can do this.
He's back.
You go, Gerald!
Yeah, yeah!
You dad was wrong about you!
His dad was not wrong, but you do what you do for good tile, you know?
Oh, I can't wait for this bathroom to be done!
In fact, put it in your calendars, because I'm gonna have a bathroom-warming party.
Can I bring Sara to what sounds like the worst party ever?
Ooh, you mean Sara, your new girlfriend?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
(Scoffs)
Oh, that was embarrassing.
I-I thought you were all gonna do it.
Hey, where did you even find the space to put in a giant master bathroom?
Balls!
I love you.
Not happening.
What do you mean, "not happening"?
I'm not allowed to love you?
That "I love you" doesn't mean "I love you."
It means "let's have sex.
" It doesn't this time.
Trust me.
I can be quick.
You broke the trust!
Look, our sex schedule is one and a half times a week.
It has been ten days since our one or our half.
Our half?
Come on.
It's your half.
Yeah, it is.
I admit, it's be too long, but I got sidelined by that u.
T.I. All right, react.
(Mutters, coughs)
But now you want sex so badly that it's too much pressure.
It makes me not want it.
So you want me to not want it?
No, I want you to want it, but I don't want to know you want it.
How will you know I want it?
If I want it, you'll want it.
True.
Okay.
We can do this.
Okay.
All right.
Just give me my half!
(Camera shutter clicks) Y, thanks for doing this.
I can't believe your school makes you do photo projects.
It's like they cater to the weird, artsy-fartsy kids.
I started the photography club.
Cool.
Nice save.
All right, now this is... (Mouths word)
All about stolen moments.
So you just gotta pretend like I'm not here.
Just do it, nerd.
Hurtful.
Okay, one, two, three.
(Woman) ♪ Ahh ♪
♪ hot stuff ♪
♪ you superstar ♪ seriously?
If there's a camera around, we bring the sexy.
It's how we do.
Well, the camera would beg to differ.
(Laurie gasps)
It's a devil camera!
I'm a seal.
No posing, okay?
Just go sit on the bench and talk.
(Camera shutter clicking) Oh, I know.
Why don't we play that game where we guess who's gonna die first?
Laurie.
Laurie.
You get defibrillated at a kid rock concert one time...
Well... how do you feel about Grayson being in a real relationship?
I don't know.
And I can't really be jealous because I never got in the game.
But honestly, it--it does kinda suck.
(Camera shutter clicks) Sha-boom.
A moment has been stolen.
Travis, let me see that.
I was sad.
That's not fair.
Ooh.
Whoa.
I look hot when I'm depressed.
Oh!
That's why I always get hit on when I'm at funerals.
Uh-huh.
Aw, why can't someone die?
Stop it.
You're Jules, right?
I'm Sara.
Oh.
Hi.
You're- you're Grayson's, uh-
- I am.
(Chuckles) Have a seat.
Well, I'm just gonna dive right in.
You've got gorgeous hair.
It's like you hit your head on a rock, and honey is pouring out.
I ju had it done for your bathroom party.
Twice.
Oh, I forgot.
You don't know me.
(Singsongy) I'm insane!
No way!
Me, too.
(Laughs) Hey, don't be nervous about tonight, okay?
'Cause it's totally casual.
I mean, don't wear jeans, 'cause we're not animals. (Chuckles) Okay, thanks.
Oh, I gotta run.
You know, you're as cool as Grayson said.
Oh.
Peace.
Peace?
What kind of a skank wears a watch?
Nice try, Laurie, but I like her.
(Laughs)
Oh, you're serious.
Yeah.
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?
Mm!
(Travis) Oh.
Oh.
She let you kiss her that way?
Yeah, dad.
I lick her mouth.
Mmm!
Sha-bammy!
(Scoffs) I'm making out with a dog.
Delete that.
Fine.
(Grunts) You might want to take some notes, junior.
Dog Travis has more game than you.
Look, I got it covered, all right?
(Laughs) Travis!
You just undid my bra!
Seriously?
I've got got heated floors, a steam shower, flat screen, and check out the tub.
It is so deep I can rent it out for water births.
(Laurie) Wow, Jules!
It's like a bathroom from a fairy tale!
I can totally picture a princess copping a squat in here.
We're in a bathroom.
Is that one of those electronic toilet seats from Japan?
Mm-hmm.
Holy gods, it cleans your hoo.
There are a lot more settings to figure out.
You know, there's one button that just says "no." Oh.
Oh, I can't wait to push that.
I'll bet.
The only downside is that sometimes it yells at me in Japanese.
Mm.
Wow.
Brace yourselves.
Grayson's on his way up with Sara.
Oh, here we go.
What?
Is he being more of a cocky jerk now that he has a girlfriend?
No, sort of the opposite.
Sorry we're late.
Yeah, my little sare-bear's tummy was growling... (Baby voice) So we got a wittle num-num.
A wittle num-num-num-num-num.
Oh, no. (Normal voice) Here.
Let me take your purse. (Grunts)
What do you got in there, rocks?
Oh.
I'm kidding, you.
Sha-moo.
(Camera shutter clicks)
(Electronic male voice) Furasshu!
(Flusheu)
Oh, that means "flush." Yay!
Oh. hey, sorry.
I'd love to stay, but the old ball and chain...
I'm kidding.
Bye, guys.
Bye!
See ya!
(Laurie) We'll miss you!
(Laughs)
Oh, no!
Oh, my lord!
Downright painful.
Did you see Grayson just standing there, holding Sara's purse?
I've got one better than " great shirt alert."
Grayson is totally pursey-whipped.
(Laughs) That's good.
That is really gonna catcon.
Pursey magnet.
Pursey hound.
Pursey cat.
That's not how it works.
Maybe Grayson's just being careful because--
I'm sorry.
I just- I-I really miss my bathroom.
Ahh.
Yes.
Continue.
Maybe Grayson's just being careful because it's a new relationship.
They probably haven't even shaved each other yet.
I never t this whole Grayson thing, but now seeing him all weak and submissive, it's oh, so hot.
Come on.
I think it makes him so unattractive.
Yeah.
It's a total...
(Makes whooshing sound)
What?
It's the universal sign for lady turnoff.
No, it's--it's not.
He's just gonna push Sara away.
Wouldn't that make you happy?
I don't wanna watch a friend drown.
Plus, I-I like Sara.
She was so nice to me this morning when I ran into her.
(Crying) I'm sorry I'm crying.
Your hair's so much nicer than mine.
I know.
Everything is.
That never happened.
That's how I remember it.
Why are you so into photography?
I feel like photos really capture our collective unconscious.
Plus, being pretentious really works on me.
You should work that angle in college.
Get yourself a scarf and watch the nerdy girls start throwing their legs open.
Yeah, I love Kylie.
I an, even though we're going to different colleges,
I think we're gonna stay together.
(Both laugh)
Are you done?
(Both) No. (Laughing)
Oh!
I really dig this one of Kylie kissing the dog.
Looks like an old portuguese man and his mistress.
She won't let me use it, though.
I had to pretend I deleted it.
Art should never be compromised for the sake of vanity. (Jules) Laurie, bring up coffee.
We're working in my bathroom today.
She slept in there last night.
Honey, you have a problem.
I don't have a problem.
Are you planning on leaving the bathroom today?
No, no, no.
Not--not today.
So Ellie pulled the whole to-get-sex-more- you-have-to-want-it-less thing?
(Laughs) Classic.
I can't handle it, man.
I'm not strong enough.
Calm down, a-team.
You calm down!
Look, what you need to do is just picture Ellie with a bucket head.
A bucket on her head?
No, the bucket is her head.
How would that help?
Have you ever looked side of a bucket and not seen something disgusting?
Fish guts, dip, spit, dead rats.
That'll work.
Sorry I yelled.
And not seen something diapology hug.
(Grunts)
Ellie thinks our apology hugs are weird.
She's weird. (Grunts)
Apology accepted.
Still having writer's block?
♪ trying to break it by singing every word I say ♪

Damn it!
I just got perfume all over my contracts.
That's it.

Good day.
So... ♪ why did you have me over?
♪ I grabbed one of Travis' cameras, because I wanted to show you some of the pictures that he's been taking of you and Sara.

Grayson, you are acting like a total pursey.
A... (Beep) Okay, look at this.
You're painting her toenails.
Whoa.
How did Travis get this picture?
That's in my bedroom.

(Sighs)
You enjoy your shower?
Yeah.
Ho ho!
Yay!
Mine!
Yes!
(Camera shutter snaps)
(Singsongy) Sha-bam.
Damn it, Andy.
For once I was coming to you, and you ruined it!
Your bucket was supposed to be filled with fish guts, but I looked inside, and it was nothing but sex.
What?
It was just an eighth of a second.
Can't we get that moment back?
(Makes whooshing sound)
It's all-natural light.
Dude, a bucket head?
Really?
Ah, I took a swing.
Don't help anymore.
What you guys looking at?
I present to you the crown jewel of stolen moments. (Chuckles)
Me butt-naked.
Let me see that, 'cause I'm gonna smash your camera.
No, no, no, no.
Give it!
Oh!
Oh, chill, el.
I've seen you nude.
Man, I videotaped the birth of your child, for crying out loud.
At least here you're not all, y know, inside out.
No one's seeing that picture.
But what about all the stuff you said about art being more important than vanity?
Oh, no.
How will I sleep at night?
Oh, right.
I have pills for that.
Are you really criticizing me for taking care of my girlfriend?
♪ I am ♪ okay, I hate myself, but you see how annoying that is?
I'm finally in a real relationship again.
I'm trying to really be in it.
Okay?
Hell, you've been on me since the day met to be more open and emotionally available.
But I didn't want you to become a lady Butler.
I'm not a lady Butler.
You're right.
You're not.
Because I've met a lady Butler before, and see, um, they don't talk baby talk.
(Baby voice) Oh, sare-bear, I wuv you so much.
It's like I don't have teeth no mo'.
Sara loves that I'm so into her.
(Normal voice) No, she doesn't.
If you keep it up, you watch.
She's gonna say she needs space and she'll start pulling away.
You don't know that.
(Electronic male voice) Furasshu.
Shut up!
Don't you yell at my toilet.
Look, I'm sorry that I found someone that I care about.
I didn't realize it would make you so jealous.
I'm not jealous.
I'm happy for you.
I may not be expressing it with my tone right now, but I am.
If anybody's jealous, you're jealous of me and my bathroom.
So you a obviously insane, so I'll just say...
Back... the hell... off.
(Melancholy tone plays) (Electronic male voice speaks indistinctly)
You said it.
Can you believe Grayson?
Jealous?
I'm not jealous.
You are a little jealous.
I know.
But he doesn't know that.
This is where your family hangs out now?
Yep.
Get comfortable. (Chuckles)
Oh, no, no, no, no.
We don't touch the towels in the special bathroom. (Whispers) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, sorry.
Just don't do it again. (Chuckles)
Maybe with Grayson and Sara, it would be better to, you know, not butt in.
Yes, I meddle, but I do it because I know ultimately, you're all grateful.
We are?
You--you sure about that?
Yes.
You love it that I care so much.
I mean, if Travis knew I was doing it, he'd probably thank me for trimming his hair while he's sleeping.
I knew it.
You know I want to grow it out.
Sweetie, it hides your pretty face.
Kylie!
Get your grubby paws off my towels.
She was pretty clear the first ti.
Fine.
You want me to back off?
Okay, then guess what.
I'm out.
I will never meddle in your lives again.
(Laughing)
(Laughs)
You know what?
We'll see.
Everybody, go.
Get out.
I'm gonna press Mr. toilet man's "no" button.
Go.
Hey, uh, Mrs. Torres?
(Liquid splashing)
(Jules) No!
What are you doing to me?
!
Will you please change your mind about letting me use your picture?
No chance, Lance.
(Sighs) Can you believe her?
Travis, you're such an ass.
What just happened?
(Door opens and closes)
Never press the "no" button.
(Grunts)
Sorry it didn't work.
Apology hug accepted.
(Grunts) (Grunts)
So Ellie just dropped robe, and the bucket head just disappeared, huh?
(Sighs) The bucket didn't disappear.
I'm sorry, my hot naked wife with a bucket head?
I'm in.
You just need to get to a place where there's no sexual desire left whatsoever.
I can probably do that if I spent a little private time with... you know, myself.
Hey, there's nothing wrong with making shower babies.
All right, it's not a sin if you're doing it for love. (Mutters)
For love.
For love!
It's great of you to have me over.
I've missed our talks.
I just feel like you get me.
More pinot?
Bring it.
So my dad and I went to counseling together.
Now do you think we should try- let me stop you right there, Gerald.
I'm done with meddling.
I stuck my nose in my friend's business, and I hurt him.
I probably wasn't even right about it anyway.
(Man speaking indistinctly on tv) Hey.
I figured your footsies were cold, so I warmed up your socks in the dryer.
(Turns off tv) Oh, come on, sweetie.
You gotta push.
It's a 2-person effort.
(Chuckles)
Um, thanks.
You know, I think maybe I might just crash at my place tonight, just get a little space.
Oh.
Yeah.
That's cool.
I just need to let people be.
Jules, you have a gift, and that gift is helping people.
You did it for me.
Last night, my dad and I hugged for the first time.
Was it as beautiful as it was in my dreams?
Take a guess.
You need to get back to butting' in.
What if people never realize how much I help them that's the burden of being a hero.
I'm like Batman.
(Chuckles) Ank you, Gerald.
No, thank you.
Not many clients invite me back just to talk.
Yeah, about that-- see, um, there's a few tiles over there that are just a little uneven.
Oh, no.
My dad was right.
I'm useless.
No.
It's my fault.
How could it be your fault?
I don't know.
Just fix it, Gerald.
Got it.
Why is Kylie so mad?
Could be nothing.
Could be that she's pretending to be angry so she doesn't feel so guilty about being knocked up with someone else's kid.
That's comforting.
She's mad 'cause you fought to use my photo, not hers.
Women do love when men fight for them.
There is nothing less sexy than a dude who respects a restraining order.
Ugh.
That's a great story.
Look, trav, it's all about effort.
There is no end to what a man must do for a woman.
(Spanish accent) Hey there, baby.
(Lighter clicks)
You don't look like you're from around here.
Are you lost, Ellie Torres?
Hey.
What do you want?
Don't be rude.
I left my bathroom to come over here, and that's a big deal.
Well, you were right.
She asked for space.
I didn't expect to be right.
Really?
No, I-knew I would be..
Well, go ahead.
Gloat.
Later.
Now I'm here to apologize.
Scoot it.
See...
When you act like a pursey, you are just so not sexy.
Apology accepted.
I-I want you to be that edgy, aloof guy that I-I-I kind of find attractive.
But that's not for you, and it's not for Sara.
That's just for me, and...
Sorry.
(Whispers) I'm Batman. (Chuckles)
(Chuckles) How can I still not understand what women want?
Women just want a guy who- who respects our independence but also wants to take care of us.
We want a guy who's secure but also gets jealous.
We want a guy who truly listens to us but also wants us to kinda shut up.
Like yesterday, when you were being a little mean to me, but you weren't being too mean that was so hot.
Well, I know you want to tell me how to fix it with Sara, so go ahead.
It's easy.
Just treat her like you treat me.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. sad pants. (Pats leg)
It sucks being a dude.
Women want an everything man.
(Chuckles)
(Strums chords)
Come on.
I'm in the mood fotacos.
Yeah, well, I'm kinda in the middle of something.
But I'm hungry.
Then why don't you run out and grab us some tacos and bring 'em back?
All right.

W. She is way, way better than you.
Shut up.
That was fun.
Yeah, for you.
I carried your ass.
Bitch, please.
So you fixed him.
Are you happy?
(Speaks indistinctly)
I really don't know.
(Camera shutter clicks)
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
There's no scuffing the tiles.
Take your shoes off.
Booties in the bin.
You need to leave this room.
Not happening'.
Andy, grab her feet.
No!
No, I don't want to go!
I don't want to go!
No!
(Ellie) Jules, it's fine.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Let me at least just grab one of these fancy towels!
You don't need a towel.
(Jules) I got two.
I got two.
I got 'em!
All right, toilet man.
I'm not afraid.
I am pressing that "no" button.
Bring it.
(Liquid splashing) Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Hell, yeah!
Great shirt alert.
- Yeah?
- No.
I just made up that phrase "Great shirt alert,"
And it's really fun to say.
Oh, well, you should have said it to Andy.
- I mean, come on.
Great shirt alert.
-Yeah?
No.
I just wanted to try saying it.
Jules, you're right.
It's so fun!
I have had the worst writer's block.
This is the only song
I've been able to come up with in the last three weeks.
Writer's block, writer's block, writer's writer's, writer's, writer's, block, block, block, block
Hear that?
That's what your stupid songs sound like in my head!
Why do we still have to hang out here when your bathroom's being remodeled?
My kitchen is our hangout.
It's--it's our turf.
It's our clubhouse.
Our... barrio.
Why did you teach her how to roll her r's?
Molly...
Ringwald.
I'm really sorry.
Oh, come on.
The construction's not that bad.
You know, we got to meet Gerald.
This has been a great couple of weeks.
You guys really got me through some stuff.
We know your father's a tough cookie.
But just remember, all that yelling is just him showing you his love, you know?
- I do now.
- Who lays tile better than you?
No one.
I can do this.
- He's back.
- You go, Gerald!
You dad was wrong about you!
His dad was not wrong,
But you do what you do for good tile, you know?
Oh, I can't wait for this bathroom to be done!
In fact, put it in your calendars, because I'm gonna have a bathroom-warming party.
Can I bring Sara to what sounds like the worst party ever?
Ooh, you mean Sara, your new girlfriend?
Oh, that was embarrassing.
I-I thought you were all gonna do it.
Hey, where did you even find the space to put in a giant master bathroom?
Balls!
I love you.
- Not happening.
- What do you mean, "Not happening"?
I'm not allowed to love you?
That "I love you" Doesn't mean "I love you."
It means "Let's have sex."
It doesn't this time.
Trust me.
- I can be quick.
- You broke the trust!
Look, our sex schedule is one and a half times a week.
It has been ten days since our one or our half.
Our half?
Come on.
It's your half.
- Yeah, it is.
- I admit, it's be too long,
But I got sidelined by that U.T.I.
All right, react.
But now you want sex so badly that it's too much pressure.
- It makes me not want it.
- So you want me to not want it?
No, I want you to want it, but I don't want to know you want it.
How will you know I want it?
If I want it, you'll want it.
True.
Okay.
We can do this.
- Okay.
- All right.
Just give me my half!
Hey, thanks for doing this.
I can't believe your school makes you do photo projects.
It's like they cater to the weird, artsy-fartsy kids.
- I started the photography club.
- Cool.
Nice save.
All right, now this is...
all about stolen moments.
So you just gotta pretend like I'm not here.
Just do it, nerd.
Hurtful.
Okay, one, two, three.
Seriously?
If there's a camera around, we bring the sexy.
It's how we do.
Well, the camera would beg to differ.
- It's a devil camera!
- I'm a seal.
No posing, okay?
Just go sit on the bench and talk.
Oh, I know.
Why don't we play that game where we guess who's gonna die first?
- Laurie.
- Laurie.
You get defibrillated at a Kid Rock concert one time...
How do you feel about Grayson being in a real relationship?
I don't know.
And I can't really be jealous because I never got in the game.
But honestly, it--it does kinda suck.
Sha-boom.
A moment has been stolen.
Travis, let me see that.
I was sad.
That's not fair.
Ooh.
Whoa.
I look hot when I'm depressed.
That's why I always get hit on when I'm at funerals.
Aw, why can't someone die?
Stop it.
You're Jules, right?
I'm Sara.
- Oh.
Hi.
You're-- you're grayson's - uh-
- I am.
Have a seat.
Well, I'm just gonna dive right in.
You've got gorgeous hair.
It's like you hit your head on a rock, and honey is pouring out.
I just had it done for your bathroom party.
Twice.
Oh, I forgot.
You don't know me.
- I'm insane!
- No way!
Me, too.
Hey, don't be nervous about tonight, okay?
'cause it's totally casual.
I mean, don't wear jeans, 'cause we're not animals.
Okay, thanks.
Oh, I gotta run.
You know, you're as cool as Grayson said.
Peace.
Peace?
What kind of a skank wears a watch?
Nice try, Laurie, but I like her.
- Oh, you're serious.
- Yeah.
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?
She let you kiss her that way?
Yeah, dad.
I lick her mouth.
Sha-bammy!
I'm making out with a dog.
Delete that.
Fine.
You might want to take some notes, junior.
Dog Travis has more game than you.
Look, I got it covered, all right?
Travis!
You just undid my bra!
Seriously?
I've got got heated floors, a steam shower, flat screen, and check out the tub.
It is so deep I can rent it out for water births.
Wow, Jules!
It's like a bathroom from a fairy tale!
I can totally picture a princess copping a squat in here.
We're in a bathroom.
- Is that one of those electronic toilet seats from Japan?
- Mm-hmm.
Holy gods, it cleans your hoo.
There are a lot more settings to figure out.
You know, there's one button that just says "No." Oh.
- Oh, I can't wait to push that.
- I'll bet.
The only downside is that sometimes it yells at me in Japanese.
Wow.
Brace yourselves.
Grayson's on his way up with Sara.
Oh, here we go.
What?
Is he being more of a cocky jerk now that he has a girlfriend?
No, sort of the opposite.
Sorry we're late.
Yeah, my little Sare-bear's tummy was growling... so we got a wittle num-num.
A wittle num-num-num-num-num.
Oh, no.
Here.
Let me take your purse.
What do you got in there, rocks?
I'm kidding, you.
Sha-moo.
Furasshu!
Oh, that means "Flush."
Hey, sorry.
I'd love to stay, but the old ball and chain...
I'm kidding.
Bye, guys.
Bye!
See ya!
we'll miss you!
Oh, no!
Oh, my lord!
Downright painful.
Did you see Grayson just standing there, holding Sara's purse?
I've got one better than "Great shirt alert."
Grayson is totally pursey-whipped.
That's good.
That is really gonna catchon.
Pursey magnet.
Pursey hound.
- Pursey cat.
- That's not how it works.
Maybe Grayson's just being careful because--
I'm sorry.
I just-
- I-I really miss my bathroom.
Ahh.
Yes.
Continue.
Maybe Grayson's just being careful because it's a new relationship.
They probably haven't even shaved each other yet.
I never got this whole Grayson thing, but now seeing him all weak and submissive, it's oh, so hot.
Come on.
I think it makes him so unattractive.
Yeah.
It's a total...
What?
It's the universal sign for lady turnoff.
No, it's--it's not.
He's just gonna push Sara away.
Wouldn't that make you happy?
I don't wanna watch a friend drown.
Plus, I-I like Sara.
She was so nice to me this morning when I ran into her.
I'm sorry I'm crying.
Your hair's so much nicer than mine.
I know.
Everything is.
That never happened.
That's how I remember it.
Why are you so into photography?
I feel like photos really capture our collective unconscious.
Plus, being pretentious really works on me.
You should work that angle in college.
Get yourself a scarf and watch the nerdy girls start throwing their legs open.
Yeah, I love Kylie.
I mean, even though we're going to different colleges,
I think we're gonna stay together.
Are you done?
No.
Oh!
I really dig this one of Kylie kissing the dog.
Looks like an old Portuguese man and his mistress.
She won't let me use it, though.
I had to pretend I deleted it.
Art should never be compromised for the sake of vanity.
Laurie, bring up coffee.
We're working in my bathroom today.
She slept in there last night.
Honey, you have a problem.
I don't have a problem.
Are you planning on leaving the bathroom today?
No, no, no.
Not--not today.
So Ellie pulled the whole to-get-sex-more- you-have-to-want-it-less thing?
Classic.
I can't handle it, man.
I'm not strong enough.
- Calm down, A-team.
- You calm down!
Look, what you need to do is just picture Ellie with a bucket head.
A bucket on her head?
No, the bucket is her head.
How would that help?
Have you ever looked inside of a bucket and not seen something disgusting?
Fish guts, dip, spit, dead rats.
That'll work.
Sorry I yelled.
apology hug.
Ellie thinks our apology hugs are weird.
She's weird.
Apology accepted.
Still having writer's block?
Trying to break it by singing every word I say
Damn it!
I just got perfume all over my contracts.
That's it.
If I wanted to be a bathroom attendant,
I would have stayed a bathroom attendant.
Good day.
So...
Why did you have me over?
I grabbed one of Travis' cameras, because I wanted to show you some of the pictures that he's been taking of you and Sara.
Well, there you are spoon-feeding her ice cream... brushing her glorious hair...
Sare-bear.
Grayson, you are acting like a total pursey.
Okay, look at this.
You're painting her toenails.
Whoa.
How did Travis get this picture?
That's in my bedroom.
You enjoy your shower?
Yeah.
Ho ho!
Yay!
Mine!
Yes!
Damn it, Andy.
For once I was coming to you, and you ruined it!
Your bucket was supposed to be filled with fish guts, but I looked inside, and it was nothing but sex.
- What?
- It was just an eighth of a second.
Can't we get that moment back?
It's all-natural light.
Dude, a bucket head?
- Really?
- Ah, I took a swing.
Don't help anymore.
What you guys looking at?
I present to you the crown jewel of stolen moments.
Me butt-naked.
Let me see that, 'cause i'm gonna smash your camera.
- No, no, no, no.
- Give it!
Oh!
Oh, chill, El.
I've seen you nude.
Man, I videotaped the birth of your child, for crying out loud.
At least here you're not all, you know,
- inside out.
- No one's seeing that picture.
But what about all the stuff you said about art being more important than vanity?
Oh, no.
How will I sleep at night?
Oh, right.
I have pills for that.
Are you really criticizing me for taking care of my girlfriend?
I am.
Okay, I hate myself, but you see how annoying that is?
I'm finally in a real relationship again.
I'm trying to really be in it.
Okay?
Hell, you've been on me since the day we met to be more open and emotionally available.
But I didn't want you to become a lady butler.
I'm not a lady butler.
You're right.
You're not.
Because I've met a lady butler before, and see, um, they don't talk baby talk.
Oh, Sare-bear, I wuv you so much.
It's like I don't have teeth no mo'.
Sara loves that I'm so into her.
no, she doesn't.
If you keep it up, you watch.
She's gonna say she needs space and she'll start pulling away.
- You don't know that.
- Furasshu.
- Shut up!
- Don't you yell at my toilet.
Look, I'm sorry that I found someone that I care about.
I didn't realize it would make you so jealous.
I'm not jealous.
I'm happy for you.
I may not be expressing it with my tone right now, but I am.
If anybody's jealous, you're jealous of me and my bathroom.
So you a obviously insane,
So I'll just say...
Back...
The hell...
Off.
You said it.
Can you believe Grayson?
Jealous?
I'm not jealous.
You are a little jealous.
I know.
But he doesn't know that.
This is where your family hangs out now?
Yep.
Get comfortable.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
We don't touch the towels in the special bathroom.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, sorry.
- Just don't do it again.
Maybe with Grayson and Sara,
It would be better to, you know,
Not butt in.
Yes, I meddle, but I do it because
I know ultimately, you're all grateful.
- We are?
- You--you sure about that?
Yes.
You love it that I care so much.
I mean, if Travis knew
I was doing it, he'd probably thank me for trimming his hair while he's sleeping.
I knew it.
You know I want to grow it out.
Sweetie, it hides your pretty face.
Kylie!
Get your grubby paws off my towels.
She was pretty clear the first time.
Fine.
You want me to back off?
Okay, then guess what.
I'm out.
I will never meddle in your lives again.
You know what?
We'll see.
Everybody, go.
Get out.
I'm gonna press mr.
Toilet man's "No" Button.
Go.
Hey, uh, Mrs. Torres?
No!
What are you doing to me?
!
Will you please change your mind about letting me use your picture?
No chance, lance.
Can you believe her?
Travis, you're such an ass.
What just happened?
Never press the "No" Button.
Sorry it didn't work.
Apology hug accepted.
So Ellie just dropped robe, and the bucket head just disappeared, huh?
The bucket didn't disappear.
I'm sorry, my hot naked wife with a bucket head?
I'm in.
You just need to get to a place where there's no sexual desire left whatsoever.
I can probably do that if I spent a little private time with...
You know, myself.
Hey, there's nothing wrong with making shower babies.
All right, it's not a sin if you're doing it for love.
For love.
For love!
It's great of you to have me over.
I've missed our talks.
I just feel like you get me.
More pinot?
Bring it.
So my dad and I went to counseling together.
Now do you think we should try
Let me stop you right there, Gerald.
I'm done with meddling.
I stuck my nose in my friend's business, and I hurt him.
I probably wasn't even right about it anyway.
Hey.
I figured your footsies were cold, so I warmed up your socks in the dryer.
Oh, come on, sweetie.
You gotta push.
It's a 2-person effort.
Um, thanks.
You know, I think maybe I might just crash at my place tonight,
Just get a little space.
Oh.
Yeah.
That's cool.
I just need to let people be.
Jules, you have a gift,
And that gift is helping people.
You did it for me.
Last night, my dad and I hugged for the first time.
Was it as beautiful as it was in my dreams?
Take a guess.
You need to get back to butting' in.
What if people never realize how much I help them.
That's the burden of being a hero.
I'm like batman.
Thank you, Gerald.
No, thank you.
Not many clients invite me back just to talk.
Yeah, about that--
See, um, there's a few tiles over there that are just a little uneven.
Oh, no.
My dad was right.
I'm useless.
- No.
It's my fault.
- How could it be your fault?
I don't know.
Just fix it, Gerald.
Got it.
Why is Kylie so mad?
Could be nothing.
Could be that she's pretending to be angry so she doesn't feel so guilty about being knocked up with someone else's kid.
That's comforting.
She's mad 'cause you fought to use my photo, not hers.
Women do love when men fight for them.
There is nothing less sexy than a dude who respects a restraining order.
That's a great story.
Look, Trav, it's all about effort.
There is no end to what a man must do for a woman.
Hey there, baby.
You don't look like you're from around here.
Are you lost, Ellie Torres?
What do you want?
Don't be rude.
I left my bathroom to come over here, and that's a big deal.
Well, you were right.
She asked for space.
I didn't expect to be right.

Well, go ahead.

When you act like a pursey, you are just so not sexy.
Apology accepted.
I-I want you to be that edgy, aloof guy that I-I-I kind of find attractive.
But that's not for you, and it's not for Sara.
That's just for me, and...
Sorry.
I'm batman.
How can I still not understand what women want?
Women just want a guy who-- who respects our independence but also wants to take care of us.
We want a guy who's secure but also gets jealous.
We want a guy who truly listens to us but also wants us to kinda shut up.

That was so hot.

Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Sad Pants.
It sucks being a dude.
Women want an everything man.
Come on.
I'm in the mood for tacos.
Yeah, well, I'm kinda in the middle of something.
- But I'm hungry.
- Then why don't you run out and grab us some tacos and bring 'em back?
All right.
Run along.
Runnin' Runnin'
Runnin' just as fast as I can
Tryin' to be your everything man
Give me 20 minutes?
Please let me use your picture.
You want me all edgy, but there's always a hitch
I have to stay loyal when you act like a bitch
You want toughness and sweetness and softness and meanness wanna make me the master of this in-between-ness
Runnin', Runnin'
Runnin' just as fast as I can
I'm trying to be your everything man
Please be my
You know I'm gonna try
I can be your everything man
He's gonna be my everything man--an
She is way, way better than you.
- Shut up.
- That was fun.
Yeah, for you.
I carried your ass.
Bitch, please.
So you fixed him.
Are you happy?
I really don't know.
There's no scuffing the tiles.
Take your shoes off.
Booties in the bin.
- You need to leave this room.
- Not happening'.
- Andy, grab her feet.
- No!
No, I don't want to go!
I don't want to go!

No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Let me at least just grab one of these fancy towels!
You don't need a towel.
I got two.
I got two.
I got 'em!
All right, toilet man.
I'm not afraid.
I am pressing that "No" Button.
Bring it.
Hell, yeah!
- Ooh!
Great shirt alert.
- Yeah?
No.
I just made up that phrase, "great shirt alert,"
and it's really fun to say.
Well, you should've said it to Andy.
I mean, come on.
- Great shirt alert.
- Yeah?
No.
I just wanted to try saying it.
Jules, you're right.
It's so fun!
[Grayson] I have had the worst writer's block.
This is the only song I've been able to come up with in the last three weeks.
* Writer's block, writer's block * [continues singing]
[Saw buzzing, hammering]
Hear that?
That's what your stupid songs sound like in my head!
Why do we still have to hang out here when your bathroom's being remodeled?
My kitchen is our hangout.
It's our turf.
It's our clubhouse.
Our... barrio.
Why did you teach her how to roll her "R"s?
Molly Ringwald.
I'm really sorry.
Oh, come on.
The construction's not that bad.
- We got to meet Gerald.
- This has been a great couple of weeks.
You guys really got me through some stuff.
We know your father's a tough cookie.
But just remember, all that yelling is just him showing you his love, you know?

- Who lays tile better than you?
No one.
I can do this.
- He's back.
- You go, Gerald!
Your dad was wrong about you!
His dad was not wrong.
But you do what you do for good tile.
Oh!
I can't wait for this bathroom to be done!
In fact, put it in your calendars, because I'm gonna have a bathroom warming party.
Can I bring Sara to what sounds like the worst party ever?
Oh!
You mean Sara, your new girlfriend?
Ooh!
That was embarrassing.
I thought you were all gonna do it.
Hey, where did you even find the space to put in a giant master bathroom?
Balls!
- I love you.
- Not happening.
What do you mean, "Not happening?" I'm not allowed to love you?
That "I love you" doesn't mean, "I love you," it means, "Let's have sex."
It doesn't this time.
Trust me.
- I can be quick.
- You broke the trust!
Our sex schedule is one and a half times a week.
It has been ten days since our one or our half.
Our half?
Come on.
It's your half.
- Yeah, it is.
- I admit, it's been too long, but I got sidelined by that UTI.
- All right, react.
- [Gagging]
But now you want sex so badly that it's too much pressure.
- It makes me not want it.
- So you want me to not want it?
No, I want you to want it, but I don't want to know you want it.
- How will you know I want it?
- If I want it, you'll want it.
True.
OK.
We can do this.
- OK.
- All right.
Just give me my half!
Hey, thanks for doing this.

Just go sit on the bench and talk.
Oh, I know.
Why don't we play that game where we guess who's gonna die first?
- Laurie.
- [Ellie] Laurie.
You get defibrillated at a Kid Rock concert one time...
Well...
How do you feel about Grayson being in a real relationship?
I don't know.
I can't really be jealous because I never got in the game.
But honestly, it does kinda suck.
- [Camera clicks]
- Shaboom!
A moment has been stolen.
Travis, let me see that.
I was sad.
That's not fair.
[Jules] Oh!
Whoa!
I look hot when I'm depressed.
Oh!
That's why I always get hit on when I'm at funerals.
Oh, why can't someone die?
Stop it.
You're Jules, right?
I'm Sara.
- Oh.
Hi.
You're Grayson's...
- I am.
[Chuckles] Have a seat.
Well, I'm just gonna dive right in.
You've got gorgeous hair.
It's like you hit your head on a rock, and honey is pouring out.
I just had it done for your bathroom party.
Twice.
Oh, I forgot.
You don't know me.
- I'm insane!
- No way!
Me, too.
Don't be nervous about tonight, OK?
'Cause it's totally casual.
Don't wear jeans, 'cause we're not animals.
OK, thanks.
Oh, I gotta run.
You know, you're as cool as Grayson said.
Peace.
"Peace?"
What kind of a skank wears a watch?
Nice try, Laurie, but I like her.
[Laughing]
- Oh, you're serious.
- Yeah.
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?
- She let you kiss her that way?
- Yeah, Dad.
I lick her mouth.
[Camera clicks]
[Travis] Shabamy!
[Scoffs] I'm making out with a dog.
Delete that.
Fine.
[Bobby] You might want to take some notes, junior.
Dog Travis has more game than you.
Look, I got it covered, all right?
[Gasps] Travis!
You just undid my bra!
Seriously?
I've got heated floors, a steam shower, flat screen and check out the tub.
It is so deep I can rent it out for water births.
[Laurie] Wow, Jules!
It's like a bathroom from a fairy tale!
I can totally picture a princess copping a squat in here.
We're in a bathroom.
Is that one of those electronic toilet seats from Japan?
- Mm-hmm!
- Holy gods, it cleans your hoo.
There are a lot more settings to figure out.
There's one button that just says, "No."
- I can't wait to push that.
- I'll bet.
[Jules] The only downside is sometimes it yells at me in Japanese.
Hmm?
Wow, brace yourselves.
Grayson's on his way up with Sara.
- Oh, here we go.
- [Jules] What?
Is he being more of a cocky jerk now that he has a girlfriend?
- [Bobby] Sort of the opposite.
- [Sara] Sorry we're late.
Yeah, my little Sare Bear's tummy was growling, so we got a wittle num num.
- A wittle num num...
- Oh, no.
Let me take your purse.
Whoa!
What do you got in there, rocks?
[Chuckling] I'm kidding, you.
Sha-moo!
[Camera clicks]
- [Speaking Japanese] - [Flushes]
Oh, that means "flush."
Yay!
[Applauding]
Hey, sorry.
I'd love to stay, but the old ball and chain...
I'm kidding.
Bye, guys.
- [Andy] Bye!
- [Travis] See ya!
- [Laurie] Oh, no!
- [Bobby] Oh, my Lord!
Downright painful.
Did you see Grayson just standing there, holding Sara's purse?
I've got one better than, "Great shirt alert."
Grayson is totally "pursey-whipped."
- [Laughing]
- That's good.
That is really gonna catch on.
Pursey-magnet.
Pursey-hound.
- Pursey-cat.
- That's not how it works.
- Maybe Grayson's just being careful...
- [Jules] I'm sorry.
I just...
I really miss my bathroom.
Ah!
Yes.
Continue.
Maybe Grayson's just being careful because it's a new relationship.
They probably haven't even shaved each other yet.
[Ellie] I never got this whole Grayson thing, but now seeing him all weak and submissive, it's oh, so hot.
Come on.
- It makes him so unattractive.
- It's a total... [whipping sound]
What?
It's the universal sign for lady turnoff.
No, it's not.
- He's gonna push Sara away.
- Wouldn't that make you happy?
I don't wanna watch a friend drown.
Plus, I like Sara.
She was so nice to me this morning when I ran into her.
[Sara] I'm sorry I'm crying.
Your hair's so much nicer than mine.
I know.
Everything is.
- That never happened.
- That's how I remember it.
Why are you so into photography?
I feel like photos really capture our collective unconscious.
Plus, being pretentious really works on me.
You should work that angle in college.
Get yourself a scarf and watch the nerdy girls start throwing their legs open.
Yeah, I love Kylie.
Even though we're going to different colleges,
I think we're gonna stay together.
[Laughing]
Are you done?
- [Both] No.
- [Laughing]
Oh!
I really dig this one of Kylie kissing the dog.
Looks like an old Portuguese man and his mistress.
She won't let me use it.
I had to pretend I deleted it.
Art should never be compromised for the sake of vanity.
[Jules] Laurie, bring up coffee.
We're working in my bathroom today.
She slept in there last night.
- [Laurie] Honey, you have a problem.
- I don't have a problem.
Are you planning on leaving the bathroom today?
No, no, no.
Not today.
So Ellie pulled the whole "to get sex more you have to want it less" thing?
[Chuckling] Classic.
I can't handle it, man.
I'm not strong enough.
- Calm down, A-Team.
- You calm down!
Look, what you need to do is just picture Ellie with a bucket head.
- A bucket on her head?
- No, the bucket is her head.
How would that help?
You ever looked inside a bucket and not seen something disgusting?
Fish guts, dip, spit, dead rats.
That'll work.
- Sorry I yelled.
- Apology hug.
[Grunts]
Ellie thinks our apology hugs are weird.
She's weird.
Apology accepted.
Still having writer's block?
* Tryin' to break it by singin' every word I say
Damn it!
I just got perfume all over my contracts.
That's it!
If I wanted to be a bathroom attendant,
I would have stayed a bathroom attendant.
- Good day.
- So...
* Why did you have me over?
I grabbed one of Travis's cameras because I wanted to show you some of the pictures that he's been taking of you and Sara.
Well, there you are, spoon-feeding her ice cream.
Brushing her glorious hair.
Sare Bear!
Grayson, you are acting like a total pursey.
- A?
- OK, look at this.
- You're painting her toenails.
- Whoa!
How did Travis get this picture?
That's in my bedroom.
[Camera clicking]
- You enjoy your shower?
- Yeah.
Whoa!
Game on!
Yes!
[Camera clicks]
Shabam!
Damn it, Andy.
For once I was coming to you, and you ruined it!
Your bucket was supposed to be filled with fish guts, but I looked inside, and it was nothing but sex.
- What?
- It was just an eighth of a second.
Can't we get that moment back?
[Whipping sound]
It's all natural light.
Dude, a bucket head?
Really?
- Eh, I took a swing.
- Don't help anymore.
What you guys looking at?
I present to you the crown jewel of stolen moments.
Me butt naked.
Let me see that. 'Cause I'm gonna smash your camera.
- No, no, no.
- [Ellie] Give it!
Chill, EI, I've seen you nude.
I videotaped the birth of your child, for crying out loud.
At least here, you're not all, you know inside out.
- No one's seeing that picture.
What about all the stuff you said about art being more important than vanity?
[Ellie] Oh, no.
How will I sleep at night?
Oh, right.
I have pills for that.
Are you really criticizing me for taking care of my girlfriend?
* I am *
OK, I hate myself, but you see how annoying that is?
I'm finally in a real relationship again.
I'm trying to really be in it.
OK?
Hell, you've been on me since the day we met to be more open and emotionally available.
But I didn't want you to become a lady butler.
- I'm not a lady butler.
- You're right.
You're not.
Because I've met a lady butler before, and see, they don't talk baby talk.
"Oh, Sare Bear, I love you so much.
It's like I don't have teeth no mo'."
Sara loves that I'm so into her.
No, she doesn't.
If you keep it up, you watch, she's gonna say she needs space and she'll start pulling away.
- You don't know that.
- [Speaking Japanese]
- Shut up!
- Don't you yell at my toilet.
Look, I'm sorry that I found someone I care about.
I didn't realize it would make you so jealous.
I'm not jealous.
I'm happy for you.
I may not be expressing it with my tone right now, but I am.
If anybody's jealous, you're jealous of me and my bathroom.
So you are obviously insane, so I'll just say back... the hell... off.
[Speaking Japanese]
You said it.
Can you believe Grayson?
Jealous?
I'm not jealous.
You are a little jealous.
I know.
But he doesn't know that.
This is where your family hangs out now?
Yep.
Get comfortable.
[Jules] Oh, no, no, no.
No.
We don't touch the towels in the special bathroom.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, sorry.
- Just don't do it again.
- [Laurie] Maybe with Grayson and Sara, it would be better to, you know not butt in.
Yes, I meddle, but I do it because I know, ultimately, you're all grateful.
We are?
You sure about that?
Yes.
You love it that I care so much.
If Travis knew I was doing it, he'd thank me for trimming his hair while he's sleeping.
I knew it.
You know I want to grow it out.
[Jules] Sweetie, it hides your pretty face.
Kylie!
Get your grubby paws off my towels!
She was pretty clear the first time.
[Jules] Fine.
You want me to back off?
OK, then guess what?
I'm out.
I will never meddle in your lives again.
[Laughing]
[Imitating laughter]
[Jules] You know what?
We'll see.
Everybody go.
Get out.
I'm gonna press Mr. Toilet Man's "No" button.
Go.
Hey, uh, Mrs. Torres?
- [Water rushing] - [Jules] No!
What are you doing to me?
!
Will you please change your mind about letting me use your picture?
- No chance, Lance.
- [Sighs]
- Can you believe her?
- Travis, you're such an ass.
What just happened?
Never press the "No" button.
- Sorry it didn't work.
- Apology hug accepted.
So Ellie just dropped robe, and the bucket head just disappeared?
The bucket didn't disappear.
I'm sorry, my hot naked wife with a bucket head?
- I'm in.
- You just need to get to a place where there's no sexual desire left whatsoever.
I can probably do that if I spent a little private time with you know, myself.
Hey, there's nothing wrong with making shower babies.
It's not a sin if you're doing it for love.
[Mumbles]
For love.
For love!
It's great of you to have me over.
I've missed our talks.
I just feel like you get me.
- More pinot?
- Bring it.
So my dad and I went to counseling together.
Do you think we should try?
Let me stop you right there, Gerald.
I'm done with meddling.
I stuck my nose in my friend's business, and I hurt him.
I probably wasn't even right about it anyway.
Hey.
I figured your footsies were cold, so I warmed up your socks in the dryer.
Come on, sweetie.
You gotta push.
It's a two-person effort.
Um...
Thanks.
You know, I was thinking maybe I might just crash at my place tonight.
- Just get a little space.
- Oh, yeah.
That's cool.
I just need to let people be.
Jules, you have a gift, and that gift is helping people.
You did it for me.
Last night, my dad and I hugged for the first time.
Was it as beautiful as it was in my dreams?
Take a guess.
You need to get back to butting' in.
What if people never realize how much I help them?
That's the burden of being a hero.
I'm like Batman.
[Gasps]
- Thank you, Gerald.
- No, thank you.
Not many clients invite me back just to talk.
Yeah, about that...
See, there's a few tiles over there that are just a little uneven.
Oh, no.
My dad was right.
I'm useless.
- No.
It's my fault.
- How could it be your fault?
- I don't know.
Just fix it, Gerald.
- Got it.
- Why is Kylie so mad?
- Could be nothing.
Could be that she's pretending to be angry so she doesn't feel so guilty about being knocked up with someone else's kid.
That's comforting.
She's mad because you fought to use my photo, not hers.
[Laurie] Women do love when men fight for them.
There is nothing less sexy than a dude who respects a restraining order.
That's a great story.
Look, Trav, it's all about effort.
There is no end to what a man must do for a woman.
[Andy] Hey there, baby.
You don't look like you're from around here.
Are you lost, Ellie Torres?
Hey.
- What do you want?
- Don't be rude.
I left my bathroom to come over here, and that's a big deal.
Well, you were right.
She asked for space.
I didn't expect to be right.
- Really?
- No, I knew I would be.
Well, go ahead.
- Gloat.
- Later.
Now, I'm here to apologize.
Scoot it.
See...
When you act like a pursey, you are just so not sexy.
Apology accepted.
I want you to be that edgy, aloof guy that I kind of find attractive.
But that's not for you, and it's not for Sara.
That's just for me, and...
Sorry.
I'm Batman.
[Both laughing]
How can I still not understand what women want?
Women just want a guy who who respects our independence, but also wants to take care of us.
We want a guy who's secure, but also gets jealous.
We want a guy who truly listens to us, but also wants us to kinda shut up.
Like yesterday, when you were being a little mean to me, but you weren't being too mean?
That was so hot.
Well, I know you want to tell me how to fix it with Sara, so go ahead.
It's easy.
Just treat her like you treat me.
I'm sorry, Mr. Sad Pants.
It sucks being a dude.
Women want an everything man.
[Sara] Come on.
I'm in the mood for tacos.
Yeah, well, I'm kinda in the middle of something.
But I'm hungry.
Then why don't you run out and grab us some tacos and bring 'em back?
All right.
Run along.
* Runnin', runnin'
* Runnin'just as fast as I can
* Tryin' to be your everything man *
Give me 20 minutes?
Please let me use your picture.
[Applauding]
[Whistling]
Wow.
She is way, way better than you.
- Shut up.
- That was fun.
Yeah, for you.
I carried your ass.
Bitch, please!
So you fixed him.
Are you happy?
I really don't know.
[Camera clicks]
[Jules] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
There's no scuffing the tiles.
Take your shoes off.
Booties in the bin.
You need to leave this room.
Not happening'.
- Andy, grab her feet!
- [Jules] No!
No, I don't want to go!
- I don't want to go!
No!
- [Laurie] Jules, it's time.
No, no, no!
Let me at least just grab one of these fancy towels!
- [Laurie] You don't need a towel!
- I got two.
- I got 'em!
- All right, Toilet Man.
I'm not afraid.
I am pressing that "No" button.
Bring it.
- [Water rushing]
- Whoo!
Hoo-hoo!
Hell, yeah!
Great shirt alert.
- Yeah?
- No.
I just made up that phrase "Great shirt alert,"
And it's really fun to say.
Oh, well, you should have said it to Andy.
- I mean, come on.
Great shirt alert.
-Yeah?
No.
I just wanted to try saying it.
Jules, you're right.
It's so fun!
I have had the worst writer's block.
This is the only song
I've been able to come up with in the last three weeks.
Writer's block, writer's block, writer's writer's, writer's, writer's, block, block, block, block
Hear that?
That's what your stupid songs sound like in my head!
Why do we still have to hang out here when your bathroom's being remodeled?
My kitchen is our hangout.
It's--it's our turf.
It's our clubhouse.
Our... barrio.
Why did you teach her how to roll her r's?
Molly...
Ringwald.
I'm really sorry.
Oh, come on.
The construction's not that bad.
You know, we got to meet Gerald.
This has been a great couple of weeks.
You guys really got me through some stuff.
We know your father's a tough cookie.
But just remember, all that yelling is just him showing you his love, you know?
- I do now.
- Who lays tile better than you?
No one.
I can do this.
- He's back.
- You go, Gerald!
You dad was wrong about you!
His dad was not wrong,
But you do what you do for good tile, you know?
Oh, I can't wait for this bathroom to be done!
In fact, put it in your calendars, because I'm gonna have a bathroom-warming party.
Can I bring Sara to what sounds like the worst party ever?
Ooh, you mean Sara, your new girlfriend?
Oh, that was embarrassing.
I-I thought you were all gonna do it.
Hey, where did you even find the space to put in a giant master bathroom?
Balls!
I love you.
- Not happening.
- What do you mean, "Not happening"?
I'm not allowed to love you?
That "I love you" Doesn't mean "I love you."
It means "Let's have sex."
It doesn't this time.
Trust me.
- I can be quick.
- You broke the trust!
Look, our sex schedule is one and a half times a week.
It has been ten days since our one or our half.
Our half?
Come on.
It's your half.
- Yeah, it is.
- I admit, it's be too long,
But I got sidelined by that U.T.I.
All right, react.
But now you want sex so badly that it's too much pressure.
- It makes me not want it.
- So you want me to not want it?
No, I want you to want it, but I don't want to know you want it.
How will you know I want it?
If I want it, you'll want it.
True.
Okay.
We can do this.
- Okay.
- All right.
Just give me my half!
Hey, thanks for doing this.
I can't believe your school makes you do photo projects.
It's like they cater to the weird, artsy-fartsy kids.
- I started the photography club.
- Cool.
Nice save.
All right, now this is...
all about stolen moments.
So you just gotta pretend like I'm not here.
Just do it, nerd.
Hurtful.
Okay, one, two, three.
Seriously?
If there's a camera around, we bring the sexy.
It's how we do.
Well, the camera would beg to differ.
- It's a devil camera!
- I'm a seal.
No posing, okay?
Just go sit on the bench and talk.
Oh, I know.
Why don't we play that game where we guess who's gonna die first?
- Laurie.
- Laurie.
You get defibrillated at a Kid Rock concert one time...
How do you feel about Grayson being in a real relationship?
I don't know.
And I can't really be jealous because I never got in the game.
But honestly, it--it does kinda suck.
Sha-boom.
A moment has been stolen.
Travis, let me see that.
I was sad.
That's not fair.
Ooh.
Whoa.
I look hot when I'm depressed.
That's why I always get hit on when I'm at funerals.
Aw, why can't someone die?
Stop it.
You're Jules, right?
I'm Sara.
- Oh.
Hi.
You're-- you're grayson's - uh-
- I am.
Have a seat.
Well, I'm just gonna dive right in.
You've got gorgeous hair.
It's like you hit your head on a rock, and honey is pouring out.
I just had it done for your bathroom party.

Hey, don't be nervous about tonight, okay?
'cause it's totally casual.
I mean, don't wear jeans, 'cause we're not animals.
Okay, thanks.
Oh, I gotta run.
You know, you're as cool as Grayson said.
Peace.
Peace?
What kind of a skank wears a watch?
Nice try, Laurie, but I like her.
- Oh, you're serious.
- Yeah.
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?
She let you kiss her that way?
Yeah, dad.
I lick her mouth.
Sha-bammy!
I'm making out with a dog.
Delete that.
Fine.
You might want to take some notes, junior.
Dog Travis has more game than you.
Look, I got it covered, all right?
Travis!
You just undid my bra!
Seriously?
I've got got heated floors, a steam shower, flat screen, and check out the tub.
It is so deep I can rent it out for water births.
Wow, Jules!
It's like a bathroom from a fairy tale!
I can totally picture a princess copping a squat in here.
We're in a bathroom.

The only downside is that sometimes it yells at me in Japanese.
Wow.
Brace yourselves.
Grayson's on his way up with Sara.
Oh, here we go.
What?
Is he being more of a cocky jerk now that he has a girlfriend?
No, sort of the opposite.
Sorry we're late.
Yeah, my little Sare-bear's tummy was growling... so we got a wittle num-num.
A wittle num-num-num-num-num.
Oh, no.
Here.
Let me take your purse.
What do you got in there, rocks?
I'm kidding, you.
Sha-moo.
Furasshu!
Oh, that means "Flush."
Hey, sorry.
I'd love to stay, but the old ball and chain...
I'm kidding.
Bye, guys.
Bye!
See ya!
we'll miss you!
Oh, no!
Oh, my lord!
Downright painful.
Did you see Grayson just standing there, holding Sara's purse?
I've got one better than "Great shirt alert."
Grayson is totally pursey-whipped.
That's good.
That is really gonna catchon.
Pursey magnet.
Pursey hound.
- Pursey cat.
- That's not how it works.
Maybe Grayson's just being careful because--
I'm sorry.
I just-
- I-I really miss my bathroom.
Ahh.
Yes.
Continue.
Maybe Grayson's just being careful because it's a new relationship.
They probably haven't even shaved each other yet.
I never got this whole Grayson thing, but now seeing him all weak and submissive, it's oh, so hot.
Come on.
I think it makes him so unattractive.
Yeah.
It's a total...
What?
It's the universal sign for lady turnoff.
No, it's--it's not.
He's just gonna push Sara away.
Wouldn't that make you happy?
I don't wanna watch a friend drown.

No.
Oh!
I really dig this one of Kylie kissing the dog.
Looks like an old Portuguese man and his mistress.
She won't let me use it, though.
I had to pretend I deleted it.
Art should never be compromised for the sake of vanity.
Laurie, bring up coffee.
We're working in my bathroom today.
She slept in there last night.
Honey, you have a problem.
I don't have a problem.
Are you planning on leaving the bathroom today?
No, no, no.
Not--not today.
So Ellie pulled the whole to-get-sex-more- you-have-to-want-it-less thing?
Classic.
I can't handle it, man.
I'm not strong enough.
- Calm down, A-team.
- You calm down!
Look, what you need to do is just picture Ellie with a bucket head.
A bucket on her head?
No, the bucket is her head.
How would that help?
Have you ever looked inside of a bucket and not seen something disgusting?
Fish guts, dip, spit, dead rats.
That'll work.
Sorry I yelled.
apology hug.
Ellie thinks our apology hugs are weird.
She's weird.
Apology accepted.
Still having writer's block?
Trying to break it by singing every word I say
Damn it!
I just got perfume all over my contracts.
That's it.
If I wanted to be a bathroom attendant,
I would have stayed a bathroom attendant.
Good day.
So...
Why did you have me over?
I grabbed one of Travis' cameras, because I wanted to show you some of the pictures that he's been taking of you and Sara.
Well, there you are spoon-feeding her ice cream... brushing her glorious hair...
Sare-bear.
Grayson, you are acting like a total pursey.
Okay, look at this.
You're painting her toenails.
Whoa.
How did Travis get this picture?
That's in my bedroom.
You enjoy your shower?
Yeah.
Ho ho!
Yay!
Mine!
Yes!
Damn it, Andy.
For once I was coming to you, and you ruined it!
Your bucket was supposed to be filled with fish guts, but I looked inside, and it was nothing but sex.
- What?
- It was just an eighth of a second.
Can't we get that moment back?
It's all-natural light.
Dude, a bucket head?
- Really?
- Ah, I took a swing.
Don't help anymore.
What you guys looking at?
I present to you the crown jewel of stolen moments.
Me butt-naked.
Let me see that, 'cause i'm gonna smash your camera.
- No, no, no, no.
- Give it!
Oh!
Oh, chill, El.
I've seen you nude.
Man, I videotaped the birth of your child, for crying out loud.
At least here you're not all, you know,
- inside out.
- No one's seeing that picture.
But what about all the stuff you said about art being more important than vanity?
Oh, no.
How will I sleep at night?
Oh, right.
I have pills for that.
Are you really criticizing me for taking care of my girlfriend?
I am.
Okay, I hate myself, but you see how annoying that is?
I'm finally in a real relationship again.
I'm trying to really be in it.
Okay?
Hell, you've been on me since the day we met to be more open and emotionally available.
But I didn't want you to become a lady butler.
I'm not a lady butler.
You're right.
You're not.
Because I've met a lady butler before, and see, um, they don't talk baby talk.
Oh, Sare-bear, I wuv you so much.
It's like I don't have teeth no mo'.
Sara loves that I'm so into her.
no, she doesn't.
If you keep it up, you watch.
She's gonna say she needs space and she'll start pulling away.
- You don't know that.
- Furasshu.
- Shut up!
- Don't you yell at my toilet.
Look, I'm sorry that I found someone that I care about.
I didn't realize it would make you so jealous.
I'm not jealous.
I'm happy for you.
I may not be expressing it with my tone right now, but I am.
If anybody's jealous, you're jealous of me and my bathroom.
So you a obviously insane,
So I'll just say...
Back...
The hell...
Off.
You said it.
Can you believe Grayson?
Jealous?
I'm not jealous.
You are a little jealous.
I know.
But he doesn't know that.
This is where your family hangs out now?
Yep.
Get comfortable.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
We don't touch the towels in the special bathroom.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, sorry.
- Just don't do it again.
Maybe with Grayson and Sara,
It would be better to, you know,
Not butt in.
Yes, I meddle, but I do it because
I know ultimately, you're all grateful.
- We are?
- You--you sure about that?
Yes.
You love it that I care so much.
I mean, if Travis knew
I was doing it, he'd probably thank me for trimming his hair while he's sleeping.
I knew it.
You know I want to grow it out.
Sweetie, it hides your pretty face.
Kylie!
Get your grubby paws off my towels.
She was pretty clear the first time.
Fine.
You want me to back off?
Okay, then guess what.
I'm out.
I will never meddle in your lives again.
You know what?
We'll see.
Everybody, go.
Get out.
I'm gonna press mr.
Toilet man's "No" Button.
Go.
Hey, uh, Mrs. Torres?
No!
What are you doing to me?
!
Will you please change your mind about letting me use your picture?
No chance, lance.
Can you believe her?
Travis, you're such an ass.
What just happened?
Never press the "No" Button.
Sorry it didn't work.
Apology hug accepted.
So Ellie just dropped robe, and the bucket head just disappeared, huh?
The bucket didn't disappear.
I'm sorry, my hot naked wife with a bucket head?
I'm in.
You just need to get to a place where there's no sexual desire left whatsoever.
I can probably do that if I spent a little private time with...
You know, myself.
Hey, there's nothing wrong with making shower babies.
All right, it's not a sin if you're doing it for love.
For love.
For love!
It's great of you to have me over.
I've missed our talks.
I just feel like you get me.
More pinot?
Bring it.
So my dad and I went to counseling together.
Now do you think we should try
Let me stop you right there, Gerald.
I'm done with meddling.
I stuck my nose in my friend's business, and I hurt him.
I probably wasn't even right about it anyway.
Hey.
I figured your footsies were cold, so I warmed up your socks in the dryer.
Oh, come on, sweetie.
You gotta push.
It's a 2-person effort.
Um, thanks.
You know, I think maybe I might just crash at my place tonight,
Just get a little space.
Oh.
Yeah.
That's cool.
I just need to let people be.
Jules, you have a gift,
And that gift is helping people.
You did it for me.
Last night, my dad and I hugged for the first time.
Was it as beautiful as it was in my dreams?
Take a guess.
You need to get back to butting' in.
What if people never realize how much I help them.
That's the burden of being a hero.
I'm like batman.
Thank you, Gerald.
No, thank you.
Not many clients invite me back just to talk.
Yeah, about that--
See, um, there's a few tiles over there that are just a little uneven.
Oh, no.
My dad was right.
I'm useless.
- No.
It's my fault.
- How could it be your fault?
I don't know.
Just fix it, Gerald.
Got it.
Why is Kylie so mad?
Could be nothing.
Could be that she's pretending to be angry so she doesn't feel so guilty about being knocked up with someone else's kid.
That's comforting.
She's mad 'cause you fought to use my photo, not hers.
Women do love when men fight for them.
There is nothing less sexy than a dude who respects a restraining order.
That's a great story.
Look, Trav, it's all about effort.
There is no end to what a man must do for a woman.
Hey there, baby.
You don't look like you're from around here.
Are you lost, Ellie Torres?
What do you want?
Don't be rude.
I left my bathroom to come over here, and that's a big deal.
Well, you were right.
She asked for space.
I didn't expect to be right.
- Really?
- No, I-knew I would be..
Well, go ahead.
Gloat.
Later.
Now I'm here to apologize.
Scoot it.
See...
When you act like a pursey, you are just so not sexy.
Apology accepted.
I-I want you to be that edgy, aloof guy that I-I-I kind of find attractive.
But that's not for you, and it's not for Sara.
That's just for me, and...
Sorry.
I'm batman.
How can I still not understand what women want?
Women just want a guy who-- who respects our independence but also wants to take care of us.
We want a guy who's secure but also gets jealous.
We want a guy who truly listens to us but also wants us to kinda shut up.
Like yesterday, when you were being a little mean to me, but you weren't being too mean.
That was so hot.
Well, I know you want to tell me how to fix it with Sara,
So go ahead.
It's easy.
Just treat her like you treat me.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Sad Pants.
It sucks being a dude.
Women want an everything man.
Come on.
I'm in the mood for tacos.
Yeah, well, I'm kinda in the middle of something.
- But I'm hungry.
- Then why don't you run out and grab us some tacos and bring 'em back?
All right.
Run along.
Runnin' Runnin'
Runnin' just as fast as I can
Tryin' to be your everything man
Give me 20 minutes?
Please let me use your picture.
You want me all edgy, but there's always a hitch
I have to stay loyal when you act like a bitch
You want toughness and sweetness and softness and meanness wanna make me the master of this in-between-ness
Runnin', Runnin'
Runnin' just as fast as I can
I'm trying to be your everything man
Please be my
You know I'm gonna try
I can be your everything man
He's gonna be my everything man--an
She is way, way better than you.
- Shut up.
- That was fun.
Yeah, for you.
I carried your ass.
Bitch, please.
So you fixed him.
Are you happy?
I really don't know.
There's no scuffing the tiles.
Take your shoes off.
Booties in the bin.
- You need to leave this room.
- Not happening'.
- Andy, grab her feet.
- No!
No, I don't want to go!
I don't want to go!
- No!
- Jules, it's fine.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Let me at least just grab one of these fancy towels!
You don't need a towel.
I got two.
I got two.
I got 'em!
All right, toilet man.
I'm not afraid.
I am pressing that "No" Button.
Bring it.
Hell, yeah!
- Ooh!
Great shirt alert.
- Yeah?
No.
I just made up that phrase, "great shirt alert,"
and it's really fun to say.
Well, you should've said it to Andy.
I mean, come on.
- Great shirt alert.
- Yeah?
No.
I just wanted to try saying it.
Jules, you're right.
It's so fun!
I have had the worst writer's block.
This is the only song I've been able to come up with in the last three weeks.
* Writer's block, writer's block *
Hear that?
That's what your stupid songs sound like in my head!
Why do we still have to hang out here when your bathroom's being remodeled?
My kitchen is our hangout.
It's our turf.
It's our clubhouse.
Our... barrio.
Why did you teach her how to roll her "R"s?
Molly Ringwald.
I'm really sorry.
Oh, come on.
The construction's not that bad.
- We got to meet Gerald.
- This has been a great couple of weeks.
You guys really got me through some stuff.
We know your father's a tough cookie.
But just remember, all that yelling is just him showing you his love, you know?
- I do now.
- Who lays tile better than you?
No one.
I can do this.
- He's back.
- You go, Gerald!
Your dad was wrong about you!
His dad was not wrong.
But you do what you do for good tile.
Oh!
I can't wait for this bathroom to be done!
In fact, put it in your calendars, because I'm gonna have a bathroom warming party.
Can I bring Sara to what sounds like the worst party ever?
Oh!
You mean Sara, your new girlfriend?
Ooh!
That was embarrassing.
I thought you were all gonna do it.
Hey, where did you even find the space to put in a giant master bathroom?
Balls!
- I love you.
- Not happening.
What do you mean, "Not happening?" I'm not allowed to love you?
That "I love you" doesn't mean, "I love you," it means, "Let's have sex."
It doesn't this time.
Trust me.
It has been ten days since our one or our half.
Our half?
Come on.
It's your half.
- Yeah, it is.
- I admit, it's been too long, but I got sidelined by that UTI.
All right, react.
But now you want sex so badly that it's too much pressure.
- It makes me not want it.
- So you want me to not want it?
No, I want you to want it, but I don't want to know you want it.
- How will you know I want it?
- If I want it, you'll want it.
True.
OK.
We can do this.
- OK.
- All right.
Just give me my half!
Hey, thanks for doing this.
I can't believe your school makes you do photo projects.
It's like they cater to the weird, artsy-fartsy kids.
- I started the photography club.
- Cool.
Nice save.
All right, now this is all about stolen moments.
You just gotta pretend like I'm not here.
- Just do it, nerd!
- Hurtful.
OK, one, two, three.
Seriously?
If there's a camera around, we bring the sexy.
It's how we do.
Well, the camera would beg to differ.
- It's a devil camera!
- I'm a seal.
No posing, OK?
Just go sit on the bench and talk.
Oh, I know.
Why don't we play that game where we guess who's gonna die first?
- Laurie.
- Laurie.
You get defibrillated at a Kid Rock concert one time...
Well...
How do you feel about Grayson being in a real relationship?
I don't know.
I can't really be jealous because I never got in the game.
But honestly, it does kinda suck.
Shaboom!
A moment has been stolen.
Travis, let me see that.
I was sad.
That's not fair.
Oh!
Whoa!
I look hot when I'm depressed.
Oh!
That's why I always get hit on when I'm at funerals.
Oh, why can't someone die?
Stop it.
You're Jules, right?
I'm Sara.
- Oh.
Hi.
You're Grayson's...
- I am.
Have a seat.
Well, I'm just gonna dive right in.
You've got gorgeous hair.
It's like you hit your head on a rock, and honey is pouring out.
I just had it done for your bathroom party.
Twice.
Oh, I forgot.
You don't know me.
- I'm insane!
- No way!
Me, too.
Don't be nervous about tonight, OK?
'Cause it's totally casual.
Don't wear jeans, 'cause we're not animals.
OK, thanks.
Oh, I gotta run.
You know, you're as cool as Grayson said.
Peace.
"Peace?"
What kind of a skank wears a watch?
Nice try, Laurie, but I like her.
- Oh, you're serious.
- Yeah.
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?
- She let you kiss her that way?
- Yeah, Dad.
I lick her mouth.
Shabamy!
- I'm making out with a dog.
- Delete that.
Fine.
You might want to take some notes, junior.
Dog Travis has more game than you.
Look, I got it covered, all right?
Travis!
You just undid my bra!
Seriously?
I've got heated floors, a steam shower, flat screen and check out the tub.
It is so deep I can rent it out for water births.
Wow, Jules!
It's like a bathroom from a fairy tale!
I can totally picture a princess copping a squat in here.
We're in a bathroom.
Is that one of those electronic toilet seats from Japan?
- Mm-hmm!
- Holy gods, it cleans your hoo.
There are a lot more settings to figure out.
There's one button that just says, "No."
- I can't wait to push that.
- I'll bet.
The only downside is sometimes it yells at me in Japanese.
Hmm?
Wow, brace yourselves.
Grayson's on his way up with Sara.
- Oh, here we go.
- What?
Is he being more of a cocky jerk now that he has a girlfriend?
- Sort of the opposite.
- Sorry we're late.
Yeah, my little Sare Bear's tummy was growling, so we got a wittle num num.
- A wittle num num...
- Oh, no.
Let me take your purse.
Whoa!
What do you got in there, rocks?
I'm kidding, you.
Sha-moo!
Oh, that means "flush."
Yay!
Cougar Town 1x19
- Everything Man
Hey, sorry.
I'd love to stay, but the old ball and chain...
I'm kidding.
Bye, guys.
- Bye!
- See ya!
- Oh, no!
- Oh, my Lord!
Downright painful.
Did you see Grayson just standing there, holding Sara's purse?
I've got one better than, "Great shirt alert."
Grayson is totally "pursey-whipped."
That's good.
That is really gonna catch on.
Pursey-magnet.
Pursey-hound.
- Pursey-cat.
- That's not how it works.
- Maybe Grayson's just being careful...
- I'm sorry.
I just...
I really miss my bathroom.
Ah!
Yes.
Continue.
Maybe Grayson's just being careful because it's a new relationship.
They probably haven't even shaved each other yet.
I never got this whole Grayson thing, but now seeing him all weak and submissive, it's oh, so hot.
Come on.
- It makes him so unattractive.
- It's a total...
What?
It's the universal sign for lady turnoff.
No, it's not.
- He's gonna push Sara away.
- Wouldn't that make you happy?
I don't wanna watch a friend drown.
Plus, I like Sara.
She was so nice to me this morning when I ran into her.
I'm sorry I'm crying.
Your hair's so much nicer than mine.
I know.
Everything is.
- That never happened.
- That's how I remember it.
Why are you so into photography?
I feel like photos really capture our collective unconscious.
Plus, being pretentious really works on me.
You should work that angle in college.
Get yourself a scarf and watch the nerdy girls start throwing their legs open.
Yeah, I love Kylie.
Even though we're going to different colleges,
I think we're gonna stay together.
Are you done?
No.
Oh!
I really dig this one of Kylie kissing the dog.
Looks like an old Portuguese man and his mistress.
She won't let me use it.
I had to pretend I deleted it.
Art should never be compromised for the sake of vanity.
- Laurie, bring up coffee.
- We're working in my bathroom today.
She slept in there last night.
- Honey, you have a problem.
- I don't have a problem.
Are you planning on leaving the bathroom today?
No, no, no.
Not today.
So Ellie pulled the whole "to get sex more you have to want it less" thing?
Classic.
I can't handle it, man.
I'm not strong enough.
- Calm down, A-Team.
- You calm down!
Look, what you need to do is just picture Ellie with a bucket head.
- A bucket on her head?
- No, the bucket is her head.
How would that help?
You ever looked inside a bucket and not seen something disgusting?
Fish guts, dip, spit, dead rats.
That'll work.
- Sorry I yelled.
- Apology hug.
Ellie thinks our apology hugs are weird.
She's weird.
Apology accepted.
Still having writer's block?
* Tryin' to break it by singin' every word I say
Damn it!
I just got perfume all over my contracts.
That's it!
If I wanted to be a bathroom attendant,
I would have stayed a bathroom attendant.
- Good day.
- So...
* Why did you have me over?
I grabbed one of Travis's cameras because I wanted to show you some of the pictures that he's been taking of you and Sara.
Well, there you are, spoon-feeding her ice cream.
Brushing her glorious hair.
Sare Bear!
Grayson, you are acting like a total pursey.
- A?
- OK, look at this.
- You're painting her toenails.
- Whoa!
How did Travis get this picture?
That's in my bedroom.
- You enjoy your shower?
- Yeah.
Whoa!
Game on!
Yes!
Shabam!
Damn it, Andy.
For once I was coming to you, and you ruined it!
Your bucket was supposed to be filled with fish guts, but I looked inside, and it was nothing but sex.
- What?
- It was just an eighth of a second.
Can't we get that moment back?
It's all natural light.
Dude, a bucket head?
Really?
- Eh, I took a swing.
- Don't help anymore.
What you guys looking at?
I present to you the crown jewel of stolen moments.
Me butt naked.
Let me see that. 'Cause I'm gonna smash your camera.
- No, no, no.
- Give it!
Chill, EI, I've seen you nude.
I videotaped the birth of your child, for crying out loud.
At least here, you're not all, you know... inside out.
- No one's seeing that picture.
What about all the stuff you said about art being more important than vanity?
Oh, no.
How will I sleep at night?
Oh, right.
I have pills for that.
Are you really criticizing me for taking care of my girlfriend?
* I am *
OK, I hate myself, but you see how annoying that is?
I'm finally in a real relationship again.
I'm trying to really be in it.
OK?
Hell, you've been on me since the day we met to be more open and emotionally available.
But I didn't want you to become a lady butler.
- I'm not a lady butler.
- You're right.
You're not.
Because I've met a lady butler before, and see, they don't talk baby talk.
"Oh, Sare Bear, I love you so much.
It's like I don't have teeth no mo'."
Sara loves that I'm so into her.
No, she doesn't.
If you keep it up, you watch, she's gonna say she needs space and she'll start pulling away.
You don't know that.
- Shut up!
- Don't you yell at my toilet.
Look, I'm sorry that I found someone I care about.
I didn't realize it would make you so jealous.
I'm not jealous.
I'm happy for you.
I may not be expressing it with my tone right now, but I am.
If anybody's jealous, you're jealous of me and my bathroom.
So you are obviously insane, so I'll just say... back... the hell... off.
You said it.
Can you believe Grayson?
Jealous?
I'm not jealous.
You are a little jealous.
I know.
But he doesn't know that.
This is where your family hangs out now?
Yep.
Get comfortable.
Oh, no, no, no.
No.
We don't touch the towels in the special bathroom.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, sorry.
- Just don't do it again.
- Maybe with Grayson and Sara, it would be better to, you know... not butt in.
Yes, I meddle, but I do it because I know, ultimately, you're all grateful.
We are?
You sure about that?
Yes.
You love it that I care so much.
If Travis knew I was doing it, he'd thank me for trimming his hair while he's sleeping.
I knew it.
You know I want to grow it out.
Sweetie, it hides your pretty face.
Kylie!
Get your grubby paws off my towels!

You want me to back off?
OK, then guess what?
I'm out.
I will never meddle in your lives again.
You know what?
We'll see.
Everybody go.
Get out.
I'm gonna press Mr. Toilet Man's "No" button.
Go.
Hey, uh, Mrs. Torres?
No!
What are you doing to me?
!
Will you please change your mind about letting me use your picture?
No chance, Lance.
- Can you believe her?
- Travis, you're such an ass.
What just happened?
Never press the "No" button.
- Sorry it didn't work.
- Apology hug accepted.
So Ellie just dropped robe, and the bucket head just disappeared?
The bucket didn't disappear.
I'm sorry, my hot naked wife with a bucket head?
- I'm in.
- You just need to get to a place where there's no sexual desire left whatsoever.
I can probably do that if I spent a little private time with... you know, myself.

You gotta push.
It's a two-person effort.

You know, I was thinking maybe I might just crash at my place tonight.
- Just get a little space.
- Oh, yeah.

I just need to let people be.

Was it as beautiful as it was in my dreams?
Take a guess.
You need to get back to butting' in.

That's the burden of being a hero.
I'm like Batman.
- Thank you, Gerald.
- No, thank you.
Not many clients invite me back just to talk.
Yeah, about that...
See, there's a few tiles over there that are just a little uneven.
Oh, no.
My dad was right.
I'm useless.
- No.
It's my fault.
- How could it be your fault?
- I don't know.
Just fix it, Gerald.
- Got it.
- Why is Kylie so mad?
- Could be nothing.
Could be that she's pretending to be angry so she doesn't feel so guilty about being knocked up with someone else's kid.

There is no end to what a man must do for a woman.
Hey there, baby.
You don't look like you're from around here.
Are you lost, Ellie Torres?
Hey.
- What do you want?
- Don't be rude.
I left my bathroom to come over here, and that's a big deal.
Well, you were right.
She asked for space.
I didn't expect to be right.
- Really?
- No, I knew I would be.
Well, go ahead.
- Gloat.
- Later.
Now, I'm here to apologize.
Scoot it.
See...
When you act like a pursey, you are just so not sexy.
Apology accepted.
I want you to be that edgy, aloof guy that I kind of find attractive.
But that's not for you, and it's not for Sara.
That's just for me, and...
Sorry.
I'm Batman.
How can I still not understand what women want?

Please let me use your picture.
Wow.
She is way, way better than you.
- Shut up.
- That was fun.
Yeah, for you.
I carried your ass.
Bitch, please!
So you fixed him.
Are you happy?
I really don't know.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
There's no scuffing the tiles.
Take your shoes off.
Booties in the bin.
You need to leave this room.
Not happening'.
- Andy, grab her feet!
- No!
No, I don't want to go!
- I don't want to go!
No!
- Jules, it's time.
No, no, no!
Let me at least just grab one of these fancy towels!
- You don't need a towel!
- I got two.
- I got 'em!
- All right, Toilet Man.
I'm not afraid.
I am pressing that "No" button.
Bring it.
Whoo!
Hoo-hoo!
Hell, yeah!
Previously on Dance Academy...
Abigail, you could learn something by watching Tara.
It was surprisingly good.
Mum's trying to miss her plane.
Dad would freak if she did.
You think?
Mum moved us to Sydney to be near you, and you never visit.
I'm at the National Academy of Dance.
I have classes every day.
I don't know if you know, but my dad's a choreographer, which means that this whole thing, it's a lot more important than just the marks, yeah?
There's other pressures.
As soon as this room situation's cleaned up
I'm gonna spend more time with the boys, doing guy stuff.
We're gonna jump.
Arrgh!
Thanks for everything.
No-one's really tried that hard for me before.
Hey...
Can we just stop for a second?
It doesn't feel... right.
I have this recurring dream where I'm about to take the biggest exam of my life.
I open the booklet and realise I can't answer a single question.
All this time I've been studying the wrong subject.
It's like...
I thought I was on track.
I thought I knew what I was doing.
But actually, I...
I don't know anything at all.
Christian's never gonna speak to me again.
Why?
What are we...?
What are we doing?
My shoes are melting.
Look, if you can't keep up...
- Hold this, yeah?
- Yeah.
Hoh!
I did it!
Do it again.
I am Hendrix!
You wish.
Ah, bromance.
Ain't it grand?
Broken air-con should mean no classes.
It should mean wearing deodorant.
You can't call a band 'Free Beer'.
But imagine the poster.
You're in a good mood... again.
Yeah, we're getting a band together.
Wait.
You know that means playing actual instruments, right?
Auditions for the end-of-year production are tomorrow.
I'm teaching these 'Nutcracker' variations once.
I have a headache.
Pay attention.
As first-years you can expect to fill the corps de ballet.
On rare occasions, we might decide you're ready for a solo role.
Katrina, even though your father is directing 'The Nutcracker', it doesn't mean you are guaranteed anything.
Really?
Promise?
Katrina... seeing as you missed that run-through, you can rehearse with the boys.
And ready?
And...
Temps leve... glissade... cabriole.
Miss Raine, there'll be a lot of paperwork if I die of heat exhaustion.
Katrina, we are all hot, we are all uncomfortable, but we're here and we...
Sorry about that.
Oh...
Sweat!
Gross!
Use the resistance of the water.
It'll help you work the right muscles.
Arabesque.
Is this right, Patrick?
Good, Tara.
Rehab seems to have strengthened your technique.
Hey, Mum.
Seriously?
Do I have to?
I thought she had school.
What?
!
I think Chris is getting us some drinks or something.
You two are very chummy these days.
Do I have cause for jealousy?
Uh... maybe.
We made a pact of brotherhood.
Oh.
So... no more girls, no more break-ups, no more jumping when one of you snaps your pretty little fingers.
From now on, we are an Island of Men.
Aww, you have a guyfriend, just like you've always wanted.
Yeah, I have a mate.
It's just annoying that if anyone in our year gets a solo, it's gonna be Abigail.
Oh, my mum played Clara when she was in first year.
I'd love to play Clara.
Yep, and she never got over it.
Insisted on dancing it until she was 30.
I hate 'The Nutcracker'.
I'd be Flower Number Six if they wanted me to.
I'm just happy I can audition.
So how's your knee?
Is it alright?
Yeah, it's alright.
Gonna chuck us one of those drinks, bro?
How could she do this to me?
She knows auditions are tomorrow.
Where's Sammy?
He's busy.
We all are.
Sit down.
But we will see him tonight.
No, we won't.
Why?
Because.
Because why?
Because we broke up.
What did you do?
Excuse me?
I'm not discussing this with you.
It's so unfair.
Everyone's breaking up.
Everyone in the whole wide world.
Mum and Dad are.
Paige, that's not funny.
They are, and it's all your fault.
What went through my parents' minds when they made me do flute lessons?
How is that a life skill?
You could play bass.
Girls dig bass.
Not that that's a concern, right?
Island of Men.
Sorry.
Hey, this summer you should come stay at my place.
We can rehearse in the garage.
Yeah, I could...
I could teach you to surf.
Sweet.
Yeah, awesome.
You think your parents would really go for it?
I mean, this place gets a bit much over the holidays.
I think they don't have a choice.
Look, you're still 'golden boy', I am still 'child of concern'.
That's not gonna change.
Yeah, we'll see.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ciao.
Gattino...
Papa.
Ahh.
Mwah.
Mwah.
No wonder the company wanted to keep you, huh?
You've been working out.
A bit.
And now it's all for nothing.
We'll get to that.
Um, so maybe you could take a look at my reel at some point.
Course.
You're one of my main reasons for being here.
Oh, the thought of directing a student version of 'The Nutcracker' wasn't temptation enough?
The thought of keeping an eye on you two was certainly appealing.
There are some serious family discussions to be had.
How many more ways can he say, "I'm disappointed?"
Oh, well, welcome to my existence.
You must have misunderstood.
They fight on the phone and Dad hasn't been down to visit us for ages.
Paige, that's not the same thing as breaking up.
Push.
Harder.
Ouch!
Careful!
All you care about is ballet.
What do you want me to do, Paige?
Lock them up in a room and not let them out until they promise to stay together?
No, Abigail.
I want you to help.
I have to live there and you don't do anything except make it worse.
Meaning?
I'm not the reason Mum moved down here.
Dad's back home and he needs us...
I didn't ask anyone to do that.
Abigail, you HAVE to talk to them.
No, I HAVE to rehearse.
If they're splitting up because of me, may as well make it worthwhile.
Play.
The girl?
Tara Webster.
First year.
That's my best friend, Dad.
His muse, but my best friend.
And you've sent this to companies overseas looking for choreography work?
Yeah, I've been getting some positive responses.
I'm not surprised.
Your name alone would get you in through the front door.
But the work here...
doesn't stand up.
Right, well, I'm approaching some pretty cutting-edge places, Dad.
Your name wouldn't necessarily help me there these days.
Maybe it's not the right time for this.
I'm peckish, you're jet-lagged.
You should've taken the company's offer.
It would be years standing around in a corps doing other people's work when I'm ready to do my own.
Look!
A pirouette!
You guys love pirouettes!
At 18, you think you're ready to stand in front of a group of professional dancers and tell them what to do?
I said no to the company, Dad, so if you haven't got anything else to add...
Well, here's a proposition.
Don't audition for 'The Nutcracker'.
Come and work as my assistant.
See if you can cut it in a professional environment.
You know what?
I think it's too hot to eat.
Before I got to the Academy, I had this list of 'Whys?
'
"Why do I get anxious if I don't know where the nearest toilet is?"
"Why do I have three hairs on my chest and 18 on my big toe?"
"Why do I like taking those IQ tests on the Internet?"
"Why have I never been this happy?"
Great shot.
Your break.
Nuh.
No way.
I am hopeless.
I thought...
Oh, sorry, I thought we were playing.
Yeah, but Training Bra here needs a lesson.
Yeah.
OK, uh, what do I do?
Alright, hit the white ball.
Try and get it in...
Yeah, I'm done anyway, so I'll just leave you guys to it.
Yeah.
There you go.
So they don't know you know?
But you could come home and talk to them about it.
Tell them how we feel.
Hey, Mum.
Yep.
We're out the front.
Paige is ready.
Well, they said they're not giving solos to first-years but I'm doing everything I can to change that.
Yeah.
I know.
Well, it's not like the competition stands a chance.
OK.
Can I sit, or will that be breaking the rules of brotherhood?
Already broken.
He's in there with Tara.
You know, if they get back together, we are entitled to lodge an objection.
How many times can they put us through that?
So... you and Christian have been hanging out a lot lately.
It'd be totally understandable if you'd developed, say... a crush.
On who?
Tara?
Christian.
Like... a man-crush, or whatever.
I don't have a crush on Christian, Kat.
Hey, I've had girl-crushes before.
It doesn't have to mean anything.
Come on.
You are an evolved specimen, Samuel.
We can talk about this.
Can we change the subject?
OK, so, I have a couple of casting suggestions that I wanna run past you and a few staging ideas as well.
I think there are some pretty exciting places we can take this.
Great.
I need you to photocopy these schedules.
Now would be a good time, Ethan.
Um... sure.
So... 'Nutcracker'.
Are you ready to fight the mice?
Dad, really, do you have to?
I'll never forget it, that's all.
Your mother was playing Clara, it was a battle scene, you were...
Three, and I ran onstage to save her.
You stopped the whole performance.
You stole the show.
And I knew right there and then that you were born to be on the stage too.
See, that's why I'm not worried about you.
I get it.
You felt the need to push the boundaries this year, but I know that next year you'll be ready to work.
I've been pushing the boundaries because I've been unhappy here, Dad.
Then why haven't you left?
Wasn't aware that I actually had a choice.
Oh, come on, kitten, ever since you've been three years old you've done whatever you wanted to.
I get that you wanna rebel against your parents, but you belong here.
The sooner you start accepting that, the better.
I am not one of your teachers.
I'm not interested in school politics, what year you're in, or your attendances.
I am a choreographer.
I am looking for dancers.
All that matters is how well you perform, and how... how focused you are...
So incredibly sorry.
And how professional you prove to be.
Let's get started, shall we?
You OK, Tara?
Um... yeah.
I'm fine.
My knee's fine.
Can you go on?
You bet.
From the manèges?
- Great.
So...
- I reckon.
It'd be really good.
Your cue, Kat.
Uh... sorry.
Are you OK?
Yeah, I think so.
Everyone...
Dad...
Hey!
How did you go?
How do you think?
So?
Killed it.
OK, this is bad.
It's like I'm back in the exam room and suddenly I don't know anything.
There's a whole list of 'Whys?
' that have never even crossed my mind before.
You OK?
Yeah.
They're now staring me in the face.
Some of us are about to head to the pool.
You gonna come?
Yes.
Yeah.
The problem is, once I let these questions out, there's no going back.
I was just standing there and I was really thinking,
"Any moment now I am going to dance,"
and then suddenly my legs were walking me out of the studio.
Like I had absolutely no control over what my body was doing...
Christian's never gonna speak to me again.
Why?
Because you were right.
Sammy, a man-crush isn't the end of the world.
What if it's more than that?
Mum...
I got the Snowflake solo.
I know.
It's so technically demanding.
Hey, listen... do you think I could come over tonight?
Paige and I really need to talk to you about something.
It's not like what I had with Abigail was nothing, OK?
That was real.
Yeah, of course.
Things have just been so intense since the court sentencing.
Yep.
Sure.
And when you're living with someone, in that close proximity, it's textbook that stuff gets... confused, you know?
Uh-huh.
Yes, yes.
All of that too.
And maybe you just like him, Sammy.
Audition walkout?
How could you not tell me?
Um... it wasn't really planned.
You OK?
Mm.
So far.
I am the Mouse King.
Mate, that's awesome.
Cast list.
Check yours.
Soldier Number Two and...
Boy at the Party.
Oh, yay!
What about you?
Bah-bow.
What?
Nothing?
I was late, I fell, I just wasn't good enough.
Hey, can I grab you for a sec?
Look, you don't have to explain.
We can't say anything until the doctor signs off on your knee, so this has to stay inside the vault.
You're dancing Clara.
What?
Hope you're ready for your life to change.
The capital is safer now than it has ever been.
There's nothing to do.
I'm inert.
- So, what have you got for me?
- Something gruesome.
But you know what we've got here, don't you?
Another copy cat.
A crazed Kray fan.
- Who's he?
- Stephen Dukes.
This is out of control.
Needs to be reigned in.
Know about his background?
Ask him about his father.
- Miles?
- Ask him about
- Freddie "The Dip".
- This isn't part of a crime ring with villains resurrected from the 60s.
The legend promises that one day Ron and Reg will return.
- Resurrected.
- I'm not afraid of ghosts.
I am.
He's obviously not...
I've never seen him before.
What do you think?
I think you're gonna need another whiteboard.
This is exactly the same as in 1966.
Ronnie Kray was thirsting for blood.
George Cornell was sitting right there drinking a light ale when Ronnie came in and shot him in the head.
Our victim was a lager man.
Close enough.
Two warning shots fired to clear everyone out and this man gets a bullet in the head.
The only witness to the Cornell murder in '66 was the barmaid.
And she went into witness protection.
They can't get her.
So, what did Billy Bunhill do 40 years ago to deserve this?
And who waits that long to take revenge?
Barmaid so everything
- but wouldn't talk.
- A stroll through history!
She wouldn't talk to me but she said she'd talk to you.
Look, I saw Jimmy Kray, all right?
Jimmy Kray shot him.
What are you waiting for?
He only lives round the corner!
Move into position.
OK.
Go!
Compromised.
Compromised.
Don't just stand their gawping.
Jimmy's expecting ya.
You are the builder who fixed the ceiling in the incident room!
How's your boy?
Still got a sore arse, has he?
- Arrest him and get him out of here.
- Hang on.
Gotta say my goodbyes first.
Be back in time for dinner, love.
OK?
Come on.
Gentlemen.
He was here all night so whatever you think he did, he didn't.
Jimmy Kray.
Come on.
Everyone knows there aren't any more Krays.
They're all dead.
- He's a Kray all right.
- Every time I do the Karaoke,
I call myself Elvis.
But it don't make me the King.
I can prove it.
I used to write to Ronnie Kray when he was in prison.
He invited me to visit him so
I did for a couple of years.
Then one day he was talking about how he wanted an heir.
A son to carry on the legend.
I offered to help.
Ronnie Kray was a misogynistic homosexual who thought all women were dirty.
How could you get pregnant?
Because he'd kept a deposit in a special type of bank.
If you know what I mean.
And I made a withdrawal.
There's no father's name.
Because the father has to be present to register the birth.
He could hardly do that from prison, could he?
You had Ronnie Kray's son and no-one knew until now?
I had to keep it a secret till they was old enough to look after themselves.
On account of people like you.
And others that would see harm done to 'em.
Themselves?
How many Krays did you have?
Just my twins.
Two perfect boys.
- You believe her story?
- Well, yeah.
The legend said there was a sperm bank.
Storing the legacy of Ron and Reg waiting for the day.
It was a scary bedtime story for little kids of East End.
You had a panic attack when you thought it was a copy cat.
You're fine with they being real Krays, are you?
I'd rather die a lion than live like a mouse.
Really?
Well, not the dying part, obviously.
But you know what I mean.
Jimmy and Johnny Kray.
- What a pair.
- What do you know about them?
They surfaced recently swearing they are Ronnie Kray's sons.
Promising to take back the East End but it's all bluff.
They're just trading on their father's name.
So they are genuine Krays?
The real thing?
Real in body but not in spirit.
Jimmy and Johnny Kray are only interested in the glamour of the gangster lifestyle.
They are celebrity offspring who lack the talent and wit of their father.
I have a witness who says Jimmy shot a man dead.
A witness who is probably £50 richer for giving you Jimmy's name.
Why would anyone pay a witness to say they committed murder?
Because... when you are as useless as Jimmy and Johnny Kray, the only thing you can steal is credit.
If they can get arrested for murder, it makes them look good.
You won't be able to charge and they'll walk free
- but with bigger reputations.
- No.
They are their father's sons.
And they are revenging him.
They attacked one of my detectives and infiltrated my offices.
They've turned half the uniforms against me.
I'm not the kind of man who starts a fight but I won't walk away from one.
You're making them into what they want to be.
You're falling for the fantasy they've created.
Be careful, Joe.
Your career won't survive another error of judgement.
He's not leaving that cell let alone this station!
I mean, look at you in your tailored suit and gold watch!
It's clear what you are in this business for.
You are holding my client without basis.
- He should be released.
- To cause more mayhem?
!
More murders for us to mop up?
!
- Calm down before you hurt yourself.
- Mr. Jimmy Kray's solicitor.
And I believe that he should be released immediately.
- Why would we do that?
- Because my client is an identical twin.
I defy any one to tell one brother from the other and yet to arrest my client on the basis of an hysterical woman hiding behind the bar crying.
She does not know whether she saw Jimmy Kray,
Johnny Kray or Mickey Mouse.
Jimmy shot a man in front of her.
- She knows what she saw.
- Really?
Then, why not ask her to tell them apart?
- Fine.
We shall.
- And if she can't, you will concede you do not know who committed the crime and you will free my client.
Kent.
We weren't expecting you back so soon.
I heard you made an arrest.
I wanna see who did this to me.
Now remember.
This ain't a line-up.
All you have to do is look at Jimmy and Johnny Kray.
- And pick Jimmy.
- Yeah.
The one that shot Billy Bunhill.
Right?
Two perfect boys.
She couldn't do it.
I couldn't tell 'em apart.
- I don't think their mother can.
- So that's it?
- They're free?
- If our only witness is unreliable, we can't hold them.
This way, boys.
Come on, Jimmy.
You'll never be this lucky again.
Consider this a war, gentlemen!
A war?
Oh, we love ourselves a war,
- don't we, Johnny?
- Oh, we do.
We do.
This liver's all scar tissue.
Mr. Bunhill was quite the drinker.
The bullet's gone to ballistics.
So I'll let you know what they find.
It'll be from a Luger.
Ronnie's favourite gun.
Is there any DNA to prove which twin was responsible?
Well, no.
Twins are basically two halves of the same person.
So not only do they look the same but they share the same DNA.
Forensics can't help us, then?
No, I'm afraid not.
You'll have to do this one the old-fashioned way.
Witnesses.
Confessions.
And luck.
Jimmy and Johnny Kray are prime suspects in the murder of Lennie Cobb, Slasher Daneford and Billy Bunhill.
What about Stephen Dukes?
Dukes is no longer of primary interest.
Now Lennie Cobb and Slasher Daneford were witnesses against Ron and Reg Kray.
Their deaths were revenge.
Billy Bunhill...
We haven't found the link between him and Ronnie and Reggie yet.
There's a reason why he was shot.
We just need find out.
This board is blank.
I want to know everything there is to know about Jimmy and Johnny Kray.
Who they're friends, associates, business interests.
I want it all, down to the smallest detail, in the next 48 hours.
The builder who fixed the ceiling was Jimmy, Johnny or both.
How would they have got in?
The job would have been put out to tender.
Then it would have been authorised.
But nothing happens without forms filled in triplicate.
Follow the paper trail.
See whose signature is on it.
Yes, sir.
Ed.
Ed.
It's me.
Joe.
I can see you, Ed.
Open the door.
- Are you alone?
- Yes.
- Were you followed?
- No.
Now let me in.
This is ridiculous.
Quickly!
They may have a bead on you.
Not much to offer you by the way of sustenance, I'm afraid.
Haven't been out to the shops much since Slasher's murder.
Mum has some fruit teas.
Past their sell-by.
- It's all a bit last resort here now.
- I'm fine.
- Have you thought about opening a window?
- No!
No, I'm staying away from the windows.
I'm not answering the phone either.
These people are killers.
I can't be too careful.
I'm sure they have no interest in harming you.
I was warned!
They gave me Slasher's lighter to show they know who I am.
I can't be part of this investigation any more!
I quit!
It's over for me.
If the Krays have a hit list, I've put myself at the top of it.
You must try and relax.
This is all I have by way of research on the Krays.
I had to swat up for the documentary and all my notes are there.
Take it.
I'm washing my hands of it all.
The detective who caught the Krays, Nipper Read, said it was attention to detail that was the key to making the arrests.
I'm willing to bet you already have the answer you just haven't realised it yet.
You must look at everything again very... very closely.
The key is there.
Not another word from me.
Ever.
Thanks.
You know, a gang is like any other business.
You start at the bottom and you work your way up to the top.
You can't just walk in and be chief executive.
They have the Kray name, I'm sure opened doors.
Still.
It's a closed world.
Invitation only.
Someone will have vouched for those boys when they were coming up.
You mean like Dickie Morgan did for Ronnie and Reggie?
Yeah.
The King maker.
It's a good idea.
Put it on the board.
Legibly.
Hello, son.
How are you?
You on the mend?
Yeah, I'm much better thanks.
That's great.
How can I help you?
What do you need?
An ergonomic chair?
- I can request that for you.
- No, thanks.
I'm looking for the records on the builder who did the work in the incident room.
- What?
The leaky roof?
- Yes, who hired him, that sort things.
Bad job, was it?
These things are put out for tender, you know.
You get the cheapest which is not always the best.
No authorisation form.
No invoice either.
Must have got lost in the system.
It'll turn up sooner or later.
I'll put a flag on it.
All right.
Thanks.
I'll see you in a few days.
Weeks more like.
You look after yourself.
Out of the way, lads.
Cheers.
You leave him alone.
That paperwork'll never turn up.
Hello.
No.
Here.
Have a look at this.
No.
Found something, boss!
- What have you got?
- I've found something that proves
Jimmy and Johnny Kray are managing directors of Multiple Investments.
Here's a list of the business they own.
Looks like chinese restaurants.
Some Turkish places in Green Lanes.
- And a Russian tea room.
- All these business is their front.
For what?
Ronnie Kray wanted to create the federation of crime.
The idea was to have all the gangs working together instead of competing one with an other.
They pool expertise and their combined strength would make them unstoppable.
What we have is the new federation of crime.
Look, all these restaurants represent a gang... the Russians, Triads, Turkish.
All under the control of Jimmy and Johnny Kray.
They're on their way to realising their father's dream.
What's on your mind?
I was just thinking.
When my dad disappeared.
If it'd been investigated properly, we may have found out what happened to the bugger.
He just wasn't important enough.
What are you doing?
- Now get in the car.
- You can't just take me.
Go!
DI Chandler.
You made it.
Please.
I'm Johnny.
This is my brother Jimmy.
What do you want?
Well, we need to come to an understanding.
An accommodation.
You know.
This is a small town.
And we all need to learn to get along.
Stop stepping on each other's toes.
What do you suggest?
Me and my brother are businessmen.
We work with the local community and we'd... like to continue to grow our business.
And you will carry on being a policeman.
- That's what I am doing.
- But you're the wrong sort of policeman.
Oh.
You mean the sort who investigates you.
I'm afraid I'm the kind of man who doesn't care what people think.
I'm the one who marches out of time.
So...
So even if you get every police in London in line, you won't get me.
Well, you've made your point perfectly clear.
Now I'm gonna make mine.
Disappear.
- Take a holiday.
- Or what?
You're not gonna play funny buggers with us, are you?
Well, get him out of here.
How mad is he?
Mad enough to shoot a man for sitting on the wrong bar stool.
Billy Bunhill was a total innocent.
A nobody.
- He was just unlucky.
- Wait.
Before we go any further,
I need to you register as a covert intelligence source.
I don't think so.
I am a snout.
And that is all, officially, there is to know.
Well, I'm afraid I can't use you.
Or have anything more to do with you.
This investigation has to be complete by the book.
That's a shame.
For you.
- I was gonna tell you about the Congo.
- What?
Why?
What's in the bloody Congo?
Mercenaries.
- I have a job for you.
- I made myself clear.
Go away!
Come on, Ed.
It's urgent.
I need you to find out about Miles's father Freddie "The Dip".
Nothing is more important than finding the truth.
Do not tempt me.
You'll be safe.
You'll only have to worry about the ghosts.
Come on, Ed.
This is the siren call of detection, remember?
Boss, we've looked.
But we can't find anything to connect Billy Bunhill to the Krays.
- Ever.
Nothing.
- And you won't find anything.
Billy Bunhill was a random bloke who fancied a pint and sat on the wrong bar stool.
When Jimmy walked in, he was gonna shoot whoever was sitting on that stool because that is where George Cornell sat.
- That's all motive.
- The motive wasn't revenge
- like the others?
- It was madness.
I had a meeting with Jimmy and Johnny.
Are you serious?
I think Johnny is relatively normal.
He's the businessman.
He wants to run the Federation of Crime.
Keep things quiet.
But Jimmy's completely insane.
- Like father like son.
- When Ronnie went paranoid, the murder count shot up.
He called himself "The Colonel"
and plotted to eliminate his enemies.
It's been made clear to me that we are the enemies now.
Jimmy and Johnny spent time in the Congo as mercenaries.
Find out when, for how long and who they fought with.
I'll start straightaway.
Get on the ball, Liam!
Give a go, Liam!
Give a go!
- Good boy.
- He's got a good left foot.
Yeah, it's not bad.
He's not consistent, though.
He's got natural ability.
Yeah.
Maybe.
Had a bit of interest of the clubs.
Really?
Which one is your son?
Oh, I haven't got a boy here.
I've just come to have a good look at yours.
- Are you a scout?
- No.
Who are you, then?
I'm the man that'll break Liam's legs if you don't behave.
Liam.
Sorry, ref.
You'll have to get a sub on.
He's coming with me.
Come on.
I'll get you home.
Oi!
McCormack!
You.
You did this?
You were told to go on holiday but you didn't.
I made sure they didn't kill you.
Here.
You can't afford to lose this war.
- What is this?
- Ammunition
Think of it as you're last stand.
Now shall I show you how to get out of here?
I just wanted to ask you.
How did you become "Mad Danny The Disposer"?
I had a big boot on my car.
I wasn't squeamish either.
So it just sort of fell to me.
I wasn't killing no-one.
I was a kind of... caretaker.
Where did you take the bodies?
I liked to use woods.
Pig farms.
I like working in the countryside.
- Pig farms?
- Yeah.
I'd chop the body up.
Joint it really.
Freeze it then put the parts through a wood chipper.
You get a good slurry you can feed to the pigs.
They love it.
Why did you freeze them?
It's practical.
Cuts down on the splatter.
I've been asking around all my old contacts but people seem very reluctant to talk this time.
It ain't reluctant.
Nobody knows.
Hardly anyone knows what happened to Freddie The Dip.
But you know something.
Right?
Well, I know that Ron invited Freddie to go fishing.
Freddie thought he was being stepped up.
When they got there,
- Ron had him shot in the head.
- Why?
- Why would he do such a thing?
- I don't know.
I never asked.
You should talk to the man who pulled the trigger.
But you better hurry.
His days are numbered.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
Was being clean up.
So gone.
- Burglary in a police station?
- And you?
I was ambushed.
- Woke up in Epping Forest.
- You're lucky to come back alive.
That's where Ronnie and Reggie disposed of bodies.
Anyone sent a message last night?
They threatened my family.
- Are they OK?
- I sent them away last night.
Judy's in bits.
I had a gun pointed at me.
Well, I didn't get threatened.
I did get a bunch of flowers.
- A lucky horseshoe.
- That was a wreath.
You were looking at it upsidedown.
- How about you?
- No.
Nothing.
Clean slate.
- Fresh start.
- Great!
Where do we start?
With this.
I've got to go and change my clothes first.
Lord Hessel.
Sorry to turn up unannounced.
I'm DI Chandler.
This is DS Miles.
You'd better have a damn good reason for this or I'll have you back in uniform patrolling estates in a week.
Actually, I have half a dozen excellent reasons.
Well, you can't prove that's me.
- Oh, hell's bells!
- Good God, man!
Do you know how many laws you are breaking in that picture?
Look, the thing is, I...
I didn't know they were gangsters to begin with.
We were introduced.
We had drinks.
And before I knew they were threatening me.
Blackmail?
My own mistake.
Obviously.
An indiscretion which placed me in their power.
And I am not alone.
They are on all sides of the house.
I need your testimony.
Enough to arrest, charge and bring this to an end.
I can guarantee your anonymity.
Even your wife won't know.
Do you really think my word is going to be enough to stop them?
You're a peer of the realm.
A good place to start.
I know it's irregular for the
Crown Prosecution Service to do this, but if Jimmy and Johnny Kray find out people are talking, they'll have them killed.
We want to guarantee our witnesses' anonymity and keep their statements sealed and confidential until the trial.
Many witnesses will be criminals so we require discretion to overlook minor crimes.
Didn't the police make the same arrangement in 1967?
Nipper Read did, yes.
It was the only way he could bring the case to trial.
Funny how history repeats itself.
I'm sure we can draw up an agreement.
Thanks for coming.
All you need now... is a witness to get the ball rolling.
- We have one.
- Really?
Must be a brave man or someone desperate for revenge.
He's being blackmailed.
The quality of a witness really matters in court.
I hope for your sake your man is of good standing.
- He's a peer.
- Excellent.
That'll play well with the jury.
This calls for a small celebration.
Are you buying?
I'll get dolled up.
- DI Chandler?
- That's me.
Can I help you?
Yes.
I'm from the CPS.
We have a meeting.
- Well, an hour ago.
- I'm sorry.
My tyres were slashed.
And then and then someone stole my mobile.
I had to bus it from Acton.
We just had a CPS lawyer here called Wayland.
No, you couldn't have.
I'm Wayland.
Then who the hell were we just talking to?
Hey!
You!
- Stop!
- They never stop!
Get your car!
My car.
Where's my car?
Well, I ain't chasing him on that.
So it's true?
You shot Freddie Miles?
None of us ever refused Ron anything.
But Freddie did.
He...
He had to.
And he paid the price for it.
- But he didn't deserve to die.
- No.
You can take it to the grave or you can make it right.
Make your peace.
I did what I was told.
It didn't matter if I agreed with it or not.
But I can't carry it any more.
Bless you.
Bless you.
Lord Hessel has had a change of heart.
- He won't talk.
- I know.
Are you OK?
I-I-I know how this looks.
I just get a bit OCD sometimes.
It's just something I do when I'm under stress.
I'm not crazy.
There's nothing wrong with me.
I can do the job.
If tidying eases your stress, come round to my house.
I think there might be a reason for our bad luck.
Last night, when everyone was intimidated and this place ransacked,
Kent... was working here on his own... and nothing happened to him.
I asked him to look into who hired the builder and he found nothing about.
I asked him to contact the Congo about about what Jimmy and Johnny Kray
- got up to out there.
- And he found nothing.
Hello.
Tell me I'm wrong.
He's just a kid.
And they hurt him badly.
I almost can't blame him.
- You want me to tell him?
- No.
No, he should hear it from me.
Put the phone down.
- I've got a lead on the Congo.
- Put the phone down and... pack your things.
Sir?
You're suspended pending an investigation.
Go home.
You think I'm a mole.
Out of everyone, I really wish it hadn't been you.
- May I...er...?
- I'd rather you didn't.
Well, I have some results to show you.
- I saw young Kent in tears.
- Yes.
I know.
Crying.
Next to a donkey.
- I know.
- Didn't see your car anywhere.
Please, I'm totally aware of my current situation.
It's like we're cursed.
I can't trust anybody around me and the only person helping me is a villain.
Who's the villain?
He's part of Jimmy and Johnny's firm.
He's also a double agent working for me.
I'd be wary of accepting help.
Back in the '60s, there was a man called Alan Cooper who worked for the Krays as an armourer.
He provided them with bombs and guns.
But what they didn't realise is that he was working for the head of the murder squad, John Du Rose
I am being wary.
But If it wasn't for his leads, this investigation would have stalled a long time ago.
Alan Cooper also worked for the US State Department.
He was a man of shadows.
You need to find out who else your man is working for.
Because... perhaps he could be from the dark side too.
If I don't use him, I've got nothing except the past.
I've been over every detail of this case like you said.
But I still don't see how you can use history to catch the Krays.
OK.
We must free our minds and rely on instincts and intuitions.
Anything is possible.
Let us detect.
Please.
We can hardly pluck the answer from thin air.
Ronnie and Reggie Kray were tried together.
Now, in my opinion, this would never happen again.
Ronnie was insane and not fit to stand trial and Reggie should have argued he was coerced into murder by Ronnie by his brother.
Yes, but they refused to betray one another.
Exactly.
They remained inside until they died.
But no-one would want to repeat that bit of history.
That's it.
Divide and conquer.
I want you to set up a meeting between me and Johnny Kray.
- Just Johnny.
- What makes you think
Johnny wants to betray Jimmy?
I'm sure he doesn't want to spend 30 years in prison.
- They're twins.
- But they're not alike any more, are they?
Just talk to Johnny.
Johnny'll be in touch.
He'll send someone to contact one of us.
Driving a wedge between the twins is a good idea.
- Bold.
- Buchan.
Oh, Jesus!
I'll keep my fingers crossed then.
- You're the messenger?
- Yeah.
Well, they don't give you a choice.
- Miles?
- Carpenter's Arms.
- Do you know it?
- I'll find it.
- Where is he, then?
- He's on his way.
Yeah, well...
Johnny won't give him a second chance.
He'll be here.
Come on!
Cheers.
- He's bottled it.
- Any second now.
So this is your revenge, is it?
Swapping sides?
Putting me back in uniform meant I lost a lot of pay.
I had to make up the mortgage somehow.
An open bar and you choose that?
I couldn't see any tea making facilities.
Do you want ice?
Someone's looking after you, then.
Someone in high places.
That's all I know.
Where's Fitz?
I can't hear a heartbeat.
Wait a minute.
He's wearing...
He's wearing body armour!
You bastard!
Come on.
Wake up!
You knew this was an ambush!
You KNEW we could have got killed!
What do you want me to do, eh?
Die with you?
!
- I got family.
- Yeah.
So have I!
You are under arrest.
You are the only person in the world who is trying to stop them.
The only one who doesn't get it.
So go on.
Arrest me.
Come on!
You're on borrowed time.
DI Chandler.
You're a dead man.
As of now, consider the Krays allies rather than targets.
What they got on you?
Money?
Sex?
What is it?
You've been drinking.
You're not fit to lead any enquiry.
See anything you like?
itfc subtitles
What do you think?
I think you're gonna need another whiteboard.
This is exactly the same as in 1966.
Ronnie Kray was thirsting for blood.
George Cornell was sitting right there drinking a light ale when Ronnie came in and shot him in the head.
Our victim was a lager man.
Two warning shots fired to clear everyone out and he gets a bullet in the head.
The only witness to the Cornell murder in '66 was the barmaid.
And she went into witness protection.
They can't get her.
What did Billy Bunhill do 40 years ago to deserve this?
And who waits that long to take revenge?
Barmaid so everything but wouldn't talk.
A stroll through history!
She wouldn't talk to me but she said she'd talk to you.
Look, I saw Jimmy Kray, all right?
Jimmy Kray shot him.
What are you waiting for?
He only lives round the corner!
Move into position.
OK.
Go!
Compromised.
Compromised.
Don't just stand their gawping.
Jimmy's expecting ya.
The builder who fixed the ceiling in the incident room!
How's your boy?
Still got a sore arse, has he?
Arrest him and get him out of here.
Hang on.
Gotta say my goodbyes.
Be back in time for dinner, love.
OK?
Come on.
Gentlemen.
He was here all night so whatever you think he did, he didn't.
Jimmy Kray.
Come on.
Everyone knows there aren't any more Krays.
They're all dead.
He's a Kray all right.
Every time I do the Karaoke, I call myself Elvis.
But it don't make me the King.
I can prove it.
I used to write to Ronnie Kray when he was in prison.
He invited me to visit him so I did for a couple of years.
Then one day he was talking about how he wanted an heir.
A son to carry on the legend.
I offered to help.
Ronnie Kray was a misogynistic homosexual who thought all women were dirty.
How could you get pregnant?
Because he'd kept a deposit in a special type of bank.
If you know what I mean.
And I made a withdrawal.
There's no father's name.
Because the father has to be present to register the birth.
He could hardly do that from prison, could he?
You had Ronnie Kray's son and no-one knew until now?
I had to keep it a secret till they was old enough to look after themselves.
On account of people like you.
And others that would see harm done to 'em.
Themselves?
How many Krays did you have?
Just my twins.
Two perfect boys.
You believe her story?
Yeah.
The legend said there was a sperm bank.
Storing the legacy of Ron and Reg waiting for the day.
It was a scary bedtime story for East End kids.
You had a panic attack when you thought it was a copy cat.
You're fine with it being the real Krays.
I'd rather die a lion than live like a mouse.
Really?
Well, not the dying part.
But you know what I mean.
Jimmy and Johnny Kray.
What a pair.
What do you know about them?
They surfaced recently swearing they are Ronnie Kray's sons.
Promising to take back the East End but it's all bluff.
They're just trading on their father's name.
So they are genuine?
The real thing?
Real in body but not in spirit.
Jimmy and Johnny Kray are only interested in the glamour of the gangster lifestyle.
They are celebrity offspring who lack the talent and wit of their father.
I have a witness who says Jimmy shot a man dead.
A witness who is probably £50 richer for giving you Jimmy's name.
Why would anyone pay a witness to say they committed murder?
When you are as useless as Jimmy and Johnny Kray, the only thing you can steal is credit.
If they can get arrested for murder, it makes them look good.
You won't be able to charge and they'll walk free but with bigger reputations.
No.
They ARE their father's sons.
And they are revenging him.
They attacked one of my detectives and infiltrated my offices.
They've turned half the uniforms against me.
I'm not the kind of man who starts a fight but I won't walk away from one.
You're making them into what they want to be.
You're falling for the fantasy they've created.
Be careful, Joe.
Your career won't survive another error of judgement.
He's not leaving that cell let alone this station!
I mean, look at you in your tailored suit and gold watch!
It's clear what you are in this business for.
You are holding my client without basis.
He should be released.
To cause more mayhem?
!
More murders for us to mop up?
!
Calm down before you hurt yourself.
Jimmy Kray's solicitor.
And I believe that he should be released immediately.
Why would we do that?
My client is an identical twin.
I defy any one to tell one brother from the other and yet to arrest my client on the basis of an hysterical woman hiding behind the bar crying.
She does not know whether she saw Jimmy Kray, Johnny Kray or Mickey Mouse.
Jimmy shot a man in front of her.
She knows what she saw.
Really?
Why not ask her to tell them apart?
Fine.
We shall.
If she can't, you will concede you do not know who committed the crime and you will free my client.
(GROANS)
Kent.
We weren't expecting you back so soon.
I heard you made an arrest.
I wanna see who did this to me.
Now remember.
This ain't a line-up.
All you have to do is look at Jimmy and Johnny Kray.
And pick Jimmy.
Yeah.
The one that shot Billy Bunhill.
Right?
ANGIE'S VOICE:
Two perfect boys.
She couldn't do it.
I couldn't tell 'em apart.
I don't think their mother can.
So that's it?
They're free?
If our only witness is unreliable, we can't hold them.
This way, boys.
Come on, Jimmy.
You'll never be this lucky again.
Consider this a war, gentlemen!
A war?
Oh, we love ourselves a war, don't we, Johnny?
Oh, we do.
We do.
This liver's all scar tissue.
Mr Bunhill was quite the drinker.
The bullet's gone to ballistics.
I'll let you know.
It'll be from a Luger.
Ronnie's favourite gun.
Is there any DNA to prove which twin was responsible?
Well, no.
Twins are basically two halves of the same person.
So not only do they look the same but they share the same DNA.
Forensics can't help us, then?
I'm afraid not.
You'll have to do this one the old-fashioned way.
Witnesses.
Confessions.
And luck.
Jimmy and Johnny Kray are prime suspects in the murder of Lennie Cobb, Slasher Daneford and Billy Bunhill.
What about Stephen Dukes?
Dukes is no longer of primary interest.
Now Lennie Cobb and Slasher Daneford were witnesses against Ron and Reg.
Their deaths were revenge.
Billy Bunhill...
We haven't found the link between him and Ronnie and Reggie.
There's a reason why he was shot.
This board is blank.
I want to know everything there is to know about Jimmy and Johnny - friends, associates, business interests.
I want it all, down to the smallest detail, in the next 48 hours.
The builder who fixed the ceiling was Jimmy, Johnny or both.
How would they have got in?
The job would have been put out to tender.
Then it would have been authorised.
Nothing happens without forms filled in triplicate.
Follow the paper trail.
See whose signature is on it.
Sir.
Ed.
Ed.
It's me.
Joe.
I can see you, Ed.
Open the door.
Are you alone?
Yes.
Were you followed?
No.
Now let me in.
This is ridiculous.
Quickly!
They may have a bead on you.
Not much to offer you by the way of sustenance, I'm afraid.
Haven't been out to the shops much since Slasher's murder.
Mum has some fruit teas.
Past their sell-by.
It's all a bit last resort here now.
I'm fine.
Have you thought about opening a window?
No!
No, I'm staying away from the windows.
I'm not answering the phone either.
These people are killers.
I can't be too careful.
I'm sure they have no interest in harming you.
I was warned!
They gave me Slasher's lighter to show they know who I am.
I can't be part of this investigation any more!
I quit!
It's over for me.
If the Krays have a hit list, I've put myself at the top of it.
You must try and relax.
This is all I have by way of research on the Krays.
I had to swat up for the documentary and all my notes are there.
Take it.
I'm washing my hands of it all.
The detective who caught the Krays, Nipper Read, said it was attention to detail that was the key to making the arrests.
I'm willing to bet you already have the answer you just haven't realised it yet.
You must look at everything again very...
VERY closely.
The key is there.
Ha!
Not another word from me.
Ever.
(KETTLE WHISTLES ON HOB)
Thanks.
You know, a gang is like any other business.
You start at the bottom and you work your way up to the top.
You can't just walk in and be chief executive.
I'm sure the Kray name opened doors.
Still.
It's a closed world.
Invitation only.
Someone will have vouched for those boys when they were coming up.
Like Dickie Morgan did for Ronnie and Reggie?
Yeah.
The King maker.
It's a good idea.
Put it on the board.
Legibly.
Hello, son.
How are you?
You on the mend?
Yeah, I'm much better thanks.
That's great.
How can I help you?
What do you need?
An ergonomic chair?
I can request that for you.
No, thanks.
I'm looking for the records on the builder who did the work in the incident room.
The leaky roof?
Stuff like who hired him.
Bad job, was it?
These things are put out for tender, you know.
You get the cheapest which is not always the best.
(THE OFFICERS AT THE DOOR WHISPER)
No authorisation form.
No invoice either.
Must have got lost in the system.
It'll turn up sooner or later.
I'll put a flag on it.
All right.
Thanks.
I'll see you in a few days.
Weeks more like.
You look after yourself.
Out of the way, lads.
Cheers.
You leave him alone.
That paperwork'll never turn up.
(PHONE RINGS)
Hello.
No.
Here.
Have a look at this.
No.
Found something, boss!
What have you got?
I've found something that proves
Jimmy and Johnny Kray are managing directors of Multiple Investments.
Here's a list of the business they own.
Chinese restaurants.
Some Turkish places in Green Lanes.
And a Russian tea room.
All these are a front.
For what?
Ronnie Kray wanted to create the federation of crime.
The idea was to have all the gangs working together instead of competing.
They pool expertise and their combined strength would make them unstoppable.
What we have is the new federation of crime.
All these restaurants represent a gang - the Russians, Triads, Turkish.
All under the control of Jimmy and Johnny Kray.
They're on their way to realising their father's dream.
What's on your mind?
I was just thinking.
When my dad disappeared.
If it'd been investigated properly, we may have found out what happened.
He just wasn't important enough.
(TUBE TRAIN SCREECHES PAST)
(UNLOCKS CAR REMOTELY)
(ENGINE REVS)
What are you doing?
Now get in the car.
You can't just take me.
Go!
Hm.
DI Chandler.
You made it.
Please.
I'm Johnny.
This is my brother Jimmy.
What do you want?
Well, we need to come to an understanding.
An accommodation.
You know.
This is a small town.
And we all need to learn to get along.
Stop stepping on each other's toes.
What do you suggest?
Me and my brother are businessmen.
We work with the local community and we'd like to continue to grow our business.
And you will carry on being a policeman.
That's what I am doing.
But you're the wrong sort of policeman.
Oh.
You mean the sort who investigates you.
(SLURPS HIS DRINK)
I'm afraid I'm the kind of man who doesn't care what people think.
I'm the one who marches out of time.
So even if you get every police in London in line, you won't get me.
Well, you've made your point perfectly clear.
Now I'm gonna make mine.
Disappear.
(JIMMY RUSTLES HIS SPENT EGG)
Take a holiday.
Or what?
Sssh-ssh!
You're not gonna play funny buggers with us, are you?
Well, get him out of here.
How mad is he?
Mad enough to shoot a man for sitting on the wrong bar stool.
Billy Bunhill was a total innocent.
A nobody.
He was just unlucky.
Wait.
Before we go any further,
I need to you register as a covert intelligence source.
I don't think so.
I am a snout.
And that is all, officially, there is to know.
Well, I'm afraid I can't use you.
Or have anything more to do with you.
This investigation has to be by the book.
That's a shame.
For you.
I was gonna tell you about the Congo.
What?
Why?
What's in the bloody Congo?
Mercenaries.
I have a job for you.
I made myself clear.
Go away!
Come on, Ed.
It's urgent.
(DOOR UNBOLTS)
I need you to find out about Miles's father Freddie The Dip.
Nothing is more important than finding the truth.
Do not tempt me.
You'll be safe.
You'll only have to worry about the ghosts.
Come on.
This is the siren call of detection, remember?
Boss, we've looked.
But we can't find anything to connect Billy Bunhill to the Krays.
Ever.
Nothing.
And you won't find anything.
Billy Bunhill was a random bloke who fancied a pint and sat on the wrong bar stool.
When Jimmy walked in, he was gonna shoot whoever was there because that is where George Cornell sat.
The motive wasn't revenge like the others?
It was madness.
I had a meeting with Jimmy and Johnny.
Are you serious?
I think Johnny is relatively normal.
He's the businessman.
He wants to run the Federation of Crime.
But Jimmy's completely insane.
Like father like son.
When Ronnie went paranoid, the murder count shot up.
He called himself The Colonel and plotted to eliminate his enemies.
It's been made clear to me that we are the enemies now.
Jimmy and Johnny spent time in the Congo as mercenaries.
Find out when, for how long and who they fought with.
I'll start straightaway.
Get on the ball, Liam!
Give a go, Liam!
Give a go!
Good boy.
He's got a good left foot.
Yeah, it's not bad.
He's not consistent, though.
He's got natural ability.
Yeah.
Maybe.
Had a bit of interest of the clubs.
Really?
Which one is your son?
Oh, I haven't got a boy here.
I've just come to have a good look at yours.
What are you?
A scout?
No.
Who are you, then?
I'm the man that'll break Liam's legs if you don't behave.
Liam.
Sorry, ref.
You'll have to get a sub on.
He's coming with me.
Come on.
I'll get you home.

You can't afford to lose this war.

Ammunition
Think of it as you're last stand.
Now... ..shall I show you how to get out of here?
I just wanted to ask you.
How did you become Mad Danny The Disposer?
I had a big boot on my car.
I wasn't squeamish either.
So it just sort of fell to me.
I wasn't killing no-one.
I was a kind of... caretaker.

It ain't reluctant.
Nobody knows.
Hardly anyone knows what happened to Freddie The Dip.
You do.
(CLEARS THROAT) Well, I know that Ron invited Freddie to go fishing.
Freddie thought he was being stepped up.
When they got there, Ron had him shot in the head.
Why?
Why would he do such a thing?
I don't know.
I never asked.
You should talk to the man who pulled the trigger.
But you better hurry.
His days are numbered.
What happened?
I don't know.
It's all gone.
Burglary in a police station?
And you?
I was ambushed.
Woke up in Epping Forest.
You're lucky to be alive.
That's where Ronnie and Reggie disposed of bodies.
Anyone sent a message last night?
They threatened my family.
Are they OK?
I sent them away last night.
Judy's in bits.
I had a gun pointed at me.
Well, I didn't get threatened.
I did get a bunch of flowers.
A lucky horseshoe.
That was a wreath.
You were looking at it upsidedown.
How about you?
No.
Nothing.
Clean slate.
Fresh start.
Great (!
) Where DO we start?
With this.
I've got to go and change my clothes first.
Lord Hessel.
Sorry to turn up unannounced.
I'm DI Chandler.
This is DS Miles.
You'd better have a damn good reason for this or I'll have you back in uniform patrolling estates in a week.
Actually, I have half a dozen excellent reasons.
Well, you can't prove that's me.
Oh, hell's bells!
Do you know how many laws you are breaking in that picture?
Look, the thing is, I didn't know they were gangsters to begin with.
We were introduced.
We had drinks.
And before I knew they were threatening me.
Blackmail?
My own mistake.
Obviously.
An indiscretion which placed me in their power.
And I am not alone.
They are on all sides of the house.
I need your testimony.
Enough to arrest, charge and bring this to an end.
I can guarantee your anonymity.
Even your wife won't know.
Do you really think my word is going to be enough to stop them?
You're a peer of the realm.
A good place to start.
I know it's irregular for the Crown Prosecution Service to do this, but if Jimmy and Johnny Kray find out people are talking, they'll have them killed.
We want to guarantee our witnesses' anonymity and keep their statements sealed and confidential until the trial.
Many witnesses will be criminals so we require discretion to overlook minor crimes.
Didn't the police make the same arrangement in 1967?
Nipper Read did.
It was the only way he could bring the case to trial.
Funny how history repeats itself.
I'm sure we can draw up an agreement.
Thanks for coming.
All you need is a witness to get the ball rolling.
We have one.
Really?
Must be a brave man or someone desperate for revenge.
He's being blackmailed.
The quality of a witness really matters in court.
I hope for your sake your man is of good standing.
He's a peer.
Excellent.
That'll play well with the jury.
This calls for a small celebration.
Are you buying?
I'll get dolled up.
DI Chandler?
That's me.
Can I help you?
Yes.
I'm from the CPS.
We have a meeting.
Well, an hour ago.
I'm sorry.
My tyres were slashed.
And then someone stole my mobile.
I had to bus it from Acton.
We just had a CPS lawyer here called Wayland.
No, you couldn't have.
I'm Wayland.
Then who the hell were we just talking to?
HEY!
YOU!
Stop!
They never stop!
Get your car!
My car.
Where's my car?
Well, I ain't chasing him on that.
So it's true?
You shot Freddie Miles?
None of us ever refused Ron anything.
But Freddie did.
He...
He had to.
And he paid the price for it.
(COUGHS)
But he didn't deserve to die.
No.
You can take it to the grave or you can make it right.
Make your peace.
I did what I was told.
It didn't matter if I agreed with it or not.
But... ..I can't carry it any more.
Bless you.
Bless you.
..19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29... 30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40
41,42,43,44,45,46,47... 48,49,50... 51,52,53,54,55,56... 57...
Er...57
58,59,60... 61,62,63,64,65,66,67...
Lord Hessel has had a change of heart.
He won't talk.
I know.
Are you OK?
I know how this looks.
I just get a bit OCD sometimes.
It's just something I do when I'm under stress.
I'm not crazy.
There's nothing wrong with me.
I can do the job.
If tidying eases your stress, come round to my house.
I think there might be a reason for our bad luck.
Last night, when everyone was intimidated and this place ransacked,
Kent was working here on his own...
and nothing happened to him.
I asked him to look into who hired the builder and he found nothing.
I asked him to contact the Congo about what Jimmy and Johnny Kray got up to out there.
And he found nothing.
Hello.
Tell me I'm wrong.
He's just a kid.
And they hurt him badly.
I almost can't blame him.
You want me to tell him?
No.
No, he should hear it from me.
Put the phone down.
I've got a lead on the Congo.
Put the phone down and pack your things.
Sir?
You're suspended pending an investigation.
Go home.
You think I'm a mole.
Out of everyone, I really wish it hadn't been you.
(FIGHTS BACK THE ANGUISH)
26,27,28,29... (BUCHAN RAPS ON DOOR)
May I...er...?
I'd rather you didn't.
Oh.
Well, I have some results to show you.
I saw young Kent in tears.
Yes.
I know.
Crying.
Next to a donkey.
I know.
Didn't see your car anywhere.
I'm totally aware of my current situation.
It's like we're cursed.
I can't trust anybody around me and the only person helping me is a villain.
Who's the villain?
He's part of Jimmy and Johnny's firm.
He's also a double agent working for me.
I'd be wary of accepting help.
Back in the '60s, there was a man called Alan Cooper who worked for the Krays as an armourer.
He provided them with bombs and guns.
What they didn't realise is that he was working for the head of the murder squad, John Du Rose.
I am being wary.
If it wasn't for his leads, this investigation would have stalled.
Alan Cooper also worked for the US State Department.
He was a man of shadows.
You need to find out who else your man is working for.
Perhaps he could be from the dark side too.
If I don't use him, I've got nothing except the past.
I've been over every detail like you said.
I still don't see how you can use history to catch the Krays.
(EXHALES IN EXASPERATION) OK.
We must free our minds and rely on instincts and intuitions.
Anything is possible.
Let us detect.
Please.
We can hardly pluck the answer from thin air.
Tusk!
Tusk!
Ronnie and Reggie Kray were tried together.
In my opinion, this would never happen again.
Ronnie was insane and not fit to stand trial and Reggie should have argued he was coerced into murder by Ronnie.
Yes, but they refused to betray one another.
Exactly.
They remained inside until they died.
But no-one would want to repeat that bit of history.
That's it.
Divide and conquer.
I want you to set up a meeting between me and Johnny Kray.
Just Johnny.
What makes you think Johnny wants to betray Jimmy?
He doesn't want to spend 30 years in prison.
They're twins.
But they're not alike any more, are they?
Just talk to Johnny.
Johnny'll be in touch.
He'll send someone to contact one of us.
Driving a wedge between the twins is a good idea.
Bold.
Buchan's.
Oh, Jesus!
I'll keep my fingers crossed then.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
You're the messenger?
Yeah.
Well, they don't give you a choice.
(MOBILE TRILLS) Miles?
Carpenter's Arms.
Do you know it?
I'll find it.
Where is he, then?
He's on his way.
Yeah, well...
Johnny won't give him a second chance.
He'll be here.
Come on!
Cheers.
He's bottled it.
Any second now.
So this is your revenge, is it?
Swapping sides?
Putting me back in uniform meant I lost a lot of pay.
I had to make up the mortgage somehow.
Humpf.
An open bar and you choose that?
I couldn't see any tea making facilities.
Do you want ice?
Someone's looking after you, then.
Someone in high places.
That's all I know.
Where's Fitz?
I can't hear a heartbeat.
Wait a minute.
He's wearing...
He's wearing body armour!
You bastard!
Come on.
Wake up!
You knew this was an ambush!
You KNEW we could have got killed!
What do you want me to do, eh?
Die with you?
!
I got family.
Yeah.
So have I!
You are under arrest.
You are the only person in the world who is trying to stop them.
The only one who doesn't get it.
So go on.
Arrest me.
Come on!
You're on borrowed time.
DI Chandler.
You're a dead man.
As of now, consider the Krays allies rather than targets.
What they got on you?
Money?
Sex?
What is it?
You've been drinking.
You're not fit to lead any enquiry.
See anything you like?
The capital is safer now than it has ever been.
There's nothing to do.
I'm inert.
So, what have you got for me?
Something gruesome.
But you know what we've got here, don't you?
Another copy cat.
A crazed Kray fan.
Who's he?
Stephen Dukes.
This is out of control.
Needs to be reigned in.
(SWISH OF BLADE) Argh!
Know about his background?
Ask him about his father.
Miles?
Ask him about Freddie The Dip.
This isn't part of a crime ring with villains resurrected from the 60s.
The legend promises that one day Ron and Reg will return.
Resurrected.
I'm not afraid of ghosts.
I am.
(THE BUZZ OF CHATTER)
# MANFRED MANN:
Pretty Flamingo
He's obviously not...
I've never seen him before.
What do you think?
I think you're gonna need another whiteboard.
This is exactly the same as in 1966.
Ronnie Kray was thirsting for blood.
George Cornell was sitting right there drinking a light ale when Ronnie came in and shot him in the head.
Our victim was a lager man.
Two warning shots fired to clear everyone out and he gets a bullet in the head.
The only witness to the Cornell murder in '66 was the barmaid.
And she went into witness protection.
They can't get her.
What did Billy Bunhill do 40 years ago to deserve this?
And who waits that long to take revenge?
Barmaid so everything but wouldn't talk.
A stroll through history!
She wouldn't talk to me but she said she'd talk to you.
Look, I saw Jimmy Kray, all right?
Jimmy Kray shot him.
What are you waiting for?
He only lives round the corner!
Move into position.
OK.
Go!
Compromised.
Compromised.
Don't just stand their gawping.
Jimmy's expecting ya.
The builder who fixed the ceiling in the incident room!
How's your boy?
Still got a sore arse, has he?
Arrest him and get him out of here.
Hang on.
Gotta say my goodbyes.
Be back in time for dinner, love.
OK?
Come on.
Gentlemen.
He was here all night so whatever you think he did, he didn't.
Jimmy Kray.
Come on.
Everyone knows there aren't any more Krays.
They're all dead.
He's a Kray all right.
Every time I do the Karaoke, I call myself Elvis.
But it don't make me the King.
I can prove it.
I used to write to Ronnie Kray when he was in prison.
He invited me to visit him so I did for a couple of years.
Then one day he was talking about how he wanted an heir.
A son to carry on the legend.
I offered to help.
Ronnie Kray was a misogynistic homosexual who thought all women were dirty.
How could you get pregnant?
Because he'd kept a deposit in a special type of bank.
If you know what I mean.
And I made a withdrawal.
There's no father's name.
Because the father has to be present to register the birth.
He could hardly do that from prison, could he?
You had Ronnie Kray's son and no-one knew until now?
I had to keep it a secret till they was old enough to look after themselves.
On account of people like you.
And others that would see harm done to 'em.
Themselves?
How many Krays did you have?
Just my twins.
Two perfect boys.
You believe her story?
Yeah.
The legend said there was a sperm bank.
Storing the legacy of Ron and Reg waiting for the day.
It was a scary bedtime story for East End kids.
You had a panic attack when you thought it was a copy cat.
You're fine with it being the real Krays.
I'd rather die a lion than live like a mouse.
Really?
Well, not the dying part.
But you know what I mean.
Jimmy and Johnny Kray.
What a pair.
What do you know about them?
They surfaced recently swearing they are Ronnie Kray's sons.
Promising to take back the East End but it's all bluff.
They're just trading on their father's name.
So they are genuine?
The real thing?
Real in body but not in spirit.
Jimmy and Johnny Kray are only interested in the glamour of the gangster lifestyle.
They are celebrity offspring who lack the talent and wit of their father.
I have a witness who says Jimmy shot a man dead.
A witness who is probably £50 richer for giving you Jimmy's name.
Why would anyone pay a witness to say they committed murder?
When you are as useless as Jimmy and Johnny Kray, the only thing you can steal is credit.
If they can get arrested for murder, it makes them look good.
You won't be able to charge and they'll walk free but with bigger reputations.
No.
They ARE their father's sons.
And they are revenging him.
They attacked one of my detectives and infiltrated my offices.
They've turned half the uniforms against me.
I'm not the kind of man who starts a fight but I won't walk away from one.
You're making them into what they want to be.
You're falling for the fantasy they've created.
Be careful, Joe.
Your career won't survive another error of judgement.
He's not leaving that cell let alone this station!
I mean, look at you in your tailored suit and gold watch!
It's clear what you are in this business for.
You are holding my client without basis.
He should be released.
To cause more mayhem?
!
More murders for us to mop up?
!
Calm down before you hurt yourself.
Jimmy Kray's solicitor.
And I believe that he should be released immediately.
Why would we do that?
My client is an identical twin.
I defy any one to tell one brother from the other and yet to arrest my client on the basis of an hysterical woman hiding behind the bar crying.
She does not know whether she saw Jimmy Kray, Johnny Kray or Mickey Mouse.
Jimmy shot a man in front of her.
She knows what she saw.
Really?
Why not ask her to tell them apart?
Fine.
We shall.
If she can't, you will concede you do not know who committed the crime and you will free my client.
(GROANS)
Kent.
We weren't expecting you back so soon.
I heard you made an arrest.
I wanna see who did this to me.
Now remember.
This ain't a line-up.
All you have to do is look at Jimmy and Johnny Kray.
And pick Jimmy.
Yeah.
The one that shot Billy Bunhill.
Right?
ANGIE'S VOICE:
Two perfect boys.
She couldn't do it.
I couldn't tell 'em apart.
I don't think their mother can.
So that's it?
They're free?
If our only witness is unreliable, we can't hold them.
This way, boys.
Come on, Jimmy.
You'll never be this lucky again.
Consider this a war, gentlemen!
A war?
Oh, we love ourselves a war, don't we, Johnny?
Oh, we do.
We do.
This liver's all scar tissue.
Mr Bunhill was quite the drinker.
The bullet's gone to ballistics.
I'll let you know.
It'll be from a Luger.
Ronnie's favourite gun.
Is there any DNA to prove which twin was responsible?
Well, no.
Twins are basically two halves of the same person.
So not only do they look the same but they share the same DNA.
Forensics can't help us, then?
I'm afraid not.
You'll have to do this one the old-fashioned way.
Witnesses.
Confessions.
And luck.
Jimmy and Johnny Kray are prime suspects in the murder of Lennie Cobb, Slasher Daneford and Billy Bunhill.
What about Stephen Dukes?
Dukes is no longer of primary interest.
Now Lennie Cobb and Slasher Daneford were witnesses against Ron and Reg.
Their deaths were revenge.
Billy Bunhill...
We haven't found the link between him and Ronnie and Reggie.
There's a reason why he was shot.
This board is blank.
I want to know everything there is to know about Jimmy and Johnny - friends, associates, business interests.
I want it all, down to the smallest detail, in the next 48 hours.
The builder who fixed the ceiling was Jimmy, Johnny or both.
How would they have got in?
The job would have been put out to tender.
Then it would have been authorised.
Nothing happens without forms filled in triplicate.
Follow the paper trail.
See whose signature is on it.
Sir.
Ed.
Ed.
It's me.
Joe.
I can see you, Ed.
Open the door.
Are you alone?
Yes.
Were you followed?
No.
Now let me in.
This is ridiculous.
Quickly!
They may have a bead on you.
Not much to offer you by the way of sustenance, I'm afraid.
Haven't been out to the shops much since Slasher's murder.
Mum has some fruit teas.
Past their sell-by.
It's all a bit last resort here now.
I'm fine.
Have you thought about opening a window?
No!
No, I'm staying away from the windows.
I'm not answering the phone either.
These people are killers.
I can't be too careful.
I'm sure they have no interest in harming you.
I was warned!
They gave me Slasher's lighter to show they know who I am.
I can't be part of this investigation any more!
I quit!
It's over for me.
If the Krays have a hit list, I've put myself at the top of it.
You must try and relax.
This is all I have by way of research on the Krays.
I had to swat up for the documentary and all my notes are there.
Take it.
I'm washing my hands of it all.
The detective who caught the Krays, Nipper Read, said it was attention to detail that was the key to making the arrests.
I'm willing to bet you already have the answer you just haven't realised it yet.
You must look at everything again very...
VERY closely.
The key is there.
Ha!
Not another word from me.
Ever.
(KETTLE WHISTLES ON HOB)
Thanks.
You know, a gang is like any other business.
You start at the bottom and you work your way up to the top.
You can't just walk in and be chief executive.
I'm sure the Kray name opened doors.
Still.
It's a closed world.
Invitation only.
Someone will have vouched for those boys when they were coming up.
Like Dickie Morgan did for Ronnie and Reggie?
Yeah.
The King maker.
It's a good idea.
Put it on the board.
Legibly.
Hello, son.
How are you?
You on the mend?
Yeah, I'm much better thanks.
That's great.
How can I help you?
What do you need?
An ergonomic chair?
I can request that for you.
No, thanks.
I'm looking for the records on the builder who did the work in the incident room.
The leaky roof?
Stuff like who hired him.
Bad job, was it?
These things are put out for tender, you know.
You get the cheapest which is not always the best.
(THE OFFICERS AT THE DOOR WHISPER)
No authorisation form.
No invoice either.
Must have got lost in the system.
It'll turn up sooner or later.
I'll put a flag on it.
All right.
Thanks.
I'll see you in a few days.
Weeks more like.
You look after yourself.
Out of the way, lads.
Cheers.
You leave him alone.
That paperwork'll never turn up.
(PHONE RINGS)
Hello.
No.
Here.
Have a look at this.
No.
Found something, boss!
What have you got?
I've found something that proves
Jimmy and Johnny Kray are managing directors of Multiple Investments.
Here's a list of the business they own.
Chinese restaurants.
Some Turkish places in Green Lanes.
And a Russian tea room.
All these are a front.
For what?
Ronnie Kray wanted to create the federation of crime.
The idea was to have all the gangs working together instead of competing.
They pool expertise and their combined strength would make them unstoppable.
What we have is the new federation of crime.
All these restaurants represent a gang - the Russians, Triads, Turkish.
All under the control of Jimmy and Johnny Kray.
They're on their way to realising their father's dream.
What's on your mind?
I was just thinking.
When my dad disappeared.
If it'd been investigated properly, we may have found out what happened.
He just wasn't important enough.
(TUBE TRAIN SCREECHES PAST)
(UNLOCKS CAR REMOTELY)
(ENGINE REVS)
What are you doing?
Now get in the car.
You can't just take me.
Go!
Hm.
DI Chandler.
You made it.
Please.
I'm Johnny.
This is my brother Jimmy.
What do you want?
Well, we need to come to an understanding.
An accommodation.
You know.
This is a small town.
And we all need to learn to get along.
Stop stepping on each other's toes.
What do you suggest?
Me and my brother are businessmen.
We work with the local community and we'd like to continue to grow our business.
And you will carry on being a policeman.
That's what I am doing.
But you're the wrong sort of policeman.
Oh.
You mean the sort who investigates you.
(SLURPS HIS DRINK)
I'm afraid I'm the kind of man who doesn't care what people think.
I'm the one who marches out of time.
So even if you get every police in London in line, you won't get me.
Well, you've made your point perfectly clear.
Now I'm gonna make mine.
Disappear.
(JIMMY RUSTLES HIS SPENT EGG)
Take a holiday.
Or what?
Sssh-ssh!
You're not gonna play funny buggers with us, are you?
Well, get him out of here.
How mad is he?
Mad enough to shoot a man for sitting on the wrong bar stool.
Billy Bunhill was a total innocent.
A nobody.
He was just unlucky.
Wait.
Before we go any further,
I need to you register as a covert intelligence source.
I don't think so.
I am a snout.
And that is all, officially, there is to know.
Well, I'm afraid I can't use you.
Or have anything more to do with you.
This investigation has to be by the book.
That's a shame.
For you.
I was gonna tell you about the Congo.
What?
Why?
What's in the bloody Congo?
Mercenaries.
I have a job for you.
I made myself clear.
Go away!
Come on, Ed.
It's urgent.
(DOOR UNBOLTS)
I need you to find out about Miles's father Freddie The Dip.
Nothing is more important than finding the truth.
Do not tempt me.
You'll be safe.
You'll only have to worry about the ghosts.
Come on.
This is the siren call of detection, remember?
Boss, we've looked.
But we can't find anything to connect Billy Bunhill to the Krays.
Ever.
Nothing.
And you won't find anything.
Billy Bunhill was a random bloke who fancied a pint and sat on the wrong bar stool.
When Jimmy walked in, he was gonna shoot whoever was there because that is where George Cornell sat.
The motive wasn't revenge like the others?
It was madness.
I had a meeting with Jimmy and Johnny.
Are you serious?
I think Johnny is relatively normal.
He's the businessman.
He wants to run the Federation of Crime.
But Jimmy's completely insane.
Like father like son.
When Ronnie went paranoid, the murder count shot up.
He called himself The Colonel and plotted to eliminate his enemies.
It's been made clear to me that we are the enemies now.
Jimmy and Johnny spent time in the Congo as mercenaries.
Find out when, for how long and who they fought with.
I'll start straightaway.
Get on the ball, Liam!
Give a go, Liam!
Give a go!
Good boy.
He's got a good left foot.
Yeah, it's not bad.
He's not consistent, though.
He's got natural ability.
Yeah.
Maybe.
Had a bit of interest of the clubs.
Really?
Which one is your son?
Oh, I haven't got a boy here.
I've just come to have a good look at yours.
What are you?
A scout?
No.
Who are you, then?
I'm the man that'll break Liam's legs if you don't behave.
Liam.
Sorry, ref.
You'll have to get a sub on.
He's coming with me.
Come on.
I'll get you home.

Ammunition
Think of it as you're last stand.
Now... ..shall I show you how to get out of here?
I just wanted to ask you.
How did you become Mad Danny The Disposer?
I had a big boot on my car.
I wasn't squeamish either.
So it just sort of fell to me.
I wasn't killing no-one.
I was a kind of... caretaker.
Where did you take the bodies?
I liked to use woods.
Pig farms.
I like working in the countryside.
Pig farms?
Yeah.
I'd chop the body up.
Joint it really.
Freeze it then put the parts through a wood chipper.
You get a good slurry you can feed to the pigs.
They love it.
Why did you freeze them?
It's practical.
Cuts down on the splatter.
I've been asking around all my old contacts but people seem very reluctant to talk this time.
It ain't reluctant.
Nobody knows.
Hardly anyone knows what happened to Freddie The Dip.
You do.
(CLEARS THROAT) Well, I know that Ron invited Freddie to go fishing.
Freddie thought he was being stepped up.
When they got there, Ron had him shot in the head.
Why?
Why would he do such a thing?
I don't know.
I never asked.
You should talk to the man who pulled the trigger.
But you better hurry.
His days are numbered.
What happened?
I don't know.
It's all gone.
Burglary in a police station?
And you?
I was ambushed.
Woke up in Epping Forest.
You're lucky to be alive.
That's where Ronnie and Reggie disposed of bodies.
Anyone sent a message last night?
They threatened my family.
Are they OK?
I sent them away last night.
Judy's in bits.
I had a gun pointed at me.
Well, I didn't get threatened.
I did get a bunch of flowers.

That was a wreath.
You were looking at it upsidedown.

No.

You'd better have a damn good reason for this or I'll have you back in uniform patrolling estates in a week.
Actually, I have half a dozen excellent reasons.
Well, you can't prove that's me.
Oh, hell's bells!
Do you know how many laws you are breaking in that picture?
Look, the thing is, I didn't know they were gangsters to begin with.
We were introduced.
We had drinks.
And before I knew they were threatening me.
Blackmail?
My own mistake.
Obviously.
An indiscretion which placed me in their power.
And I am not alone.
They are on all sides of the house.
I need your testimony.
Enough to arrest, charge and bring this to an end.
I can guarantee your anonymity.
Even your wife won't know.
Do you really think my word is going to be enough to stop them?
You're a peer of the realm.
A good place to start.
I know it's irregular for the Crown Prosecution Service to do this, but if Jimmy and Johnny Kray find out people are talking, they'll have them killed.
We want to guarantee our witnesses' anonymity and keep their statements sealed and confidential until the trial.
Many witnesses will be criminals so we require discretion to overlook minor crimes.
Didn't the police make the same arrangement in 1967?
Nipper Read did.
It was the only way he could bring the case to trial.
Funny how history repeats itself.
I'm sure we can draw up an agreement.
Thanks for coming.
All you need is a witness to get the ball rolling.
We have one.
Really?
Must be a brave man or someone desperate for revenge.
He's being blackmailed.
The quality of a witness really matters in court.
I hope for your sake your man is of good standing.
He's a peer.
Excellent.
That'll play well with the jury.
This calls for a small celebration.
Are you buying?
I'll get dolled up.
DI Chandler?
That's me.
Can I help you?
Yes.
I'm from the CPS.
We have a meeting.
Well, an hour ago.
I'm sorry.
My tyres were slashed.
And then someone stole my mobile.
I had to bus it from Acton.
We just had a CPS lawyer here called Wayland.
No, you couldn't have.
I'm Wayland.
Then who the hell were we just talking to?
HEY!
YOU!
Stop!
They never stop!
Get your car!
My car.
Where's my car?
Well, I ain't chasing him on that.
So it's true?
You shot Freddie Miles?
None of us ever refused Ron anything.
But Freddie did.
He...
He had to.
And he paid the price for it.
(COUGHS)
But he didn't deserve to die.
No.
You can take it to the grave or you can make it right.
Make your peace.
I did what I was told.
It didn't matter if I agreed with it or not.
But... ..I can't carry it any more.
Bless you.
Bless you.
..19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29... 30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40
41,42,43,44,45,46,47... 48,49,50... 51,52,53,54,55,56... 57...
Er...57
58,59,60... 61,62,63,64,65,66,67...
Lord Hessel has had a change of heart.
He won't talk.
I know.
Are you OK?
I know how this looks.
I just get a bit OCD sometimes.
It's just something I do when I'm under stress.
I'm not crazy.
There's nothing wrong with me.
I can do the job.
If tidying eases your stress, come round to my house.
I think there might be a reason for our bad luck.
Last night, when everyone was intimidated and this place ransacked,
Kent was working here on his own...
and nothing happened to him.
I asked him to look into who hired the builder and he found nothing.
I asked him to contact the Congo about what Jimmy and Johnny Kray got up to out there.
And he found nothing.
Hello.
Tell me I'm wrong.
He's just a kid.
And they hurt him badly.
I almost can't blame him.
You want me to tell him?
No.
No, he should hear it from me.
Put the phone down.
I've got a lead on the Congo.
Put the phone down and pack your things.
Sir?
You're suspended pending an investigation.
Go home.
You think I'm a mole.
Out of everyone, I really wish it hadn't been you.
(FIGHTS BACK THE ANGUISH)
26,27,28,29... (BUCHAN RAPS ON DOOR)
May I...er...?
I'd rather you didn't.
Oh.
Well, I have some results to show you.
I saw young Kent in tears.
Yes.
I know.
Crying.
Next to a donkey.
I know.
Didn't see your car anywhere.
I'm totally aware of my current situation.
It's like we're cursed.
I can't trust anybody around me and the only person helping me is a villain.
Who's the villain?
He's part of Jimmy and Johnny's firm.
He's also a double agent working for me.
I'd be wary of accepting help.
Back in the '60s, there was a man called Alan Cooper who worked for the Krays as an armourer.
He provided them with bombs and guns.
What they didn't realise is that he was working for the head of the murder squad, John Du Rose.
I am being wary.
If it wasn't for his leads, this investigation would have stalled.
Alan Cooper also worked for the US State Department.
He was a man of shadows.
You need to find out who else your man is working for.
Perhaps he could be from the dark side too.
If I don't use him, I've got nothing except the past.
I've been over every detail like you said.
I still don't see how you can use history to catch the Krays.
(EXHALES IN EXASPERATION) OK.
We must free our minds and rely on instincts and intuitions.
Anything is possible.
Let us detect.
Please.
We can hardly pluck the answer from thin air.
Tusk!
Tusk!
Ronnie and Reggie Kray were tried together.
In my opinion, this would never happen again.
Ronnie was insane and not fit to stand trial and Reggie should have argued he was coerced into murder by Ronnie.
Yes, but they refused to betray one another.
Exactly.
They remained inside until they died.
But no-one would want to repeat that bit of history.
That's it.
Divide and conquer.
I want you to set up a meeting between me and Johnny Kray.
Just Johnny.
What makes you think Johnny wants to betray Jimmy?
He doesn't want to spend 30 years in prison.
They're twins.
But they're not alike any more, are they?
Just talk to Johnny.
Johnny'll be in touch.
He'll send someone to contact one of us.
Driving a wedge between the twins is a good idea.
Bold.
Buchan's.
Oh, Jesus!
I'll keep my fingers crossed then.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
You're the messenger?
Yeah.
Well, they don't give you a choice.
(MOBILE TRILLS) Miles?
Carpenter's Arms.
Do you know it?
I'll find it.
Where is he, then?
He's on his way.
Yeah, well...
Johnny won't give him a second chance.
He'll be here.
Come on!
Cheers.
He's bottled it.
Any second now.
So this is your revenge, is it?
Swapping sides?
Putting me back in uniform meant I lost a lot of pay.
I had to make up the mortgage somehow.
Humpf.
An open bar and you choose that?
I couldn't see any tea making facilities.
Do you want ice?
Someone's looking after you, then.
Someone in high places.
That's all I know.
Where's Fitz?
I can't hear a heartbeat.
Wait a minute.
He's wearing...
He's wearing body armour!
You bastard!
Come on.
Wake up!
You knew this was an ambush!
You KNEW we could have got killed!
What do you want me to do, eh?
Die with you?
!
I got family.
Yeah.
So have I!
You are under arrest.
You are the only person in the world who is trying to stop them.
The only one who doesn't get it.
So go on.
Arrest me.
Come on!
You're on borrowed time.
DI Chandler.
You're a dead man.
As of now, consider the Krays allies rather than targets.
What they got on you?
Money?
Sex?
What is it?
You've been drinking.
You're not fit to lead any enquiry.
See anything you like?
itfc subtitles
Good morning.
I was just making sure you were still breathing.
You are, in case you were wondering.
I'm sorry your first couple days here have been a little rough.
Not only do I have no idea what I'm doing, but my parents had me when they were 15, so they're pretty much clueless as well.
And that thing that happened yesterday with your great-great Maw Maw...
Mom!
Ow!
No biting!
Let's just say I promise it will never happen again.
Jimmy!
Hey.
You wanna go fake fight on the bridge?
We're gonna throw each other into the river, and watch people freak out as they drive by.
Oh, man, that sounds awesome.
I can't.
Remember that girl I got pregnant, that murdered those people?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
They executed her.
I got stuck with the baby.
Not stuck...
Didn't mean stuck.
I'm cool with it.
I gotta watch what I say.
I don't know if she understands words yet.
Anyway, I can't go jump off a bridge.
I got a baby now.
Here we go, oh, oh, oh
Daddy-o, oh, oh, oh
Let it roll, oh, oh, oh
Like a jelly roll, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Here we go, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh
Oh, sweet, you made breakfast turtles.
It's a good batch, too.
It's gonna give her ham-and-egg-topuses a run for their money.
How'd the second night of sleeping go?
She cried a few times, but she settled down once I got in the crib with her.
You got in the crib with her?
For a little bit, yeah.
Why, is that weird?
- It's a little weird.
- It's a lot weird.
Well, I can't just let her cry.
I'm pretty sure she already hates me.
She never smiles.
Yeah, I noticed that.
I was making funny faces at her last night for, like, an hour.
Nothing.
Maybe she's just a bitch.
- She's not a bitch.
- How do you know?
She's the daughter of a serial killer.
Some of that evilness has to be hermeditary.
Hey, where's Mike's tent?
Here.
"Guys, met a chick, joined a cult.
Later." Again?
I think he's serious this time.
He shaved his head.
Ew!
Not just his head.
With your cousin Mike gone,
I'm gonna need you to work twice as hard today.
You might wanna eat an extra turtle.
Oh, crap, work.
I didn't even think about work.
What am I supposed to do with the baby?
Well, you'll figure it out, man.
Your mother and I both worked when we had you.
See you tonight, Jimmy.
I used to sit in front of this thing for hours.
I'd pretend the deer's parents left him in the woods to stare at me while they went to work.
I'm sure that's what the deer's parents would have done if they'd had to.
Guess I'll just have to take Hope to work with me.
People do that, right?
Bring their babies to work?
Yeah.
I feel like I've seen that.
Morning, Wilfred.
Gonna see if the milkman has come yet.
I'm not your dead husband, Maw Maw.
Woah, hey, I thought I talked to you about this.
You can't smoke around the baby.
Jimmy, smoke rises.
She's not gonna be tall enough to breathe it for a long time.
Why don't you just quit?
What?
When we were young, I thought it made you look like dirty Sandy at the end of Grease, but the older I get, the less I'm enjoying the taste of your mouth.
Gross.
You gonna get her to quit smoking, too?
'Cause as long as she's exhaling, there's gonna be smoke in this house anyway.
So if I get her to quit, you'll quit?
Sure.
Maw Maw, how would you feel about quitting smoking?
Ah!
Good luck with that.
Grab your baby.
Let's get to work.
No, I totally understand.
Now that you point it out, I do see how she could lose a limb or be killed.
I'll get day care for her, I promise.
You know, you could have just said something to us.
Tattletale!
Hello.
Sabrina, right?
Yeah.
Oh, hey.
Guy with the baby.
It's Jimmy.
My name is Jimmy.
Am I crazy, or did this place get a little cowboy-ish since last week?
New owner.
Apparently, he thinks the customers will buy more food if the employees look like a bunch of jackasses.
Hey, check it out.
That crazy lady comes in here with a roll of "day-old" stickers and she puts them on the new bread so she doesn't have to pay full price.
Well, it was nice seeing you again.
Jimmy, hold up.
Hey, do you guys do discounts on day-old anything else, or is it just bread?
Sorry, it's just bread.
So, is this your wife?
- Mom.
- Mom?
I had him when I was young.
I don't recommend it.
- Thanks.
- Sabrina, could you giddy up over here with that step stool?
I can't reach the top shelf on Mustard's Last Stand.
So, is that her?
She's cute.
Nice dumper.
You gonna ask her out?
Not with you here.
You should ask her if she babysits.
Kill two birds with one stone.
Let's just go.
Did Jimmy tell you he's looking for a babysitter?
You don't babysit, do you?
No.
My cousin does, though.
She runs a day care center out of her parents' house.
It's on the same street where the dancing homeless guy hangs out.
His name's Dan, Dancin' Dan.
And he's not our cousin.
Not our cousin.
Jimmy, time to get up.
Get that baby to day care.
That's weird, man.
Weird.
Okay, Daddy's gonna leave you at day care so he can go to work.
But before I go, one little smile to get me through the day.
Come on.
Come on.
You're not gonna smile, are you?
I know in prison that was a sign of weakness, but you're out in the real world now.
It's okay to let your guard down.
And that's why we don't eat glue
Oh, my God, Jimmy?
- Excuse me?
- It's me.
Shelley.
I don't believe this.
I don't believe it either.
So you're gonna call me tomorrow, right?
This is so weird.
I, like, lost your number, and I didn't know how to...
Wow, that was, like, two years ago.
I don't even...
You're probably married.
- Nope.
- Boyfriend?
- Nope.
- Wow.
Wow, oh, this is crazy.
Well, I see you've been busy.
Baby, but no ring on our finger?
Somebody's still a naughty boy.
Yes, still naughty.
Was naughty.
Trying to be less naughty now.
I'm a dad setting a good example.
Anyway, I was looking for day care, but I don't have a ton of cash, so maybe this wasn't even the best...
Oh, no, are you kidding?
For you, I think we could work something out.
You still like this?
No!
Ow!
I don't think that was me.
I hope she did okay on her first day.
As soon as I get up there, start honking the horn.
I don't wanna get stuck talking to Shelley.
Hey, looking good, Dan.
Sorry you lost the election.
I bet you would have made a fine comptroller.
Oh, hey.
Come on in.
I can't.
My dad's really in a hurry.
Wow.
He is in a hurry.
Well, sit down.
I was just getting ready to sing a song to the troops.
Great.
After our little incident today,
I think it's time we remind ourselves about boundaries.
So everybody pay attention.
Rusty.
Sometimes things can make you sad
Sometimes things can make you mad
You might be feeling mangy
Or your diapers might need changing
Or your diaper might need changing I don't know
But whatever it is that's got you grumpy
A thorn in your paw or a great big dumpy
You need to stay calm and follow my golden rule
Don't bite Don't bite
I know it's your way of protection But bites can lead to infection
In some cases, it's a form of affection
But don't bite
What the hell is that?
I can't get her to quit.
She burns me every time I bring it up, so I built her a bubble.
It's loosely based on the plans that cousin Mike had when he was trying to invent the walk-in bong.
And technically, as long as she stays in here, there's no smoke in the house.
So you have to quit.
No, I don't.
If she gets a bubble, I want a bubble.
Hello.
Look who was nice enough to give me a ride home.
Hi, I'm Shelley.
Jimmy and I hooked up a while back.
Just some kissing and heavy petting.
Nice to meet you.
Well, thanks for the ride.
I should probably get Hope to bed.
I'll do it.
I got her to take a nap today, no problem.
Then maybe we can go rent a movie.
Who wants to go to Sleepytown?
You wanna go to Sleepytown, don't you?
Okay, my fuzzy bunny, okay.
Did you see that?
She smiled.
Hope smiled at her.
Maybe your baby's not a bitch.
Well, you're stuck with your dead-tooth little girlfriend now.
Not only is it free day care, she's the only person your kid likes.
What's going on in there?
That is a bit of a design flaw.
Hold your breath, Maw Maw.
Help's on the way.
Oh, we can't go to this register.
It's 15 items or less.
We've got a movie rental and a box of brownie mix.
I'm not done shopping.
Let's go.
Don't worry.
It's my cousin.
She won't care.
- Hey.
- What up, dirtball?
- Baby guy.
- Jimmy.
Jimmy.
Look at you two, hanging out.
Yeah, well, she's watching Hope now, so...
Two years ago, at a party, we got about three quarters of the way between second and third base, and now we're practically raising a baby together.
Get a room, us!
Not me.
Still not me.
This is wild.
Yep, it's pretty wild, but we're probably gonna take it kind of slow.
Condoms!
I forgot condoms.
Sorry.
I had no idea that you hooked up with my cousin.
It seems like I've put you in a bad situation.
No, it's fine.
Really?
'Cause you kind of have this kidnap-victim look in your eyes, like maybe you should be holding up a copy of today's newspaper.
No, it's cool.
I mean, I don't know.
It's not...
It's okay.
She's cool.
She's not charging me for day care, so that's good.
Twelve-pack!
Purple, slim fit.
Help me.
Oh, man, Deuce Bigelow:
European Gigolo.
I've been dying to see this movie.
You know, I'm off soon.
Would you guys care for some company?
Yeah!
That would be great!
The more the merrier!
I mean, if that's okay with you.
That's all right.
She won't see anything.
We'll be under a blanket.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
You should have been here, Jimmy.
We almost made a trash truck swerve into some white chick on a moped.
Cool.
You guys wanna come over?
We're hanging out at my house.
Sure.
These are my best friends.
Is that a deal-breaker with us?
No way.
Right now?
She's coming over now?
Soon.
I've got Javier and Marcus coming over, too.
I figured you guys can all keep Shelley busy while I spend some time with Sabrina.
And I need you to hide all the blankets.
All right.
You need to put a nicer shirt on.
Go.
See if you have something with a V-neck.
I'm seeing a lot of V-necks lately.
So, what's the deal with the rotten chomper, sweetheart?
Funny you should ask.
I keep it as a conversation starter.
What are you doing?
Waiting for your mother.
Gross.
We're gonna have sex.
I realize that.
That's why I said "Gross." Can you shut the door?
No.
I shut the door, she forgets I'm back here, waiting.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Sorry about being late.
There was an accident out on the bridge.
- We brought beer.
- Great.
You need me to...
We?
Oh.
- What's up?
- What's up?
Jimmy, this is my boyfriend, Wyatt.
Wyatt, this is Jimmy.
Cool V-neck.
Where'd you get it?
My room.
Hello.
Mom, you've met Sabrina.
This is her boyfriend, Wyatt.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Nice to meet you.
Boyfriend and girlfriend, huh?
How long's that been going on, a couple weeks?
No, a couple years now.
Wow, that's great!
So, Wyatt, what do you do?
You work at the grocery store, you're a bag boy?
No, ma'am.
I go to college in New York.
I'm studying finance.
Come on in.
Hey, that dude cleans my parents' pool.
'Sup?
Couldn't find any blankets.
The best I could do was a beach towel.
I don't wanna do this.
Is it the tooth?
'Cause I've got Wite-Out in my purse.
No, it's not the tooth.
It's just, I like your cousin, which is stupid because I know that she has a boyfriend, but I can't help it.
That's fine.
Well, are you mad?
Jimmy, we hooked up at a party two years ago, you live with your parents, you have a baby and you clean pools for a living.
I think I'll get over it.
Does that mean you'll keep watching Hope?
'Cause she really likes you.
In fact, you're the only person she likes.
Of course I will, for 60 bucks a week.
Excuse me.
Hey, what's going on out here?
I've had to rewind our lovemaking cassette six times already.
- We gonna do this or what?
- Sorry.
They asked me to play, and my team keeps winning.
What are all you guys doing in my backyard?
- And where is my Buick Skylark?
- Uh-oh.
Somebody found her marbles.
Good, I've been waiting for this.
Maw Maw, I'm your grandson-in-law, Burt.
You've lost your mind and you're never lucid for very long, so listen up.
I understand.
Go.
Let's do this.
We'd like you to quit smoking.
What are you talking about?
You guys aren't letting me smoke, are you?
I quit smoking in 1971.
You did?
Yeah, I quit when Virginia was born.
You quit smoking for me?
If you're Virginia, yeah.
I wanted to live long enough to see what you'd grow up to be.
- Doesn't look like it was worth the wait.
- Thanks.
I guess you can die now.
You wish.
That's why you're letting me smoke, you're trying to kill me.
No one is trying to kill you.
And we won't let you smoke anymore.
In fact, since you're quitting, no one in this house is gonna smoke anymore.
Good luck with that.
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Hey.
Hey.
Brought you some brownies.
Her tooth may be dead, but her baking skills are alive and well.
Thanks.
You okay?
Yeah.
I mean, I'm bummed Sabrina has a boyfriend, but I'm actually more worried Shelley knows I'm not into her.
I gotta figure out how to pay for day care again.
That's the funny thing about having a kid.
They come with their own set of problems.
Make everything else you were worried about seem kind of silly.
- Here.
- What's this?
My cigarette money.
I want you to use it to pay for Hope's day care.
You're gonna quit smoking?
Yep.
I want to stick around to see what you turn her into.
I've had five beers, and that girl with the crappy Chiclet's starting to look pretty good.
So, you might wanna make your way into the bedroom, pronto.
I gotta go take care of this.
Gross.
Somebody's gotta go to sleep soon, don't they?
Yes, you do!
Mom, she did it!
She smiled at me.
She likes me.
She finally likes me.
Well, at least you got one girl to fall in love with you tonight.
Don't you like me?
Don't you like me so much?
English
- US
- SDH
Good morning.
I was just making sure you were still breathing.
You are...
In case you were wondering.
I'm sorry your first couple days... here have been a little rough.
Not only do I have no idea what I'm doing, but my parents had me... when they were 15, so they're pretty much clueless as well.
And that thing that happened yesterday... with your great-great maw maw...
Mom!
Ow!
No biting!
Let's just say, I promise it will never happen again.
Jimmy!
Hey.
You want to go fake fight on the bridge?
We're going to throw each other into the river... and watch people freak out as they drive by.
Oh, man, that sounds awesome.
Oh, I can't.
You remember that girl I got pregnant... that murdered those people?
Yeah.
Yeah.
They executed her.
I got stuck with the baby.
Not stk... didn't mean stuck.
I'm cool with it.
I got to watch what I say.
I don't know if she understands words yet.
Anyway, I can't go jump off a bridge.
I got a baby now.
Oh, sweet, you made breakfast turtles.
That's a good batch, oo.
It's going to give her ham-and-egg tapases... a run for their money.
How'd the second night of sleeping go?
She cried a few times, but she settled down... once I got in the crib with her.
You got in the crib with her?
For a little bit, yeah.
Why, is that weird?
It's a little weird.
It's a lot weird.
Well, I can't just let her cry.
I'm pretty sure she already hates me.
She never smiles.
Yeah, I notice that.
I was making funny faces at her last night for, like, an hour.

Ahh.
Ahh.
Maybe she's just a bitch.
She's not a bitch.
Ahh.
How do you know?
She's the daughter of a serial killer.
Some of that evilness has to be hermeditary.
Hey, where's Mike's tent?

I'm going to need you to work twice as hard today.
You might want to eat an extra turtle.

Well, you'll figure it out, man.
Your mother and I both worked when we had you.
See you tonight, Jimmy.
?
?
...
I used to sit in front of this thing for hours.
I'd pretend the deer's parents left him in the woods... to stare at me while they went to work.
I'm sure that's what the deer's parents would have done if they'd had to.
Guess I'll just have... to take hope to work with me.
People do that, right?
Bring their babies to work?
Yeah.
I feel like I've seen that.
Morning, wilford.
Gonna see if the milkman has come yet.
I'm not your dead husband, maw maw.
Whoa, hey.
I thought I talked to you abo this.
You can't smoke around the baby.
Jimmy, smoke rises.
She's not going to be tall enough to breath it... for a long time.
Why don't you just quit?
What?

Gross.
You going to get her to quit smoking, too?
'Cause as long as she's exhaling, there's going to be smoke in this house anyway.
So if I get her to quit, you'll quit?
Sure.
Maw maw, how would you feel... about quitting smoking?
Good luck with that.
Grab your baby.
Let's get to work.
?
?
...
No, I totally understand.
Now that you point it out, I do see how she could lose a limb or be killed.
I'll get day care for her, I promise.
You know, you could have just said something to us.
Tattletale!
Hello.
Uh, Sabrina, right?
Yeah.
Oh, hey.
Guy with the baby.
It's Jimmy.
My name is Jimmy.
Am I crazy, or did this place... get a little cowboy-ish since last we...
New owner.
Apparently, he thinks the customers will buy more food... if the employees look like a bunch of jackasses.
Oh.
Hey, check it out.
That crazy lady comes in here... with a roll of "day-old" stickers... and she puts them on the new bread... so she doesn't have to pay full price.
Well, it was nice seeing you again.
Jimmy, hold up.
Hey, do you guys do discounts on day-old anything else... or is it just bread?
Sorry, it's just bread.
So is this your wife?
Mom.
Mom?
I had him when I was young.
I don't recommend it.
Thanks.
Man:
Sabrina, could yo giddyup over here... with that step stool?
I can't reach the top shelf on mustard's last stand.
So is that her?
She's cute.
Nice dumper.
You gonna ask her out?
Not with you here.
You should ask her if she babysits.
Kill two birds with one stone.
Let's just go.
Did Jimmy tell you he's looking for a babysitter?
You don't babysit, do you?
No.
My cousin does, though.
She runs a day care center out of her parents' house.
It's othe same street... where the dancing homeless guy hangs out.
His name's Dan... dancing Dan.
And he's, he's not our cousin.
Not our cousin.
Jimmy, time to get up.
Get that baby to day care.
That's weird, man.
Weird.
Okay, daddy's gonna leave you at day care... so he can go to work.
But before I go, one little smile to get me through the day.
Come on.
Come on.
You're not going to smile, are you?
I know in prison that was a sign of weakness, but you're out in the real world now.
It's okay to let your guard down.
?
And that's why we-ee-ee don't eat glue. ?
... oh, my God, Jimmy?
Excuse me?
It's me...
Shelly.
I don't believe this.
I don't believe it either.
So you're going to call me tomorrow, right?
Shh.
This is so weird.
I, like, lost your number, and I didn't know how to...
Wow, that was, like, two years ago.
I don't even...
You're probably married.
Nope.
Boyfriend?
Nope.
Wow.
Wow, oh, this is crazy.
Well, I see you've been busy.
Baby, but no ring on our finger?
Somebody's still a naughty boy.
Um, yes, still naughty.
Was naughty.
Trying to be less naughty now.
I'm a dad setting a good example.
Anyway, I was looking for day care, but I don't have a ton of cash, so maybe this wasn't even the best one...
Oh, no, are you kidding?
For you, I think we could work something out.
You still like this?
No!
Ow!
I don't think that was me.
I hope she did okay on her first day.
As soon as I get up there, start honking the horn.
I don't want to get stuck talking to Shelly.
Hey, looking good, Dan.
Sorry you lost the election.
I bet you would have made a fine comptroller.
Oh, hey.
Come on in.
Oh, I can't.
My dad's really in a hurry.
Whoo!
Oh, wow.
He is in a hurry.
Well, sit down.
I was just getting ready to sing a song to the troops.
Oh.
Great.
After our little incident today,
I think it's time we remind ourselves about boundaries.
So everybody pay attention.
Rusty.

Sometimes things can make you sad ?

sometimes things can make you mad ?

you might be feeling mangy ?

or your diapers might need changing ?
... or your diaper might need changing ?

I don't know ?

but whatever it is that's got you grumpy ?

a Thorn in your paw or a great big dumpy ?

you need to stay calm and follow my golden rule ?
... ?
don't bite ?
... ?
don't bite ?

I know it's your way of protection ?
... ?
but bites can lead to infection ?
... ?
in come cases, it's a form of affection... ?
...
?
But don't bite. ?
... what the hell is that?
Can't get her to quit.
She burns me every time I bring it up, so I built her a bubble.
It's loosely based on the plans that cousin Mike had... when he was trying to invent the walk-in bong.
And technically, as long as she stays in here, there's no smoke in the house.
So you have to quit.
No, I don't.
She gets a bubble, I want a bubble.
Hello.
Look who was nice enough to give me a ride home.
Hi, I'm shelley.
Jimmy and I hooked up a while back.
Just some kissing and heavy petting.
Nice to meet you.
Well, thanks for the ride.
I should probably get hope to bed.
I'll do it.
I got her to take a nap today, no problem.
Then maybe then we can go rent a movie.
Who wants to go to sleepytown?
You want to go to sleepytown, don't you?
Okay, my fuzzy bunny, okay.
Did you see that?
She smiled.
Hope smiled at her.
Maybe your baby's not a bitch.
Well, you're stuck... with your dead-tooth little girlfriend now.
Not only is it free day care, she's the only person your kid likes.
What's going on in there?
That is a bit of a design flaw.
Hold your breath, maw maw.
Help's on the way.
Oh, uh, we can't go to this register.
It's 15 items or less.
We've got movie rental and a box of brownie mix.
I'm not done shopping.
Let's go.
Don't worry.
It's my cousin.
She won't care.
Hey.
What up there, Paul?
Baby guy.
Jimmy.
Jimmy.
Look at you two hanging out.
Yeah, well, she's watching hope now, so...
Two years ago at a party, we got about three-quarters of the way... between second and third base, and now we're practically raising a baby together.
Get a room, us!
Not me.
So not me.
This is wild.
Yep, it's pretty wild, but we're probably gonna take it kind of slow.
Oh, condoms!
I forgot condoms.
Sorry.
I had no idea that... you hooked up with my cousin.
Seems like I've put you in a bad situation.
No, it's fine.
Really?
'Cause you kind of have this kidnapped-victim look... in your eyes, like maybe... you should be holding a copy of today's newspaper.
No, it's cool.
I mean, I don't know.
It's, um, not...
It's okay.
She's cool.
She's not charging me for day care, so, so that's good.
12-pack!
Purple, slim fit.
Oh, man, deuce bigelow:
European gigolo.
I've been dying to see this movie.
You know, I'm off soon.
Would you guys care for some company?
Yeah!
Oh, that would be great!
The more the merrier!
I mean, if that's okay with you.
That's all right.
She won't say anything.
We'll be under a blanket.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
dia de muerto.
Oh, you should have been here, Jimmy.
We almost made a trash truck swerve... into some white chick on a moped... oh, cool.
You guys want to come over?
We're hanging out at my house.
Sure.
These are my best friends.
Is that a deal breaker with us?
No way.
right now?
She's coming over now?
Soon.
I've got javier and Marcus coming over, too.
I figured you guys can all keep shelley busy... while I spend some time with Sabrina.
Oh, and I need you to hide all the blankets.
All right.
You need to put a nicer shirt on.
Go.
Oh, see if you have something with a v-neck.
I'm seeing a lot of v-necks lately.
So, what's the deal with the rotten chomper, sweetheart?
Funny you should ask.
I keep it as a conversation starter.
What are you doing?
Waiting for your mother.
Gross.
We're gonna have sex.
I realize that.
That's why I said "gross."
Can you shut the door?
No.
I shut the door, she forgets I'm back here...
Waiting.
See you later.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry about being late.
There was an accident out on the bridge.
Oh.
We brought beer.
Great.
Uh, you need me to...
We?
Oh.
What's up?
What's up?
Uh, Jimmy, this is my boyfriend Wyatt.
Wyatt, this is Jimmy.
Cool v-neck.
Where'd you get it?
My room.
Hello.
Mom, uh, you met Sabrina.
This is her boyfriend, Wyatt.
Hey.
Hey.
Nice to meet you.
Boyfriend and girlfriend, huh?
How long's that been going on, a couple weeks?
No, a couple years now.
Wow, that's great!
So, Wyatt, what do you do?
You work at the grocery store, you're a bag boy?
No, ma'am.
I go to college in new York.
I'm studying finance.
Come on in.
Hey, that dude cleans my parent's pool.
'Sup?
?
?
...
Couldn't find any blankets.
Best I could do was a beach towel.
I don't want to do this.
Is it the tooth?
'Cause I've got wite-out in my purse.
No, it's not the tooth.
It's just, I like your cousin, which is stupid... because I know that she has a boyfriend, but I can't help it.
That's fine.
Well, are-are you mad?
Jimmy, we hooked up at a party two years ago, you live with your parents, you have a baby and you clean pools for a living.
I think I'll get over it.
Does that mean you'll keep watching hope?
'Cause she really likes you.
In fact, you're the only person she likes.
'Course, I will... for 60 bucks a week.
Excuse me.
Hey, what's going on out here?
I've had to rewind our lovemaking cassette... six times already.
We gonna do this or what?
Sorry.
They asked me to play, and my team keeps winning.
What are all you guys doing... in my backyard?
And where is my buick skylark?
Uh-oh, somebody found her marbles.
Good, I've been waiting for this.
Maw maw, I'm your grandson-in-law Burt.
You've lost your mind and you're never lucid... for very long, so listen up.
I understand.
Go.
Let's do this.
We'd like you quit smoking.
What are you talking about?
You guys aren't letting me smoke, are you?
I quit smoking in 1971.
You did?
Yeah, I quit when Virginia was born.
You quit smoking for me?
If you're Virginia, yeah.
I wanted to live long enough to see... what you'd grow up to be.
Doesn't look like it was worth the wait.
Thanks.
I guess you can die now.
You wish.
That's why... you're letting me smoke;
You're trying to kill me.
No one is trying to kill you.
And we won't let you smoke anymore.
In fact, since you're quitting, no one in this house is gonna smoke anymore.
I...
Good luck with that.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, Whoo!
Hey.
Hey.
Brought you some brownies.
Her tooth may be dead, but her baking skills are alive and well.
Well, thanks.
Mmm.
You okay?
Uh, yeah.
I mean,
I'm bummed Sabrina has a boyfriend, but I'm actually more worried shelley knows I'm not into her.
I got to figure out how to pay for day care again.
That's the funny thing about having kid.
They come with their own set of problems.
Make everything else... you were worried about seem kind of silly.
Shh...
Here.
What's this?
My cigarette money.
I want you to use it to pay for hope's daycare.
You're gonna quit smoking?
Yep.
I want to stick around to see what you turn her into.
I've had five beers, and that girl with the crappy chiclet... is starting to look pretty good.
So, uh, you might want to make your way... into the bedroom pronto.
I got to go take care of this.
Oh, gross.
Somebody's got to go to sleep soon soon, don't they?
Yes, you do!
Mom, she did it!
She smiled at me.
She likes me.
She finally likes me.
Well, at least you got one girl... to fall in love with your tonight.
Don't you like me?
Don't you like me so much?
Stay away!
What's going on here, hell!
Drop the gun!
Now!
Drop the gun!
Vanguard here first
If you watch this video Test 48 did not go according to plan.

Protests continue Regarding the policy of closed Altracorpa door In connection with their unique Program of safe energy.

Altracorpov PR insists are out of their rooms Just stolen documents Who are key for any Research...
Federal investigation is Altracorp cleared of all charges.
Not found any reliable evidence on prohibited actions.
Altracorp was unusually silent In connection with the alleged testing outside the U.S..
It seems that the new slogan with no comments Altracorp Corporation.

When you should be.
What is it?
Why do you expect tribal drums now?
- Do not touch!
- It looks fresh.
- 2, maybe 3 days old.
- Is it oil?
Better question is...
Who is this done?
These are the scarecrows.
And already something of intimidation.
This is a warning.
- What would the "no animals"?
- The birds are coming through the wind.
Looks like organic decay, but I have never seen anything like this.
When you put things can do a few tests.
- It's not a bird, Ray.
- Alena, stay here.
Help Dr Miller on everything.
- So you go back?
- Yes, before it gets dark.
Your boss has my number.
Well, I guess I'll see you when I see you.

No it, Ray.
Stay here!
Wait!
Do not leave me here itself!
Stop!
Kane!
That's our man.
MIEE...
- It's me, Raymond.
- You!
I know you!
What's wrong with him?
MIEE... just calm down.
We have come to the rescue...
- We must go!
There it is!
- Do not move.
Here is...
Everywhere!
We have to leave the island.
MIEE, what is it there?
What happened here?
I killed a lot of birds.
But there were not enough.
It's okay.
With us.
- We need to go to this island.
- It's OK MIEE, we'll go.
But first we must find out what happened.
It is a doctor, can you help.
You're not listening.
Leads me to this island, now!
Vile!
- Blank said.
- I have not finished.
That's it.
Let's go back to the boat.
We must take him to hospital.
All we want you to know as soon as I calm down.
But now, all you have to take from this island.
You are all my responsibility.
We have not yet found his partner Walsh.
Dead.
He's dead.
All dead.
Well... go!
Sophie...
You're not a captain on the island.
This is my mission.
We remain where we are.
You want maybe to vote?
Maybe she's right, Ray.
I can take care of MIEE and here.
Trying to understand...
Well...
Sophie...
Alene Take MIEE back to camp.
Rachel and I'll continue searching.
Villas, I'd like to stay.
This is your team, obviously that is not mine.
I'll be on board until you need them.
You'll all die!
- There could preæi trees.
- Line ravens...
You must be joking!
Where is your ship èovece?
Damn, what we do now?
We must find him!
Maybe... maybe in the bay.
We could swim to it.
We will not swim anywhere.
We would not have withstood the twenty minutes in the icy waters.
Well sir!
What is the hell was that thing?
What they did on this island, and what we actually do here?
Well.
Be honest, we stuck here?
Can we use your satellite phone to send a call for help?
Yes, now razmišijaš reasonable.
- Let it switched on.
- If anyone catches a signal.
The no-fly zone are!
No one listens to the conversation has over the radio here.
In Mièevom camp There transmit.
Is directly linked to Altracorpom.
I'm not right back there.
Falls.
- Here we are safe.
- We can go in the morning.
- Završiæemo search...
- Your search is over!
You saw what it did your man.
I am sure that neither his partner did not have much more luck.
There are a lot of important information that we have to pick up.
Especially now.
So what do you want to do?
To sit and we wait The boat fishing?
We have a schedule of 48 hrs.
No one would not suspect anything, at least 36 hrs.
See... if we can turn on the transmit Spasilaèki team will come here for about 20 minutes.
When we look at the situation, it seems to me that we do not have much choice.
Still nothing.
Do not.
Says nothing.
Just sitting there.
It may not be manifested kroy inorganic matter.
Sand.
Sand is a dead zone.
Can not preæi beach.
Or water.
Therefore, it is like to Mièel leave the island.
Captured here.
Just like me.
Pretty good, right?
It seems quite complicated for doctor.
Well...
I knew exactly what to pack so I packed everything.
Yes, women usually make it.
So...
Clarify me.
Do you know what are they doing here?
Not quite.
Some kind of biological research.
48th Test
Ray is worried that the team neèime infected, so...
Rachel understand...
It is like a razor.
But you, why did you bring?
Jingo!
Just have nice properties.
Yes, that's what I, at least you get what you see.
Maybe you do not like, but at least is honest.
But all of this...
And Ray...
I'm not sure.
Add to paranoid traits.
- At least a traitor is not entered in the list.
I?
You're wanted to leave us all here!
- "Call me when you need it";
- I was there when I needed you, did I?
Forget it, ma'am...
Doctor.
I have not signed up for this shit.
I also dream about the future disappears this family.
Listen Villas, you have to pull together.
This is a profession we have chosen.
You were his superiors.
It was your responsibility.
This is not the first time that I lost a man.
And they will not be the last.
It seems that things gledas's different since you got these lines on the shoulder.
- Published by're Briggs.
- Who brought everyone else!
You were not allowed to bring us into this situation!
We did not have any information, no support...
Watch what you are saying, soldier!
It seems to me that you're happy because you progressed on the list.
Well congratulations...
Sergeant.
No matter is that one of your people returns home in the ark.
It could be worse.
I could be your mother's front door.
You can thank me on it.
Do not enter.
Find his own transportation.
Reje!
What happened?
- It was all around him.
- Get away.
Ray, what was it?
I'm really sorry.
We are not even supposed to come here.
There was no possibility to know what's in the woods.
This is not true.
Raymond!
What is it, reje?
What is going on here?
All this is a setup.
Rachel and I work for Altracorp.
At least not anymore.
So what do we do it here reje?
I worked in biological research in Altracorpu, renewable energies.
I am a scientist.
Funding we abolished when they find deeper pockets.
They took my work And use it for things that I did not want uèestvovati.
Biochemical weapons is much better of the virus.
And is it there?
Some kind of biochemical weapons?
I do not know what it is!
I'm not sure even that Altracorp know.
Something went wrong with their tests there.
Mièel gave me some information recent months.
48th Test
I knew something was wrong.
I had no idea...
- And we're dragged into it!
- I had to get back at MIEE.
You saw why!
See, whatever it is there...
That thing Nesreæni the case.
Consequence of the enterprise in bad faith.
And now you know.
I'm sorry.
And what can we do?
Beach is not safe and do not have no way to defend ourselves.
We need information Mièeve how would we know we are against What for First we need weapons.
If the organic In any way Then he will not appreciate this.
Not at all.
Come on!
Accelerate it!
- Do you work?
- I do not know.
No antenna.
We do not need.
Povezaæemo it with Vilovo satellite phone.
We have it.
Rachel, you and Will you return to the beach.
Run it engine.
Prepare it.
- I want to stay with the radio.
- I need you for the PC.
Stay here.
I found it!
- Do what you need.
- I do.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Continue to walk.
Let's see if that works.
Goal!
- Find test 48th
- I know, I know...
If you watch this video Test 48, did not go according to plan.
Here, Vanguard 1, Do not come here.
I repeat:
Do not come!
Mièel.
I suppose you this message never arrived.
Can we go now?
I have to stop.
We must not stop.
We have to move!
Come on!
I'll overtake you.
L'll these ice from the refrigerator.
'll Be right back.
Rachel!
What's happening?
Well, if you do that?
It would be good to have the original...
Forget the torch, let's go!
Where are they?
Where the hell!
Rachel!
Where is she?
Where is it?
Where the hell?
Something happened to her...
- What happened?
- Is infected!
Let me go!
Hey man, There was nothing I could do.
Reje is infected.
Some sort of weapon.
Dispersed.
In order...
Now we can defend ourselves.
Poèeæu Mièelovim to work on files.
I'll see what I can piece down.
There it is.
Part of the miracle...
Somewhere.
Iskoristiæe her to come here.
We must be vigilant.
Do you think it's gonna be okay?
I was guilty of this.
Have you all taken?
Should be sufficient to think to work for Altracop.
Were there any problems with the provision?
Nothing that I could not fix it.
What files?
Did you take them?
Mièel had done his part.
You have a lot of reading ahead.
Go take a shower.
This is...
This is an SOS.
Please check and reply.
Reception.
Wait.
This is a call for help.
Called at intervals.
Just keep an open channel to hear if someone replies.
Be there and listen.
This is an SOS.
Please reply.
Please.
Have you solved the mystery?
Seems to have worked on Altracorp new kind of biological weapons.
On a live weapon.
And this one that destroys all other living creature.
So the goal and the infection spreads Cells like a virus.
The infection is supposed to be reserved isotope which Is similar to that found in raspršivaèu.
Good soldiers can be move freely Bad soldiers, become black and sticky.
- It is obvious that something went wrong.
- Very.
Disease has not only infected Cells, completely took over.
It'll be a living is like hives in which All Cells are working together This disease is the same principle.
But just as it fulfills its purpose ..
... Which is it?
To infect and destroy?
That is expanding continuously;
That's about it to.
- What kind of doctor are you?
I am a toxicologist.
Specialist I for reverse engineering.
It is pretty specific to the field of for a rescue mission.
And you are in this from the beginning, right?
See, I did not know what happened here.
We have not told you about your safety, We know you'll stay with us.
And when I saw how you reacted Rejevu the story last night I just did not want to just think about me.
- And Allen?
- We knew the same as Ray.
To test something Altracorp horrible here.
Something that must be stopped.
These are experiments that are not allowed to continue.
Someone has to take on that responsibility.
See how much it cost.
I tried to protest.
To do something.
But instead I...
released.
They did so in order take my research.
... To do this.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this Villa.
But do not blame her.
I am the job.
And God knows that I paid a high price But I have to finish this.
Now more than ever.
I must not let this thing beat.
You know, Captain Ahab said the same thing.
You know how to take care of yourself, It is pretty and you're good at it, Villas But as you are in a broader perspective?
Did you used to be sacrificed because of little something for what you knew was right?
This is called purpose.
Something you believe.
Something to fight, regardless of price Because you know that this is the right thing to be done.
I believe that we're doing the right thing.
Do you believe that you did the right thing by telling me this information?
Yes, sir.
- But the mission was successful, right?
- Not for my men, sir.
Your people?
You think people sergeant Cutter.
Its mission, his decision.
Whatever the motives that had, In your mišIjenju Will remain just that.
Your mišIjenje.
Success is measured in this world the two things.
Through perseverance and dedication.
Are you devoted razogu, rows?
Do you think that doing the right thing?
There.
We found the reason.
Sergeant Kater has released its people by you sent them...
That's enough!
Faces I have a dilemma soldier.
Your word against your word superior officers.
Yes, Sergeant Kater was already here...
He explained his work And your reckless disregard his orders!
I will not tolerate disloyalty!
Neither the army, nor our purpose.
As of this moment is dismissed, the soldiers.
The decision is effective immediately.
Do not say anything because What for are you going to repent, my son...
I want to be the Next helicopter here!
Do you understand me?
You go... civilian.
What about crows?
With coffee?
Completely collapsed.
Dead.
In order to reverse the process I need a live specimen.
I doubt that this thing will want to cooperate.
Maybe a little something to testiralištu we could use.
We must try something.
Rachel is still there.
It is not Rachel.
Now a part of it.
Infected.
As Mièel.
But not dead.
Exactly!
If infected, and if the live I might have with the help of her blood could create a serum.
It could work.
Mièel said all the chemical elements And I could use the pollen from raspršivaèa one that you have found.
What do you need from me, reje?
Let us go and we find Rachel.
There is somewhere.
Watching us.
I know.
Keep walking.
That's it.
I made a similar device based on their designs.
This is an underground station.
Injects a toxin into the center of the island.
Should we reverse the process if we use the serum.
Then keep scrolling.
There you go.
There is no one around to we share with them.
Do you see anything?
Still nothing
Rachel!
Ray will not come.
I have it!
Holds it firmly!
Sorry about that.
Postaviæemo machine drain.
Right back up before dawn.
Call us through this if you manage to make a serum.
I did it!
Functions.
- You serious?
- I think.
I used her natural antibodies doskoèim to infect Using a similar chemical mixture that of a gun...
Molecular... irrelevant.
It was successful in small doses.
We need a bigger sample.
Throw it on the enemy and hope that will not expand.
Does not sound like a smart idea brilliant minds.
We plan a way of control.
A similar spray from that weapon.
Soldiers would take a pill, a bookmark Which would then developed resistance the infection.
- How is it changed?
- Everything has changed for the worse.
Ready.
Hurry!
I know...
I try!
Rachel?
O God!
What the hell?
What happened?
- This thing...
- How do you feel?
Are you okay?
I do not know.
Why am I tied?
- I do not believe it!
- Works!
It's quick, but you returned to normal.
You need water.
Alene, she does it.
- I need to call Ray.
- It is?
Thank goodness.
- I'm sure you this is surprising.
- What are you doing?
And now we are alone.
I have to admit Doctor, impressed I. I did not think you'll succeed.
And now...
Give me the rest...
We both know that this is not the whole sample.
You think I'm stupid?
Let's... the tent.
To take it all.
Take...
Or do you want me to ask?
I have other plans, but...
This can be useful.
- You're pushed boat.
- I'm guilty of this.
I could not allow anyone to go here before I finish.
I even saved the life of Rey, I really needed it to complete its mission.
Why?
I have to finish their testing.
49th Test
Latest invention, the control group.
- Keep them at bay
- You were not in danger.
No.
I was just a good actor.
Now you just need one more thing to do.
Should I put my sample in Rejevu gadget.
He came to my turn to infect.
Sorry for this doctor.
Nothing personally, All this is just a job.
Is that what you think it is?
Potpredsednièe, I know that your time is valuable Because I'll be brief.
Doctor Raymond Hua I was just contacted in connection with one mission ..
Ray is planning a trip to the island Meyer.
Wants to shake up things a bit.
This is not good for you sir potpredsednièe Vesler?
I want to help, but require protection Altracorpa.
No doubt you want the money.
It would be very nice of you.
May undermine its operation from the inside And can provide you what you want.
What I want to?
49th Test
Allen is a radio set in the dead zone.
He now works.
Someone will soon appear.
In this case, we'll begin.
Thank you.
What for?
No one has saved his life so far.
- And how was it?
- It was very nice!
Here SES 1, we receive a call for help on this channel.
- Here we are!
- Hello!
Here, Dr Sophie Miller.
Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear Dr Miller.
Thank God!
Signal are read your site Alfa 9th
In the forbidden zone are.
Prepare for evacuation.
Arrive in 20 minutes.
Reception.
We have them.
Wait!
We do not have too much time To start the test.
Are you kidding?
Tell that to the guys when they come.
They will not understand.
We need to do now.
But they come in 20 minutes Ray.
Then do not waste time anymore.
Ray, spasiæe us.
His struggle to carry Altracorpa, to the media Tell them what happened here.
You do not have to take the chance your life...
To take the chance?
Look what I've been lost.
Nothing will not to mean if you do not finish what I started!
What we've begun.
I can not afford to reje they have done.
Stop!
It's your fault...
Do not leave Rachel...
- Is The vial!
- There is something much worse.
Going to testiralište.
But the soldiers come in 15 minutes!
Sophie, wait back here.
The team is coming very quickly.
Go to Allen.
Villas I could use your help.
Yes, it is always the case.
Listen...
Let's go.
This way, we're going.
You end launch and stop Allen.
And you?
I'm going to play around with the locals.
Hey, Roršak!
I'm here!
Run!
It is almost Alene!
Not yet...
It's over!
Not until I tell you!
You should know something about the persistence of Ray.
But one should know when to quit.
Back to work.
Provide the beach!
Faster, faster!
Check the tent!
Tent was empty.
Contact in 12 hours.
Go!
I'm sorry Ray. 're Just late.
What did you do?
Something the release here.
Something much stronger than what they thought And now it's mine!
You can not control it.
Come with me.
Come with me!
I feel better.
What's happening?
I do not know.
Come on.
Where the serum?
With Allen.
Run!
My move.
We go from here?
Alfa time, What's your status?
Command, Alpha team leader here.
Saved as we move back.
Air support may take.
Again, air support can go!
Alfa understand, start with Clay.
Air support is coming.
The boat enters the!
All you all right?
Here they are!
We still have not finished here.
Where is Sophie?
I told you.
Good.
Very well.
Talk with her...
Same as with you.
Story?
Does this so called?
Tell me again why I can not let from here?
Why I am here a prisoner?
It is very pesimistièan view.
And you call me that?
A detainee in the fight.
Uèestvovali you are in a very unusual event.
We have to take precautions.
I told you everything.
I am not infected.
Does not work like that!
Look at us as enemies.
I do not blame you for that.
If I were in your place, as I thought!
Someone watching us?
Yes, it is always the case.
In whatever you believe, And do you believe We are not the enemy.
Then why are my hands tied?
And where is Sophie!
I want to see it.
The victims in this life must always submitted, Mr. Kane.
For the greater good.
Do you ask me to join you?
Are you kidding?
I will not do it!
Can you hear me there?
I will not be part of this!
I will not be part of this!
You've been...
So there are no side effects?
None.
Are you sure about this?
There are no side effects.
Mr. Kane has already infected 72 hours and shows no adverse effects.
It is completely healthy.
I did not ask on the subject of testing.
I asked you about the infection.
Test 49 was a complete success.
Congratulations, doctor.
Stay away!
What the hell is going on here?
Put the gun down!
Now!
Put the gun down!
This first patrol.

Can I offer you something, dear?
Yes, just an orange juice.
Thank you.
Two dollars.
Set now.
Put it on my account, Boby.
Oh no. .
Really, it's okay.
Do it.
I'm serious.
It is easier to accept the to discuss with him.
Thank you.
You are not here, is not it?
No, I'm from California.
California...
Los Angeles?
San Francisco.
-Good.
I love the girls Los Angeles, too.
The attitude...
I like several things.
Paid back if you tell me your name.
Dr. Miller.
It came very quickly.
Ray-Hua, Altracorp.
-Sophie Miller.
Glad to finally know it.
I'm Tucker.
I talked to her first.
Thank you for keep him company.
I assume here, friend.
Let's dance a little.
Can we?
- You dance with me?
I'd love to.
You do not create way, Tuck.
I always stop fun time.
They are my new friends deserve respect.
Is that clear?
Sure as whiskey.
-Say good-bye.
Nice to meet you.
Will Cain.
I'm in charge.
Hello, everyone.
On behalf of Altracorp,
Thank you for joining us this mission.
Sophie, this is Allen Tirsten, Our specialist.
Technology officer.
Rachel is in charge of recognition and rescue me.
You are military, right?
Where he served?
She speaks only when necessary.
A perfect girlfriend, right?
- And you, Miss.
Miller, What to do?
- Dr. Miller!
It is our doctor.
We lost touch with the reconnaissance team.
They were here, Mare Island... 35 miles west.
This island became the main Altracorp area tests.
What do they test?
The camp was here, communications were cut.
The flights are prohibited in this area and no radio contact works well when it works.
The island is covered by a thick layer of soot...
There should be little or no animal.
Our mission is an operation Simple search and rescue... scour the island and find the team missing.
If that fails, we will recover any data... to explain what happened.
- Allen, this is your part.
- Failed?
Weird, is not it?
I want to find survivors.
For it is here.
But the mission first.
Mr. Kane will provide transportation to enter and leave the island.
The rest we know.
We start tomorrow morning, then try to sleep well.
Hello, Miss!
Well, we never finish talking.
Not now, I'm going to bed.
Wait a minute, now.
Just wanted to talk...
But when he mentioned the bed...
I was kind of excited.
Want to see?
Do not push me!
Not in terms of use it, Tuck...
Only the knife.
Go home, Tuck!
Before I turn to his wife.
Well. .
I do not know what to say.
Thank you.
Do not thank me.
Just do not want to lose my new job before being paid.
Already arranged to place all these bags?
The Altracorp not traveled lately.
Permission to board, Captain!
Where no inconvenient, Doctor.
Good day to you too.
Sorry.
I slept badly as hell.
I see.
Aspirin.
I have headaches.
Want?
About two miles of the site landing here.
Hey, Ray
- Where the receptionist?
- Not so fast, "StarTrek".
Want to help us with things?
We camp here.
Allen, you and Dr. Miller assemble the station.
Rachel and I go to the first Camp Mitchell.
Stay in touch.
Here...
If they need.
What is that?
Why do not expect the tribal drums now?
Do not touch!
-Looks cool.
- Have two or three days, maybe.
- It is the oil?
The better question is...
Who did this?
They are like scarecrows-crow or something.
It's a warning.
- What happened to life "not wild"?
- The birds come through the wind.
It seems organic decay, but I never saw anything like it.
Once we settled things we can do some tests.
- There is a bird, Ray
- Allen, stay here.
Help with Dr. Miller all she needs.
No problem.
Are you going back?
Yes, before it gets dark.
Your boss has my number.
Well, it seems that I will see when they see it.
It is.
I hope you find your team.
Can you help me with this?
It was Ray
Stay here!
Hey, wait...
Do not leave me here.
Stop, Kane!
It's one of ours.
Mitchell!
- I, Raymond.
- You!
I know you.
I know you!
What's wrong with him?
Mitchell, calm down.
We came to rescue him...
- We have to go...
Do not move!
Is there, for everything!
We have to leave, we have to leave.
Mitch, what's out there?
What happened here?
I killed several birds, but it is not enough.
Okay.
He is with us.
- We have to leave this island.
- Okay, Mitch.
We will leave.
But first we need to know what happened to you.
- She is a doctor, can help you.
Do not hear me...
- Mitch...
- Get me out of this island, now!
Will!
- It was empty.
- I had not loaded.
That's...
Let's go back to the boat.
We have to take him to a hospital.
You can find out what you want so it calms down.
But now, I need to take all of this island.
They are all under my responsibility.
We have not found his partner, Walsh.
Dead.
He's dead.
All are dead.
Very well.
Let's get going!
- Sophie...
You're not the captain on this island.
This is my mission.
We are where we are.
Want to make a vote?
He may be right, Ray
Mitch can take care of here.
- Try to understand...
All right,
Sophie Allen, lead Mitch back to camp.
Rachel and I will continue the search.
Will, I would like to stay.
This team is yours, is clearly not mine.
I'll be on the boat even need me.
We will all die!
He can not pass through the trees.
A line of crows.
Can not be serious!
Where is your boat, man?
What we do now?
We have to find it!
Maybe... is at bay.
We could swim there.
We're not going to swim anywhere.
Would not last twenty minutes this cold water.
Well, Captain...
What the hell was that?
What made this island, and what in fact we doing here?
Will!
Be honest Well, I will not say we're stuck here?
We can use the satellite phone to send a distress signal?
Yes, now you're thinking.
Let's make this work.
This is a catch-signal...
This is a forbidden area for flight!
Nobody will hear a word out of here.
There is a transmitter in Mitch camp.
It has a direct connection with Altracorp.
I'm not going back there.
It is already dark.
- We are safe here.
- We can go in the morning.
- Finish the quest...
- Your search is over!
See what happened to her man.
I am sure that neither your partner has had more luck.
There is important information to be recovered.
Especially now.
So what to do?
Only sit and wait for the Basque fishing?
We have a period of 48 hours.
No one will foul up our the remaining 36 have passed.
If the transmitter is working, we have a team rescue in 20 minutes.
Given the situation, I do not think we have no choice.
Nothing yet.
No, do not say anything.
Just sit.
Perhaps it can manifest in inorganic compounds.
The sand is a dead zone.
He can not pass by the beach.
Or water.
That's why Mitch wanted to leave the island.
You are stuck here.
So do we.
Cool, huh?
It seems difficult for a doctor.
He did not know what to bring, then brought everything.
Yes, that's what women do.
So enlighten me...
You know what's going on here?
Not at all.
A type of biological experiment...
Test 48.
Ray fears that the team has contracted something, then...
Rachel's okay, I understand...
She is like a blade.
But why he brought her here?
It is also chauvinistic!
You're pretty face...
Yes, I am what I am, by what he sees.
Maybe not like, but at least I'm honest.
But all this...
The Ray. .
I'm not sure.
- Add to this paranoia.
At least not a traitor-entered the list.
I?
You would leave us behind!
- "Call me when you need it?"
- He was there when needed, was not it?
Forget it, lady...
"Doctor".
Did not sign up for it.
There goes the future of this family.
You know that when entered, boy.
This is the profession we choose.
You were the officer in charge.
The responsibility was his.
It is not the first time I lost a man, and will not be the last.
Things are changing ever who earns more bars on the shoulder.
Betrayed-Briggs.
-I saved the rest of us!
Never should have in placed in this situation!
We had no information no support...
Be careful what you say, soldier!
I suppose you're happy jumping out.
Congratulations...
Sgt.
Nothing matters when one of his men coming home then?
It could be worse.
I could be at the door his mother now.
You can thank me for it.
Nor between.
Find a way to go.
Ray!
What happened?
- Was upon him.
- Stay away.
Ray, what was that?
I'm sorry.
Should not be here.
He could not know what would happen here.
This is not true.
Raymond!
What is this, Ray?
What is happening here?
All this was set.
Rachel and I do not work to Altracorp.
No more.
So what we are doing Here then, Ray?
I worked doing research Altracorp in biological, division of renewable energy.
I am a scientist.
But when they cut the funding found a deviation from the budget.
My job was taken from me...
Applied in areas where I never I would have been a part.
Biochemical weapons as advanced which would dominate any war.
And that's out there?
Some kind of "biochemical weapons"?
I do not know what it is!
I do not think that neither Altracorp know.
Something went wrong with the they were testing.
Mitchell gave me some information in recent months.
The test 48.
He knew something was wrong.
I had no idea...
And we-wrapped it!
-I had to get Mitchell.
Have you seen that!
Whatever is out there...
This thing...
It is an accident.
Result of thoughtless actions.
Now you know.
I'm sorry.
And what do we do now?
The beach is not safe and not We can defend ourselves.
We need the data to Mitchell know against what we are dealing.
First we need weapons.
If organic if life, or something...
Will not like it.
Not a bit.
Right on!
Walk fast.
- Is it working?
I do not know.
Is not aerial.
We do not.
Works with satellite phone.
All right!
Rachel, you and Will get back to the beach.
Use to connect the generator.
Prepare themselves.
- I want to stay with the radio.
- I need to stay on the computer.
Stay here.
I made it!
- Do whatever is necessary.
- Absolutely.
What is it?
-Nothing.
So go on!
Let's see if it works.
Bingo!
- All right, look for "test 48".
I know, I know...
If you are receiving this transmission, test48failed.
Hereisarecognitionoftheteam:
Do not proceed. lt;/ Igt;
Irepeat:
Do not
Mitchell.
I did not receive this message.
Okay, can we go now?
I need to stop.
We can not stop...
We have to continue.
Come on!
I reach you.
I'll get ice in the refrigerator.
I'll be back.
Rachel!
What's going on?
Think you can?
- It would be nice to know the origin...
- What is this?
Forget the torch, let's go!
Where are they?
Where is everybody?
Rachel...
Where is she?
Where is she?
Where the hell is she?
Something happened to her...
What happened?
-She is infected!
Rachel!
Let go of me!
There is nothing to do.
She was already, Ray
Some kind of weapon...
Expandable.
And the worst...
Now nor can we defend.
Can I work in archives of the Mitchell see what I can achieve.
She's out there.
Spread...
Somewhere.
And not going to get us here.
We have to beware.
You think he'll be okay?
It should be blaming themselves.
Got everything?
It should suffice to carry on the work of Altracorp.
Any problems with security?
Nothing I could not handle.
And the files?
He took the files?
Mitchell did his part.
It seems to have enough material.
I take a shower.
This is...
This is an SOS.
Please check and reply.
Exchange Rates.
Wait.
It is sending the pulses at intervals.
Let the open channel to know if someone will respond.
Continue listening.
This is an SOS.
Emergency.
Please answer.
Please?
Has solved the mystery?
It seems that was Altracorp working on a new type of biological weapon.
A living weapon.
One that destroys any living thing, attacking cells, such as a virus.
The contagion can be contained with isotopes, similar substances vanish.
Good soldiers roam freely, bad soldiers are black and sticky.
- But of course, something went wrong.
- Very.
The contagion not only reached infected cells...
Reached all.
This life is like a "honeycomb cells, "they all work together.
The contagion happens the same way.
With the difference meet your goal.
That would be what?
Infect and destroy?
Expand continuously.
That would be why.
- What kind of doctor are you?
- Toxicologist.
Actually, I'm an expert science of reverse engineering.
It is a very specific field of work for a rescue mission.
Is this from the beginning, is not it?
Look, I did not know what had happened here.
Wow!
Do not tell your own safety, did not know we'd be stuck with us.
And when I saw how you reacted with Ray in the history of the last night...
I did not want to think that wanted out.
Allen, too?
-We knew Ray knew.
That was testing Altracorp something terrible here.
Something has to be stopped.
This is the type of experiment can not continue.
Someone has to take this responsibility.
See what happened.
I tried to speak.
I tried to do something.
Instead of listening to me, I said goodbye.
Things I can continue to my research.
Like this.
I'm sorry to have him put it, Will.
But do not blame her.
I am the culprit.
And God knows I've paid a high price.
But I have to finish it.
Now more than ever.
I can not let this thing beat.
He knew that Captain Ahab said the same thing?
It's very good at taking care of himself, Will...
But when it comes to something bigger?
It has been sacrificed for something I knew it was correct?
It's called cause.
Something to believe.
Something that will fight, whatever the cost...
Because he knows that it is the right thing to do.
I believe I'm doing the right thing.
Believe you did the right thing to bring me this information?
Yes, sir.
I believe.
- But the mission was a success, right?
Pros-not my men, sir.
His men?
I wanted to say, men Sergeant Cutter.
The mission and the decisions were his.
Any reason it can have, in your opinion... remain so.
- How does your opinion.
- But, sir, he tried...
The success in this world is measured by two things:
perseverance and dedication.
- You is dedicated to the cause, soldier?
- Yes, sir, but...
You think you're doing the right thing here?
There it is.
Sergeant Cutter put her men in danger when...
Enough!
I'm experiencing a dilemma here, soldier.
His word against that of their superior officers.
Yes, Sergeant Cutter has come to me see me and explained his actions... and its total disregard for their orders!
I will not tolerate disloyalty!
Neither the army nor the cause.
Being discharged soldier.
It shall enter into effective immediately.
Do not say anything that repent, son...
I want you out of here!
You understand me?
You are exempt, civil.
- And the ravens?
Waste?
- Completely decomposed.
Dead.
To reverse the process I need a live sample.
I doubt this thing will want to cooperate.
There must be something in the test now we can use.
We have to try something.
Rachel is still there.
No more Rachel.
Now she is part of it.
Is infected, as Mitchell.
But not dead.
Exactly!
If she was infected for that, and it is alive... maybe I can create an antiserum with her blood.
It might work.
Mitchell said that all the chemicals are broken.
Can I use the component of the pollen found that expander.
What needs me, Ray?
Let's find Rachel.
She's out there...
Watching us.
I know.
Keep walking.
Here is good.
I built a similar device based on the prospectus.
It is an injection station.
It pumps out toxins the center of the island.
We must reverse the process using the antiserum.
Let's go, right?
Here!
Now there we need to divide.
- Do you see anything?
Not yet.
Rachel!
She will not come, Ray
Got it!
Hold!
Sorry about that.
Let's turn the device on the gun.
Return before daybreak.
Call us to achieve something.
I did it!
It works.
Really?
-I think so.
I used the natural antibodies it to reverse the infection.
A chemical compound, similar to the polyps,
Molecular... that is.
Do not work in small doses.
We need a larger sample.
Play with the enemy and luck will spread.
Sounds like a perfect strategy a privileged mind.
They planned a form of control, spray gun similar to this.
The soldiers drank a tablet, a label...
Would develop resistance to infection.
- What does this change?
- Change for the worse.
It's ready.
Quick!
I know!
I'm trying!
Rachel?
My God!
But what...
What happened?
- This thing...
- How do you feel?
Okay?
I do not know.
Why am I tied?
Do not believe it.
-Works!
Is still abnormal.
Needs water.
Allen, untie it.
- I have to call Ray
- Okay?
Thanks to God.
Allen!
- Now, you should be surprised.
- What are you doing?
Now we are alone.
I must admit, doctor, I was impressed.
I did not think it would succeed.
But what about the rest?
We know it is not a sample complete.
You think I'm stupid?
Come on, at the center of something we take for everything.
Take...
Or will be looking at?
I have other plans, but...
This can be useful.
- You let the boat.
- "Guilty. "
I can not let anyone leave before I finish here.
To save the life of Ray needed him to complete his mission.
- Why?
- I have my own test to finish.
The test 49.
Brand new, for the control group.
- Give 'em.
- You were never at risk.
No.
It was just a good performance.
I just need do something else.
Need to adjust the device Ray with my own sample.
It's my turn to infect.
Sorry about that, Doctor.
Nothing personal, only business.
It is what I think?
Beautiful clothes, I know your time is valuable... then I will be brief.
Dr. Raymond Hua only contact I in relation to the mission...
Ray is planning a short trip to Mare Island.
Want to give a way at all.
This is not good for you, is it?
Mr. Vice beautiful clothes, Vesle?
I want to help, but I want the protection of Altracorp.
And some money, no doubt.
It would be kind of you.
Can sabotage the operation in... and still give you what you need.
And what would that be?
The test 49.
Allen set the radio in a frequency dead.
Now it works.
Someone will soon appear.
So let's end this.
Thank you.
Why?
No one ever saved my life before.
- How was it?
- It was nice.
Here is HS1, answering the request for help on this channel.

They'll be here in 20 minutes, Ray So let's not waste anymore time.
Ray, we will be rescued.

Risk?
Look what I've already lost.
It will not do anything unless finish what I started!
What we got.
I can not let him do it, Ray

- I will play with the natives.
- Will!
Hey, you!
I'm here!
Run!
- Eventually, Allen!
- Not yet...
- Over!
- Not until I tell you!
Should know something about persistence, Ray
But you should know when to quit.
Back to work.
Provide to the beach!
Walk, walk!
- Check the camp.
- The camp is empty!
Contact at 12 hours.
Move!
Sorry, Ray It's too late.
What did you do?
There will be something here.
Something much more powerful than planned.
And now it's mine.
You can not control it.
Come with me.
Come with me!
I feel better.
- What is happening?
I do not know.
Come on!
Where the serum?
With Allen.
Run!
- My turn.
Do not.
Let's get outta here!
-Move!
Alfatango,wherethe situation

Come on, come on!
Get in the boat.
Are you well?
Here they come!
We're not done.
- Where is Sofia?
- I told you.
She's fine.
Very well.
Being interrogated like you.
Questioned?
It is well they call it?
Tell me again Why not let me go?
Why am I a prisoner?
It is a very pessimistic way to face it.
- And as you call it?
- An arrest in combat.
He was part of an event unusual.
We have to take precautions.
I've told you everything.
I'm not infected.
This does not work that way!
Sees us as enemies.
Do not blame you for that.
If you were in your place, would find the same.
Someone is watching us?
Yes, always watching.
Whatever you believe, think or believe... are not the enemy.
So why my hands are tied?
Where is Sofia?
I want to see it!
There are always sacrifices to be made in this life, Mr. Kane.
For the greater good.
You are asking me to unite myself to you?
Are you kidding?
I do not want.
Are you listening?
I will not be part of it!
I will not be part of it!
You already are.
So there side effects?
No.
- Are you absolutely sure of this?
No side-effects.
Mr. Kane is already infected for some 72 hours without adverse effects.
It is perfectly healthy.
I was not asking on the guinea pig test want to know about the infection.
49 The test was a success.
Congratulations, Doctor.
Sorry.
It's going to be okay.
Just don't think about it.
Yeah.
I just hate hospitals.
- Dang it.
- What?
I left my book at the house.
You know, in case we have to wait.
Shoot!
Um...
I'll look in my purse.
You rock.
You left it on the table.
Thank you.
Promise me you're not goanna leave, all right?
You're not goanna take off when they put me under.
I promise.
I would never leave.
Woman:
Isn't that always the way it works?
Man:
You'd think you see somebody with a crutch, they're goanna help 'em out.
Right, naturally.
Don't even hold the door.
All right, you stay there, please.
Give me one moment.
I can at least get out.
Let me just get the crutch.
Wait, wait.
- I can just stand.
- Come on.
The brace.
You're awesome.
- I love you.
Be careful.
- Love you.
Thank you.
- I'll be right up.
- All right.
Woman #2:
What's this I hear about you taking the morning off?
Woman:
Kevin has orthopaedic surgery today.
Aww!
You're such a good girlfriend.
I told you about it.
He's always there for me.
He's amazing.
I think the bank could go one day without me.
You don't mind covering, right?
Of course.
Of course.
So when do I get to meet him?
- I don't know.
- It's been four months.
- I'm back.
I want to meet him.
- I know.
I just have never been in a relationship before where it's actually going well.
- How can I help you?
- Hi, where's outpatient surgery?
- Squeezed you in under the wire, huh?
- What do you mean?
We're shutting down for renovations on Saturday.
Most of our patients have already been moved to County West.
- Oh.
- Go through those doors and take the elevator up.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
Tell him we'll give him an extra basis point.
If he's worried about the rates and us not being competitive, tell him to just look at our rates.
Listen, Craig's been on this case.
Just have him deal with it.
If you have any questions, call Craig.
Okay, bye.
Hi.
Hey, baby.
Any trouble parking?
No, but I did finally speak with Christine, who wants us all to grab a pizza this weekend.
Her words.
All of us.
- The best friend that I never get to meet?
- Yes.
That's a biggie.
"Heart disease?" No.
"Rheumatic fever?" No.
- "Snoring?"
- Sometimes.
- Really?
- Yeah.
So you're sure you're okay with this whole introduction thing to your friends?
That's a big step.
No.
Every time I introduce her to anybody, it's sort of bad luck.
Well, don't you worry.
Because you are not goanna lose me.
Ever.
"Social Security number"?
I've been having the hardest time writing on this.
Oh, here, lean on this.
Ahh.
Thank you.
So you must be Kevin Peterson.
- I am.
- I'm Amanda.
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Mary.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Dr. Harding will be in in a moment so I just want to check some things out.
Okay.
- It's all done.
- Thank you.
Does your wife mind waiting outside?
Oh, well, we're not married.
I don't mind.
Do you have a place I could grab a coffee?
We have a cafeteria attached to the lobby downstairs.
Perfect.
Thank you.
You goanna be okay?
Yeah, I'm goanna be fine.
Don't leave me though, right?
- Promise?
- I promise.
Cross my heart, promise.
Okay.
You take care of him.
Oh, how long will it be?
- About an hour.
- An hour?
Really?
- Yep.
- Well, good luck.
Thank you.
See you in an hour.
Just tell him that he has to sign the request form in person.
Yeah, he has to come in.
He already knows that.
Just do it.
I'll tell him if I have to.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Let him know I'll call him back this afternoon.
I'll call you back, bye.
- Let me please.
- Thank you.
Sorry.
There's a garbage...
- Yeah.
- Right there and another one.
Oh, thanks a lot.
- I'm Cooper, by the way.
- Cooper, I'm Mary.
- Mary.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- You want some company?
- Sure.
Well, okay.
So what are you-
- What am I in for?
- I wasn't going to say it quite like that, but yes.
My wife, she has breast cancer, and well, she's up in chemo.
How's it going?
I'm sorry.
Small improvement.
We're keeping our fingers crossed.
- So we'll see what happens.
- I'm sorry.
What about you?
You're not here for the coffee, right?
I'm just here for the day.
My boyfriend's having orthopaedic surgery.
He tore his A.C.L.
hiking and flared up an old football injury.
He hurt himself, huh?
Yep.
Keep telling him to take it easy.
You don't like hospitals, do you?
Does anybody like hospitals?
Except for the doctors and nurses?
I've been doing this every week for six months.
And I can't wait till they shut this place down.
- Believe you me.
- Sorry.
Wow, look at you go.
It's my job.
MIT said that 90% of people who use smart phones feel more stress.
Only 90%?
I mean, look at you.
You're sitting in a hospital waiting for your boyfriend, and you're working.
What happened to the days where you could say,
"I'm out of the office," you know?
Well, sir, to the good old days.
- Cheers, Mary.
- Cheers.
Kevin.
Man over P.A.:
Monica Hernandez, your party is ready in post-op.
Jeanette Stevens, Mary Turner, your parties are ready.
- May I help you?
- Yes, please.
Hi.
My boyfriend was having surgery, and I just want to see how much longer it's going to be.
Certainly.
What was his name?
Peterson
- Kevin Peterson.
You're sure?
How are you spelling it?
P- e-t-e-r...
- s-o-n.
Peterson.
- Peterson with an "O."
I'm not showing anyone in our system with that name.
Okay, well, he's definitely having surgery.
- Do you happen to-
- Orthopaedics.
Do you happen to remember the room number?
Yeah, it was right down the hall, actually.
This floor.
- What about the doctor's name?
- Room 714.
Harding.
Dr. Harding.
Dr. Harding's off today.
I'm sorry.
There's no one in our system with the name Kevin Peterson.
Well...
Are you sure it could have been in this hospital?
Perhaps it was in another hospital.
We've stopped doing outpatient procedures at this time.
Okay, I was here.
We drove together.
During pre-op, I was in the room with him.
- Lovely nurse came in to prep him.
- What was the nurse's name?
No, what was her name?
Amanda.
Amanda.
- Do you know her?
- Doesn't ring a bell.
Okay.
Maybe orthopaedics she's in.
Are you sure that he just didn't leave without you?
I have the keys.
I have the keys to the car.
Okay?
I just want to know where my boyfriend is.
Can you please help me find him?
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
He's not in our systems.
This is ridiculous.
Would you like me to page him for you?
Thank you.
That would be great.
Kevin Peterson, can you please dial 9 and come to the courtesy phone?
Kevin Peterson, please dial 9.
Kevin Peterson, please dial 9 at the courtesy phone.
Hey, this is Kevin.
Do your business after the beep.
Sweetheart.
Ma'am, you cannot use your cell phone.
- I'll be two seconds.
- You cannot use your cell phone.
I have this nurse that's driving me absolutely crazy.
I'm at the nurses' station on the floor that had a room- 714 was on the last place I saw you.
Right now it is- it's definitely been over an hour.
I can tell you that much.
It's been hours, and I've looked everywhere.
I can't find you.
The second you get this message, okay, you call me.
Okay, baby.
You call me, okay?
Love you.
I love you.
Hi, we met this morning.
You told me where to check in for outpatient surgery.
Kevin Peterson is a patient here.
- His doctor is Dr. Harding.
- Okay.
He is my boyfriend.
I can't find him anywhere.
- Do you remember me from earlier?
- I remember you.
- You were by yourself.
- I was.
I dropped him off in the parking structure, okay.
I don't make mix-ups, and my computer is giving me the correct information.
And there is no Kevin Peterson.
Perhaps it's new information, or something's changed.
I'm looking at my computer printout and I don't see a Kevin Peterson.
I heard you.
Okay.
Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Yes, can I help you?
Yes, please.
I'm looking for someone who's missing.
- Missing
- He's 35, 6'1", dark hair, dark eyes.
I haven't seen anybody by that description.
I'm sorry.
He's wearing a brace on his left leg.
Are you okay?
Ma'am, are you okay?
Excuse me.
Yeah, this is Holloway in the lobby.
Yeah, I've got a young woman who's looking for an unidentified male.
Hi, I'm looking for a patient that's in recovery named Kevin Peterson.
Never heard of him.
Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hi, excuse me.
Can I help you?
Hi, yes, I am looking for Kevin Peterson,
Dr. Harding's patient.
Great, I understand.
This is a restricted area.
- I think he's just back there.
- I understand, ma'am, but I need you to leave the restricted area.
He is an outpatient.
He's recovering.
This is recovery.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
I'm very busy right now.
I'm very sorry.
Okay.
- Hi.
- I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm with a patient.
Look, ma'am, I really need you to get out of this area.
Security, can you take her away, please?
Ma'am, this is a restricted area.
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
This is a restricted area.
You have to leave.
Can you please escort me to Dr. Harding instead?
Yes.
You have to get out of here.
It's a restricted area.
This is her.
And this is Miss Markham, our hospital administrator.
- Thank you.
Hi, thank God.
- How can I help you?
I'm Mary Walsh.
My boyfriend had surgery here this morning.
- He's missing.
- Missing?
- Yes.
- I told her there was no one who's checked into this hospital by the name of Kevin Peterson.
Okay, well, he had orthopaedic surgery-
A.C.L.- this morning.
His doctor is Dr. Harding.
Evidently, neither one of them are in your system.
And no one's in his room.
Okay, well, obviously there's been some kind of mistake.
That's what I've been trying to explain to you.
Come with me, please.
Let me see what we can do.
What time this morning was it that you and your boyfriend arrived?
About 7:15.
Surgery started at 8:00.
Okay, and you're the one
- who arrived here with him.
- Correct.
Okay.
Oh...
Rewind that a hair.
Wait, stop.
All right, these numbers don't-
These times don't coincide.
Keep fast-forwarding, please.
We weren't even out of bed yet.
Okay, keep going.
Okay, right here.
We were already here.
Back it up, please.
Okay, now... rewind it just a hair.
Wait, wait.
Wait, did you see that?
Turn it back.
Go back a bit.
Play it from this point.
Good.
Keep playing, please.
Pause!
That's him.
Right there.
That's him.
He's wearing the green and gray striped shirt.
Colour accuracy is difficult to determine on closed-circuit cameras.
You've got to be kidding me.
That's him.
He's right there.
Markham:
Miss Walsh.
Mary:
I'm looking at him, you know?
He may not be in your computer, but he's right on your security camera.
Do you have a copy of his hospital appointment record?
No, it was on him.
Oh God.
It might be in his computer bag in the car.
I will have my team look for him,
- but you know I'm understaffed.
- Yeah.
Where do you think you're going?
I'm goanna go call somebody who can actually help me out here.
I just didn't think there was anything conclusive on that.
Do what you can, but...
- You got it, Miss Markham.
- Thank you.
Yeah, come in.
Man:
Breathe in out, in... out.
- How is it, Doc?
- It's 160 over 100.
You still taking the medication?
Every day.
- What about work?
- What about it?
I don't know, Rich.
Something like this takes time.
You don't want to rush it.
Heaven forbid.
- I'm goanna increase the dosage though.
- Okay, thanks.
But I really need you to take it easy, man.
Whatever you say, Doc.
All right.
See you on Thursday?
- Wouldn't miss it.
- All right, take care.
- Franklin here.
- Woman:
This is dispatch.
We've got reports of a missing person at County Memorial.
- Are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm still here.
What floor?
Mary:
When I arrived, he wasn't in his room.
So I went down to the waiting room and waited there for a good couple of hours.
Started getting increasingly concerned and went back to his floor and spoke with the head nurse and learned for the first time that he was not in the computer system.
We have looked.
No one by the name of Kevin Peterson was scheduled for anything today, not even a check-up.
What about the nurse, this Amanda?
We don't have anyone on staff by that name,
- and the doctor that he was supposedly-
- Dr. Harding.
scheduled with is on vacation.
Look, if you could just access Kevin's insurance records.
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.
Why?
The insurance company will only release information to the policyholder's spouse.
Okay, but this is an emergency situation.
He's missing.
I'm sorry.
The hospital can't release any information to a non-family member without a court order.
Detective...
I'm getting really really worried that something bad's happened to him.
Can you please help me?
Okay, first of all,
I can't file a report for 24 hours.
24 hours?
I'll be honest with you, Miss Walsh, most of the time we get a call saying a spouse or boyfriend or whatever is missing, usually they just up and left.
Have you considered the possibility that your boyfriend might have walked out on you?
I could see how you two would think that, but that's just not him, no.
- How long have you been together?
- Four months.
Markham:
That's not a lot of time to get to know someone.
Maybe your relationship isn't what you thought it was.
No, I trust him.
Detective Franklin:
Do you have a picture?
Maybe, wait.
I think.
Hold on, I think I do.
Yeah, right here.
Can you make anything out?
Markham:
No.
Well, it's not the best picture.
It's something.
How about a description?
He's 6'0", maybe 6'1".
Around 190.
Brown hair.
Brown eyes.
He was wearing a green and gray shirt today and shorts because he has on a huge leg brace.
And he was using a crutch.
Shirt was long-sleeved.
Security has their people searching the entire hospital and no one has seen anyone matching that description.
I'll see what I can find.
In the meantime, I need you to sit right here.
I feel very awkward just not doing anything and staying here.
Miss Walsh, the more cooperation I can get from you, the faster this can go for everyone.
All right?
Okay?
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
If you hear anything, give me a call.
- Anything I can do to help.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.
Will you excuse me for a minute?
Yes, of course.
Have you seen a male Caucasian, mid 30s, dark hair, wearing dark shorts, green sweatshirt?
Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to recall seeing a male Caucasian mid 30s, wearing a gray-striped hoodie with shorts?
- No.
- Okay, thank you.
Could you tell me where the outpatient surgery is?
Yeah, if you just keep going straight down the hall you'll run right into it.
Woman:
Can I help you, sir?
Yeah, I couldn't help but notice there are no patients on this level.
Yeah, everyone's been moved to another facility.
They are shutting this entire hospital down Saturday for renovation.
You mean no one has been in any of these rooms today?
No.
Are you looking for someone?
I'm fine, thanks.
You wouldn't happen to know of a nurse named Amanda, would you?
Amanda?
No.
- No, no one.
- Are you sure?
I'm the head nurse.
I would know.
- Thanks.
- Have a good day.
Franklin:
Excuse me, I'm looking for a patient by the name of Kevin Peterson...
Excuse me, I'm looking for a guy, mid 30s, 6' tall- Kevin Peterson.
He's wearing a striped hoodie.
You wouldn't happen to recall seeing a male Caucasian, mid 30s, wearing a gray-striped hoodie with shorts?
- Woman:
No.
- Kevin Peterson checked in, mid 30s.
I'm looking for a patient by the name of Kevin Peterson...
By the name of Kevin Peterson...
Kevin Peterson, checked in today.
- Gray-striped hoodie with shorts...
- Woman:
No.
Woman:
Look, I just clock in and I clock out.
You do not recall hearing the name Kevin Peterson today?
Is that right?
Woman:
No.
Mary:
Chris, I'm in the security room at the hospital.
I took Kevin in and he's missing.
Look, slow down, okay?
You're scaring me.
What's going on?
Nobody just disappears.
No, he is missing.
I haven't seen him since the surgery.
I feel like I'm going crazy.
What are you talking about?
Saw him in pre-op.
Boom, went back to the room, gone.
He's not even in the computer system.
He's missing.
Okay, sweetie, you know, you just met Kevin.
Maybe...
He didn't leave me, honey.
Oh my God, sweetheart.
I'm not saying that he left you.
I know we've only been together for four months, but I have been waiting for him my whole entire life.
And I'm not goanna let someone take him away from me.
Okay, do you want me to come there?
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to call the police?
You're scaring me.
No, I already called the police.
That's why the detective's here.
I think I hear somebody coming.
Everybody's acting really strange.
There's something real off here.
I think they're all crazy.
Or I'm the crazy one.
So please, please, just keep checking in.
If I don't answer, come find me, okay?
I'm having the hardest time writing on this.
Oh, here, lean on this.
Ahh.
Thank you.
- So what's going on?
- What's going on?
Well, Miss Walsh,
Detective Franklin is out looking for your boyfriend.
It's been over an hour.
It's a big hospital.
You know, I think I'm goanna look myself.
Listen, I can't have you doing that.
I can't have you walking around the hallway scaring other patients.
Do you understand?
- Hi.
- I've been to all seven floors and not a single person has seen him.
Okay, um...
Then please, I have to file a report.
I told you he needs to be missing for 24 hours.
24 hours is too long.
Anything can happen in 24 hours.
Please, file a report.
What does Kevin do for a living?
He's in insurance.
Well, at least he's covered.
Have you ever been to his office?
Meet any of his colleagues?
No, he's freelance.
He works from the house.
But I did, while you were gone, jot this down for you.
Wait, you just happened to remember it?
I'd appreciate it if you ran it.
I'll see what I can do.
In the meantime, is there anybody else I could talk to?
Anybody who knew he'd be here today?
- What about family?
- Ooh!
His mother.
She lives in Florida, but he was goanna put her number into my phone in case of an emergency.
I just totally forgot.
Thank you.
Okay.
Wait.
The number you have reached is not in service at this time.
- There is no new number.
- No luck.
He must have input a wrong digit.
He's always been bad electronically.
Shoot!
You need proof.
You need some sort of evidence that this is real, that he actually exists, don't you?
- Antidepressants.
- I, uh-
I have a prescription for that, so...
Holloway:
That kind of says it all, doesn't it?
Please hand that to me.
I'll be right back, Mr. Holloway.
Where are you going?
May I have my medication back, please?
Detective Franklin, we have people here she can talk to.
I'm sure Miss Markham could arrange something.
All right, I'll run the Social.
I'll be back.
You got it.
Come on.
- Wait wait.
- Just stay out of the way.
Come on.
Your brace.
Do you want your bag?
No, just leave it in the back.
That's fine.
Thank God.
Where is it?
Okay, want to come upstairs now?
Shoot!
Holloway:
It's not under the seat.
Shoot!
I Wanna come upstairs now?
- It's not here.
- What's not here?
His bag.
It has his computer in it, all of his information- everything.
Somebody had to have gotten into the car.
What makes you think that?
Because the bag was here this morning.
Now it's not.
- It was right there.
- Miss Walsh, we need to speak with you.
Now.
I have the only set of keys.
Now.
We're in the middle of a huge transition.
I've got patients to move, equipment to transport.
Every minute that I or my security team spends chasing phantoms on surveillance cameras or finding you trespassing in a restricted area is one less minute we're able to do our jobs.
Every minute you don't spending looking for Kevin is a minute wasted.
Mary, I checked seven floors of this building.
I checked with every nurse's station.
I checked the emergency room.
I checked the intensive care ward.
What about the wing that's being renovated?
Franklin:
Yes.
- And?
- And no one reported seeing your boyfriend.
No one can even confirm that he was in this hospital.
Just what do you suppose happened to him?
- I don't know.
- Holloway:
Look, there are 23 exits in this facility.
Six are manned by my men.
Eight are alarmed and the rest are carefully monitored by cameras.
If anyone left this building under any manner of duress we would know about it.
Well, obviously, you're not looking hard enough.
- Detective...
- Detective Franklin.
- Detective, who is it?
- Really?
Okay, thank you.
What did they say?
We ran the Social Security number you gave me.
Good, okay, what's the next step?
It belongs to a 50-year-old African-American woman.
Well, that's obviously a mistake.
Not ours.
I ran the number you gave us.
No, that's impossible.
Okay, run them again, please?
Dr. Bensley, thank you for joining us.
I'd like to introduce you to someone.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello.
Markham:
Dr. Bensley is our hospital psychiatrist.
I don't need a psychiatrist.
Did you get the prescription I sent over?
I did.
Quite a potent dosage, Mary.
Would you mind coming with me for a moment?
Yes, actually, I would.
It doesn't need to be voluntary, Miss Walsh.
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
Right this way, please.
This way.
- Okay.
- Come on.
So you've been treated for psychiatric issues before, hmm, Mary?
Answer the question, Miss Walsh.
I...
I checked myself in when I was 22.
I was in grade school.
I was under a lot of stress.
I was there for three days.
That's it.
I don't see how that's relevant.
What are you doing on antidepressants?
Oh, you think I'm making this up.
You think that, what, my imaginary boyfriend went missing?
You're an only child.
Your father left when you were young.
Your mother died earlier this year in a hospital.
Yes, February.
She went in for a routine check-up and never checked out.
She had a blood infection.
So it's not surprising that your subconscious would choose a hospital to fabricate-
It's not my subconscious anything.
Oh my Lord!
This is real.
He was there for me.
You know, I remember her funeral.
- He was at it.
- Kevin?
Yes, Kevin.
I know it's hard to lose somebody you care deeply about, Mary.
It's very understandable how someone in your situation could suffer a psychological break.
You work long hours.
You've lost your emotional support system.
You're alone.
It's only natural for the brain to reach for something, anything, to grab onto.
He drove us here.
He did.
And I remember the ride like the back of my hand.
He- he- he was-
He was chewing on the lid of his coffee cup.
- It's this little nervous habit that he has.
- Sorry.
I know that it all must seem real.
It seems real because it is real!
I remember walking through the parking structure.
Memory is a very vivid and powerful sensation, Mary.
It is real!
This whole situation is real.
And he's here.
He was here,
He's somewhere right now in this hospital and we're wasting time!
The nurse advised me to get coffee, said the surgery would be an hour.
It was 25 minutes, and he's gone.
It was real.
It's all right, Mary.
Can I just have a moment alone?
Take all the time you need, dear.
I'll be in my office next door.
Okay.
Mary, I-
Security.
Want some company?
Do you know I was just here for a check up today?
Doctor told me I need to take it easy.
Then you call.
I got to tell you, this job can really take its toll on you- your health, your marriage.
You're married?
Was.
Marriage, it can be a funny thing, you know?
You commit yourself, you hand your heart over to someone, but it always seems like it's the little things that keep chipping away at it-
Little disagreements.
She- she hated the fact that I was a cop.
And you know what?
Maybe- maybe she was right.
I don't know.
I was working a gang shooting over in Glassell Park, and my partner and I, we traced the shooter back to his girlfriend's house.
He'd been shacking up there for a couple of weeks.
And we had the kid cornered, so we went in.
He was unarmed, gave himself right up.
What we didn't know that his girlfriend was in the house.
The last thing I remember before I blacked out... was watching my partner... his dark lifeless eyes as he fell to the floor.
Now look at me.
I've got a desk job and high blood pressure and a doctor telling me how to live my life.
What I'm- what I'm trying to say here is that...
I understand what you're going through.
Can you please tell Dr. Bensley that... he can just do whatever needs to do, all right?
Mary's behaviour is definitely indicative of someone in the midst of an emotional breakdown.
And yet I never met anyone with such conviction in her delusion.
She absolutely believes that everything that's happening is real.
She's emotionally lost.
Yeah, this Bensley.
Listen, I want to put Mary Walsh under 72-hour observation.
Mm-hmm.
Possible mental illness.
Mr. Holloway, this is J.J.
I have her in the hallway.
Switching to camera 2.
I'm following her along the hallway.
I have her.
- Do not lose her.
Sir, it looks like she's heading towards sublevel "B"- boiler room and laundry.
We only have limited coverage down there.
I'm en route right now.
Dr. Bensley, what are we dealing with here?
Is she dangerous?
It's impossible to say.
Acute perception of persecution, paranoia.
You just never know how someone like this will act when pushed too far.
No, no.
No cameras, none.
No parking lot.
No exits.
No.
I can't find her anywhere.
We only got a couple of cameras operational in that area, so it's not goanna be easy.
I'm goanna keep on scanning.
Wait, I think I've got something.
Boom!
Camera 4 in the boiler room.
She's wearing blue scrubs.
It looks like she's heading towards the morgue.
She's running.
She's on the move.
I'm goanna lose her.
You had a chance to talk with her.
Is she currently on meds?
Yeah, quite a potent dosage.
Okay, so this could be some sort of psychotic reaction.
It could indeed.
Hello.
Kevin:
Hello, it's me.
My God, Kevin.
Where are you?
I don't know.
Somewhere in the hospital.
What's happening?
Listen to me, okay?
Don't trust anyone.
I don't know how many people are involved in this.
It's very important, okay?
- What do they want?
- I don't know.
She has to be close by.
She couldn't have gone too far.
Check all the rooms on that wing.
Look around you.
Where are you?
Where are you right now?
I'm in a bathroom somewhere.
Are you okay?
Are you safe?
Where are you?
I don't- hold on.
Um...
I'm in the morgue.
- Can you get down here?
- No, no!
Leave me alone!
Kevin.
Kevin.
Kevin!
Kevin.
Miss Walsh.
Miss Walsh, you in here?
I got her.
She's heading towards the parking garage.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
This is a first date.
- We don't kiss on the first date.
- Third.
Fifth date.
Goanna wait?
This could take awhile.
I think I've done all I can do.
Sorry she sent you on such a wild goose chase.
Yeah, it happens.
- Good afternoon, Doc.
- Detective.
Cooper:
Hi, Mary.
- Hello.
- Shh.
I heard what happened.
These are for you.
Hey, it's goanna be okay.
The doctor thought you needed some more time to recuperate.
The cop
- I think he might have left.
Thank you.
They think I'm crazy.
I'm not.
I'm not crazy.
No, you're not crazy.
That's why I came down here.
I want to discuss the situation about Kevin and how you could see him again.
You do want to see him again, right?
Do you know where he is?
Now don't get yourself worked up, young lady.
You did make quite a spectacle of yourself, Miss Walsh.
The emotional outburst, the panicking.
We expected that, but the accident.
Oh, my my, Mary, I mean, you've got to be more careful.
"Mary Catherine Walsh, unmarried, regional operations manager for the Empyrean International Bank. "
You rent a condo in Reseda.
Your mother died four months ago, but the bank got your house in the reverse mortgage.
That's true.
- How do you know this?
- I did my research.
But your bank, on the other hand, recently received from the federal government a $2 billion bailout.
Now I've seen the bonus structure, rewarding their executives while letting their customers go bankrupt, huh?
And you have access to unlimited funds.
Don't you hurt him.
Don't you hurt him!
So...
- How much?
- $10 million.
I've taken the liberty to get Kevin's computer.
Inside here you'll find the account and wire routing numbers of a bank account in the Cayman Islands.
Once I receive confirmation of funds received,
I'll let your boyfriend go.
Shit.
I have no Wi-Fi signal.
I checked it myself.
It's fine.
Yeah, I don't have a wireless signal in this room.
I need a hard line.
I need to move to a different location.
Yeah, it's me.
Yeah, cut off Peterson's finger.
No, wait!
Wait!
Tell him no.
Look at this right here.
This is our signal.
There is none.
I've tried every single network,
- and there's nothing.
- Hold that for one second.
I need you to move me to a place where I can plug in a different computer.
I can get it done in no time, okay?
Yeah, all right.
I've got 26 minutes till the cut off, which is exactly how much time you've got to find a computer to get me my money.
You're being watched.
We know everything you do.
If you fail, Kevin dies.
If you tell anyone, Kevin dies.
If you leave the hospital, Kevin dies.
Got it.
Here's your clothing.
I found it downstairs.
Meet me on sublevel "B" when you're done.
Wonderful.
Miss Walsh?
Mr. Holloway, that crazy Mary Walsh lady is back wandering the halls.
She's looking for a patient that does not appear to be in our system.
She needs be escorted out immediately.
- I'll alert Miss Markham.
- Thank you.
We have footage of Miss Walsh in the trauma recovery room.
J.J., punch up everything on level 3, would you, please?
- Thank you.
- You got it.
- Holloway:
There you go.
- I wanted somebody on that door.
Unfortunately, the nurse stepped away.
You don't really think she's dangerous, do you?
I'm not taking any chances.
Besides, with her injuries, her well-being is my responsibility.
Trust me.
She's still here, and we will find her.
I have my people turning this place upside down.
Well, let me know the minute you hear anything.
I'm going back upstairs.
You got it, Miss Markham.
Thank you.
$10 million.
$10 million.
Please work.
Hello.
Mary:
Kevin.
- Mary, Mary.
- Oh, Kevin.
Are you hurt?
He's fine.
Let him go.
- The receipt.
- I need to email a confirmation code to complete the wire transfer.
So I would suggest that you let him go now.
Move it!
Honey.
I thought I lost you forever.
The code, come on!
Done.
Come on, let's go up those stairs.
We could get away.
Just go right up those stairs.
Well, I'm glad you made it safely.
I understand you're from Missouri.
Is that correct?
Yeah, Kansas City.
- Is that near St. Louis?
- Other side of the state.
Excuse me one second.
Royal Cayman Bank Trust.
This is Barry.
Yeah, Conyers.
Yeah, it's me.
Did it go through?
Yes, sir.
As a matter of fact, it's pending right now.
We're on, guys.
Thank you, Miss Walsh.
Great work, baby.
I mean, fantastic.
Kevin:
It's a good thing too.
Just in time, 'cause this brace is really starting to make my leg really stiff.
Kevin, what are you doing?
Cooper:
Haven't you been paying any attention?
There is no Kevin Peterson.
Kevin.
Oh my God.
Where are you?
I don't know.
I'm in the hospital somewhere.
Can you get down here?
- No, no, leave me alone!
- Kevin.
There is no...
Kevin Peterson.
Kevin, Kevin!
Kevin.
Don't you hurt him.
Don't you hurt him.
Oh, my.
So how much?
Franklin:
What about the nurse, this Amanda?
- So you must be Kevin Peterson.
- Yeah.
- I'm Amanda.
- Markham:
We don't have anyone
- by that name.
- See you in an hour.
- Mary:
Lovely nurse came in to prep him.
- What was the nurse's name?
Mary:
Uh, no...
Amanda.
- My boyfriend is Kevin Peterson...
- Come here, come here.
...and we can't find him.
My wife, she has breast cancer.
Well, she's up in chemo.
That's him right there.
Colour accuracy is difficult to determine with closed-circuit cameras.
You know, Detective Franklin, we have people here she can talk to.
I'm sure Miss Markham could arrange something, if need be.
Mary:
Everything is a lie?
Everything is a lie?
Every- every- everything everything is a lie.
- Don't take it personally, Mare.
- Mare bear.
- Don't touch me.
The man you fell in love with... he's not real.
I'm a real idiot.
Didn't he tell you about his time in prison?
That's where I met the guy.
Believe me, if I was any younger, I would have done this myself.
No no no, Coop.
You couldn't handle her.
She's a real tiger cat between the sheets.
Oh, I don't know, Coop.
I think you could have handled her.
Holloway:
All we had to do was sit back and watch you lose it.
It was simple.
Mare bear, for old times' sake.
- Come on in.
- Don't you dare touch me.
- Don't touch me.
- Allow me.
Boys, I think it's time to go.
All right, Holloway, you know the drill.
Amanda.
I'll send you a postcard.
I'm sorry.
Victoria Markham's office, please.
It's Detective Franklin.
Tell her it's urgent.
What do you mean she disappeared?
Where'd she go?
Look, I think she's telling us the truth about her boyfriend.
She's messed up in something.
I don't know what it is.
I think she's in some kind of trouble.
Just find her.
Just find her!
I'm on my way there right now.
Whoo!
$10 million feels good, doesn't it, babe?
Baby, gimme a kiss.
You know, I almost feel bad.
Amanda:
Oh, yeah, why is that?
Almost, but I can think of 10 million reasons why not.
Come on!
Up!
Get up those stairs.
Come on!
Don't fight me!
Yeah, you're a fighter, ain't you?
I believe Stevie once said you were an animal in bed.
Easy easy.
Shh!
Yeah.
Damn, you're fine.
I want to show you something.
- All right.
- Yeah.
Maybe I shouldn't let you go just yet.
What are you reaching for down there?
- It's my phone.
- What about your phone?
The transfer.
You know they were talking about the transfer?
Yeah, what about it?
It's still pending.
Really?
You pulling another one of your tiger moves?
- Is that it?
- I could take that money and I could transfer it right into your account with just the click of a button.
What do you mean I could have the money?
I'll prove it to you.
I'll do it right here.
Look.
Slowly, do it slowly.
Let me see.
Oh!
Mary, where's my little lamb?
Mary!
Where you at?
Holloway:
Mary!
Mary.
We got 23 exits.
We checked 22.
Really?
You think I did a good job?
Yes, you in the naughty nurse's outfit was really something.
Thanks, baby.
I was so nervous.
Hey, look, don't get too excited.
- Give Holloway a call.
- All right.
Kevin:
Hello, Holloway.
Sounds like you're out of breath.
Mare bear... is that you?
I can hear you breathing.
And I know your breath.
Where's Holloway?
You didn't kill Holloway, did you?
I didn't know you had it in you.
Mary.
Mary, listen to me.
I'm coming for you, Mary.
I'm coming down there.
You just stay put, sweets.
We can sort this all out.
I'm coming for you.
Damn it!
Holloway screwed up.
She's not dead.
Just relax.
I'll get the money, okay?
We'll get the money!
I thought you said you knew this chick, Steve.
I do.
I told you, she's smart.
- Hello.
- Barry:
I'm afraid there's been a problem.
The wire's been reversed.
Cooper:
What are you talking about?
The bank recalled the money.
Can't do that.
- It's not my call, sir.
- That's not good enough.
Sir, there's nothing more that I can do, okay?
It's not on my end.
I did what you told me to do.
- I did what you asked me to do.
- I'll get them to rescind it.
Sir, do whatever you have to do, sir.
I'm sorry.
We got to go back.
Get us back to the hospital.
I'll take care of it myself.
I'll put a bullet in her head right now.
Turn around here.
Son of a bitch!
There she is!
End of the road, baby.
All right, you take the wheel.
Meet us topside.
Woman:
All units, three armed suspects spotted in hospital parking garage driving silver sedan.
All units respond.
Shh shh shh.
Wait wait.
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.
- Where'd they go?
- They went that way.
- Chill out!
- You stay right here.
You hear me?
Right here!
I need backup at County Hospital now.
Mary honey, I'm not goanna hurt you.
Mare bear.
No!
No, don't hit her.
We need her information.
Honey, Mary.
He's sorry.
Mare.
Mary:
Please stop!
Cooper, put the gun down.
You're a smart girl, Walsh.
There's no good way out of this.
Don't be stupid.
I'm goanna put my gun down.
I'm goanna do it right here.
I'll go my way.
You go yours, okay?
Drop your weapon, Cooper.
Coop... you okay?
Kevin:
Whoa whoa whoa!
Where'd you get a gun, honey?
Put it away.
Stay where you are.
Whoa whoa whoa.
Baby, I'll put this away.
Take it easy.
This is a whole different side of you
I've never seen.
And how do you feel about that side?
I like it.
I like it a lot.
Me too.
Baby, this whole thing has gotten completely out of hand.
You were never supposed to get hurt.
Okay?
Look, we can work this out.
Okay, listen, forget these guys, okay?
Why don't you and I just take the money?
You can resend it.
We'll take it.
We can be anybody we want to be.
We can go anywhere we want to go.
Think about that.
No no no, it started off about money, but now, I mean, honey, everything's changed.
I would hate for you to see four months of wasted time and effort.
I would really hate it.
It would hurt me.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
So you and I, we could take the money together.
Right here.
And it could happen just with the push of a little button.
We can go anywhere we want to.
We can be anybody we want to.
Think about it.
Baby, that sounds pretty fantastic.
You... always told me I was priceless.
Baby, you are priceless... to me.
Just didn't know that I was a $10 million catch!
No!
Mary.
See now, I'm goanna have to break up with you.
For real!
Mare!
Mary.
Mary, don't move.
Stay right there!
Don't move.
I'm goanna come to you.
You're okay.
Stay right there.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
- Detective Franklin.
- Mm-hmm.
Before we go up there and see all those people,
I just wanted to ask, why did you believe me?
This.
You left it in the chapel.
What about this?
The last chapter.
Take a look.
The whole thing, it's right there.
Couldn't even come up with something original.
Why don't you keep this for evidence?
- You goanna be okay?
- Sure I am.
Goanna just keep on living one day at a time.
- How about you?
- I called my wife.
- You did?
- You got me thinking.
Maybe I let her go too easily.
I am proud of you, kid.
Come on.
Let's get you to a real hospital.
- Okay?
- Then the games can really begin.
Sorry.
It's going to be okay.
Just don't think about it.
Yeah.
I just hate hospitals.
- Dang it.
- What?
I left my book at the house.
You know, in case we have to wait.
Shoot!
Um....
I'll look in my purse.
You rock.
You left it on the table.
Thank you.
Promise me you're not gonna leave, all right?
You're not gonna take off when they put me under.
I promise.
I would never leave.
Woman:
Isn't that always the way it works?
Man:
You'd think you see somebody with a crutch, they're gonna help 'em out.
Right, naturally.
Don't even hold the door.
All right, you stay there, please.
Give me one moment.
I can at least get out.
Let me just get the crutch.
Wait, wait.
- I can just stand.
- Come on.
The brace.
You're awesome.
- I love you.
Be careful.
- Love you.
Thank you.
- I'll be right up.
- All right.
Woman #2:
What's this I hear about you taking the morning off?
Woman:
Kevin has orthopedic surgery today.
Aww!
You're such a good girlfriend.
I told you about it.
He's always there for me.
He's amazing.
I think the bank could go one day without me.
You don't mind covering, right?
Of course.
Of course.
So when do I get to meet him?
- I don't know.
- It's been fours months.
- I'm back.
I wanna meet him.
- I know.
I just have never been in a relationship before where it's actually going well.
- How can I help you?
- Hi, where's outpatient surgery?
- Squeezed you in under the wire, huh?
- What do you mean?
We're shutting down for renovations on Saturday.
Most of our patients have already been moved to County West.
- Oh.
- Go through those doors and take the elevator up.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
Tell him we'll give him an extra basis point.
If he's worried about the rates and us not being competitive, tell him to just look at our rates.
Listen, Craig's been on this case.
Just have him deal with it.
If you have any questions, call Craig.
Okay, bye.
Hi.
Hey, baby.
Any trouble parking?
No, but I did finally speak with Christine, who wants us all to grab a pizza this weekend.
Her words.
All of us.
- The best friend that I never get to meet?
- Yes.
That's a biggie.
"Heart disease?" No.
"Rheumatic fever?" No.
- "Snoring?"
- Sometimes.
- Really?
- Yeah.
So you're sure you're okay with this whole introduction thing to your friends?
That's a big step.
No.
Every time I introduce her to anybody, it's sort of bad luck.
Well, don't you worry.
Because you are not gonna lose me.
Ever.
"Social Security number"?
I've been having the hardest time writing on this.
Oh, here, lean on this.
Ahh.
Thank you.
So you must be Kevin Peterson.
- I am.
- I'm Amanda.
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Mary.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Dr. Harding will be in in a moment so I just wanna check some things out.
Okay.
- It's all done.
- Thank you.
Does your wife mind waiting outside?
Oh, well, we're not married.
I don't mind.
Do you have a place I could grab a coffee?
We have a cafeteria attached to the lobby downstairs.
Perfect.
Thank you.
You gonna be okay?
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.
Don't leave me though, right?
- Promise?
- I promise.
Cross my heart, promise.
Okay.
You take care of him.
Oh, how long will it be?
- About an hour.
- An hour?
Really?
- Yep.
- Well, good luck.
Thank you.
See you in an hour.
Just tell him that he has to sign the request form in person.
Yeah, he has to come in.
He already knows that.
Just do it.
I'll tell him if I have to.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Let him know I'll call him back this afternoon.
I'll call you back, bye.
- Let me please.
- Thank you.
Sorry.
There's a garbage...
- Yeah.
- Right there and another one.
Oh, thanks a lot.
- I'm Cooper, by the way.
- Cooper, I'm Mary.
- Mary.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- You want some company?
- Sure.
Well, okay.
So what are you-
- What am I in for?
- I wasn't going to say it quite like that, but yes.
My wife, she has breast cancer, and well, she's up in chemo.
How's it going?
I'm sorry.
Small improvement.
We're keeping our fingers crossed.
- So we'll see what happens.
- I'm sorry.
What about you?
You're not here for the coffee, right?
I'm just here for the day.
My boyfriend's having orthopedic surgery.
He tore his A.C.L.
hiking and flared up an old football injury.
He hurt himself, huh?
Yep.
Keep telling him to take it easy.
You don't like hospitals, do you?
Does anybody like hospitals?
Except for the doctors and nurses?
I've been doing this every week for six months.
And I can't wait till they shut this place down.
- Believe you me.
- Sorry.
Wow, look at you go.
It's my job.
MIT said that 90% of people who use smartphones feel more stress.
Only 90%?
I mean, look at you.
You're sitting in a hospital waiting for your boyfriend, and you're working.
What happened to the days where you could say,
"I'm out of the office," you know?
Well, sir, to the good old days.
- Cheers, Mary.
- Cheers.
Kevin.
Man over P.A.:
Monica Hernandez, your party is ready in post-op.
Jeanette Stevens, Mary Turner, your parties are ready.
- May I help you?
- Yes, please.
Hi.
My boyfriend was having surgery, and I just want to see how much longer it's going to be.
Certainly.
What was his name?
Peterson
- Kevin Peterson.
You're sure?
How are you spelling it?
P-e-t-e-r...
- s-o-n.
Peterson.
- Peterson with an "O."
I'm not showing anyone in our system with that name.
Okay, well, he's definitely having surgery.
- Do you happen to-
- Orthopedics.
Do you happen to remember the room number?
Yeah, it was right down the hall, actually.
This floor.
- What about the doctor's name?
- Room 714.
Harding.
Dr. Harding.
Dr. Harding's off today.
I'm sorry.
There's no one in our system with the name Kevin Peterson.
Well...
Are you sure it could have been in this hospital?
Perhaps it was in another hospital.
We've stopped doing outpatient procedures at this time.
Okay, I was here.
We drove together.
During pre-op, I was in the room with him.
- Lovely nurse came in to prep him.
- What was the nurse's name?
No, what was her name?
Amanda.
Amanda.
- Do you know her?
- Doesn't ring a bell.
Okay.
Maybe orthopedics she's in.
Are you sure that he just didn't leave without you?
I have the keys.
I have the keys to the car.
Okay?
I just wanna know where my boyfriend is.
Can you please help me find him?
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
He's not in our systems.
This is ridiculous.
Would you like me to page him for you?
Thank you.
That would be great.
Kevin Peterson, can you please dial 9 and come to the courtesy phone?
Kevin Peterson, please dial 9.
Kevin Peterson, please dial 9 at the courtesy phone.
Hey, this is Kevin.
Do your business after the beep.
Sweetheart.
Ma'am, you cannot use your cell phone.
- I'll be two seconds.
- You cannot use your cell phone.
I have this nurse that's driving me absolutely crazy.
I'm at the nurses' station on the floor that had a room- 714 was on the last place I saw you.
Right now it is- it's definitely been over an hour.
I can tell you that much.
It's been hours, and I've looked everywhere.
I can't find you.
The second you get this message, okay, you call me.
Okay, baby.
You call me, okay?
Love you.
I love you.
Hi, we met this morning.
You told me where to check in for outpatient surgery.
Kevin Peterson is a patient here.
- His doctor is Dr. Harding.
- Okay.
He is my boyfriend.
I can't find him anywhere.
- Do you remember me from earlier?
- I remember you.
- You were by yourself.
- I was.
I dropped him off in the parking structure, okay.
I don't make mix-ups, and my computer is giving me the correct information.
And there is no Kevin Peterson.
Perhaps it's new information, or something's changed.
I'm looking at my computer printout and I don't see a Kevin Peterson.
I heard you.
Okay.
Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Yes, can I help you?
Yes, please.
I'm looking for someone who's missing.
- Missing
- He's 35, 6'1", dark hair, dark eyes.
I haven't seen anybody by that description.
I'm sorry.
He's wearing a brace on his left leg.
Are you okay?
Ma'am, are you okay?
Excuse me.
Yeah, this is Holloway in the lobby.
Yeah, I've got a young woman who's looking for an unidentified male.
Hi, I'm looking for a patient that's in recovery named Kevin Peterson.
Never heard of him.
Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hi, excuse me.
Can I help you?
Hi, yes, I am looking for Kevin Peterson,
Dr. Harding's patient.
Great, I understand.
This is a restricted area.
- I think he's just back there.
- I understand, ma'am, but I need you to leave the restricted area.
He is an outpatient.
He's recovering.
This is recovery.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
I'm very busy right now.
I'm very sorry.
Okay.
- Hi.
- I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm with a patient.
Look, ma'am, I really need you to get out of this area.
Security, can you take her away, please?
Ma'am, this is a restricted area.
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
This is a restricted area.
You have to leave.
Can you please escort me to Dr. Harding instead?
Yes.
You have to get out of here.
It's a restricted area.
This is her.
And this is Miss Markham, our hospital administrator.
- Thank you.
Hi, thank God.
- How can I help you?
I'm Mary Walsh.
My boyfriend had surgery here this morning.
- He's missing.
- Missing?
- Yes.
- I told her there was no one who's checked into this hospital by the name of Kevin Peterson.
Okay, well, he had orthopedic surgery-
A.C.L.- this morning.
His doctor is Dr. Harding.
Evidently, neither one of them are in your system.
And no one's in his room.
Okay, well, obviously there's been some kind of mistake.
That's what I've been trying to explain to you.
Come with me, please.
Let me see what we can do.
What time this morning was it that you and your boyfriend arrived?
About 7:15.
Surgery started at 8:00.
Okay, and you're the one
- who arrived here with him.
- Correct.
Okay.
Oh...
Rewind that a hair.
Wait, stop.
All right, these numbers don't-
These times don't coincide.
Keep fast-forwarding, please.
We weren't even out of bed yet.
Okay, keep going.
Okay, right here.
We were already here.
Back it up, please.
Okay, now... rewind it just a hair.
Wait, wait.
Wait, did you see that?
Turn it back.
Go back a bit.
Play it from this point.
Good.
Keep playing, please.
Pause!
That's him.
Right there.
That's him.
He's wearing the green and gray striped shirt.
Color accuracy is difficult to determine on closed-circuit cameras.
You've gotta be kidding me.
That's him.
He's right there.
Markham:
Miss Walsh.
Mary:
I'm looking at him, you know?
He may not be in your computer, but he's right on your security camera.
Do you have a copy of his hospital appointment record?
No, it was on him.
Oh God.
It might be in his computer bag in the car.
I will have my team look for him,
- but you know I'm understaffed.
- Yeah.
Where do you think you're going?
I'm gonna go call somebody who can actually help me out here.
I just didn't think there was anything conclusive on that.
Do what you can, but...
- You got it, Miss Markham.
- Thank you.
Yeah, come in.
Man:
Breathe in out, in... out.
- How is it, Doc?
- It's 160 over 100.
You still taking the medication?
Every day.
- What about work?
- What about it?
I don't know, Rich.
Something like this takes time.
You don't wanna rush it.
Heaven forbid.
- I'm gonna increase the dosage though.
- Okay, thanks.
But I really need you to take it easy, man.
Whatever you say, Doc.
All right.
See you on Thursday?
- Wouldn't miss it.
- All right, take care.
- Franklin here.
- Woman:
This is dispatch.
We've got reports of a missing person at County Memorial.
- Are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm still here.
What floor?
Mary:
When I arrived, he wasn't in his room.
So I went down to the waiting room and waited there for a good couple of hours.
Started getting increasingly concerned and went back to his floor and spoke with the head nurse and learned for the first time that he was not in the computer system.
We have looked.
No one by the name of Kevin Peterson was scheduled for anything today, not even a check-up.
What about the nurse, this Amanda?
We don't have anyone on staff by that name,
- and the doctor that he was supposedly-
- Dr. Harding.
scheduled with is on vacation.
Look, if you could just access Kevin's insurance records.
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.
Why?
The insurance company will only release information to the policyholder's spouse.
Okay, but this is an emergency situation.
He's missing.
I'm sorry.
The hospital can't release any information to a non-family member without a court order.
Detective...
I'm getting really really worried that something bad's happened to him.
Can you please help me?
Okay, first of all,
I can't file a report for 24 hours.
24 hours?
I'll be honest with you, Miss Walsh, most of the time we get a call saying a spouse or boyfriend or whatever is missing, usually they just up and left.
Have you considered the possibility that your boyfriend might have walked out on you?
I could see how you two would think that, but that's just not him, no.
- How long have you been together?
- Four months.
Markham:
That's not a lot of time to get to know someone.
Maybe your relationship isn't what you thought it was.
No, I trust him.
Detective Franklin:
Do you have a picture?
Maybe, wait.
I think.
Hold on, I think I do.
Yeah, right here.
Can you make anything out?
Markham:
No.
Well, it's not the best picture.
It's something.
How about a description?
He's 6'0", maybe 6'1".
Around 190.
Brown hair.
Brown eyes.
He was wearing a green and gray shirt today and shorts because he has on a huge leg brace.
And he was using a crutch.
Shirt was long-sleeved.
Security has their people searching the entire hospital and no one has seen anyone matching that description.
I'll see what I can find.
In the meantime, I need you to sit right here.
I feel very awkward just not doing anything and staying here.
Miss Walsh, the more cooperation I can get from you, the faster this can go for everyone.
All right?
Okay?
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
If you hear anything, give me a call.
- Anything I can do to help.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.
Will you excuse me for a minute?
Yes, of course.
Have you seen a male Caucasian, mid 30s, dark hair, wearing dark shorts, green sweatshirt?
Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to recall seeing a male Caucasian mid 30s, wearing a gray-striped hoodie with shorts?
- No.
- Okay, thank you.
Could you tell me where the outpatient surgery is?
Yeah, if you just keep going straight down the hall you'll run right into it.
Woman:
Can I help you, sir?
Yeah, I couldn't help but notice there are no patients on this level.
Yeah, everyone's been moved to another facility.
They are shutting this entire hospital down Saturday for renovation.
You mean no one has been in any of these rooms today?
No.
Are you looking for someone?
I'm fine, thanks.
You wouldn't happen to know of a nurse named Amanda, would you?
Amanda?
No.
- No, no one.
- Are you sure?
I'm the head nurse.
I would know.
- Thanks.
- Have a good day.
Franklin:
Excuse me, I'm looking for a patient by the name of Kevin Peterson...
Excuse me, I'm looking for a guy, mid 30s, 6' tall- Kevin Peterson.
He's wearing a striped hoodie.
You wouldn't happen to recall seeing a male Caucasian, mid 30s, wearing a gray-striped hoodie with shorts?
- Woman:
No.
- Kevin Peterson checked in, mid 30s.
I'm looking for a patient by the name of Kevin Peterson...
By the name of Kevin Peterson...
Kevin Peterson, checked in today.
- Gray-striped hoodie with shorts...
- Woman:
No.
Woman:
Look, I just clock in and I clock out.
You do not recall hearing the name Kevin Peterson today?
Is that right?
Woman:
No.
Mary:
Chris, I'm in the security room at the hospital.
I took Kevin in and he's missing.
Look, slow down, okay?
You're scaring me.
What's going on?
Nobody just disappears.
No, he is missing.
I haven't seen him since the surgery.
I feel like I'm going crazy.
What are you talking about?
Saw him in pre-op.
Boom, went back to the room, gone.
He's not even in the computer system.
He's missing.
Okay, sweetie, you know, you just met Kevin.
Maybe...
He didn't leave me, honey.
Oh my God, sweetheart.
I'm not saying that he left you.
I know we've only been together for four months, but I have been waiting for him my whole entire life.
And I'm not gonna let someone take him away from me.
Okay, do you want me to come there?
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to call the police?
You're scaring me.
No, I already called the police.
That's why the detective's here.
I think I hear somebody coming.
Everybody's acting really strange.
There's something real off here.
I think they're all crazy.
Or I'm the crazy one.
So please, please, just keep checking in.
If I don't answer, come find me, okay?
I'm having the hardest time writing on this.
Oh, here, lean on this.
Ahh.
Thank you.
- So what's going on?
- What's going on?
Well, Miss Walsh,
Detective Franklin is out looking for your boyfriend.
It's been over an hour.
It's a big hospital.
You know, I think I'm gonna look myself.
Listen, I can't have you doing that.
I can't have you walking around the hallway scaring other patients.
Do you understand?
- Hi.
- I've been to all seven floors and not a single person has seen him.
Okay, um...
Then please, I have to file a report.
I told you he needs to be missing for 24 hours.
24 hours is too long.
Anything can happen in 24 hours.
Please, file a report.
What does Kevin do for a living?
He's in insurance.
Well, at least he's covered.
Have you ever been to his office?
Meet any of his colleagues?
No, he's freelance.
He works from the house.
But I did, while you were gone, jot this down for you.
Wait, you just happened to remember it?
I'd appreciate it if you ran it.
I'll see what I can do.
In the meantime, is there anybody else I could talk to?
Anybody who knew he'd be here today?
- What about family?
- Ooh!
His mother.
She lives in Florida, but he was gonna put her number into my phone in case of an emergency.
I just totally forgot.
Thank you.
Okay.
Wait.
The number you have reached is not in service at this time.
- There is no new number.
- No luck.
He must have input a wrong digit.
He's always been bad electronically.
Shoot!
You need proof.
You need some sort of evidence that this is real, that he actually exists, don't you?
- Antidepressants.
- I, uh-
I have a prescription for that, so...
Holloway:
That kind of says it all, doesn't it?
Please hand that to me.
I'll be right back, Mr. Holloway.
Where are you going?
May I have my medication back, please?
Detective Franklin, we have people here she can talk to.
I'm sure Miss Markham could arrange something.
All right, I'll run the Social.
I'll be back.
You got it.
Come on.
- Wait wait.
- Just stay out of the way.
Come on.
Your brace.
Do you want your bag?
No, just leave it in the back.
That's fine.
Thank God.
Where is it?
Okay, wanna come upstairs now?
Shoot!
Holloway:
It's not under the seat.
Shoot!
Wanna come upstairs now?
- It's not here.
- What's not here?
His bag.
It has his computer in it, all of his information- everything.
Somebody had to have gotten into the car.
What makes you think that?
Because the bag was here this morning.
Now it's not.
- It was right there.
- Miss Walsh, we need to speak with you.
Now.
I have the only set of keys.
Now.
We're in the middle of a huge transition.
I've got patients to move, equipment to transport.
Every minute that I or my security team spends chasing phantoms on surveillance cameras or finding you trespassing in a restricted area is one less minute we're able to do our jobs.
Every minute you don't spending looking for Kevin is a minute wasted.
Mary, I checked seven floors of this building.
I checked with every nurse's station.
I checked the emergency room.
I checked the intensive care ward.
What about the wing that's being renovated?
Franklin:
Yes.
- And?
- And no one reported seeing your boyfriend.
No one can even confirm that he was in this hospital.
Just what do you suppose happened to him?
- I don't know.
- Holloway:
Look, there are 23 exits in this facility.
Six are manned by my men.
Eight are alarmed and the rest are carefully monitored by cameras.
If anyone left this building under any manner of duress we would know about it.
Well, obviously, you're not looking hard enough.
- Detective...
- Detective Franklin.
- Detective, who is it?
- Really?
Okay, thank you.
What did they say?
We ran the Social Security number you gave me.
Good, okay, what's the next step?
It belongs to a 50-year-old African-American woman.
Well, that's obviously a mistake.
Not ours.
I ran the number you gave us.
No, that's impossible.
Okay, run them again, please?
Dr. Bensley, thank you for joining us.
I'd like to introduce you to someone.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello.
Markham:
Dr. Bensley is our hospital psychiatrist.
I don't need a psychiatrist.
Did you get the prescription I sent over?
I did.
Quite a potent dosage, Mary.
Would you mind coming with me for a moment?
Yes, actually, I would.
It doesn't need to be voluntary, Miss Walsh.
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
Right this way, please.
This way.
- Okay.
- Come on.
So you've been treated for psychiatric issues before, hmm, Mary?
Answer the question, Miss Walsh.
I...
I checked myself in when I was 22.
I was in grad school.
I was under a lot of stress.
I was there for three days.
That's it.
I don't see how that's relevant.
What are you doing on antidepressants?
Oh, you think I'm making this up.
You think that, what, my imaginary boyfriend went missing?
You're an only child.
Your father left when you were young.
Your mother died earlier this year in a hospital.
Yes, February.
She went in for a routine check-up and never checked out.
She had a blood infection.
So it's not surprising that your subconscious would choose a hospital to fabricate-
It's not my subconscious anything.
Oh my Lord!
This is real.
He was there for me.
You know, I remember her funeral.
- He was at it.
- Kevin?
Yes, Kevin.
I know it's hard to lose somebody you care deeply about, Mary.
It's very understandable how someone in your situation could suffer a psychological break.
You work long hours.
You've lost your emotional support system.
You're alone.
It's only natural for the brain to reach for something, anything, to grab onto.
He drove us here.
He did.
And I remember the ride like the back of my hand.
He- he- he was-
He was chewing on the lid of his coffee cup.
- It's this little nervous habit that he has.
- Sorry.
I know that it all must seem real.
It seems real because it is real!
I remember walking through the parking structure.
Memory is a very vivid and powerful sensation, Mary.
It is real!
This whole situation is real.
And he's here.
He was here,
He's somewhere right now in this hospital and we're wasting time!
The nurse advised me to get coffee, said the surgery would be an hour.
It was 25 minutes, and he's gone.
It was real.
It's all right, Mary.
Can I just have a moment alone?
Take all the time you need, dear.
I'll be in my office next door.
Okay.
Mary, I-
Security.
Want some company?
Do you know I was just here for a checkup today?
Doctor told me I need to take it easy.
Then you call.
I gotta tell you, this job can really take its toll on you- your health, your marriage.
You're married?
Was.
Marriage, it can be a funny thing, you know?
You commit yourself, you hand your heart over to someone, but it always seems like it's the little things that keep chipping away at it-
Little disagreements.
She- she hated the fact that I was a cop.
And you know what?
Maybe- maybe she was right.
I don't know.
I was working a gang shooting over in Glassell Park, and my partner and I, we traced the shooter back to his girlfriend's house.
He'd been shacking up there for a couple of weeks.
And we had the kid cornered, so we went in.
He was unarmed, gave himself right up.
What we didn't know that his girlfriend was in the house.
The last thing I remember before I blacked out... was watching my partner... his dark lifeless eyes as he fell to the floor.
Now look at me.
I've got a desk job and high blood pressure and a doctor telling me how to live my life.
What I'm- what I'm trying to say here is that...
I understand what you're going through.
Can you please tell Dr. Bensley that... he can just do whatever needs to do, all right?
Mary's behavior is definitely indicative of someone in the midst of an emotional breakdown.
And yet I never met anyone with such conviction in her delusion.
She absolutely believes that everything that's happening is real.
She's emotionally lost.
Yeah, this Bensley.
Listen, I wanna put Mary Walsh under 72-hour observation.
Mm-hmm.
Possible mental illness.
Mr. Holloway, this is J.J.
I have her in the hallway.
Switching to camera 2.
I'm following her along the hallway.
I have her.
- Do not lose her.
Sir, it looks like she's heading towards sublevel "B"- boiler room and laundry.
We only have limited coverage down there.
I'm en route right now.
Dr. Bensley, what are we dealing with here?
Is she dangerous?
It's impossible to say.
Acute perception of persecution, paranoia.
You just never know how someone like this will act when pushed too far.
No, no.
No cameras, none.
No parking lot.
No exits.
No.
I can't find her anywhere.
We only got a couple of cameras operational in that area, so it's not gonna be easy.
I'm gonna keep on scanning.
Wait, I think I've got something.
Boom!
Camera 4 in the boiler room.
She's wearing blue scrubs.
It looks like she's heading towards the morgue.
She's running.
She's on the move.
I'm gonna lose her.
You had a chance to talk with her.
Is she currently on meds?
Yeah, quite a potent dosage.
Okay, so this could be some sort of psychotic reaction.
It could indeed.
Hello.
Kevin:
Hello, it's me.
My God, Kevin.
Where are you?
I don't know.
Somewhere in the hospital.
What's happening?
Listen to me, okay?
Don't trust anyone.
I don't know how many people are involved in this.
It's very important, okay?
- What do they want?
- I don't know.
She has to be close by.
She couldn't have gone too far.
Check all the rooms on that wing.
Look around you.
Where are you?
Where are you right now?
I'm in a bathroom somewhere.
Are you okay?
Are you safe?
Where are you?
I don't- hold on.
Um...
I'm in the morgue.
- Can you get down here?
- No, no!
Leave me alone!
Kevin.
Kevin.
Kevin!
Kevin.
Miss Walsh.
Miss Walsh, you in here?
I got her.
She's heading towards the parking garage.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
This is a first date.
- We don't kiss on the first date.
- Third.
Fifth date.
Gonna wait?
This could take awhile.
I think I've done all I can do.
Sorry she sent you on such a wild goose chase.
Yeah, it happens.
- Good afternoon, Doc.
- Detective.
Cooper:
Hi, Mary.
- Hello.
- Shh.
I heard what happened.
These are for you.
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
The doctor thought you needed some more time to recuperate.
The cop
- I think he might have left.
Thank you.
They think I'm crazy.
I'm not.
I'm not crazy.
No, you're not crazy.
That's why I came down here.
I want to discuss the situation about Kevin and how you could see him again.
You do wanna see him again, right?
Do you know where he is?
Now don't get yourself worked up, young lady.
You did make quite a spectacle of yourself, Miss Walsh.
The emotional outburst, the panicking.
We expected that, but the accident.
Oh, my my, Mary, I mean, you've got to be more careful.
"Mary Catherine Walsh, unmarried, regional operations manager for the Empyrean International Bank. "
You rent a condo in Reseda.
Your mother died four months ago, but the bank got your house in the reverse mortgage.
That's true.
- How do you know this?
- I did my research.
But your bank, on the other hand, recently received from the federal government a $2 billion bailout.
Now I've seen the bonus structure, rewarding their executives while letting their customers go bankrupt, huh?
And you have access to unlimited funds.
Don't you hurt him.
Don't you hurt him!
So...
- How much?
- $10 million.
I've taken the liberty to get Kevin's computer.
Inside here you'll find the account and wire routing numbers of a bank account in the Cayman Islands.
Once I receive confirmation of funds received,
I'll let your boyfriend go.
Shit.
I have no Wi-Fi signal.
I checked it myself.
It's fine.
Yeah, I don't have a wireless signal in this room.
I need a hard line.
I need to move to a different location.
Yeah, it's me.
Yeah, cut off Peterson's finger.
No, wait!
Wait!
Tell him no.
Look at this right here.
This is our signal.
There is none.
I've tried every single network,
- and there's nothing.
- Hold that for one second.
I need you to move me to a place where I can plug in a different computer.
I can get it done in no time, okay?
Yeah, all right.
I've got 26 minutes till the cutoff, which is exactly how much time you've got to find a computer to get me my money.
You're being watched.
We know everything you do.
If you fail, Kevin dies.
If you tell anyone, Kevin dies.
If you leave the hospital, Kevin dies.
Got it.
Here's your clothing.
I found it downstairs.
Meet me on sublevel "B" when you're done.
Wonderful.
Miss Walsh?
Mr. Holloway, that crazy Mary Walsh lady is back wandering the halls.
She's looking for a patient that does not appear to be in our system.
She needs be escorted out immediately.
- I'll alert Miss Markham.
- Thank you.
We have footage of Miss Walsh in the trauma recovery room.
J.J., punch up everything on level 3, would you, please?
- Thank you.
- You got it.
- Holloway:
There you go.
- I wanted somebody on that door.
Unfortunately, the nurse stepped away.
You don't really think she's dangerous, do you?
I'm not taking any chances.
Besides, with her injuries, her well-being is my responsibility.
Trust me.
She's still here, and we will find her.
I have my people turning this place upside down.
Well, let me know the minute you hear anything.
I'm going back upstairs.
You got it, Miss Markham.
Thank you.
$10 million.
$10 million.
Please work.
Hello.
Mary:
Kevin.
- Mary, Mary.
- Oh, Kevin.
Are you hurt?
He's fine.
Let him go.
- The receipt.
- I need to email a confirmation code to complete the wire transfer.
So I would suggest that you let him go now.
Move it!
Honey.
I thought I lost you forever.
The code, come on!
Done.
Come on, let's go up those stairs.
We could get away.
Just go right up those stairs.
Well, I'm glad you made it safely.
I understand you're from Missouri.
Is that correct?
Yeah, Kansas City.
- Is that near St. Louis?
- Other side of the state.
Excuse me one second.
Royal Cayman Bank Trust.
This is Barry.
Yeah, Conyers.
Yeah, it's me.
Did it go through?
Yes, sir.
As a matter of fact, it's pending right now.
We're on, guys.
Thank you, Miss Walsh.
Great work, baby.
I mean, fantastic.
Kevin:
It's a good thing too.
Just in time, 'cause this brace is really starting to make my leg really stiff.
Kevin, what are you doing?
Cooper:
Haven't you been paying any attention?
There is no Kevin Peterson.
Kevin.
Oh my God.
Where are you?
I don't know.
I'm in the hospital somewhere.
Can you get down here?
- No, no, leave me alone!
- Kevin.
There is no...
Kevin Peterson.
Kevin, Kevin!
Kevin.
Don't you hurt him.
Don't you hurt him.
Oh, my.
So how much?
Franklin:
What about the nurse, this Amanda?
- So you must be Kevin Peterson.
- Yeah.
- I'm Amanda.
- Markham:
We don't have anyone
- by that name.
- See you in an hour.
- Mary:
Lovely nurse came in to prep him.
- What was the nurse's name?
Mary:
Uh, no...
Amanda.
- My boyfriend is Kevin Peterson...
- Come here, come here.
...and we can't find him.
My wife, she has breast cancer.
Well, she's up in chemo.
That's him right there.
Color accuracy is difficult to determine with closed-circuit cameras.
You know, Detective Franklin, we have people here she can talk to.
I'm sure Miss Markham could arrange something, if need be.
Mary:
Everything is a lie?
Everything is a lie?
Every- every- everything everything is a lie.
- Don't take it personally, Mare.
- Mare bear.
- Don't touch me.
The man you fell in love with... he's not real.
I'm a real idiot.
Didn't he tell you about his time in prison?
That's where I met the guy.
Believe me, if I was any younger, I would have done this myself.
No no no, Coop.
You couldn't handle her.
She's a real tiger cat between the sheets.
Oh, I don't know, Coop.
I think you could have handled her.
Holloway:
All we had to do was sit back and watch you lose it.
It was simple.
Mare bear, for old times' sake.
- Come on in.
- Don't you dare touch me.
- Don't touch me.
- Allow me.
Boys, I think it's time to go.
All right, Holloway, you know the drill.
Amanda.
I'll send you a postcard.
I'm sorry.
Victoria Markham's office, please.
It's Detective Franklin.
Tell her it's urgent.
What do you mean she disappeared?
Where'd she go?
Look, I think she's telling us the truth about her boyfriend.
She's messed up in something.
I don't know what it is.
I think she's in some kind of trouble.
Just find her.
Just find her!
I'm on my way there right now.
Whoo!
$10 million feels good, doesn't it, babe?
Baby, gimme a kiss.
You know, I almost feel bad.
Amanda:
Oh, yeah, why is that?
Almost, but I can think of 10 million reasons why not.
Come on!
Up!
Get up those stairs.
Come on!
Don't fight me!
Yeah, you're a fighter, ain't you?
I believe Stevie once said you were an animal in bed.
Easy easy.
Shh!
Yeah.
Damn, you're fine.
I wanna show you something.
- All right.
- Yeah.
Maybe I shouldn't let you go just yet.
What are you reaching for down there?
- It's my phone.
- What about your phone?
The transfer.
You know they were talking about the transfer?
Yeah, what about it?
It's still pending.
Really?
You pulling another one of your tiger moves?
- Is that it?
- I could take that money and I could transfer it right into your account with just the click of a button.
What do you mean I could have the money?
I'll prove it to you.
I'll do it right here.
Look.
Slowly, do it slowly.
Let me see.
Oh!
Mary, where's my little lamb?
Mary!
Where you at?
Holloway:
Mary!
Mary.
We got 23 exits.
We checked 22.
Really?
You think I did a good job?
Yes, you in the naughty nurse's outfit was really something.
Thanks, baby.
I was so nervous.
Hey, look, don't get too excited.
- Give Holloway a call.
- All right.
Kevin:
Hello, Holloway.
Sounds like you're out of breath.
Mare bear... is that you?
I can hear you breathing.
And I know your breath.
Where's Holloway?
You didn't kill Holloway, did you?
I didn't know you had it in you.
Mary.
Mary, listen to me.
I'm coming for you, Mary.
I'm coming down there.
You just stay put, sweets.
We can sort this all out.
I'm coming for you.
Damn it!
Holloway screwed up.
She's not dead.
Just relax.
I'll get the money, okay?
We'll get the money!
I thought you said you knew this chick, Steve.
I do.
I told you, she's smart.
- Hello.
- Barry:
I'm afraid there's been a problem.
The wire's been reversed.
Cooper:
What are you talking about?
The bank recalled the money.
Can't do that.
- It's not my call, sir.
- That's not good enough.
Sir, there's nothing more that I can do, okay?
It's not on my end.
I did what you told me to do.
- I did what you asked me to do.
- I'll get them to rescind it.
Sir, do whatever you have to do, sir.
I'm sorry.
We gotta go back.
Get us back to the hospital.
I'll take care of it myself.
I'll put a bullet in her head right now.
Turn around here.
Son of a bitch!
There she is!
End of the road, baby.
All right, you take the wheel.
Meet us topside.
Woman:
All units, three armed suspects spotted in hospital parking garage driving silver sedan.
All units respond.
Shh shh shh.
Wait wait.
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.
- Where'd they go?
- They went that way.
- Chill out!
- You stay right here.
You hear me?
Right here!
I need backup at County Hospital now.
Mary honey, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Mare bear.
No!
No, don't hit her.
We need her information.
Honey, Mary.
He's sorry.
Mare.
Mary:
Please stop!
Cooper, put the gun down.
You're a smart girl, Walsh.
There's no good way out of this.
Don't be stupid.
I'm gonna put my gun down.
I'm gonna do it right here.
I'll go my way.
You go yours, okay?
Drop your weapon, Cooper.
Coop... you okay?
Kevin:
Whoa whoa whoa!
Where'd you get a gun, honey?
Put it away.
Stay where you are.
Whoa whoa whoa.
Baby, I'll put this away.
Take it easy.
This is a whole different side of you
I've never seen.
And how do you feel about that side?
I like it.
I like it a lot.
Me too.
Baby, this whole thing has gotten completely out of hand.
You were never supposed to get hurt.
Okay?
Look, we can work this out.
Okay, listen, forget these guys, okay?
Why don't you and I just take the money?
You can resend it.
We'll take it.
We can be anybody we wanna be.
We can go anywhere we wanna go.
Think about that.
No no no, it started off about money, but now, I mean, honey, everything's changed.
I would hate for you to see four months of wasted time and effort.
I would really hate it.
It would hurt me.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
So you and I, we could take the money together.
Right here.
And it could happen just with the push of a little button.
We can go anywhere we want to.
We can be anybody we want to.
Think about it.
Baby, that sounds pretty fantastic.
You... always told me I was priceless.
Baby, you are priceless... to me.
Just didn't know that I was a $10 million catch!
No!
Mary.
See now, I'm gonna have to break up with you.
For real!
Mare!
Mary.
Mary, don't move.
Stay right there!
Don't move.
I'm gonna come to you.
You're okay.
Stay right there.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
- Detective Franklin.
- Mm-hmm.
Before we go up there and see all those people,
I just wanted to ask, why did you believe me?
This.
You left it in the chapel.
What about this?
The last chapter.
Take a look.
The whole thing, it's right there.
Couldn't even come up with something original.
Why don't you keep this for evidence?
- You gonna be okay?
- Sure I am.
Gonna just keep on living one day at a time.
- How about you?
- I called my wife.
- You did?
- You got me thinking.
Maybe I let her go too easily.
I am proud of you, kid.
Come on.
Let's get you to a real hospital.
- Okay?
- Then the games can really begin.
Sorry.
It's going to be okay.
Just don't think about it.
Yeah.
I just hate hospitals.
- Dang it.
- What?
I left my book at the house.
You know, in case we have to wait.
Shoot!
Um...
I'll look in my purse.
You rock.
You left it on the table.
Thank you.
Promise me you're not gonna leave, all right?
You're not gonna take off when they put me under.
I promise.
I would never leave.
Woman:
Isn't that always the way it works?
Man:
You'd think you see somebody with a crutch, they're gonna help 'em out.
Right, naturally.
Don't even hold the door.
All right, you stay there, please.
Give me one moment.
I can at least get out.
Let me just get the crutch.
Wait, wait.
- I can just stand.
- Come on.
The brace.
You're awesome.
- I love you.
Be careful.
- Love you.
Thank you.
- I'll be right up.
- All right.
Woman #2:
What's this I hear about you taking the morning off?
Woman:
Kevin has orthopedic surgery today.
Aww!
You're such a good girlfriend.
I told you about it.
He's always there for me.
He's amazing.
I think the bank could go one day without me.
You don't mind covering, right?
Of course.
Of course.
So when do I get to meet him?
- I don't know.
- It's been fours months.
- I'm back.
I wanna meet him.
- I know.
I just have never been in a relationship before where it's actually going well.
- How can I help you?
- Hi, where's outpatient surgery?
- Squeezed you in under the wire, huh?
- What do you mean?
We're shutting down for renovations on Saturday.
Most of our patients have already been moved to County West.
- Oh.
- Go through those doors and take the elevator up.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
Tell him we'll give him an extra basis point.
If he's worried about the rates and us not being competitive, tell him to just look at our rates.
Listen, Craig's been on this case.
Just have him deal with it.
If you have any questions, call Craig.
Okay, bye.
Hi.
Hey, baby.
Any trouble parking?
No, but I did finally speak with Christine, who wants us all to grab a pizza this weekend.
Her words.
All of us.
- The best friend that I never get to meet?
- Yes.
That's a biggie.
"Heart disease?" No.
"Rheumatic fever?" No.
- "Snoring?"
- Sometimes.
- Really?
- Yeah.
So you're sure you're okay with this whole introduction thing to your friends?
That's a big step.
No.
Every time I introduce her to anybody, it's sort of bad luck.
Well, don't you worry.
Because you are not gonna lose me.
Ever.
"Social Security number"?
I've been having the hardest time writing on this.
Oh, here, lean on this.
Ahh.
Thank you.
So you must be Kevin Peterson.
- I am.
- I'm Amanda.
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Mary.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Dr. Harding will be in in a moment so I just wanna check some things out.
Okay.
- It's all done.
- Thank you.
Does your wife mind waiting outside?
Oh, well, we're not married.
I don't mind.
Do you have a place I could grab a coffee?
We have a cafeteria attached to the lobby downstairs.
Perfect.
Thank you.
You gonna be okay?
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.
Don't leave me though, right?
- Promise?
- I promise.
Cross my heart, promise.
Okay.
You take care of him.
Oh, how long will it be?
- About an hour.
- An hour?
Really?
- Yep.
- Well, good luck.
Thank you.
See you in an hour.
Just tell him that he has to sign the request form in person.
Yeah, he has to come in.
He already knows that.
Just do it.
I'll tell him if I have to.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Let him know I'll call him back this afternoon.
I'll call you back, bye.
- Let me please.
- Thank you.
Sorry.
There's a garbage...
- Yeah.
- Right there and another one.
Oh, thanks a lot.
- I'm Cooper, by the way.
- Cooper, I'm Mary.
- Mary.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- You want some company?
- Sure.
Well, okay.
So what are you-
- What am I in for?
- I wasn't going to say it quite like that, but yes.
My wife, she has breast cancer, and well, she's up in chemo.
How's it going?
I'm sorry.
Small improvement.
We're keeping our fingers crossed.
- So we'll see what happens.
- I'm sorry.
What about you?
You're not here for the coffee, right?
I'm just here for the day.
My boyfriend's having orthopedic surgery.
He tore his A.C.L.
hiking and flared up an old football injury.
He hurt himself, huh?
Yep.
Keep telling him to take it easy.
You don't like hospitals, do you?
Does anybody like hospitals?
Except for the doctors and nurses?
I've been doing this every week for six months.
And I can't wait till they shut this place down.
- Believe you me.
- Sorry.
Wow, look at you go.
It's my job.
MIT said that 90% of people who use smartphones feel more stress.
Only 90%?
I mean, look at you.
You're sitting in a hospital waiting for your boyfriend, and you're working.
What happened to the days where you could say,
"I'm out of the office," you know?
Well, sir, to the good old days.
- Cheers, Mary.
- Cheers.
Kevin.
Man over P.A.:
Monica Hernandez, your party is ready in post-op.
Jeanette Stevens, Mary Turner, your parties are ready.
- May I help you?
- Yes, please.
Hi.
My boyfriend was having surgery, and I just want to see how much longer it's going to be.
Certainly.
What was his name?
Peterson
- Kevin Peterson.
You're sure?
How are you spelling it?
P-e-t-e-r...
- s-o-n.
Peterson.
- Peterson with an "O."
I'm not showing anyone in our system with that name.
Okay, well, he's definitely having surgery.
- Do you happen to-
- Orthopedics.
Do you happen to remember the room number?
Yeah, it was right down the hall, actually.
This floor.
- What about the doctor's name?
- Room 714.
Harding.
Dr. Harding.
Dr. Harding's off today.
I'm sorry.
There's no one in our system with the name Kevin Peterson.
Well...
Are you sure it could have been in this hospital?
Perhaps it was in another hospital.
We've stopped doing outpatient procedures at this time.
Okay, I was here.
We drove together.
During pre-op, I was in the room with him.
- Lovely nurse came in to prep him.
- What was the nurse's name?
No, what was her name?
Amanda.
Amanda.
- Do you know her?
- Doesn't ring a bell.
Okay.
Maybe orthopedics she's in.
Are you sure that he just didn't leave without you?
I have the keys.
I have the keys to the car.
Okay?
I just wanna know where my boyfriend is.
Can you please help me find him?
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
He's not in our systems.
This is ridiculous.
Would you like me to page him for you?
Thank you.
That would be great.
Kevin Peterson, can you please dial 9 and come to the courtesy phone?
Kevin Peterson, please dial 9.
Kevin Peterson, please dial 9 at the courtesy phone.
Hey, this is Kevin.
Do your business after the beep.
Sweetheart.
Ma'am, you cannot use your cell phone.
- I'll be two seconds.
- You cannot use your cell phone.
I have this nurse that's driving me absolutely crazy.
I'm at the nurses' station on the floor that had a room- 714 was on the last place I saw you.
Right now it is- it's definitely been over an hour.
I can tell you that much.
It's been hours, and I've looked everywhere.
I can't find you.
The second you get this message, okay, you call me.
Okay, baby.
You call me, okay?
Love you.
I love you.
Hi, we met this morning.
You told me where to check in for outpatient surgery.
Kevin Peterson is a patient here.
- His doctor is Dr. Harding.
- Okay.
He is my boyfriend.
I can't find him anywhere.
- Do you remember me from earlier?
- I remember you.
- You were by yourself.
- I was.
I dropped him off in the parking structure, okay.
I don't make mix-ups, and my computer is giving me the correct information.
And there is no Kevin Peterson.
Perhaps it's new information, or something's changed.
I'm looking at my computer printout and I don't see a Kevin Peterson.
I heard you.
Okay.
Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Yes, can I help you?
Yes, please.
I'm looking for someone who's missing.
- Missing
- He's 35, 6'1", dark hair, dark eyes.
I haven't seen anybody by that description.
I'm sorry.
He's wearing a brace on his left leg.
Are you okay?
Ma'am, are you okay?
Excuse me.
Yeah, this is Holloway in the lobby.
Yeah, I've got a young woman who's looking for an unidentified male.
Hi, I'm looking for a patient that's in recovery named Kevin Peterson.
Never heard of him.
Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hi, excuse me.
Can I help you?
Hi, yes, I am looking for Kevin Peterson,
Dr. Harding's patient.
Great, I understand.
This is a restricted area.
- I think he's just back there.
- I understand, ma'am, but I need you to leave the restricted area.
He is an outpatient.
He's recovering.
This is recovery.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
I'm very busy right now.
I'm very sorry.
Okay.
- Hi.
- I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm with a patient.
Look, ma'am, I really need you to get out of this area.
Security, can you take her away, please?
Ma'am, this is a restricted area.
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
This is a restricted area.
You have to leave.
Can you please escort me to Dr. Harding instead?
Yes.
You have to get out of here.
It's a restricted area.
This is her.
And this is Miss Markham, our hospital administrator.
- Thank you.
Hi, thank God.
- How can I help you?
I'm Mary Walsh.
My boyfriend had surgery here this morning.
- He's missing.
- Missing?
- Yes.
- I told her there was no one who's checked into this hospital by the name of Kevin Peterson.
Okay, well, he had orthopedic surgery-
A.C.L.- this morning.
His doctor is Dr. Harding.
Evidently, neither one of them are in your system.
And no one's in his room.
Okay, well, obviously there's been some kind of mistake.
That's what I've been trying to explain to you.
Come with me, please.
Let me see what we can do.
What time this morning was it that you and your boyfriend arrived?
About 7:15.
Surgery started at 8:00.
Okay, and you're the one
- who arrived here with him.
- Correct.
Okay.
Oh...
Rewind that a hair.
Wait, stop.
All right, these numbers don't-
These times don't coincide.
Keep fast-forwarding, please.
We weren't even out of bed yet.
Okay, keep going.
Okay, right here.
We were already here.
Back it up, please.
Okay, now... rewind it just a hair.
Wait, wait.
Wait, did you see that?
Turn it back.
Go back a bit.
Play it from this point.
Good.
Keep playing, please.
Pause!
That's him.
Right there.
That's him.
He's wearing the green and gray striped shirt.
Color accuracy is difficult to determine on closed-circuit cameras.
You've gotta be kidding me.
That's him.
He's right there.
Markham:
Miss Walsh.
Mary:
I'm looking at him, you know?
He may not be in your computer, but he's right on your security camera.
Do you have a copy of his hospital appointment record?
No, it was on him.
Oh God.
It might be in his computer bag in the car.
I will have my team look for him,
- but you know I'm understaffed.
- Yeah.
Where do you think you're going?
I'm gonna go call somebody who can actually help me out here.
I just didn't think there was anything conclusive on that.
Do what you can, but...
- You got it, Miss Markham.
- Thank you.
Yeah, come in.
Man:
Breathe in out, in... out.
- How is it, Doc?
- It's 160 over 100.
You still taking the medication?
Every day.
- What about work?
- What about it?
I don't know, Rich.
Something like this takes time.
You don't wanna rush it.
Heaven forbid.
- I'm gonna increase the dosage though.
- Okay, thanks.
But I really need you to take it easy, man.
Whatever you say, Doc.
All right.
See you on Thursday?
- Wouldn't miss it.
- All right, take care.
- Franklin here.
- Woman:
This is dispatch.
We've got reports of a missing person at County Memorial.
- Are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm still here.
What floor?
Mary:
When I arrived, he wasn't in his room.
So I went down to the waiting room and waited there for a good couple of hours.
Started getting increasingly concerned and went back to his floor and spoke with the head nurse and learned for the first time that he was not in the computer system.
We have looked.
No one by the name of Kevin Peterson was scheduled for anything today, not even a check-up.
What about the nurse, this Amanda?
We don't have anyone on staff by that name,
- and the doctor that he was supposedly-
- Dr. Harding.
scheduled with is on vacation.
Look, if you could just access Kevin's insurance records.
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.
Why?
The insurance company will only release information to the policyholder's spouse.
Okay, but this is an emergency situation.
He's missing.
I'm sorry.
The hospital can't release any information to a non-family member without a court order.
Detective...
I'm getting really really worried that something bad's happened to him.
Can you please help me?
Okay, first of all,
I can't file a report for 24 hours.
24 hours?
I'll be honest with you, Miss Walsh, most of the time we get a call saying a spouse or boyfriend or whatever is missing, usually they just up and left.
Have you considered the possibility that your boyfriend might have walked out on you?
I could see how you two would think that, but that's just not him, no.
- How long have you been together?
- Four months.
Markham:
That's not a lot of time to get to know someone.
Maybe your relationship isn't what you thought it was.
No, I trust him.
Detective Franklin:
Do you have a picture?
Maybe, wait.
I think.
Hold on, I think I do.
Yeah, right here.
Can you make anything out?
Markham:
No.
Well, it's not the best picture.
It's something.
How about a description?
He's 6'0", maybe 6'1".
Around 190.
Brown hair.
Brown eyes.
He was wearing a green and gray shirt today and shorts because he has on a huge leg brace.
And he was using a crutch.
Shirt was long-sleeved.
Security has their people searching the entire hospital and no one has seen anyone matching that description.
I'll see what I can find.
In the meantime, I need you to sit right here.
I feel very awkward just not doing anything and staying here.
Miss Walsh, the more cooperation I can get from you, the faster this can go for everyone.
All right?
Okay?
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
If you hear anything, give me a call.
- Anything I can do to help.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.
Will you excuse me for a minute?
Yes, of course.
Have you seen a male Caucasian, mid 30s, dark hair, wearing dark shorts, green sweatshirt?
Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to recall seeing a male Caucasian mid 30s, wearing a gray-striped hoodie with shorts?
- No.
- Okay, thank you.
Could you tell me where the outpatient surgery is?
Yeah, if you just keep going straight down the hall you'll run right into it.
Woman:
Can I help you, sir?
Yeah, I couldn't help but notice there are no patients on this level.
Yeah, everyone's been moved to another facility.
They are shutting this entire hospital down Saturday for renovation.
You mean no one has been in any of these rooms today?
No.
Are you looking for someone?
I'm fine, thanks.
You wouldn't happen to know of a nurse named Amanda, would you?
Amanda?
No.
- No, no one.
- Are you sure?
I'm the head nurse.
I would know.
- Thanks.
- Have a good day.
Franklin:
Excuse me, I'm looking for a patient by the name of Kevin Peterson...
Excuse me, I'm looking for a guy, mid 30s, 6' tall- Kevin Peterson.
He's wearing a striped hoodie.
You wouldn't happen to recall seeing a male Caucasian, mid 30s, wearing a gray-striped hoodie with shorts?
- Woman:
No.
- Kevin Peterson checked in, mid 30s.
I'm looking for a patient by the name of Kevin Peterson...
By the name of Kevin Peterson...
Kevin Peterson, checked in today.
- Gray-striped hoodie with shorts...
- Woman:
No.
Woman:
Look, I just clock in and I clock out.
You do not recall hearing the name Kevin Peterson today?
Is that right?
Woman:
No.
Mary:
Chris, I'm in the security room at the hospital.
I took Kevin in and he's missing.
Look, slow down, okay?
You're scaring me.
What's going on?
Nobody just disappears.
No, he is missing.
I haven't seen him since the surgery.
I feel like I'm going crazy.
What are you talking about?
Saw him in pre-op.
Boom, went back to the room, gone.
He's not even in the computer system.
He's missing.
Okay, sweetie, you know, you just met Kevin.
Maybe...
He didn't leave me, honey.
Oh my God, sweetheart.
I'm not saying that he left you.
I know we've only been together for four months, but I have been waiting for him my whole entire life.
And I'm not gonna let someone take him away from me.
Okay, do you want me to come there?
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to call the police?
You're scaring me.
No, I already called the police.
That's why the detective's here.
I think I hear somebody coming.
Everybody's acting really strange.
There's something real off here.
I think they're all crazy.
Or I'm the crazy one.
So please, please, just keep checking in.
If I don't answer, come find me, okay?
I'm having the hardest time writing on this.
Oh, here, lean on this.
Ahh.
Thank you.
- So what's going on?
- What's going on?
Well, Miss Walsh,
Detective Franklin is out looking for your boyfriend.
It's been over an hour.
It's a big hospital.
You know, I think I'm gonna look myself.
Listen, I can't have you doing that.
I can't have you walking around the hallway scaring other patients.
Do you understand?
- Hi.
- I've been to all seven floors and not a single person has seen him.
Okay, um...
Then please, I have to file a report.
I told you he needs to be missing for 24 hours.
24 hours is too long.
Anything can happen in 24 hours.
Please, file a report.
What does Kevin do for a living?
He's in insurance.
Well, at least he's covered.
Have you ever been to his office?
Meet any of his colleagues?
No, he's freelance.
He works from the house.
But I did, while you were gone, jot this down for you.
Wait, you just happened to remember it?
I'd appreciate it if you ran it.
I'll see what I can do.
In the meantime, is there anybody else I could talk to?
Anybody who knew he'd be here today?
- What about family?
- Ooh!
His mother.
She lives in Florida, but he was gonna put her number into my phone in case of an emergency.
I just totally forgot.
Thank you.
Okay.
Wait.
The number you have reached is not in service at this time.
- There is no new number.
- No luck.
He must have input a wrong digit.
He's always been bad electronically.
Shoot!
You need proof.
You need some sort of evidence that this is real, that he actually exists, don't you?
- Antidepressants.
- I, uh-
I have a prescription for that, so...
Holloway:
That kind of says it all, doesn't it?
Please hand that to me.
I'll be right back, Mr. Holloway.
Where are you going?
May I have my medication back, please?
Detective Franklin, we have people here she can talk to.
I'm sure Miss Markham could arrange something.
All right, I'll run the Social.
I'll be back.
You got it.
Come on.
- Wait wait.
- Just stay out of the way.
Come on.
Your brace.
Do you want your bag?
No, just leave it in the back.
That's fine.
Thank God.
Where is it?
Okay, wanna come upstairs now?
Shoot!
Holloway:
It's not under the seat.
Shoot!
Wanna come upstairs now?
- It's not here.
- What's not here?
His bag.
It has his computer in it, all of his information- everything.
Somebody had to have gotten into the car.
What makes you think that?
Because the bag was here this morning.
Now it's not.
- It was right there.
- Miss Walsh, we need to speak with you.
Now.
I have the only set of keys.
Now.
We're in the middle of a huge transition.
I've got patients to move, equipment to transport.
Every minute that I or my security team spends chasing phantoms on surveillance cameras or finding you trespassing in a restricted area is one less minute we're able to do our jobs.
Every minute you don't spending looking for Kevin is a minute wasted.
Mary, I checked seven floors of this building.
I checked with every nurse's station.
I checked the emergency room.
I checked the intensive care ward.
What about the wing that's being renovated?
Franklin:
Yes.
- And?
- And no one reported seeing your boyfriend.
No one can even confirm that he was in this hospital.
Just what do you suppose happened to him?
- I don't know.
- Holloway:
Look, there are 23 exits in this facility.
Six are manned by my men.
Eight are alarmed and the rest are carefully monitored by cameras.
If anyone left this building under any manner of duress we would know about it.
Well, obviously, you're not looking hard enough.
- Detective...
- Detective Franklin.
- Detective, who is it?
- Really?
Okay, thank you.
What did they say?
We ran the Social Security number you gave me.
Good, okay, what's the next step?
It belongs to a 50-year-old African-American woman.
Well, that's obviously a mistake.
Not ours.
I ran the number you gave us.
No, that's impossible.
Okay, run them again, please?
Dr. Bensley, thank you for joining us.
I'd like to introduce you to someone.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello.
Markham:
Dr. Bensley is our hospital psychiatrist.
I don't need a psychiatrist.
Did you get the prescription I sent over?
I did.
Quite a potent dosage, Mary.
Would you mind coming with me for a moment?
Yes, actually, I would.
It doesn't need to be voluntary, Miss Walsh.
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
Right this way, please.
This way.
- Okay.
- Come on.
So you've been treated for psychiatric issues before, hmm, Mary?
Answer the question, Miss Walsh.
I...
I checked myself in when I was 22.
I was in grad school.
I was under a lot of stress.
I was there for three days.
That's it.
I don't see how that's relevant.
What are you doing on antidepressants?
Oh, you think I'm making this up.
You think that, what, my imaginary boyfriend went missing?
You're an only child.
Your father left when you were young.
Your mother died earlier this year in a hospital.
Yes, February.
She went in for a routine check-up and never checked out.
She had a blood infection.
So it's not surprising that your subconscious would choose a hospital to fabricate-
It's not my subconscious anything.
Oh my Lord!
This is real.
He was there for me.
You know, I remember her funeral.
- He was at it.
- Kevin?
Yes, Kevin.
I know it's hard to lose somebody you care deeply about, Mary.
It's very understandable how someone in your situation could suffer a psychological break.
You work long hours.
You've lost your emotional support system.
You're alone.
It's only natural for the brain to reach for something, anything, to grab onto.
He drove us here.
He did.
And I remember the ride like the back of my hand.
He- he- he was-
He was chewing on the lid of his coffee cup.
- It's this little nervous habit that he has.
- Sorry.
I know that it all must seem real.
It seems real because it is real!
I remember walking through the parking structure.
Memory is a very vivid and powerful sensation, Mary.
It is real!
This whole situation is real.
And he's here.
He was here,
He's somewhere right now in this hospital and we're wasting time!
The nurse advised me to get coffee, said the surgery would be an hour.
It was 25 minutes, and he's gone.
It was real.
It's all right, Mary.
Can I just have a moment alone?
Take all the time you need, dear.
I'll be in my office next door.
Okay.
Mary, I-
Security.
Want some company?
Do you know I was just here for a checkup today?
Doctor told me I need to take it easy.
Then you call.
I gotta tell you, this job can really take its toll on you- your health, your marriage.
You're married?
Was.
Marriage, it can be a funny thing, you know?
You commit yourself, you hand your heart over to someone, but it always seems like it's the little things that keep chipping away at it-
Little disagreements.
She- she hated the fact that I was a cop.
And you know what?
Maybe- maybe she was right.
I don't know.
I was working a gang shooting over in Glassell Park, and my partner and I, we traced the shooter back to his girlfriend's house.
He'd been shacking up there for a couple of weeks.
And we had the kid cornered, so we went in.
He was unarmed, gave himself right up.
What we didn't know that his girlfriend was in the house.
The last thing I remember before I blacked out... was watching my partner... his dark lifeless eyes as he fell to the floor.
Now look at me.
I've got a desk job and high blood pressure and a doctor telling me how to live my life.
What I'm- what I'm trying to say here is that...
I understand what you're going through.
Can you please tell Dr. Bensley that... he can just do whatever needs to do, all right?
Mary's behavior is definitely indicative of someone in the midst of an emotional breakdown.
And yet I never met anyone with such conviction in her delusion.
She absolutely believes that everything that's happening is real.
She's emotionally lost.
Yeah, this Bensley.
Listen, I wanna put Mary Walsh under 72-hour observation.
Mm-hmm.
Possible mental illness.
Mr. Holloway, this is J.J.
I have her in the hallway.
Switching to camera 2.
I'm following her along the hallway.
I have her.
- Do not lose her.
Sir, it looks like she's heading towards sublevel "B"- boiler room and laundry.
We only have limited coverage down there.
I'm en route right now.
Dr. Bensley, what are we dealing with here?
Is she dangerous?
It's impossible to say.
Acute perception of persecution, paranoia.
You just never know how someone like this will act when pushed too far.
No, no.
No cameras, none.
No parking lot.
No exits.
No.
I can't find her anywhere.
We only got a couple of cameras operational in that area, so it's not gonna be easy.
I'm gonna keep on scanning.
Wait, I think I've got something.
Boom!
Camera 4 in the boiler room.
She's wearing blue scrubs.
It looks like she's heading towards the morgue.
She's running.
She's on the move.
I'm gonna lose her.
You had a chance to talk with her.
Is she currently on meds?
Yeah, quite a potent dosage.
Okay, so this could be some sort of psychotic reaction.
It could indeed.
Hello.
Kevin:
Hello, it's me.
My God, Kevin.
Where are you?
I don't know.
Somewhere in the hospital.
What's happening?
Listen to me, okay?
Don't trust anyone.
I don't know how many people are involved in this.
It's very important, okay?
- What do they want?
- I don't know.
She has to be close by.
She couldn't have gone too far.
Check all the rooms on that wing.
Look around you.
Where are you?
Where are you right now?
I'm in a bathroom somewhere.
Are you okay?
Are you safe?
Where are you?
I don't- hold on.
Um...
I'm in the morgue.
- Can you get down here?
- No, no!
Leave me alone!
Kevin.
Kevin.
Kevin!
Kevin.
Miss Walsh.
Miss Walsh, you in here?
I got her.
She's heading towards the parking garage.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
This is a first date.
- We don't kiss on the first date.
- Third.
Fifth date.
Gonna wait?
This could take awhile.
I think I've done all I can do.
Sorry she sent you on such a wild goose chase.
Yeah, it happens.
- Good afternoon, Doc.
- Detective.
Cooper:
Hi, Mary.
- Hello.
- Shh.
I heard what happened.
These are for you.
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
The doctor thought you needed some more time to recuperate.
The cop
- I think he might have left.
Thank you.
They think I'm crazy.
I'm not.
I'm not crazy.
No, you're not crazy.
That's why I came down here.
I want to discuss the situation about Kevin and how you could see him again.
You do wanna see him again, right?
Do you know where he is?
Now don't get yourself worked up, young lady.
You did make quite a spectacle of yourself, Miss Walsh.
The emotional outburst, the panicking.
We expected that, but the accident.
Oh, my my, Mary, I mean, you've got to be more careful.
"Mary Catherine Walsh, unmarried, regional operations manager for the Empyrean International Bank. "
You rent a condo in Reseda.
Your mother died four months ago, but the bank got your house in the reverse mortgage.
That's true.
- How do you know this?
- I did my research.
But your bank, on the other hand, recently received from the federal government a $2 billion bailout.
Now I've seen the bonus structure, rewarding their executives while letting their customers go bankrupt, huh?
And you have access to unlimited funds.
Don't you hurt him.
Don't you hurt him!
So...
- How much?
- $10 million.
I've taken the liberty to get Kevin's computer.
Inside here you'll find the account and wire routing numbers of a bank account in the Cayman Islands.
Once I receive confirmation of funds received,
I'll let your boyfriend go.
Shit.
I have no Wi-Fi signal.
I checked it myself.
It's fine.
Yeah, I don't have a wireless signal in this room.
I need a hard line.
I need to move to a different location.
Yeah, it's me.
Yeah, cut off Peterson's finger.
No, wait!
Wait!
Tell him no.
Look at this right here.
This is our signal.
There is none.
I've tried every single network,
- and there's nothing.
- Hold that for one second.
I need you to move me to a place where I can plug in a different computer.
I can get it done in no time, okay?
Yeah, all right.
I've got 26 minutes till the cutoff, which is exactly how much time you've got to find a computer to get me my money.
You're being watched.
We know everything you do.
If you fail, Kevin dies.
If you tell anyone, Kevin dies.
If you leave the hospital, Kevin dies.
Got it.
Here's your clothing.
I found it downstairs.
Meet me on sublevel "B" when you're done.
Wonderful.
Miss Walsh?
Mr. Holloway, that crazy Mary Walsh lady is back wandering the halls.
She's looking for a patient that does not appear to be in our system.
She needs be escorted out immediately.
- I'll alert Miss Markham.
- Thank you.
We have footage of Miss Walsh in the trauma recovery room.
J.J., punch up everything on level 3, would you, please?
- Thank you.
- You got it.
- Holloway:
There you go.
- I wanted somebody on that door.
Unfortunately, the nurse stepped away.
You don't really think she's dangerous, do you?
I'm not taking any chances.
Besides, with her injuries, her well-being is my responsibility.
Trust me.
She's still here, and we will find her.
I have my people turning this place upside down.
Well, let me know the minute you hear anything.
I'm going back upstairs.
You got it, Miss Markham.
Thank you.
$10 million.
$10 million.
Please work.
Hello.
Mary:
Kevin.
- Mary, Mary.
- Oh, Kevin.
Are you hurt?
He's fine.
Let him go.
- The receipt.
- I need to email a confirmation code to complete the wire transfer.
So I would suggest that you let him go now.
Move it!
Honey.
I thought I lost you forever.
The code, come on!
Done.
Come on, let's go up those stairs.
We could get away.
Just go right up those stairs.
Well, I'm glad you made it safely.
I understand you're from Missouri.
Is that correct?
Yeah, Kansas City.
- Is that near St. Louis?
- Other side of the state.
Excuse me one second.
Royal Cayman Bank Trust.
This is Barry.
Yeah, Conyers.
Yeah, it's me.
Did it go through?
Yes, sir.
As a matter of fact, it's pending right now.
We're on, guys.
Thank you, Miss Walsh.
Great work, baby.
I mean, fantastic.
Kevin:
It's a good thing too.
Just in time, 'cause this brace is really starting to make my leg really stiff.
Kevin, what are you doing?
Cooper:
Haven't you been paying any attention?
There is no Kevin Peterson.
Kevin.
Oh my God.
Where are you?
I don't know.
I'm in the hospital somewhere.
Can you get down here?
- No, no, leave me alone!
- Kevin.
There is no...
Kevin Peterson.
Kevin, Kevin!
Kevin.
Don't you hurt him.
Don't you hurt him.
Oh, my.
So how much?
Franklin:
What about the nurse, this Amanda?
- So you must be Kevin Peterson.
- Yeah.
- I'm Amanda.
- Markham:
We don't have anyone
- by that name.
- See you in an hour.
- Mary:
Lovely nurse came in to prep him.
- What was the nurse's name?
Mary:
Uh, no...
Amanda.
- My boyfriend is Kevin Peterson...
- Come here, come here.
...and we can't find him.
My wife, she has breast cancer.
Well, she's up in chemo.
That's him right there.
Color accuracy is difficult to determine with closed-circuit cameras.
You know, Detective Franklin, we have people here she can talk to.
I'm sure Miss Markham could arrange something, if need be.
Mary:
Everything is a lie?
Everything is a lie?
Every- every- everything everything is a lie.
- Don't take it personally, Mare.
- Mare bear.
- Don't touch me.
The man you fell in love with... he's not real.
I'm a real idiot.
Didn't he tell you about his time in prison?
That's where I met the guy.
Believe me, if I was any younger, I would have done this myself.
No no no, Coop.
You couldn't handle her.
She's a real tiger cat between the sheets.
Oh, I don't know, Coop.
I think you could have handled her.
Holloway:
All we had to do was sit back and watch you lose it.
It was simple.
Mare bear, for old times' sake.
- Come on in.
- Don't you dare touch me.
- Don't touch me.
- Allow me.
Boys, I think it's time to go.
All right, Holloway, you know the drill.
Amanda.
I'll send you a postcard.
I'm sorry.
Victoria Markham's office, please.
It's Detective Franklin.
Tell her it's urgent.
What do you mean she disappeared?
Where'd she go?
Look, I think she's telling us the truth about her boyfriend.
She's messed up in something.
I don't know what it is.
I think she's in some kind of trouble.
Just find her.
Just find her!
I'm on my way there right now.
Whoo!
$10 million feels good, doesn't it, babe?
Baby, gimme a kiss.
You know, I almost feel bad.
Amanda:
Oh, yeah, why is that?
Almost, but I can think of 10 million reasons why not.
Come on!
Up!
Get up those stairs.
Come on!
Don't fight me!
Yeah, you're a fighter, ain't you?
I believe Stevie once said you were an animal in bed.
Easy easy.
Shh!
Yeah.
Damn, you're fine.
I wanna show you something.
- All right.
- Yeah.
Maybe I shouldn't let you go just yet.
What are you reaching for down there?
- It's my phone.
- What about your phone?
The transfer.
You know they were talking about the transfer?
Yeah, what about it?
It's still pending.
Really?
You pulling another one of your tiger moves?
- Is that it?
- I could take that money and I could transfer it right into your account with just the click of a button.
What do you mean I could have the money?
I'll prove it to you.
I'll do it right here.
Look.
Slowly, do it slowly.
Let me see.
Oh!
Mary, where's my little lamb?
Mary!
Where you at?
Holloway:
Mary!
Mary.
We got 23 exits.
We checked 22.
Really?
You think I did a good job?
Yes, you in the naughty nurse's outfit was really something.
Thanks, baby.
I was so nervous.
Hey, look, don't get too excited.
- Give Holloway a call.
- All right.
Kevin:
Hello, Holloway.
Sounds like you're out of breath.
Mare bear... is that you?
I can hear you breathing.
And I know your breath.
Where's Holloway?
You didn't kill Holloway, did you?
I didn't know you had it in you.
Mary.
Mary, listen to me.
I'm coming for you, Mary.
I'm coming down there.
You just stay put, sweets.
We can sort this all out.
I'm coming for you.
Damn it!
Holloway screwed up.
She's not dead.
Just relax.
I'll get the money, okay?
We'll get the money!
I thought you said you knew this chick, Steve.
I do.
I told you, she's smart.
- Hello.
- Barry:
I'm afraid there's been a problem.
The wire's been reversed.
Cooper:
What are you talking about?
The bank recalled the money.
Can't do that.
- It's not my call, sir.
- That's not good enough.
Sir, there's nothing more that I can do, okay?
It's not on my end.
I did what you told me to do.
- I did what you asked me to do.
- I'll get them to rescind it.
Sir, do whatever you have to do, sir.
I'm sorry.
We gotta go back.
Get us back to the hospital.
I'll take care of it myself.
I'll put a bullet in her head right now.
Turn around here.
Son of a bitch!
There she is!
End of the road, baby.
All right, you take the wheel.
Meet us topside.
Woman:
All units, three armed suspects spotted in hospital parking garage driving silver sedan.
All units respond.
Shh shh shh.
Wait wait.
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.
- Where'd they go?
- They went that way.
- Chill out!
- You stay right here.
You hear me?
Right here!
I need backup at County Hospital now.
Mary honey, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Mare bear.
No!
No, don't hit her.
We need her information.
Honey, Mary.
He's sorry.
Mare.
Mary:
Please stop!
Cooper, put the gun down.
You're a smart girl, Walsh.
There's no good way out of this.
Don't be stupid.
I'm gonna put my gun down.
I'm gonna do it right here.
I'll go my way.
You go yours, okay?
Drop your weapon, Cooper.
Coop... you okay?
Kevin:
Whoa whoa whoa!
Where'd you get a gun, honey?
Put it away.
Stay where you are.
Whoa whoa whoa.
Baby, I'll put this away.
Take it easy.
This is a whole different side of you
I've never seen.
And how do you feel about that side?
I like it.
I like it a lot.
Me too.
Baby, this whole thing has gotten completely out of hand.
You were never supposed to get hurt.
Okay?
Look, we can work this out.
Okay, listen, forget these guys, okay?
Why don't you and I just take the money?
You can resend it.
We'll take it.
We can be anybody we wanna be.
We can go anywhere we wanna go.
Think about that.
No no no, it started off about money, but now, I mean, honey, everything's changed.
I would hate for you to see four months of wasted time and effort.
I would really hate it.
It would hurt me.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
So you and I, we could take the money together.
Right here.
And it could happen just with the push of a little button.
We can go anywhere we want to.
We can be anybody we want to.
Think about it.
Baby, that sounds pretty fantastic.
You... always told me I was priceless.
Baby, you are priceless... to me.
Just didn't know that I was a $10 million catch!
No!
Mary.
See now, I'm gonna have to break up with you.
For real!
Mare!
Mary.
Mary, don't move.
Stay right there!
Don't move.
I'm gonna come to you.
You're okay.
Stay right there.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
- Detective Franklin.
- Mm-hmm.
Before we go up there and see all those people,
I just wanted to ask, why did you believe me?
This.
You left it in the chapel.
What about this?
The last chapter.
Take a look.
The whole thing, it's right there.
Couldn't even come up with something original.
Why don't you keep this for evidence?
- You gonna be okay?
- Sure I am.
Gonna just keep on living one day at a time.
- How about you?
- I called my wife.
- You did?
- You got me thinking.
Maybe I let her go too easily.
I am proud of you, kid.
Come on.
Let's get you to a real hospital.
- Okay?
- Then the games can really begin.
Sorry.
It's going to be okay.
Just don't think about it.
Yeah.
I just hate hospitals.
- Dang it.
- What?
I left my book at the house.
You know, in case we have to wait.
Shoot!
Um...
I'll look in my purse.
You rock.
You left it on the table.
Thank you.
Promise me you're not gonna leave, all right?
You're not gonna take off when they put me under.
I promise.
I would never leave.
Woman:
Isn't that always the way it works?
Man:
You'd think you see somebody with a crutch, they're gonna help 'em out.
Right, naturally.
Don't even hold the door.
All right, you stay there, please.
Give me one moment.
I can at least get out.
Let me just get the crutch.
Wait, wait.
- I can just stand.
- Come on.
The brace.
You're awesome.
- I love you.
Be careful.
- Love you.
Thank you.
- I'll be right up.
- All right.
Woman #2:
What's this I hear about you taking the morning off?
Woman:
Kevin has orthopedic surgery today.
Aww!
You're such a good girlfriend.
I told you about it.
He's always there for me.
He's amazing.
I think the bank could go one day without me.
You don't mind covering, right?
Of course.
Of course.
So when do I get to meet him?
- I don't know.
- It's been fours months.
- I'm back.
I wanna meet him.
- I know.
I just have never been in a relationship before where it's actually going well.
- How can I help you?
- Hi, where's outpatient surgery?
- Squeezed you in under the wire, huh?
- What do you mean?
We're shutting down for renovations on Saturday.
Most of our patients have already been moved to County West.
- Oh.
- Go through those doors and take the elevator up.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
Tell him we'll give him an extra basis point.
If he's worried about the rates and us not being competitive, tell him to just look at our rates.
Listen, Craig's been on this case.
Just have him deal with it.
If you have any questions, call Craig.
Okay, bye.
Hi.
Hey, baby.
Any trouble parking?
No, but I did finally speak with Christine, who wants us all to grab a pizza this weekend.
Her words.
All of us.
- The best friend that I never get to meet?
- Yes.
That's a biggie.
"Heart disease?" No.
"Rheumatic fever?" No.
- "Snoring?"
- Sometimes.
- Really?
- Yeah.
So you're sure you're okay with this whole introduction thing to your friends?
That's a big step.
No.
Every time I introduce her to anybody, it's sort of bad luck.
Well, don't you worry.
Because you are not gonna lose me.
Ever.
"Social Security number"?
I've been having the hardest time writing on this.
Oh, here, lean on this.
Ahh.
Thank you.
So you must be Kevin Peterson.
- I am.
- I'm Amanda.
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Mary.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Dr. Harding will be in in a moment so I just wanna check some things out.
Okay.
- It's all done.
- Thank you.
Does your wife mind waiting outside?
Oh, well, we're not married.
I don't mind.
Do you have a place I could grab a coffee?
We have a cafeteria attached to the lobby downstairs.
Perfect.
Thank you.
You gonna be okay?
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.
Don't leave me though, right?
- Promise?
- I promise.
Cross my heart, promise.
Okay.
You take care of him.
Oh, how long will it be?
- About an hour.
- An hour?
Really?
- Yep.
- Well, good luck.
Thank you.
See you in an hour.
Just tell him that he has to sign the request form in person.
Yeah, he has to come in.
He already knows that.
Just do it.
I'll tell him if I have to.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Let him know I'll call him back this afternoon.
I'll call you back, bye.
- Let me please.
- Thank you.
Sorry.
There's a garbage...
- Yeah.
- Right there and another one.
Oh, thanks a lot.
- I'm Cooper, by the way.
- Cooper, I'm Mary.
- Mary.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- You want some company?
- Sure.
Well, okay.
So what are you-
- What am I in for?
- I wasn't going to say it quite like that, but yes.
My wife, she has breast cancer, and well, she's up in chemo.
How's it going?
I'm sorry.
Small improvement.
We're keeping our fingers crossed.
- So we'll see what happens.
- I'm sorry.
What about you?
You're not here for the coffee, right?
I'm just here for the day.
My boyfriend's having orthopedic surgery.
He tore his A.C.L.
hiking and flared up an old football injury.
He hurt himself, huh?
Yep.
Keep telling him to take it easy.
You don't like hospitals, do you?
Does anybody like hospitals?
Except for the doctors and nurses?
I've been doing this every week for six months.
And I can't wait till they shut this place down.
- Believe you me.
- Sorry.
Wow, look at you go.
It's my job.
MIT said that 90% of people who use smartphones feel more stress.
Only 90%?
I mean, look at you.
You're sitting in a hospital waiting for your boyfriend, and you're working.
What happened to the days where you could say,
"I'm out of the office," you know?
Well, sir, to the good old days.
- Cheers, Mary.
- Cheers.
Kevin.
Man over P.A.:
Monica Hernandez, your party is ready in post-op.
Jeanette Stevens, Mary Turner, your parties are ready.
- May I help you?
- Yes, please.
Hi.
My boyfriend was having surgery, and I just want to see how much longer it's going to be.
Certainly.
What was his name?
Peterson
- Kevin Peterson.
You're sure?
How are you spelling it?
P-e-t-e-r...
- s-o-n.
Peterson.
- Peterson with an "O."
I'm not showing anyone in our system with that name.
Okay, well, he's definitely having surgery.
- Do you happen to-
- Orthopedics.
Do you happen to remember the room number?
Yeah, it was right down the hall, actually.
This floor.
- What about the doctor's name?
- Room 714.
Harding.
Dr. Harding.
Dr. Harding's off today.
I'm sorry.
There's no one in our system with the name Kevin Peterson.
Well...
Are you sure it could have been in this hospital?
Perhaps it was in another hospital.
We've stopped doing outpatient procedures at this time.
Okay, I was here.
We drove together.
During pre-op, I was in the room with him.
- Lovely nurse came in to prep him.
- What was the nurse's name?
No, what was her name?
Amanda.
Amanda.
- Do you know her?
- Doesn't ring a bell.
Okay.
Maybe orthopedics she's in.
Are you sure that he just didn't leave without you?
I have the keys.
I have the keys to the car.
Okay?
I just wanna know where my boyfriend is.
Can you please help me find him?
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
He's not in our systems.
This is ridiculous.
Would you like me to page him for you?
Thank you.
That would be great.
Kevin Peterson, can you please dial 9 and come to the courtesy phone?
Kevin Peterson, please dial 9.
Kevin Peterson, please dial 9 at the courtesy phone.
Hey, this is Kevin.
Do your business after the beep.
Sweetheart.
Ma'am, you cannot use your cell phone.
- I'll be two seconds.
- You cannot use your cell phone.
I have this nurse that's driving me absolutely crazy.
I'm at the nurses' station on the floor that had a room- 714 was on the last place I saw you.
Right now it is- it's definitely been over an hour.
I can tell you that much.
It's been hours, and I've looked everywhere.
I can't find you.
The second you get this message, okay, you call me.
Okay, baby.
You call me, okay?
Love you.
I love you.
Hi, we met this morning.
You told me where to check in for outpatient surgery.
Kevin Peterson is a patient here.
- His doctor is Dr. Harding.
- Okay.
He is my boyfriend.
I can't find him anywhere.
- Do you remember me from earlier?
- I remember you.
- You were by yourself.
- I was.
I dropped him off in the parking structure, okay.
I don't make mix-ups, and my computer is giving me the correct information.
And there is no Kevin Peterson.
Perhaps it's new information, or something's changed.
I'm looking at my computer printout and I don't see a Kevin Peterson.
I heard you.
Okay.
Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Yes, can I help you?
Yes, please.
I'm looking for someone who's missing.
- Missing
- He's 35, 6'1", dark hair, dark eyes.
I haven't seen anybody by that description.
I'm sorry.
He's wearing a brace on his left leg.
Are you okay?
Ma'am, are you okay?
Excuse me.
Yeah, this is Holloway in the lobby.
Yeah, I've got a young woman who's looking for an unidentified male.
Hi, I'm looking for a patient that's in recovery named Kevin Peterson.
Never heard of him.
Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hi, excuse me.
Can I help you?
Hi, yes, I am looking for Kevin Peterson,
Dr. Harding's patient.
Great, I understand.
This is a restricted area.
- I think he's just back there.
- I understand, ma'am, but I need you to leave the restricted area.
He is an outpatient.
He's recovering.
This is recovery.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
I'm very busy right now.
I'm very sorry.
Okay.
- Hi.
- I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm with a patient.
Look, ma'am, I really need you to get out of this area.
Security, can you take her away, please?
Ma'am, this is a restricted area.
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
This is a restricted area.
You have to leave.
Can you please escort me to Dr. Harding instead?
Yes.
You have to get out of here.
It's a restricted area.
This is her.
And this is Miss Markham, our hospital administrator.
- Thank you.
Hi, thank God.
- How can I help you?
I'm Mary Walsh.
My boyfriend had surgery here this morning.
- He's missing.
- Missing?
- Yes.
- I told her there was no one who's checked into this hospital by the name of Kevin Peterson.
Okay, well, he had orthopedic surgery-
A.C.L.- this morning.
His doctor is Dr. Harding.
Evidently, neither one of them are in your system.
And no one's in his room.
Okay, well, obviously there's been some kind of mistake.
That's what I've been trying to explain to you.
Come with me, please.
Let me see what we can do.
What time this morning was it that you and your boyfriend arrived?
About 7:15.
Surgery started at 8:00.
Okay, and you're the one
- who arrived here with him.
- Correct.
Okay.
Oh...
Rewind that a hair.
Wait, stop.
All right, these numbers don't-
These times don't coincide.
Keep fast-forwarding, please.
We weren't even out of bed yet.
Okay, keep going.
Okay, right here.
We were already here.
Back it up, please.
Okay, now... rewind it just a hair.
Wait, wait.
Wait, did you see that?
Turn it back.
Go back a bit.
Play it from this point.
Good.
Keep playing, please.
Pause!
That's him.
Right there.
That's him.
He's wearing the green and gray striped shirt.
Color accuracy is difficult to determine on closed-circuit cameras.
You've gotta be kidding me.
That's him.
He's right there.
Markham:
Miss Walsh.
Mary:
I'm looking at him, you know?
He may not be in your computer, but he's right on your security camera.
Do you have a copy of his hospital appointment record?
No, it was on him.
Oh God.
It might be in his computer bag in the car.
I will have my team look for him,
- but you know I'm understaffed.
- Yeah.
Where do you think you're going?
I'm gonna go call somebody who can actually help me out here.
I just didn't think there was anything conclusive on that.
Do what you can, but...
- You got it, Miss Markham.
- Thank you.
Yeah, come in.
Man:
Breathe in out, in... out.
- How is it, Doc?
- It's 160 over 100.
You still taking the medication?
Every day.
- What about work?
- What about it?
I don't know, Rich.
Something like this takes time.
You don't wanna rush it.
Heaven forbid.
- I'm gonna increase the dosage though.
- Okay, thanks.
But I really need you to take it easy, man.
Whatever you say, Doc.
All right.
See you on Thursday?
- Wouldn't miss it.
- All right, take care.
- Franklin here.
- Woman:
This is dispatch.
We've got reports of a missing person at County Memorial.
- Are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm still here.
What floor?
Mary:
When I arrived, he wasn't in his room.
So I went down to the waiting room and waited there for a good couple of hours.
Started getting increasingly concerned and went back to his floor and spoke with the head nurse and learned for the first time that he was not in the computer system.
We have looked.
No one by the name of Kevin Peterson was scheduled for anything today, not even a check-up.
What about the nurse, this Amanda?
We don't have anyone on staff by that name,
- and the doctor that he was supposedly-
- Dr. Harding.
scheduled with is on vacation.
Look, if you could just access Kevin's insurance records.
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.
Why?
The insurance company will only release information to the policyholder's spouse.
Okay, but this is an emergency situation.
He's missing.
I'm sorry.
The hospital can't release any information to a non-family member without a court order.
Detective...
I'm getting really really worried that something bad's happened to him.
Can you please help me?
Okay, first of all,
I can't file a report for 24 hours.
24 hours?
I'll be honest with you, Miss Walsh, most of the time we get a call saying a spouse or boyfriend or whatever is missing, usually they just up and left.
Have you considered the possibility that your boyfriend might have walked out on you?
I could see how you two would think that, but that's just not him, no.
- How long have you been together?
- Four months.
Markham:
That's not a lot of time to get to know someone.
Maybe your relationship isn't what you thought it was.
No, I trust him.
Detective Franklin:
Do you have a picture?
Maybe, wait.
I think.
Hold on, I think I do.
Yeah, right here.
Can you make anything out?
Markham:
No.
Well, it's not the best picture.
It's something.
How about a description?
He's 6'0", maybe 6'1".
Around 190.
Brown hair.
Brown eyes.
He was wearing a green and gray shirt today and shorts because he has on a huge leg brace.
And he was using a crutch.
Shirt was long-sleeved.
Security has their people searching the entire hospital and no one has seen anyone matching that description.
I'll see what I can find.
In the meantime, I need you to sit right here.
I feel very awkward just not doing anything and staying here.
Miss Walsh, the more cooperation I can get from you, the faster this can go for everyone.
All right?
Okay?
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
If you hear anything, give me a call.
- Anything I can do to help.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.
Will you excuse me for a minute?
Yes, of course.
Have you seen a male Caucasian, mid 30s, dark hair, wearing dark shorts, green sweatshirt?
Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to recall seeing a male Caucasian mid 30s, wearing a gray-striped hoodie with shorts?
- No.
- Okay, thank you.
Could you tell me where the outpatient surgery is?
Yeah, if you just keep going straight down the hall you'll run right into it.
Woman:
Can I help you, sir?
Yeah, I couldn't help but notice there are no patients on this level.
Yeah, everyone's been moved to another facility.
They are shutting this entire hospital down Saturday for renovation.
You mean no one has been in any of these rooms today?
No.
Are you looking for someone?
I'm fine, thanks.
You wouldn't happen to know of a nurse named Amanda, would you?
Amanda?
No.
- No, no one.
- Are you sure?
I'm the head nurse.
I would know.
- Thanks.
- Have a good day.
Franklin:
Excuse me, I'm looking for a patient by the name of Kevin Peterson...
Excuse me, I'm looking for a guy, mid 30s, 6' tall- Kevin Peterson.
He's wearing a striped hoodie.
You wouldn't happen to recall seeing a male Caucasian, mid 30s, wearing a gray-striped hoodie with shorts?
- Woman:
No.
- Kevin Peterson checked in, mid 30s.
I'm looking for a patient by the name of Kevin Peterson...
By the name of Kevin Peterson...
Kevin Peterson, checked in today.
- Gray-striped hoodie with shorts...
- Woman:
No.
Woman:
Look, I just clock in and I clock out.
You do not recall hearing the name Kevin Peterson today?
Is that right?
Woman:
No.
Mary:
Chris, I'm in the security room at the hospital.
I took Kevin in and he's missing.
Look, slow down, okay?
You're scaring me.
What's going on?
Nobody just disappears.
No, he is missing.
I haven't seen him since the surgery.
I feel like I'm going crazy.
What are you talking about?
Saw him in pre-op.
Boom, went back to the room, gone.
He's not even in the computer system.
He's missing.
Okay, sweetie, you know, you just met Kevin.
Maybe...
He didn't leave me, honey.
Oh my God, sweetheart.
I'm not saying that he left you.
I know we've only been together for four months, but I have been waiting for him my whole entire life.
And I'm not gonna let someone take him away from me.
Okay, do you want me to come there?
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to call the police?
You're scaring me.
No, I already called the police.
That's why the detective's here.
I think I hear somebody coming.
Everybody's acting really strange.
There's something real off here.
I think they're all crazy.
Or I'm the crazy one.
So please, please, just keep checking in.
If I don't answer, come find me, okay?
I'm having the hardest time writing on this.
Oh, here, lean on this.
Ahh.
Thank you.
- So what's going on?
- What's going on?
Well, Miss Walsh,
Detective Franklin is out looking for your boyfriend.
It's been over an hour.
It's a big hospital.
You know, I think I'm gonna look myself.
Listen, I can't have you doing that.
I can't have you walking around the hallway scaring other patients.
Do you understand?
- Hi.
- I've been to all seven floors and not a single person has seen him.
Okay, um...
Then please, I have to file a report.
I told you he needs to be missing for 24 hours.
24 hours is too long.
Anything can happen in 24 hours.
Please, file a report.
What does Kevin do for a living?
He's in insurance.
Well, at least he's covered.
Have you ever been to his office?
Meet any of his colleagues?
No, he's freelance.
He works from the house.
But I did, while you were gone, jot this down for you.
Wait, you just happened to remember it?
I'd appreciate it if you ran it.
I'll see what I can do.
In the meantime, is there anybody else I could talk to?
Anybody who knew he'd be here today?
- What about family?
- Ooh!
His mother.
She lives in Florida, but he was gonna put her number into my phone in case of an emergency.
I just totally forgot.
Thank you.
Okay.
Wait.
The number you have reached is not in service at this time.
- There is no new number.
- No luck.
He must have input a wrong digit.
He's always been bad electronically.
Shoot!
You need proof.
You need some sort of evidence that this is real, that he actually exists, don't you?
- Antidepressants.
- I, uh-
I have a prescription for that, so...
Holloway:
That kind of says it all, doesn't it?
Please hand that to me.
I'll be right back, Mr. Holloway.
Where are you going?
May I have my medication back, please?
Detective Franklin, we have people here she can talk to.
I'm sure Miss Markham could arrange something.
All right, I'll run the Social.
I'll be back.
You got it.
Come on.
- Wait wait.
- Just stay out of the way.
Come on.
Your brace.
Do you want your bag?
No, just leave it in the back.
That's fine.
Thank God.
Where is it?
Okay, wanna come upstairs now?
Shoot!
Holloway:
It's not under the seat.
Shoot!
Wanna come upstairs now?
- It's not here.
- What's not here?
His bag.
It has his computer in it, all of his information- everything.
Somebody had to have gotten into the car.
What makes you think that?
Because the bag was here this morning.
Now it's not.
- It was right there.
- Miss Walsh, we need to speak with you.
Now.
I have the only set of keys.
Now.
We're in the middle of a huge transition.
I've got patients to move, equipment to transport.
Every minute that I or my security team spends chasing phantoms on surveillance cameras or finding you trespassing in a restricted area is one less minute we're able to do our jobs.
Every minute you don't spending looking for Kevin is a minute wasted.
Mary, I checked seven floors of this building.
I checked with every nurse's station.
I checked the emergency room.
I checked the intensive care ward.
What about the wing that's being renovated?
Franklin:
Yes.
- And?
- And no one reported seeing your boyfriend.
No one can even confirm that he was in this hospital.
Just what do you suppose happened to him?
- I don't know.
- Holloway:
Look, there are 23 exits in this facility.
Six are manned by my men.
Eight are alarmed and the rest are carefully monitored by cameras.
If anyone left this building under any manner of duress we would know about it.
Well, obviously, you're not looking hard enough.
- Detective...
- Detective Franklin.
- Detective, who is it?
- Really?
Okay, thank you.
What did they say?
We ran the Social Security number you gave me.
Good, okay, what's the next step?
It belongs to a 50-year-old African-American woman.
Well, that's obviously a mistake.
Not ours.
I ran the number you gave us.
No, that's impossible.
Okay, run them again, please?
Dr. Bensley, thank you for joining us.
I'd like to introduce you to someone.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello.
Markham:
Dr. Bensley is our hospital psychiatrist.
I don't need a psychiatrist.
Did you get the prescription I sent over?
I did.
Quite a potent dosage, Mary.
Would you mind coming with me for a moment?
Yes, actually, I would.
It doesn't need to be voluntary, Miss Walsh.
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
Right this way, please.
This way.
- Okay.
- Come on.
So you've been treated for psychiatric issues before, hmm, Mary?
Answer the question, Miss Walsh.
I...
I checked myself in when I was 22.
I was in grad school.
I was under a lot of stress.
I was there for three days.
That's it.
I don't see how that's relevant.
What are you doing on antidepressants?
Oh, you think I'm making this up.
You think that, what, my imaginary boyfriend went missing?
You're an only child.
Your father left when you were young.
Your mother died earlier this year in a hospital.
Yes, February.
She went in for a routine check-up and never checked out.
She had a blood infection.
So it's not surprising that your subconscious would choose a hospital to fabricate-
It's not my subconscious anything.
Oh my Lord!
This is real.
He was there for me.
You know, I remember her funeral.
- He was at it.
- Kevin?
Yes, Kevin.
I know it's hard to lose somebody you care deeply about, Mary.
It's very understandable how someone in your situation could suffer a psychological break.
You work long hours.
You've lost your emotional support system.
You're alone.
It's only natural for the brain to reach for something, anything, to grab onto.
He drove us here.
He did.
And I remember the ride like the back of my hand.
He- he- he was-
He was chewing on the lid of his coffee cup.
- It's this little nervous habit that he has.
- Sorry.
I know that it all must seem real.
It seems real because it is real!
I remember walking through the parking structure.
Memory is a very vivid and powerful sensation, Mary.
It is real!
This whole situation is real.
And he's here.
He was here,
He's somewhere right now in this hospital and we're wasting time!
The nurse advised me to get coffee, said the surgery would be an hour.
It was 25 minutes, and he's gone.
It was real.
It's all right, Mary.
Can I just have a moment alone?
Take all the time you need, dear.
I'll be in my office next door.
Okay.
Mary, I-
Security.
Want some company?
Do you know I was just here for a checkup today?
Doctor told me I need to take it easy.
Then you call.
I gotta tell you, this job can really take its toll on you- your health, your marriage.
You're married?
Was.
Marriage, it can be a funny thing, you know?
You commit yourself, you hand your heart over to someone, but it always seems like it's the little things that keep chipping away at it-
Little disagreements.
She- she hated the fact that I was a cop.
And you know what?
Maybe- maybe she was right.
I don't know.
I was working a gang shooting over in Glassell Park, and my partner and I, we traced the shooter back to his girlfriend's house.
He'd been shacking up there for a couple of weeks.
And we had the kid cornered, so we went in.
He was unarmed, gave himself right up.
What we didn't know that his girlfriend was in the house.
The last thing I remember before I blacked out... was watching my partner... his dark lifeless eyes as he fell to the floor.
Now look at me.
I've got a desk job and high blood pressure and a doctor telling me how to live my life.
What I'm- what I'm trying to say here is that...
I understand what you're going through.
Can you please tell Dr. Bensley that... he can just do whatever needs to do, all right?
Mary's behavior is definitely indicative of someone in the midst of an emotional breakdown.
And yet I never met anyone with such conviction in her delusion.
She absolutely believes that everything that's happening is real.
She's emotionally lost.
Yeah, this Bensley.
Listen, I wanna put Mary Walsh under 72-hour observation.
Mm-hmm.
Possible mental illness.
Mr. Holloway, this is J.J.
I have her in the hallway.
Switching to camera 2.
I'm following her along the hallway.
I have her.
- Do not lose her.
Sir, it looks like she's heading towards sublevel "B"- boiler room and laundry.
We only have limited coverage down there.
I'm en route right now.
Dr. Bensley, what are we dealing with here?
Is she dangerous?
It's impossible to say.
Acute perception of persecution, paranoia.
You just never know how someone like this will act when pushed too far.
No, no.
No cameras, none.
No parking lot.
No exits.
No.
I can't find her anywhere.
We only got a couple of cameras operational in that area, so it's not gonna be easy.
I'm gonna keep on scanning.
Wait, I think I've got something.
Boom!
Camera 4 in the boiler room.
She's wearing blue scrubs.
It looks like she's heading towards the morgue.
She's running.
She's on the move.
I'm gonna lose her.
You had a chance to talk with her.
Is she currently on meds?
Yeah, quite a potent dosage.
Okay, so this could be some sort of psychotic reaction.
It could indeed.
Hello.
Kevin:
Hello, it's me.
My God, Kevin.
Where are you?
I don't know.
Somewhere in the hospital.
What's happening?
Listen to me, okay?
Don't trust anyone.
I don't know how many people are involved in this.
It's very important, okay?
- What do they want?
- I don't know.
She has to be close by.
She couldn't have gone too far.
Check all the rooms on that wing.
Look around you.
Where are you?
Where are you right now?
I'm in a bathroom somewhere.
Are you okay?
Are you safe?
Where are you?
I don't- hold on.
Um...
I'm in the morgue.
- Can you get down here?
- No, no!
Leave me alone!
Kevin.
Kevin.
Kevin!
Kevin.
Miss Walsh.
Miss Walsh, you in here?
I got her.
She's heading towards the parking garage.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
This is a first date.
- We don't kiss on the first date.
- Third.
Fifth date.
Gonna wait?
This could take awhile.
I think I've done all I can do.
Sorry she sent you on such a wild goose chase.
Yeah, it happens.
- Good afternoon, Doc.
- Detective.
Cooper:
Hi, Mary.
- Hello.
- Shh.
I heard what happened.
These are for you.
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
The doctor thought you needed some more time to recuperate.
The cop
- I think he might have left.
Thank you.
They think I'm crazy.
I'm not.
I'm not crazy.
No, you're not crazy.
That's why I came down here.
I want to discuss the situation about Kevin and how you could see him again.
You do wanna see him again, right?
Do you know where he is?
Now don't get yourself worked up, young lady.
You did make quite a spectacle of yourself, Miss Walsh.
The emotional outburst, the panicking.
We expected that, but the accident.
Oh, my my, Mary, I mean, you've got to be more careful.
"Mary Catherine Walsh, unmarried, regional operations manager for the Empyrean International Bank. "
You rent a condo in Reseda.
Your mother died four months ago, but the bank got your house in the reverse mortgage.
That's true.
- How do you know this?
- I did my research.
But your bank, on the other hand, recently received from the federal government a $2 billion bailout.
Now I've seen the bonus structure, rewarding their executives while letting their customers go bankrupt, huh?
And you have access to unlimited funds.
Don't you hurt him.
Don't you hurt him!
So...
- How much?
- $10 million.
I've taken the liberty to get Kevin's computer.
Inside here you'll find the account and wire routing numbers of a bank account in the Cayman Islands.
Once I receive confirmation of funds received,
I'll let your boyfriend go.
Shit.
I have no Wi-Fi signal.
I checked it myself.
It's fine.
Yeah, I don't have a wireless signal in this room.
I need a hard line.
I need to move to a different location.
Yeah, it's me.
Yeah, cut off Peterson's finger.
No, wait!
Wait!
Tell him no.
Look at this right here.
This is our signal.
There is none.
I've tried every single network,
- and there's nothing.
- Hold that for one second.
I need you to move me to a place where I can plug in a different computer.
I can get it done in no time, okay?
Yeah, all right.
I've got 26 minutes till the cutoff, which is exactly how much time you've got to find a computer to get me my money.
You're being watched.
We know everything you do.
If you fail, Kevin dies.
If you tell anyone, Kevin dies.
If you leave the hospital, Kevin dies.
Got it.
Here's your clothing.
I found it downstairs.
Meet me on sublevel "B" when you're done.
Wonderful.
Miss Walsh?
Mr. Holloway, that crazy Mary Walsh lady is back wandering the halls.
She's looking for a patient that does not appear to be in our system.
She needs be escorted out immediately.
- I'll alert Miss Markham.
- Thank you.
We have footage of Miss Walsh in the trauma recovery room.
J.J., punch up everything on level 3, would you, please?
- Thank you.
- You got it.
- Holloway:
There you go.
- I wanted somebody on that door.
Unfortunately, the nurse stepped away.
You don't really think she's dangerous, do you?
I'm not taking any chances.
Besides, with her injuries, her well-being is my responsibility.
Trust me.
She's still here, and we will find her.
I have my people turning this place upside down.
Well, let me know the minute you hear anything.
I'm going back upstairs.
You got it, Miss Markham.
Thank you.
$10 million.
$10 million.
Please work.
Hello.
Mary:
Kevin.
- Mary, Mary.
- Oh, Kevin.
Are you hurt?
He's fine.
Let him go.
- The receipt.
- I need to email a confirmation code to complete the wire transfer.
So I would suggest that you let him go now.
Move it!
Honey.
I thought I lost you forever.
The code, come on!
Done.
Come on, let's go up those stairs.
We could get away.
Just go right up those stairs.
Well, I'm glad you made it safely.
I understand you're from Missouri.
Is that correct?
Yeah, Kansas City.
- Is that near St. Louis?
- Other side of the state.
Excuse me one second.
Royal Cayman Bank Trust.
This is Barry.
Yeah, Conyers.
Yeah, it's me.
Did it go through?
Yes, sir.
As a matter of fact, it's pending right now.
We're on, guys.
Thank you, Miss Walsh.
Great work, baby.
I mean, fantastic.
Kevin:
It's a good thing too.
Just in time, 'cause this brace is really starting to make my leg really stiff.
Kevin, what are you doing?
Cooper:
Haven't you been paying any attention?
There is no Kevin Peterson.
Kevin.
Oh my God.
Where are you?
I don't know.
I'm in the hospital somewhere.
Can you get down here?
- No, no, leave me alone!
- Kevin.
There is no...
Kevin Peterson.
Kevin, Kevin!
Kevin.
Don't you hurt him.
Don't you hurt him.
Oh, my.
So how much?
Franklin:
What about the nurse, this Amanda?
- So you must be Kevin Peterson.
- Yeah.
- I'm Amanda.
- Markham:
We don't have anyone
- by that name.
- See you in an hour.
- Mary:
Lovely nurse came in to prep him.
- What was the nurse's name?
Mary:
Uh, no...
Amanda.
- My boyfriend is Kevin Peterson...
- Come here, come here.
...and we can't find him.
My wife, she has breast cancer.
Well, she's up in chemo.
That's him right there.
Color accuracy is difficult to determine with closed-circuit cameras.
You know, Detective Franklin, we have people here she can talk to.
I'm sure Miss Markham could arrange something, if need be.
Mary:
Everything is a lie?
Everything is a lie?
Every- every- everything everything is a lie.
- Don't take it personally, Mare.
- Mare bear.
- Don't touch me.
The man you fell in love with... he's not real.
I'm a real idiot.
Didn't he tell you about his time in prison?
That's where I met the guy.
Believe me, if I was any younger, I would have done this myself.
No no no, Coop.
You couldn't handle her.
She's a real tiger cat between the sheets.
Oh, I don't know, Coop.
I think you could have handled her.
Holloway:
All we had to do was sit back and watch you lose it.
It was simple.
Mare bear, for old times' sake.
- Come on in.
- Don't you dare touch me.
- Don't touch me.
- Allow me.
Boys, I think it's time to go.
All right, Holloway, you know the drill.
Amanda.
I'll send you a postcard.
I'm sorry.
Victoria Markham's office, please.
It's Detective Franklin.
Tell her it's urgent.
What do you mean she disappeared?
Where'd she go?
Look, I think she's telling us the truth about her boyfriend.
She's messed up in something.
I don't know what it is.
I think she's in some kind of trouble.
Just find her.
Just find her!
I'm on my way there right now.
Whoo!
$10 million feels good, doesn't it, babe?
Baby, gimme a kiss.
You know, I almost feel bad.
Amanda:
Oh, yeah, why is that?
Almost, but I can think of 10 million reasons why not.
Come on!
Up!
Get up those stairs.
Come on!
Don't fight me!
Yeah, you're a fighter, ain't you?
I believe Stevie once said you were an animal in bed.
Easy easy.
Shh!
Yeah.
Damn, you're fine.
I wanna show you something.
- All right.
- Yeah.
Maybe I shouldn't let you go just yet.
What are you reaching for down there?
- It's my phone.
- What about your phone?
The transfer.
You know they were talking about the transfer?
Yeah, what about it?
It's still pending.
Really?
You pulling another one of your tiger moves?
- Is that it?
- I could take that money and I could transfer it right into your account with just the click of a button.
What do you mean I could have the money?
I'll prove it to you.
I'll do it right here.
Look.
Slowly, do it slowly.
Let me see.
Oh!
Mary, where's my little lamb?
Mary!
Where you at?
Holloway:
Mary!
Mary.
We got 23 exits.
We checked 22.
Really?
You think I did a good job?
Yes, you in the naughty nurse's outfit was really something.
Thanks, baby.
I was so nervous.
Hey, look, don't get too excited.
- Give Holloway a call.
- All right.
Kevin:
Hello, Holloway.
Sounds like you're out of breath.
Mare bear... is that you?
I can hear you breathing.
And I know your breath.
Where's Holloway?
You didn't kill Holloway, did you?
I didn't know you had it in you.
Mary.
Mary, listen to me.
I'm coming for you, Mary.
I'm coming down there.
You just stay put, sweets.
We can sort this all out.
I'm coming for you.
Damn it!
Holloway screwed up.
She's not dead.
Just relax.
I'll get the money, okay?
We'll get the money!
I thought you said you knew this chick, Steve.
I do.
I told you, she's smart.
- Hello.
- Barry:
I'm afraid there's been a problem.
The wire's been reversed.
Cooper:
What are you talking about?
The bank recalled the money.
Can't do that.
- It's not my call, sir.
- That's not good enough.
Sir, there's nothing more that I can do, okay?
It's not on my end.
I did what you told me to do.
- I did what you asked me to do.
- I'll get them to rescind it.
Sir, do whatever you have to do, sir.
I'm sorry.
We gotta go back.
Get us back to the hospital.
I'll take care of it myself.
I'll put a bullet in her head right now.
Turn around here.
Son of a bitch!
There she is!
End of the road, baby.
All right, you take the wheel.
Meet us topside.
Woman:
All units, three armed suspects spotted in hospital parking garage driving silver sedan.
All units respond.
Shh shh shh.
Wait wait.
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.
- Where'd they go?
- They went that way.
- Chill out!
- You stay right here.
You hear me?
Right here!
I need backup at County Hospital now.
Mary honey, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Mare bear.
No!
No, don't hit her.
We need her information.
Honey, Mary.
He's sorry.
Mare.
Mary:
Please stop!
Cooper, put the gun down.
You're a smart girl, Walsh.
There's no good way out of this.
Don't be stupid.
I'm gonna put my gun down.
I'm gonna do it right here.
I'll go my way.
You go yours, okay?
Drop your weapon, Cooper.
Coop... you okay?
Kevin:
Whoa whoa whoa!
Where'd you get a gun, honey?
Put it away.
Stay where you are.
Whoa whoa whoa.
Baby, I'll put this away.
Take it easy.
This is a whole different side of you
I've never seen.
And how do you feel about that side?
I like it.
I like it a lot.
Me too.
Baby, this whole thing has gotten completely out of hand.
You were never supposed to get hurt.
Okay?
Look, we can work this out.
Okay, listen, forget these guys, okay?
Why don't you and I just take the money?
You can resend it.
We'll take it.
We can be anybody we wanna be.
We can go anywhere we wanna go.
Think about that.
No no no, it started off about money, but now, I mean, honey, everything's changed.
I would hate for you to see four months of wasted time and effort.
I would really hate it.
It would hurt me.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
So you and I, we could take the money together.
Right here.
And it could happen just with the push of a little button.
We can go anywhere we want to.
We can be anybody we want to.
Think about it.
Baby, that sounds pretty fantastic.
You... always told me I was priceless.
Baby, you are priceless... to me.
Just didn't know that I was a $10 million catch!
No!
Mary.
See now, I'm gonna have to break up with you.
For real!
Mare!
Mary.
Mary, don't move.
Stay right there!
Don't move.
I'm gonna come to you.
You're okay.
Stay right there.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
- Detective Franklin.
- Mm-hmm.
Before we go up there and see all those people,
I just wanted to ask, why did you believe me?
This.
You left it in the chapel.
What about this?
The last chapter.
Take a look.
The whole thing, it's right there.
Couldn't even come up with something original.
Why don't you keep this for evidence?
- You gonna be okay?
- Sure I am.
Gonna just keep on living one day at a time.
- How about you?
- I called my wife.
- You did?
- You got me thinking.
Maybe I let her go too easily.
I am proud of you, kid.
Come on.
Let's get you to a real hospital.
- Okay?
- Then the games can really begin.
I understand.
I'll call again before we arrive.
Yes.
Ren-san.
It seems there are reporters different from the usual waiting at the airport.
Why?
That's fine.
It'll be good advertisement.
Why is this so slow?

What about the fact that she is the only daughter of Mastpole's president?
Are you considering a business partnership with Mastpole?
a comment please.
coming through.
A comment please!
Will Yuzuki-san be at the opening party in Shanghai?
won't she?
Excuse me.
Where did you arrange to meet?
Really?
President Hazuki and Ohnuki Yuzuki are supposedly coming to Shanghai on a premarital vacation.
I'm thankful for that.
We haven't paid them but the media is that worked up.
I'm excited though.
I've never seen President Hazuki in person.
He doesn't like being called "President" so don't call him that.
And!
you can only say those things because you haven't seen him flip everything upside down.
What do you mean by "flip upside down"?
The dinner table.
Hello!
Good morning!
Morning!
Morning!
Maemi-san!
Maemi-san!
Morning!
Good morning.
It's about this.
Let's go for more of a vivid feeling.
right?
How about adding some red?
Red?
we'll do that.
I'll leave it to you.
Okay.
Jin-san wants you to take a look at this.
Jin-san!
This?
The shelf is kind of high.
It's a huge problem.
The workers seem to have occupied the grounds of the factory that Regolith bought.
We subcontractors only have to worry about making this place look good.
Stop worrying about that and get to work!

Understood.
Yes.
Yes.
I understand.
Just have everyone gather for now.
Yes.
Be careful so those people don't get injured.
That's disgusting.
Not yet?
Let's begin.
Please. the possibility that we will incur losses is impossible.
It can not happen.
the factory workers have not listened to anything we have said and continue to be on strike. we are consulting a lawyer.
that's it.
That is all.
You're right that there is nothing wrong in terms of paperwork.
there may be difficulties with business so proceed with taking down the factory as planned.
Pardon?
As planned?
The opening day in Shanghai is approaching so we can't stop even for a day.
But the workers refuse to move... you may return to Japan.
Please remain at home until Human Resources contacts you.
What?
Yes.

What does this mean?
I am positive I just said that there are no problems on our side.
wasn't it?
Thanks for your work.
Um...
A word if I may... there are multiple candidates but a final decision has yet to be made. it would be best if Ren-san decided at the final audition.
Fine.
The candidates that have been chosen are we have Anna Olivia.
She has participated in the Paris and London Collections.
It's nice.
It's good.
Is it?
It is!

Thank you for your work.
Thank you.
Hazuki in-person.
Stop that!
Sorry.
Take everything down.
Did he just flip the set dinner table?
pretty much.
Does this mean the opening date has been postponed?
It's still as planned.
The reconsideration is?
We've been working with the minimum.
we won't make it.
The situation's changed.
That's your mistake.
There may be a need to reconsider how you treat your customers.
So it's always the site that makes you pay?
Hey. and make an area that customers can relax.
Also remove all the printing.
Also!
Listen to me!
Take out all the vividly colored items and change it to something softer.

Do I smell sweaty?
everyone stayed overnight.
will we really get the factory back if we do this?
They didn't say.
Why?
Is it because of your mother?
It's almost time for her to take her medicine.
Pretend you're going to the bathroom and go out the back.
Leave this to me.
But...
It's fine so go!
I'll take care of it.
I'll be right back.
I'll bring some perfume too.
Watch where you're going!
I understand.
Thank you.
Ren-san.
It seems we will be able to proceed as planned.
What does this look like?
At first sight?
Hm.
A flower?
I got it.
It's a star.
It's probably not.
What's wrong?
I'm sure there was an original answer but I can't remember it.
What was it?
That's disgusting.
Hey.
It's dangerous there.
I said it's dangerous.

But I love Japan.
I will now return.

not a model.
Yes.
isn't it? she was once the poster model for the factory.
She is probably like an idol for the workers. we can stop the rebelling and she will appeal to the people.
Her name is Liu Xiu Mei. she is a laborer.
she is residing in an underdeveloped area of Shanghai with only her bedridden mother.
She works at the furniture factory and she is taking care of the medicine and living expenses. her situation is probably very difficult.
It seems she is getting eviction notices.

That isn't a problem.
That is all regarding the model.
I have a proposal for everyone here.
This riot has been weighing heavily on my mind.
So.
I'd like to announce the design of a new product.
Please let the designers in Tokyo know about this.
Please.
But there are only 10 days left until the opening!
It's 9 days until the rehearsal.

No way.

I'll go with a better man.

Yes!
Cheers~

That's good.
I see.
So it has to be a mature man.
What?
I was wondering what kind of person was your type.
It's not a problem of mature or not.
There are a lot of bad guys out there.
What?
Yes.
Bad guys?
A playboy or and so on.
But now...
It's easier being single.
Please let me hear all about that next time.
But please don't overwork yourself.
I told you no!
As if I'd be the model for the company that bought the factory!
You're annoying!
how's your mother?
She's gotten much better.
That's good to hear.
You be careful too.
Yes.
Thank you!
I'll come again!
I'm sorry!
Are you okay?

What happened?
Since I can't work in the factory anymore...
I have to do at least this at night.

President Hazuki Rensuke of Regolith explained the circumstances at the press conference.
That person is the president of Regolith?

I know that person.
The terms of the contract will remain the same so
I ask the workers to rest assured.
With regard to this riot...
You idiot. on a premarital vacation...
Dad!

Call me when you get there.
I don't have an invitation.
The media's talking.

Chance? you're aiming for a merger.
That's what a trader told me.
Foolishness.

By "serious"...
You're not thinking of...
Then!
I'll see you in Shanghai.

They're no different from the products we sell in Japan.
time...
What did you use that time for?
didn't I?
I don't want to go today.
Xiu Mei.
Don't be difficult.
you're Chinese!
Why do you speak in Japanese?
I was born and raised in Japan.
I'm different from you.
Listen up.
I'm doing this for my mother.
If it wasn't for...
Talk in Japanese.
Let's keep in touch.
Let's drink our fill tonight!
Cheers!
Cheers!
I'm here.
Sorry.
I don't have time right now.
What?
Wait a minute.
Then should I help out?
I have the time and I don't have to deal with the company.
It's Ohnuki Yuzuki!
Yuzu!
Yuzu-chan~
She's really pretty!
Wait!
What?
I'll do anything.
It seems the hotel's massages are really good.
Not that.
Wait.
You'll really do anything?
I will!
Hey you!
Why are you throwing it away?
Pick it up!
Why am I doing this?
This is hilarious!
She's a total amateur.
Shut up!
Somebody take her out.
wanna drink?
You've got to be kidding me.

My hand slipped.
Excuse me.
You look good as a panda.
Old bag.
What should I have?
what is this?
Jintofu"?
Pig.
Pork?
Sounds good.
Break the head bone.
The brain and the eye...
Forget it.
Can I sit here?
This is Steamed Pig Brain Tofu.
I heard shark fin is good in Shanghai.
Here it is.
should we have him pay?
Don't call me that.
I'm only saying it because I'm trying to use easy Japanese.
Are you okay?
please?
What?
Huh?
Huh?
Right.
Xiu Mei.
A quiz.
What does this look like?
What?
I don't know it in Japanese.
What's the kanji for it?
Kanji.
Water turtle?
What's a water turtle?
What's that?
It's a water strider!
That's right.
The four coins are the ripples made by a water strider when it's floating.
Nice thinking.
Are there water striders in China?
Not in Shanghai.
They can't live in Shanghai's water.
The water needs to be clean.
I see.
A water strider is an indicator.
It's an indicator that tells you if the water is clean.
How do you know...
I feel happy.
When I see a water strider.
What?
My father told me this when I was little.
A person who finds a water strider will be happy.
That's why
I always looked for it.
Happiness...
Why happiness?
Rain falls.
The city becomes clean.
The flowers and trees and rice
grows.
That's why.
there's happiness. happiness... huh...
Please move inside since it is raining.
Good night.
Xiu Mei.
I'm here to give back the money.
Only half of it is left though...
I don't need it.
Xiu Mei.
Xiu Mei!
I have something I need to tell you!
Let go!
Please listen.
Actually...
You've been tricked.
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me to draw the design exactly as you tell me?
There's no time to argue.
We're opening tomorrow.
So you're going to ignore all of my ideas.
Sorry but...
It's as you said.
Sorry.
I can't do that kind of work. ask another designer.
Ninomiya!
What?
right?
isn't it?
What?
You're too close.
Then you should have said so from the beginning.
Idiot.
What's wrong?
Xiu Mei ran away.
It seems a friend told her everything.
Hirabata go to where her mother is.
Koizumi and Kusahara go to her house.
We'll look around everywhere we can think of.
we'll go to the police.
Understood.
please wait here.
We'll call you as soon as we find her.
Oh SMAP!
Subs
I thought there weren't any water striders around here. you have to bear it and give it your all.
let's go.
Weren't you working hard for you mother?
Let's go.
Let go!
You lying bastard!
it's all your doing!
You think I'll work for you!
I won't work.
I quit.
I was worried about my mom.
That's why I worked hard.
But it's impossible.
It's over.
I won't forgive you.
but pay back the money.
The rent I paid in your stead.
everything.
Your mother will probably be kicked out soon.
It'll be your fault for running away.
What happens to your family from now on is not my business.
It has nothin..
I don't care if you resent me.
I don't care if you don't forgive me.
I want you.
I want you.
Morning.
As expected.
What's the point of being complimented when there aren't any competitors?
There were.
A lot.
You had other designers do it too?
Yeah.
Yeah"?
You lied with such a normal face.
Make this into a presentation file.
What?
wait!
What about Xiu Mei?
Was she okay?
She was.
I was with her until just now.
And...
What'd you do?
What'd you do?
I looked for water striders.
Water strider?
I'm leaving.
huh...
It's the opening of the Regolith's First Shanghai Branch!
Thank you for coming all the way here.
I heard there were some problems?
We managed to make it.
She's my daughter so please don't let the second end in trouble.
My manager tells me not to talk freely about it.
Could you tell us what you call each other?
You want me to say it here?
Please.
So...
What the?
The Amenbo Stool.
Amenbo" is water strider.
this chair has the wish that Shanghai can also become a place where the water strider can live.
It has been designed for the opening of the Shanghai branch.
Everyone.
Welcome to Regolith's opening party of the Shanghai Branch...
It's almost time for you to go on.
What's wrong?
It'll be fine.
Have some confidence.
Maemi-san.
Yeah?
Can I... trust him?
Can I do my best while trusting him?
We met her in Shanghai.
It is the birth of the new symbol of Regolith.
Liu Xiu Mei.
She pisses me off.
Xiu Mei!
you're so pretty!
You're the most beautiful person in the world!
Min!
Xiu Mei!
Xiu Mei!

They're looking at you because you're beautiful.
Do you... want to see him?
Tell me something that's better about you.
I'm better at sex.
Welcome!
I want to live here.
Please reconsider.
There's no need.
I don't like how you do business.
This is your job.
Cinderella jumped into the arms of her prince.
7:30, Halsted!
Nice one, loser!
How many's that?
92 and counting.
We're supposed to get out today for a bit.
Step nine, making amends.
Can't wait.
Let's go.
Good morning.
He hit on me yesterday.
Nice one, douchebag!
Hey, pick that up.
Hey!
Hey!
- Come on!
- You're dead.
All right, tough guy.
You too.
Thank you.
There you go.
I need you to sit down.
- What are you looking at, huh?
- Fuck...
Get me out of this place, please.
I know it isn't easy, but taking that step towards reconciliation with the people most hurt by your addictions, that's the door to recovery.
Okay, we're gonna keep working at this.
This is mandatory policy now in all rehabilitation centres.
Each and every one of you will be participating.
You're gonna be getting a day pass every day this week, so get out there and make good use of your time.
Remember, don't rush, all right?
Every step is a good one...
Okay, so, I have a proposition for you.
- I don't think I want to hear this...
- I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
- Okay.
- I don't know how to...
- Are you holding it?
- Yeah, I'm holding it.
So you put it...
Hey, Charlotte.
- No, hey, Char...
- I don't want to talk to you, Kyle.
Charlotte, come on, I'm-I'm still your brother.
No, I don't want to talk to him...
Well, well.
If it isn't one of our illustrious alumni.
If you and whatever drugs you're selling aren't off the school property in the next 30 seconds,
I'm going to call the police.
All third-floor staff to the nurses' station...
Hey, Dad.
How you doing?
What do you want?
Are they-are they treating you all right?
What the fuck do you want, you little prick?
Huh?
I told you I never wanted to see you again.
You get out of my sight.
Ten years because of you, you fuckin' dope fiend.
You fuckin' coward!
If I see you again, I will fucking kill you!
If you come back here, I'll fucking kill you!
I swear, I'll kill you!
Okay, so let's talk about today's adventures.
Kyle?
Do I have to?
Please.
I went to see my sister.
- Okay, and how did that go?
- Not very well.
Can you elaborate?
No.
- Kyle...
- He doesn't want to talk about it.
Talking is the only way to move forward.
Oh, fuck you and move forward!
Fuck this whole place!
None of this makes any fucking difference to us!
Fuck, I hate Bob.
He's a cock.
He's a fuckin' idiot.
It's "make amends" day.
Good to see you.
Sorry about all that money I stole.
Yeah, sorry for ruining your life.
Oh, wait a minute, you ruined my life.
It's all fucking bullshit anyways.
Speaking of which.
Sonia...
There's a call for you.
My dad just died.
I wish that I had known
In that first minute we met
The unpayable debt
That I owed you
'Cause you'd been abused by that bone that refused you
And you hired me to make up for that...
Just after 11:00 this morning, an unidentified man threw himself off the Mission City dam.
Authorities believe he died on impact, but crews are still dredging the reservoir to find his body.
In Mission City...
Fuck...
Let's go!
7:30, Halsted!
Nice one, loser!
It's weird.
What?
93, right?
Yeah, should be 93, but... 92.
Let's go.
Good morning.
Nice one, douchebag!
All right, funny guy, clean it up.
What?
Right now.
- Right now.
- Shit...
All of it.
Did you guys see that?
- Fuck you, Bob.
- Get back here.
Dick.
Hey...
Get back here!
That was fucking weird.
Okay, so, I have a proposition for you.
I don't think I want to hear this proposition.
I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
How did you steal this?
I took it from her purse like I take everything, okay?
- I don't know how to...
- Okay, just hold it.
Okay, okay, I'm holding it.
- Okay, right?
- Yeah.
Now you have to put it to your lips like you're French.
- Okay.
- Okay.
You'll never get that!
All third-floor staff to the nurses' station...
Pick up the fuckin' phone.
What?
Pick up the goddamn phone.
I told you I never wanted to see you again!
You get outta my sight!
10 years 'cause of you!
You fuckin' dope fiend!
You fuckin' coward!
I see you again, I will fucking kill you!
If you come back here, I'll fucking kill you!
I swear, I'll kill you!
Well, well.
If it isn't one of our illustrious alumni.
If you and whatever drugs you're selling are not off the school property in the next 30 seconds,
I'm calling the police.
Okay, so let's talk about today's adventures.
Kyle?
Yeah?
What did you do today?
Uh...
I went to see my sister.
And how did that go for you?
Not very well.
Can you elaborate on that, please?
No.
Halsted.
Halsted.
Kyle...
Kyle...
What the fuck is going on?
How is this even possible?
I mean...
Wait...
The storm.
Last night, the power went out, right?
I was in the rec room and I-I touched the TV.
I got this shock.
That's the last thing I remember.
Same thing happened with me with my light.
- Weeks?
- Who cares how it happened?
The real question is, what are we gonna do with it?
What were you doing last night?
- What were you doing?
- I was in the shower, okay?
I got shocked, too.
Then what?
I don't remember.
Me neither.
The same thing happened to all of us.
Fuck, I'm gonna get that call again.
Uh, Sonia, there's a call for you.
Exactly the same.
You all right?
Shouldn't we be doing something?
We just lived through the same day twice.
Are we just gonna sit here and waste it?
Last night, on the news...
There's-there's a jumper at the dam.
Let's go.
Let's do it.
- What about curfew?
- Fuck curfew.
- Shit, we gotta stop him.
- No, it's...
It's too late.
Couldn't sleep.
Me neither.
At least you went to see him.
I didn't.
I thought you went to the hospital.
I went to the hospital, but...
I just couldn't go into his room.
What do you think 'd happen if we just...
Stayed in here all night?
Trouble for sure.
Then I'm not leaving.
Why do you think this is happening to us?
- Sorry.
- No, it's...
It's okay.
7:30, Halsted!
Bob!
What?
What day is it?
Last time I checked, it was Wednesday.
Look, we're gonna figure this out.
We're not gonna figure out shit, okay?
We're gonna keep repeating the same day over and over again until we go completely out of our fucking minds.
Okay, but, look, we each had the same shock of electricity or whatever, right?
So...
So, what?
So maybe that's something that we do?
Okay, you go and electrocute yourself then, sister, but I'm gonna enjoy it while I got it.
God, what is that girl's problem?
You know, if you think about it, it doesn't really matter what we do today.
Right?
I mean, I could take a piss in group.
As a matter of fact, I could just piss on Bob.
Tomorrow, it'd be like it never happened.
Yeah.
I don't know, man.
I... just feel like we shouldn't mess with it, you know?
What do you think we should do with it?
I don't know.
Pull it out and put it back.
- What?
- The bottle of gin.
I can see it in your pants.
- Pull it out and put it back!
- It's not in my pants.
What do you call that?
Put it back!
You know what, both of you, get the hell out of my store!
Both of you, get out!
Idiots!
- Feeling better?
- Oh, starting to.
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
Oh, no, dude.
We'd better pray tomorrow repeats.
Fuck!
You're sick!
Sick!
Oh, Bobby...
Whoa, Bob likes pussy.
Who am I?
Who am I?
Bob... loves... lady cock.
What the fuck?
Oh, no...
Nearly Legal.
Nearly Legal.
Fuck, look.
Oh, fuck.
All right, freeze, boys!
Party's over.
Hands on your head.
Let's go, right now.
Hands on your head.
That's it.
Looks like you screwed up royally this time, eh, Weeks, huh?
Just like the old man, huh?
Hands behind your back.
Halsted.
Your mom posted bail.
See you this morning.
Well...
Looks like no daddy coming for you, cowboy.
Breaking and entering?
Vandalism?
Your first day pass and that's what you do with it, huh?
Well, you must be really proud of yourself.
You have any idea what that little exercise just cost me?
Kyle...
Just after 11:00 this morning, an unidentified man threw himself off the Mission City dam...
It's weird.
I was scared, but...
At the same time, I felt... really alive.
What if it doesn't repeat?
You're gonna have a criminal record on top of your drug history.
That's pretty awesome, Halsted.
7:30, Halsted!
Hey, Bob?
Bob...
I hear there's been a few break-ins in the neighbourhood lately?
What the hell are you talking about?
- Nothing.
- Okay, come on, let's go.
Get your ass in gear.
- Hello.
- Well, hello.
- Again.
- Every time.
Let's go.
Bob, lookin' slick.
Morning.
Nice one, douchebag.
So, what's on the program?
Clean it up.
Right now.
You know,
I think our man, Bob, on his down time, he likes to just settle in with a little bit of Victoria gin.
Victoria gin?
Yeah, yeah, a little bit of lubrication before he kicks off his shoes, and he thumbs through his favorite magazine...
Nearly Legal!
Right, Bob?
- I knew he was a pig.
- Oh, not to worry, Logan.
- I think you're a bit too old for him now.
- Fuck you.
Well, fuck it, cowpokes, let's celebrate!
Yeah.
Yeah!
Three more!
Here!
Baby, baby, baby, baby...
- Woo!
- Are you gonna be able ...to pay for all this?
- Oh, you bet your sweet ass, girl.
All right, yeah, I'm gonna need you to settle up.
I apologize.
He hasn't gotten laid in a bit.
Avery long time.
You want to help me out with that?
Oh...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
That there male and that there female are gonna pay for me.
I have no money.
Fuck sakes...
I'm so sorry!
Okay, thanks, partner, that was great!
All right, uh, I'm gonna sing a little song to pay for some drinks.
Woo!
Yeah, that's right, pal!
And I'm gonna dedicate it to my two friends.
Y'all know who you are...
It's us!
We're his friends!
Oh, my darlin' oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin' Clementine
Let him sing!
Hey, let him sing!
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin' Clementine...
- Where did you get this from?
- What was that noise?
And?
Oh, that is...
- Mine stinks, dude.
- Milady?
- Oh, shit.
Wow.
- My friend.
- One for you.
- Oh, my G...
Are we really gonna do this?
Tell me you haven't always wanted to knock off a liquor store?
- Are these things clean?
- What?
Well, they jam if they're dirty, right?
We're not going to shoot anybody.
Okay, you know what, the only thing that my old man cares about more than his knife collection is his fucking gun collection.
So yeah, they're clean.
Let's do this, kiddies!
Oink!
Oink!
Stick your hands up!
It's a stick-up!
Let's go!
Try to touch my dick and I'll blow your fuckin' brains out!
Go!

Okay.
You think this is fuckin' funny?
Hurry up!
Get me a bag, fuck!

Hurry up!

Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Oh, my God, what the fuck?
- How much did we get?
- I don't know, man.
There's like 500 bucks here and 42 pennies.
I took it all, man.
I took it all.
Shit...
Yo, Tiko, what's up, man?
Well, if it isn't my favourite customer, man.
- Long time, no show, bro.
- Yeah, man.
Look, um...
Michelle?
Charlotte?
Tiko, what the fuck, man?
Tell me you didn't get my sister fuckin' high.
That's not all we did, G.
Hey...

- Easy!
Fuck...
Jesus...

Nobody in there wants to talk to you.
Okay, man?
So just fuck off.
- Fuck you.
- Really?
Yeah.
There's room for you.
Nice fuckin' sweatpants.
Don't worry, guys.
I know a guy that we can score from.
Welcome to my drug of choice, kiddies.
This shit always fuckin' scared me.
They say you're addicted the moment you take your first hit.

Fuck you!
All right, kiddies, let's go.
It's okay.
Woo!
Time to up the ante!
If you slip?
Bang!
Wake up in bed like it's a bad dream.
Yeah, that's assuming we have another repeat.
Hmm, if we don't...
Make sure they bury me with my boots on.
Jesus...
Hey, Mike, come on, man.
Shh...
Kyle...
You're gonna mess up my concentration.
Ah...
Who's next?
Huh?
Hey...
- What?
- What are you doing?
You're ripped out of your mind.
We still don't even know if we're gonna repeat.
We can't fuck around like this.
I'm okay.
It's okay.
Oh, who is this girl?
There you go, girl.
Rip that pole.
- Oh, one foot, one foot...
- Fuck off, Weeks!
Woo!
- I saw a smile!
- Stop it!
I won't say another word...
No!
Don't let go!
Weeks!
Weeks, help me!
No!
You're fuckin' dead!
You're fucking dead, you fuck!
Fuck you!
See you this morning!
Fuck you!
You're fucking dead!
7:30, Halsted.
You should get some hash browns before they're all gone.
Nice one, loser!
Never realized how much I loved the hash browns.
Jesus...
Yeah.
Only it took him three days to rise from the dead.
Good morning.
Okay, you died last night.
I saw you die.
What was it like?
Do you... remember anything?
I just remember right before, and then...
It's blank.
You know, I've thought about suicide before, but...
I mean, right in that moment, right before it happened,
I...
Can't believe how bad I wanted to live.
- We have to stop.
Right now.
- What?
- If today hadn't repeated...
- But it did repeat, and it looks like it's gonna keep on repeating.
Yeah, w-we're tempting fate.
We just gotta figure something out, okay?
We gotta get out of this somehow.
You've got to be fucking kidding me.
This is a fucking gift.
We can do anything we want, anything.
It's your fuckin' loss.
Don't you think it's kind of weird that all this stuff happens on the same day your dad dies?
My dad used to force himself on me.
And a-at first, I-I didn't know what to do.
I mean, I...
I didn't even know what he was doing.
And as I got older,
I would fight back, but...
Never seemed to stop it.
So, I mean, I-I don't know what...
What, I'm supposed to give him some sort of peace of mind for that?
Here we go.
- No!
- No, no, no!
Don't!
Don't!
No!
- Fuck off!
- No!
- You don't want to do this!
- Who are you?
You don't want to do this.
- Look at me.
- Let go of me!
You don't want to do this.
Please let me go, please let me go.
Please...
- It's okay...
- Please let me go...
The news said it was a man, but...
It was a girl.
Just a girl.
I know, she's, like, the same age as me.
Maybe that's what we're supposed to be doing.
You know, maybe we're supposed to be helping people.
She's still going to be there again tomorrow.
He grabbed me, and I tried, and I said stop, and he wouldn't, and I...
Okay, we'll get you another jacket.
Copy that.
We'll bring her in for an assessment.
Get all the necessary tests.
What's going on?
A girl got attacked.
- I need a description.
- I don't know what he looked like!
Do you know who did this to you?
- Don't touch me!
- Can you give me a description?
It was him.
What?
It was him!
- Hey, hey!
- Just let me go...
Don't touch me, okay?
What the hell is the matter with you Kyle, huh?
Kyle!
Stop!
Stop it!
What the fuck?
You raped her!
You fucking raped her!
I don't know what you're fucking talking about!
Don't fucking lie to me!
You raped a 15-year-old girl!
Okay, first of all, she was 16, and I'm pretty sure that she was into it.
You fucking raped her!
Tomorrow, it'll be like it never happened, Kyle!
It doesn't make it okay.
So, what about holding up the liquor store, huh?
Is that okay?
What about kidnapping the dealer, sticking a gun in his face, making him eat cow shit?
You were this close to blowing his fucking brains out, Kyle!
Now you're on some fucking guilt trip, you're gonna tell me how I can act?
I don't know why this is happening, but since it is, I'm gonna take advantage of it, okay?
And you two better stay the fuck out of my way.
Why is this happening to us?
7:30, Halsted!
Bob!
What do you want, Halsted?
It's Wednesday, right?
Last time I checked, yeah.
Nice one, loser!
I can't believe that Charlotte was hanging out with Tiko.
No, I...
- I just never thought that she was...
- She was what?
Like you?
I don't know.
Okay, so, I have a proposition for you.
I don't think I want to hear ...this proposition.
- I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
How did you steal this?
I took them from her purse like I take everything.
Hey, Charlotte...
Hey, uh...
Look, do you want to, uh... just, um...
I don't want to talk to you.
Charlotte!
Hey...
Hi.
I'm Sonia.
Um...
Look, I know you think your brother's an asshole, and you're probably right, but...
It's just, if you would just let him talk to you for a minute, you would be doing me such a favour, okay?
Because I am so tired of hearing him bitch about how shitty he's been to you, and how you'll never forgive him...
Look, we're going to go get some Chinese food.
Why don't you guys come?
Okay.
Okay.
We can fit in the truck, right?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
Come in.
What colour?
Blonde.
- You're gonna go blonde?
- Yeah.
No...
Did not know.
I mean, I love the blonde, but your hair...
I mean, it goes so well with your eyes.
It's pretty.
Yeah, well, we already bought the pack, and we're doing it this weekend, so...
Should be fun.
Oh, ho, ho!
Well, well, well...
If this just isn't too cute for prime time.
You girls want to get more fucked up than you've ever been in your squeaky little lives?
Put it away, Weeks.
What, it's okay for you to smoke meth, but it's off limits for the rest of the family, is that it?
If it isn't the friendly neighborhood dick!
Say that again, Weeks.
How'd they ever let a gutless sack of shit like you become a cop anyways?
Just keep talking.
Come on, Weeks, keep talking.
All right, you know what, that's not even remotely funny.
Look, you want to think very carefully about what you're doing right now.
Oh, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
I'm all thunk out.
- Mike...
- Shut the fuck up, Kyle.
I'm gonna give you three seconds to get your ugly fat ass outta here.
One...
Hand away from the gun, Gerald.
Hand away from the gun.
There you go, there you go.
Two...
Fucking mess with me!
Yeah, no daddy coming for you!
Fuck off!
You don't know what you're missing.
You guys okay?
Hey...
You okay?
Charlotte, you okay?
You all right?
You okay?
7:30, Halsted!
What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
Hey, everything that you're doing is gonna stay with you!
It's gonna stay with all of us!
No, Kyle!
You do not want to do this, Kyle!
Kyle!
You have to do this.
It's not gonna make any difference.
Nothing does.
You have to try.
You know, it's amazing...
The things I could justify just to score, you know?
Like, I'll take this from my mom, she'll never know it was gone, or... steal my sister's ATM card... siphon off some cash here and there.
What's a kid need with all that money, right?
Then they...
They trashed my house 'cause of the money I owed.
And...
Beat the shit out of my little sister while I was five feet away... fucking blasted out of my mind.
I couldn't let anyone touch me for the longest time.
Come on, Mike...
You haven't had anything to eat or drink all day.
Me and Sonia are worried about you, man.
Oh, you are, huh?
The two of you, the thoughtful couple.
How nice.
God, she finally got to you, huh?
Did she feed you the line...
What was it?
Uh..."I couldn't let anybody touch me for the longest time?"
It's right before she grabs your cock, right?
How was she for you?
You know, I wasn't all that impressed, myself.
The biggest challenge is to find a nice place to fuck around here.
Where'd you do it?
You didn't do it, did you?
What's the matter, buddy?
!
Look!
Mike!
Just... stop, okay?
Stop.
Let's just forget about this, okay?
Let's just forget about all this shit...
And just try again.
Let's try to figure this out.
There's got to be some kind of deeper meaning... to this.
I...
I just took a piss in my pants.
There's got to be some deeper meaning in that, don't you think?
See, look?
I'll see you this morning!
- Are you tipsy yet?
- Maybe.
Aren't you supposed to be locked up somewhere?
Charlotte, I need to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Charlotte...
Fuck off.
I just thought if I could talk to her...
If I could explain...
Maybe there's just no point in me trying to explain the shit I did.
Kyle, she'll come around.
I don't know.
Are you, uh...
Are you okay about earlier?
Yeah.
I'm very okay.
Doesn't a part of you wonder if maybe he's right?
I mean, if every good thing we do gets erased...
Every bad thing we do gets erased...
What does it really matter what we do?
I guess...
I just need for it to matter.
7:30 Halsted!
Nice one, loser!
Hey...
Bob, where's Mike?
- What?
- Sonia?
You know where they are?
I don't know, Halsted, having a smoke?
I don't know.
Drop the club.
Come on, Kyle, it's a fucking club.
Drop it.
You think you can decide how I spend my repeats?
It's only fair that I return the favour.
Take the knife.
The knife on the table, take it.
What?
Come on, Kyle.
Good.
Stand over there.
Mike, what...
Now...
Cut his throat.
- Mike, please don't do this.
- Cut his throat, or I'll put a bullet in her leg.
I kid you not, Kyle.
I will put a hole in her leg the size of a fucking grapefruit.
Do it, or I'll put a bullet in her head!
You're fucked!
That's right, get angry!
Get motherfucking feral!
Cut his fucking throat!
Welcome to the club, Kyle.
You're okay...
Come on, come on.
All right...
- We'll have fun...
- I'm okay.
Come on, what's wrong?
Come on...
No, I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Fuck!
Get the fuck up!
Get up, you fucking piece of shit.
I knew you had it in you.
I'm gonna give you three seconds to get lost.
Fuck you.
See you this morning, Kyle.
7:30, Halsted!
Do you want me to come up?
No.
I'm fine.
You're gonna die tonight.
Don't ask me how I know, but it's true.
I've thought about what I wanted to say to you so many times.
I don't hate you anymore.
I don't, but I have to move on from this.
I have to, or else nothing's gonna change...
For any of us.
What do you want?
Are you in trouble?
No, I...
They let us out for a few hours.
Can I... can I come in?
I really need to talk to Charlotte.
I-I really don't think it's a good idea.
Mom, I really need to talk to her.
Are you clean?
Yeah, Mom.
Please let me talk to her.
Okay.
Residents are reeling tonight over the death of two local police officers in what's shaping up to be a double homicide.
The suspect is described as a Caucasian male in his early 20s...
Charlotte?
What are you doing here?
I need to talk to you.
- Get the fuck out of my room.
- No.
Charlotte, no, I'm not going anywhere until you and I have talked, okay?
We've got nothing to talk about.
Who's in the car?
One of your addict friends?
Her name's Sonia.
Yeah, I met her in rehab.
I've been thinking a lot lately...
Just about...
About what I did to you and to Mom.
I don't want to hear this, Kyle.
And I can't let another day pass without telling you...
Without telling you how sorry I am.
Fine.
Are we through now?
Thing is,
Charlotte, I see you going down the same path that I did, and...
You think I'm a fuck-up like you?
No...
No, that's not what I meant.
You don't have to watch over me.
But I...
I do.
Charlotte...
Charlotte, I do, 'Cause that's what big brothers do for their little sisters.
And I know you probably don't care right now, but...
But from now on, I'm going to be there for you.
I'll be there for you when it counts, because...
I love you.
And...
And I'm gonna be your big brother.
7:30, Halsted!
Sonia!
Kyle?
Drop it.
Drop it.
Good.
Now, I could tie you up all day, Kyle, let you wallow in your own piss, but that's not much fun.
So what we're gonna do is play a little game of hide-and-seek... with a twist.
If I find you...
I'm gonna spend the rest of the day hurting you.
You've got one minute.
One minute.
You okay?
Other door.
- One...
- Come on!
...two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten...
Come on, come on...
One minute!
There!
There!
This way!
Yeah!
Woo!
Come on.
Come on...
Come on out, kiddies, I ain't got all day.
Come on out!
Come on.
Come on!
Come on...
Come on, come on...
Go!
Come on!
Go!
Are you guys having fun yet?
You know, the last rehab place I went to...
They had us act out horrible events from our past.
What do you say, Logan?
You could be nine years old again.
I could play daddy!
Or maybe Kyle could play daddy since he can't stop fucking you!
What the fuck are you doing?
Go.
Go!
Go!
Hey...
Hey, kid!
Hey, you all right?
It doesn't snow today.
What day is it?
I said, what day is it?
!
Oh, fuck...
How are you doing?
I'm fine.
I just got a tetanus shot and some stitches.
Where is he?
No one's seen him.
We need you to come with us.
Get your fucking head down on the floor!
If you two fucking move,
I will put a fucking bullet in your head, do you hear me?
I'll fucking kill you.
I will fucking kill you.
Mom?
I'm sorry.
Lieutenant, this is Kyle Halsted and Sonia Logan.
So I understand you've been brought up to speed?
Yeah.
Most important thing is you keep him calm.
Gimme the phone, come on.
Hurry up!
Hello?
I have your friend right here.
Mike?
Kyle.
Mike, man, y-you didn't know.
You thought the day was gonna repeat again, right?
You thought you had a clean slate.
You didn't know.
You think a jury's gonna fuckin' believe that?
Mike...
We can fix this.
We got into this together, right?
So we can fix it together.
You guys turned on me, man.
You should've let it go.
You should've let it run its course.
You should have had my back, Kyle!
Mike...
Please...
Don't do this, man.
Don't take it out on them.
Please, man, don't do this to Charlotte.
Mike?
- Mike!
- Okay, we're going to have to go inside.
No, no, let me try again, I can...
Listen, this kid has killed two people already.
Come with me.
Hey, hey, hey!
- No, no, Kyle, don't!
- Stand down!
Everybody, stand down!
Mike?
Kyle, you die now, you die for keeps.
Mike, I'm coming up, man.
Mike, you gotta let 'em go.
Nobody move.
Nobody fucking move!
Stay still and shut up!
Mike!
That's my sister.
That's my baby sister and I'm not gonna let you hurt her, okay?
I'm warning you, Kyle.
Stay where you are.
Mike...
It's over.
Stop.
- Just give me the gun.
- Stop.
I was never gonna make amends with my old man.
I never was, and I never will.
It doesn't matter how many days repeat!
Give me the gun.
That's the difference between you and me, right?
Mike!
Shh, shh...
It's okay, it's okay...
Shh, shh...
Shh...
Shh, it's okay.
You okay?
Yeah.
Where the doors are moaning
All day long
Where the stairs are leaning
Dusk till dawn
Where the windows
Are breathing in the light
Where the rooms are
A collection of our lives
Where the doors
Are moaning all day long
Where the stairs are leaning
Dusk till dawn
Where the windows
Are breathing in the light
Where the rooms are
A collection of our lives
This is a place
Where I don't feel alone
This is a place
That I call my home...
Get up, Weeks.
Another day in paradise.
Breakneck speed
Tying up your hands
'Cause you're landing back on your feet
You know what I mean
Vowel change
I remember when our voices used to sound the same
Now we just translate
'Cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
After what you did
Born on your feet running
Forest fires underneath your bed
But it's good to be back
Good to be back Good to be back
Spell it out
I always skip the words
'Cause all the pictures are so bright and loud
Better off than now
'Cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
After what you did
Born on your feet running
Forest fires underneath your bed
'Cause it's good to be back
Good to be back
Super fun
At the movies drunk and young
Double knots that came undone
But the big bad years are gone
Yeah the big bad years are done
And gone away
I remember when our voices used to sound the exact same
Now we just translate
'Cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
After what you did
Born on your feet running
Forest fires underneath your bed
But it's good to be back
Good to be back Good to be back
- 7:30, Halsted!
- Nice one, loser!
- How many's that?
- 92 and counting.
- We're supposed to get out today for a bit.
- Step nine, making amends.
Can't wait.
- Let's go.
Good morning.
- He hit on me yesterday.
Nice one, douche bag!
- Hey, pick that up.
- Hey!
Hey!
- Come on!
- You're dead.
- All right, tough guy.
You too.
Thank you.
There you go.
I need you to sit down.
- What are you looking at, huh?
- Fuck...
Get me out of this place, please.
- I know it isn't easy, but taking that step towards reconciliation with the people most hurt by your addictions, that's the door to recovery.
Okay, we're gonna keep working at this.
This is mandatory policy now in all rehabilitation cent res.
Each and every one of you will be participating.
You're gonna be getting a day pass every day this week, so get out there and make good use of your time.
Remember, don't rush, all right?
Every step is a good one...
- Okay, so, I have a proposition for you.
- I don't think I want to hear this--
- I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
- Okay.
- I don't know how to--
- Are you holding it?
- Yeah, I'm holding it.
- So you put it...
- Hey, Charlotte.
No, hey, Char-
- I don't want to talk to you, Kyle.
- Charlotte, come on, I'm-I'm still your brother.
- No, I don't want to talk to him...
- Well, well.
If it isn't one of our illustrious alumni.
If you and whatever drugs you're selling aren't off the school property in the next 30 seconds,
I'm going to call the police.
All third-floor staff to the nurses' station...
- Hey, Dad.
How you doing?
- What do you want?
- Are they-are they treating you all right?
What the fuck do you want, you little prick?
Huh?
I told you I never wanted to see you again.
You get out of my sight.
Ten years because of you, you fuckin' dope fiend.
You fuckin' coward!
If I see you again, I will fucking kill you!
If you come back here, I'll fucking kill you!
I swear, I'll kill you!
- Okay, so let's talk about today's adventures.
Kyle?
- Do I have to?
- Please.
I went to see my sister.
- Okay, and how did that go?
- Not very well.
- Can you elaborate?
- No.
- Kyle-
- He doesn't want to talk about it.
- Talking is the only way to move forward.
- Oh, fuck you and move forward!
Fuck this whole place!
None of this makes any fucking difference to us!
- Fuck, I hate Bob.
- He's a cock.
- He's a fuckin' idiot.
It's "make amends" day.
Good to see you.
Sorry about all that money I stole.
- Yeah, sorry for ruining your life.
Oh, wait a minute, you ruined my life.
- It's all fucking bullshit anyways.
- Speaking of which.
- Sonia...
There's a call for you.
- My dad just died.
¢Ü I wish that I had known ¢Ü
¢Ü In that first minute we met ¢Ü
¢Ü The unpayable debt ¢Ü
¢Ü That I owed you ¢Ü
¢Ü 'Cause you'd been abused by that bone that refused you ¢Ü
¢Ü And you hired me to make up for that... ¢Ü
- Just after 11 :00 this morning, an unidentified man threw himself off the Mission City dam.
Authorities believe he died on impact, but crews are still dredging the reservoir to find his body.
In Mission City...
- Fuck...
Let's go!
7:30, Halsted!
- Nice one, loser!
- It's weird.
- What?
93, right?
- Yeah, should be 93, but... 92.
- Let's go.
Good morning.
- Nice one, douche bag!
- All right, funny guy, clean it up.
- What?
- Right now.
Right now.
- Shit...
- All of it.
- Did you guys see that?
- Fuck you, Bob.
- Get back here.
- Dick.
- Hey...
Get back here!
- That was fucking weird.
- Okay, so, I have a proposition for you.
- I don't think I want to hear this proposition.
- I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
- How did you steal this?
- I took it from her purse like I take everything, okay?
- I don't know how to--
- Okay, just hold it.
- Okay, okay, I'm holding it.
- Okay, right?
- Yeah.
- Now you have to put it to your lips like you're French.
- Okay.
- Okay.
You'll never get that!
- All third-floor staff to the nurses' station...
- Pick up the fuckin' phone.
What?
Pick up the goddamn phone.
I told you I never wanted to see you again!
You get outta my sight!
10 years 'cause of you!
You fuckin' dope fiend!
You fuckin' coward!
I see you again, I will fucking kill you!
If you come back here, I'll fucking kill you!
I swear, I'll kill you!
- Well, well.
If it isn't one of our illustrious alumni.
If you and whatever drugs you're selling are not off the school property in the next 30 seconds,
I'm calling the police.
- Okay, so let's talk about today's adventures.
Kyle?
- Yeah?
- What did you do today?
- Uh...
I went to see my sister.
- And how did that go for you?
- Not very well.
- Can you elaborate on that, please?
- No.
- Halsted.
Halsted.
Kyle...
Kyle...
- What the fuck is going on?
How is this even possible?
I mean...
Wait...
The storm.
Last night, the power went out, right?
I was in the rec room and I-I touched the TV.
I got this shock.
That's the last thing I remember.
- Same thing happened with me with my light.
- Weeks?
- Who cares how it happened?
The real question is, what are we gonna do with it?
- What were you doing last night?
- What were you doing?
- I was in the shower, okay?
I got shocked, too.
- Then what?
- I don't remember.
- Me neither.
- The same thing happened to all of us.
- Fuck, I'm gonna get that call again.
- Uh, Sonia, there's a call for you.
- Exactly the same.
- You all right?
- Shouldn't we be doing something?
We just lived through the same day twice.
Are we just gonna sit here and waste it?
- Last night, on the news...
There's-there's a jumper at the dam.
Let's go.
Let's do it.
- What about curfew?
- Fuck curfew.
- Shit, we gotta stop him.
- No, it's...
It's too late.
- Couldn't sleep.
- Me neither.
At least you went to see him.
- I didn't.
- I thought you went to the hospital.
- I went to the hospital, but...
I just couldn't go into his room.
- What do you think'd happen if we just...
Stayed in here all night?
- Trouble for sure.
- Then I'm not leaving.
- Why do you think this is happening to us?
- Sorry.
- No, it's...
It's okay.
- 7:30, Halsted!
- Bob!
- What?
- What day is it?
Last time I checked, it was Wednesday.
- Look, we're gonna figure this out.
- We're not gonna figure out shit, okay?
We're gonna keep repeating the same day over and over again until we go completely out of our fucking minds.
- Okay, but, look, we each had the same shock of electricity or whatever, right?
So...
- So, what?
So maybe that's something that we do?
- Okay, you go and electrocute yourself then, sister, but I'm gonna enjoy it while I got it.
God, what is that girl's problem?
You know, if you think about it, it doesn't really matter what we do today.
Right?
I mean, I could take a piss in group.
As a matter of fact, I could just piss on Bob.
Tomorrow, it'd be like it never happened.
- Yeah.
I don't know, man.
I... just feel like we shouldn't mess with it, you know?
- What do you think we should do with it?
- I don't know.
- Pull it out and put it back.
:
What?
- The bottle of gin.
I can see it in your pants.
Pull it out and put it back!
- It's not in my pants.
- What do you call that?
Put it back!
You know what, both of you, get the hell out of my store!
Both of you, get out!
Idiots!
- Feeling better?
- Oh, starting to.
- What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
Oh, no, dude.
We'd better pray tomorrow repeats.
Fuck!
You're sick!
Sick!
Oh, Bobby...
Whoa, Bob likes pussy.
Who am I?
Who am I?
Bob... loves... lady cock.
- What the fuck?
- Oh, no...
Nearly Legal.
Nearly Legal.
Fuck, look.
Oh, fuck.
- All right, freeze, boys!
Party's over.
Hands on your head.
Let's go, right now.
Hands on your head.
That's it.
Looks like you screwed up royally this time, eh, Weeks, huh?
Just like the old man, huh?
Hands behind your back.
Halsted.
Your mom posted bail.
- See you this morning.
- Well...
Looks like no daddy coming for you, cowboy.
- Breaking and entering?
Vandalism?
Your first day pass and that's what you do with it, huh?
Well, you must be really proud of yourself.
You have any idea what that little exercise just cost me?
Kyle...
- Just after 11:00 this morning, an unidentified man threw himself off the Mission City dam--
- It's weird.
I was scared, but...
At the same time, I felt... really alive.
- What if it doesn't repeat?
You're gonna have a criminal record on top of your drug history.
That's pretty awesome, Halsted.
7:30, Halsted!
- Hey, Bob?
Bob...
I hear there's been a few break-ins in the neighbourhood lately?
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Nothing.
- Okay, come on, let's go.
Get your ass in gear.
- Hello.
- Well, hello.
Again.
- Every time.
- Let's go.
- Bob, look in' slick.
:
Morning.
:
Nice one, douche bag.
So, what's on the program?
- Clean it up.
Right now.
- You know,
I think our man, Bob, on his down time, he likes to just settle in with a little bit of Victoria gin.
- Victoria gin?
- Yeah, yeah, a little bit of lubrication before he kicks off his shoes, and he thumbs through his favorite magazine...
Nearly Legal!
Right, Bob?
- I knew he was a pig.
- Oh, not to worry, Logan.
I think you're a bit too old for him now.
- Fuck you.
- Well, fuck it, cowpokes, let's celebrate!
- Yeah.
Yeah!
- Three more!
Here!
Baby, baby, baby, baby...
- Woo!
- Are you gonna be able to pay for all this?
- Oh, you bet your sweet ass, girl.
- All right, yeah, I'm gonna need you to settle up.
- I apologize.
He hasn't gotten laid in a bit.
- A very long time.
You want to help me out with that?
- Oh...
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
That there male and that there female are gonna pay for me.
- I have no money.
- Fuck sakes...
- I'm so sorry!
- Okay, thanks, partner, that was great!
All right, uh, I'm gonna sing a little song to pay for some drinks.
- Woo!
- Yeah, that's right, pal!
And I'm gonna dedicate it to my two friends.
Y'all know who you are-
- It's us!
We're his friends!
Oh, my darlin' oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin' Clementine
- Let him sing!
Hey, let him sing!
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin' Clementine...
- Where did you get this from?
- What was that noise?
And?
- Oh, that is--
Mine stinks, dude.
- Milady?
- Oh, shit.
Wow.
- My friend.
One for you.
- Oh, my G--
Are we really gonna do this?
- Tell me you haven't always wanted to knock off a liquor store?
- Are these things clean?
- What?
- Well, they jam if they're dirty, right?
:
We're not going to shoot anybody.
Okay, you know what, the only thing that my old man cares about more than his knife collection is his fucking gun collection.
So yeah, they're clean.
Let's do this, kiddies!
Oink!
Oink!
Stick your hands up!
It's a stick-up!
Let's go!
- Try to touch my dick and I'll blow your fuckin' brains out!
Go!
- Shit...
- Open the fuckin' register!
- Okay.
- You think this is fuckin' funny?
Hurry up!
Get me a bag, fuck!
Quick!
Here...
- What the fuck?
- Shit, there's a car!
- What?
- There's a car, fuck!
Hurry up!
- Let's go!
- Hurry!

- Grab his legs.
- Jesus...
Fuck, he's heavy.
- Fuck...
- God, Tiko...
- Get on your knees.
Get on your fuckin' knees!
- Okay, okay...
We were just having some fun, man.
I didn't-I didn't-
- Shut the fuck up!
- Okay, okay, okay... :

Now take a bite.
Take a bite, Tiko...
Fuck you, man!
I didn't touch your fucking sister, man!
You're all going to fucking jail!
Fuck you!
- All right, kiddies, let's go.
- It's okay.
Woo!
- Time to up the ante!
If you slip?
Bang!
Wake up in bed like it's a bad dream.
- Yeah, that's assuming we have another repeat.
- Hmm, if we don't...
Make sure they bury me with my boots on.
- Jesus...
- Hey, Mike, come on, man.
- Shh...
Kyle...
You're gonna mess up my concentration.
Ah...
Who's next?
Huh?
- Hey...
- What?
- What are you doing?
You're ripped out of your mind.
We still don't even know if we're gonna repeat.
We can't fuck around like this.
- I'm okay.
It's okay.
- Oh, who is this girl?
There you go, girl.
Rip that pole.
Oh, one foot, one foot-
- Fuck off, Weeks!
- Woo!
I saw a smile!
- Stop it!
- I won't say another word--
No!
- Don't let go!
Weeks!
Weeks, help me!
No!
- You're fuckin' dead!
You're fucking dead, you fuck!
Fuck you!
- See you this morning!
- Fuck you!
You're fucking dead!
7:30, Halsted.
- You should get some hash browns before they're all gone.
Nice one, loser!
- Never realized how much I loved the hash browns.
- Jesus...
- Yeah.
Only it took him three days to rise from the dead.
- Good morning.
- Okay, you died last night.
I saw you die.
- What was it like?
Do you... remember anything?
- I just remember right before, and then...
It's blank.
You know, I've thought about suicide before, but...
I mean, right in that moment, right before it happened,
I...
Can't believe how bad I wanted to live.
- We have to stop.
Right now.
- What?
- If today hadn't repeated--
- But it did repeat, and it looks like it's gonna keep on repeating.
- Yeah, w-we're tempting fate.
- We just gotta figure something out, okay?
We gotta get out of this somehow.
- You've got to be fucking kidding me.
This is a fucking gift.
We can do anything we want, anything.
It's your fuckin' loss.
- Don't you think it's kind of weird that all this stuff happens on the same day your dad dies?
- My dad used to force himself on me.
And a-at first, I-I didn't know what to do.
I mean, I...
I didn't even know what he was doing.
And as I got older,
I would fight back, but...
Never seemed to stop it.
So, I mean, I-I don't know what...
What, I'm supposed to give him some sort of peace of mind for that?
- Here we go.
No!
- No, no, no!
Don't!
Don't!
No!
- Fuck off!
- No!
- You don't want to do this!
- Who are you?
- You don't want to do this.
Look at me.
- Let go of me!
- You don't want to do this.
- Please let me go, please let me go.
:
Please...
It's okay...
:
Please let me go...
- The news said it was a man, but...
It was a girl.
Just a girl.
- I know, she's, like, the same age as me.
- Maybe that's what we're supposed to be doing.
You know, maybe we're supposed to be helping people.
- She's still going to be there again tomorrow.
- He grabbed me, and I tried, and I said stop, and he wouldn't, and I...
- Okay, we'll get you another jacket.
- Copy that.
We'll bring her in for an assessment.
Get all the necessary tests.
- What's going on?
- A girl got attacked.
- I need a description.
- I don't know what he looked like!
- Do you know who did this to you?
- Don't touch me!
- Can you give me a description?
- It was him.
- What?
- It was him!
- Hey, hey!
- Just let me go...
Don't touch me, okay?
- What the hell is the matter with you Kyle, huh?
- Kyle!
Stop!
Stop it!
- What the fuck?
- You raped her!
You fucking raped her!
- I don't know what you're fucking talking about!
- Don't fucking lie to me!
You raped a 15-year-old girl!
- Okay, first of all, she was 16, and I'm pretty sure that she was into it.
- You fucking raped her!
- Tomorrow, it'll be like it never happened, Kyle!
- It doesn't make it okay.
- So, what about holding up the liquor store, huh?
Is that okay?
What about kidnapping the dealer, sticking a gun in his face, making him eat cow shit?
You were this close to blowing his fucking brains out, Kyle!
Now you're on some fucking guilt trip, you're gonna tell me how I can act?
I don't know why this is happening, but since it is, I'm gonna take advantage of it, okay?
And you two better stay the fuck out of my way.
- Why is this happening to us?
7:30, Halsted!
- Bob!
- What do you want, Halsted?
- It's Wednesday, right?
- Last time I checked, yeah.
- Nice one, loser!
- I can't believe that Charlotte was hanging out with Tiko.
No, I...
I just never thought that she was-
- She was what?
Like you?
- I don't know.
- Okay, so, I have a proposition for you.
- I don't think I want to hear this proposition.
- I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
- How did you steal this?
- I took them from her purse like I take everything.
- Hey, Charlotte...
Hey, uh...
Look, do you want to, uh... just, um-
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Charlotte!
Hey...
Hi.
I'm Sonia.
Um...
Look, I know you think your brother's an asshole, and you're probably right, but...
It's just, if you would just let him talk to you for a minute, you would be doing me such a favour, okay?
Because I am so tired of hearing him bitch about how shitty he's been to you, and how you'll never forgive him...
Look, we're going to go get some Chinese food.
Why don't you guys come?
- Okay.
- Okay.
We can fit in the truck, right?
- Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Come in.
What colour?
- Blonde.
- You're gonna go blond e?
- Yeah.
- No...
Did not know.
I mean, I love the blond e, but your hair...
I mean, it goes so well with your eyes.
It's pretty.
- Yeah, well, we already bought the pack, and we're doing it this weekend, so...
- Should be fun.
- Oh, ho, ho!
Well, well, well...
If this just isn't too cute for prime time.
You girls want to get more fucked up than you've ever been in your squeaky little lives?
- Put it away, Weeks.
- What, it's okay for you to smoke meth, but it's off limits for the rest of the family, is that it?
If it isn't the friendly neighborhood dick!
- Say that again, Weeks.
- How'd they ever let a gutless sack of shit like you become a cop anyways?
- Just keep talking.
Come on, Weeks, keep talking.
All right, you know what, that's not even remotely funny.
Look, you want to think very carefully about what you're doing right now.
- Oh, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
I'm all thunk out.
- Mike--
- Shut the fuck up, Kyle.
I'm gonna give you three seconds to get your ugly fat ass outta here.
One...
Hand away from the gun, Gerald.
Hand away from the gun.
There you go, there you go.
Two...
Fucking mess with me!
Yeah, no daddy coming for you!
Fuck off!
You don't know what you're missing.
- You guys okay?
Hey...
You okay?
Charlotte, you okay?
You all right?
You okay?
7:30, Halsted!
- What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
- Hey, everything that you're doing is gonna stay with you!
It's gonna stay with all of us!
- No, Kyle!
You do not want to do this, Kyle!
:
Kyle!
- You have to do this.
- It's not gonna make any difference.
Nothing does.
- You have to try.
You know, it's amazing...
The things I could justify just to score, you know?
Like, I'll take this from my mom, she'll never know it was gone, or... steal my sister's ATM card... siphon off some cash here and there.
What's a kid need with all that money, right?
Then they...
They trashed my house 'cause of the money I owed.
And...
Beat the shit out of my little sister while I was five feet away... fucking blasted out of my mind.
- I couldn't let anyone touch me for the longest time.
- Come on, Mike...
You haven't had anything to eat or drink all day.
Me and Sonia are worried about you, man.
- Oh, you are, huh?
The two of you, the thoughtful couple.
How nice.
God, she finally got to you, huh?
Did she feed you the line...
What was it?
Uh... "I couldn't let anybody touch me for the longest time?"
It's right before she grabs your cock, right?
How was she for you?
You know, I wasn't all that impressed, myself.
The biggest challenge is to find a nice place to fuck around here.
Where'd you do it?
You didn't do it, did you?
What's the matter, buddy?
!
- Look!
Mike!
Just... stop, okay?
Stop.
Let's just forget about this, okay?
Let's just forget about all this shit...
And just try again.
Let's try to figure this out.
There's got to be some kind of deeper meaning... to this.
- I...
I just took a piss in my pants.
There's got to be some deeper meaning in that, don't you think?
See, look?
I'll see you this morning!
- Are you tipsy yet?
- Maybe.
Aren't you supposed to be locked up somewhere?
- Charlotte, I need to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Charlotte...
- Fuck off.
- I just thought if I could talk to her...
If I could explain...
Maybe there's just no point in me trying to explain the shit I did.
- Kyle, she'll come around.
- I don't know.
Are you, uh...
Are you okay about earlier?
- Yeah.
I'm very okay.
Doesn't a part of you wonder if maybe he's right?
I mean, if every good thing we do gets erased...
Every bad thing we do gets erased...
What does it really matter what we do?
- I guess...
I just need for it to matter.
7:30 Halsted!
Nice one, loser!
- Hey...
Bob, where's Mike?
- What?
- Sonia?
You know where they are?
I don't know, Halsted, having a smoke?
I don't know.
- Drop the club.
Come on, Kyle, it's a fucking club.
Drop it.
You think you can decide how I spend my repeats?
It's only fair that I return the favour.
Take the knife.
The knife on the table, take it.
- What?
- Come on, Kyle.
Good.
Stand over there.
- Mike, what-
- Now...
Cut his throat.
- Mike, please don't do this.
- Cut his throat, or I'll put a bullet in her leg.
I kid you not, Kyle.
I will put a hole in her leg the size of a fucking grapefruit.
Do it, or I'll put a bullet in her head!
- You're fucked!
- That's right, get angry!
Get motherfucking feral!
Cut his fucking throat!
Welcome to the club, Kyle.
- You're okay...
Come on, come on.
All right...
- We'll have fun...
- I'm okay.
Come on, what's wrong?
Come on...
- No, I'm okay.
I'm okay.
- Fuck!
- Get the fuck up!
Get up, you fucking piece of shit.
- I knew you had it in you.
I'm gonna give you three seconds to get lost.
- Fuck you.
See you this morning, Kyle.
7:30, Halsted!
- Do you want me to come up?
- No.
I'm fine.
- You're gonna die tonight.
Don't ask me how I know, but it's true.
I've thought about what I wanted to say to you so many times.
I don't hate you anymore.
I don't, but I have to move on from this.
I have to, or else no thing's gonna change...
For any of us.
- What do you want?
Are you in trouble?
- No, I...
They let us out for a few hours.
Can I-can I come in?
I really need to talk to Charlotte.
- I-I really don't think it's a good idea.
- Mom, I really need to talk to her.
- Are you clean?
- Yeah, Mom.
Please let me talk to her.
- Okay.
- Residents are reeling tonight over the death of two local police officers in what's shaping up to be a double homicide.
The suspect is described as a Caucasian male in his early 20s...
- Charlotte?
- What are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.
- Get the fuck out of my room.
- No.
Charlotte, no, I'm not going anywhere until you and I have talked, okay?
- We've got nothing to talk about.
Who's in the car?
One of your addict friends?
- Her name's Sonia.
Yeah, I met her in rehab.
I've been thinking a lot lately...
Just about...
About what I did to you and to Mom.
- I don't want to hear this, Kyle.
- And I can't let another day pass without telling you...
Without telling you how sorry I am.
- Fine.
Are we through now?
- Thing is,
Charlotte, I see you going down the same path that I did, and-
- You think I'm a fuck-up like you?
- No...
No, that's not what I meant.
- You don't have to watch over me.
- But I...
I do.
Charlotte...
Charlotte, I do, 'Cause that's what big brothers do for their little sisters.
And I know you probably don't care right now, but...
But from now on, I'm going to be there for you.
I'll be there for you when it counts, because...
I love you.
And...
And I'm gonna be your big brother.
7:30, Halsted!
- Sonia!
- Kyle?
- Drop it.
Drop it.
Good.
Now, I could tie you up all day, Kyle, let you wallow in your own piss, but that's not much fun.
So what we're gonna do is play a little game of hide-and-seek... with a twist.
If I find you...
I'm gonna spend the rest of the day hurting you.
You've got one minute.
One minute.
- You okay?
- Other door.
One...
- Come on!
- ...two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten...
Come on, come on...
- One minute!
- There!
There!
This way!
Yeah!
Woo!
- Come on.
Come on...
- Come on out, kiddies, I ain't got all day.
Come on out!
- Come on.
Come on!
Come on...
Come on, come on...
Go!
Come on!
Go!
- Are you guys having fun yet?
You know, the last rehab place I went to...
They had us act out horrible events from our past.
What do you say, Logan?
You could be nine years old again.
I could play daddy!
Or maybe Kyle could play daddy since he can't stop fucking you!
What the fuck are you doing?
- Go.
Go!
Go!
- Hey...
Hey, kid!
Hey, you all right?
- It doesn't snow today.
What day is it?
I said, what day is it?
!
Oh, fuck...
- How are you doing?
- I'm fine.
I just got a tetanus shot and some stitches.
Where is he?
- No one's seen him.
- We need you to come with us.
- Get your fucking head down on the floor!
If you two fucking move,
I will put a fucking bullet in your head, do you hear me?
I'll fucking kill you.
I will fucking kill you.
- Mom?
I'm sorry.
- Lieutenant, this is Kyle Halsted and Sonia Logan.
- So I understand you've been brought up to speed?
- Yeah.
- Most important thing is you keep him calm.
Gimme the phone, come on.
Hurry up!
Hello?
- I have your friend right here.
- Mike?
- Kyle.
- Mike, man, y-you didn't know.
You thought the day was gonna repeat again, right?
You thought you had a clean slate.
You didn't know.
- You think a jury's gonna fuckin' believe that?
- Mike...
We can fix this.
We got into this together, right?
So we can fix it together.
- You guys turned on me, man.
You should've let it go.
You should've let it run its course.
You should have had my back, Kyle!
Mike...
Please...
Don't do this, man.
Don't take it out on them.
Please, man, don't do this to Charlotte.
Mike?
Mike!
- Okay, we're going to have to go inside.
- No, no, let me try again, I can--
- Listen, this kid has killed two people already.
Come with me.
Hey, hey, hey!
- No, no, Kyle, don't!
- Stand down!
Everybody, stand down!
- Mike?
- Kyle, you die now, you die for keeps.
- Mike, I'm coming up, man.
Mike, you gotta let 'em go.
- Nobody move.
Nobody fucking move!
Stay still and shut up!
- Mike!
That's my sister.
That's my baby sister and I'm not gonna let you hurt her, okay?
- I'm warning you, Kyle.
Stay where you are.
- Mike...
It's over.
- Stop.
- Just give me the gun.
- Stop.
- I was never gonna make amends with my old man.
I never was, and I never will.
It doesn't matter how many days repeat!
- Give me the gun.
- That's the difference between you and me, right?
Mike!
Shh, shh...
It's okay, it's okay...
Shh, shh...
Shh...
Shh, it's okay.
- You okay?
- Yeah.

CNST, Montreal
(pounding on door) 7:30, Halsted!
(chattering)
Nice one, loser!
How many's that?
92 and counting.
We're supposed to get out today for a bit.
Step nine, making amends.
Can't wait.
Let's go.
Good morning.
He hit on me yesterday.
(scoffing)
Nice one, douchebag!
(cackling)
Hey, pick that up.
Hey!
Hey!
- Come on!
- You're dead.
All right, tough guy.
You too.
Thank you.
There you go.
I need you to sit down.
- What are you looking at, huh?
- Fuck...
Get me out of this place, please.
I know it isn't easy, but taking that step towards reconciliation with the people most hurt by your addictions, that's the door to recovery.
Okay, we're gonna keep working at this.
This is mandatory policy now in all rehabilitation centres.
Each and every one of you will be participating.
You're gonna be getting a day pass every day this week, so get out there and make good use of your time.
Remember, don't rush, all right?
Every step is a good one... (school bell ringing)
Okay, so, I have a proposition for you.
- I don't think I want to hear this...
- I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
- Okay.
- I don't know how to...
- Are you holding it?
- Yeah, I'm holding it.
So you put it...
Hey, Charlotte.
- No, hey, Char...
- I don't want to talk to you, Kyle.
- Charlotte, come on, I'm
-I'm still your brother.
No, I don't want to talk to him...
Well, well.
If it isn't one of our illustrious alumni.
If you and whatever drugs you're selling aren't off the school property in the next 30 seconds,
I'm going to call the police.
(engine revving)
(tires screeching)
- (monitors beeping)
- All third-floor staff to the nurses' station...
Hey, Dad.
How you doing?
What do you want?
Are they... are they treating you all right?
- (impatient banging)
- What the fuck do you want, you little prick?
Huh?
(banging on glass)
I told you I never wanted to see you again.
You get out of my sight.
Ten years because of you, you fuckin' dope fiend.
You fuckin' coward!
(loud banging)
If I see you again, I will fucking kill you!
If you come back here, I'll fucking kill you!
I swear, I'll kill you!
Okay, so let's talk about today's adventures.
Kyle?
Do I have to?
Please.
- (heavy sighing)
- I went to see my sister.
- Okay, and how did that go?
- Not very well.
Can you elaborate?
No.
- Kyle...
- He doesn't want to talk about it.
Talking is the only way to move forward.
Oh, fuck you and move forward!
Fuck this whole place!
None of this makes any fucking difference to us!
(chair slamming)
Fuck, I hate Bob.
He's a cock.
He's a fuckin' idiot.
It's "make amends" day.
Good to see you.
Sorry about all that money I stole.
Yeah, sorry for ruining your life.
Oh, wait a minute, you ruined my life.
It's all fucking bullshit anyways.
Speaking of which.
Sonia...
There's a call for you.
My dad just died.
(lighter flicking)
(soft music)
I wish that I had known
In that first minute we met
The unpayable debt
That I owed you
'Cause you'd been abused by that bone that refused you
And you hired me to make up for that... (crying)
Just after 11:00 this morning, an unidentified man threw himself off the Mission City dam.
Authorities believe he died on impact, but crews are still dredging the reservoir to find his body.
In Mission City... (music intensifying) (thunder rumbling)
(bulb shattering)
Fuck...
(switch flicking)
(electricity crackling)
(humming)
- (knocking insistently)
- Let's go!
(humming)
(pounding on door) 7:30, Halsted!
Nice one, loser!
It's weird.
What?
93, right?
Yeah, should be 93, but... 92.
Let's go.
Good morning.
Nice one, douchebag!
(cackling)
All right, funny guy, clean it up.
What?
Right now.
- Right now.
- Shit...
All of it.
Did you guys see that?
- Fuck you, Bob.
- Get back here.
Dick.
Hey...
Get back here!
That was fucking weird.
(buzzer blaring)
(school bell ringing)
Okay, so, I have a proposition for you.
I don't think I want to hear this proposition.
I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
How did you steal this?
I took it from her purse like I take everything, okay?
- I don't know how to...
- Okay, just hold it.
Okay, okay, I'm holding it.
- Okay, right?
- Yeah.
Now you have to put it to your lips like you're French.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- (giggling)
- You'll never get that!
(monitors beeping)
All third-floor staff to the nurses' station...
Pick up the fuckin' phone.
What?
Pick up the goddamn phone.
(banging impatiently)
I told you I never wanted to see you again!
You get outta my sight!
10 years 'cause of you!
You fuckin' dope fiend!
(loud banging)
You fuckin' coward!
I see you again, I will fucking kill you!
If you come back here, I'll fucking kill you!
I swear, I'll kill you!
Well, well.
If it isn't one of our illustrious alumni.
If you and whatever drugs you're selling are not off the school property in the next 30 seconds,
I'm calling the police.
(engine starting)
(security buzzer blaring)
Okay, so let's talk about today's adventures.
Kyle?
Yeah?
What did you do today?
Uh...
I went to see my sister.
(laughing)
And how did that go for you?
Not very well.
(laughing)
Can you elaborate on that, please?
No.
Halsted.
Halsted.
Kyle... (voice echoing dreamily):
Kyle...
What the fuck is going on?
How is this even possible?
I mean...
Wait...
The storm.
Last night, the power went out, right?
I was in the rec room and I-I touched the TV.
I got this shock.
That's the last thing I remember.
Same thing happened with me with my light.
- Weeks?
- Who cares how it happened?
The real question is, what are we gonna do with it?
What were you doing last night?
- What were you doing?
- I was in the shower, okay?
I got shocked, too.
Then what?
I don't remember.
Me neither.
The same thing happened to all of us.
Fuck, I'm gonna get that call again.
(door opening)
Uh, Sonia, there's a call for you.
Exactly the same.
You all right?
Shouldn't we be doing something?
We just lived through the same day twice.
Are we just gonna sit here and waste it?
Last night, on the news...
There's-there's a jumper at the dam.
Let's go.
Let's do it.
- What about curfew?
- Fuck curfew.
- Shit, we gotta stop him.
- No, it's...
It's too late.
(Sonia sighs.)
(thunder rumbling)
Couldn't sleep.
Me neither.
At least you went to see him.
I didn't.
I thought you went to the hospital.
I went to the hospital, but...
I just couldn't go into his room.
What do you think 'd happen if we just...
Stayed in here all night?
Trouble for sure.
Then I'm not leaving.
(chuckling)
Why do you think this is happening to us?
- Sorry.
- No, it's...
It's okay.
7:30, Halsted!
Bob!
What?
What day is it?
Last time I checked, it was Wednesday.
Look, we're gonna figure this out.
We're not gonna figure out shit, okay?
We're gonna keep repeating the same day over and over again until we go completely out of our fucking minds.
Okay, but, look, we each had the same shock of electricity or whatever, right?
So...
So, what?
So maybe that's something that we do?
Okay, you go and electrocute yourself then, sister, but I'm gonna enjoy it while I got it.
(quietly):
God, what is that girl's problem?
You know, if you think about it, it doesn't really matter what we do today.
Right?
I mean, I could take a piss in group.
As a matter of fact, I could just piss on Bob.
Tomorrow, it'd be like it never happened.
Yeah.
I don't know, man.
I... just feel like we shouldn't mess with it, you know?
What do you think we should do with it?
I don't know.
(laughing)
Pull it out and put it back.
- (laughing):
What?
- The bottle of gin.
I can see it in your pants.
- Pull it out and put it back!
- It's not in my pants.
What do you call that?
Put it back!
You know what, both of you, get the hell out of my store!
Both of you, get out!
Idiots!
(laughing)
- Feeling better?
- Oh, starting to.
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
Oh, no, dude.
We'd better pray tomorrow repeats.
(engine roaring to life) (laughing)
Fuck!
(whooping in excitement)
(laughing)
(tires squealing)
You're sick!
Sick!
Oh, Bobby... (heavy metal music)
Whoa, Bob likes pussy.
Who am I?
Who am I?
(humming)
Bob... loves... lady cock.
(laughing)
What the fuck?
Oh, no...
Nearly Legal.
Nearly Legal.
Fuck, look.
(laughing) Oh, fuck.
All right, freeze, boys!
Party's over.
Hands on your head.
Let's go, right now.
Hands on your head.
That's it.
Looks like you screwed up royally this time, eh, Weeks, huh?
Just like the old man, huh?
Hands behind your back.
(laughing)
Halsted.
Your mom posted bail.
See you this morning.
Well...
Looks like no daddy coming for you, cowboy.
Breaking and entering?
Vandalism?
Your first day pass and that's what you do with it, huh?
Well, you must be really proud of yourself.
You have any idea what that little exercise just cost me?
Kyle...
Just after 11:00 this morning, an unidentified man threw himself off the Mission City dam...
(heavy sighing)
It's weird.
I was scared, but...
At the same time, I felt... really alive.
What if it doesn't repeat?
You're gonna have a criminal record on top of your drug history.
That's pretty awesome, Halsted.
- (pounding on door) - 7:30, Halsted!
Hey, Bob?
Bob...
I hear there's been a few break-ins in the neighbourhood lately?
What the hell are you talking about?
- Nothing.
- Okay, come on, let's go.
Get your ass in gear.
(chattering)
(chattering)
- Hello.
- Well, hello.
(chuckling)
- Again.
- Every time.
Let's go.
Bob, lookin' slick.
(awkwardly):
Morning. (laughing)
(quietly):
Nice one, douchebag.
(tray clattering)
(laughing)
So, what's on the program?
Clean it up.
Right now.
You know,
I think our man, Bob, on his down time, he likes to just settle in with a little bit of Victoria gin.
Victoria gin?
Yeah, yeah, a little bit of lubrication before he kicks off his shoes, and he thumbs through his favorite magazine... (chanting together):
Nearly Legal!
Right, Bob?
(laughter)
- I knew he was a pig.
- Oh, not to worry, Logan.
- I think you're a bit too old for him now.
- Fuck you.
(laughing)
Well, fuck it, cowpokes, let's celebrate!
Yeah.
(country music)
- (screaming)
- Yeah!
Three more!
Here!
Baby, baby, baby, baby...
- Woo!
- Are you gonna be able ...to pay for all this?
- Oh, you bet your sweet ass, girl.
All right, yeah, I'm gonna need you to settle up.
I apologize.
He hasn't gotten laid in a bit.
Avery long time.
You want to help me out with that?
Oh...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
That there male and that there female are gonna pay for me.
I have no money.
Fuck sakes...
I'm so sorry!
Okay, thanks, partner, that was great!
All right, uh, I'm gonna sing a little song to pay for some drinks.
Woo!
Yeah, that's right, pal!
And I'm gonna dedicate it to my two friends.
Y'all know who you are...
It's us!
We're his friends!
Oh, my darlin' oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin' Clementine
Let him sing!
Hey, let him sing!
(car horns blaring) (laughing hysterically)
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin' Clementine... (laughing)
(Weeks making goofy noises.)
- Where did you get this from?
- What was that noise?
(laughing)
And?
(oinking)
Oh, that is...
- Mine stinks, dude.
- Milady?
- Oh, shit.
Wow.
- My friend.
- One for you.
- Oh, my G...
Are we really gonna do this?
Tell me you haven't always wanted to knock off a liquor store?
- Are these things clean?
- What?
Well, they jam if they're dirty, right?
(laughing):
We're not going to shoot anybody.
Okay, you know what, the only thing that my old man cares about more than his knife collection is his fucking gun collection.
So yeah, they're clean.
Let's do this, kiddies!
Oink!
Oink!
(rock music)
Stick your hands up!
It's a stick-up!
Let's go!
Try to touch my dick and I'll blow your fuckin' brains out!
Go!
(laughing)
- Shit...
- Open the fuckin' register!
Okay.
You think this is fuckin' funny?
Hurry up!
Get me a bag, fuck!
- Quick!
Here...
- What the fuck?
(laughing)
- Shit, there's a car!
- What?
- There's a car, fuck!
Hurry up!
- Let's go!
- Hurry!
- Let's go, come on!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
(laughing)
(song playing)
(laughing) (indistinct conversation)
Oh, my God, what the fuck?
(laughing in triumph)
- How much did we get?
- I don't know, man.
There's like 500 bucks here and 42 pennies.
(laughing) I took it all, man.
I took it all.
(wailing sirens approaching)
Shit... (laughing)
(knocking)
(knocking on door)
Yo, Tiko, what's up, man?
Well, if it isn't my favourite customer, man.
- Long time, no show, bro.
- Yeah, man.
Look, um...
Michelle?
Charlotte?
Tiko, what the fuck, man?
Tell me you didn't get my sister fuckin' high.
That's not all we did, G.
Hey...
- Charlotte!
- Easy!
Fuck...
Jesus...
We good?
Nobody in there wants to talk to you.
Okay, man?
So just fuck off.
- Fuck you.
- Really?
Yeah.
There's room for you.
Nice fuckin' sweatpants.
(laughing)
Don't worry, guys.
I know a guy that we can score from.
Welcome to my drug of choice, kiddies.
This shit always fuckin' scared me.
They say you're addicted the moment you take your first hit.
Only today...
You get to be unaddicted again.
(sighing)
Here it comes.
Go, go, go, go, go.
(exhaling shakily)
(gunfire) ...ain't gonna cure you
Honey time's just gonna hit on you
You got to
You got to go steal ahead
You got to go steal ahead
You got to You got to go steal ahead...
Fuck me.
You've got to You got to go steal ahead
Uh-huh...
You know, your sister's little friend, she's pretty hot.
Yeah, she's also 15 fucking years old, dude.
(laughing)
Nearly Legal!
(laughing)
I mean, she is fuckin' hot, though.
Time's just gonna hit on you
I said
Six kinds of glue
Won't hold you
Won't hold you
Oh my oh
Oh my you've got to You got to you got to you got to... (knocking insistently)
Go steal ahead Go steal ahead... (pounding)
Hold the fuck on!
What?
(taser crackling)
(giggling)
Grab his legs.
(giggling)
- Jesus...
Fuck, he's heavy.
- Fuck... (groaning with effort)
God, Tiko...
Get on your knees.
Get on your fuckin' knees!
Okay, okay...
We were just having some fun, man.
- I didn't-I didn't...
- Shut the fuck up!
Okay, okay, okay... (whispering):
Come on, man.
Pick that up.
What?
(gunshot)
Pick that up.
- No, man.
Fuck you, man!
- Pick that up, you fuck!
Fuck...
I didn't touch your fucking sister, man!
Pick it fucking up!
Don't make me fucking do this, man.
Don't make me do it, man...
Fuck.
Don't fucking cry, just fuckin' pick it up.
(sobbing):
No... (whimpering)
Mm-hmm.
Now take a bite.
(sniveling)
Take a bite, Tiko... (sobbing)
(gagging and retching)
- (sobbing)
- Fuck you, man!
I didn't touch your fucking sister, man!
(sobbing)
You're all going to fucking jail!
Fuck you!
(sobbing)
(giggling)
All right, kiddies, let's go.
It's okay.
Woo!
(whooping with excitement)
Time to up the ante!
If you slip?
Bang!
Wake up in bed like it's a bad dream.
Yeah, that's assuming we have another repeat.
Hmm, if we don't...
Make sure they bury me with my boots on.
(gasping)
Jesus... (laughing)
Hey, Mike, come on, man.
Shh...
Kyle...
You're gonna mess up my concentration.
(laughing)
(water roaring)
(laughing)
Ah...
Who's next?
Huh?
Hey...
- What?
- What are you doing?
You're ripped out of your mind.
We still don't even know if we're gonna repeat.
We can't fuck around like this.
I'm okay.
It's okay.
Oh, who is this girl?
There you go, girl.
Rip that pole.
(laughing)
- Oh, one foot, one foot...
- Fuck off, Weeks!
(laughing)
(laughing)
Woo!
- I saw a smile!
- Stop it!
(laughing)
I won't say another word...
- (screaming)
- No!
Don't let go!
Weeks!
Weeks, help me!
- (laughing)
- No!
(screaming)
(laughing)
You're fuckin' dead!
(laughing) You're fucking dead, you fuck!
Fuck you!
See you this morning!
Fuck you!
(laughing) You're fucking dead!
- (pounding on door) - 7:30, Halsted.
(chattering and laughter)
You should get some hash browns before they're all gone.
- (tray crashing)
- Nice one, loser!
Never realized how much I loved the hash browns.
Jesus...
Yeah.
Only it took him three days to rise from the dead.
Good morning.
(tray clattering)
Okay, you died last night.
I saw you die.
What was it like?
Do you... remember anything?
I just remember right before, and then...
It's blank.
You know, I've thought about suicide before, but...
I mean, right in that moment, right before it happened,
I...
Can't believe how bad I wanted to live.
We have to stop.
Right now.
- What?
- If today hadn't repeated...
- But it did repeat, and it looks like it's gonna keep on repeating.
Yeah, w-we're tempting fate.
We just gotta figure something out, okay?
We gotta get out of this somehow.
You've got to be fucking kidding me.
This is a fucking gift.
We can do anything we want, anything.
It's your fuckin' loss.
Don't you think it's kind of weird that all this stuff happens on the same day your dad dies?
My dad used to force himself on me.
And a-at first, I-I didn't know what to do.
I mean, I...
I didn't even know what he was doing.
And as I got older,
I would fight back, but...
Never seemed to stop it.
So, I mean, I-I don't know what...
What, I'm supposed to give him some sort of peace of mind for that?
Here we go.
- No!
- No, no, no!
Don't!
Don't!
No!
- Fuck off!
- No!
- You don't want to do this!
- Who are you?
You don't want to do this.
- Look at me.
- Let go of me!
You don't want to do this.
Please let me go, please let me go.
(sobbing):
Please...
- It's okay...
- (sobbing):
Please let me go...
The news said it was a man, but...
It was a girl.
Just a girl.
I know, she's, like, the same age as me.
Maybe that's what we're supposed to be doing.
You know, maybe we're supposed to be helping people.
She's still going to be there again tomorrow.
He grabbed me, and I tried, and I said stop, and he wouldn't, and I...
Okay, we'll get you another jacket.
Copy that.
We'll bring her in for an assessment.
Get all the necessary tests.
What's going on?
A girl got attacked.
(sobbing)
- I need a description.
- I don't know what he looked like!
Do you know who did this to you?
- Don't touch me!
- Can you give me a description?
It was him.
What?
It was him!
- Hey, hey!
- Just let me go...
Don't touch me, okay?
What the hell is the matter with you Kyle, huh?
Kyle!
Stop!
Stop it!
What the fuck?
You raped her!
You fucking raped her!
I don't know what you're fucking talking about!
Don't fucking lie to me!
You raped a 15-year-old girl!
Okay, first of all, she was 16, and I'm pretty sure that she was into it.
You fucking raped her!
Tomorrow, it'll be like it never happened, Kyle!
It doesn't make it okay.
So, what about holding up the liquor store, huh?
Is that okay?
What about kidnapping the dealer, sticking a gun in his face, making him eat cow shit?
You were this close to blowing his fucking brains out, Kyle!
Now you're on some fucking guilt trip, you're gonna tell me how I can act?
I don't know why this is happening, but since it is, I'm gonna take advantage of it, okay?
And you two better stay the fuck out of my way.
(tires screeching)
Why is this happening to us?
- (pounding on door) - 7:30, Halsted!
Bob!
What do you want, Halsted?
It's Wednesday, right?
Last time I checked, yeah.
(chair leg clattering)
Nice one, loser!
I can't believe that Charlotte was hanging out with Tiko.
No, I...
- I just never thought that she was...
- She was what?
Like you?
I don't know.
(school bell ringing)
Okay, so, I have a proposition for you.
I don't think I want to hear ...this proposition.
- I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
How did you steal this?
I took them from her purse like I take everything.
Hey, Charlotte...
Hey, uh...
Look, do you want to, uh... just, um...
I don't want to talk to you.
Charlotte!
Hey...
Hi.
I'm Sonia.
Um...
Look, I know you think your brother's an asshole, and you're probably right, but...
It's just, if you would just let him talk to you for a minute, you would be doing me such a favour, okay?
Because I am so tired of hearing him bitch about how shitty he's been to you, and how you'll never forgive him...
Look, we're going to go get some Chinese food.
Why don't you guys come?
Okay.
Okay.
We can fit in the truck, right?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
Come in.
What colour?
Blonde.
- You're gonna go blonde?
- Yeah.
No...
Did not know.
I mean, I love the blonde, but your hair...
I mean, it goes so well with your eyes.
It's pretty.
Yeah, well, we already bought the pack, and we're doing it this weekend, so...
Should be fun.
(door chimes jingling)
Oh, ho, ho!
Well, well, well...
If this just isn't too cute for prime time.
You girls want to get more fucked up than you've ever been in your squeaky little lives?
Put it away, Weeks.
What, it's okay for you to smoke meth, but it's off limits for the rest of the family, is that it?
If it isn't the friendly neighborhood dick!
Say that again, Weeks.
How'd they ever let a gutless sack of shit like you become a cop anyways?
Just keep talking.
Come on, Weeks, keep talking.
All right, you know what, that's not even remotely funny.
Look, you want to think very carefully about what you're doing right now.
Oh, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
I'm all thunk out.
- Mike...
- Shut the fuck up, Kyle.
I'm gonna give you three seconds to get your ugly fat ass outta here.
One...
Hand away from the gun, Gerald.
Hand away from the gun.
There you go, there you go.
Two... (door chimes jingling)
(gunfire)
(people screaming)
Fucking mess with me!
Yeah, no daddy coming for you!
Fuck off!
You don't know what you're missing.
You guys okay?
Hey...
You okay?
Charlotte, you okay?
You all right?
You okay?
(people sobbing and whimpering in shock)
- (pounding on door) - 7:30, Halsted!
What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
Hey, everything that you're doing is gonna stay with you!
It's gonna stay with all of us!
No, Kyle!
You do not want to do this, Kyle!
(muffled shouting)
(garbled):
Kyle!
(screaming in frustration)
You have to do this.
It's not gonna make any difference.
Nothing does.
You have to try.
You know, it's amazing...
The things I could justify just to score, you know?
Like, I'll take this from my mom, she'll never know it was gone, or... steal my sister's ATM card... siphon off some cash here and there.
What's a kid need with all that money, right?
Then they...
They trashed my house 'cause of the money I owed.
And...
Beat the shit out of my little sister while I was five feet away... fucking blasted out of my mind.
I couldn't let anyone touch me for the longest time.
Come on, Mike...
You haven't had anything to eat or drink all day.
Me and Sonia are worried about you, man.
Oh, you are, huh?
The two of you, the thoughtful couple.
How nice.
God, she finally got to you, huh?
Did she feed you the line...
What was it?
Uh..."I couldn't let anybody touch me for the longest time?"
It's right before she grabs your cock, right?
How was she for you?
You know, I wasn't all that impressed, myself.
The biggest challenge is to find a nice place to fuck around here.
Where'd you do it?
You didn't do it, did you?
What's the matter, buddy?
!
Look!
Mike!
Just... stop, okay?
Stop.
Let's just forget about this, okay?
Let's just forget about all this shit...
And just try again.
Let's try to figure this out.
There's got to be some kind of deeper meaning... to this.
(laughing)
I...
I just took a piss in my pants.
There's got to be some deeper meaning in that, don't you think?
(laughing)
See, look?
(laughing)
I'll see you this morning!
- Are you tipsy yet?
- Maybe.
(girls giggling)
Aren't you supposed to be locked up somewhere?
Charlotte, I need to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Charlotte...
Fuck off.
I just thought if I could talk to her...
If I could explain...
Maybe there's just no point in me trying to explain the shit I did.
Kyle, she'll come around.
I don't know.
Are you, uh...
Are you okay about earlier?
Yeah.
I'm very okay.
Doesn't a part of you wonder if maybe he's right?
I mean, if every good thing we do gets erased...
Every bad thing we do gets erased...
What does it really matter what we do?
I guess...
I just need for it to matter.
- (pounding on door) - 7:30 Halsted!
- (tray clattering)
- Nice one, loser!
Hey...
Bob, where's Mike?
- What?
- Sonia?
You know where they are?
I don't know, Halsted, having a smoke?
I don't know.
(whimpering in fear)
Drop the club.
Come on, Kyle, it's a fucking club.
Drop it.
You think you can decide how I spend my repeats?
It's only fair that I return the favour.
Take the knife.
(crying)
The knife on the table, take it.
What?
Come on, Kyle.
Good.
Stand over there.
Mike, what...
Now...
Cut his throat.
(whimpering and crying)
- Mike, please don't do this.
- Cut his throat, or I'll put a bullet in her leg.
I kid you not, Kyle.
I will put a hole in her leg the size of a fucking grapefruit.
(gunshot) (screaming)
Do it, or I'll put a bullet in her head!
You're fucked!
That's right, get angry!
Get motherfucking feral!
Cut his fucking throat!
(muffled crying)
(strangled choking)
Welcome to the club, Kyle.
You're okay... (moaning in pain)
Come on, come on.
(whimpering)
All right...
- We'll have fun...
- I'm okay.
Come on, what's wrong?
Come on...
No, I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Fuck!
Get the fuck up!
Get up, you fucking piece of shit.
I knew you had it in you.
I'm gonna give you three seconds to get lost.
Fuck you.
(gunshot, girl screaming)
(voice echoing):
See you this morning, Kyle.
- (pounding on door) - 7:30, Halsted!
(panting in terror)
Do you want me to come up?
No.
I'm fine.
You're gonna die tonight.
Don't ask me how I know, but it's true.
I've thought about what I wanted to say to you so many times.
I don't hate you anymore.
I don't, but I have to move on from this.
I have to, or else nothing's gonna change...
For any of us.
(doorbell ringing)
What do you want?
Are you in trouble?
No, I...
They let us out for a few hours.
Can l-can I come in?
I really need to talk to Charlotte.
I-I really don't think it's a good idea.
Mom, I really need to talk to her.
Are you clean?
Yeah, Mom.
Please let me talk to her.
Okay.
Residents are reeling tonight over the death of two local police officers in what's shaping up to be a double homicide.
The suspect is described as a Caucasian male in his early 20s...
Charlotte?
What are you doing here?
I need to talk to you.
- Get the fuck out of my room.
- No.
Charlotte, no, I'm not going anywhere until you and I have talked, okay?
We've got nothing to talk about.
Who's in the car?
One of your addict friends?
Her name's Sonia.
Yeah, I met her in rehab.
I've been thinking a lot lately...
Just about...
About what I did to you and to Mom.
I don't want to hear this, Kyle.
And I can't let another day pass without telling you...
Without telling you how sorry I am.
Fine.
Are we through now?
Thing is,
Charlotte, I see you going down the same path that I did, and...
You think I'm a fuck-up like you?
No...
No, that's not what I meant.
You don't have to watch over me.
But I...
I do.
Charlotte...
Charlotte, I do, 'Cause that's what big brothers do for their little sisters.
And I know you probably don't care right now, but...
But from now on, I'm going to be there for you.
I'll be there for you when it counts, because...
I love you.
And...
And I'm gonna be your big brother.
- (pounding on door) - 7:30, Halsted!
Sonia!
Kyle?
Drop it.
Drop it.
Good. (whimpering)
Now, I could tie you up all day, Kyle, let you wallow in your own piss, but that's not much fun.
So what we're gonna do is play a little game of hide-and-seek... with a twist.
If I find you...
I'm gonna spend the rest of the day hurting you.
(crying)
(whispering):
You've got one minute.
One minute.
You okay?
(gun cocking)
Other door.
- One...
- Come on!
...two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten...

(gunshot) (gunshot ricocheting)
Come on.
Come on!
Come on...
Come on, come on... (gunshot) (glass shattering)
(screaming)
Go!
Come on!
Go!
Are you guys having fun yet?
(gun cocking) You know, the last rehab place I went to...
They had us act out horrible events from our past.
What do you say, Logan?
You could be nine years old again.
I could play daddy!
Or maybe Kyle could play daddy since he can't stop fucking you!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- (gunshot, man groaning)
Go.
Go!
(gunfire)
(screaming)
Go!
(panting)
(forklift beeping)
Hey...
Hey, kid!
(gun cocking)
Hey, you all right?
(gunshot, man groaning)
It doesn't snow today.
What day is it?
I said, what day is it?
!
(groaning)
(heavy breathing)
Oh, fuck...
How are you doing?
I'm fine.
I just got a tetanus shot and some stitches.
Where is he?
No one's seen him.
We need you to come with us.
(siren wailing)
Get your fucking head down on the floor!
If you two fucking move,
I will put a fucking bullet in your head, do you hear me?
I'll fucking kill you.
I will fucking kill you.
Mom?
I'm sorry.
Lieutenant, this is Kyle Halsted and Sonia Logan.
So I understand you've been brought up to speed?
Yeah.
Most important thing is you keep him calm.
(speed dial)
- (telephone ringing)
- Gimme the phone, come on.
Hurry up!
Hello?
I have your friend right here.
Mike?
Kyle.
Mike, man, y-you didn't know.
You thought the day was gonna repeat again, right?
You thought you had a clean slate.
You didn't know.
You think a jury's gonna fuckin' believe that?
(Charlotte sobbing)
Mike...
We can fix this.
We got into this together, right?
So we can fix it together.
You guys turned on me, man.
You should've let it go.
You should've let it run its course.
You should have had my back, Kyle!
Mike...
Please...
Don't do this, man.
Don't take it out on them.
Please, man, don't do this to Charlotte.
(screaming and whimpering)
Mike?
- Mike!
- Okay, we're going to have to go inside.
No, no, let me try again, I can...
Listen, this kid has killed two people already.
Come with me.
Hey, hey, hey!
- No, no, Kyle, don't!
- Stand down!
Everybody, stand down!
Mike?
Kyle, you die now, you die for keeps.
Mike, I'm coming up, man.
(hostages crying)
Mike, you gotta let 'em go.
(crying)
Nobody move.
Nobody fucking move!
Stay still and shut up!
Mike!
That's my sister.
That's my baby sister and I'm not gonna let you hurt her, okay?
(crying)
I'm warning you, Kyle.
Stay where you are.
Mike...
It's over.
Stop.
- Just give me the gun.
- Stop.
(gunshot, Kyle groaning)
(crying)
I was never gonna make amends with my old man.
I never was, and I never will.
It doesn't matter how many days repeat!
Give me the gun.
That's the difference between you and me, right?
Mike!
(gunshot, girls screaming)
(sobbing)
Shh, shh...
It's okay, it's okay...
Shh, shh...
Shh...
Shh, it's okay.
You okay?
Yeah.
Where the doors are moaning
All day long
Where the stairs are leaning
Dusk till dawn
Where the windows
Are breathing in the light
Where the rooms are
A collection of our lives
Where the doors
Are moaning all day long
Where the stairs are leaning
Dusk till dawn
Where the windows
Are breathing in the light
Where the rooms are
A collection of our lives
(siren wailing)
This is a place
Where I don't feel alone
This is a place
That I call my home...
(pounding on door)
Get up, Weeks.
Another day in paradise.
Breakneck speed
Tying up your hands
'Cause you're landing back on your feet
You know what I mean
Vowel change
I remember when our voices used to sound the same
Now we just translate
'Cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
After what you did
Born on your feet running
Forest fires underneath your bed
But it's good to be back
Good to be back Good to be back
Spell it out
I always skip the words
'Cause all the pictures are so bright and loud
Better off than now
'Cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
After what you did
Born on your feet running
Forest fires underneath your bed
'Cause it's good to be back
Good to be back
Super fun
At the movies drunk and young
Double knots that came undone
But the big bad years are gone
Yeah the big bad years are done
And gone away
I remember when our voices used to sound the exact same
Now we just translate
'Cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
After what you did
Born on your feet running
Forest fires underneath your bed
But it's good to be back
Good to be back Good to be back

'Cause you'd been abused by that bone that refused you
And you hired me to make upfor that... (cying)

At least you went to see him.

- What do you think'd happen ifwe just...
Stayed in here all night?

(chuckling)
- Why do you think this is happening to us?
- Sory.
- No, it's...
It's okay.
- T:30, Halsted!
- Bob!
- What?
- What day is it?
Last time I checked, it was Wednesday.
- Look, we're gonna figure this out.
- We're not gonna figure out shit, okay?
We're gonna keep repeating the same day over and over again until we go completely out of our fucking minds.
- Okay, but, look, we each had the same shock of electricity or whatever, right?
So...
- So, what?
So maybe that's something that we do?
- Okay, you go and electrocute yourself then, sister, but I'm gonna enjoy it while I got it.
(quietly):
God, what is that girl's problem?
You know, ifyou think about it, it doesn't really matterwhat we do today.
Right?
I mean, I could take a piss in group.
As a matter of fact, I could just piss on Bob.
Tomorrow, it'd be like it never happened.
-Yeah. I don't know, man.
I... just feel like we shouldn't mess with it, you know?
- What do you think we should do with it?
- l don't know.
(laughing)
- Pull it out and put it back.
(laughing):
What?

I can see it in your pants.
Pull it out and put it back!

(tray crashing)
- Nice one, loser!
- Never realized how much I loved the hashbrowns.
- Jesus...
- Yeah.
Only it took him three days to rise from the dead.
- Good morning.
(tray clattering)
- Okay, you died last night.
I saw you die.
- What was it like?
Do you... remember anything?
- l just remember right before, and then... lt's blank.
You know, I've thought about suicide before, but... I mean, right in that moment, right before it happened, I...
Can't believe how bad I wanted to live.
- We have to stop.
Right now.
- What?
- If today hadn't repeated--
- But it did repeat, and it looks like it's gonna keep on repeating.
- Yeah, w-we're tempting fate.
- Wejust gotta figure something out, okay?
We gotta get out of this somehow.
- You've got to be fucking kidding me.
This is a fucking gift.
We can do anything we want, anything.
It's your fuckin' loss.
- Don't you think it's kind ofweird that all this stum happens on the same day your dad dies?
- My dad used to force himself on me.
And a-at first, l-l didn't know what to do.
I mean, I... I didn't even know what he was doing.
And as I got older, I would fight back, but...
Never seemed to stop it.
So, I mean, l-l don't know what...
What, I'm supposed to give him some sort of peace of mind for that?
- Here we go.
No!
- No, no, no!
Don't!
Don't!
No!
- Fuck om!
- No!
- You don't want to do this!
- Who are you?
- You don't want to do this.
Look at me.
- Let go of me!
- You don't want to do this.
- Please let me go, please let me go.
(sobbing):
Please...
- It's okay...
(sobbing):
Please let me go...
- The news said it was a man, but... lt was a girl.
Just a girl.
- l know, she's, like, the same age as me.
- Maybe that's what we're supposed to be doing.
You know, maybe we're supposed to be helping people.
- She's still going to be there again tomorrow.
- He grabbed me, and I tried, and I said stop, and he wouldn't, and I...
- Okay, we'll get you anotherjacket.
- Copy that.
We'll bring her in for an assessment.
Get all the necessay tests.
- What's going on?
-A girl got attacked.
(sobbing)
- l need a description.
- l don't know what he looked like!
- Do you know who did this to you?
- Don't touch me!
- Can you give me a description?
- It was him.
- What?
- It was him!
- Hey, hey!

Don't touch me, okay?

- Kyle!
Stop!
Stop it!
- What the fuck?
-You raped her!
You fucking raped her!
- l don't know what you're fucking talking about!
- Don't fucking lie to me!
You raped a 15-year-old girl!
- Okay, fint of all, she was 16, and I'm pretty sure that she was into it.
-You fucking raped her!
- Tomorrow, it'll be like it never happened, Kyle!
- It doesn't make it okay.
- So, what about holding up the liquor store, huh?
is that okay?
What about kidnapping the dealer, sticking a gun in his face, making him eat cow shit?
You were this close to blowing his fucking brains out, Kyle!
Now you're on some fucking guilt trip, you're gonna tell me how I can act?
I don't know why this is happening, but since it is, I'm gonna take advantage of it, okay?
And you two better stay the fuck out of my way.
(tires screeching)
- Why is this happening to us?
(pounding on door)
- T:30, Halsted!

No, I... I just never thought that she was-
- She was what?
Like you?

(school bell ringing)
- Okay, so, I have a proposition foryou.
- l don't think I want to hear this proposition.

- Charlotte!
Hey...
Hi. I'm Sonia.
Um...
Look, I know you think your brothers an asshole, and you're probably right, but... lt'sjust, ifyou would just let him talk to you for a minute, you would be doing me such a favour, okay?
Because I am so tired of hearing him bitch about how shitty he's been to you, and how you'll never forgive him...
Look, we're going to go get some Chinese food.
Why don't you guys come?
- Okay.

We can fit in the truck, right?

It's pretty.
-Yeah, well, we already bought the pack, and we're doing it this weekend, so...
- Should be fun.
(door chimesjingling)
- Oh, ho, ho!
Well, well, well... lf thisjust isn't too cute for prime time.
You girls want to get more fucked up than you've ever been in your squeam little lives?
- Put it away, Weeks.
- What, it's okay foryou to smoke meth, but it's omlimits for the rest of the family, is that it?
If it isn't the friendly neighbomood dick!
- Say that again, Weeks.
- How'd they ever let a gutless sack of shit like you become a cop anyways?
- Just keep talking.
Come on, Weeks, keep talking.
All right, you know what, that's not even remotely funny.
Look, you want to think vey carefully about what you're doing right now.
- Oh, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
I'm all thunk out.
- Mike-
- Shut the fuck up, Kyle.
I'm gonna give you three seconds to get your ugly fat ass outta here.

(muMed shouting)
(garbled):
Kyle!
(screaming in frustration)
- You have to do this.
- It's not gonna make any dimerence.
Nothing does.
- You have to ty.
You know, it's amazing...
The things I could justi_ just to score, you know?
Like, I'll take this from my mom, she'll never know it was gone, or... steal my sistersATM card... siphon om some cash here and there.
What's a kid need with all that money, right?
Then they...
They trashed my house 'cause of the money I owed.
And...
Beat the shit out of my little sister while I was five feet away... fucking blasted out of my mind.
- l couldn't let anyone touch me for the longest time.
- Come on, Mike...
You haven't had anything to eat or drink all day.
Me and Sonia are worried about you, man.
- Oh, you are, huh?
The mo ofyou, the thoughtful couple.
How nice.
God, she finally got to you, huh?
Did she feed you the line...
What was it?
Uh... "l couldn't let anybody touch me for the longest time?"
It's right before she grabs your cock, right?
How was she for you?
You know, I wasn't all that impressed, myself.
The biggest challenge is to find a nice place to fuck around here.
Where'd you do it?
You didn't do it, did you?
What's the matter, buddy?
!
- Look!
Mike!
Just... stop, okay?
Stop.
Let'sjust forget about this, okay?
Let'sjust forget about all this shit...

(laughing)
See, look?

Maybe there'sjust no point in me tying to explain the shit I did.
- Kyle, she'll come around.
- l don't know.
Are you, uh...
Are you okay about earlier?
- Yeah.
I'm vey okay.
Doesn't a part ofyou wonder if maybe he's right?
I mean, if evey good thing we do gets erased...
Evey bad thing we do gets erased...
What does it really matter what we do?
- l guess... I just need for it to matter.
(pounding on door)

(whimpering in fear)

It's only fair that I retum the favour.
Take the knife.

- Come on, Kyle.
Good.
Stand over there.

I'm fine.
-You're gonna die tonight.
Don't ask me how I know, but it's true.
I've thought about what I wanted to say to you so many times.
I don't hate you anymore.
I don't, but I have to move on from this.
I have to, or else nothing's gonna change...
For any of us.
(doo_ell ringing)
- What do you want?
Are you in trouble?
- No, I...
They let us out for a few hours.
Can l-can I come in?

-Are you clean?
- Yeah, Mom.
Please let me talk to her.

The suspect is described as a Caucasian male in his early 20s...

- l need to talk to you.
- Get the fuck out of my room.
- No.
Charlotte, no, I'm not going anywhere until you and I have talked, okay?
- We've got nothing to talk about.
Who's in the ca_
One ofyour addict friends?
- Her name's Sonia.
Yeah, I met her in rehab.
I've been thinking a lot lately...
Just about...
About what I did to you and to Mom.
- l don't want to hear this, Kyle.
-And I can't let another day pass without telling you...
VMthout telling you how sory i am.
- Fine.
Are we through now?
- Thing is,
Charlotte, I see you going down the same path that I did, and-
- You think I'm a fuck-up like you?
- No...
No, that's not what I meant.
- You don't have to watch over me.
- But I... I do.
Charlotte...
Charlotte, I do, 'Cause that's what big brothers do for their little sisters.
And I know you probably don't care right now, but...
But from now on, I'm going to be there foryou.
I'll be there foryou when it counts, because... I love you.
And...
And I'm gonna be your big brother.
(pounding on door)
- T:30, Halsted!
- Sonia!
- Kyle?
- Drop it.
Drop it.
Good.
(whimpering)
Now, I could tie you up all day, Kyle, let you wallow in your own piss, but that's not much fun.
So what we're gonna do is play a little game of hide-and-seek... with a mist.
If I find you... I'm gonna spend the rest of the day hurting you.
(cying)

You've got one minute.

- l don't remember.
- Me neither.
- The same thing happened to all of us.
- Fuck, I'm gonna get that call again.
(door opening)
- Uh, Sonia, there's a call for you.
- Exactly the same.
- You all right?
- Shouldn't we be doing something?
We just lived through the same day mice.
Are we just gonna sit here and waste it?
- Last night, on the news...
There'_there's ajumper at the dam.
Let's go.
Let's do it.
- What about cu_ew?
- Fuck cu_ew.
- Shit, we gotta stop him.
- No, it's...
It's too late.
(Sonia sighs.)
(thunder rumbling)
- Couldn't sleep.
- Me neither.
At least you went to see him.
- l didn't.
- l thought you went to the hospital.
- l went to the hospital, but... I just couldn't go into his room.
- What do you think'd happen ifwe just...
Stayed in here all night?
- Trouble for sure.
- Then I'm not leaving.
(chuckling)
- Why do you think this is happening to us?
- Sory.
- No, it's...
It's okay.
- T:30, Halsted!
- Bob!
- What?
- What day is it?
Last time I checked, it was Wednesday.
- Look, we're gonna figure this out.
- We're not gonna figure out shit, okay?
We're gonna keep repeating the same day over and over again until we go completely out of our fucking minds.
- Okay, but, look, we each had the same shock of electricity or whatever, right?
So...
- So, what?
So maybe that's something that we do?
- Okay, you go and electrocute yourself then, sister, but I'm gonna enjoy it while I got it.
(quietly):
God, what is that girl's problem?
You know, ifyou think about it, it doesn't really matterwhat we do today.
Right?
I mean, I could take a piss in group.
As a matter of fact, I could just piss on Bob.
Tomorrow, it'd be like it never happened.
-Yeah. I don't know, man.
I... just feel like we shouldn't mess with it, you know?
- What do you think we should do with it?
- l don't know.
(laughing)
- Pull it out and put it back.
(laughing):
What?

I can see it in your pants.
Pull it out and put it back!

Only it took him three days to rise from the dead.
- Good morning.
(tray clattering)
- Okay, you died last night.
I saw you die.
- What was it like?
Do you... remember anything?
- l just remember right before, and then... lt's blank.
You know, I've thought about suicide before, but... I mean, right in that moment, right before it happened, I...
Can't believe how bad I wanted to live.
- We have to stop.
Right now.
- What?
- If today hadn't repeated--
- But it did repeat, and it looks like it's gonna keep on repeating.
- Yeah, w-we're tempting fate.
- Wejust gotta figure something out, okay?
We gotta get out of this somehow.
- You've got to be fucking kidding me.
This is a fucking gift.
We can do anything we want, anything.
It's your fuckin' loss.
- Don't you think it's kind ofweird that all this stum happens on the same day your dad dies?
- My dad used to force himself on me.
And a-at first, l-l didn't know what to do.
I mean, I... I didn't even know what he was doing.
And as I got older, I would fight back, but...
Never seemed to stop it.
So, I mean, l-l don't know what...
What, I'm supposed to give him some sort of peace of mind for that?
- Here we go.
No!
- No, no, no!
Don't!
Don't!
No!
- Fuck om!

- Please let me go, please let me go.
(sobbing):
Please...
- It's okay...
(sobbing):
Please let me go...
- The news said it was a man, but... lt was a girl.
Just a girl.
- l know, she's, like, the same age as me.
- Maybe that's what we're supposed to be doing.
You know, maybe we're supposed to be helping people.
- She's still going to be there again tomorrow.
- He grabbed me, and I tried, and I said stop, and he wouldn't, and I...
- Okay, we'll get you anotherjacket.
- Copy that.
We'll bring her in for an assessment.
Get all the necessay tests.
- What's going on?
-A girl got attacked.
(sobbing)
- l need a description.

- Kyle!
Stop!

-You raped her!
You fucking raped her!
- l don't know what you're fucking talking about!
- Don't fucking lie to me!
You raped a 15-year-old girl!
- Okay, fint of all, she was 16, and I'm pretty sure that she was into it.
-You fucking raped her!
- Tomorrow, it'll be like it never happened, Kyle!
- It doesn't make it okay.
- So, what about holding up the liquor store, huh?
is that okay?
What about kidnapping the dealer, sticking a gun in his face, making him eat cow shit?
You were this close to blowing his fucking brains out, Kyle!
Now you're on some fucking guilt trip, you're gonna tell me how I can act?
I don't know why this is happening, but since it is, I'm gonna take advantage of it, okay?
And you two better stay the fuck out of my way.
(tires screeching)
- Why is this happening to us?
(pounding on door)
- T:30, Halsted!
- Bob!
- What do you want, Halsted?
- It's Wednesday, right?
- Last time I checked, yeah.

No, I... I just never thought that she was-
- She was what?
Like you?
- l don't know.
(school bell ringing)
- Okay, so, I have a proposition foryou.
- l don't think I want to hear this proposition.
- l stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
- How did you steal this?
- l took them from her purse like I take eveything.
- Hey, charlotte...
Hey, uh...

- Charlotte!
Hey...
Hi. I'm Sonia.
Um...
Look, I know you think your brothers an asshole, and you're probably right, but... lt'sjust, ifyou would just let him talk to you for a minute, you would be doing me such a favour, okay?
Because I am so tired of hearing him bitch about how shitty he's been to you, and how you'll never forgive him...
Look, we're going to go get some Chinese food.
Why don't you guys come?
- Okay.

We can fit in the truck, right?

I mean, I love the blonde, but your hair... I mean, it goes so well with your eyes.
It's pretty.
-Yeah, well, we already bought the pack, and we're doing it this weekend, so...
- Should be fun.
(door chimesjingling)
- Oh, ho, ho!
Well, well, well... lf thisjust isn't too cute for prime time.
You girls want to get more fucked up than you've ever been in your squeam little lives?
- Put it away, Weeks.
- What, it's okay foryou to smoke meth, but it's omlimits for the rest of the family, is that it?
If it isn't the friendly neighbomood dick!
- Say that again, Weeks.
- How'd they ever let a gutless sack of shit like you become a cop anyways?
- Just keep talking.
Come on, Weeks, keep talking.
All right, you know what, that's not even remotely funny.
Look, you want to think vey carefully about what you're doing right now.
- Oh, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
I'm all thunk out.
- Mike-
- Shut the fuck up, Kyle.
I'm gonna give you three seconds to get your ugly fat ass outta here.

(screaming in frustration)
- You have to do this.
- It's not gonna make any dimerence.
Nothing does.
- You have to ty.
You know, it's amazing...
The things I could justi_ just to score, you know?
Like, I'll take this from my mom, she'll never know it was gone, or... steal my sistersATM card... siphon om some cash here and there.
What's a kid need with all that money, right?
Then they...
They trashed my house 'cause of the money I owed.
And...
Beat the shit out of my little sister while I was five feet away... fucking blasted out of my mind.
- l couldn't let anyone touch me for the longest time.
- Come on, Mike...
You haven't had anything to eat or drink all day.
Me and Sonia are worried about you, man.
- Oh, you are, huh?
The mo ofyou, the thoughtful couple.
How nice.
God, she finally got to you, huh?
Did she feed you the line...
What was it?
Uh... "l couldn't let anybody touch me for the longest time?"
It's right before she grabs your cock, right?
How was she for you?
You know, I wasn't all that impressed, myself.
The biggest challenge is to find a nice place to fuck around here.
Where'd you do it?
You didn't do it, did you?
What's the matter, buddy?
!
- Look!
Mike!
Just... stop, okay?
Stop.

- Kyle, she'll come around.
- l don't know.
Are you, uh...
Are you okay about earlier?
- Yeah.
I'm vey okay.
Doesn't a part ofyou wonder if maybe he's right?
I mean, if evey good thing we do gets erased...
Evey bad thing we do gets erased...
What does it really matter what we do?
- l guess... I just need for it to matter.
(pounding on door)

- No.
I'm fine.
-You're gonna die tonight.
Don't ask me how I know, but it's true.
I've thought about what I wanted to say to you so many times.
I don't hate you anymore.
I don't, but I have to move on from this.
I have to, or else nothing's gonna change...
For any of us.
(doo_ell ringing)

Charlotte, no, I'm not going anywhere until you and I have talked, okay?

Who's in the ca_
One ofyour addict friends?
- Her name's Sonia.
Yeah, I met her in rehab.
I've been thinking a lot lately...
Just about...
About what I did to you and to Mom.
- l don't want to hear this, Kyle.
-And I can't let another day pass without telling you...
VMthout telling you how sory i am.
- Fine.
Are we through now?
- Thing is,
Charlotte, I see you going down the same path that I did, and-
- You think I'm a fuck-up like you?
- No...
No, that's not what I meant.
- You don't have to watch over me.
- But I... I do.
Charlotte...
Charlotte, I do, 'Cause that's what big brothers do for their little sisters.
And I know you probably don't care right now, but...
But from now on, I'm going to be there foryou.
I'll be there foryou when it counts, because... I love you.
And...
And I'm gonna be your big brother.
(pounding on door)
- T:30, Halsted!
- Sonia!
- Kyle?
- Drop it.
Drop it.
Good.
(whimpering)
Now, I could tie you up all day, Kyle, let you wallow in your own piss, but that's not much fun.
So what we're gonna do is play a little game of hide-and-seek... with a mist.
If I find you... I'm gonna spend the rest of the day hurting you.
(cying)
(whispering):

-Are you guys having fun yet?
(gun cocking) You know, the last rehab place I went to...
They had us act out homible events from our past.
What do you say, Logan?
You could be nine years old again.
I could play daddy!
Or maybe Kyle could play daddy since he can't stop fucking you!
- What the fuck are you doing?
(gunshot, man groaning)
- Go.
Go!
(gunfire)
(screaming)
Go!
(panting)
(forklift beeping)

(groaning)
(heavy breathing)
Oh, fuck...

(siren wailing)

Ifyou mo fucking move, I will put a fucking bullet in your head, do you hear me?
I'll fucking kill you.
I will fucking kill you.
- Mom?
I'm sory.
- Lieutenant, this is Kyle Halsted and Sonia Logan.

(speed dial)
(telephone ringing)

Hury up!
Hello?

You thought you had a clean slate.
You didn't know.

(Charlotte sobbing)
- Mike...
We can fix this.
We got into this together, right?
So we can fix it together.
- You guys turned on me, man.
You should've let it go.
You should've let it run its course.
You should have had my back, Kyle!
Mike...
Please...
Don't do this, man.
Don't take it out on them.
Please, man, don't do this to Charlotte.
(screaming and whimpering)
Mike?

(gunshot, Kyle groaning)
(cying)

I neverwas, and I neverwill.
It doesn't matter how many days repeat!

(gunshot, girls screaming)
(sobbing)
Shh, shh... lt's okay, it's okay...
Shh, shh...
Shh...
Shh, it's okay.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Where the doors are moaning
All day long
Where the stairs are leaning
Dusk till dawn
Where the windows
Are breathing in the light
Where the rooms are
A collection of our lives
Where the doors
Are moaning all day long
Where the stairs are leaning
Dusk till dawn
Where the windows
Are breathing in the light
Where the rooms are
A collection of our lives
(siren wailing)
This is a place
Where I don'tfeel alone
This is a place
That I call my home...
(pounding on door)
- Get up, Weeks.
Another day in paradise.
Breakneck speed
Tying up your hands
'Cause you're landing back on yourfeet
You know what I mean
Vowel change
I remember when our voices used to sound the same
Now wejust translate
'Cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
A_erwhat you did
Born on yourfeet running
Forest fires underneath your bed
But it's good to be back
Good to be back Good to be back
Spell it out
I always skip thewords
'Cause all the pictures are so bright and loud
Better omthan now
'Cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
A_erwhat you did
Born on yourfeet running
Forest fires underneath your bed
'Cause it's good to be back
Good to be back
Super fun
At the movies drunk and young
Double knots that came undone
But the big bad years are gone
Yeah the big bad years are done
And gone away
I remember when our voices used to sound the exact same
Now wejust translate
'Cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
A_erwhat you did
Born on yourfeet running
Forest fires underneath your bed
But it's good to be back
Good to be back Good to be back
(pounding on door)
- 7:30, Halsted!
(chattering)
- Nice one, loser!
- How many's that?
- 92 and counting.
- We're supposed to get out today for a bit.
- Step nine, making amends.
Can't wait.
- Let's go.
Good morning.
- He hit on me yesterday.
(scoffing)
- Nice one, douchebag!
(cackling)
- Hey, pick that up.
- Hey!
Hey!
- Come on!
- You're dead.
-All right, tough guy.
You too.
Thank you.
There you go.
I need you to sit down.
- What are you looking at, huh?
- Fuck...
Get me out of this place, please.
- I know it isn't easy, but taking that step towards reconciliation with the people most hurt by your addictions, that's the door to recovery.
Okay, we're gonna keep working at this.
This is mandatory policy now in all rehabilitation centres.
Each and every one of you will be participating.
You're gonna be getting a day pass every day this week, so get out there and make good use of your time.
Remember, don't rush, all right?
Every step is a good one... (schoolbell ringing)
Okay, so, I have a proposition for you.
- I don't think I want to hear this-
- I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
- Okay.
- I don't know how to--
- Are you holding it?
- Yeah, I'm holding it.
- So you put it...
- Hey, Charlotte.
No, hey, Char-
- I don't want to talk to you, Kyle.
- charlotte, come on, I'm-I'm still your brother.
- No, I don't want to talk to him...
- Well, well.
If it isn't one of our illustrious alumni.
If you and whatever drugs you're selling aren't off the school property in the next 30 seconds,
I'm going to call the police.
(engine revving)
(tires screeching)
(monitors beeping)
- All third floor staff to the nurses' station...
- Hey, Dad.
How you doing?
- What do you want?
-Are they-are they treating you all right?
(impatient banging)
- What the fuck do you want, you little prick?
Huh?
(banging on glass)
I told you I never wanted to see you again.
You get out of my sight.
Ten years because of you, you fuckin' dope fiend.
You fuckin' coward!
(loud banging)
If I see you again, I will fucking kill you!
If you come back here, I'll fucking kill you!
I swear, I'll kill you!
- Okay, so let's talk about today's adventures.
Kyle?
- Do I have to?
- Please.
(heavy sighing)
- I went to see my sister.
- Okay, and how did that go?
- Not very well.
- Can you elaborate?
- No.
- Kyle-
- He doesn't want to talk about it.
- Talking is the only way to move forward.
- Oh, fuck you and move forward!
Fuck this whole place!
None of this makes any fucking difference to us!
(chair slamming)
- Fuck, I hate Bob.
- He's a cock.
- He's a fuckin' idiot.
It's "make amends" day.
Good to see you.
Sorry about all that money I stole.
- Yeah, sorry for ruining your life.
Oh, wait a minute, you ruined my life.
- It's all fucking bullshit anyways.
- Speaking of which.
- Sonia...
There's a call for you.
- My dad just died.
(lighter flicking)
(soft music)
(Music:
The Antlers
- Kettering) # I wish that I had known # # in that first minute we met #
# The unpayable debt #
# That I owed you #
# 'Cause you'd been abused # # by that bone that refused you #
# And you hired me # # to make up for that... #
(crying)
- Just after 11:
OO this morning, an unidentified man threw himself off the Mission City dam.
Authorities believe he died on impact, but crews are still dredging the reservoir to find his body.
In Mission City... (music intensifying) (thunder rumbling)
(bulb shattering)
- Fuck...
(switch flicking)
(electricity crackling)
(humming)
(knocking insistently)
- Let's go!
(humming)
(pounding on door) 7:30, Halsted!
- Nice one, loser!
- It's weird.
- What?
93, right?
- Yeah, should be 93, but... 92.
- Let's go.
Good morning.
- Nice one, douchebag!
(cackling)
-All right, funny guy, clean it up.
- What?
- Right now.
Right now.
- Shit...
- All of it.
- Did you guys see that?
- Fuck you, Bob.
- Get back here.
- Dick.
- Hey...
Get back here!
- That was fucking weird.
(buzzer blaring)
(school bell ringing)
- Okay, so, I have a proposition for you.
- I don't think I want to hear this proposition.
- I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
- How did you steal this?
- I took it from her purse like I take everything, okay?
- I don't know how to--
- Okay, just hold it.
- Okay, okay, I'm holding it.
- Okay, right?
- Yeah.
- Now you have to put it to your lips like you're French.
- Okay.
- Okay.
(giggling)
- You'll never get that!
(monitors beeping)
- All third-floor staff to the nurses' station...
- Pick up the fuckin' phone.
What?
Pick up the goddamn phone.
(banging impatiently)
I told you I never wanted to see you again!
You get outta my sight!
Ten years 'cause of you!
You fuckin' dope fiend!
(loud banging)
You fuckin' coward!
I see you again, I will fucking kill you!
If you come back here, I'll fucking kill you!
I swear, I'll kill you!
- Well, well.
If it isn't one of our illustrious alumni.
If you and whatever drugs you're selling are not off the school property in the next 30 seconds,
I'm calling the police.
(engine starting)
(security buzzer blaring)
- Okay, so let's talk about today's adventures.
Kyle?
- Yeah?
- What did you do today?
- Uh...
I went to see my sister.
(laughing)
- And how did that go for you?
- Not very well.
(laughing)
- Can you elaborate on that, please?
- No.
- Halsted.
Halsted.
Kyle... (voice echoing dreamily):
Kyle...
- What the fuck is going on?
How is this even possible?
I mean...
Wait...
The storm.
Last night, the power went out, right?
I was in the rec room and I-I touched the TV.
I got this shock.
That's the last thing I remember.
- Same thing happened with me with my light.
- Weeks?
- Who cares how it happened?
The real question is, what are we gonna do with it?
- What were you doing last night?
- What were you doing?
- I was in the shower, okay?
I got shocked, too.
- Then what?
- I don't remember.
- Me neither.
- The same thing happened to all of us.
- Fuck, I'm gonna get that call again.
(door opening)
- Uh, Sonia, there's a call for you.
- Exactly the same.
- You all right?
- Shouldn't we be doing something?
We just lived through the same day twice.
Are we just gonna sit here and waste it?
- Last night, on the news...
There's-there's a jumper at the dam.
Let's go.
Let's do it.
- What about curfew?
- Fuck curfew.
- Shit, we gotta stop him.
- No, it's...
It's too late.
(Sonia sighs.)
(thunder rumbling)
- Couldn't sleep.
- Me neither.
At least you went to see him.
- I didn't.
- I thought you went to the hospital.
- I went to the hospital, but...
I just couldn't go into his room.
- What do you think'd happen if we just...
Stayed in here all night?
- Trouble for sure.
- Then I'm not leaving.
(chuckling)
- Why do you think this is happening to us?
- Sorry.
- No, it's...
It's okay.
- 7:30, Halsted!
- Bob!
- What?
- What day is it?
Last time I checked, it was Wednesday.
- Look, we're gonna figure this out.
- We're not gonna figure out shit, okay?
We're gonna keep repeating the same day over and over again until we go completely out of our fucking minds.
- Okay, but, look, we each had the same shock of electricity or whatever, right?
So...
- So, what?
So maybe that's something that we do?
- Okay, you go and electrocute yourself then, sister, but I'm gonna enjoy it while I got it.
(quietly):
God, what is that girl's problem?
You know, ifyou think about it, it doesn't really matter what we do today.
Right?
I mean, I could take a piss in group.
As a matter of fact, I could just piss on Bob.
Tomorrow, it'd be like it never happened.
-Yeah.
I don't know, man.
I... just feel like we shouldn't mess with it, you know?
- What do you think we should do with it?
- I don't know.
(laughing)
- Pull it out and put it back.
(laughing):
What?
- The bottle of gin.
I can see it in your pants.
Pull it out and put it back!
- It's not in my pants.
- What do you call that?
Put it back!
You know what, both of you, get the hell out of my store!
Both of you, get out!
Idiots!
(laughing)
- Feeling better?
- Oh, starting to.
- What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
Oh, no, dude.
We'd better pray tomomow repeats.
(engine roaring to life) (laughing)
Fuck!
(whooping in excitement)
(laughing)
(tires squealing)
You're sick!
Sick!
Oh, Bobby... (heavy metal music)
Whoa, Bob likes pussy.
Who am I?
Who am I?
(humming)
Bob... loves... lady cock.
(laughing)
- What the fuck?
- Oh, no...
Nearly Legal.
Near1y Legal.
Fuck, look.
(laughing) Oh, fuck.
- All right, freeze, boys!
Party's over.
Hands on your head.
Let's go, right now.
Hands on your head.
That's it.
Looks like you screwed up royally this time, eh, Weeks, huh?
Just like the old man, huh?
Hands behind your back.
(laughing)
Halsted.
Your mom posted bail.
- See you this morning.
- Well...
Looks like no daddy coming for you, cowboy.
- Breaking and entering?
Vandalism?
Your first day pass and that's what you do with it, huh?
Well, you must be really proud of yourself.
You have any idea what that little exercise just cost me?
Kyle...
- Just after 11:
OO this morning, an unidentified man threw himself off the Mission City dam--
(heavy sighing)
- It's weird.
I was scared, but...
At the same time, I felt... really alive.
- What if it doesn't repeat?
You're gonna have a criminal record on top of your drug histoy.
That's pretty awesome, Halsted.
(pounding on door) - 7:30, Halsted!
- Hey, Bob?
Bob...
I hear there's been a few break-ins in the neighbourhood lately?
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Nothing.
- Okay, come on, let's go.
Get your ass in gear.
(chattering)
(chattering)
- Hello.
- Well, hello.
(chuckling)
Again.
- Every time.
- Let's go.
- Bob, lookin' slick.
(awkwardly):
Morning.
(laughing)
(quietly):
Nice one, douchebag.
(tray clattering)
(laughing)
So, what's on the program?
- Clean it up.
Right now.
- You know,
I think our man, Bob, on his down time, he likes to just settle in with a little bit of Victoria gin.
- Victoria gin?
- Yeah, yeah, a little bit of lubrication before he kicks off his shoes, and he thumbs through his favorite magazine... (chanting together):
Nearly Legal!
- Right, Bob?
(laughter)
- I knew he was a pig.
- Oh, not to worry, Logan.
I think you're a bit too old for him now.
- Fuck you.
(laughing)
- Well, fuck it, cowpokes, let's celebrate!
- Yeah.
(country music)
(screaming)
- Yeah!
- Three more!
Here!
Baby, baby, baby, baby...
- Woo!
-Are you gonna be able to pay for all this?
- Oh, you bet your sweet ass, girl.
- All right, yeah, I'm gonna need you to settle up.
- I apologize.
He hasn't gotten laid in a bit.
- A very long time.
You want to help me out with that?
- Oh...
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
That there male and that there female are gonna pay for me.
- I have no money.
- Fuck sakes...
- I'm so sorry!
- Okay, thanks, partner, that was great!
All right, uh, I'm gonna sing a little song to pay for some drinks.
- Woo!
- Yeah, that's right, pal!
And I'm gonna dedicate it to my to friends.
Y'all know who you are-
- It's us!
We're his friends!
Oh, my darlin' oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin' Clementine
- Let him sing!
Hey, let him sing!
(car horns blaring) (laughing hysterically)
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin' Clementine... (laughing)
(Weeks making goofy noises.)
- Where did you get this from?
- What was that noise?
(laughing)
And?
(oinking)
- Oh, that is--
Mine stinks, dude.
- Milady?
- Oh, shit.
Wow.
- My friend.
One for you.
- Oh, my G.--
Are we really gonna do this?
- Tell me you haven't always wanted to knock of a liquor store?
-Are these things clean?
- What?
- Well, they jam if they're dirty, right?
(laughing):
We're not going to shoot anybody.
Okay, you know what, the only thing that my old man cares about more than his knife collection is his fucking gun collection.
So yeah, they're clean.
Let's do this, kiddies!
Oink!
Oink!
(rock music)
Stick your hands up!
It's a stick-up!
Let's go!
- Try to touch my dick and I'll blow your fuckin' brains out!
Go!
(laughing)
- Shit...
- Open the fuckin' register!
- Okay.
- You think this is fuckin' funny?
Hurry up!
Get me a bag, fuck!
Quick!
Here...
- What the fuck?
(laughing)
- Shit, there's a car!
- What?
- There's a car, fuck!
Hurry up!
- Let's go!
- Hurry!
- Let's go, come on!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
(laughing)
(song playing)
(laughing) (indistinct conversation)
Oh, my God, what the fuck?
(laughing in triumph)
- How much did we get?
- I don't know, man.
There's like 500 bucks here and 42 pennies.
(laughing) I took it all, man.
I took it all.
(wailing sirens approaching)
Shit... (laughing)
(knocking)
(knocking on door)
- Yo, Tiko, what's up, man?
- Well, if it isn't my favourite customer, man.
Long time, no show, bro.
- Yeah, man.
Look, um...
Michelle?
Charlotte?
Tiko, what the fuck, man?
Tell me you didn't get my sister fuckin' high.
- That's not all we did, G.
- Hey...
- Charlotte!
- Easy!
Fuck...
Jesus...
We good?
Nobody in there wants to talk to you.
Okay, man?
So just fuck off.
- Fuck you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- There's room for you.
- Nice fuckin' sweatpants.
(laughing)
- Don't worry, guys.
I know a guy that we can score from.
Welcome to my drug of choice, kiddies.
- This shit always fuckin' scared me.
- They say you're addicted the moment you take your first hit.
Only today...
You get to be unaddicted again.
(sighing)
Here it comes.
Go, go, go, go, go.
(exhaling shakily)
(gunfire)
(Music:
The Kills

(laughing)
- Nearly Legal!
(laughing)
I mean, she is fuckin' hot, though.
# Time's just gonna hit on you #

(pounding)
- Hold the fuck on!

(taser crackling)
(giggling)
- Grab his legs.
(giggling)
- Jesus...
Fuck, he's heavy.
- Fuck... (groaning with effort)
- God, Tiko...
- Get on your knees.
Get on your fuckin' knees!
- Okay, okay...
We were just having some fun, man.
I didn't-I didn't-
- Shut the fuck up!
- Okay, okay, okay... (whispering):
Come on, man.
- Pick that up.
- What?
(gunshot)
- Pick that up.
- No, man.
Fuck you, man!
- Pick that up, you fuck!
- Fuck... I didn't touch your fucking sister, man!
- Pick it fucking up!
- Don't make me fucking do this, man.
Don't make me do it, man...
- Fuck.
Don't fucking cy, just fuckin' pick it up.
(sobbing):
No...
(whimpering)
- Mm-hmm.
Now take a bite.
(sniveling)
Take a bite, Tiko...
(sobbing)
(gagging and retching)
(sobbing)
- Fuck you, man!
I didn't touch your fucking sister, man!
(sobbing)
You're all going to fucking jail!
Fuck you!
(sobbing)
(giggling)
-All right, kiddies, let's go.
- It's okay.
Woo!
(whooping with excitement)
- Time to up the ante!
If you slip?
Bang!
Wake up in bed like it's a bad dream.
- Yeah, that's assuming we have another repeat.
- Hmm, if we don't... (cowboy accent) Make sure they burry me with my boots on.
(gasping)
- Jesus... (laughing)
- Hey, Mike, come on, man.
- Shh...
Kyle... (cowboy accent) You're gonna mess up my concentration.
(laughing)
(water roaring)
(laughing)
Ah...
Who's next?
Huh?
- Hey...
- What?
- What are you doing?
You're ripped out of your mind.
We still don't even know if we're gonna repeat.
We can't fuck around like this.
- I'm okay.
It's okay.
- Oh, who is this girl?
There you go, girl.
Rip that pole.
(laughing)
Oh, one foot, one foot-
- Fuck off, Weeks!
(laughing)
(laughing)
- Woo!
I saw a smile!
- Stop it!
(laughing)
- I won't say another word--
(screaming)
- No!
- Don't let go!
Weeks!
Weeks, help me!
(laughing)
- No!
(screaming)
(laughing)
- You're fuckin' dead!
(laughing) You're fucking dead, you fuck!
Fuck you!
- See you this morning!
- Fuck you!
(laughing) You're fucking dead!
(pounding on door) - 7:30, Halsted.
(chattering and laughter)
- You should get some hashbrowns before they're all gone.
(tray crashing)
- Nice one, loser!
- Never realized how much I loved the hashbrowns.
- Jesus...
- Yeah.
Only it took him three days to rise from the dead.
- Good morning.
(tray clattering)
- Okay, you died last night.
I saw you die.
- What was it like?
Do you... remember anything?
- I just remember right before, and then...
It's blank.
You know, I've thought about suicide before, but...
I mean, right in that moment, right before it happened,
I...
Can't believe how bad I wanted to live.
- We have to stop.
Right now.
- What?
- If today hadn't repeated--
- But it did repeat, and it looks like it's gonna keep on repeating.
- Yeah, w-we're tempting fate.
- We just gotta figure something out, okay?
We gotta get out of this somehow.
- You've got to be fucking kidding me.
This is a fucking gift.
We can do anything we want, anything.
It's your fuckin' loss.
- Don't you think it's kind of weird that all this stuff happens on the same day your dad dies?
- My dad used to force himself on me.
And a-at first, I-I didn't know what to do.
I mean, I...
I didn't even know what he was doing.
And as I got older,
I would fight back, but...
Never seemed to stop it.
So, I mean, I-I don't know what...
What, I'm supposed to give him some sort of peace of mind for that?
- Here we go.
No!
- No, no, no!
Don't!
Don't!
No!
- Fuck off!
- No!
- You don't want to do this!
- Who are you?
- You don't want to do this.
Look at me.
- Let go of me!
- You don't want to do this.
- Please let me go, please let me go.
(sobbing):
Please...
- It's okay...
(sobbing):
Please let me go...
- The news said it was a man, but...
It was a girl.
Just a girl.
- I know, she's, like, the same age as me.
- Maybe that's what we're supposed to be doing.
You know, maybe we're supposed to be helping people.
- She's still going to be there again tomorrow.
- He grabbed me, and I tried, and I said stop, and he wouldn't, and I ...
- Okay, we'll get you another jacket.
- Copy that.
We'll bring her in for an assessment.
Get all the necessary tests.
- What's going on?
-A girl got attacked.
(sobbing)
- I need a description.
- I don't know what he looked like!
- Do you know who did this to you?
- Don't touch me!
- Can you give me a description?
- It was him.
- What?
- It was him!
- Hey, hey!
- Just let me go...
Don't touch me, okay?
- What the hell is the matter with you Kyle, huh?
- Kyle!
Stop!
Stop it!
- What the fuck?
- You raped her!
You fucking raped her!
- I don't know what you're fucking talking about!
- Don't fucking lie to me!
You raped a 15-year-old girl!
- Okay, first of all, she was 16, and I'm pretty sure that she was into it.
- You fucking raped her!
- Tomorrow, it'll be like it never happened, Kyle!
- It doesn't make it okay.
- So, what about holding up the liquor store, huh?
Is that okay?
What about kidnapping the dealer, sticking a gun in his face, making him eat cow shit?
You were this close to blowing his fucking brains out, Kyle!
Now you're on some fucking guilt trip, you're gonna tell me how I can act?
I don't know why this is happening, but since it is, I'm gonna take advantage of it, okay?
And you two better stay the fuck out of my way.
(tires screeching)
- Why is this happening to us?
(pounding on door) - 7:30, Halsted!
- Bob!
- What do you want, Halsted?
- It's Wednesday, right?
- Last time I checked, yeah.
(chair leg clattering)
- Nice one, loser!
- I can't believe that Charlotte was hanging out with Tiko.
No, I...
I just never thought that she was-
- She was what?
Like you?
- I don't know.
(school bell ringing)
- Okay, so, I have a proposition for you.
- I don't think I want to hear this proposition.
- I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
- How did you steal this?
- I took them from her purse like I take everything.
- Hey, charlotte...
Hey, uh...
Look, do you want to, uh... just, um-
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Charlotte!
Hey...
Hi.
I'm Sonia.
Um...
Look, I know you think your brother's an asshole, and you're probably right, but... it's just, if you would just let him talk to you for a minute, you would be doing me such a favour, okay?
Because I am so tired of hearing him bitch about how shitty he's been to you, and how you'll never forgive him...
Look, we're going to go get some Chinese food.
Why don't you guys come?
- Okay.
- Okay.
We can fit in the truck, right?
- Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Come in.
What color?
- Blonde.
- You're gonna go blonde?
- Yeah.
- No...
Did not know.
I mean, I love the blonde, but your hair...
I mean, it goes so well with your eyes.
It's pretty.
- Yeah, well, we already bought the pack, and we're doing it this weekend, so...
- Should be fun.
(door chimes jingling)
- Oh, ho, ho!
Well, well, well...
If this just isn't too cute for prime time.
You girls want to get more fucked up than you've ever been in your squeaky little lives?
- Put it away, Weeks.
- What, it's okay for you to smoke meth, but it's off limits for the rest of the family, is that it?
If it isn't the friendly neighborhood dick!
- Say that again, Weeks.
- How'd they ever let a gutless sack of shit like you become a cop anyways?
- Just keep talking.
Come on, Weeks, keep talking.
All right, you know what, that's not even remotely funny.
Look, you want to think very carefully about what you're doing right now.
- Oh, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
I'm all thunk out.
- Mike-
- Shut the fuck up, Kyle.
I'm gonna give you three seconds to get your ugly fat ass outta here.
One...
Hand away from the gun, Gerald.
Hand away from the gun.
There you go, there you go.
Two...
(door chimes jingling)
(gunfire)
(people screaming)
Fucking mess with me!
Yeah, no daddy coming for you!
Fuck off!
You don't know what you're missing.
- You guys okay?
Hey...
You okay?
Charlotte, you okay?
You all right?
You okay?
(people sobbing and whimpering in shock)
(pounding on door) - 7:30, Halsted!
- What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
- Hey, everything that you're doing is gonna stay with you!
It's gonna stay with all of us!
- No, Kyle!
You do not want to do this, Kyle!
(muffled shouting)
(garbled):
Kyle!
(screaming in frustration)
- You have to do this.
- It's not gonna make any difference.
Nothing does.
- You have to try.
You know, it's amazing...
The things I could justify just to score, you know?
Like, I'll take this from my mom, she'll never know it was gone, or... steal my sister's ATM card... siphon off some cash here and there.
What's a kid need with all that money, right?
Then they...
They trashed my house 'cause of the money I owed.
And...
Beat the shit out of my little sister while I was five feet away... fucking blasted out of my mind.
- I couldn't let anyone touch me for the longest time.
- Come on, Mike...
You haven't had anything to eat or drink all day.
Me and Sonia are worried about you, man.
- Oh, you are, huh?
The two of you, the thoughtful couple.
How nice.
God, she finally got to you, huh?
Did she feed you the line...
What was it?
Uh... "I couldn't let anybody touch me for the longest time?"
It's right before she grabs your cock, right?
How was she for you?
You know, I wasn't all that impressed, myself.
The biggest challenge is to find a nice place to fuck around here.
Where'd you do it?
You didn't do it, did you?
What's the matter, buddy?
!
- Look!
Mike!
Just... stop, okay?
Stop.
Let's just forget about this, okay?
Let's just forget about all this shit...
And just try again.
Let's try to figure this out.
There's got to be some kind of deeper meaning... to this.
(laughing)
- I ...
I just took a piss in my pants.
There's got to be some deeper meaning in that, don't you think?
(laughing)
See, look?
(laughing)
I 'll see you this morning!
-Are you tipsy yet?
- Maybe.
(girls giggling)
Aren't you supposed to be locked up somewhere?
- charlotte, I need to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Charlotte...
- Fuck off.
- I just thought if I could talk to her... if I could explain...
Maybe there's just no point in me trying to explain the shit I did.
- Kyle, she'll come around.
- I don't know.
Are you, uh...
Are you okay about earlier?
- Yeah.
I'm very okay.
Doesn't a part of you wonder if maybe he's right?
I mean, if every good thing we do gets erased...
Every bad thing we do gets erased...
What does it really matter what we do?
- I guess...
I just need for it to matter.
(pounding on door) - 7:30 Halsted!
(tray clattering)
- Nice one, loser!
- Hey...
Bob, where's Mike?
- What?
- Sonia?
You know where they are?
I don't know, Halsted, having a smoke?
I don't know.
(whimpering in fear)
- Drop the club.
Come on, Kyle, it's a fucking club.
Drop it.
You think you can decide how I spend my repeats?
It's only fair that I return the favor.
Take the knife.
(crying)
The knife on the table, take it.
- What?
- Come on, Kyle.
Good.
Stand over there.
- Mike, what-
- Now...
Cut his throat.
(whimpering and cying)
- Mike, please don't do this.
- Cut his throat, or I'll put a bullet in her leg.
I kid you not, Kyle.
I will put a hole in her leg the size of a fucking grapefruit.
(gunshot) (screaming)
Do it, or I'll put a bullet in her head!
- You're fucked!
- That's right, get angy!
Get motherfucking feral!
Cut his fucking throat!
(muffled cying)
(strangled choking)
Welcome to the club, Kyle.
- You're okay... (moaning in pain)
Come on, come on.
(whimpering)
All right...
- We'll have fun...
- I'm okay.
Come on, what's wrong?
Come on...
- No, I'm okay.
I'm okay.
- Fuck!
- Get the fuck up!
Get up, you fucking piece of shit.
- I knew you had it in you.
I'm gonna give you three seconds to get lost.
- Fuck you.
(gunshot, girl screaming)
(voice echoing):
See you this morning, Kyle.
(pounding on door) - 7:30, Halsted!
(panting in terror)
- Do you want me to come up?
- No.
I'm fine.
-You're gonna die tonight.
Don't ask me how I know, but it's true.
I've thought about what I wanted to say to you so many times.
I don't hate you anymore.
I don't, but I have to move on from this.
I have to, or else nothing's gonna change...
For any of us.
(doorbell ringing)
- What do you want?
Are you in trouble?
- No, I...
They let us out for a few hours.
Can I-can I come in?
I really need to talk to Charlotte.
- I-I really don't think it's a good idea.
- Mom, I really need to talk to her.
-Are you clean?
- Yeah, Mom.
Please let me talk to her.
- Okay.
- Residents are reeling tonight over the death of two local police officers in what's shaping up to be a double homicide.
The suspect is described as a Caucasian male in his early 20s...
- Charlotte?
- What are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.
- Get the fuck out of my room.
- No.
Charlotte, no, I'm not going anywhere until you and I have talked, okay?
- We've got nothing to talk about.
Who's in the car?
One of your addict friends?
- Her name's Sonia.
Yeah, I met her in rehab.
I've been thinking a lot lately...
Just about...
About what I did to you and to mom.
- I don't want to hear this, Kyle.
-And I can't let another day pass without telling you...
Without telling you how sorry I am.
- Fine.
Are we through now?
- Thing is,
Charlotte, I see you going down the same path that I did, and-
- You think I'm a fuck-up like you?
- No...
No, that's not what vmeant.
- You don't have to watch over me.
- But I...
I do.
Charlotte...
Charlotte, I do, 'Cause that's what big brothers do for their little sisters.
And I know you probably don't care right now, but...
But from now on, I'm going to be there for you.
I'll be there for you when it counts, because...
I love you.
And...
And I'm gonna be your big brother.
(pounding on door) - 7:30, Halsted!
- Sonia!
- Kyle?
- Drop it.
Drop it.
Good.
(whimpering)
Now, I could tie you up all day, Kyle, let you wallow in your own piss, but that's not much fun.
So what we're gonna do is play a little game of hide-and-seek... with a twist.
If I find you...
I'm gonna spend the rest of the day hurting you.
(crying)
(whispering):
You've got one minute.
One minute.
- You okay?
(gun cocking)
- Other door.
One...
- Come on!
- ... two... three... four... five... six... seven. ..
eight... nine.. .
ten... (panting)
- Come on, come on...
- One minute!
(engine revving)
- There!
There!
This way!
Yeah!
- Woo!
(engine revving)
(panting)
- Come on.
Come on...
- Come on out, kiddies, I ain't got all day.
Come on out!
(gunshot) (gunshot ricocheting)
- Come on.
Come on!
Come on...
Come on, come on... (gunshot) (glass shattering)
(screaming)
Go!
Come on!
Go!
- Are you guys having fun yet?
(gun cocking) You know, the last rehab place I went to...
They had us act out horrible events from our past.
What do you say, Logan?
You could be nine years old again.
I could play daddy!
Or maybe Kyle could play daddy since he can't stop fucking you!
- What the fuck are you doing?
(gunshot, man groaning)
- Go.
Go!
(gunfire)
(screaming)
Go!
(panting)
(forklift beeping)
- Hey...
Hey, kid!
(gun cocking)
Hey, you all right?
(gunshot, man groaning)
- It doesn't snow today.
What day is it?
I said, what day is it?
!
(groaning)
(heavy breathing)
Oh, fuck...
- How are you doing?
- I'm fine.
I just got a tetanus shot and some stitches.
Where is he?
- No one's seen him.
- We need you to come with us.
(siren wailing)
- Get your fucking head down on the floor!
If you two fucking move,
I will put a fucking bullet in your head, do you hear me?
I'll fucking kill you.
I will fucking kill you.
- Mom?
I'm sorry.
- Lieutenant, this is Kyle Halsted and Sonia Logan.
- So I understand you've been brought up to speed?
- Yeah.
- Most important thing is you keep him calm.
(speed dial)
(telephone ringing)
- Gimme the phone, come on.
Hurry up!
Hello?
- I have your friend right here.
- Mike?
- Kyle.
- Mike, man, y-you didn't know.
You thought the day was gonna repeat again, right?
You thought you had a clean slate.
You didn't know.
- You think a jury's gonna fuckin' believe that?
(Charlotte sobbing)
- Mike...
We can fix this.
We got into this together, right?
So we can fix it together.
- You guys turned on me, man.
You should've let it go.
You should've let it run its course.
You should have had my back, Kyle!
Mike...
Please...
Don't do this, man.
Don't take it out on them.
Please, man, don't do this to Charlotte.
(screaming and whimpering)
Mike?
Mike!
- Okay, we're going to have to go inside.
- No, no, let me try again, I can--
- Listen, this kid has killed two people already.
Come with me.
Hey, hey, hey!
- No, no, Kyle, don't!
- Stand down!
Everybody, stand down!
- Mike?
- Kyle, you die now, you die for keeps.
- Mike, I'm coming up, man.
(crying)
Mike, you gotta let 'em go.
(crying)
- Nobody move.
Nobody fucking move!
Stay still and shut up!
- Mike!
That's my sister.
That's my baby sister and I'm not gonna let you hurt her, okay?
(crying)
- I'm warning you, Kyle.
Stay where you are.
- Mike...
It's over.
- Stop.
- Just give me the gun.
- Stop.
(gunshot, Kyle groaning)
(crying)
- I was never gonna make amends with my old man.
I never was, and I never will.
It doesn't matter how many days repeat!
- Give me the gun.
- That's the difference between you and me, right?
- Mike!
(gunshot, girls screaming)
(sobbing)
Shh, shh... lt's okay, it's okay...
Shh, shh...
Shh...
Shh, it's okay.
- You okay?
- Yeah.

- Oh, fuck you and move fonNard!
Fuck this whole place!
None of this makes any fucking dimerence to us!
- Fuck, I hate Bob.
- He's a cock.
- He's a fuckin' idiot.
It's "make amends" day.
Good to see you.
Sory about all that money I stole.
- Yeah, sory for ruining your life.
Oh, wait a minute, you ruined my life.
- It's all fucking bullshit anyways.
- Speaking ofwhich.
- Sonia...
There's a call for you.
- My dad just died.
I wish that I had known ln that first minute we met
The unpayable debt
That I owed you
'Cause you'd been abused by that bone that refused you
And you hired me to make upfor that...
OO this morning, an unidentified man threw himsem om the Mission City dam.
Authorities believe he died on impact, but crews are still dredging the reservoir tofind his body.
In Mission City...

Kyle...
- What the fuck is going on?
How is this even possible?
I mean... _it...
The stonn.
Last night, the powerwent out, right?
I was in the rec room and l-l touched the TV.
I got this shock.
That's the last thing I remember.
- Same thing happened with me with my light.
- Weeks?
- Who cares how it happened?
The real question is, what are we gonna do with it?
- What were you doing last night?
- Whatwere you doing?
- l was in the shower, okay?
I got shocked, too.
- Then what?
- l don't remember.
- Me neither.
- The same thing happened to all of us.
- Fuck, I'm gonna get that call again.
- Uh, Sonia, there's a call for you.
- Exactly the same.
- You all right?
- Shouldn't we be doing something?
We just lived through the same day mice.
Are we just gonna sit here and waste it?
- Last night, on the news...
There'_there's ajumper at the dam.
Let's go.
Let's do it.
- What about cu_ew?
- Fuck cu_ew.
- Shit, we gotta stop him.
- No, it's...
It's too late.
- Couldn't sleep.
- Me neither.
At least you went to see him.
- l didn't.
- l thought you went to the hospital.
- l went to the hospital, but... I just couldn't go into his room.
- What do you think'd happen ifwe just...
Stayed in here all night?
- Trouble for sure.
- Then I'm not leaving.
- Why do you think this is happening to us?
- Sory.
- No, it's...
It's okay.
- T:30, Halsted!
- Bob!
- What?
- What day is it?
Last time I checked, it was Wednesday.
- Look, we're gonna figure this out.
- We're not gonna figure out shit, okay?
We're gonna keep repeating the same day over and over again until we go completely out of our fucking minds.
- Okay, but, look, we each had the same shock of electricity or whatever, right?
So...
- So, what?
So maybe that's something that we do?
- Okay, you go and electrocute yourself then, sister, but I'm gonna enjoy it while I got it.
God, what is that girl's problem?
You know, ifyou think about it, it doesn't really matterwhat we do today.

Nice one, loser!
- Never realized how much I loved the hashbrowns.
- Jesus...
- Yeah.
Only it took him three days to rise from the dead.
- Good morning.
- Okay, you died last night.
I saw you die.
- What was it like?
Do you... remember anything?
- l just remember right before, and then... lt's blank.
You know, I've thought about suicide before, but... I mean, right in that moment, right before it happened, I...
Can't believe how bad I wanted to live.
- We have to stop.
Right now.
- What?
- If today hadn't repeated--
- But it did repeat, and it looks like it's gonna keep on repeating.
- Yeah, w-we're tempting fate.
- Wejust gotta figure something out, okay?
We gotta get out of this somehow.
- You've got to be fucking kidding me.
This is a fucking gift.
We can do anything we want, anything.
It's your fuckin' loss.
- Don't you think it's kind ofweird that all this stum happens on the same day your dad dies?
- My dad used to force himself on me.
And a-at first, l-l didn't know what to do.
I mean, I... I didn't even know what he was doing.
And as I got older, I would fight back, but...
Never seemed to stop it.
So, I mean, l-l don't know what...
What, I'm supposed to give him some sort of peace of mind for that?
- Here we go.
No!
- No, no, no!
Don't!
Don't!
No!
- Fuck om!
- No!
- You don't want to do this!
- Who are you?

- You don't want to do this.
- Please let me go, please let me go.
:
Please...
It's okay...
:
Please let me go...
- The news said it was a man, but... lt was a girl.
Just a girl.
- l know, she's, like, the same age as me.
- Maybe that's what we're supposed to be doing.
You know, maybe we're supposed to be helping people.
- She's still going to be there again tomorrow.
- He grabbed me, and I tried, and I said stop, and he wouldn't, and I...
- Okay, we'll get you anotherjacket.
- Copy that.
We'll bring her in for an assessment.
Get all the necessay tests.
- What's going on?
- A girl got attacked.
- l need a description.
- l don't know what he looked like!
- Do you know who did this to you?
- Don't touch me!
- Can you give me a description?
- It was him.
- What?
- It was him!
- Hey, hey!
- Just let me go...
Don't touch me, okay?
- What the hell is the matter with you Kyle, huh?
- Kyle!
Stop!
Stop it!
- What the fuck?
- You raped her!
You fucking raped her!
- l don't know what you're fucking talking about!
- Don't fucking lie to me!
You raped a 15-year-old girl!
- Okay, fint of all, she was 16, and I'm pretty sure that she was into it.
- You fucking raped her!
- Tomorrow, it'll be like it never happened, Kyle!
- It doesn't make it okay.
- So, what about holding up the liquor store, huh?
is that okay?
What about kidnapping the dealer, sticking a gun in his face, making him eat cow shit?
You were this close to blowing his fucking brains out, Kyle!
Now you're on some fucking guilt trip, you're gonna tell me how I can act?
I don't know why this is happening, but since it is, I'm gonna take advantage of it, okay?
And you two better stay the fuck out of my way.
- Why is this happening to us?
T:30, Halsted!
- Bob!
- What do you want, Halsted?
- It's Wednesday, right?
- Last time I checked, yeah.

- l can't believe that Charlotte was hanging out with Tiko.
No, I... I just never thought that she was-
- She was what?
Like you?
- l don't know.
- Okay, so, I have a proposition foryou.
- l don't think I want to hear this proposition.
- l stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
- How did you steal this?
- l took them from her purse like I take eveything.
- Hey, charlotte...
Hey, uh...
Look, do you want to, uh... just, um l don't want to talk to you.
- Charlotte!
Hey...
Hi. I'm Sonia.
Um...
Look, I know you think your brothers an asshole, and you're probably right, but... lt'sjust, ifyou would just let him talk to you for a minute, you would be doing me such a favour, okay?
Because I am so tired of hearing him bitch about how shitty he's been to you, and how you'll never forgive him...
Look, we're going to go get some Chinese food.
Why don't you guys come?
- Okay.
- Okay.
We can fit in the truck, right?
- Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Come in.
What colour?
- Blonde.

Did not know.
I mean, I love the blonde, but your hair... I mean, it goes so well with your eyes.
It's pretty.
- Yeah, well, we already bought the pack, and we're doing it this weekend, so...
- Should be fun.
- Oh, ho, ho!
Well, well, well... lf thisjust isn't too cute for prime time.
You girls want to get more fucked up than you've ever been in your squeam little lives?
- Put it away, Weeks.
- What, it's okay foryou to smoke meth, but it's omlimits for the rest of the family, is that it?
If it isn't the friendly neighbomood dick!
- Say that again, Weeks.
- How'd they ever let a gutless sack of shit like you become a cop anyways?
- Just keep talking.
Come on, Weeks, keep talking.
All right, you know what, that's not even remotely funny.
Look, you want to think vey carefully about what you're doing right now.
- Oh, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
I'm all thunk out.
- Mike-
- Shut the fuck up, Kyle.
I'm gonna give you three seconds to get your ugly fat ass outta here.

What the fuck are you doing?
- Hey, eveything that you're doing is gonna stay with you!
It's gonna stay with all of us!

You do not want to do this, Kyle!
:
Kyle!
- You have to do this.
- It's not gonna make any dimerence.
Nothing does.
- You have to ty.
You know, it's amazing...
The things I could justi_ just to score, you know?
Like, I'll take this from my mom, she'll never know it was gone, or... steal my sistersATM card... siphon om some cash here and there.
What's a kid need with all that money, right?
Then they...
They trashed my house 'cause of the money I owed.
And...
Beat the shit out of my little sister while I was five feet away... fucking blasted out of my mind.
- l couldn't let anyone touch me for the longest time.
- Come on, Mike...
You haven't had anything to eat or drink all day.
Me and Sonia are worried about you, man.
- Oh, you are, huh?
The mo ofyou, the thoughtful couple.
How nice.
God, she finally got to you, huh?
Did she feed you the line...
What was it?
Uh... "l couldn't let anybody touch me for the longest time?"
It's right before she grabs your cock, right?
How was she for you?
You know, I wasn't all that impressed, myself.
The biggest challenge is to find a nice place to fuck around here.
Where'd you do it?
You didn't do it, did you?
What's the matter, buddy?
!
- Look!
Mike!
Just... stop, okay?
Stop.
Let'sjust forget about this, okay?
Let'sjust forget about all this shit...
And just ty again.
Let's ty to figure this out.
There's got to be some kind of deeper meaning... to this.
- l... I just took a piss in my pants.
There's got to be some deeper meaning in that, don'tyou think?
See, look?
I'll see you this morning!
- Are you tipy yet?
- Maybe.
Aren't you supposed to be locked up somewhere?
- charlotte, I need to talk to you.
- l don't want to talk to you.
- Charlotte...
- Fuck om.
- l just thought if I could talk to her... lf l could explain...
Maybe there'sjust no point in me tying to explain the shit I did.
- Kyle, she'll come around.
- l don't know.
Are you, uh...
Are you okay about earlier?
- Yeah.
I'm vey okay.
Doesn't a part ofyou wonder if maybe he's right?
I mean, if evey good thing we do gets erased...
Evey bad thing we do gets erased...
What does it really matter what we do?
- l guess... I just need for it to matter.
T:30 Halsted!
Nice one, loser!
- Hey...
Bob, where's Mike?
- What?
- Sonia?
You know where they are?
I don't know, Halsted, having a smoke?
I don't know.
- Drop the club.
Come on, Kyle, it's a fucking club.
Drop it.
You think you can decide how I spend my repeats?
It's only fair that I retum the favour.
Take the knife.
The knife on the table, take it.
- What?
- Come on, Kyle.
Good.
Stand over there.
- Mike, what-
- Now...
Cut his throat.
- Mike, please don't do this.
- Cut his throat, or I'll put a bullet in her leg.

T:30, Halsted!
- Do you want me to come up?
- No.
I'm fine.
- You're gonna die tonight.
Don't ask me how I know, but it's true.
I've thought about what I wanted to say to you so many times.
I don't hate you anymore.
I don't, but I have to move on from this.
I have to, or else nothing's gonna change...
For any of us.
- What do you want?
Are you in trouble?
- No, I...
They let us out for a few hours.
Can l-can I come in?
I really need to talk to Charlotte.

- Are you clean?
- Yeah, Mom.
Please let me talk to her.

- l need to talk to you.
- Get the fuck out of my room.
- No.
Charlotte, no, I'm not going anywhere until you and I have talked, okay?
- We've got nothing to talk about.
Who's in the ca_
One ofyour addict friends?
- Her name's Sonia.
Yeah, I met her in rehab.
I've been thinking a lot lately...
Just about...
About what I did to you and to Mom.
- l don't want to hear this, Kyle.
- And I can't let another day pass without telling you...
VMthout telling you how sory i am.
- Fine.
Are we through now?
- Thing is,
Charlotte, I see you going down the same path that I did, and-
- You think I'm a fuck-up like you?
- No...
No, that's not what I meant.
- You don't have to watch over me.
- But I... I do.
Charlotte...
Charlotte, I do, 'Cause that's what big brothers do for their little sisters.
And I know you probably don't care right now, but...
But from now on, I'm going to be there foryou.
I'll be there foryou when it counts, because... I love you.
And...
And I'm gonna be your big brother.
T:30, Halsted!
- Sonia!
- Kyle?
- Drop it.
Drop it.
Good.
Now, I could tie you up all day, Kyle, let you wallow in your own piss, but that's not much fun.
So what we're gonna do is play a little game of hide-and-seek... with a mist.
If I find you... I'm gonna spend the rest of the day hurting you.
You've got one minute.
One minute.

Where the rooms are
A collection of our lives
Where the doors
Are moaning all day long
Where the stairs are leaning
Dusk till dawn

Where I don'tfeel alone
This is a place
That I call my home...
- Get up, Weeks.
Another day in paradise.
Breakneck speed
Tying up your hands
'Cause you're landing back on yourfeet
You know what I mean
Vowel change
I remember when our voices used to sound the same
Now we just translate
'Cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
A_erwhat you did
Born on yourfeet running
Forest fires underneath your bed
But it's good to be back
Good to be back Good to be back
Spell it out
I always skip thewords
'Cause all the pictures are so bright and loud
Better omthan now
'Cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
A_erwhat you did
Born on yourfeet running
Forest fires underneath your bed
'Cause it's good to be back
Good to be back
Super fun
At the movies drunk and young
Double knots that came undone
But the big bad years are gone
Yeah the big bad years are done
And gone away
I remember when our voices used to sound the exact same
Now wejust translate
'Cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
A_erwhat you did
Born on your feet running
Forest fires underneath your bed
But it's good to be back
Good to be back Good to be back
- 7:30, Halsted!
- Nice one, loser!
- How many's that?
- 92 and counting.
- We're supposed to get out today for a bit.
- Step nine, making amends.
Can't wait.
- Let's go.
Good morning.
- He hit on me yesterday.
- Nice one, douchebag!
- Hey, pick that up.
- Hey!
Hey!
- Come on!
- You're dead.
- All right, tough guy.
You too.
Thank you.
There you go.
I need you to sit down.
- What are you looking at, huh?
- Fuck...
Get me out of this place, please.
- I know it isn't easy, but taking that step towards reconciliation with the people most hurt by your addictions, that's the door to recovery.
Okay, we're gonna keep working at this.
This is mandatory policy now in all rehabilitation centres.
Each and every one of you will be participating.
You're gonna be getting a day pass every day this week, so get out there and make good use of your time.
Remember, don't rush, all right?
Every step is a good one...
Okay, so, I have a proposition for you.
- I don't think I want to hear this-
- I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
- Okay.
- I don't know how to...
- Are you holding it?
- Yeah, I'm holding it.
- So you put it...
- Hey, Charlotte.
No, hey, Char-
- I don't want to talk to you, Kyle.
- Charlotte, come on, I'm-I'm still your brother.
- No, I don't want to talk to him...
- Well, well.
If it isn't one of our illustrious alumni.
If you and whatever drugs you're selling aren't off the school property in the next 30 seconds,
I'm going to call the police.
- All third floor staff to the nurses' station...
- Hey, Dad.
How you doing?
- What do you want?
- Are they-are they treating you all right?
- What the fuck do you want, you little prick?
Huh?
I told you I never wanted to see you again.
You get out of my sight.
Ten years because of you, you fuckin' dope fiend.
You fuckin' coward!
If I see you again, I will fucking kill you!
If you come back here, I'll fucking kill you!
I swear, I'll kill you!
- Okay, so let's talk about today's adventures.
Kyle?
- Do I have to?
- Please.
- I went to see my sister.
- Okay, and how did that go?
- Not very well.
- Can you elaborate?
- No.
- Kyle-
- He doesn't want to talk about it.
- Talking is the only way to move forward.
- Oh, fuck you and move forward!
Fuck this whole place!
None of this makes any fucking difference to us!
- Fuck, I hate Bob.
- He's a cock.
- He's a fuckin' idiot.
It's "make amends" day.
Good to see you.
Sorry about all that money I stole.
- Yeah, sorry for ruining your life.
Oh, wait a minute, you ruined my life.
- It's all fucking bullshit anyways.
- Speaking of which.
- Sonia...
There's a call for you.
- My dad just died.
# I wish that I had known # # in that first minute we met #
# The unpayable debt #
# That I owed you #
# 'Cause you'd been abused # # by that bone that refused you #
# And you hired me # # to make up for that... #
OO this morning, an unidentified man threw himself off the Mission City dam.
Authorities believe he died on impact, but crews are still dredging the reservoir to find his body.
In Mission City...
- Fuck...
- Let's go!
7:30, Halsted!
- Nice one, loser!
- It's weird.
- What?
93, right?
- Yeah, should be 93, but... 92.
- Let's go.
Good morning.
- Nice one, douchebag!
- All right, funny guy, clean it up.
- What?
- Right now.
Right now.
- Shit...
- All of it.
- Did you guys see that?
- Fuck you, Bob.
- Get back here.
- Dick.
- Hey...
Get back here!
- That was fucking weird.
- Okay, so, I have a proposition for you.
- I don't think I want to hear this proposition.
- I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
- How did you steal this?
- I took it from her purse like I take everything, okay?
- I don't know how to...
- Okay, just hold it.
- Okay, okay, I'm holding it.
- Okay, right?
- Yeah.
- Now you have to put it to your lips like you're French.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- You'll never get that!
- All third-floor staff to the nurses' station...
- Pick up the fuckin' phone.
What?
Pick up the goddamn phone.
I told you I never wanted to see you again!
You get outta my sight!
Ten years 'cause of you!
You fuckin' dope fiend!
You fuckin' coward!
I see you again, I will fucking kill you!
If you come back here, I'll fucking kill you!
I swear, I'll kill you!
- Well, well.
If it isn't one of our illustrious alumni.
If you and whatever drugs you're selling are not off the school property in the next 30 seconds,
I'm calling the police.
- Okay, so let's talk about today's adventures.
Kyle?
- Yeah?
- What did you do today?
- Uh...
I went to see my sister.
- And how did that go for you?
- Not very well.
- Can you elaborate on that, please?
- No.
- Halsted.
Halsted.
Kyle...
Kyle...
- What the fuck is going on?
How is this even possible?
I mean...
Wait...
The storm.
Last night, the power went out, right?
I was in the rec room and I-I touched the TV.
I got this shock.
That's the last thing I remember.
- Same thing happened with me with my light.
- Weeks?
- Who cares how it happened?
The real question is, what are we gonna do with it?
- What were you doing last night?
- What were you doing?
- I was in the shower, okay?
I got shocked, too.
- Then what?
- I don't remember.
- Me neither.
- The same thing happened to all of us.
- Fuck, I'm gonna get that call again.
- Uh, Sonia, there's a call for you.
- Exactly the same.
- You all right?
- Shouldn't we be doing something?
We just lived through the same day twice.
Are we just gonna sit here and waste it?
- Last night, on the news...
There's-there's a jumper at the dam.
Let's go.
Let's do it.
- What about curfew?
- Fuck curfew.
- Shit, we gotta stop him.
- No, it's...
It's too late.
- Couldn't sleep.
- Me neither.
At least you went to see him.
- I didn't.
- I thought you went to the hospital.
- I went to the hospital, but...
I just couldn't go into his room.
- What do you think'd happen if we just...
Stayed in here all night?
- Trouble for sure.
- Then I'm not leaving.
- Why do you think this is happening to us?
- Sorry.
- No, it's...
It's okay.
7:30, Halsted!
- Bob!
- What?
- What day is it?
Last time I checked, it was Wednesday.
- Look, we're gonna figure this out.
- We're not gonna figure out shit, okay?
We're gonna keep repeating the same day over and over again until we go completely out of our fucking minds.
- Okay, but, look, we each had the same shock of electricity or whatever, right?
So...
- So, what?
So maybe that's something that we do?
- Okay, you go and electrocute yourself then, sister, but I'm gonna enjoy it while I got it.
God, what is that girl's problem?
You know, ifyou think about it, it doesn't really matter what we do today.
Right?
I mean, I could take a piss in group.
As a matter of fact, I could just piss on Bob.
Tomorrow, it'd be like it never happened.
- Yeah.
I don't know, man.
I... just feel like we shouldn't mess with it, you know?
- What do you think we should do with it?
- I don't know.
- Pull it out and put it back.
What?
- The bottle of gin.
I can see it in your pants.
Pull it out and put it back!
- It's not in my pants.
- What do you call that?
Put it back!
You know what, both of you, get the hell out of my store!
Both of you, get out!
Idiots!
- Feeling better?
- Oh, starting to.
- What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
Oh, no, dude.
We'd better pray tomomow repeats.
Fuck!
You're sick!
Sick!
Oh, Bobby...
Whoa, Bob likes pussy.
Who am I?
Who am I?
Bob... loves... lady cock.
- What the fuck?
- Oh, no...
Nearly Legal.
Nearly Legal.
Fuck, look.
Oh, fuck.
- All right, freeze, boys!
Party's over.
Hands on your head.
Let's go, right now.
Hands on your head.
That's it.
Looks like you screwed up royally this time, eh, Weeks, huh?
Just like the old man, huh?
Hands behind your back.
Halsted.
Your mom posted bail.
- See you this morning.
- Well...
Looks like no daddy coming for you, cowboy.
- Breaking and entering?
Vandalism?
Your first day pass and that's what you do with it, huh?
Well, you must be really proud of yourself.
You have any idea what that little exercise just cost me?
Kyle...
OO this morning, an unidentified man threw himself off the Mission City dam...
- It's weird.
I was scared, but...
At the same time, I felt... really alive.
- What if it doesn't repeat?
You're gonna have a criminal record on top of your drug histoy.
That's pretty awesome, Halsted.
7:30, Halsted!
- Hey, Bob?
Bob...
I hear there's been a few break-ins in the neighbourhood lately?
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Nothing.
- Okay, come on, let's go.
Get your ass in gear.
- Hello.
- Well, hello.
Again.
- Every time.
- Let's go.
- Bob, lookin' slick.
Morning.
Nice one, douchebag.
So, what's on the program?
- Clean it up.
Right now.
- You know,
I think our man, Bob, on his down time, he likes to just settle in with a little bit of Victoria gin.
- Victoria gin?
- Yeah, yeah, a little bit of lubrication before he kicks off his shoes, and he thumbs through his favorite magazine...
Nearly Legal!
- Right, Bob?
- I knew he was a pig.
- Oh, not to worry, Logan.
I think you're a bit too old for him now.
- Fuck you.
- Well, fuck it, cowpokes, let's celebrate!
- Yeah.
- Yeah!
- Three more!
Here!
Baby, baby, baby, baby...
- Woo!
- Are you gonna be able to pay for all this?
- Oh, you bet your sweet ass, girl.
- All right, yeah, I'm gonna need you to settle up.
- I apologize.
He hasn't gotten laid in a bit.
- A very long time.
You want to help me out with that?
- Oh...
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
That there male and that there female are gonna pay for me.
- I have no money.
- Fuck sakes...
- I'm so sorry!
- Okay, thanks, partner, that was great!
All right, uh, I'm gonna sing a little song to pay for some drinks.
- Woo!
- Yeah, that's right, pal!
And I'm gonna dedicate it to my to friends.
Y'all know who you are...
- It's us!
We're his friends!
Oh, my darlin' oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin' Clementine
- Let him sing!
Hey, let him sing!
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin' Clementine...
- Where did you get this from?
- What was that noise?
And?
- Oh, that is...
Mine stinks, dude.
- Milady?
- Oh, shit.
Wow.
- My friend.
One for you.
- Oh, my G...
Are we really gonna do this?
- Tell me you haven't always wanted to knock of a liquor store?
- Are these things clean?
- What?
- Well, they jam if they're dirty, right?
We're not going to shoot anybody.
Okay, you know what, the only thing that my old man cares about more than his knife collection is his fucking gun collection.
So yeah, they're clean.
Let's do this, kiddies!
Oink!
Oink!
Stick your hands up!
It's a stick-up!
Let's go!
- Try to touch my dick and I'll blow your fuckin' brains out!
Go!
- Shit...
- Open the fuckin' register!
- Okay.
- You think this is fuckin' funny?
Hurry up!
Get me a bag, fuck!
Quick!
Here...
- What the fuck?
- Shit, there's a car!
- What?
- There's a car, fuck!
Hurry up!
- Let's go!
- Hurry!
- Let's go, come on!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Oh, my God, what the fuck?
- How much did we get?
- I don't know, man.
There's like 500 bucks here and 42 pennies.
I took it all, man.
I took it all.
Shit...
- Yo, Tiko, what's up, man?
- Well, if it isn't my favourite customer, man.
Long time, no show, bro.
- Yeah, man.
Look, um...
Michelle?
Charlotte?
Tiko, what the fuck, man?
Tell me you didn't get my sister fuckin' high.
- That's not all we did, G.
- Hey...
- Charlotte!
- Easy!
Fuck...
Jesus...
We good?
Nobody in there wants to talk to you.
Okay, man?
So just fuck off.
- Fuck you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- There's room for you.
- Nice fuckin' sweatpants.
- Don't worry, guys.
I know a guy that we can score from.
Welcome to my drug of choice, kiddies.
- This shit always fuckin' scared me.
- They say you're addicted the moment you take your first hit.
Only today...
You get to be unaddicted again.
Here it comes.
Go, go, go, go, go.
# ...ain't gonna cure you #
# Honey time's just gonna # # hit on you #
# You got to #
# You got to go steal ahead #
# You got to go steal ahead #
# You got to # # You got to go steal ahead... #
Fuck me.
# You've got to # # You got to go steal ahead #
# Uh-huh... #
You know, your sister's little friend, she's pretty hot.
- Yeah, she's also 15 fucking years old, dude.
- Nearly Legal!
I mean, she is fuckin' hot, though.
# Time's just gonna hit on you #
# I said #
# Six kinds of glue #
# Won't hold you #
# Won't hold you #
# Oh my oh #
# Oh my you've got to # # You got to you got to you got to... #
# Go steal ahead # # Go steal ahead... #
- Hold the fuck on!
What?
- Grab his legs.
- Jesus...
Fuck, he's heavy.
- Fuck...
- God, Tiko...
- Get on your knees.
Get on your fuckin' knees!
- Okay, okay...
We were just having some fun, man.
I didn't-I didn't-
- Shut the fuck up!
- Okay, okay, okay...
Come on, man.
- Pick that up.
- What?
- Pick that up.
- No, man.
Fuck you, man!
- Pick that up, you fuck!
- Fuck...
I didn't touch your fucking sister, man!
- Pick it fucking up!
- Don't make me fucking do this, man.
Don't make me do it, man...
- Fuck.
Don't fucking cy, just fuckin' pick it up.
No...
- Mm-hmm.
Now take a bite.
Take a bite, Tiko...
- Fuck you, man!
I didn't touch your fucking sister, man!
You're all going to fucking jail!
Fuck you!
- All right, kiddies, let's go.
- It's okay.
Woo!
- Time to up the ante!
If you slip?
Bang!
Wake up in bed like it's a bad dream.
- Yeah, that's assuming we have another repeat.
- Hmm, if we don't...
Make sure they burry me with my boots on.
- Jesus...
- Hey, Mike, come on, man.
- Shh...
Kyle...
You're gonna mess up my concentration.
Ah...
Who's next?
Huh?
- Hey...
- What?
- What are you doing?
You're ripped out of your mind.
We still don't even know if we're gonna repeat.
We can't fuck around like this.
- I'm okay.
It's okay.
- Oh, who is this girl?
There you go, girl.
Rip that pole.
Oh, one foot, one foot-
- Fuck off, Weeks!
- Woo!
I saw a smile!
- Stop it!
- I won't say another word...
- No!
- Don't let go!
Weeks!
Weeks, help me!
- No!
- You're fuckin' dead!
You're fucking dead, you fuck!
Fuck you!
- See you this morning!
- Fuck you!
You're fucking dead!
7:30, Halsted.
- You should get some hashbrowns before they're all gone.
- Nice one, loser!
- Never realized how much I loved the hashbrowns.
- Jesus...
- Yeah.
Only it took him three days to rise from the dead.
- Good morning.
- Okay, you died last night.
I saw you die.
- What was it like?
Do you... remember anything?
- I just remember right before, and then...
It's blank.
You know, I've thought about suicide before, but...
I mean, right in that moment, right before it happened,
I...
Can't believe how bad I wanted to live.
- We have to stop.
Right now.
- What?
- If today hadn't repeated...
- But it did repeat, and it looks like it's gonna keep on repeating.
- Yeah, w-we're tempting fate.
- We just gotta figure something out, okay?
We gotta get out of this somehow.
- You've got to be fucking kidding me.
This is a fucking gift.
We can do anything we want, anything.
It's your fuckin' loss.
- Don't you think it's kind of weird that all this stuff happens on the same day your dad dies?
- My dad used to force himself on me.
And a-at first, I-I didn't know what to do.
I mean, I...
I didn't even know what he was doing.
And as I got older,
I would fight back, but...
Never seemed to stop it.
So, I mean, I-I don't know what...
What, I'm supposed to give him some sort of peace of mind for that?
- Here we go.
No!
- No, no, no!
Don't!
Don't!
No!
- Fuck off!
- No!
- You don't want to do this!
- Who are you?
- You don't want to do this.
Look at me.
- Let go of me!
- You don't want to do this.
- Please let me go, please let me go.
Please...
- It's okay...
Please let me go...
- The news said it was a man, but...
It was a girl.
Just a girl.
- I know, she's, like, the same age as me.
- Maybe that's what we're supposed to be doing.
You know, maybe we're supposed to be helping people.
- She's still going to be there again tomorrow.
- He grabbed me, and I tried, and I said stop, and he wouldn't, and I...
- Okay, we'll get you another jacket.
- Copy that.
We'll bring her in for an assessment.
Get all the necessary tests.
- What's going on?
- A girl got attacked.
- I need a description.
- I don't know what he looked like!
- Do you know who did this to you?
- Don't touch me!
- Can you give me a description?
- It was him.
- What?
- It was him!
- Hey, hey!
- Just let me go...
Don't touch me, okay?
- What the hell is the matter with you Kyle, huh?
- Kyle!
Stop!
Stop it!
- What the fuck?
- You raped her!
You fucking raped her!
- I don't know what you're fucking talking about!
- Don't fucking lie to me!
You raped a 15-year-old girl!
- Okay, first of all, she was 16, and I'm pretty sure that she was into it.
- You fucking raped her!
- Tomorrow, it'll be like it never happened, Kyle!
- It doesn't make it okay.
- So, what about holding up the liquor store, huh?
Is that okay?
What about kidnapping the dealer, sticking a gun in his face, making him eat cow shit?
You were this close to blowing his fucking brains out, Kyle!
Now you're on some fucking guilt trip, you're gonna tell me how I can act?
I don't know why this is happening, but since it is, I'm gonna take advantage of it, okay?
And you two better stay the fuck out of my way.
- Why is this happening to us?
7:30, Halsted!
- Bob!
- What do you want, Halsted?
- It's Wednesday, right?
- Last time I checked, yeah.
- Nice one, loser!
- I can't believe that Charlotte was hanging out with Tiko.
No, I...
I just never thought that she was-
- She was what?
Like you?
- I don't know.
- Okay, so, I have a proposition for you.
- I don't think I want to hear this proposition.
- I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
- How did you steal this?
- I took them from her purse like I take everything.
- Hey, Charlotte...
Hey, uh...
Look, do you want to, uh... just, um...
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Charlotte!
Hey...
Hi.
I'm Sonia.
Um...
Look, I know you think your brother's an asshole, and you're probably right, but... it's just, if you would just let him talk to you for a minute, you would be doing me such a favour, okay?
Because I am so tired of hearing him bitch about how shitty he's been to you, and how you'll never forgive him...
Look, we're going to go get some Chinese food.
Why don't you guys come?
- Okay.
- Okay.
We can fit in the truck, right?
- Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Come in.
What color?
- Blonde.
- You're gonna go blonde?
- Yeah.
- No...
Did not know.
I mean, I love the blonde, but your hair...
I mean, it goes so well with your eyes.
It's pretty.
- Yeah, well, we already bought the pack, and we're doing it this weekend, so...
- Should be fun.
- Oh, ho, ho!
Well, well, well...
If this just isn't too cute for prime time.
You girls want to get more fucked up than you've ever been in your squeaky little lives?
- Put it away, Weeks.
- What, it's okay for you to smoke meth, but it's off limits for the rest of the family, is that it?
If it isn't the friendly neighborhood dick!
- Say that again, Weeks.
- How'd they ever let a gutless sack of shit like you become a cop anyways?
- Just keep talking.
Come on, Weeks, keep talking.
All right, you know what, that's not even remotely funny.
Look, you want to think very carefully about what you're doing right now.
- Oh, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
I'm all thunk out.
- Mike-
- Shut the fuck up, Kyle.
I'm gonna give you three seconds to get your ugly fat ass outta here.
One...
Hand away from the gun, Gerald.
Hand away from the gun.
There you go, there you go.
Two...
Fucking mess with me!
Yeah, no daddy coming for you!
Fuck off!
You don't know what you're missing.
- You guys okay?
Hey...
You okay?
Charlotte, you okay?
You all right?
You okay?
7:30, Halsted!
- What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
- Hey, everything that you're doing is gonna stay with you!
It's gonna stay with all of us!
- No, Kyle!
You do not want to do this, Kyle!
Kyle!
- You have to do this.
- It's not gonna make any difference.
Nothing does.
- You have to try.
You know, it's amazing...
The things I could justify just to score, you know?
Like, I'll take this from my mom, she'll never know it was gone, or... steal my sister's ATM card... siphon off some cash here and there.
What's a kid need with all that money, right?
Then they...
They trashed my house 'cause of the money I owed.
And...
Beat the shit out of my little sister while I was five feet away... fucking blasted out of my mind.
- I couldn't let anyone touch me for the longest time.
- Come on, Mike...
You haven't had anything to eat or drink all day.
Me and Sonia are worried about you, man.
- Oh, you are, huh?
The two of you, the thoughtful couple.
How nice.
God, she finally got to you, huh?
Did she feed you the line...
What was it?
Uh... "I couldn't let anybody touch me for the longest time?"
It's right before she grabs your cock, right?
How was she for you?
You know, I wasn't all that impressed, myself.
The biggest challenge is to find a nice place to fuck around here.
Where'd you do it?
You didn't do it, did you?
What's the matter, buddy?
!
- Look!
Mike!
Just... stop, okay?
Stop.
Let's just forget about this, okay?
Let's just forget about all this shit...
And just try again.
Let's try to figure this out.
There's got to be some kind of deeper meaning... to this.
- I...
I just took a piss in my pants.
There's got to be some deeper meaning in that, don't you think?
See, look?
I 'll see you this morning!
- Are you tipsy yet?
- Maybe.
Aren't you supposed to be locked up somewhere?
- Charlotte, I need to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Charlotte...
- Fuck off.
- I just thought if I could talk to her... if I could explain...
Maybe there's just no point in me trying to explain the shit I did.
- Kyle, she'll come around.
- I don't know.
Are you, uh...
Are you okay about earlier?
- Yeah.
I'm very okay.
Doesn't a part of you wonder if maybe he's right?
I mean, if every good thing we do gets erased...
Every bad thing we do gets erased...
What does it really matter what we do?
- I guess...
I just need for it to matter.
7:30 Halsted!
- Nice one, loser!
- Hey...
Bob, where's Mike?
- What?
- Sonia?
You know where they are?
I don't know, Halsted, having a smoke?
I don't know.
- Drop the club.
Come on, Kyle, it's a fucking club.
Drop it.
You think you can decide how I spend my repeats?
It's only fair that I return the favor.
Take the knife.
The knife on the table, take it.
- What?
- Come on, Kyle.
Good.
Stand over there.
- Mike, what...
- Now...
Cut his throat.
- Mike, please don't do this.
- Cut his throat, or I'll put a bullet in her leg.
I kid you not, Kyle.
I will put a hole in her leg the size of a fucking grapefruit.
Do it, or I'll put a bullet in her head!
- You're fucked!
- That's right, get angy!
Get motherfucking feral!
Cut his fucking throat!
Welcome to the club, Kyle.
- You're okay...
Come on, come on.
All right...
- We'll have fun...
- I'm okay.
Come on, what's wrong?
Come on...
- No, I'm okay.
I'm okay.
- Fuck!
- Get the fuck up!
Get up, you fucking piece of shit.
- I knew you had it in you.
I'm gonna give you three seconds to get lost.
- Fuck you.
See you this morning, Kyle.
7:30, Halsted!
- Do you want me to come up?
- No.
I'm fine.
- You're gonna die tonight.
Don't ask me how I know, but it's true.
I've thought about what I wanted to say to you so many times.
I don't hate you anymore.
I don't, but I have to move on from this.
I have to, or else nothing's gonna change...
For any of us.
- What do you want?
Are you in trouble?
- No, I...
They let us out for a few hours.
Can I-can I come in?
I really need to talk to Charlotte.
- I-I really don't think it's a good idea.
- Mom, I really need to talk to her.
- Are you clean?
- Yeah, Mom.
Please let me talk to her.
- Okay.
- Residents are reeling tonight over the death of two local police officers in what's shaping up to be a double homicide.
The suspect is described as a Caucasian male in his early 20s...
- Charlotte?
- What are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.
- Get the fuck out of my room.
- No.
Charlotte, no, I'm not going anywhere until you and I have talked, okay?
- We've got nothing to talk about.
Who's in the car?
One of your addict friends?
- Her name's Sonia.
Yeah, I met her in rehab.
I've been thinking a lot lately...
Just about...
About what I did to you and to mom.
- I don't want to hear this, Kyle.
- And I can't let another day pass without telling you...
Without telling you how sorry I am.
- Fine.
Are we through now?
- Thing is,
Charlotte, I see you going down the same path that I did, and...
- You think I'm a fuck-up like you?
- No...
No, that's not what vmeant.
- You don't have to watch over me.
- But I...
I do.
Charlotte...
Charlotte, I do, 'Cause that's what big brothers do for their little sisters.
And I know you probably don't care right now, but...
But from now on, I'm going to be there for you.
I'll be there for you when it counts, because...
I love you.
And...
And I'm gonna be your big brother.
7:30, Halsted!
- Sonia!
- Kyle?
- Drop it.
Drop it.
Good.
Now, I could tie you up all day, Kyle, let you wallow in your own piss, but that's not much fun.
So what we're gonna do is play a little game of hide-and-seek... with a twist.
If I find you...
I'm gonna spend the rest of the day hurting you.
You've got one minute.
One minute.
- You okay?
- Other door.
One...
- Come on!
- ...two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten...
- Come on, come on...
- One minute!
- There!
There!
This way!
Yeah!
- Woo!
- Come on.
Come on...
- Come on out, kiddies, I ain't got all day.
Come on out!
- Come on.
Come on!
Come on...
Come on, come on...
Go!
Come on!
Go!
- Are you guys having fun yet?
You know, the last rehab place I went to...
They had us act out horrible events from our past.
What do you say, Logan?
You could be nine years old again.
I could play daddy!
Or maybe Kyle could play daddy since he can't stop fucking you!
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Go.
Go!
Go!
- Hey...
Hey, kid!
Hey, you all right?
- It doesn't snow today.
What day is it?
I said, what day is it?
!
Oh, fuck...
- How are you doing?
- I'm fine.
I just got a tetanus shot and some stitches.
Where is he?
- No one's seen him.
- We need you to come with us.
- Get your fucking head down on the floor!
If you two fucking move,
I will put a fucking bullet in your head, do you hear me?
I'll fucking kill you.
I will fucking kill you.
- Mom?
I'm sorry.
- Lieutenant, this is Kyle Halsted and Sonia Logan.
- So I understand you've been brought up to speed?
- Yeah.
- Most important thing is you keep him calm.
- Gimme the phone, come on.
Hurry up!
Hello?
- I have your friend right here.
- Mike?
- Kyle.
- Mike, man, y-you didn't know.
You thought the day was gonna repeat again, right?
You thought you had a clean slate.
You didn't know.
- You think a jury's gonna fuckin' believe that?
- Mike...
We can fix this.
We got into this together, right?
So we can fix it together.
- You guys turned on me, man.
You should've let it go.
You should've let it run its course.
You should have had my back, Kyle!
Mike...
Please...
Don't do this, man.
Don't take it out on them.
Please, man, don't do this to Charlotte.
Mike?
Mike!
- Okay, we're going to have to go inside.
- No, no, let me try again, I can...
- Listen, this kid has killed two people already.
Come with me.
Hey, hey, hey!
- No, no, Kyle, don't!
- Stand down!
Everybody, stand down!
- Mike?
- Kyle, you die now, you die for keeps.
- Mike, I'm coming up, man.
Mike, you gotta let 'em go.
- Nobody move.
Nobody fucking move!
Stay still and shut up!
- Mike!
That's my sister.
That's my baby sister and I'm not gonna let you hurt her, okay?
- I'm warning you, Kyle.
Stay where you are.
- Mike...
It's over.
- Stop.
- Just give me the gun.
- Stop.
- I was never gonna make amends with my old man.
I never was, and I never will.
It doesn't matter how many days repeat!
- Give me the gun.
- That's the difference between you and me, right?
- Mike!
Shh, shh... lt's okay, it's okay...
Shh, shh...
Shh...
Shh, it's okay.
- You okay?
- Yeah.

(Pounding on door)
- 7:30, Halsted!
(Chattering)
- Nice one, loser!
- How many's that?
- 92 and counting.
- We're supposed to get out today for a bit.
- Step nine, making amends.
Can't wait.
- Let's go.
Good morning.
- He hit on me yesterday.
(Scoffing)
- Nice one, douche bag!
(Cackling)
- Hey, pick that up.
- Hey!
Hey!
- Come on!
- You're dead.
- All right, tough guy.
You too.
Thank you.
There you go.
I need you to sit down.
- What are you looking at, huh?
- Fuck...
Get me out of this place, please.
- I know it isn't easy, but taking that step towards reconciliation with the people most hurt by your addictions, that's the door to recovery.
Okay, we're gonna keep working at this.
This is mandatory policy now in all rehabilitation cent res.
Each and every one of you will be participating.
You're gonna be getting a day pass every day this week, so get out there and make good use of your time.
Remember, don't rush, all right?
Every step is a good one... (school bell ringing)
- Okay, so, I have a proposition for you.
- I don't think I want to hear this--
- I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
- Okay.
- I don't know how to--
- Are you holding it?
- Yeah, I'm holding it.
- So you put it...
- Hey, Charlotte.
No, hey, Char-
- I don't want to talk to you, Kyle.
- Charlotte, come on, I'm-I'm still your brother.
- No, I don't want to talk to him...
- Well, well.
If it isn't one of our illustrious alumni.
If you and whatever drugs you're selling aren't off the school property in the next 30 seconds,
I'm going to call the police.
(Engine revving)
(tires screeching)
(monitors beeping)
- All third-floor staff to the nurses' station...
- Hey, Dad.
How you doing?
- What do you want?
- Are they-are they treating you all right?
(Impatient banging)
- What the fuck do you want, you little prick?
Huh?
(Banging on glass)
I told you I never wanted to see you again.
You get out of my sight.
Ten years because of you, you fuckin' dope fiend.
You fuckin' coward!
(Loud banging)
If I see you again, I will fucking kill you!
If you come back here, I'll fucking kill you!
I swear, I'll kill you!
- Okay, so let's talk about today's adventures.
Kyle?
- Do I have to?
- Please.
(Heavy sighing)
- I went to see my sister.
- Okay, and how did that go?
- Not very well.
- Can you elaborate?
- No.
- Kyle-
- He doesn't want to talk about it.
- Talking is the only way to move forward.
- Oh, fuck you and move forward!
Fuck this whole place!
None of this makes any fucking difference to us!
(Chair slamming)
- Fuck, I hate Bob.
- He's a cock.
- He's a fuckin' idiot.
It's "make amends" day.
Good to see you.
Sorry about all that money I stole.
- Yeah, sorry for ruining your life.
Oh, wait a minute, you ruined my life.
- It's all fucking bullshit anyways.
- Speaking of which.
- Sonia...
There's a call for you.
- My dad just died.
(Lighter flicking)
(soft music)
¢Ü I wish that I had known ¢Ü
¢Ü In that first minute we met ¢Ü
¢Ü The unpayable debt ¢Ü
¢Ü That I owed you ¢Ü
¢Ü 'Cause you'd been abused by that bone that refused you ¢Ü
¢Ü And you hired me to make up for that... ¢Ü
(crying)
- Just after 11 :00 this morning, an unidentified man threw himself off the Mission City dam.
Authorities believe he died on impact, but crews are still dredging the reservoir to find his body.
In Mission City... (music intensifying) (thunder rumbling)
(bulb shattering)
- Fuck...
(switch flicking)
(electricity crackling)
(humming)
(knocking insistently)
- Let's go!
(Humming)
(pounding on door) 7:30, Halsted!
- Nice one, loser!
- It's weird.
- What?
93, right?
- Yeah, should be 93, but... 92.
- Let's go.
Good morning.
- Nice one, douche bag!
(Cackling)
- All right, funny guy, clean it up.
- What?
- Right now.
Right now.
- Shit...
- All of it.
- Did you guys see that?
- Fuck you, Bob.
- Get back here.
- Dick.
- Hey...
Get back here!
- That was fucking weird.
(Buzzer blaring)
(school bell ringing)
- Okay, so, I have a proposition for you.
- I don't think I want to hear this proposition.
- I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
- How did you steal this?
- I took it from her purse like I take everything, okay?
- I don't know how to--
- Okay, just hold it.
- Okay, okay, I'm holding it.
- Okay, right?
- Yeah.
- Now you have to put it to your lips like you're French.
- Okay.
- Okay.
(Giggling)
- You'll never get that!
(Monitors beeping)
- All third-floor staff to the nurses' station...
- Pick up the fuckin' phone.
What?
Pick up the goddamn phone.
(Banging impatiently)
I told you I never wanted to see you again!
You get outta my sight!
10 years 'cause of you!
You fuckin' dope fiend!
(Loud banging)
You fuckin' coward!
I see you again, I will fucking kill you!
If you come back here, I'll fucking kill you!
I swear, I'll kill you!
- Well, well.
If it isn't one of our illustrious alumni.
If you and whatever drugs you're selling are not off the school property in the next 30 seconds,
I'm calling the police.
(Engine starting)
(security buzzer blaring)
- Okay, so let's talk about today's adventures.
Kyle?
- Yeah?
- What did you do today?
- Uh...
I went to see my sister.
(Laughing)
- And how did that go for you?
- Not very well.
(Laughing)
- Can you elaborate on that, please?
- No.
- Halsted.
Halsted.
Kyle... (voice echoing dreamily):
Kyle...
- What the fuck is going on?
How is this even possible?
I mean...
Wait...
The storm.
Last night, the power went out, right?
I was in the rec room and I-I touched the TV.
I got this shock.
That's the last thing I remember.
- Same thing happened with me with my light.
- Weeks?
- Who cares how it happened?
The real question is, what are we gonna do with it?
- What were you doing last night?
- What were you doing?
- I was in the shower, okay?
I got shocked, too.
- Then what?
- I don't remember.
- Me neither.
- The same thing happened to all of us.
- Fuck, I'm gonna get that call again.
(Door opening)
- Uh, Sonia, there's a call for you.
- Exactly the same.
- You all right?
- Shouldn't we be doing something?
We just lived through the same day twice.
Are we just gonna sit here and waste it?
- Last night, on the news...
There's-there's a jumper at the dam.
Let's go.
Let's do it.
- What about curfew?
- Fuck curfew.
- Shit, we gotta stop him.
- No, it's...
It's too late.
(Sonia sighs.)
(thunder rumbling)
- Couldn't sleep.
- Me neither.
At least you went to see him.
- I didn't.
- I thought you went to the hospital.
- I went to the hospital, but...
I just couldn't go into his room.
- What do you think'd happen if we just...
Stayed in here all night?
- Trouble for sure.
- Then I'm not leaving.
(Chuckling)
- Why do you think this is happening to us?
- Sorry.
- No, it's...
It's okay.
- 7:30, Halsted!
- Bob!
- What?
- What day is it?
Last time I checked, it was Wednesday.
- Look, we're gonna figure this out.
- We're not gonna figure out shit, okay?
We're gonna keep repeating the same day over and over again until we go completely out of our fucking minds.
- Okay, but, look, we each had the same shock of electricity or whatever, right?
So...
- So, what?
So maybe that's something that we do?
- Okay, you go and electrocute yourself then, sister, but I'm gonna enjoy it while I got it.
(Quietly):
God, what is that girl's problem?
You know, if you think about it, it doesn't really matter what we do today.
Right?
I mean, I could take a piss in group.
As a matter of fact, I could just piss on Bob.
Tomorrow, it'd be like it never happened.
- Yeah.
I don't know, man.
I... just feel like we shouldn't mess with it, you know?
- What do you think we should do with it?
- I don't know.
(Laughing)
- Pull it out and put it back.
(Laughing):
What?
- The bottle of gin.
I can see it in your pants.
Pull it out and put it back!
- It's not in my pants.
- What do you call that?
Put it back!
You know what, both of you, get the hell out of my store!
Both of you, get out!
Idiots!
(Laughing)
- Feeling better?
- Oh, starting to.
- What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
Oh, no, dude.
We'd better pray tomorrow repeats.
(Engine roaring to life) (laughing)
Fuck!
(Whooping in excitement)
(laughing)
(tires squealing)
You're sick!
Sick!
Oh, Bobby... (heavy metal music)
Whoa, Bob likes pussy.
Who am I?
Who am I?
(Humming)
Bob... loves... lady cock.
(Laughing)
- What the fuck?
- Oh, no...
Nearly Legal.
Nearly Legal.
Fuck, look.
(Laughing) Oh, fuck.
- All right, freeze, boys!
Party's over.
Hands on your head.
Let's go, right now.
Hands on your head.
That's it.
Looks like you screwed up royally this time, eh, Weeks, huh?
Just like the old man, huh?
Hands behind your back.
(Laughing)
Halsted.
Your mom posted bail.
- See you this morning.
- Well...
Looks like no daddy coming for you, cowboy.
- Breaking and entering?
Vandalism?
Your first day pass and that's what you do with it, huh?
Well, you must be really proud of yourself.
You have any idea what that little exercise just cost me?
Kyle...
- Just after 11:00 this morning, an unidentified man threw himself off the Mission City dam--
(heavy sighing)
- It's weird.
I was scared, but...
At the same time, I felt... really alive.
- What if it doesn't repeat?
You're gonna have a criminal record on top of your drug history.
That's pretty awesome, Halsted.
(Pounding on door) - 7:30, Halsted!
- Hey, Bob?
Bob...
I hear there's been a few break-ins in the neighbourhood lately?
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Nothing.
- Okay, come on, let's go.
Get your ass in gear.
(Chattering)
- Hello.
- Well, hello.
(Chuckling)
Again.
- Every time.
- Let's go.
- Bob, look in' slick.
(Awkwardly):
Morning.
(Laughing)
(quietly):
Nice one, douche bag.
(Tray clattering)
(laughing)
So, what's on the program?
- Clean it up.
Right now.
- You know,
I think our man, Bob, on his down time, he likes to just settle in with a little bit of Victoria gin.
- Victoria gin?
- Yeah, yeah, a little bit of lubrication before he kicks off his shoes, and he thumbs through his favorite magazine... (chanting together):
Nearly Legal!
- Right, Bob?
(Laughter)
- I knew he was a pig.
- Oh, not to worry, Logan.
I think you're a bit too old for him now.
- Fuck you.
(Laughing)
- Well, fuck it, cowpokes, let's celebrate!
- Yeah.
(Country music)
(screaming)
- Yeah!
- Three more!
Here!
Baby, baby, baby, baby...
- Woo!
- Are you gonna be able to pay for all this?
- Oh, you bet your sweet ass, girl.
- All right, yeah, I'm gonna need you to settle up.
- I apologize.
He hasn't gotten laid in a bit.
- A very long time.
You want to help me out with that?
- Oh...
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
That there male and that there female are gonna pay for me.
- I have no money.
- Fuck sakes...
- I'm so sorry!
- Okay, thanks, partner, that was great!
All right, uh, I'm gonna sing a little song to pay for some drinks.
- Woo!
- Yeah, that's right, pal!
And I'm gonna dedicate it to my two friends.
Y'all know who you are-
- It's us!
We're his friends!
Oh, my darlin' oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin' Clementine
- Let him sing!
Hey, let him sing!
(Car horns blaring) (laughing hysterically)
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin' Clementine... (laughing)
(Weeks making goofy noises.)
- Where did you get this from?
- What was that noise?
(Laughing)
And?
(Oinking)
- Oh, that is--
Mine stinks, dude.
- Milady?
- Oh, shit.
Wow.
- My friend.
One for you.
- Oh, my G--
Are we really gonna do this?
- Tell me you haven't always wanted to knock off a liquor store?
- Are these things clean?
- What?
- Well, they jam if they're dirty, right?
(Laughing):
We're not going to shoot anybody.
Okay, you know what, the only thing that my old man cares about more than his knife collection is his fucking gun collection.
So yeah, they're clean.
Let's do this, kiddies!
Oink!
Oink!
(Rock music)
Stick your hands up!
It's a stick-up!
Let's go!
- Try to touch my dick and I'll blow your fuckin' brains out!
Go!
(Laughing)
- Shit...
- Open the fuckin' register!
- Okay.
- You think this is fuckin' funny?
Hurry up!
Get me a bag, fuck!
Quick!
Here...
- What the fuck?
(Laughing)
- Shit, there's a car!
- What?
- There's a car, fuck!
Hurry up!
- Let's go!
- Hurry!
- Let's go, come on!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
(Laughing)
(song playing)
(laughing) (indistinct conversation)
Oh, my God, what the fuck?
(Laughing in triumph)
- How much did we get?
- I don't know, man.
There's like 500 bucks here and 42 pennies.
(Laughing) I took it all, man.
I took it all.
(Wailing sirens approaching)
Shit... (laughing)
(knocking)
(knocking on door)
- Yo, Tiko, what's up, man?
- Well, if it isn't my favourite customer, man.
Long time, no show, bro.
- Yeah, man.
Look, um...
Michelle?
Charlotte?
Tiko, what the fuck, man?
Tell me you didn't get my sister fuckin' high.
- That's not all we did, G.
- Hey...
- Charlotte!
- Easy!
Fuck...
Jesus...
We good?
Nobody in there wants to talk to you.
Okay, man?
So just fuck off.
- Fuck you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- There's room for you.
- Nice fuckin' sweatpants.
(Laughing)
- Don't worry, guys.
I know a guy that we can score from.
Welcome to my drug of choice, kiddies.
- This shit always fuckin' scared me.
- They say you're addicted the moment you take your first hit.
Only today...
You get to be unaddicted again.
(Sighing)
Here it comes.
Go, go, go, go, go.
(Exhaling shakily)

(Giggling)

- God, Tiko...
- Get on your knees.
Get on your fuckin' knees!
- Okay, okay...
We were just having some fun, man.
I didn't-I didn't-
- Shut the fuck up!
- Okay, okay, okay... (whispering):
Come on, man.
- Pick that up.
- What?
(Gunshot)
- Pick that up.
- No, man.
Fuck you, man!
- Pick that up, you fuck!
- Fuck...
I didn't touch your fucking sister, man!
- Pick it fucking up!
- Don't make me fucking do this, man.
Don't make me do it, man...
- Fuck.
Don't fucking cry, just fuckin' pick it up.
(Sobbing):
No...
(whimpering)
- Mm-h mm.
Now take a bite.
(Sniveling)
Take a bite, Tiko...
(sobbing)
(gagging and retching)
(sobbing)
- Fuck you, man!
I didn't touch your fucking sister, man!
(Sobbing)
You're all going to fucking jail!
Fuck you!
(Sobbing)
(giggling)
- All right, kiddies, let's go.
- It's okay.
Woo!
(Whooping with excitement)
- Time to up the ante!
If you slip?
Bang!
Wake up in bed like it's a bad dream.
- Yeah, that's assuming we have another repeat.
- Hmm, if we don't...
Make sure they bury me with my boots on.
(Gasping)
- Jesus... (laughing)
- Hey, Mike, come on, man.
- Shh...
Kyle...
You're gonna mess up my concentration.
(Laughing)
(water roaring)
(laughing)
Ah...
Who's next?
Huh?
- Hey...
- What?
- What are you doing?
You're ripped out of your mind.
We still don't even know if we're gonna repeat.
We can't fuck around like this.
- I'm okay.
It's okay.
- Oh, who is this girl?
There you go, girl.
Rip that pole.
(Laughing)
Oh, one foot, one foot-
- Fuck off, Weeks!
(Laughing)
(laughing)
- Woo!
I saw a smile!
- Stop it!
(Laughing)
- I won't say another word--
(screaming)
- No!
- Don't let go!
Weeks!
Weeks, help me!
(Laughing)
- No!
(Screaming)
(laughing)
- You're fuckin' dead!
(Laughing) You're fucking dead, you fuck!
Fuck you!
- See you this morning!
- Fuck you!
(Laughing) You're fucking dead!
(Pounding on door) - 7:30, Halsted.
(Chattering and laughter)
- You should get some hash browns before they're all gone.
(Tray crashing)
- Nice one, loser!
- Never realized how much I loved the hash browns.
- Jesus...
- Yeah.
Only it took him three days to rise from the dead.
- Good morning.
(Tray clattering)
- Okay, you died last night.
I saw you die.
- What was it like?
Do you... remember anything?
- I just remember right before, and then...
It's blank.
You know, I've thought about suicide before, but...
I mean, right in that moment, right before it happened,
I...
Can't believe how bad I wanted to live.
- We have to stop.
Right now.
- What?
- If today hadn't repeated--
- But it did repeat, and it looks like it's gonna keep on repeating.
- Yeah, w-we're tempting fate.
- We just gotta figure something out, okay?
We gotta get out of this somehow.
- You've got to be fucking kidding me.
This is a fucking gift.
We can do anything we want, anything.
It's your fuckin' loss.
- Don't you think it's kind of weird that all this stuff happens on the same day your dad dies?
- My dad used to force himself on me.
And a-at first, I-I didn't know what to do.
I mean, I...
I didn't even know what he was doing.
And as I got older,
I would fight back, but...
Never seemed to stop it.
So, I mean, I-I don't know what...
What, I'm supposed to give him some sort of peace of mind for that?
- Here we go.
No!
- No, no, no!
Don't!
Don't!
No!
- Fuck off!
- No!
- You don't want to do this!
- Who are you?
- You don't want to do this.
Look at me.
- Let go of me!
- You don't want to do this.
- Please let me go, please let me go.
(Sobbing):
Please...
- It's okay...
(sobbing):
Please let me go...
- The news said it was a man, but...
It was a girl.
Just a girl.
- I know, she's, like, the same age as me.
- Maybe that's what we're supposed to be doing.
You know, maybe we're supposed to be helping people.
- She's still going to be there again tomorrow.
- He grabbed me, and I tried, and I said stop, and he wouldn't, and I...
- Okay, we'll get you another jacket.
- Copy that.
We'll bring her in for an assessment.
Get all the necessary tests.
- What's going on?
- A girl got attacked.
(Sobbing)
- I need a description.
- I don't know what he looked like!
- Do you know who did this to you?
- Don't touch me!
- Can you give me a description?
- It was him.
- What?
- It was him!
- Hey, hey!
- Just let me go...
Don't touch me, okay?
- What the hell is the matter with you Kyle, huh?
- Kyle!
Stop!
Stop it!
- What the fuck?
- You raped her!
You fucking raped her!
- I don't know what you're fucking talking about!
- Don't fucking lie to me!
You raped a 15-year-old girl!
- Okay, first of all, she was 16, and I'm pretty sure that she was into it.
- You fucking raped her!
- Tomorrow, it'll be like it never happened, Kyle!
- It doesn't make it okay.
- So, what about holding up the liquor store, huh?
Is that okay?
What about kidnapping the dealer, sticking a gun in his face, making him eat cow shit?
You were this close to blowing his fucking brains out, Kyle!
Now you're on some fucking guilt trip, you're gonna tell me how I can act?
I don't know why this is happening, but since it is, I'm gonna take advantage of it, okay?
And you two better stay the fuck out of my way.
(Tires screeching)
- Why is this happening to us?
(Pounding on door) - 7:30, Halsted!
- Bob!
- What do you want, Halsted?
- It's Wednesday, right?
- Last time I checked, yeah.
(Chair leg clattering)
- Nice one, loser!
- I can't believe that Charlotte was hanging out with Tiko.
No, I...
I just never thought that she was-
- She was what?
Like you?
- I don't know.
(School bell ringing)
- Okay, so, I have a proposition for you.
- I don't think I want to hear this proposition.
- I stole them from my mom, and now you have to take them.
Come on, I went through so much trouble.
- How did you steal this?
- I took them from her purse like I take everything.
- Hey, Charlotte...
Hey, uh...
Look, do you want to, uh... just, um-
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Charlotte!
Hey...
Hi.
I'm Sonia.
Um...
Look, I know you think your brother's an asshole, and you're probably right, but...
It's just, if you would just let him talk to you for a minute, you would be doing me such a favour, okay?
Because I am so tired of hearing him bitch about how shitty he's been to you, and how you'll never forgive him...
Look, we're going to go get some Chinese food.
Why don't you guys come?
- Okay.
- Okay.
We can fit in the truck, right?
- Uh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Come in.
What colour?
- Blonde.
- You're gonna go blond e?
- Yeah.
- No...
Did not know.
I mean, I love the blond e, but your hair...
I mean, it goes so well with your eyes.
It's pretty.
- Yeah, well, we already bought the pack, and we're doing it this weekend, so...
- Should be fun.
(Door chimes jingling)
- Oh, ho, ho!
Well, well, well...
If this just isn't too cute for prime time.
You girls want to get more fucked up than you've ever been in your squeaky little lives?
- Put it away, Weeks.
- What, it's okay for you to smoke meth, but it's off limits for the rest of the family, is that it?
If it isn't the friendly neighborhood dick!
- Say that again, Weeks.
- How'd they ever let a gutless sack of shit like you become a cop anyways?
- Just keep talking.
Come on, Weeks, keep talking.
All right, you know what, that's not even remotely funny.
Look, you want to think very carefully about what you're doing right now.
- Oh, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
I'm all thunk out.
- Mike--
- Shut the fuck up, Kyle.
I'm gonna give you three seconds to get your ugly fat ass outta here.
One...
Hand away from the gun, Gerald.
Hand away from the gun.
There you go, there you go.
Two...
(door chimes jingling)
(gunfire)
(people screaming)
Fucking mess with me!
Yeah, no daddy coming for you!
Fuck off!
You don't know what you're missing.
- You guys okay?
Hey...
You okay?
Charlotte, you okay?
You all right?
You okay?
(People sobbing and whimpering in shock)
(pounding on door) - 7:30, Halsted!
- What are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
- Hey, everything that you're doing is gonna stay with you!
It's gonna stay with all of us!
- No, Kyle!
You do not want to do this, Kyle!
(Muffled shouting)
(garbled):
Kyle!
(Screaming in frustration)
- You have to do this.
- It's not gonna make any difference.
Nothing does.
- You have to try.
You know, it's amazing...
The things I could justify just to score, you know?
Like, I'll take this from my mom, she'll never know it was gone, or... steal my sister's ATM card... siphon off some cash here and there.
What's a kid need with all that money, right?
Then they...
They trashed my house 'cause of the money I owed.
And...
Beat the shit out of my little sister while I was five feet away... fucking blasted out of my mind.
- I couldn't let anyone touch me for the longest time.
- Come on, Mike...
You haven't had anything to eat or drink all day.
Me and Sonia are worried about you, man.
- Oh, you are, huh?
The two of you, the thoughtful couple.
How nice.
God, she finally got to you, huh?
Did she feed you the line...
What was it?
Uh... "I couldn't let anybody touch me for the longest time?"
It's right before she grabs your cock, right?
How was she for you?
You know, I wasn't all that impressed, myself.
The biggest challenge is to find a nice place to fuck around here.
Where'd you do it?
You didn't do it, did you?
What's the matter, buddy?
!
- Look!
Mike!
Just... stop, okay?
Stop.
Let's just forget about this, okay?
Let's just forget about all this shit...
And just try again.
Let's try to figure this out.
There's got to be some kind of deeper meaning... to this.
(Laughing)
- I...
I just took a piss in my pants.
There's got to be some deeper meaning in that, don't you think?
(Laughing)
See, look?
(Laughing)
I'll see you this morning!
- Are you tipsy yet?
- Maybe.
(Girls giggling)
Aren't you supposed to be locked up somewhere?
- Charlotte, I need to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Charlotte...
- Fuck off.
- I just thought if I could talk to her...
If I could explain...
Maybe there's just no point in me trying to explain the shit I did.
- Kyle, she'll come around.
- I don't know.
Are you, uh...
Are you okay about earlier?
- Yeah.
I'm very okay.
Doesn't a part of you wonder if maybe he's right?
I mean, if every good thing we do gets erased...
Every bad thing we do gets erased...
What does it really matter what we do?
- I guess...
I just need for it to matter.
(Pounding on door) - 7:30 Halsted!
(Tray clattering)
- Nice one, loser!
- Hey...
Bob, where's Mike?
- What?
- Sonia?
You know where they are?
I don't know, Halsted, having a smoke?
I don't know.
(Whimpering in fear)
- Drop the club.
Come on, Kyle, it's a fucking club.
Drop it.
You think you can decide how I spend my repeats?
It's only fair that I return the favour.
Take the knife.
(Crying)
The knife on the table, take it.
- What?
- Come on, Kyle.
Good.
Stand over there.
- Mike, what-
- Now...
Cut his throat.
(Whimpering and crying)
- Mike, please don't do this.
- Cut his throat, or I'll put a bullet in her leg.
I kid you not, Kyle.
I will put a hole in her leg the size of a fucking grapefruit.
(Gunshot) (screaming)
Do it, or I'll put a bullet in her head!
- You're fucked!
- That's right, get angry!
Get motherfucking feral!
Cut his fucking throat!
(Muffled crying)
(strangled choking)
Welcome to the club, Kyle.
- You're okay... (moaning in pain)
Come on, come on.
(Whimpering)
All right...
- We'll have fun...
- I'm okay.
Come on, what's wrong?
Come on...
- No, I'm okay.
I'm okay.
- Fuck!
- Get the fuck up!
Get up, you fucking piece of shit.
- I knew you had it in you.
I'm gonna give you three seconds to get lost.
- Fuck you.
(Gunshot, girl screaming)
(voice echoing):
See you this morning, Kyle.
(Pounding on door) - 7:30, Halsted!
(Panting in terror)
- Do you want me to come up?
- No.
I'm fine.
- You're gonna die tonight.
Don't ask me how I know, but it's true.
I've thought about what I wanted to say to you so many times.
I don't hate you anymore.
I don't, but I have to move on from this.
I have to, or else no thing's gonna change...
For any of us.
(Doorbell ringing)
- What do you want?
Are you in trouble?
- No, I...
They let us out for a few hours.
Can I-can I come in?
I really need to talk to Charlotte.
- I-I really don't think it's a good idea.
- Mom, I really need to talk to her.
- Are you clean?
- Yeah, Mom.
Please let me talk to her.
- Okay.
- Residents are reeling tonight over the death of two local police officers in what's shaping up to be a double homicide.
The suspect is described as a Caucasian male in his early 20s...
- Charlotte?
- What are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.
- Get the fuck out of my room.
- No.
Charlotte, no, I'm not going anywhere until you and I have talked, okay?
- We've got nothing to talk about.
Who's in the car?
One of your addict friends?
- Her name's Sonia.
Yeah, I met her in rehab.
I've been thinking a lot lately...
Just about...
About what I did to you and to Mom.
- I don't want to hear this, Kyle.
- And I can't let another day pass without telling you...
Without telling you how sorry I am.
- Fine.
Are we through now?
- Thing is,
Charlotte, I see you going down the same path that I did, and-
- You think I'm a fuck-up like you?
- No...
No, that's not what I meant.
- You don't have to watch over me.
- But I...
I do.
Charlotte...
Charlotte, I do, 'Cause that's what big brothers do for their little sisters.
And I know you probably don't care right now, but...
But from now on, I'm going to be there for you.
I'll be there for you when it counts, because...
I love you.
And...
And I'm gonna be your big brother.
(Pounding on door) - 7:30, Halsted!
- Sonia!
- Kyle?
- Drop it.
Drop it.
Good.
(Whimpering)
Now, I could tie you up all day, Kyle, let you wallow in your own piss, but that's not much fun.
So what we're gonna do is play a little game of hide-and-seek... with a twist.
If I find you...
I'm gonna spend the rest of the day hurting you.
(Crying)
(whispering):
You've got one minute.
One minute.
- You okay?
(Gun cocking)
- Other door.
One...
- Come on!
- ...two... three... four... five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten... (panting)
- Come on, come on...
- One minute!
(Engine revving)
- There!
There!
This way!
Yeah!
- Woo!
(Engine revving)
(panting)
- Come on.
Come on...
- Come on out, kiddies, I ain't got all day.
Come on out!
(Gunshot) (gunshot ricocheting)
- Come on.
Come on!
Come on...
Come on, come on... (gunshot) (glass shattering)
(screaming)
Go!
Come on!
Go!
- Are you guys having fun yet?
(Gun cocking) You know, the last rehab place I went to...
They had us act out horrible events from our past.
What do you say, Logan?
You could be nine years old again.
I could play daddy!
Or maybe Kyle could play daddy since he can't stop fucking you!
- What the fuck are you doing?
(Gunshot, man groaning)
- Go.
Go!
(Gunfire)
(screaming)
Go!
(Panting)
(forklift beeping)
- Hey...
Hey, kid!
(Gun cocking)
Hey, you all right?
(Gunshot, man groaning)
- It doesn't snow today.
What day is it?
I said, what day is it?
!
(Groaning)
(heavy breathing)
Oh, fuck...
- How are you doing?
- I'm fine.
I just got a tetanus shot and some stitches.
Where is he?
- No one's seen him.
- We need you to come with us.
(Siren wailing)
- Get your fucking head down on the floor!
If you two fucking move,
I will put a fucking bullet in your head, do you hear me?
I'll fucking kill you.
I will fucking kill you.
- Mom?
I'm sorry.
- Lieutenant, this is Kyle Halsted and Sonia Logan.
- So I understand you've been brought up to speed?
- Yeah.
- Most important thing is you keep him calm.
(Speed dial)
(telephone ringing)
- Gimme the phone, come on.
Hurry up!
Hello?
- I have your friend right here.
- Mike?
- Kyle.
- Mike, man, y-you didn't know.
You thought the day was gonna repeat again, right?
You thought you had a clean slate.
You didn't know.
- You think a jury's gonna fuckin' believe that?
(Charlotte sobbing)
- Mike...
We can fix this.
We got into this together, right?
So we can fix it together.
- You guys turned on me, man.
You should've let it go.
You should've let it run its course.
You should have had my back, Kyle!
Mike...
Please...
Don't do this, man.
Don't take it out on them.
Please, man, don't do this to Charlotte.
(Screaming and whimpering)
Mike?
Mike!
- Okay, we're going to have to go inside.
- No, no, let me try again, I can--
- Listen, this kid has killed two people already.
Come with me.
Hey, hey, hey!
- No, no, Kyle, don't!
- Stand down!
Everybody, stand down!
- Mike?
- Kyle, you die now, you die for keeps.
- Mike, I'm coming up, man.
(Hostages crying)
Mike, you gotta let 'em go.
(Crying)
- Nobody move.
Nobody fucking move!
Stay still and shut up!
- Mike!
That's my sister.
That's my baby sister and I'm not gonna let you hurt her, okay?
(Crying)
- I'm warning you, Kyle.
Stay where you are.
- Mike...
It's over.
- Stop.
- Just give me the gun.
- Stop.
(Gunshot, Kyle groaning)
(crying)
- I was never gonna make amends with my old man.
I never was, and I never will.
It doesn't matter how many days repeat!
- Give me the gun.
- That's the difference between you and me, right?
- Mike!
(Gunshot, girls screaming)
(sobbing)
Shh, shh...
It's okay, it's okay...
Shh, shh...
Shh...
Shh, it's okay.
- You okay?
- Yeah.

How is this even possible?
I mean... _it...
The stonn.
Last night, the powerwent out, right?
I was in the rec room and l-l touched the TV.
I got this shock.
That's the last thing I remember.
- Same thing happened with me with my light.
- Weeks?
- Who cares how it happened?
The real question is, what are we gonna do with it?
- What were you doing last night?
- Whatwere you doing?
- l was in the shower, okay?
I got shocked, too.
- Then what?
- l don't remember.
- Me neither.
- The same thing happened to all of us.
- Fuck, I'm gonna get that call again.
(door opening)
- Uh, Sonia, there's a call for you.
- Exactly the same.
- You all right?
- Shouldn't we be doing something?
We just lived through the same day mice.
Are we just gonna sit here and waste it?
- Last night, on the news...
There'_there's ajumper at the dam.
Let's go.
Let's do it.
- What about cu_ew?
- Fuck cu_ew.
- Shit, we gotta stop him.
- No, it's...
It's too late.
(Sonia sighs.)
(thunder rumbling)
- Couldn't sleep.
- Me neither.
At least you went to see him.
- l didn't.
- l thought you went to the hospital.
- l went to the hospital, but... I just couldn't go into his room.
- What do you think'd happen ifwe just...
Stayed in here all night?
- Trouble for sure.
- Then I'm not leaving.
(chuckling)
- Why do you think this is happening to us?
- Sory.
- No, it's...
It's okay.
- T:30, Halsted!
- Bob!
- What?
- What day is it?
Last time I checked, it was Wednesday.
- Look, we're gonna figure this out.
- We're not gonna figure out shit, okay?
We're gonna keep repeating the same day over and over again until we go completely out of our fucking minds.
- Okay, but, look, we each had the same shock of electricity or whatever, right?
So...
- So, what?
So maybe that's something that we do?
- Okay, you go and electrocute yourself then, sister, but I'm gonna enjoy it while I got it.
(quietly):
God, what is that girl's problem?
You know, ifyou think about it, it doesn't really matterwhat we do today.
Right?
I mean, I could take a piss in group.
As a matter of fact, I could just piss on Bob.
Tomorrow, it'd be like it never happened.
- Yeah. I don't know, man.
I... just feel like we shouldn't mess with it, you know?
- What do you think we should do with it?
- l don't know.
(laughing)
- Pull it out and put it back.
(laughing):
What?
- The bottle of gin.
I can see it in your pants.
Pull it out and put it back!

(tray clattering)

I saw you die.
- What was it like?
Do you... remember anything?
- l just remember right before, and then... lt's blank.
You know, I've thought about suicide before, but... I mean, right in that moment, right before it happened, I...
Can't believe how bad I wanted to live.
- We have to stop.
Right now.
- What?
- If today hadn't repeated--
- But it did repeat, and it looks like it's gonna keep on repeating.
- Yeah, w-we're tempting fate.
- Wejust gotta figure something out, okay?
We gotta get out of this somehow.
- You've got to be fucking kidding me.
This is a fucking gift.
We can do anything we want, anything.
It's your fuckin' loss.
- Don't you think it's kind ofweird that all this stum happens on the same day your dad dies?
- My dad used to force himself on me.
And a-at first, l-l didn't know what to do.
I mean, I... I didn't even know what he was doing.
And as I got older, I would fight back, but...
Never seemed to stop it.
So, I mean, l-l don't know what...
What, I'm supposed to give him some sort of peace of mind for that?
- Here we go.
No!

Don't!
Don't!

Just a girl.
- l know, she's, like, the same age as me.
- Maybe that's what we're supposed to be doing.
You know, maybe we're supposed to be helping people.
- She's still going to be there again tomorrow.
- He grabbed me, and I tried, and I said stop, and he wouldn't, and I...
- Okay, we'll get you anotherjacket.

We'll bring her in for an assessment.

- Okay, fint of all, she was 16, and I'm pretty sure that she was into it.
- You fucking raped her!
- Tomorrow, it'll be like it never happened, Kyle!
- It doesn't make it okay.
- So, what about holding up the liquor store, huh?
is that okay?
What about kidnapping the dealer, sticking a gun in his face, making him eat cow shit?
You were this close to blowing his fucking brains out, Kyle!
Now you're on some fucking guilt trip, you're gonna tell me how I can act?
I don't know why this is happening, but since it is, I'm gonna take advantage of it, okay?
And you two better stay the fuck out of my way.

Um...
Look, I know you think your brothers an asshole, and you're probably right, but... lt'sjust, ifyou would just let him talk to you for a minute, you would be doing me such a favour, okay?
Because I am so tired of hearing him bitch about how shitty he's been to you, and how you'll never forgive him...
Look, we're going to go get some Chinese food.

If it isn't the friendly neighbomood dick!
- Say that again, Weeks.
- How'd they ever let a gutless sack of shit like you become a cop anyways?
- Just keep talking.
Come on, Weeks, keep talking.
All right, you know what, that's not even remotely funny.
Look, you want to think vey carefully about what you're doing right now.
- Oh, I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
I'm all thunk out.

Like, I'll take this from my mom, she'll never know it was gone, or... steal my sistersATM card... siphon om some cash here and there.
What's a kid need with all that money, right?
Then they...
They trashed my house 'cause of the money I owed.
And...
Beat the shit out of my little sister while I was five feet away... fucking blasted out of my mind.

The mo ofyou, the thoughtful couple.
How nice.
God, she finally got to you, huh?
Did she feed you the line...
What was it?
Uh... "l couldn't let anybody touch me for the longest time?"
It's right before she grabs your cock, right?
How was she for you?
You know, I wasn't all that impressed, myself.
The biggest challenge is to find a nice place to fuck around here.
Where'd you do it?
You didn't do it, did you?
What's the matter, buddy?

Are you okay about earlier?
- Yeah.

(pounding on door)
- T:30, Halsted!
(panting in terror)
- Do you want me to come up?
- No.
I'm fine.
- You're gonna die tonight.
Don't ask me how I know, but it's true.
I've thought about what I wanted to say to you so many times.
I don't hate you anymore.
I don't, but I have to move on from this.
I have to, or else nothing's gonna change...
For any of us.
(doo_ell ringing)
- What do you want?
Are you in trouble?
- No, I...
They let us out for a few hours.
Can l-can I come in?
I really need to talk to Charlotte.
- l-l really don't think it's a good idea.
- Mom, I really need to talk to her.
- Are you clean?
- Yeah, Mom.
Please let me talk to her.
- Okay.
- Residents are reeling tonight over the death of_o local police omicers in what's shaping up to be a double homicide.
The suspect is described as a Caucasian male in his early 20s...
- charlotte?
- What are you doing here?
- l need to talk to you.
- Get the fuck out of my room.
- No.
Charlotte, no, I'm not going anywhere until you and I have talked, okay?
- We've got nothing to talk about.
Who's in the ca_
One ofyour addict friends?
- Her name's Sonia.
Yeah, I met her in rehab.
I've been thinking a lot lately...
Just about...
About what I did to you and to Mom.
- l don't want to hear this, Kyle.
- And I can't let another day pass without telling you...
VMthout telling you how sory i am.
- Fine.
Are we through now?
- Thing is,
Charlotte, I see you going down the same path that I did, and-
- You think I'm a fuck-up like you?
- No...
No, that's not what I meant.
- You don't have to watch over me.
- But I... I do.
Charlotte...
Charlotte, I do, 'Cause that's what big brothers do for their little sisters.
And I know you probably don't care right now, but...
But from now on, I'm going to be there foryou.
I'll be there foryou when it counts, because... I love you.
And...
And I'm gonna be your big brother.
(pounding on door)
- T:30, Halsted!
- Sonia!
- Kyle?
- Drop it.
Drop it.
Good.
(whimpering)
Now, I could tie you up all day, Kyle, let you wallow in your own piss, but that's not much fun.
So what we're gonna do is play a little game of hide-and-seek... with a mist.
If I find you... I'm gonna spend the rest of the day hurting you.
(cying)
(whispering):
You've got one minute.
One minute.
- You okay?
(gun cocking)
- Other door.
One...
- Come on!
- ...two... three... four... five... six... seven. ..
eight... nine... ten... (panting)
- Come on, come on...
- One minute!
(engine revving)
- There!
There!
This way!
Yeah!
- Woo!
(engine revving)
(panting)
- Come on.
Come on...
- Come on out, kiddies, I ain't got all day.
Come on out!
(gunshot) (gunshot ricocheting)
- Come on.
Come on!
Come on...
Come on, come on... (gunshot) (glass shattering)
(screaming)
Go!
Come on!
Go!
- Are you guys having fun yet?
(gun cocking) You know, the last rehab place I went to...
They had us act out homible events from our past.
What do you say, Logan?
You could be nine years old again.
I could play daddy!
Or maybe Kyle could play daddy since he can't stop fucking you!
- What the fuck are you doing?
(gunshot, man groaning)
- Go.
Go!
(gunfire)
(screaming)
Go!
(panting)
(forklift beeping)
- Hey...
Hey, kid!
(gun cocking)
Hey, you all right?
(gunshot, man groaning)
- It doesn't snow today.
What day is it?
I said, what day is it?
!
(groaning)
(heavy breathing)
Oh, fuck...
- How are you doing?
- l'm fine.
I just got a tetanus shot and some stitches.
Where is he?
- No one's seen him.
- We need you to come with us.
(siren wailing)
- Get your fucking head down on the floor!
Ifyou mo fucking move, I will put a fucking bullet in your head, do you hear me?
I'll fucking kill you.
I will fucking kill you.
- Mom?
I'm sory.
- Lieutenant, this is Kyle Halsted and Sonia Logan.
- So I understand you've been brought up to speed?
- Yeah.
- Most important thing is you keep him calm.
(speed dial)
(telephone ringing)
- Gimme the phone, come on.
Hury up!
Hello?
- l have your friend right here.
- Mike?
- Kyle.
- Mike, man, y-you didn't know.
You thought the day was gonna repeat again, right?
You thought you had a clean slate.
You didn't know.
- You think a juy's gonna fuckin' believe that?
(Charlotte sobbing)
- Mike...
We can fix this.
We got into this together, right?
So we can fix it together.
- You guys turned on me, man.
You should've let it go.
You should've let it run its course.
You should have had my back, Kyle!
Mike...
Please...
Don't do this, man.
Don't take it out on them.
Please, man, don't do this to Charlotte.
(screaming and whimpering)
Mike?
Mike!
- Okay, we're going to have to go inside.
- No, no, let me ty again, I can--
- Listen, this kid has killed two people already.
Come with me.
Hey, hey, hey!
- No, no, Kyle, don't!
- Stand down!
Eveybody, stand down!
- Mike?
- Kyle, you die now, you die for keeps.
- Mike, I'm coming up, man.
(hostages cying)
Mike, you gotta let 'em go.
(cying)
- Nobody move.
Nobody fucking move!
Stay still and shut up!
- Mike!
That's my sister.
That's my baby sister and I'm not gonna let you hurt her, okay?
(cying)
- l'm waming you, Kyle.
Stay where you are.
- Mike... lt's over.
- Stop.
- Just give me the gun.
- Stop.
(gunshot, Kyle groaning)
(cying)
- l was never gonna make amends with my old man.
I neverwas, and I neverwill.
It doesn't matter how many days repeat!
- Give me the gun.
- That's the dimerence between you and me, right?
- Mike!
(gunshot, girls screaming)
(sobbing)
Shh, shh... lt's okay, it's okay...
Shh, shh...
Shh...
Shh, it's okay.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Where the doors are moaning
All day long
Where the stairs are leaning
Dusk till dawn
Where the windows
Are breathing in the light
Where the rooms are
A collection of our lives
Where the doors
Are moaning all day long
Where the stairs are leaning
Dusk till dawn
Where the windows
Are breathing in the light
Where the rooms are
A collection of our lives
(siren wailing)
This is a place
Where I don'tfeel alone
This is a place
That I call my home...
(pounding on door)
- Get up, Weeks.
Another day in paradise.
Breakneck speed
Tying up your hands
'Cause you're landing back on yourfeet
You know what I mean
Vowel change
I remember when our voices used to sound the same
Now we just translate
'Cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
A_erwhat you did
Born on yourfeet running
Forest fires underneath your bed
But it's good to be back
Good to be back Good to be back
Spell it out
I always skip thewords
'Cause all the pictures are so bright and loud
Better omthan now
'Cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
A_erwhat you did
Born on yourfeet running
Forest fires underneath your bed
'Cause it's good to be back
Good to be back
Super fun
At the movies drunk and young
Double knots that came undone
But the big bad years are gone
Yeah the big bad years are done
And gone away
I remember when our voices used to sound the exact same
Now wejust translate
'Cause I'm still amazed you made it out alive
A_erwhat you did
Born on your feet running
Forest fires underneath your bed
But it's good to be back
Good to be back Good to be back
And you call it.
- Okay.
- All right.
[jazzy music, crowd cheering]
My wife made her pitch,
But I swung and gave it a ride!
It was off the wall,
And I knew it was gonna be close.
Slide!
Oh, you're out!
I lost.
But that's not important.
Because I learned in marriage everyone needs a ref.
I can do that.
Male announcer:
And tonight's panel
To help the marriage ref make his call--
Now, here's the marriage ref,
Tom papa!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Hooray!
Hi, and welcome to the marriage ref.
I'm tom papa, and tonight we're gonna watch real couples
In the middle of real-life arguments,
And we're gonna give them
The one thing they've always wanted--
A winner.
My marriage philosophy is simple.
I've been married for ten years.
I love my wife.
You know why?
We keep it simple.
Don't make it harder than it has to be.
I have single friends trying to get married.
They're already a mess.
"I...
I'm waiting for my soul mate.
I want my soul mate."
It doesn't exist.
Find someone you can tolerate.
How 'bout that?
Really.
Keep it simple.
Find someone you can sleep next to without throwing up,
And marry them.
All right, well, we've got a great show for you guys,
So let's get started and meet our panel of experts.
Now, in the opinion of our show,
If you are, been, just got, or are getting out of marriage,
We consider you an expert.
Our first guest is a movie star, tv star,
And our idea of a cool, sharp guy,
Alec baldwin!
[cheers and applause]
Our next guest you all know from live with regis and kelly.
You want eye candy that's also smart, funny, and talented?
You got it.
Kelly ripa!
[cheers and applause]
And finally,
He's tanned, he's rested, he's ready.
Jerry seinfeld.
[cheers and applause]
- Hi.
- Hi.
This is great.
Okay.
So the way this works
Is we watch each couple,
I discuss the issue with the panel,
They try and sway me in favor of the husband or the wife,
And then I make the call.
Is this a perfect system?
Not even close.
But at least the argument's over
And someone wins a prize.
Our first stop tonight--
Let's climb aboard the iconic long island railroad
And rumble out to the rustic hamlet
Of center moriches, new york to meet the rodolphes,
Whose pet is presenting somewhat of a stiff challenge
To their relationship.
[applause]
From day one, it was love at first sight,
As far as I could see, and I think she agrees.
[jazzy music]
* *
Every day's an adventure with kevin.
I think that that's what really attracts me to him.
I had him 14 years, this guy.
He was a great dog.
He was like my best friend.
The day that fonzie died
Was pretty much one of the best days of my life.
[laughter]
At fonzie's passing, I didn't cry at all
Because, uh...'cause I knew I was gonna do this.
[tense classical music]
* *
Audience:
Oh!
- [gasps] - take a look at him.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh...
My...
God.
Look at this guy.
Can I touch him?
Sure.
Go right ahead.
This is my guy, man.
I-I-I really-
- I really--
I really--I-I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
I cannot...
I cannot...
Cannot have this...
Would you relax?
I mean, calm down here.
In my house.
- Calm down.
- Oh, my god, I can't!
Oh, m--oh...
Just gonna make me happy to see him.
Next time you see him, you can take him with you.
He's gonna be ready to go home.
Yay.
Other people, they have animals for 14, 15 years,
The animal passes away, the animal gets buried.
Yeah, but he was a special dog.
Everybody thinks their dog is special.
- Yeah, but he's- - this dog is a special dog.
All right?
You should really respect my thoughts
A little bit, I think.
I will.
I will respect them.
You're gonna respect them,
But you're not going to change...
- I'll respect your thoughts.
- What you're doing.
This is my dream come true.
That's--that's maybe where the difference is, you know?
This is my dream, but it's your nightmare.
[laughter]
It's the opposite.
This is very important for me to have this guy stuffed.
I built a nice shrine for him, and I'll talk to him every day.
I want him to feel like...
Like it's a homecoming.
He doesn't have feelings.
His spirit.
His spirit and him will just connect right here.
It's gonna be good.
- But, babe...
- You know...
- He's not...
Going...
- It's all in connection.
Here.
You know, in two weeks' time,
You're just gonna- it's just gonna be like...
Still a dead dog.
[laughter] [cheers and applause]
So the issue here
Is should kevin be allowed to keep his dog around the house
Even though it's stuffed and dead?
Panel, what do you think?
In the words of danielle,
I would just like to say, I cannot...
I cannot...
I cannot...
I cannot...
Cannot...
Can't-annot fathom
Why that would make him feel better.
Right.
I think if you're gonna stuff your dog,
You should stuff it in either a useful or attractive position.
Like it's attacking.
Not in a lump.
Not in a dead position.
Not in like a lump where it's like a doorstop,
You know what I mean?
It was an unattractive stuffing of the dog, I thought.
Don't you?
An unattractive stuffing.
Yes.
Well, he's sleeping peacefully.
You know, people like to get into that middle realm.
Maybe he's not really dead, he's sleeping.
You know, it's a dead sleep.
He's okay.
He's okay.
I have to agree with alec, though.
I think they stuffed him the way he died.
I mean, it doesn't look like he died--
It wasn't like he died valiantly.
I think he cut corners.
He tried to save money on the stuffing, actually.
'cause this is more money.
If he'd gone for a big--
Well, look at the pedestal.
The pedestal is a little, uh, basic, isn't it?
It's like a hospital bed.
It's like a textbook with a paper over it.
Can I see her reaction when she first walks in there?
Yeah.
I-I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
I can't.
I cannot...
I cannot...
Cannot... [applause]
What I want to know is if this is something
That's done a lot.
Whenever I need facts,
I go to our very own just the facts ma'am,
From nbc news, the lovely natalie morales, everyone.
[cheers and applause]
Hi, natalie.
- Hello, tom.
Can you give me some idea
Of how many people are stuffing their pets?
Well, last year in the United States,
Roughly 1,000 people stuffed their pets.
You know, for kevin's sake,
I was hoping that number would be a little higher.
Anything that just a thousand people is doing,
That--that's crazy.
That's serial killer numbers.
Go ahead, alec.
Women come and go, but a stuffed dog is forever.
You know what I mean?
That may be where he's coming from.
It's kind of upsetting if he gets a new dog, too.
If he loves dogs so much, then a new dog walks in
And he's like, "oh, it's so good to be here--
Who the hell is that?"
Kelly:
You're right.
And when are you gonna do that to me?
By the time he's 65,
It's the madame tussauds of dogs in this house.
Come on, now.
And she's gotta be thinking,
"what will happen to me when I go?"
I mean, he obviously really deeply, deeply
Loves this dog.
I know, but...
You know.
[laughter]
There's a lot of dogs.
- I love my florist.
- Yeah.
All right.
No, no, I think something
May have slipped by you.
Can you bring up the attic, please?
I want you to take a look at this.
Obviously, he wanted to be a boxer.
- Yep.
- That didn't pan out.
Right?
He tried being in a band.
That didn't work.
He even got into painting.
Couldn't even find canvas to paint on.
That fails.
So here he is, sitting on the floor
Of his open-air attic of broken dreams.
But...
Through all of these disappointments,
Who stood by him?
Who was there the entire way?
Who was his rock?
Who is now as hard as a rock.
Yeah.
The fonz.
I'm curious why she...
She...
She could say that that's the best day of her life
That her husband's dog died.
That seems a little--
Because she killed that dog.
Do we have any more fun facts on them?
Do we have anything that tells us that?
The fonz, apparently, was a little bit of a menace.
He chewed holes in furniture, ruined eight couches,
Their water bed, and peed on friends.
[laughter]
Well, who doesn't pee on their friends?
I don't pee on my friends.
I don't do that.
[applause]
Okay, well, bottom line,
Who do you think I should go for?
Jerry?
Un, it's--it's gross, and he...
That top one there where you see the display--
That's the most disturbing.
Because you know there's gonna be a night
That he's gonna come home,
You know, maybe he's had a few
And...
You know...
- Things happen.
- And what?
He's gonna start talking to the dog.
She's gonna hear him talking to the dog
In the hallway or something.
She overhears him like, "come on, boy,
"one more time.
"come on!
Daddy's gonna help ya.
Oh, your tail came off."
So husband?
I'm sorry, husband?
No, no, the wife, the wife.
No dead dog.
- No dog.
Wife.
Kelly?
She happens to be completely sane and right in this,
And I'm gonna have to side with danielle 100%.
All right.
Okay.
Cool.
[applause] [long island accent] he loves his dawg.
Well, in the age of the internet,
He should be able to contact
One of these other thousand people
That stuff their dog,
And maybe they can form a little club and get a clubhouse
And keep the stuffed dogs in the clubhouse.
And not bring it home.
[applause]
So everyone's for the wife.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- I think it's unanimous.
- All right.
I think I'm ready to make my call.
[bell dings]
Let's go back to center moriches, new york,
And bring up the actual rodolphes
In their actual home.
How are you?
- Hi!
Kelly:
Um...
Is that a new...
- Ugh.
The dog is behind them.
Is that a new position?
Yeah, that's--that's him.
That's him.
- So wait, that's--
- Danielle...
- Ee...
We noticed in the taped piece
The dog looked like he was sleeping or still dead.
Now they've made him look more awake?
Yeah, he's- 'cause he was frozen.
- He was still frozen.
Shaddup!
He was frozen.
Quit talkin' over me.
He was still frozen, all right?
There was a little problem, little complication,
But, you know, he's here now,
And he's giving her the malocchio.
Which means the evil eye in italian.
All right, kevin, look,
I-I--really, I feel for you.
I know you love the dog.
I do.
But I gotta say, you have entered the horror movie zone.
You've crossed the line into wes cravenville.
Yeah.
You've scared danielle.
Frankly, y-you scared me a little.
And now you've scared a national television audience.
- I told you!
- I'm sorry...
But the dog is not going in that creepy grotto of grief.
So danielle, you win.
[cheers and applause]
Yeah, baby!
Yeah, yeah.
I knew it!
But kevin, listen,
I don't want you to get rid of the fonz, 'cause I like the fonz as well--I do.
- Thank you.
- But you've gotta keep him
In the open-air unfinished attic
Of broken dreams...
Where danielle can't see him.
I have an idea, kevin.
Maybe you could make him into a bobblehead
And put him in the back window of the car.
Hey, you know, that's a good idea.
I'll think about that.
I'll have to respect your opinion.
Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
We really love both of you guys.
- Aw!
Good luck to you.
Bye, guys.
All right, next up we'll see if there's any wiggle room
On this issue.
We will never...
Never-- with capital letters--
Have a stripper pole in this house.
[laughter] [cheers and applause]
Next, let's paraglide into the foothills
Of the beautiful blue ridge mountains
And gently touch down in gainesville, georgia
Where we check in with the hunters.
Greg has an idea,
But dianah just can't seem to wrap herself around it.
He's everything that I ever wanted.
I met dianah at a club
Dancing on top of the table.
He just came in with the ring one day
And threw it on the bed and say, "here."
That was his proposal.
- Who's my boo-boo?
- [giggles]
You can say what you want to say.
We won't get a stripper pole- - we gonna get one put in here.
- Let me tell you something.
- I'm gonna get one.
I'm-a keep it in the garage, hang it on the wall
Like it's a fishing pole.
If you and I was at this house right here by ourself
And it's Saturday night,
Put some rap music on,
You'd be twirling all around that pole.
We will never...
Never-- with capital letters--
Have a stripper pole in this house.
I think it would be interesting
To see my wife dancing on a pole for me.
Baby, you're sexy to me.
Let's have fun.
Look at it from my point of view.
Look at it from my point of view.
I can't see it from your point of view,
Because you're not the one that has to be on there.
I do.
And I'm your wife.
So you should respect me as your wife--
You should respect me as your husband.
You should respect me as your wife
And say, you know what, that's my wife's body.
If she don't wanna get that stripper pole--
- What did the preacher say?
- What?
I'm the man of the household!
Okay, why don't you get on there?
No.
No, a man don't get on no stripper pole.
All right, then.
Guess what.
This woman don't either.
You keep lookin' at it as a stripper pole,
Stripper pole.
- What is it?
- It's not a stripper pole.
- Yes, it is.
- It's a exercise pole.
[cheers and applause]
It's for both of our gratification.
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.
No, it's not.
What part don't you understand?
- Why you gettin' all mad?
- Because it's all about you.
It ain't all about me, baby.
It's about us.
- No.
No.
- We are one.
- I'm fine.
- When I said, "I do."
- Baby, I'm fine.
- We are one.
I'm fine.
Baby, this is something
That I've always wanted.
Guess what--people in hell want ice water,
But they don't get it.
So the issue here is should greg be allowed
To install a stripper pole in the bedroom?
[laughter]
Let's just begin by saying
That don't we all agree
That greg has made the greatest
Pro-stripper pole argument in male/female history?
Let's give him that.
I love her reaction when he went into his argument, though.
Can you show me that, please?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
I love her.
Jerry:
I love her too.
I love that lady.
I love this couple.
It's in the interest of romance, right?
- Yeah.
- So what's so wrong with it?
He led with "it's a stripper pole,
"I'll keep it in the garage.
People'll think it's a fishing pole."
And that, to me, doesn't say romance.
That, to me, doesn't say, "let's get it on."
That says, "let's go fishing.
" - right.
That's great, kelly.
Um...
I think we're wasting a lot of valuable network time.
I know how I'm voting.
Would you like to move to the vote?
Natalie, could this, in any remote way,
Be considered exercise?
Well, actually, pole dancing classes have become
Very popular as exercise.
And the information that I found
Says that pole dancing can burn up to 250 calories an hour.
It claims that it can increase flexibility,
Improves "body awareness" and strengthens muscles.
And what about for the woman?
Listen, I think she can get freaky deaky with him.
I think they would have fun and she might enjoy that pole.
I know, but let's--okay.
I think kelly just told us something about herself.
Freaky deaky.
I'm just imagining
That, okay, she goes along with it...
Yeah.
And they set up the music, the lights,
She gets an outfit, she gets a routine together.
- A routine.
- She's a director.
Yeah.
She does the routine.
It's still one guy in the dark clapping.
It's...
You know.
Then he'll start complaining after the-- like the third show.
"I thought you were gonna come up with something new."
Yeah.
Boo!
[laughter, applause]
Do you have any more fun facts about this?
You know, for his part,
Greg has given her about 50 thongs,
About $500 worth of lingerie.
So he's obviously trying to spice it up a little bit.
That's a lot.
He's making an effort.
Why would you go over 30 thongs?
Maybe this one, maybe this one, maybe this one,
Maybe this one, maybe this one, maybe this one.
All right, here we go.
Alec, husband or the wife?
I'm a sensitive man...
I'm a contemporary man.
I'm a man who understands the needs of women.
So I'm going to vote for the wife,
Because putting the pole in the room--
If she doesn't wanna do it- is ridiculous!
Ah!
Surprise, surprise.
- She doesn't wanna do it.
- Very good.
Booooooooop!
[laughter]
Kelly, what do you think?
I do think that she needs to hear what he's saying.
He wants more, maybe, affection.
He wants a show.
I'm having a very hard time with this.
I'm gonna-
- I'm gonna have to side
With the wife, although I do think
That they could have a good time on that pole.
[laughter]
All right, jerry?
I feel, in marriage,
Whatever maintains intimacy, excitement--
All right, so we'll dress it up with a giant rod and reel
In the garage.
Okay, we'll get some huge fish.
You know, "look at what we caught with this pole, honey."
- Okay.
- Right?
Husband?
I'm going with the husband.
Okay, now I'm ready to make the call.
[bell dings]
Let's go to gainesville, georgia
And bring up the actual hunters
In their real-life home.
[cheers and applause]
- How you doing?
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.
How are you?
- Hi.
How you doing?
Good.
How are you doing?
- We're good.
- Doing wonderful.
Did you get any exercise today?
[laughter]
You know what, I actually did,
But it definitely wasn't on a stripper pole.
[laughter]
Well, it's great to see you guys.
We thank you for coming on.
And I gotta say, I think, you know,
Just listening to jerry,
I believe this kinda stuff is all fine
Among consenting adults.
But in this case,
I think you need a little more than consent.
Because think about it,
Who wants to see a resentful, sulking pole dancer?
That's not good for anyone.
Just... [laughter]
[applause]
So I am sorry, greg,
No stripper pole in the bedroom.
Dianah, you win.
That's right, that's right.
I mean, here.
I mean, here.
Oh!
Oh!
[laughter and applause]
I mean, come on.
No!
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
It don't change the fact that we will not
Have a stripper pole up in here.
- No, you will not.
- It doesn't matter.
But you know what, on another show,
I may come back and tackle that thong issue.
All right, you bring it on then.
Congratulations, dianah.
[cheers and applause]
Thank you.
[applause]
Now comes the point in our show
Where we like to spotlight the line of the evening
That we thought had just that little bit
Of extra-zesty hot sauce on it.
Please welcome our announcer and legendary sportscaster,
Marv albert.
[cheers and applause]
Hey, it's time for the barbasol shot of the day,
Brought to you by barbasol.
Yeah, we still make it.
First up, this knee-buckling right cross
From dianah hunter.
And tonight's winner, danielle rodolphe
With this gleeful overhand haymaker
To the chin.
And he's down.
Get the stretcher.
This bout is over.
Tommy.
- Thanks, marv.
For being such great sports,
All our couples tonight will be swept away
On a romantic second honeymoon,
Furnished by royal caribbean international.
What?
[cheers and applause]
Oh.
Mwah.
That's awesome!
And now, here is a little sample
Of what we have coming up this season
On the marriage ref.
Starting this Thursday,
The marriage ref moves to its new home, 10:00, 9:00 central.
You ready to go?
* a love you want... *
Each week brings a new celebrity panel.
What?
With stars like...
It's a recipe for disaster.
And now your marriage is in their hands.
This is the dream team for therapy.
What if your husband said, "I like a bald woman"?
Bald where?
- Oh!
- Good night, everybody!
Pets have become the new mistress.
That cat is his mistress.
You insist on having a dead man's leg.
She's got her husband's old prosthetic leg!
This is the weirdest show I've ever been on.
If you just give them the schnookie,
They shut up and do what you want.
This is easily the most uncomfortable hour
I've ever spent in my life.
Why?
'cause you're sitting next to a woman
Who's standing up to you?

Where should we go?
Eh?
To where?
Of course we have to go somewhere that no one can recognize us.
The two of us?
You're not planning to join me...
Seems like you want to resign from being my secretary.
Ahjussi, please go to Ko Bang Dong.
What, why?
Nothing, you can go home first.
The photographers went to the cafe already.
I also contacted Dong Wook, he will come here shortly.
I don't think the problem was Writer Lee.
It should be because of the programme, so please don't worry.
Also, since he's with his secretary,
I'm sure, she would call if anything happens, so stop worrying.
Am I really that bad?
Eh?
Who do you think is more evil?
The way I treat Writer Lee, or the way Writer Lee treats me is more evil?
Oh Hyun Joo, say what you think.
Who is the evil one now?
Actually...
Am I supposed to work like this till I die?
It shouldn't be like this.
Get off.
Where are you going?
I said, get off the car.
When will you come back?
Get off the car.
I forgot about your family waiting for you at home.
I will let you know when I come back.
Be ready all the time.
Where exactly are you going?
Let's go.
Sir.
This is really...
Seung Yeon.
Hello.
Long time no see.
It has really been a long time.
So, you came back from Jeju island...
You wish to work closely with a writer, but he disappears and you have no idea where he is.
Ah, I really cannot imagine that.
I give up.
Actually, he has an older sister, but she lives in America.
They don't get to see each other much, once a year or so.
Seung Yeon.
Seung Yeon.
Yes?
Is something wrong?
Let's meet some other time, Manager.
Seung Yeon.
Seung Yeon, where are you going?
Why didn't she come in, where is she going?
Wait Sir.
What are you trying to do?
Let's go.
What is this?
I'm going with you.
Where are you going, get off.
I said, get off the car!
Why are you trying to get rid of your secretary?
I'm your secretary!
Since we started this together, we should also go together.
We decided to go together but you ask me to get off myself.
How do you expect me to report back to the president?
Do you want me to take the responsibility all by myself?
You really have no sense of responsibility.
Let's go ahjussi.
Are you crazy?
Who are you talking back to?
Ahjussi, let's go.
- Then I'm starting off now.
- Okay.
Stop.
Stop, stop.
What exactly are you doing?
Isn't this Dong Wook?
Are you alright?
Where are you going?
What?
Where are you going?
We are going for an investigation, what's the matter?
President told me, you both escaped.
She just asked me to search for both of you.
Where exactly are you going to?
Why didn't you go home.
We have something urgent.
Let's meet some other time.
Please move to the other seat.
What are you trying to do?
Ahjussi, let's go.
We are starting off for real this time.
Ah, this is really...
Another one again?
Dad?
Where are you going?
You just came back, where are you going again.
Mister, where are you going exactly?
No, this..
You just came back from Jeju island, where are you going this time.
This is really, I will tell you the details later.
Please move away now.
Manager, please get off.
What are you trying to do here, we are very busy.
No, you get off before we talk.
Mister, please you as well.
Didn't I say I will explain to you in the future?
Get out.
- This is really, Dad...
- Come out, come out, come out.
No, why are you like this?
Get out.
Sir, Sir.
Dad, no.
Noona, where are you going?
Why are they quarreling again?
Let me go.
Get off me.
Hello.
I'll explain later.
Okay,okay.
We are at Seoul.
It's for real.
I will go home soon, I said I will.
Yes, I can get off work.
I got it.
Do you want to drink coffee?
I have never experienced this kind of situation before in my whole life.
The superior that wants to disappear for a period of time, have to find a place convenient for his secretary considering her transportation.
Do you think this is acceptable?
You are right.
Didn't I tell you to get off the car that time?
How can I do that?
You call that betrayal.
We are partners.
What, partners?
Partners?
You said that we are partners?
Ah, well...
We are partners.
Do you know the meaning of being partners?
Partners are people with the same level of capabilities.
How can Kang Seung Yeon and I be partners?
How are we similar?
What can you do better than me?
You don't even have the strength.
Do you think you have?
I'm just saying it for fun.
Who told you we are partners.
I don't remember anyone who dare to say this before.
Or do you think we are, just by yourself?
Why keep doing this?
It is a very bad habit.
It is really good here.
This place is awesome right, Sir?
This is my first time in a president suite room in a high class hotel.
This place is really wonderful.
Sir.
How much does this kind of room cost?
Sir, you look like you are really rich.
Its just too cool.
Look at this red wine.
Sir, let's open one bottle later on.
Let's open the most expensive one.
When did you become so witty?
What about changing to another one?
There are also partners without similar level of capabilities as well.
Sir you're Don Quixote and I'm Sancho.
If not, what about Tom and Jerry?
Sir is Tom, while I'm Jerry.
You don't like it?
I find it rather good though.
You are starting to work now?
Don't come over unless I call for you.
I will call you over when I need you.
You are going to finish writing the draft here?
But I think it is best to give President a call.
She is very worried too.
I know there are a lot of staff there as well.
But I never agreed to all that.
She should take care of them.
Home delivery.
This is from the dry clean shop.
I'm here to inspect the gas.
Aigoo.
You even know how to change your identity.
I must inspect the gas by today.
Did this fellow escape because he knew I will come?
Didn't he come back from Jeju Island?
Welcome.
Hello.
Hello.
Today is a little empty.
Do you know where is Writer Lee?
Writer?
He escaped.
Escape?
He was suppose to film for a programme yesterday.
But he ran away.
Everything became a mess.
Is that it?
Does this fellow really think he is that great?
He didn't think what will happen to his friends at all.
That's why I say this kind of ungrateful fellow should not be nurtured.
I told her from the start not to care too much about Lee Jin Soo.
But she never listens to me.
Where is president Seo?
She is in her office.
Seo Eun Young must be really angry.
I shall ask her out for a drink.
What do have to ask her out for a drink?
Aren't you Han Ji Won?
Ah.
Y-y-yes.
Hello.
When did you come back from Busan?
Why did you come here for?
How can you come here?
Who is he?
He is President's grandfather, the founder of go Publishing Company.
Because my current company happens to be beside that block.
Because it's noon, so I came here to have a cup of coffee.
No, no, this is really a coincidence.
Why must you come to Eun Young's place to buy coffee?
You still dare to come?
Because this is the only coffee house nearby.
I'm very sorry.
But you haven't changed a bit;
you are stil as healthy as ever.
I shall take my leave first.
I heard you came back.
But you are still pestering Eun Young recently.
No, why would I?
Of course you can't, if you still have some conscience.
Yes, that's the case, but it's been a long time already.
I just want to reconcile with her.
How can you have so little conscience?
Conscience.
How many people have said that this is good?
About one out of ten people.
But the number is increasing.
Regular customers increased as well.
Is that so?
Grandpa.
Why didn't you tell me that you are coming over?
Why do I have to tell you when you are so busy already?
You've become prettier.
But why did Han Ji Won that fellow come here?
You know it too, his character.
That thick-skin fellow still dares to appear here.
He is doing whatever he wants when I'm not in Seoul.
How about staying here for the time being, Grandpa?
Then he won't dare to come here anymore.
Hello.
President, I'm Kang Seung Yeon.
Hello?
I'm Kang Seung Yeon.
Yes, speak up.
Grandpa, please wait a while.
For disappearing suddenly yesterday,
I'm afraid you will be worried.
Are you with Writer Lee now?
Yes.
Actually, he asked me not to contact you.
But, I wanted to call you because I'm afraid you would be worried.
He wants to finish the draft before going back.
He is writing it very seriously now, so you don't have to worry.
If anything happens, I will contact you again.
Hello?
President?
I got it, thanks for calling me.
It's nothing.
But, where are you now?
What?
I cannot tell you where I'm now.
But it's not too far away so you don't have to worry.
Is it President Seo?
Umm.
Hello.
President Seo Eun Young.
Yes, Writer Lee Jin Soo.
How are you?
Is everything settled?
It should be settled by now.
That is one of Seo Eun Young's skills.
Yes, it's my skill.
To clear up the mess Writer Lee leave behind.
You don't know how much rubbish there was this time.
If the next work will not sell good, I guess, I will really blow my top.
Yes, yes.
That is why I came here, it will of course be selling well.
Not only must you be serious, you have to do your best in writing as well.
This time it cannot be just best selling, Writer Lee.
You should know you are over the line already.
You better be mentally prepared.
How long more will it take, before it can satisfied your desire?
What?
You were not like this in the past, but now, you've become greedy.
How much more must you earn and become famous to be satisfied?
I may not be an easy Writer.
But, I'm not a machine either.
Even if I write many scripts non-stop, you never seem to be satisfied.
What can you do if you don't write scripts?
If you don't write, can you still survive?
You are only normal when you are writing books.
I let you write then what are you not satisfied about?
What can you do if you don't write books?
Are you going to be like the past?
Hiding somewhere taking drugs?
Then, if you find that very boring, would you give up on your life?
Who are you criticizing?
Saying I only care about money.
I would at least care about money.
What are you?
Playing childish games like this.
Playing good in front of others.
Only knowing how to joke around, and being insincere.
You say I changed.
I changed because I'm a human, you rubbish.
I thought if you became famous, you would change and have a sense of responsibility.
But, how come you never change even a tiny bit?
You want to train your secretary to be a pro.
I can see she is even more professional than you.
Whatever the superior wants, she does it.
She will worry for people around her.
Who is a professional?
Humans need to have a true heart.
She is much better than you, who exactly is teaching who?
Finish the first draft this month.
I will not forgive you if you delay it any further.
I never told her where we are.
I only told her we are doing well.
Grandpa.
Sorry, it took so long.
Writer Lee is that Lee Jin Soo?
Yes.
Where is he writing his books?
Not in the work studio?
What happened?
He ran away, to avoid me.
Why does he has to avoid you?
Because he hates me.
He say, I'm a boss who only cares about money.
He earns money too when you earn money, why is he hating you?
Writer and publisher rely on each other for survival right?
That's right.
He is very foolish from the start.
Eun Young.
I'm sorry.
Just a moment.
You are crazy Seo Eun Young.
You are not youngster anymore, what are you doing.
Manager.
Yes, I have a favor to ask from you.
Writer Lee only drink coffee from the coffee house rost.
Zamirica blue mountain.
Can you drop a pack to my house, so I can take it from there.
Of course I can, how hard can that be?
Thank you, I will treat you next time.
How about a movie?
Excuse me?
A movie.
Treat you to a movie, of course.
- Let's do it.
- When?
Excuse me?
When are you treating me to a movie?
When am I treating you to a movie?
- I have to receive the coffee first.
- Let's make it today.
What?
Because I can bring the coffee over today.
You want to watch it today?
But I don't know Writer Lee's schedule for today.
I'm not sure when I will get off from work too.
Midnight.
What?
You want to watch at the midnight time?
It's fine, I have no objections.
Then later.
Okay.
What should we watch?
Okay, okay.
But...
You must never tell President that we are in Seoul now.
Otherwise, I will get a scolding.
What?
President?
I heard that President cried.
Manager said so.
It seems to be after the phone call with you.
What to do?
She seems to be really hurt by us running away this time.
Will she be in trouble as well?
This is really...
I should not have listen to you.
It always turns out like this.
All because of your own convenience, everyone become troubled.
But, you can act like nothing has happened and continue writing.
Participating in such a programme would not hurt you.
It's not like you were filming for a commercial.
It was a good opportunity.
Why are you being so hard?
You are speaking without thinking too much.
I praised you once and there you are going overboard.
It would be great if you can have a dinner with me?
How can I, when they are already waiting for me?
Then, I shall go to see you tomorrow.
But you...
Yes?
You don't have any special relationship with Lee Jin Soo, do you?
Excuse me?
You not accepting others, is it because of him?
No.
Didn't you just hear us quarrel over the phone?
Why are you suspecting?
No matter what you add to a good cup of coffee, its unique fragrance will always remain unchanged.
I understand.
I heard you were getting along very well with his late wife.
That fragrance will not disappear along with time.
If this continues, the problem is going to be more serious.
I got it, it is not like that.
Then why don't you want to date?
Why would I be afraid?
I don't want to.
Why don't you feel like it?
All of them cannot meet my expectation.
I thought I will have chance if I meet more of them.
But I never thought after I met one, it happens to be the worst, Han Ji Won.
Okay, I understand that.
Please be careful.
You go back too.
What is this?
The graduation photos.
I thought, I threw them away.
But, it turns out to be here.
Why are there so many left?
Why did I take so many pictures with him?
What are you looking at?
What did you just threw away?
Why did you appear here suddenly?
It seems to be photos.
Who's photo is that?
What are you trying to do?
This is making me very curious.
I thought you went out of town to work.
Were you always in Seoul?
What are you doing?
Is it photos to be burned?
Is it some kind of nude pictures or what?
I looked at it before anyway.
Just like our relationship.
Say it again.
I ran away because you were like this.
But because of my secretary, I couldn't.
Do you think making silly faces in front of me, will solve the problem?
Why did you come back for?
Didn't I ask you to come back after finishing your draft?
How much loss have you suffered?
Why did you cried in front of your staff?
I heard that Seo Eun Young cried, so I was afraid the company will go bankrupt.
Who do you think I am?
How can my company collapse because of one Lee Jin Soo?
Of course it won't.
You are Seo Eun Young.
Didn't I tell you before how formidable I am?
You don't have that much impact on me.
- Is that so?
- Of course it is.
- Who do you think you are?
- That's my phrase.
What are you?
So, let's just forget about it.
I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
A hotel in Seoul?
Relax, I'm still writing the book, nothing will happen to me.
Don't worry.
When did I worry about you before?
So, since you have never worried about me before, I shouldn't worry for Seo Eun Young as well.
It is all because my secretary exaggerated too much.
I shall take my leave.
What should I do about you?
When you always brush off everything with your jokes.
Nothing you said is sincere.
Then why did you come back for?
- Hello.
- Seo Eun Young
I can see you are drinking wine now.
I'm thinking of you while drinking now.
What about you?
Are you thinking of me too?
- I will come over now.
- Stop it already.
We are not like 2 person forbidden to drink together...
This person is really irritating!
Kang Seung Yeon, it's me.
Which hotel are you at?
How do you know it's a hotel?
What?
But, if Writer Lee learns about it...
No, I cannot tell you.
Writer Lee went over already?
I came to see my lovely lady...
One minute ago she was here.
Did she go to the bathroom?
It must be it.
Shall open the drink first?
Seo Eun Yeong, because of you, I'm going to open this bottle of liquor.
Why is the door open?
What are you doing?
Jin Soo
This is not your office, why are you hugging someone's waste bin for?
where is Seo Eun Young?
Women's heart are the most vicious ones but she cannot do this to me as well.
Our relationship is not the normal relationship.
Take a look at this!
She tore all my face into pieces.
No matter how much she hates me, she should not do this to our memories.
I treasure our photos like gold.
I thought what can it be.
We are not of a normal relationship.
You know it, don't you?
Eun Young and I have always been very blissful.
You must remember, what others call us.
You still remember, right?
What they call us.
Han Ji Won and Seo Eun Young.
The perfect match...we are a perfect match.
Where did Seo Eun Young go?
Jin Soo, Jin Soo...
Does Eun Young really not love me anymore?
I thought we would be together.
That is why I told you from the start the way you think is too absurd.
Where exactly did Seo Eun Young go?
Hello.
This place is so near to the company.
Why did he choose Seoul?
I thought it will be on top of a mountain or cliff
It turned out this way.
Kang Seung Yeon you give me a totally new perspective
- What?
- He is not back yet?
We separated for quite a long time already.
- He is not back yet.
- Then, let's wait for him.
- Let's have a drink together.
- What?
No, thanks.
Then, I shall drink it myself.
I'm feeling really moody recently because of that person.
Working with Lee Jin Soo must be very tiring.
- What?
- I feel tired as well.
Really very tired.
It is a little hard to cope at first, but it is much better now.
- Is it?
- yes
We have a better understanding on each other now.
Sometimes, I can even guess what his next line will be.
That is very promising.
But, why do I feel more and more tired?
Why am I getting more tired?
I guess it's my own problem.
You seem to be a little drunk.
Why are you treating me like this, why?
Who am I?
I'm Han Ji Won.
Why must you tear my face into pieces?
Why must I be treated like this?
I got it, I got it.
Get on the car as well, I will give you a ride too.
It's fine, just go!
Jin Soo, Lee Jin Soo!
She said the love turns bad.
How can love can turn bad?
How is that called love?
- Only sushi will turn bad.
- What does this to do with sushi?
Okay, sorry for the trouble.
Hey fellow, explain it to me.
Writer should be able to understand.
Jin Soo, can love turn bad?
Can it?
Why are you so late?
I went to settle something.
You actually drank wine during working hours.
I did not drink it.
Who came?
President came.
Didn't you meet each other already?
She already knows which hotel we are in so I cannot refrain from telling her.
- Where is she?
- She is in the bedroom.
She drank too much wine.
So I told her to lie inside.
She seems to be in a very bad mood.
It seems like she has been very tired, what should we do?
You can leave.
- What?
- Get off from work.
Seo Eun Young
Are you alright?
You have not leave yet?
I'm about to leave now.
Did you get scald?
I will ask them to bring the medication over.
It's okay.
You should have let me do it.
- Its fine, you don't have to do it.
- but...
I ask you not to touch it.
Why are you not getting off work yet?
What about President?
She probably won't wake up till morning.
Then, I shall see you tomorrow.
Are you going home?
No.
You have something planned?
Not really, but I'm going to catch a movie today.
- At this hour?
- I want to relax a bit.
I see this is a planned schedule.
Go now!
But I can cancel it.
It is not urgent, so I can cancel it.
I can tell him now that.
I'm not going anymore.
Who are you going with?
Friends?
It's manager.
Dong Wook?
He helped delivering your coffee grind so I treated him to a movie.
It is not very important so we can go some other day.
Don't cancel it.
Let's go together.
I know Dong Wook anyway.
Is that okay with you?
It would be better if more people come along.
That is great, let's go together.
Why don't we take taxi?
Wouldn't you take bus if I did not come along with you?
You want to take taxi?
No, bus can be fast as well, but I thought you don't take bus?
Since I'm tagging along, you don't have to care about me.
I shall listen to you since it's not work time now.
What is the matter?
No, I feel a little embarrassed when you treat me like this.
I separate work from my life clearly.
Why would I have the authority now, when I'm not paying you for your work hours.
Can you lend me one bus card?
I don't have one.
I can treat you to just one trip.
There is one more passenger.
How many stops are there?
7 stops.
It suddenly feels like the first time we met.
When you first came to the our cafe, you were like a gentleman.
My first impression of you was really good.
I'm that type, who can only rely on first impressions.
That is true.
I can only understand you to a certain extend, the least I know, the better.
You don't have feelings for me anymore now right?
That is not the case.
I really don't mean that, I only mean you are different from my first impression of you.
What are you doing?
What?
You're still torturing me a moment ago...
But it's not working hours now.
I said before I won't torture people when I don't pay them.
Just enjoy the lady treatment I'm giving you now.
What time is it now?
What, what do you want?
I asked what time is it now.
12.30 am
Are we late?
We are reaching soon.
My god, I'm actually going to a movie with Dong Wook at this hour of the day.
At first, I wanted to watch the movie with manager, but Writer Lee wanted to join too.
Meeting you so awkwardly in the middle of the night feels good.
Yes.
Thank you, this is what Writer Lee prefers.
- Thank you very much.
- Yes.
I will go exchange for 3 tickets.
It's been a long time since I came to a cinema, it feels a little awkward.
Should we buy something to eat?
Do you want popcorn?
As for the drinks...
What is this?
Please be careful!
It's too dark in here.
Be careful, it's too dark here.
Sir, it's here!
Come on take this seat, I prefer siting along the aisle.
This is my seat.
What?
We are number 7, 8, 9.
But this seat is number 6.
So, it's arranged like this.
Sir, come over here to sit.
Have some popcorn!
I'm feeling terrible after sitting here.
- What?
- Nothing.
If you have anything you want to say then say it in that direction.
What?
I never expect much from the movie, but it turns out to be rather good, right?
It's fine as long as you find it interesting.
Sir, let's go have some ice cream!
I'm feeling a little tired now.
Both of you can go, I will treat you next time.
Dong Wook, is that fine with you?
It's okay even if you don't treat.
I will take a stroll, both of you can have fun.
Sir, Sir!
You said you want to eat ice cream right?
What?
I feel like eating it suddenly.
Since you treat me to the movie, I shall treat you to the ice cream.
that...
I said I'm treating you.
No, it should be in that direction.
The shops there should have been closed by now.
Seo Eun Young, sleep properly.
Who is this?
This is Jin soo's voice.
Have you come?
Yes, it's me!
You rascal, if you continue being like this, after letting me go, you will surely regret for life.
That person cannot do without me, yet he is putting on a strong front in front of me.
You, really not sincere at all.
Because you are not sincere, so no one will treat you sincerely.
I didn't care about money at all... but you turned me into this... do you know...
I really cannot take it any more.
Take care of me.
If you don't... then who will?
I have had enough, everything has ended.
It will be like this for the rest of you life.
The person who makes me dream
I want to give all of my love.
I love you.
Please love me.
I can't be without you even for a day.
I may not be your first love
I'm very happy nonetheless.
Can you see my love?
Can you hear my heart beat?
It could be that I loved you even before.
I don't know why, you're on more on my mind
My heart is asking for only one person.
I don't know why, love scares me.
What shall I do when you look at me like that?
The person who excites me
I think my heart has been found out.
I love you.
Please love me.
I can't be without you even for a day.

He is treating Kang Seung Yeon rather well.
Where do you want to carry on to?
Did I dream yesterday?
Previously on "The Event"...
Protecting the country involves the keeping of secrets, Mr. President.
The president uncovered a conspiracy that spans a century.
- How many prisoners?
- 97.
- Why are we holding them?
- They have a hidden agenda.
- The man at the center of it...
- Sean Walker.
Is on a search for his fiancee.
I think they're gonna kill her.
Sean, please come and get me.
Sophia, the leader of a mysterious group of prisoners remains silent.
I'm offering a deal.
I can't defend this, but I won't betray my people.
And after plane meant to kill the president...
Jumped from Miami to Arizona in an instant...
They're dead, sir.
Every last one of them.
Could their deaths have been the result of whatever transported the plane here?
The over 200 dead passengers took a strange turn.
- I-I need some people down here now!
The event begins now.
All right.
Down!
I don't see anyone anymore.
But that doesn't mean anything.
Just drive.
Where?
Just anywhere away from here.
The boyfriend got away.
I spent time with Walker.
He shouldn't have been a problem for you and Smith.
Yeah, well, he was.
But based on what we think he's told the FBI, it's clear he's starting to put all this together.
You better move the girl.
- What are you doing?
- This is their car.
The shooters'.
Maybe there's something that'll tell us who they are.
Damn it.
Nothing.
Well, at least now you believe me.
I haven't gotten that far.
- What's this guy doing?
- What?
See this guy?
See how fast he's going?
Yeah, yeah, I see him.
- It's him.
Go.
Go faster.
- What?
Just go faster.
Okay, he's gaining.
- Just... just floor it.
- I am.
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him!
I can't.
I can't.
Not at this distance.
Well, so what do we do?
Ah!
Okay, okay, just hit the brake hard.
- Did you say brake?
- Yes.
Then cut the wheel to the right.
Just trust me.
- Okay.
- Now!
- I got him.
Go.
- Are you sure?
Go!
Got it.
All right, I disconnected the car's GPS so they can't track us.
Well, not using that anyway.
I worked with those men for four years.
Day and night.
I want the people who did this.
I want them to pay.
You're going to tell me everything you know.
You understand?
That's what I've been trying to do.
So tell me, how do I find these bastards?
Well...
Yeah.
Through her.
The woman who's holding leila.
Vicky Roberts.
Or whatever her real name is.
These are the aliases that I pulled up.
We just have to hope that she's still using at least one of them.
All right.
All right.
I'll make some phone calls and... no, you can't.
You can't.
You saw what happened when you called someone about me.
No, there's people I can trust.
My ex-husband works at justice.
You know his social and date of birth?
Yeah.
Then I can get you into that database.
Look, you've been lucky, okay?
But you have...
you have no training.
You're just...
you're not capable.
I was capable enough to save your life.

Season 1, Episode 4:
A Matter of Life and Death
I noticed something wasn't right.
The seatbelt light was on, but a passenger got up anyway.
Where am I?
I'm hungry.
I haven't had anything to eat.
I was going to Brazil and the last thing I remember is taking off from Miami international.
- I-I-I don't know what happened.
I've been trying to figure out what happened.
Why... why don't you tell me what happened?
I remember shutting my eyes, willing myself to get there.
And then I opened them and I'm here.
I want my mommy.
I work for the damn government.
I expect you to tell me what the hell's going on in here!
Nobody will even tell me where I am.
Okay?
Does... does that seem normal to you?
Nothing has been made clear.
Why can't I remember anything about it?
I don't understand this.
I saw these people and they were dead.
We ran high frequency pet scans on the passengers for the autopsies.
And now having gotten the results, we can see there's some evidence of mitochondrial activity.
Are you saying they were still alive and you didn't know it?
- I'm saying their vital signs were sub-viable.
There was no heartbeat, no pulse, no brain activity, but something... some process was still going on in their bodies.
Meaning?
At this point, sir, I would just be guessing.
We simply don't know what was done to them and they can't tell us.
All the passengers remember is their take-off from Miami.
- Okay.
Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you, doctor.
Why?
Why do this?
Seemingly kill these people only to bring them back to us?
Maybe it's a display of power.
Them showing us what they can do.
To what end?
'Scuse me a moment.
What is it?
Mr. Vice president, the pilot, Michael Buchanan, he's awake.
Good.
I want to talk to him.
There's a problem.
Director sterling is already in with him.
Buchanan may hold the key to who was behind the plot to kill the president.
Sterling's the last person we want him talking to about it.
Mr. Buchanan, we already know you got on that plane intending to kill the president.
They, uh, they killed my wife.
They took my daughters.
They were going to murder Leila in front of me.
You do whatever you want to me.
But, please, just tell me my daughters are okay.
Your daughters haven't been located yet, Mr. Buchanan, uh...
But I'll see what I can do to help.
In return,
I need you to tell me about the people behind this.
Who was forcing you to fly that plane into the presidental compound?
I don't know who they are.
I don't even know what happened.
Focus on the people who did this.
On what you know about them.
A name.
A conversation you overheard.
Please, Mr. Buchanan.
We need to find them.
Leila knew the girl who was going to kill her.
Her name was Vicky.
That's all I know.
We'll talk again, Mr. Buchanan.
How long have you been standing there?
Long enough to know you've been keeping information from me.
Why wasn't I told you were interviewing the pilot?
As we've discussed, you're not running the investigation into the assassination attempt...
I am.
And you know how I feel about that.
Oh, yes, I remember your insinuation quite clearly.
And I chose not to be offended by it.
That's all you have to say?
The president and I have our differences.
But the idea of me having anything to do with trying to kill him...
Is absurd.
If only because that would put you in charge.
There was this little girl.
She couldn't have been much older than David.
I saw her at the crash site lying there, her skin gray.
She was dead.
And then today, there she was.
She was standing there right in front of me.
- Hmm.
It's like a miracle.
- It's not a miracle.
It's not a miracle.
It's something else that Sophia's people can do that we just don't understand.
Elias, it's natural for you to question this.
You feel betrayed.
But as scary as the past few days have been, everyone has come out of it alive.
Things could be a lot worse.
- Yours?
- No, I don't think so.
- Hello?
- David.
- David.
- David.
Dad, it's for you.
Who is this?
I'm the man who pulled the plane out of the sky to save your life.
Secret service.
I guess I should...
I should thank you.
But you know, you caused quite a scare with what you did to those passengers.
Hmm.
That was by design.
I see.
Well, maybe you and I should sit down and talk.
Face-to-face just you and me.
No.
There's been enough talk.
What do you want?
Release Sophia and the rest of the detainees like you promised to.
That promise was based on the premise that we were both being honest with each other.
Mr. President, I don't need to hear your excuses.
Release Sophia and the detainees or this time people will die.
Oh, hold on.
Hold on.
Wi-fi.
Pull over.
Pull over.
Found an unsecured node.
It's amazing how many people still don't password-protect their wi-fi.
Clearly, they have no idea what lurks out there.
Okay.
We're in.
I used your ex's info to backdoor the password recovery system.
So what now?
Okay, look for bank accounts or credit cards for any of the identities she's been using.
Then see if there's been any recent activity.
- Search protocol is pretty self-explanatory.
So this is how you make a living?
Well, I freelance writing code and making video games.
- Mm.
- Oh, here we go.
One of Vicky's aliases, a Laura roderick, just paid rent on a house last week in Lubbock, Texas.
And she used a credit card in that name to buy groceries in the same area.
So she's there now.
But do you think Leila could be there?
Last time anyone saw her, she was in Miami.
There's someone out there that you're making very nervous, so it makes sense that maybe they would've, you know, moved her.
Either way, it's... it's a lead.

Well, Michael flew international forever till Leila was, like, ten.
And then finally, he made the switch and flew domestic.
And that's when he took the job at Avias.
- Ooh, should I check on Sam?
- No, no, no.

Well, Sean, it must be hard on your folks not having you around for the holiday.
Uh, it is.

Uh, here and there, you know.
They, um, they move around a lot.
For work or they just like to travel?
They just...
Move around a lot.
Where are they spending Thanksgiving?
Uh, you know, um...
To tell the truth, I
- I...
Haven't really spoken to them in... in a while.
My... my parents split when I was a kid.
And my mom, she...
she wasn't, uh, well.
So, uh, my dad got full custody.
But then after the separation, he just kind of fell apart.
Started, uh, drinking and...
Anyway, I just was glad to be out of there after high school.
I haven't really, um, spoken to them since.
And, yeah.
And I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to lie earlier.
I just felt weird, uh, telling you guys that stuff.
That's my story in a nutshell.
Room service.
Get the okay on the girl yet?
Any minute.
Just talked to Lonner.
Apparently Walker disabled the GPS on the car.
And he figured out a way to jam his cell phone so we won't be able to track him with that either.
Told you Walker wouldn't make it easy to find him.
He's smart.
There. 255.
Yellow house.
Okay, drive past it and pull over here.
Curtains were closed.
I can't see what's going on inside.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
Hello.
Got it.
Understood.
Good to go on the girl.
- Finally.
- No, no, no.
I'll do it.
Oh.
That's what I figured.
Meaning?
Meaning you got something personal with her, don't you?
No.
It's never personal.
I just like to finish what I start.
What?
This is against everything I've been taught.
Going in alone.
Well, we have no choice.
We know that they're monitoring the FBI and probably the local police.
Okay, you understand that we don't know how many people might be in there, right?
I know.
Which is why I think you should give me a gun.
Without training, you're more dangerous with a gun than not.
So just stay behind me and keep those eyes open, all right?
We're gonna need another car.
See what you can dig up.
FBI.
Are you alone in the house?
We have a $67 billion intelligence budget and we still can't trace a damn phone call?
These people got close enough to my son to put a phone in his bag!
We're looking into the possibility it was done while David was in school when the bag may have been left unattended.
Which it shouldn't have been.
I want everyone on my son's secret service detail replaced.
I want security around him and Christina increased immediately, understood?
I don't care how you do it, but you're gonna find the man who made that call.
Yes, sir.
I want you to know every single agency under my purview is doing everything it can to protect your family.
All right.
We need to focus on the larger threat.
He said "people will die. "
Well, we've upped the threat level to orange, doubled air surveillance and security at international checkpoints.
We are as ready for his next move as possible.
They can transport an airliner 2,000 miles in the blink of an eye.
We have no idea what else they can do.
But we know they have some limits.
For instance, they can't transport Sophia and the detainees out of our custody or they would have done so by now.
Any idea as to why they can't?
Until we get real intelligence, it's all just guesswork.
Unless we get Sophia to talk.
I don't know what to talk about with this...
Person.
Is that what we call her?
A person?
- You're nervous.
- I know.
Why?
- I love it.
- I mean, I'm good at this.
Right?
I can talk to anyone.
Babe, it's a meet and greet.
Bread and wine and some kind of tofu thing.
It'll be over before we know it.
Oh, no.
She's a vegetarian?
- Vegan, apparently.
- Oh, forget it.
We have absolutely nothing in common.
Come here.
Where are you going?
This way.
Come on.
Oh, thank you.
It's all so delicious.
That's because I had nothing to do with it.
Ha.
I managed to marry a Cuban girl who doesn't cook.
So how did you two meet?
- Ah.
- Our mothers set us up.
Ah.
They came over together from Cuba as teenagers on the same fishing boat.
Yes.
My mom was pregnant and very alone.
And Christina's mom took care of her during the trip.
Then they lost touch when they got to Miami.
But then 30 years later, they're standing in line for bocaditos at La Rosa bakery and, uh...
And here we are.
Amazing.
A refugee comes to this country pregnant, poor, alone, and a generation later, her son is the president.
This is why your country is truly great.
- I couldn't agree more.
- Mm-hmm.
So you understand why I'm hopeful that you will welcome my people the way that this country welcomed yours.
My dream is that one day my people will sit around a table like this and tell their immigration stories and it will seem no more strange than a tale of a fishing boat from Cuba.
- I-I am sorry...
I'm sorry that it's come to this.
If you were so sorry, you would start talking.
Who made that call, Sophia, and how do I stop them?
- You know that I can't...
- No, no, no.
It's not that you can't.
You won't.
You do exactly what you want, no matter the consequences.
Isn't that right?
- You...
- Isn't that right?
The plane.
The passengers.
It's all you.
You're pulling the strings.
You're wrong.
I didn't condone any of this.
You had one of your own killed because he was going to talk.
What?
Did you think I'd never figure that out?
Sophia...
You call yourself my friend.
If there's anything true to that, if there's anything that's real that's left, please...
Tell me what you know.
His name is Thomas.
He is intelligent, charismatic.
A natural leader.
But we've always had different ideas about how to adapt to our presence here.
He is less patient.
Impulsive.
Where is he now?
I don't know.
But whatever he's asking you for, give it to him.
Well, what he wants...
Is you and the detainees.
That's not going to happen.
Listen to me, Elias,
I know him better than anyone.
You need to give him what he wants.
- Or what?
- I don't know.
But please, for the safety of your people, do what he says.
Suki, I want you to go to ward one.
Jake, go to ward three, please.
I'm positive.
I've never seen her before in my life.
Then why is she, uh, paying for you to live here?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well... now, I have seen your credentials, agent Collier.
But I don't believe I've ever seen yours.
Who are you?
Agent Walker.
Agent Walker must've left his badge in the car again.
Can we talk for a sec?
What are you doing?
Lower the hammer on her.
She's obviously lying.
And so are we.
If she figures out we're not here on official FBI business, she's gonna stop talking.
So what do we do?
All right, just wait outside.
Let me handle this.
Sorry about that.
I told you I don't know this person.
Okay, I understand.
So how is she paying your rent?
She's not paying my rent.
I don't know her.
Here is the document that agent Walker was referring to.
If you look, it clearly states that a Laura roderick paid last month's rent.
Well, uh, there must be some kind of a mistake.
Hey.
Is this yours?
What's your name?
Adam.
Hi, Adam.
My name is Sean.
Are you a friend of my mommy's?
Um, yeah.
Yeah, I am.

That's your mommy, right?
You're lucky.

Are you going to see her soon?
I don't know.
I hope so.
Can you take a picture of me?
Show her how big I got?
Sure.
Yeah.
Ready?

I'll show that to her.
I just wanted to make sure you got your music box back.
It's nice to meet you, Adam.
- Nice meeting you.
- Good-bye.
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.
Okay, what you're doing is aiding and abetting a felon.
That could land you in jail.
- Please go.
- I know why you won't talk.
You're Vicky's mother.
And you're trying to protect her along with your grandson Adam.
He's fine.
He's playing in his bedroom.
Where's your daughter, Mrs. Larson?
Please, no one's supposed to know... then stop playing games.
Or child protective services can determine whose custody he should be in.
I don't know where my daughter is.
She just contacts me every few months to check up on Adam.
Well, you must have some way to reach her.
I'm only supposed to call this in an emergency.
Please.
Don't do this.
Look, I know that this isn't your choice.
I know that somebody else is telling you to do this.
You don't have to listen to them.
Actually, I do.

You can let me go.
Stop talking.
Now turn around.
Turn around.

Nope.

And when he does, trust me, he'll come.
I hope you're calling with good news.
It worked.
She called Sean and left him a message.
As soon as he gets it, he'll be on his way.
When he gets there, take care of him.
This time for good.
Yes, sir.
- Previously on the event...
- Protecting the country
Involves the keeping of secrets, mr.
President.
- The president uncovered a conspiracy
That spans a century.
- How many prisoners?
- 97.
- Why are we holding them?
- They have a hidden agenda.
- The man at the center of it...
- Sean walker.
- Is on a search for his fiancee.
- I think they're gonna kill her.
- Sean, please come and get me.
- Sophia, the leader of a mysterious group of prisoners
Remains silent.
- I'm offering a deal.
- I can't defend this,
But I won't betray my people.
- And after plane meant to kill the president...
Jumped from miami to arizona in an instant...
- They're dead, sir.
Every last one of them.
- Could their deaths have been the result
Of whatever transported the plane here?
- The over 200 dead passengers
Took a strange turn.
- I-I need some people down here now!
- The event begins now.
[beeping car alarm] [alarm blares] [engine starts]
- All right.
[tires screech]
- Down!
[gunshots]
- I don't see anyone anymore.
But that doesn't mean anything.
Just drive.
- Where?
- Just anywhere away from here.
- The boyfriend got away.
- I spent time with walker.
He shouldn't have been a problem for you and smith.
- Yeah, well, he was.
But based on what we think he's told the fbi,
It's clear he's starting to put all this together.
You better move the girl.
[gunshots]
[tires screech] [bang]
- What are you doing?
- This is their car.
The shooters'.
Maybe there's something
That'll tell us who they are.
Damn it.
Nothing.
- Well, at least now you believe me.
- I haven't gotten that far.
- What's this guy doing?
- What?
- See this guy?
See how fast he's going?
- Yeah, yeah, I see him.
- It's him.
Go.
Go faster.
- What?
- Just go faster.
Okay, he's gaining.
Just--just floor it.
- I am.
[gunshots] - what are you waiting for?
Shoot him!
- I can't.
I can't.
Not at this distance.
- Well, so what do we do?
- Ah!
Okay, okay, just hit the brake hard.
- Did you say brake?
- Yes.
Then cut the wheel to the right.
Just trust me.
- Okay.
- Now!
[tires screech] [gunshots]
- I got him.
Go.
- Are you sure?
- Go!
- Got it.
All right, I disconnected the car's gps
So they can't track us.
Well, not using that anyway.
- I worked with those men for four years.
Day and night.
I want the people who did this.
I want them to pay.
You're going to tell me everything you know.
You understand?
- That's what I've been trying to do.
- So tell me, how do I find these bastards?
- Well...
Yeah.
Through her.
The woman who's holding leila.
- Vicky roberts.
- Or whatever her real name is.
These are the aliases that I pulled up.
We just have to hope that she's still
Using at least one of them.
- All right.
All right.
I'll make some phone calls and--
- No, you can't.
You can't.
You saw what happened when you called someone
About me.
- No, there's people I can trust.
My ex-husband works at justice.
- You know his social and date of birth?
- Yeah.
- Then I can get you into that database.
- Look, you've been lucky, okay?
But you have-- you have no training.
You're just-- you're not capable.
- I was capable enough to save your life.
Twice.
Listen, leila is out there somewhere,
And she's waiting for me.
And I'm not gonna let her down.

So you're gonna need to use this.
[bottle shatters] damn it.
Don't worry, leila.
You're gonna be fine.
If you behave yourself,
Nothing's going to happen to you.
We'll let you go.
You'll go on with your life.
Raise a bunch of babies.
Whatever.
And you'll forget all about this.
Do you believe me?
Nod your head so I know you believe me.
Good.
I'm glad we had this little chat.
- Oh, come on.
Are you really drinking again?
- I broke my last one.
- Yeah, so?
Then don't leave it on the floor.
Besides.
You shouldn't be drinking anyway.
You need to be alert.
- Why?
We're just waiting for the word.
She'll be dead in two hours.
- I noticed something wasn't right.
The seatbelt light was on, but a passenger got up anyway.
- Where am I?
I'm hungry.
I haven't had anything to eat.
- I was going to brazil
And the last thing I remember
Is taking off from miami international.
- I-I-I don't know what happened.
I've been trying to figure out what happened.
Why--why don't you tell me what happened?
- I remember shutting my eyes,
Willing myself to get there.
And then I opened them and I'm here.
- I want my mommy.
- I work for the damn government.
I expect you to tell me
What the hell's going on in here!
- Nobody will even tell me where I am.
Okay?
Does--does that seem normal to you?
- Nothing has been made clear.
- Why can't I remember anything about it?
[crying]
- I don't understand this.
I saw these people and they were dead.
- We ran high frequency pet scans on the passengers
For the autopsies.
And now having gotten the results,
We can see there's some evidence
Of mitochondrial activity.
- Are you saying they were still alive
And you didn't know it?
- I'm saying their vital signs were sub-viable.
There was no heartbeat, no pulse, no brain activity,
But something--some process was still going on
In their bodies.
- Meaning?
- At this point, sir, I would just be guessing.
We simply don't know what was done to them
And they can't tell us.
All the passengers remember is their take-off from miami.
- Okay.
Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you, doctor.
- Why?
Why do this?
Seemingly kill these people only to bring them back to us?
- Maybe it's a display of power.
Them showing us what they can do.
- To what end?
- 'scuse me a moment.
What is it?
- Mr. Vice president,
The pilot, michael buchanan, he's awake.
- Good.
I want to talk to him.
- There's a problem.
Director sterling is already in with him.
- Buchanan may hold the key to who was behind the plot
To kill the president.
Sterling's the last person we want him talking to about it.
- Mr. Buchanan, we already know you got on that plane
Intending to kill the president.
- They, uh, they killed my wife.
They took my daughters.
They were going to murder leila in front of me.
You do whatever you want to me.
But, please, just tell me my daughters are okay.
- Your daughters haven't been located yet, mr.
Buchanan, uh...
But I'll see what I can do to help.
In return,
I need you to tell me about the people behind this.
Who was forcing you to fly that plane
Into the presidental compound?
- I don't know who they are.
I don't even know what happened.
- Focus on the people who did this.
On what you know about them.
A name.
A conversation you overheard.
Please, mr.
Buchanan.
We need to find them.
- [sighs]
Leila knew the girl who was going to kill her.
Her name was vicky.
That's all I know.
- We'll talk again, mr.
Buchanan.
How long have you been standing there?
- Long enough to know
You've been keeping information from me.
Why wasn't I told you were interviewing the pilot?
- As we've discussed,
You're not running the investigation
Into the assassination attempt--I am.
- And you know how I feel about that.
- Oh, yes, I remember your insinuation quite clearly.
And I chose not to be offended by it.
- That's all you have to say?
- The president and I have our differences.
But the idea of me having anything to do
With trying to kill him...
Is absurd.
If only because that would put you in charge.
- There was this little girl.
She couldn't have been much older than david.
I saw her at the crash site lying there,
Her skin gray.
She was dead.
And then today, there she was.
She was standing there right in front of me.
- Hmm.
It's like a miracle.
- It's not a miracle.
It's not a miracle.
It's something else that sophia's people can do
That we just don't understand.
- Elias, it's natural for you to question this.
You feel betrayed.
But as scary as the past few days have been,
Everyone has come out of it alive.
Things could be a lot worse.
[cell phone vibrates]
- Yours?
- No, I don't think so.
[cell phone vibrates]
- Hello?
- David.
- David.
- David.
- Dad, it's for you.
- Who is this?
- I'm the man who pulled the plane out of the sky
To save your life.
- Secret service.
- I guess I should-- I should thank you.
But you know, you caused quite a scare
With what you did to those passengers.
- Hmm.
That was by design.
- I see.
Well, maybe you and I should sit down and talk.
Face-to-face just you and me.
- No.
There's been enough talk.
- What do you want?
- Release sophia and the rest of the detainees
Like you promised to.
- That promise was based on the premise
That we were both being honest with each other.
- Mr. President, I don't need to hear your excuses.
Release sophia and the detainees
Or this time people will die.
[beep beep] - oh, hold on.
Hold on.
Wi-fi.
Pull over.
Pull over.

It's amazing how many people
Still don't password-protect their wi-fi.
Clearly, they have no idea what lurks out there.
Okay.
We're in.
I used your ex's info to backdoor
The password recovery system.
So what now?
- Okay, look for bank accounts or credit cards
For any of the identities she's been using.
Then see if there's been any recent activity.
- Search protocol is pretty self-explanatory.
- So this is how you make a living?
- Well, I freelance writing code and making video games.
- Mm.
- Oh, here we go.
One of vicky's aliases, a laura roderick,
Just paid rent on a house last week in lubbock, texas.
And she used a credit card in that name
To buy groceries in the same area.
- So she's there now.
- But do you think leila could be there?
Last time anyone saw her, she was in miami.
- There's someone out there
That you're making very nervous,
So it makes sense that maybe they would've,
You know, moved her.
Either way, it's--it's a lead.

And flew domestic.
And that's when he took the job at avlas.

They, um, they move around a lot.

Move around a lot.
- Where are they spending thanksgiving?
- [nervous laughter] uh, you know, um...
To tell the truth, I-I...
Haven't really spoken to them in--in a while.
My--my parents split when I was a kid.
And my mom, she-- she wasn't, uh, well.
So, uh, my dad got full custody.
But then after the separation, he just kind of fell apart.
Started, uh, drinking and...
Anyway, I just was glad to be out of there
After high school.
I haven't really, um, spoken to them since.
And, yeah.
And I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to lie earlier.
I just felt weird, uh, telling you guys that stuff.
That's my story in a nutshell.
- [grunting]
- Room service.
Get the okay on the girl yet?
- Any minute.
- Just talked to lonner.
Apparently walker disabled the gps on the car.
And he figured out a way to jam his cell phone
So we won't be able to track him with that either.
- Told you walker wouldn't make it easy
To find him.
He's smart.
- There. 255.
Yellow house.
- Okay, drive past it and pull over here.
Curtains were closed.
I can't see what's going on inside.

Got it.
Understood.
Good to go on the girl.
- Finally.
- No, no, no.
I'll do it.
- Oh.
That's what I figured.
- Meaning?
- Meaning you got something personal with her, don't you?
- No.
It's never personal.
I just like to finish what I start.
- What?
- This is against everything I've been taught.
Going in alone.
- Well, we have no choice.
We know that they're monitoring the fbi
And probably the local police.
- Okay, you understand that we don't know
How many people might be in there, right?
- I know.
Which is why I think you should give me a gun.
- Without training,
You're more dangerous with a gun than not.
So just stay behind me
And keep those eyes open, all right?
- We're gonna need another car.
See what you can dig up.
- Fbi.
Are you alone in the house?
- We have a $67 billion intelligence budget
And we still can't trace a damn phone call?
These people got close enough to my son
To put a phone in his bag!
- We're looking into the possibility
It was done while david was in school
When the bag may have been left unattended.
- Which it shouldn't have been.
I want everyone on my son's secret service detail replaced.
I want security around him and christina
Increased immediately, understood?
I don't care how you do it,
But you're gonna find the man who made that call.
- Yes, sir.
- I want you to know every single agency
Under my purview is doing everything it can
To protect your family.
- All right.
We need to focus on the larger threat.
He said "people will die."
- Well, we've upped the threat level to orange,
Doubled air surveillance
And security at international checkpoints.
We are as ready for his next move as possible.
- They can transport an airliner 2,000 miles
In the blink of an eye.
We have no idea what else they can do.
- But we know they have some limits.
For instance, they can't transport sophia
And the detainees out of our custody
Or they would have done so by now.
- Any idea as to why they can't?
- Until we get real intelligence,
It's all just guesswork.
Unless we get sophia to talk.
- I don't know what to talk about
With this...
Person.
Is that what we call her?
A person?
- [chuckles] you're nervous.
- I know.
Why?
- I love it.
- I mean, I'm good at this.
Right?
I can talk to anyone.
- Babe, it's a meet and greet.
Bread and wine and some kind of tofu thing.
It'll be over before we know it.
- Oh, no.
She's a vegetarian?
- Vegan, apparently.
- Oh, forget it.
We have absolutely nothing in common.
- Come here.
Where are you going?
This way.
Come on.
- Oh, thank you.
It's all so delicious.
- That's because I had nothing to do with it.
- Ha.
I managed to marry a cuban girl who doesn't cook.
- So how did you two meet?
- Ah.
- Our mothers set us up.
- Ah.
They came over together from cuba
As teenagers on the same fishing boat.
- Yes.
- My mom was pregnant and very alone.
And christina's mom took care of her
During the trip.
- Then they lost touch when they got to miami.
But then 30 years lar,
They're standing in line for bocaditos
At la rosa bakery and, uh...
- And here we are.
[laughter]
- Amazing.
A refugee comes to this country pregnant,
Poor, alone, and a generation later,
Her son is the president.
This is why your country is truly great.
- I couldn't agree more.
- Mm-hmm.
- So you understand why I'm hopeful
That you will welcome my people the way that this country
Lcomed yours.
My dream is that one day my people
Will sit around a table like this
And tell their immigration stories
And it will seem no more strange
Than a tale of a fishing boat from cuba.
- I-I am sorry--I'm sorry that it's come to this.
- If you were so sorry, you would start talking.
Who made that call, sophia, and how do I stop them?
- You know that I can't-- - no, no, no.
It's not that you can't.
You won't.
You do exactly what you want, no matter the consequences.
Isn't that right?
- You-- - isn't that right?
- The plane.
The passengers.
It's all you.
You're pulling the strings.
- You're wrong.
I didn't condone any of this.
- You had one of your own killed because he was going to talk.
What?
Did you think I'd never figure that out?
Sophia...
You call yourself my friend.
If there's anything true to that,
If there's anything that's real that's left,
Please...
Tell me what you know.
- His name is thomas.
He is intelligent,
Charismatic.
A natural leader.
But we've always had different ideas
About how to adapt to our presence here.
He is less patient.
Impulsive.
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.
But whatever he's asking you for,
Give it to him.
- Well, what he wants...
Is you and the detainees.
That's not going to happen.
- Listen to me, elias,
I know him better than anyone.
You need to give him what he wants.
- Or what?
- I don't know.
But please, for the safety of your people,
Do what he says.
- [sniffs]
- Suki, I want you to go to ward one.
Jake, go to ward three, please.
- I'm positive.
I've never seen her before in my life.
- [scoffs] then why is she, uh, paying for you
To live here?
- [scoffs] I don't know what you're talking about.
- Well--
- Now, I have seen your credentials, agent collier.
But I don't believe I've ever seen yours.
Who are you?
- Agent walker.
- Agent walker must've left his badge in the car again.
Can we talk for a sec?
- What are you doing?
Lower the hammer on her.
She's obviously lying.
- And so are we.
If she figures out we're not here
On official fbi business,
She's gonna stop talking.
- So what do we do?
- All right, just wait outside.
Let me handle this.
Sorry about that.
- I told you I don't know this person.
- [shuts door loudly]
- Okay, I understand.
So how is she paying your rent?
- She's not paying my rent.
I don't know her.

Was referring to.

Or child protective services can determine whose custody
He should be in.

To check up on adam.
- Well, you must have some way to reach her.

As soon as he gets it, he'll be on his way.
- When he gets there, take care of him.
This time for good.
- Yes, sir.
I don't see anyone anymore.
But that doesn't mean anything.
Just drive.
Where?
Just anywhere away from here.
The boyfriend got away.
I spent time with Walker.
He shouldn't have been a problem for you and Smith.
Yeah, well, he was.
But based on what we think he's told the FBI, it's clear he's starting to put all this together.
You better move the girl.
- What are you doing?
- This is their car.
The shooters'.
Maybe there's something that'll tell us who they are.
Damn it.
Nothing.
Well, at least now you believe me.
I haven't gotten that far.
- What's this guy doing?
- What?
See this guy?
See how fast he's going?
Yeah, yeah, I see him.
- It's him.
Go.
Go faster.
- What?
Just go faster.
Okay, he's gaining.
- Just... just floor it.
- I am.
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him!
I can't.
I can't.
Not at this distance.
Well, so what do we do?
Ah!
Okay, okay, just hit the brake hard.
- Did you say brake?
- Yes.
Then cut the wheel to the right.
Just trust me.
- Okay.
- Now!
- I got him.
Go.
- Are you sure?
Go!
Got it.
All right, I disconnected the car's GPS so they can't track us.
Well, not using that anyway.
I worked with those men for four years.
Day and night.
I want the people who did this.
I want them to pay.
You're going to tell me everything you know.
You understand?
That's what I've been trying to do.
So tell me, how do I find these bastards?
Well...
Yeah.
Through her.
The woman who's holding leila.
Vicky Roberts.
Or whatever her real name is.
These are the aliases that I pulled up.
We just have to hope that she's still using at least one of them.
All right.
All right.
I'll make some phone calls and... no, you can't.
You can't.
You saw what happened when you called someone about me.
No, there's people I can trust.
My ex-husband works at justice.
You know his social and date of birth?
Yeah.
Then I can get you into that database.
Look, you've been lucky, okay?
But you have...
you have no training.
You're just...
you're not capable.
I was capable enough to save your life.
Twice.
Listen, leila is out there somewhere, and she's waiting for me.
And I'm not gonna let her down.

Yeah.
- Okay.

- Come with me.

Uh, I can't afford a plane ticket.
And I'm not gonna let you get me one either.
We'll drive.
Do you know how long that will take?
- 16 hours.

We'll get there just in time for Thanksgiving dinner.
Um...
Wow.

No, no, no, no.
God, no.

Unfortunately, toilet's broken.

You're gonna be fine.
If you behave yourself, nothing's going to happen to you.
We'll let you go.
You'll go on with your life.
Raise a bunch of babies.
Whatever.
And you'll forget all about this.
Do you believe me?
Nod your head so I know you believe me.
Good.
I'm glad we had this little chat.
Oh, come on.

- A Matter of Life and Death -
I noticed something wasn't right.
The seatbelt light was on, but a passenger got up anyway.
Where am I?
I'm hungry.
I haven't had anything to eat.
I was going to Brazil and the last thing I remember is taking off from Miami international.
- I-I-I don't know what happened.
I've been trying to figure out what happened.
Why... why don't you tell me what happened?
I remember shutting my eyes, willing myself to get there.
And then I opened them and I'm here.
I want my mommy.
I work for the damn government.
I expect you to tell me what the hell's going on in here!
Nobody will even tell me where I am.
Okay?
Does... does that seem normal to you?
Nothing has been made clear.
Why can't I remember anything about it?
I don't understand this.
I saw these people and they were dead.
We ran high frequency pet scans on the passengers for the autopsies.
And now having gotten the results, we can see there's some evidence of mitochondrial activity.
Are you saying they were still alive and you didn't know it?
- I'm saying their vital signs were sub-viable.
There was no heartbeat, no pulse, no brain activity, but something... some process was still going on in their bodies.
Meaning?
At this point, sir, I would just be guessing.
We simply don't know what was done to them and they can't tell us.
All the passengers remember is their take-off from Miami.
- Okay.
Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you, doctor.
Why?
Why do this?
Seemingly kill these people only to bring them back to us?
Maybe it's a display of power.
Them showing us what they can do.
To what end?
'Scuse me a moment.
What is it?
Mr. Vice president, the pilot, Michael Buchanan, he's awake.
Good.
I want to talk to him.
There's a problem.
Director sterling is already in with him.
Buchanan may hold the key to who was behind the plot to kill the president.
Sterling's the last person we want him talking to about it.
Mr. Buchanan, we already know you got on that plane intending to kill the president.
They, uh, they killed my wife.
They took my daughters.
They were going to murder Leila in front of me.
You do whatever you want to me.
But, please, just tell me my daughters are okay.
Your daughters haven't been located yet, Mr. Buchanan, uh...
But I'll see what I can do to help.
In return,
I need you to tell me about the people behind this.
Who was forcing you to fly that plane into the presidental compound?
I don't know who they are.
I don't even know what happened.
Focus on the people who did this.
On what you know about them.
A name.
A conversation you overheard.
Please, Mr. Buchanan.
We need to find them.
Leila knew the girl who was going to kill her.
Her name was Vicky.
That's all I know.
We'll talk again, Mr. Buchanan.
How long have you been standing there?
Long enough to know you've been keeping information from me.
Why wasn't I told you were interviewing the pilot?
As we've discussed, you're not running the investigation into the assassination attempt...
I am.
And you know how I feel about that.
Oh, yes, I remember your insinuation quite clearly.
And I chose not to be offended by it.
That's all you have to say?
The president and I have our differences.
But the idea of me having anything to do with trying to kill him...
Is absurd.
If only because that would put you in charge.
There was this little girl.
She couldn't have been much older than David.
I saw her at the crash site lying there, her skin gray.
She was dead.
And then today, there she was.
She was standing there right in front of me.
- Hmm.
It's like a miracle.
- It's not a miracle.
It's not a miracle.
It's something else that Sophia's people can do that we just don't understand.
Elias, it's natural for you to question this.
You feel betrayed.
But as scary as the past few days have been, everyone has come out of it alive.
Things could be a lot worse.
- Yours?
- No, I don't think so.
- Hello?
- David.
- David.
- David.
Dad, it's for you.
Who is this?
I'm the man who pulled the plane out of the sky to save your life.
Secret service.
I guess I should...
I should thank you.
But you know, you caused quite a scare with what you did to those passengers.
Hmm.
That was by design.
I see.
Well, maybe you and I should sit down and talk.
Face-to-face just you and me.
No.
There's been enough talk.
What do you want?
Release Sophia and the rest of the detainees like you promised to.
That promise was based on the premise that we were both being honest with each other.
Mr. President, I don't need to hear your excuses.
Release Sophia and the detainees or this time people will die.
Oh, hold on.
Hold on.
Wi-fi.
Pull over.
Pull over.
Found an unsecured node.
It's amazing how many people still don't password-protect their wi-fi.
Clearly, they have no idea what lurks out there.
Okay.
We're in.
I used your ex's info to backdoor the password recovery system.
So what now?
Okay, look for bank accounts or credit cards for any of the identities she's been using.
Then see if there's been any recent activity.
- Search protocol is pretty self-explanatory.
So this is how you make a living?
Well, I freelance writing code and making video games.
- Mm.
- Oh, here we go.
One of Vicky's aliases, a Laura roderick, just paid rent on a house last week in Lubbock, Texas.
And she used a credit card in that name to buy groceries in the same area.
So she's there now.
But do you think Leila could be there?
Last time anyone saw her, she was in Miami.
There's someone out there that you're making very nervous, so it makes sense that maybe they would've, you know, moved her.
Either way, it's... it's a lead.

They, um, they move around a lot.
For work or they just like to travel?
They just...
Move around a lot.
Where are they spending Thanksgiving?
Uh, you know, um...
To tell the truth, I-I...
Haven't really spoken to them in... in a while.
My... my parents split when I was a kid.
And my mom, she...
she wasn't, uh, well.
So, uh, my dad got full custody.
But then after the separation, he just kind of fell apart.
Started, uh, drinking and...
Anyway, I just was glad to be out of there after high school.
I haven't really, um, spoken to them since.
And, yeah.
And I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to lie earlier.
I just felt weird, uh, telling you guys that stuff.
That's my story in a nutshell.
Room service.
Get the okay on the girl yet?
Any minute.
Just talked to Lonner.
Apparently Walker disabled the GPS on the car.
And he figured out a way to jam his cell phone so we won't be able to track him with that either.
Told you Walker wouldn't make it easy to find him.
He's smart.
There. 255.
Yellow house.
Okay, drive past it and pull over here.
Curtains were closed.

Hello.

Understood.
Good to go on the girl.
- Finally.
- No, no, no.
I'll do it.
Oh.
That's what I figured.
Meaning?
Meaning you got something personal with her, don't you?
No.
It's never personal.
I just like to finish what I start.
What?
This is against everything I've been taught.
Going in alone.
Well, we have no choice.
We know that they're monitoring the FBI and probably the local police.
Okay, you understand that we don't know how many people might be in there, right?
I know.
Which is why I think you should give me a gun.
Without training, you're more dangerous with a gun than not.
So just stay behind me and keep those eyes open, all right?
We're gonna need another car.
See what you can dig up.
FBI.
Are you alone in the house?
We have a $67 billion intelligence budget and we still can't trace a damn phone call?
These people got close enough to my son to put a phone in his bag!
We're looking into the possibility it was done while David was in school when the bag may have been left unattended.
Which it shouldn't have been.
I want everyone on my son's secret service detail replaced.
I want security around him and Christina increased immediately, understood?
I don't care how you do it, but you're gonna find the man who made that call.
Yes, sir.
I want you to know every single agency under my purview is doing everything it can to protect your family.
All right.
We need to focus on the larger threat.
He said "people will die."
Well, we've upped the threat level to orange, doubled air surveillance and security at international checkpoints.
We are as ready for his next move as possible.
They can transport an airliner 2,000 miles in the blink of an eye.
We have no idea what else they can do.
But we know they have some limits.
For instance, they can't transport Sophia and the detainees out of our custody or they would have done so by now.
Any idea as to why they can't?
Until we get real intelligence, it's all just guesswork.
Unless we get Sophia to talk.
I don't know what to talk about with this...
Person.
Is that what we call her?
A person?
- You're nervous.
- I know.
Why?
- I love it.
- I mean, I'm good at this.
Right?
I can talk to anyone.
Babe, it's a meet and greet.
Bread and wine and some kind of tofu thing.
It'll be over before we know it.
Oh, no.
She's a vegetarian?
- Vegan, apparently.
- Oh, forget it.
We have absolutely nothing in common.
Come here.
Where are you going?
This way.
Come on.
Oh, thank you.
It's all so delicious.
That's because I had nothing to do with it.
Ha.
I managed to marry a Cuban girl who doesn't cook.
So how did you two meet?
- Ah.
- Our mothers set us up.
Ah.
They came over together from Cuba as teenagers on the same fishing boat.
Yes.
My mom was pregnant and very alone.
And Christina's mom took care of her during the trip.
Then they lost touch when they got to Miami.
But then 30 years later, they're standing in line for bocaditos at La Rosa bakery and, uh...
And here we are.
Amazing.
A refugee comes to this country pregnant, poor, alone, and a generation later, her son is the president.
This is why your country is truly great.
- I couldn't agree more.
- Mm-hmm.
So you understand why I'm hopeful that you will welcome my people the way that this country welcomed yours.
My dream is that one day my people will sit around a table like this and tell their immigration stories and it will seem no more strange than a tale of a fishing boat from Cuba.
- I-I am sorry...
I'm sorry that it's come to this.
If you were so sorry, you would start talking.
Who made that call, Sophia, and how do I stop them?
- You know that I can't...
- No, no, no.
It's not that you can't.
You won't.
You do exactly what you want, no matter the consequences.
Isn't that right?
- You...
- Isn't that right?
The plane.
The passengers.
It's all you.
You're pulling the strings.
You're wrong.
I didn't condone any of this.
You had one of your own killed because he was going to talk.
What?
Did you think I'd never figure that out?
Sophia...
You call yourself my friend.
If there's anything true to that, if there's anything that's real that's left, please...
Tell me what you know.
His name is Thomas.
He is intelligent, charismatic.
A natural leader.
But we've always had different ideas about how to adapt to our presence here.
He is less patient.
Impulsive.
Where is he now?
I don't know.
But whatever he's asking you for, give it to him.
Well, what he wants...
Is you and the detainees.
That's not going to happen.
Listen to me, Elias,
I know him better than anyone.
You need to give him what he wants.
- Or what?
- I don't know.
But please, for the safety of your people, do what he says.
Suki, I want you to go to ward one.
Jake, go to ward three, please.
I'm positive.
I've never seen her before in my life.
Then why is she, uh, paying for you to live here?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well... now, I have seen your credentials, agent Collier.
But I don't believe I've ever seen yours.
Who are you?
Agent Walker.
Agent Walker must've left his badge in the car again.
Can we talk for a sec?
What are you doing?
Lower the hammer on her.
She's obviously lying.
And so are we.
If she figures out we're not here on official FBI business, she's gonna stop talking.
So what do we do?
All right, just wait outside.
Let me handle this.
Sorry about that.
I told you I don't know this person.
Okay, I understand.
So how is she paying your rent?
She's not paying my rent.
I don't know her.
Here is the document that agent Walker was referring to.
If you look, it clearly states that a Laura roderick paid last month's rent.
Well, uh, there must be some kind of a mistake.
Hey.
Is this yours?
What's your name?
Adam.
Hi, Adam.
My name is Sean.

Um, yeah.
Yeah, I am.

Show her how big I got?
Sure.
Yeah.

I just wanted to make sure you got your music box back.
It's nice to meet you, Adam.
- Nice meeting you.
- Good-bye.
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.
Okay, what you're doing is aiding and abetting a felon.
That could land you in jail.
- Please go.
- I know why you won't talk.
You're Vicky's mother.
And you're trying to protect her along with your grandson Adam.
He's fine.
He's playing in his bedroom.
Where's your daughter, Mrs. Larson?
Please, no one's supposed to know... then stop playing games.
Or child protective services can determine whose custody he should be in.
I don't know where my daughter is.
She just contacts me every few months to check up on Adam.
Well, you must have some way to reach her.
I'm only supposed to call this in an emergency.
Please.
Don't do this.
Look, I know that this isn't your choice.
I know that somebody else is telling you to do this.
You don't have to listen to them.
Actually, I do.

But she left a message.
You're gonna be fine.
Ugh!

Whatever.
Well, let's just hope Walker gets the message.
Otherwise, I'm not sure how we're gonna find him.

Protecting the country involves the keeping of secrets, Mr. President.
The president uncovered a conspiracy that spans a century.
- How many prisoners?
- 97.
- Why are we holding them?
- They have a hidden agenda.
- The man at the centre of it...
- Sean Walker.
Is on a search for his fiancee.
I think they're goanna kill her.
Sean, please come and get me.
Sophia, the leader of a mysterious group of prisoners remains silent.
I'm offering a deal.
I can't defend this, but I won't betray my people.
And after plane meant to kill the president...
Jumped from Miami to Arizona in an instant...
They're dead, sir.
Every last one of them.
Could their deaths have been the result of whatever transported the plane here?
The over 200 dead passengers took a strange turn.
- I-I need some people down here now!
The event begins now.
All right.
Down!
I don't see anyone anymore.
But that doesn't mean anything.
Just drive.
Where?
Just anywhere away from here.
The boyfriend got away.
I spent time with Walker.
He shouldn't have been a problem for you and Smith.
Yeah, well, he was.
But based on what we think he's told the FBI, it's clear he's starting to put all this together.
You better move the girl.
- What are you doing?
- This is their car.
The shooters'.
Maybe there's something that'll tell us who they are.
Damn it.
Nothing.
Well, at least now you believe me.
I haven't gotten that far.
- What's this guy doing?
- What?
See this guy?
See how fast he's going?
Yeah, yeah, I see him.
- It's him.
Go.
Go faster.
- What?
Just go faster.
Okay, he's gaining.
- Just... just floor it.
- I am.
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him!
I can't.
I can't.
Not at this distance.
Well, so what do we do?
Ah!
Okay, okay, just hit the brake hard.
- Did you say brake?
- Yes.
Then cut the wheel to the right.
Just trust me.
- Okay.
- Now!
- I got him.
Go.
- Are you sure?
Go!
Got it.
All right, I disconnected the car's GPS so they can't track us.
Well, not using that anyway.
I worked with those men for four years.
Day and night.
I want the people who did this.
I want them to pay.
You're going to tell me everything you know.
You understand?
That's what I've been trying to do.
So tell me, how do I find these bastards?
Well...
Yeah.
Through her.
The woman who's holding Leila.
Vicky Roberts.
Or whatever her real name is.
These are the aliases that I pulled up.
We just have to hope that she's still using at least one of them.
All right.
All right.
I'll make some phone calls and... no, you can't.
You can't.
You saw what happened when you called someone about me.
No, there's people I can trust.
My ex-husband works at justice.
You know his social and date of birth?
Yeah.
Then I can get you into that database.
Look, you've been lucky, okay?
But you have...
you have no training.
You're just...
you're not capable.
I was capable enough to save your life.
Twice.
Listen, Leila is out there somewhere, and she's waiting for me.
And I'm not goanna let her down.

- Yes.
- Come with me.
Come with you.
Uh, I can't afford a plane ticket.
And I'm not goanna let you get me one either.
We'll drive.
Do you know how long that will take?
- 16 hours.
- Okay.
We'll get there just in time for Thanksgiving dinner.
Um...
Wow.
What?
Is it me?
No, no, no, no.
God, no.
You're... you're perfect.
Um...
Then what?
Uh...
Okay.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Let's, uh, let's do it.
- All right.
- Okay.
Thanksgiving dinner.
Would you do the honours?
Thank you.
Ah.
Lovely radio.
¶¶
step.
Step.
Three more.
Ugh!
Beer's for me.
Can we just get this done already?
Unfortunately, toilet's broken.
So you're goanna need to use this.
Damn it.
Don't worry, Leila.
You're goanna be fine.
If you behave yourself, nothing's going to happen to you.
We'll let you go.
You'll go on with your life.
Raise a bunch of babies.
Whatever.
And you'll forget all about this.
Do you believe me?
Nod your head so I know you believe me.
Good.
I'm glad we had this little chat.
Oh, come on.
Are you really drinking again?
- I broke my last one.
- Yeah, so?
Then don't leave it on the floor.
Besides.
You shouldn't be drinking anyway.
You need to be alert.
Why?
We're just waiting for the word.
She'll be dead in two hours.
I noticed something wasn't right.
The seatbelt light was on, but a passenger got up anyway.
Where am I?
I'm hungry.
I haven't had anything to eat.
I was going to Brazil and the last thing I remember is taking off from Miami international.
- I-I-I don't know what happened.
I've been trying to figure out what happened.
Why... why don't you tell me what happened?
I remember shutting my eyes, willing myself to get there.
And then I opened them and I'm here.
I want my mommy.
I work for the damn government.
I expect you to tell me what the hell's going on in here!
Nobody will even tell me where I am.
Okay?
Does... does that seem normal to you?
Nothing has been made clear.
Why can't I remember anything about it?
I don't understand this.
I saw these people and they were dead.
We ran high frequency pet scans on the passengers for the autopsies.
And now having gotten the results, we can see there's some evidence of mitochondrial activity.
Are you saying they were still alive and you didn't know it?
- I'm saying their vital signs were sub-viable.
There was no heartbeat, no pulse, no brain activity, but something... some process was still going on in their bodies.
Meaning?
At this point, sir, I would just be guessing.
We simply don't know what was done to them and they can't tell us.
All the passengers remember is their take-off from Miami.
- Okay.
Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you, doctor.
Why?
Why do this?
Seemingly kill these people only to bring them back to us?
Maybe it's a display of power.
Them showing us what they can do.
To what end?
'Scuse me a moment.
What is it?
Mr. Vice president, the pilot, Michael Buchanan, he's awake.
Good.
I want to talk to him.
There's a problem.
Director sterling is already in with him.
Buchanan may hold the key to who was behind the plot to kill the president.
Sterling's the last person we want him talking to about it.
Mr. Buchanan, we already know you got on that plane intending to kill the president.
They, uh, they killed my wife.
They took my daughters.
They were going to murder Leila in front of me.
You do whatever you want to me.
But, please, just tell me my daughters are okay.
Your daughters haven't been located yet, Mr. Buchanan, uh...
But I'll see what I can do to help.
In return,
I need you to tell me about the people behind this.
Who was forcing you to fly that plane into the presidential compound?
I don't know who they are.
I don't even know what happened.
Focus on the people who did this.
On what you know about them.
A name.
A conversation you overheard.
Please, Mr. Buchanan.
We need to find them.
Leila knew the girl who was going to kill her.
Her name was Vicky.
That's all I know.
We'll talk again, Mr. Buchanan.
How long have you been standing there?
Long enough to know you've been keeping information from me.
Why wasn't I told you were interviewing the pilot?
As we've discussed, you're not running the investigation into the assassination attempt...
I am.
And you know how I feel about that.
Oh, yes, I remember your insinuation quite clearly.
And I chose not to be offended by it.
That's all you have to say?
The president and I have our differences.
But the idea of me having anything to do with trying to kill him...
Is absurd.
If only because that would put you in charge.
There was this little girl.
She couldn't have been much older than David.
I saw her at the crash site lying there, her skin gray.
She was dead.
And then today, there she was.
She was standing there right in front of me.
- Hmm.
It's like a miracle.
- It's not a miracle.
It's not a miracle.
It's something else that Sophia's people can do that we just don't understand.
Elias, it's natural for you to question this.
You feel betrayed.
But as scary as the past few days have been, everyone has come out of it alive.
Things could be a lot worse.
- Yours?
- No, I don't think so.
- Hello?
- David.
- David.
- David.
Dad, it's for you.
Who is this?
I'm the man who pulled the plane out of the sky to save your life.
Secret service.
I guess I should...
I should thank you.
But you know, you caused quite a scare with what you did to those passengers.
Hmm.
That was by design.
I see.
Well, maybe you and I should sit down and talk.
Face-to-face just you and me.
No.
There's been enough talk.
What do you want?
Release Sophia and the rest of the detainees like you promised to.
That promise was based on the premise that we were both being honest with each other.
Mr. President, I don't need to hear your excuses.
Release Sophia and the detainees or this time people will die.
Oh, hold on.
Hold on.
Wi-Fi.
Pull over.
Pull over.
Found an unsecured node.
It's amazing how many people still don't password-protect their Wi-Fi.
Clearly, they have no idea what lurks out there.
Okay.
We're in.
I used your ex's info to backdoor the password recovery system.
So what now?
Okay, look for bank accounts or credit cards for any of the identities she's been using.
Then see if there's been any recent activity.
- Search protocol is pretty self-explanatory.
So this is how you make a living?
Well, I freelance writing code and making video games.
- Mm.
- Oh, here we go.
One of Vicky's aliases, a Laura Roderick, just paid rent on a house last week in Lubbock, Texas.
And she used a credit card in that name to buy groceries in the same area.
So she's there now.
But do you think Leila could be there?
Last time anyone saw her, she was in Miami.
There's someone out there that you're making very nervous, so it makes sense that maybe they would've, you know, moved her.
Either way, it's... it's a lead.
¶¶
Val, they're here!
- Just in time for dinner.
- Yeah.
- Hey, pumpkin.
- Hey, dad.
Sweetheart.
Good to see you, sweetheart.
- Nice to see you.
- How are you, baby?
Great.
Thank you.
Dad, this is Sean.
Hi.
Sean.
Nice to meet you.
John, nice to meet you.
Come on in.
Sean.
Well, Michael flew international forever till Leila was, like, ten.
And then finally, he made the switch and flew domestic.
And that's when he took the job at Avias.
- Ooh, should I check on Sam?
- No, no, no.
She's fine.
It's good that she finally fell asleep.
If she doesn't get her afternoon nap, she is so crabby.
I'm exactly the same way so...
He's not joking.
Everything tastes fantastic.
And these...
this sweet potato thing is delicious.
Oh, thank you so much.
Well, Sean, it must be hard on your folks not having you around for the holiday.
Uh, it is.
But, um, you know, they're kind of used to it.
Where do they live?
Uh, here and there, you know.
They, um, they move around a lot.
For work or they just like to travel?
They just...
Move around a lot.
Where are they spending Thanksgiving?
Uh, you know, um...
To tell the truth, I-I...
Haven't really spoken to them in... in a while.
My... my parents split when I was a kid.
And my mom, she...
she wasn't, uh, well.
So, uh, my dad got full custody.
But then after the separation, he just kind of fell apart.
Started, uh, drinking and...
Anyway, I just was glad to be out of there after high school.
I haven't really, um, spoken to them since.
And, yeah.
And I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to lie earlier.
I just felt weird, uh, telling you guys that stuff.
That's my story in a nutshell.
Room service.
Get the okay on the girl yet?
Any minute.
Just talked to Loner.
Apparently Walker disabled the GPS on the car.
And he figured out a way to jam his cell phone so we won't be able to track him with that either.
Told you Walker wouldn't make it easy to find him.
He's smart.
There. 255.
Yellow house.
Okay, drive past it and pull over here.
Curtains were closed.
I can't see what's going on inside.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
Hello.
Got it.
Understood.
Good to go on the girl.
- Finally.
- No, no, no.
I'll do it.
Oh.
That's what I figured.
Meaning?
Meaning you got something personal with her, don't you?
No.
It's never personal.
I just like to finish what I start.
What?
This is against everything I've been taught.
Going in alone.
Well, we have no choice.
We know that they're monitoring the FBI and probably the local police.
Okay, you understand that we don't know how many people might be in there, right?
I know.
Which is why I think you should give me a gun.
Without training, you're more dangerous with a gun than not.
So just stay behind me and keep those eyes open, all right?
We're goanna need another car.
See what you can dig up.
FBI.
Are you alone in the house?
We have a $67 billion intelligence budget and we still can't trace a damn phone call?
These people got close enough to my son to put a phone in his bag!
We're looking into the possibility it was done while David was in school when the bag may have been left unattended.
Which it shouldn't have been.
I want everyone on my son's secret service detail replaced.
I want security around him and Christina increased immediately, understood?
I don't care how you do it, but you're goanna find the man who made that call.
Yes, sir.
I want you to know every single agency under my purview is doing everything it can to protect your family.
All right.
We need to focus on the larger threat.
He said "people will die."
Well, we've upped the threat level to orange, doubled air surveillance and security at international checkpoints.
We are as ready for his next move as possible.
They can transport an airliner 2,000 miles in the blink of an eye.
We have no idea what else they can do.
But we know they have some limits.
For instance, they can't transport Sophia and the detainees out of our custody or they would have done so by now.
Any idea as to why they can't?
Until we get real intelligence, it's all just guesswork.
Unless we get Sophia to talk.
I don't know what to talk about with this...
Person.
Is that what we call her?
A person?
- You're nervous.
- I know.
Why?
- I love it.
- I mean, I'm good at this.
Right?
I can talk to anyone.
Babe, it's a meet and greet.
Bread and wine and some kind of tofu thing.
It'll be over before we know it.
Oh, no.
She's a vegetarian?
- Vegan, apparently.
- Oh, forget it.
We have absolutely nothing in common.
Come here.
Where are you going?
This way.
Come on.
Oh, thank you.
It's all so delicious.
That's because I had nothing to do with it.
Ha.
I managed to marry a Cuban girl who doesn't cook.
So how did you two meet?
- Ah.
- Our mothers set us up.
Ah.
They came over together from Cuba as teenagers on the same fishing boat.
Yes.
My mom was pregnant and very alone.
And Christina's mom took care of her during the trip.
Then they lost touch when they got to Miami.
But then 30 years later, they're standing in line for bocaditos at La Rosa bakery and, uh...
And here we are.
Amazing.
A refugee comes to this country pregnant, poor, alone, and a generation later, her son is the president.
This is why your country is truly great.
- I couldn't agree more.
- Mm-hmm.
So you understand why I'm hopeful that you will welcome my people the way that this country welcomed yours.
My dream is that one day my people will sit around a table like this and tell their immigration stories and it will seem no more strange than a tale of a fishing boat from Cuba.
- I-I am sorry...
I'm sorry that it's come to this.
If you were so sorry, you would start talking.
Who made that call, Sophia, and how do I stop them?
- You know that I can't...
- No, no, no.
It's not that you can't.
You won't.
You do exactly what you want, no matter the consequences.
Isn't that right?
- You...
- Isn't that right?
The plane.
The passengers.
It's all you.
You're pulling the strings.
You're wrong.
I didn't condone any of this.
You had one of your own killed because he was going to talk.
What?
Did you think I'd never figure that out?
Sophia...
You call yourself my friend.
If there's anything true to that, if there's anything that's real that's left, please...
Tell me what you know.
His name is Thomas.
He is intelligent, charismatic.
A natural leader.
But we've always had different ideas about how to adapt to our presence here.
He is less patient.
Impulsive.
Where is he now?
I don't know.
But whatever he's asking you for, give it to him.
Well, what he wants...
Is you and the detainees.
That's not going to happen.
Listen to me, Elias,
I know him better than anyone.
You need to give him what he wants.
- Or what?
- I don't know.
But please, for the safety of your people, do what he says.
Suki, I want you to go to ward one.
Jake, go toward three, please.
I'm positive.
I've never seen her before in my life.
Then why is she, uh, paying for you to live here?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well... now, I have seen your credentials, agent Collier.
But I don't believe I've ever seen yours.
Who are you?
Agent Walker.
Agent Walker must've left his badge in the car again.
Can we talk for a sec?
What are you doing?
Lower the hammer on her.
She's obviously lying.
And so are we.
If she figures out we're not here on official FBI business, she's goanna stop talking.
So what do we do?
All right, just wait outside.
Let me handle this.
Sorry about that.
I told you I don't know this person.
Okay, I understand.
So how is she paying your rent?
She's not paying my rent.
I don't know her.
Here is the document that agent Walker was referring to.
If you look, it clearly states that a Laura Roderick paid last month's rent.
Well, uh, there must be some kind of a mistake.
Hey.
Is this yours?
What's your name?
Adam.
Hi, Adam.
My name is Sean.
Are you a friend of my mommy's?
Um, yeah.
Yeah, I am.
I have a picture of us, actually.
That's your mommy, right?
You're lucky.
Grandma says we can't keep real pictures of her.
Are you going to see her soon?
I don't know.
I hope so.
Can you take a picture of me?
Show her how big I got?
Sure.
Yeah.
Ready?
Smile.
Got a good one.
Can I see?
Sure.
All right.
I'll show that to her.
I just wanted to make sure you got your music box back.
It's nice to meet you, Adam.
- Nice meeting you.
- Good-bye.
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.
Okay, what you're doing is aiding and abetting a felon.
That could land you in jail.
- Please go.
- I know why you won't talk.
You're Vicky's mother.
And you're trying to protect her along with your grandson Adam.
He's fine.
He's playing in his bedroom.
Where's your daughter, Mrs. Larson?
Please, no one's supposed to know... then stop playing games.
Or child protective services can determine whose custody he should be in.
I don't know where my daughter is.
She just contacts me every few months to check up on Adam.
Well, you must have some way to reach her.
I'm only supposed to call this in an emergency.
Please.
Don't do this.
Look, I know that this isn't your choice.
I know that somebody else is telling you to do this.
You don't have to listen to them.
Actually, I do.
- I-I don't even know who you are.
You can let me go.
Stop talking.
Now turn around.
Turn around.
Oh!
Police!
Stop!
Stay right there.
Please help me!
Please help me.
He's after me.
Who... who is after you?
- He's after me, he's coming...
- Who's coming?
I was kidnapped, and I...
and I just shot somebody.
You shot somebody.
You were kidnapped, and you shot somebody.
I shot somebody just now.
All right, fine.
Just calm down.
Calm down?
Are you listening to what I'm saying?
I am trying to listen to you, but you're not making sense.
I need to go with you.
Please, just take me with you!
All right.
Dispatch, this is unit 7.
Coming home with a possible 10-96.
Over.
Copy that, unit 7.
She says she was kidnapped.
And she shot one of her captors in self-defence.
Any reports of shots being fired?
Nope.
What do you think?
I'm not sure.
But that's what she believes.
Well, I can get a psych consult in here, but not till tomorrow morning.
She got anywhere to go?
There is one person she wants to call.
Let her.
And see if she can give you a description of these captors.
Here ya go.
720 area code.
That's, uh, Colorado.
My ex-husband did a stint in Denver.
None of Vicky's previous aliases had addresses in Colorado, right?
This could be a new one.
She could be there.
Hi, this is Sean.
Leave a message.
Sean?
Sean, it's me.
I'm...
I'm okay.
I'm safe.
I'm...
I'm in this police station.
In, uh, in this...
in this town.
Snyder.
In Texas.
And, um...
I got away.
I got away, and I...
I don't think that the police believe me.
And what happened.
Any of it.
Sean, please come and get me.
Please come and get me, okay?
I love you.
Mom, weren't you goanna show me that thing?
Right, yeah, the thing.
What, so, what's the verdict?
Do you think dad likes him?
I don't know, but he has got my seal of approval.
I think you picked a really good one, honey.
I'm so happy for you.
Baby.
I've got something I think you're goanna like.
Listen, I didn't mean to put you on the spot earlier.
I just like to know who my daughter's dating.
Oh...
It's fine.
Leila really likes you.
And you seem like a decent guy.
You are a decent guy, right?
Uh, I...
I like to think so.
Good, well, make my daughter happy, treat her with respect...
And that is all I ask.
Scotch.
Now, that is a serious drink.
Sean...
Try this.
Very rare stuff.
Gift from a friend.
Hmm.
You ready?
Yes, I am.
Welcome to the family.
Well...
Thanks.
Hey, miss.
Can I get you some water or tea?
I might have some tea back there.
Just have some water.
Thanks.
Sure.
I'll just be a minute.
She made the call, but Walker didn't pick up.
But she left a message.
You're goanna be fine.
Ugh!
You'll go on with your life.
Raise a bunch of babies.
Whatever.
Well, let's just hope Walker gets the message.
Otherwise, I'm not sure how we're goanna find him.
He'll get it.
And when he does, trust me, he'll come.
I hope you're calling with good news.
It worked.
She called Sean and left him a message.
As soon as he gets it, he'll be on his way.
When he gets there, take care of him.
This time for good.
Yes, sir.
Previously on the event...
Protecting the country
Involves the keeping of secrets, mr.
President.
- The president uncovered a conspiracy
That spans a century.
- How many prisoners?
- 97.
- Why are we holding them?
- They have a hidden agenda.
- The man at the center of it...
- Sean walker.
- Is on a search for his fiancee.
- I think they're gonna kill her.
- Sean, please come and get me.
- Sophia, the leader of a mysterious group of prisoners
Remains silent.
I'm offering a deal.
I can't defend this,
But I won't betray my people.
- And after plane meant to kill the president...
Jumped from miami to arizona in an instant...
- They're dead, sir.
Every last one of them.
- Could their deaths have been the result
Of whatever transported the plane here?
- The over 200 dead passengers
Took a strange turn.
- I-I need some people down here now!
The event begins now.
All right.
Down!
- I don't see anyone anymore.
But that doesn't mean anything.
Just drive.
- Where?
- Just anywhere away from here.
The boyfriend got away.
I spent time with walker.
He shouldn't have been a problem for you and smith.
Yeah, well, he was.
But based on what we think he's told the fbi,
It's clear he's starting to put all this together.
You better move the girl.
- What are you doing?
- This is their car.
The shooters'.
Maybe there's something
That'll tell us who they are.
Damn it.
Nothing.
- Well, at least now you believe me.
I haven't gotten that far.
- What's this guy doing?
- What?
See this guy?
See how fast he's going?
- Yeah, yeah, I see him.
- It's him.
Go.
Go faster.
- What?
Just go faster.
Okay, he's gaining.
Just-- just floor it.
- I am.
what are you waiting for?
Shoot him!
- I can't.
I can't.
Not at this distance.
Well, so what do we do?
Ah!
Okay, okay, just hit the brake hard.
- Did you say brake?
- Yes.
Then cut the wheel to the right.
Just trust me.
- Okay.
- Now!
- I got him.
Go.
- Are you sure?
Go!
Got it.
All right, I disconnected the car's gps
So they can't track us.
Well, not using that anyway.
- I worked with those men for four years.
Day and night.
I want the people who did this.
I want them to pay.
You're going to tell me everything you know.
You understand?
- That's what I've been trying to do.
- So tell me, how do I find these bastards?
Well...
Yeah.
Through her.
The woman who's holding leila.
Vicky roberts.
- Or whatever her real name is.
These are the aliases that I pulled up.
We just have to hope that she's still
Using at least one of them.
- All right.
All right.
I'll make some phone calls and--
- No, you can't.
You can't.
You saw what happened when you called someone
About me.
- No, there's people I can trust.
My ex-husband works at justice.
- You know his social and date of birth?
Yeah.
- Then I can get you into that database.
- Look, you've been lucky, okay?
But you have-- you have no training.
You're just-- you're not capable.
- I was capable enough to save your life.
Twice.
Listen, leila is out there somewhere,
And she's waiting for me.
And I'm not gonna let her down.

Are you ready?

Uh, I can't afford a plane ticket.
And I'm not gonna let you get me one either.
We'll drive.
Do you know how long
That will take?

Besides.
You shouldn't be drinking anyway.
You need to be alert.

I'm hungry.
I haven't had anything to eat.
I was going to brazil
And the last thing I remember
Is taking off from miami international.

I've been trying to figure out what happened.
Why-- why don't you tell me what happened?
I remember shutting my eyes,
Willing myself to get there.
And then I opened them and I'm here.
I want my mommy.
- I work for the damn government.
I expect you to tell me
What the hell's going on in here!
- Nobody will even tell me where I am.
Okay?
Does-- does that seem normal to you?
Nothing has been made clear.
- Why can't I remember anything about it?
I don't understand this.
I saw these people and they were dead.
- We ran high frequency pet scans on the passengers
For the autopsies.
And now having gotten the results,
We can see there's some evidence
Of mitochondrial activity.
- Are you saying they were still alive
And you didn't know it?
- I'm saying their vital signs were sub-viable.
There was no heartbeat, no pulse, no brain activity,
But something-- some process was still going on
In their bodies.
Meaning?
- At this point, sir, I would just be guessing.
We simply don't know what was done to them
And they can't tell us.
All the passengers remember is their take-off from miami.
- Okay.
Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you, doctor.
Why?
Why do this?
Seemingly kill these people only to bring them back to us?
- Maybe it's a display of power.
Them showing us what they can do.
To what end?
'scuse me a moment.
What is it?
Mr. Vice president,
The pilot, michael buchanan, he's awake.
- Good.
I want to talk to him.
There's a problem.
Director sterling is already in with him.
- Buchanan may hold the key to who was behind the plot
To kill the president.
Sterling's the last person we want him talking to about it.
- Mr. Buchanan, we already know you got on that plane
Intending to kill the president.
- They, uh, they killed my wife.
They took my daughters.
They were going to murder leila in front of me.
You do whatever you want to me.
But, please, just tell me my daughters are okay.
- Your daughters haven't been located yet, mr.
Buchanan, uh...
But I'll see what I can do to help.
In return,
I need you to tell me about the people behind this.
Who was forcing you to fly that plane
Into the presidental compound?
- I don't know who they are.
I don't even know what happened.
- Focus on the people who did this.
On what you know about them.
A name.
A conversation you overheard.
Please, mr.
Buchanan.
We need to find them.
Leila knew the girl who was going to kill her.
Her name was vicky.
That's all I know.
- We'll talk again, mr.
Buchanan.
How long have you been standing there?
Long enough to know
You've been keeping information from me.
Why wasn't I told you were interviewing the pilot?
As we've discussed,
You're not running the investigation
Into the assassination attempt-
- I am.
- And you know how I feel about that.
- Oh, yes, I remember your insinuation quite clearly.
And I chose not to be offended by it.
- That's all you have to say?
- The president and I have our differences.
But the idea of me having anything to do
With trying to kill him...
Is absurd.
If only because that would put you in charge.
There was this little girl.
She couldn't have been much older than david.
I saw her at the crash site lying there,
Her skin gray.
She was dead.
And then today, there she was.
She was standing there right in front of me.
- Hmm.
It's like a miracle.
- It's not a miracle.
It's not a miracle.
It's something else that sophia's people can do
That we just don't understand.
- Elias, it's natural for you to question this.
You feel betrayed.
But as scary as the past few days have been,
Everyone has come out of it alive.
Things could be a lot worse.
- Yours?
- No, I don't think so.
- Hello?
- David.
- David.
- David.
Dad, it's for you.
Who is this?
- I'm the man who pulled the plane out of the sky
To save your life.
Secret service.
- I guess I should-- I should thank you.
But you know, you caused quite a scare
With what you did to those passengers.
Hmm.
That was by design.
I see.
Well, maybe you and I should sit down and talk.
Face-to-face just you and me.
- No.
There's been enough talk.
What do you want?
- Release sophia and the rest of the detainees
Like you promised to.
- That promise was based on the premise
That we were both being honest with each other.
- Mr. President, I don't need to hear your excuses.
Release sophia and the detainees
Or this time people will die.
oh, hold on.
Hold on.
Wi-fi.
Pull over.
Pull over.
Found an unsecured node.
It's amazing how many people
Still don't password-protect their wi-fi.
Clearly, they have no idea what lurks out there.
Okay.
We're in.
I used your ex's info to backdoor
The password recovery system.
So what now?
- Okay, look for bank accounts or credit cards
For any of the identities she's been using.
Then see if there's been any recent activity.
- Search protocol is pretty self-explanatory.
- So this is how you make a living?
- Well, I freelance writing code and making video games.
- Mm.
- Oh, here we go.
One of vicky's aliases, a laura roderick,
Just paid rent on a house last week in lubbock, texas.
And she used a credit card in that name
To buy groceries in the same area.
So she's there now.
- But do you think leila could be there?
Last time anyone saw her, she was in miami.
There's someone out there
That you're making very nervous,
So it makes sense that maybe they would've,
You know, moved her.
Either way, it's-- it's a lead.
♪ ♪
Val, they're here!
- Just in time for dinner.
- Yeah.
- Hey, pumpkin.
- Hey, dad.
Sweetheart.
Good to see you, sweetheart.
- Nice to see you.
- How are you, baby?
- Great.
Thank you.
Dad, this is sean.
- Hi.
Sean.
Nice to meet you.
- John, nice to meet you.
Come on in.
Sean.
- Well, michael flew international forever
Till leila was, like, ten.
And then finally, he made the switch
And flew domestic.
And that's when he took the job at avlas.
- Ooh, should I check on sam?
- No, no, no.
She's fine.
It's good that she finally fell asleep.
If she doesn't get her afternoon nap,
She is so crabby.
- I'm exactly the same way so... he's not joking.
Everything tastes fantastic.
And these-- this sweet potato thing
Is delicious.
Oh, thank you so much.
- Well, sean, it must be hard on your folks
Not having you around for the holiday.
Uh, it is.
But, um, you know, they're kind of used to it.
Where do they live?
- Uh, here and there, you know.
They, um, they move around a lot.
- For work or they just like to travel?
They just...
Move around a lot.
- Where are they spending thanksgiving?
uh, you know, um...
To tell the truth, I
- I...
Haven't really spoken to them in-- in a while.
My-- my parents split when I was a kid.
And my mom, she-- she wasn't, uh, well.
So, uh, my dad got full custody.
But then after the separation, he just kind of fell apart.
Started, uh, drinking and...
Anyway, I just was glad to be out of there
After high school.
I haven't really, um, spoken to them since.
And, yeah.
And I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to lie earlier.
I just felt weird, uh, telling you guys that stuff.
That's my story in a nutshell.
Room service.
Get the okay on the girl yet?
- Any minute.
Just talked to lonner.
Apparently walker disabled the gps on the car.
And he figured out a way to jam his cell phone
So we won't be able to track him with that either.
- Told you walker wouldn't make it easy
To find him.
He's smart.
There. 255.
Yellow house.
- Okay, drive past it and pull over here.
Curtains were closed.
I can't see what's going on inside.
- Well, there's only one way to find out.
Hello.
Got it.
Understood.
Good to go on the girl.
- Finally.
- No, no, no.
I'll do it.
- Oh.
That's what I figured.
Meaning?
- Meaning you got something personal with her, don't you?
No.
It's never personal.
I just like to finish what I start.
What?
- This is against everything I've been taught.
Going in alone.
- Well, we have no choice.
We know that they're monitoring the fbi
And probably the local police.
- Okay, you understand that we don't know
How many people might be in there, right?
- I know.
Which is why I think you should give me a gun.
Without training,
You're more dangerous with a gun than not.
So just stay behind me
And keep those eyes open, all right?
- We're gonna need another car.
See what you can dig up.
- Fbi.
Are you alone in the house?
- We have a $67 billion intelligence budget
And we still can't trace a damn phone call?
These people got close enough to my son
To put a phone in his bag!
- We're looking into the possibility
It was done while david was in school
When the bag may have been left unattended.
- Which it shouldn't have been.
I want everyone on my son's secret service detail replaced.
I want security around him and christina
Increased immediately, understood?
I don't care how you do it,
But you're gonna find the man who made that call.
Yes, sir.
- I want you to know every single agency
Under my purview is doing everything it can
To protect your family.
- All right.
We need to focus on the larger threat.
He said "people will die."
- Well, we've upped the threat level to orange,
Doubled air surveillance
And security at international checkpoints.
We are as ready for his next move as possible.
- They can transport an airliner 2,000 miles
In the blink of an eye.
We have no idea what else they can do.
- But we know they have some limits.
For instance, they can't transport sophia
And the detainees out of our custody
Or they would have done so by now.
- Any idea as to why they can't?
- Until we get real intelligence,
It's all just guesswork.
Unless we get sophia to talk.
- I don't know what to talk about
With this...
Person.
Is that what we call her?
A person?
- you're nervous.
- I know.
Why?
- I love it.
- I mean, I'm good at this.
Right?
I can talk to anyone.
Babe, it's a meet and greet.
Bread and wine and some kind of tofu thing.
It'll be over before we know it.
- Oh, no.
She's a vegetarian?
- Vegan, apparently.
- Oh, forget it.
We have absolutely nothing in common.
- Come here.
Where are you going?
This way.
Come on.
Oh, thank you.
It's all so delicious.
- That's because I had nothing to do with it.
- Ha.
I managed to marry a cuban girl who doesn't cook.
So how did you two meet?
- Ah.
- Our mothers set us up.
- Ah.
They came over together from cuba
As teenagers on the same fishing boat.
Yes.
- My mom was pregnant and very alone.
And christina's mom took care of her
During the trip.
- Then they lost touch when they got to miami.
But then 30 years lar,
They're standing in line for bocaditos
At la rosa bakery and, uh...
And here we are.
Amazing.
A refugee comes to this country pregnant,
Poor, alone, and a generation later,
Her son is the president.
This is why your country is truly great.
- I couldn't agree more.
- Mm-hmm.
- So you understand why I'm hopeful
That you will welcome my people the way that this country
Lcomed yours.
My dream is that one day my people
Will sit around a table like this
And tell their immigration stories
And it will seem no more strange
Than a tale of a fishing boat from cuba.
- I-I am sorry-
- I'm sorry that it's come to this.
- If you were so sorry, you would start talking.
Who made that call, sophia, and how do I stop them?
- You know that I can't-- - no, no, no.
It's not that you can't.
You won't.
You do exactly what you want, no matter the consequences.
Isn't that right?
- You-- - isn't that right?
- The plane.
The passengers.
It's all you.
You're pulling the strings.
- You're wrong.
I didn't condone any of this.
- You had one of your own killed because he was going to talk.
What?
Did you think I'd never figure that out?
Sophia...
You call yourself my friend.
If there's anything true to that,
If there's anything that's real that's left,
Please...
Tell me what you know.
His name is thomas.
He is intelligent,
Charismatic.
A natural leader.
But we've always had different ideas
About how to adapt to our presence here.
He is less patient.
Impulsive.
- Where is he now?
I don't know.
But whatever he's asking you for,
Give it to him.
Well, what he wants...
Is you and the detainees.
That's not going to happen.
Listen to me, elias,
I know him better than anyone.
You need to give him what he wants.
- Or what?
- I don't know.
But please, for the safety of your people,
Do what he says.
- Suki, I want you to go to ward one.
Jake, go to ward three, please.
I'm positive.
I've never seen her before in my life.
- then why is she, uh, paying for you
To live here?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
Well--
- Now, I have seen your credentials, agent collier.
But I don't believe I've ever seen yours.
Who are you?
- Agent walker.
- Agent walker must've left his badge in the car again.
Can we talk for a sec?
- What are you doing?
Lower the hammer on her.
She's obviously lying.
- And so are we.
If she figures out we're not here
On official fbi business,
She's gonna stop talking.
So what do we do?
- All right, just wait outside.
Let me handle this.
Sorry about that.
- I told you I don't know this person.
Okay, I understand.
So how is she paying your rent?
- She's not paying my rent.
I don't know her.
Here is the document that agent walker
Was referring to.
If you look, it clearly states that a laura roderick paid
Last month's rent.
- Well, uh, there must be some kind of a mistake.
Hey.
Is this yours?
What's your name?
- Adam.
- Hi, adam.
My name is sean.
- Are you a friend of my mommy's?
Um, yeah.
Yeah, I am.
I have a picture of us, actually.
That's your mommy, right?
You're lucky.
Grandma says we can't keep real pictures of her.
Are you going to see her soon?
- I don't know.
I hope so.
- Can you take a picture of me?
Show her how big I got?
Sure.
Yeah.
Ready?
Smile.
Got a good one.
- Can I see?
Sure.
all right.
I'll show that to her.
I just wanted to make sure you got your music box back.
It's nice to meet you, adam.
- Nice meeting you.
- Good-bye.
- I'm sorry I couldn't help you.
- Okay, what you're doing is aiding and abetting a felon.
That could land you in jail.
- Please go.
- I know why you won't talk.
You're vicky's mother.
And you're trying to protect her along with your grandson adam.
He's fine.
He's playing in his bedroom.
- Where's your daughter, mrs.
Larson?
- Please, no one's supposed to know--
Then stop playing games.
Or child protective services can determine whose custody
He should be in.
- I don't know where my daughter is.
She just contacts me every few months
To check up on adam.
- Well, you must have some way to reach her.
- I'm only supposed to call this in an emergency.
Please.
Don't do this.
Look, I know that this isn't your choice.
I know that somebody else is telling you to do this.
You don't have to listen to them.
Actually, I do.
- I-I don't even know who you are.
You can let me go.
- Stop talking.
Now turn around.
Turn around.
Oh!
Police!
Stop!
Stay right there.
Please help me!
Please help me.
He's after me.
Who-- who is after you?
- He's after me, he's coming-- - who's coming?
- I was kidnapped, and I-- and I just shot somebody.
You shot somebody.
You were kidnapped, and you shot somebody.
I shot somebody just now.
- All right, fine.
Just calm down.
- Calm down?
Are you listening to what I'm saying?
- I am trying to listen to you,
But you're not making sense.
- I need to go with you.
Please, just take me with you!
All right.
Dispatch, this is unit 7.
Coming home with a possible 10-96.
Over.
Male dispatcher:
Copy that, unit 7.
- She says she was kidnapped.
And she shot one of her captors in self-defense.
- Any reports of shots being fired?
Nope.
What do you think?
I'm not sure.
But that's what she believes.
- Well, I can get a psych consult in here,
But not till tomorrow morning.
She got anywhere to go?
- There is one person she wants to call.
Let her.
And see if she can give you a description
Of these captors.
Here ya go.
720 area code.
That's, uh, colorado.
My ex-husband did a stint in denver.
- None of vicky's previous aliases
Had addresses in colorado, right?
This could be a new one.
She could be there.
- Hi, this is sean.
Leave a message.
Sean?
Sean, it's me.
I'm-
- I'm okay.
I'm safe.
I'm-
- I'm in this police station.
In, uh, in this-- in this town.
Snyder.
In texas.
And, um...
I got away.
I got away, and I--
I don't think that the police believe me.
And what happened.
Any of it.
Sean, please come and get me.
Please come and get me, okay?
I love you.
- Mom, weren't you gonna show me that thing?
Right, yeah, the thing.
- What, so, what's the verdict?
Do you think dad likes him?
- I don't know, but he has got my seal of approval.
I think you picked a really good one, honey.
I'm so happy for you.
Baby.
- I've got something I think you're gonna like.
Listen, I didn't mean to put you on the spot earlier.
I just like to know who my daughter's dating.
Oh...
It's fine.
Leila really likes you.
And you seem like a decent guy.
You are a decent guy, right?
Uh, I-
- I like to think so.
- Good, well, make my daughter happy,
Treat her with respect...
And that is all I ask.
Scotch.
Now, that is a serious drink.
Sean...
Try this.
Very rare stuff.
Gift from a friend.
Hmm.
You ready?
Yes, I am.
Welcome to the family.
well...
Thanks.
Hey, miss.
Can I get you some water or tea?
I might have some tea back there.
Just have some water.
Thanks.
Sure.
I'll just be a minute.
She made the call, but walker didn't pick up.
But she left a message.
You're gonna be fine.
Ugh!
- You'll go on with your life.
Raise a bunch of babies.
Whatever.
- Well, let's just hope walker gets the message.
Otherwise, I'm not sure how we're gonna find him.
He'll get it.
And when he does, trust me, he'll come.
Dempsey:
I hope you're calling with good news.
It worked.
She called sean and left him a message.
As soon as he gets it, he'll be on his way.
- When he gets there, take care of him.
This time for good.
Yes, sir.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
Duck!
(SIGHS)
COLLIER:
I don't see anyone, but that doesn't mean anything.
COLLIER:
Just drive.
SEAN:
Where?
COLLIER:
Just anywhere away from here.
The boyfriend got away.
VICKY:
I spent time with Walker.
He shouldn't have been a problem for you and Smith.
Yeah?
Well, he was.
Based on what we think he told the FBI, it's clear he's starting to put all this together.
You better move the girl.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(GASPS)
What are you doing?
This is their car.
The shooters.
Maybe there's something that will tell us who they are.
Damn it!
Nothing.
Well, at Ieast now you believe me.
I haven't gotten that far.
What's this guy doing?
What?
SEAN:
You see this guy?
You see how fast he's going?
Yeah, yeah.
I see him.
It's him.
Go.
Go faster.
Just go faster.
What?
COLLIER:
Okay, he's gaining.
Just floor it.
I am.
(GUN FIRING)
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him!
I can't.
I can't.
Not at this distance.
Well, so what do we do?
(GUN FIRING)
Okay, just hit the brake hard.
Did you say "brake"?
Yes.
Then cut the wheel to the Ieft.
Just trust me.
Okay.
Now!
Go!
Are you sure?
Go.
AII right.
Got it!
AII right.
I disconnected the car's GPS, so they can't track us.
Well, not using that anyway.
I worked with those men for four years.
Day and night.
I want the people who did this.
I want them to pay.
You're going to tell me everything you know, you understand?
That's what I've been trying to do.
So, tell me.
How do I find these bastards?
Well...
Yeah.
Through her.
The woman who's holding Leila.
COLLIER:
Vicky Roberts.
Or whatever her real name is.
These are all the aliases that I pulled up.
We just have to hope that she's still using at Ieast one of them.
AII right.
I'II make some phone calls.
No, you can't.
You can't.
You saw what happened when you called someone about me.
No, there's people I can trust.
My ex-husband works at Justice.
You know his Social and date of birth?
Yeah.
Then I can get you into that database.
Look, you've been lucky, okay, but you have no training.
You're just not capable...
I was capable enough to save your life.
Twice.
Listen, Leila is out there somewhere, and she's waiting for me, and I'm not going to let her down.
(CD SKIPPING)
Are you ready?
Yeah!
Sean?
Yes.
Come with me.
Come with you?
I can't afford a plane ticket.
And I'm not gonna let you get me one either.
We'II drive.
Do you know how long that will take?
16 hours.
Okay.
We'II get there just in time for Thanksgiving dinner.
Um...
Wow!
What?
Is it me?
No, no, no.
No.
God, no!
You're perfect.
Then what?
(LAUGHING)
Okay.
Really?
Yeah.
Let's do it.
AII right.
Okay.
Thanksgiving dinner.
(CD SKIPPING)
Would you do the honors?
Thank you very much.
(LAUGHS) Lovely radio.
CARTER:
Step!
Step!
Three more.
(GRUNTS)
Beer's for me.
Can we just get this done already?
Unfortunately, the toilet's broken.
So you're gonna need to use this.
Damn it!
Don't worry, Leila.
You're gonna be fine.
If you behave yourself, nothing's gonna happen to you.
We'II let you go, you'II go on with your life, raise a bunch of babies, whatever,
and you'II forget all about this.
Do you believe me?
Nod your head so I know you believe me.
Good.
I'm glad we had this little chat.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Oh, come on.
Are you really drinking again?
CARTER:
I broke my last one.
VICKY:
Yeah?
So?
Then don't leave it on the floor.
Besides, you shouldn't be drinking anyway.
Look, you need to be alert.
Why?
We're just waiting for the word.
She'II be dead in two hours.
(PANTING GASPS)
I noticed something wasn't right.
The seatbelt light was on, but a passenger got up anyway.
Where am I?
I'm hungry.
I haven't had anything to eat.
I was going to Brazil and...
The last thing I remember is taking off from Miami International.
I don't know what happened.
I've been trying to figure out what happened.
Why don't you tell me what happened?
I remember shutting my eyes, willing myself to get there, and then I opened them, and I'm here.
I want my mommy.
I work for the damn government.
I expect you to tell me what the hell is going on in here.
Nobody will even tell me where I am, okay?
Does that seem normal to you?
Nothing has been made clear.
(SOBBING) Why can't I remember anything about it?
ELIAS:
I don't understand this.
I saw these people.
They were dead.
We ran high frequency PET scans on the passengers, for the autopsies.
And now, having gotten the results, we can see there was some evidence of mitochondrial activity.
Are you saying they were still alive and you didn't know?
I'm saying their vital signs were sub-viable.
There was no heartbeat, no pulse, no brain activity.
But something, some process was still going on in their bodies.
Meaning?
At this point, sir, I would just be guessing.
We simply don't know what was done to them.
And they can't tell us.
AII the passengers remember is their takeoff from Miami.
Okay.
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you, sir.
Why?
Why do this?
Seemingly kill these people, only to bring them back to us?
Maybe it's a display of power.
Them showing us what they can do.
To what end?
Excuse me a moment, sir.
What is it?
Mr. Vice President, the pilot, Michael Buchanan, he's awake.
Good, I want to talk to him.
There's a problem.
Director Sterling is already in with him.
Buchanan may hold the key to who was behind the plot to kill the President.
Sterling's the Iast person we want him talking to about it.
Mr. Buchanan, we already know you got on that plane intending to kill the President.
They killed my wife, they took my daughters.
They were going to murder Leila in front of me.
Okay.
Okay, you do whatever you want to me.
But please, just tell me my daughters are okay.
Your daughters haven't been located yet, Mr. Buchanan.
But I'II see what I can do to help.
BLAKE:
In return,
I need you to tell me about the people behind this.
Who was forcing you to fly that plane into the presidential compound?
MICHAEL:
I don't know who they are.
I don't even know what happened.
Focus on the people who did this.
On what you know about them.
A name, a conversation you overheard.
BLAKE:
Please, Mr. Buchanan.
We need to find them.
(SIGHS)
Leila knew the girl who was going to kill her.
Her name was Vicky.
That's all I know.
We'II talk again, Mr. Buchanan.
How long have you been standing there?
Long enough to know you've been keeping information from me.
Why wasn't I told you were interviewing the pilot?
As we discussed, you're not running the investigation into the assassination attempt.
I am.
And you know how I feel about that.
Oh, yes.
I remember your insinuation quite clearly.
And I chose not to be offended by it.
That's all you have to say?
The President and I have our differences, but the idea of me having anything to do with trying to kill him is absurd.
If only because that would put you in charge.
There was this little girl.
She couldn't have been much older than David.
I saw her at the crash site, Iying there, her skin grey.
She was dead.
And then today, there she was.
She was standing there right in front of me.
It's like a miracle.
It's not a miracle.
It's not a miracle.
It's something else that Sophia's people can do that we just don't understand.
Honey, it's natural for you to question this.
You feel betrayed.
But as scary as the past few days have been, everyone has come out of it alive.
Things could be a Iot worse.
Is that yours?
No.
I don't think so.
Hello?
David?
David!
David.
Dad, it's for you.
Who is this?
I'm the man who pulled the plane out of the sky to save your life.
(WHISPERING) Secret Service.
Then I guess I should thank you.
But you know you caused quite a scare with what you did with those passengers.
That was by design.
I see.
Maybe you and I should sit down and talk face-to-face.
Just you and me.
No.
There's been enough talk.
What do you want?
Release Sophia and the rest of the detainees like you promised to.
That promise was based on the premise that we were both being honest with each other.
Mr. President,
I don't need to hear your excuses.
Release Sophia and the detainees, or this time people will die.
Hold on, hold on.
Wi-Fi.
Pull over.
Pull over.
I found an unsecured node.
SEAN:
It's amazing how many people still don't password-protect their Wi-Fi.
clearly they have no idea what lurks out there.
(EXHALES)
Okay.
We're in.
I used your ex's info to backdoor the password recovery system.
So, what now?
Okay.
Look for bank accounts or credit cards for any of the identities she's been using.
Then see if there's been any recent activity.
Okay.
SEAN:
Search protocol is pretty self-explanatory.
So, this is how you make a living?
Well, I freelance.
You know, writing code and making video games.
Well, here we go.
One ofVicky's aliases, Laura Roderick, just paid rent on a house last week in Lubbock, Texas.
SEAN:
And she used a credit card in that name to buy groceries in the same area.
So, she's there now.
But do you think Leila could be there?
Last time anyone saw her, she was in Miami.
There's someone out there that you're making very nervous, so, it makes sense that maybe they would have moved her.
Either way, it's a lead.
Val, they're here!
Just in time for dinner.
Yeah.
Hey, pumpkin!
Hey, Dad.
Good to see you, sweetheart.
Nice to see you.
How are you, baby?
Great.
Thank you.
Dad, this is Sean.
Hi!
Sean.
Nice to meet you.
Sean, nice to meet you.
Come on in.
Michael flew international forever until Leila was like 10.
And then he made the switch, and he flew domestic, and that's when he took the job at Avias.
Should I check on Sam?
No, no, no.
She's fine.
It's good that she finally fell asleep.
If she doesn't get her afternoon nap, she is so crabby.
I'm exactly the same way.
(LAUGHS)
He's not joking.
Everything tastes fantastic.
And this sweet potato thing is delicious.
Thank you so much.
Well, Sean, it must be hard on your folks not having you around for the holiday.
Uh, it is, but, you know, they're kind of used to it.
Where do they live?
Here and there.
You know.
They move around a Iot.
For work, or do they just like to travel?
They just move around a Iot.
Where are they spending Thanksgiving?
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
(STUTTERING) You know...
To tell the truth, I haven't really spoken to them in a while.
My parents split when I was a kid.
My mom, she wasn't well, so my dad got full custody, but then after the separation, he just kind of fell apart, and started drinking and...
Anyway, I just was glad to be out of there after high school.
And I haven't really spoken to him since.
And, yeah.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to lie earlier.
I just felt weird telling you guys that stuff.
That's my story in a nutshell.
(PANTING GASPS)
(EFFORT GRUNTING)
Room service.
You get the okay on the girl yet?
Any minute.
I just talked to Lonner.
Apparently, Walker disabled the GPS on the car, and he figured out a way to jam his cell phone, so we won't be able to track him with that either.
I told you Walker wouldn't make it easy to find him.
He's smart.
There, 255, yellow house.
Okay.
Drive past it and pull over here.
The curtains were closed.
I can't see what's going on inside.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
Come on.
(PHONE RINGING)
VICKY:
Hello?
VICKY:
Got it.
Understood.
We're good to go on the girl.
Finally.
No, no, no.
I'II do it.
Oh!
That's what I figured.
Meaning?
Meaning you've got something personal with her, don't you?
No.
It's never personal.
I just like to finish what I start.
(GASPING)
(WHIMPERS)
What?
This is against everything I've been taught.
Going in alone.
Well, we have no choice.
We know that they're monitoring the FBI and probably the local police.
Okay, you understand that we don't know how many people might be in there, right?
I know.
Which is why I think you should give me a gun.
Without training, you're more dangerous with a gun than not.
So, just stay behind me and keep those eyes open, all right?
(SCOFFS)
(GRUNTS)
We're going to need another car.
See what you can dig up.
FBI.
Are you alone in the house?
Yes.
MRS. LARSON:
Can I help you?
We have a $67 billion intelligence budget and we still can't trace a damn phone call?
These people got close enough to my son to put a phone in his bag.
We're looking into the possibility it was done while David was in school, when the bag may have been left unattended.
Which it shouldn't have been.
I want everyone on my son's Secret Service detail replaced.
I want security around him and Christina increased immediately.
Understood?
I don't care how you do it.
But you are gonna find the man who made that call.
Yes, sir.
I want you to know, every single agency under my purview is doing everything they can to protect your family.
AII right.
We need to focus on the larger threat.
He said people will die.
We've upped the threat level to orange, doubled air surveillance and security at international checkpoints.
We are as ready for his next move as possible.
They can transport an airliner 2,000 miles in the blink of an eye.
We have no idea what else they can do.
But we know they have some limits.
For instance, they can't transport Sophia and the detainees out of our custody or they would have done so by now.
Any idea as to why they can't?
Until we get real intelligence, it's all just guesswork.
Unless we get Sophia to talk.
I don't know what to talk about with this person.
Is that what we call her?
A person?
(LAUGHS) You're nervous.
I know.
Why?
I Iove it.
I mean, I'm good at this, right?
I can talk to anyone.
Babe, it's a meet and greet.
Bread and wine and some kind of tofu thing.
It'II be over before we know it.
Oh, no.
She's a vegetarian?
Vegan, apparently.
Forget it.
We have absolutely nothing in common.
Come here.
Where are you going?
This way.
Come on.
Ma'am.
Thank you.
It's all so delicious.
That's because I had nothing to do with it.
I managed to marry a Cuban girl who doesn't cook.
So, how did you two meet?
Our mothers set us up.
Yeah!
They came over together from Cuba as teenagers on the same fishing boat.
Yes.
My mom was pregnant and very alone.
And Christina's mom took care of her during the trip.
Then they lost touch when they got to Miami, but then 30 years later, they are standing in line for bocaditos at La Rosa Bakery and...
And here we are.
(LAUGHS)
That's amazing.
A refugee comes to this country, pregnant, poor, alone.
A generation later, her son is the president.
This is why your country is truly great.
I couldn't agree more.
So, you understand why I'm hopeful that you will welcome my people the way that this country welcomed yours.
My dream is that one day my people will sit around a table like this and tell their immigration stories.
And it will seem no more strange than a tale of a fishing boat from Cuba.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that it's come to this.
If you were so sorry you would start talking.
Who made that call, Sophia?
And how do I stop him?
You know that I can't...
No, no, no.
It's not that you can't.
You won't.
You do exactly what you want, no matter the consequences.
Isn't that right?
Isn't that right?
No.
The plane, the passengers.
It's all you.
You're pulling the strings.
You're wrong.
I didn't condone any of this.
You had one of your own killed because he was going to talk.
What?
Did you think I'd never figure that out?
Sophia...
You call yourself my friend.
If there's anything true to that, if there's anything that's real, that's left, please.
Tell me what you know.
His name is Thomas.
He is intelligent.
Charismatic.
A natural leader.
But we've always had different ideas about how to adapt to our presence here.
He is less patient.
Impulsive.
Where is he now?
I don't know.
But whatever he's asking you for, give it to him.
Well, what he wants is you and the detainees.
That's not going to happen.
Listen to me, EIias.
I know him better than anyone.
You need to give him what he wants.
Or what?
I don't know.
But please, for the safety of your people, do what he says.
DOCTOR PULRAY:
Suki, I want you to go to Ward One.
SUKI:
Right away.
DOCTOR PULRAY:
Jake, go to Ward Three, please.
JAKE:
Yes, Doctor Pulray.
(COUGHING)
I'm positive.
I've never seen her before in my Iife.
Then why is she paying for you to live here?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well...
I have seen your credentials, Agent Collier, but I don't believe I've ever seen yours.
Who are you?
Agent Walker.
Agent Walker must have left his badge in the car again.
Can we talk for a second?
What are you doing?
Lower the hammer on her.
She's obviously lying.
So are we.
If she figures out we're not here on official
FBI business, she's gonna stop talking.
So what do we do?
AII right.
Just wait outside.
Let me handle this.
COLLIER:
Sorry about that.
MRS. LARSON:
I told you.
I don't know this person.
Okay, I understand.
So, how is she paying your rent?
She's not paying my rent.
I don't know her.
We're subletting this.
Here is the document that Agent Walker was referring to.
If you look, it clearly states that a Laura Roderick paid last month's rent.
There must be some kind of a mistake.
Hey.
Is this yours?
What's your name?
Adam.
Hi, Adam.
My name is Sean.
Are you a friend of my mommy's?
Yeah.
Yeah, I am.
I have a picture of us actually.
That's your mommy, right?
You're lucky.
Grandma says we can't keep real pictures of her.
Are you going to see her soon?
I don't know.
I hope so.
Can you take a picture of me?
Show her how big I got?
Sure.
Yeah.
Ready?
Smile.
It's a good one.
Can I see?
Sure.
AII right.
I'II show that to her.
I just wanted to make sure you got your music box back.
Nice to meet you, Adam.
Nice meeting you.
Bye.
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.
Okay, what you're doing is aiding and abetting a felon.
That could land you in jail.
please go.
SEAN:
I know why you won't talk.
You're Vicky's mother.
And you're trying to protect her, along with your grandson, Adam.
He's fine.
He's playing in his bedroom.
Where is your daughter, Mrs. Larson?
please, no one's supposed to know.
Then stop playing games, or Child Protective Services can determine whose custody he should be in.
I don't know where my daughter is.
She just contacts me every few months to check up on Adam.
Well, you must have some way to reach her.
I'm only supposed to call this in an emergency.
please.
Don't do this.
Look, I know that this isn't your choice.
I know that somebody else is telling you to do this.
You don't have to listen to them.
Actually, I do.
I don't even know who you are.
You can let me go.
Stop talking.
Now turn around.
Turn around.
(GRUNTING)
(GUN FIRING)
(PANTING)
Hey!
Hey!
Stop!
Stay right there.
please help me.
please help me.
AII right.
He's after me right now.
please.
Who is after you?
He's after me.
He's coming...
Who's coming?
I was kidnapped and I just shot somebody.
You shot somebody.
You were kidnapped, and you shot somebody?
I shot somebody just now.
You know what?
AII right.
Fine.
Just calm down.
Calm down?
Calm down?
Are you listening to what I'm saying?
He's after me right now.
I'm trying to listen to you, but you're not making sense.
No.
I need to go.
I need to go with you.
please just take me with you.
AII right.
Dispatch, this is Unit Seven coming home with a possible 10-96.
Over.
DISPATCHER:
Copy that, Unit Seven.
OFFICER HOLT:
She said she's kidnapped, and she shot one of her captors in self-defense.
Any reports of shots being fired?
Nope.
What do you think?
I'm not sure.
But that's what she believes.
I can get a psych consult in here, but not until tomorrow morning.
She got anywhere to go?
There is one person she wants to call.
Let her.
Then see if she can give you a description of these captors.
Here you go.
720 area code, that's Colorado.
My ex-husband did a stint in Denver.
None ofVicky's previous aliases had addresses in Colorado, right?
This could be a new one.
She could be there.
(DIALING PHONE NUMBER)
(PHONE BUZZING)
(CAR STARTING)
Hi, this is Sean.
Leave a message.
Sean?
Sean, it's me.
I'm okay.
I'm safe.
I'm in this police station.
In this town, Snyder.
In Texas.
And...
I got away.
I got away and...
I don't think that the police believe me or what happened, any of it.
Sean, please come and get me!
please come and get me, okay?
I Iove you.
(CRYING)
LEILA:
Mom, weren't you going to show me that thing?
Right.
The thing.
So?
What's the verdict?
You think Dad likes him?
(LAUGHING)
I don't know, but he has got my seal of approval.
I think you picked a really good one, honey.
I'm so happy for you.
I've got something I think you're gonna like.
Listen, I didn't mean to put you on the spot earlier.
I just like to know who my daughter's dating.
Oh, it's fine.
Leila really likes you, and you seem like a decent guy.
You are a decent guy, right?
(STUTTERING) I'd Iike to think so.
Good.
Well, make my daughter happy, treat her with respect, and that is all I ask.
Scotch!
Now, that is a serious drink.
Sean, try this.
Very rare stuff.
Gift from a friend.
Ready?
Yes, I am.
Welcome to the family.
Well, thanks.
Hey, miss.
Can I get you some water or tea?
We might have some tea back there.
I'II just have some water.
Thanks.
Sure.
Just be a minute.
She made the call.
But Walker didn't pick up.
But she left a message?
(GRUNTS)
You're gonna be fine.
You'II go on with your life, raise a bunch of babies, whatever.
(BANGING ON DOOR)
(GUN FIRING)
Let's just hope Walker gets the message.
Otherwise I'm not sure how we're gonna find him.
He'II get it.
And when he does, trust me, he'II come.
DEMPSEY:
I hope you're calling with good news.
It worked.
She called Sean, left him a message.
As soon as he gets it, he'II be on his way.
When he gets there, take care of him.
This time for good.
Yes, sir.
PYRENEES, 1892
This way, gentlemen.
Gentlemen, I won't keep you waiting any longer.
As you know, Holbein lndustries have manufactured the best weapons for many years now.
But to truly revolutionize our industry...
Gentlemen, I give you...
Artur Prats.
I'm a man of few words.
So I'll keep this short.
Above all, I'd like you to see for yourselves what we've got here to show you today.
Please, come and look through the telescopes.
Tell me, how many balloons can you see?
I see two.
These are the best telescopes on the market.
We already know these models.
I know.
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
I'm sorry, Daddy.
Forgive me.
I'm not your dad.
Joana, I'm here now.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Oh, God.
Are you okay?
Daddy?
Look at me, look at me, darling!
Joana, look at me.
Extra, extra!
Another anarchist bomb attack!
Seven murdered and fifteen injured in Almirall street!
Stay still!
No, not his face!
Just calm down.
What happened?
I was fired.
Why?
It's complicated.
Then start at the beginning.
1 1 DAYS earlier
The day begins at half past five in the morning.
At five on Tuesdays, and at four o'clock if you have to go to market.
You'll have to make sure all the doors and windows are shut tight before night falls.
From that moment on, no one is allowed on Madam's floor.
Any problem with that?
None at all.
Close up everything before dark and ask before going upstairs.
Piece of cake.
Hold on.
Let me do it.
This is where Ma'am sits.
What's that for?
To tell them apart.
It seems she can distinguish colours.
That's why we all wear rosettes.
You see?
Marga, that's not exactly true.
We get branded here like cattle because of that freak of nature.
Mariano, cut that out!
Take that back this instant.
Mariano... lt's Mr. Lardin.
He was meant to be back tomorrow.
He's decided to come back early.
Get to your positions.
Set another place, Margarita.
Carles is hungry!
Thank you.
Who is this Carles?
Carles Lardin, Madam's fiance.
I'm going back to Madrid before the end of the month.
If you agree, we can close the deal.
-Fine.
-lt's the answerto our prayers.
That's great.
But let's leave business until tomorrow.
Your return couldn't be more timely.
How come?
I'd ratherthe Doctortold us.
Meissner has returned?
Not exactly.
What?
is he still here?
I won't be for much longer, I assure you.
Excuse me, Doctor, I didn't mean to...
Don't worry, Carles.
What he means is that...
Well, you explain it.
My pleasure.
I'm very pleased to be here this evening to announce that, after having studied Joana's case exhaustively, I can finally give you a diagnosis.
Really?
Are you completely sure?
Please.
The hypnosis sessions with Joana couldn't have been more revealing.
Hypnosis?
Allow me to explain.
We knew Joana had problems recognising sounds, objects and also people, but we didn't understand why.
Well, now I am quite sure.
Imagine that this jug contains all the stimuli reality offers us.
Images, sounds, smells, etc.
Now when you look at this glass, think of it as a brain, young, healthy and pure.
From the day we're born to the day we die,
this is all we actually perceive of reality.
Thanks to this filter, we can separate out that extra information which would otherwise submerge our minds in chaos.
Unfortunately, this is not the case for Joana.
The encephalitis she had as a child destroyed that filter.
Since then, an excess of information has been reaching Joana's brain.
Her brain can't process it or remember... I am sorry.
Don't worry.
What are you driving at with all of this?
The sound proofing of her bedroom is almost ready, but I fear it isn't enough.
We need to seal the room completely.
No inside or outside light.
What?
You want to put her in a cage?
No. "Cocoon"
would be a more fitting description.
We'll finish this conversation later.
Joana.
I don't feel very comfortable in this dress.
But you look beautiful.
It's one of her mother's dresses.
Look.
Look who's here.
Come on, Joana.
Who is it?
It's Carles.
Carles...
-Come on, say something to her.
-Daddy.
Doesn't she look pretty?
Radiant.
You'll see what a knock-out she looks in a wedding dress.
It's impossible to get near her.
That doctor is always there.
You won't find anything in that house.
Are you sure?
Fine. ln that case...
Let's go.
Right.
We'll be in touch with you just as soon as we have a signed statement.
That wretch will nevertalk.
He doesn't know who's paying him.
Sir?
What do you mean by that?
It's not the first time somebody's been snooping about yourfactory, but this time they tried to force the lock on your office door.
Let's not kid ourselves, this has nothing to do with anarchists.
I agree with you there.
If you had any idea who was behind this, you'd let me know, wouldn't you?
Now, if you'll excuse me... ls there anything I should know?
Industrial espionage?
I'm only asking if apart from manufacturing weapons, you've also started your own line in lenses?
You know I've always been a very open-minded business woman.
I thought your determination would have waned after so many years.
Your military friends are very keen for you to make them a telescopic rifle, but one thing is selling something you still haven't manufactured and quite another is speculating with "borrowed" technology.
I hope you haven't come here just to insult me.
Just accept it!
I never manufactured the catadioptric lens.
You can look under every last stone on earth, but you won't find a thing.
I burnt it all.
So, as far as Joana Lenses is concerned, you can say goodbye to yourtelescopic rifle.
That's a pity.
We were hoping to invest in Joana Lenses.
I appreciate your generosity,
but we don't need your money.
Doesn't your pet have anything to say?
-Goodbye, Lucille.
-l'm not finished.
We've known each otherfor years, I was hoping you'd invite me to your beautiful daughter's big day.
By the way, how is she?
My God, Lucille.
Don't you have any limits?
All right.
Now I'm going to ask you a question.
And I want you to tell me the truth.
During yourwork at the mansion as a servant, did you ever come into direct contact with Artur Prats' daughter?
Carles?
is that you?
No, Ma'am.
It's me,
Vicent.
One of the servants.
See?
Oh, hello.
I was on my way to my room but I strayed off the path and now I need somebody to get me back to my route.
I see.
Where do you need to...?
If you can just wait a minute.
Whenever you're ready, Ma'am.
Can I ask you a question?
Go ahead.
Why did you stray from your route?
So I could see the stars.
They've started covering up my bedroom windows, and from time to time I need to look outside this "castle".
The night sky is one of the few things I can see just like everybody else.
Come here, take a look.
I'm sure if I pointed out all I can see up there, you'd be more lost than me.
For sure.
Truth be told, I'm also a bit lost down here.
That sounded sad.
I never know for sure when somebody is cheerful or angry or sad.
But I do have one trick.
Their breathing.
Breathing?
The way people breathe never lies.
Can you help me get back?
-Where to?
-To the handrail.
Of course.
Mind the step, Ma'am.
Thank you, Vicent.
Good night.
Good night, Ma'am.
And don't be sad.
One... two... and three.
Still dressed?
Yes, I know, I was miles away.
Sorry.
-l'll walk you there.
-No.
I can make it to the bath on my own.
Watch.
I'm sorry, Ma'am.
The Doctor didn't...
But it's right here by my side.
Really?
Yes.
Watch.
See?
Careful.
-Mariano, in the cornerwith it.
-Quickly.
-Vicent!
-Coming.
Can you help me with this?
is the watertoo cold, Ma'am?
No, it's hot.
Could you bring me some lukewarm water?
I'd have to go downstairs forthat, and you know I can't leave you in the bath on your own.
What's going to happen?
I'm not going anywhere.
Daddy!
Vincent!
Joana!
It's all right, it's me, your dad.
Call Doctor Meissner!
Now!
Stand up.
What do you want?
What do you want from me?
Carles.
Good luck.
Good night, gentlemen.
Have you got a moment?
Can we talk?
We do need to talk.
Have a seat.
Be honest.
Do you still think that Dr Meissner won't be able to cure Joana?
I don't want to appear impertinent, but I need to talk to you about our current situation, the company's situation.
Since I came back, we haven't even...
We don't need a group of investors.
There's something I can't get out my head.
You told Lucille Prevert that you'd destroyed the formula of the lens.
Was that true?
I mean, if we could still make that lens, we'd soon get through bad patch without having to resort to investors.
Orto Holbein, naturally.
Anything but Holbein, you know that.
But we can choose our customers.
Just like we always have done.
Really?
Tell me how.
By tossing a coin to decide if they're any good?
You don't realise.
What's the matter?
What are you afraid of?
Stop worrying about the business, concern yourself more with your own affairs.
What are you trying to say?
Your daughter is all I care about.
I'd do absolutely anything for her, absolutely anything.
She will get better, Carles.
She will be cured.
And she'll be a marvellous mother and a marvellous wife.
See?
There's nothing there.
How did you do that?
It's magic.
Magic, he says.
The only magic things here are my balls.
That's real magic.
He took the flowerfrom the vase.
You're a fool, you look like a fool.
All right, let's see if you get this one.
Artur, you're absolutely right, the figures just don't add up.
We have to tighten our belts.
Eitherthat... or bankruptcy.
Vicent does him better.
Oh, yes, go on, do it for us.
Artur, if you like I could go to Madrid at the end of the month to close the deal.
It would be the answer to our prayers.
Carles...
Carles... lt's so nice to feel dizzy, Carles.
I look at you but I don't see you!
Why don't you give me a kiss?
Touch me, I can't see you!
Vicent!
Get out.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Get out of here!
It should never have happened.
Not like that.
I read your report again last night for a second time.
A quite extravagant option, if you don't mind me saying so.
The hypnosis sessions haven't produced anything.
Whateverthe secret Prats entrusted to his daughter, we're not going to find it in her subconscious.
I'm afraid this is the only alternative.
You've got three days to carry out a new mission.
Nobody's going to hurt her, are they?
Half yourfee is just in front of you.
"Darling daughter, if you hearthese words, it's because I'm no longer here.
Now, as I write these words, it's hard to believe, but I think that after all these years together I've come to the conclusion that to really love somebody you have to accept that one day
we won't be here to give the best of ourselves.
That is when we must make way for someone else.
I've organised it so you'll hear my last words from the lips of Carles,
who was like a son to me.
He'll look after you and the factory just as I always have.
I love you very much, my dear.
Very much indeed.
No fatherwants his children to get sick.
But your illness has made you special, just as special as your motherwas.
I've suffered a lot for you, you know that, but I want you to know, I'd never have swapped the daughter you've been forthe daughter you might have been.
You've caused me more pain than anything, but you've also given me more happiness than I everthought I could aspire to in this life.
Your loving father."
Leave me, please.
You must cure her.
Understand?
Now more than ever.
You have to do it.
I promised Mr. Prats l wouldn't rest until I found a cure for his daughter.
And I will keep that promise.
The "Cocoon", remember?
We have to isolate her from all stimuli.
Sounds, images, tactile sensations, temperature, absolutely everything, for a period of three days.
That includes me, the servants and even you.
Any interaction with other people could ruin everything.
You mean lock her up forthree days.
I know it's tough but we can put a stop to these nervous fits.
To block out this confusing universe she is immersed in, she has to be totally isolated.
Begin the preparations immediately.
But whatever happens, we're getting married on the 6th of January.
Without any possible delay.
Without delay.
Aren't you going to eat?
Yes.
Excuse me, I was a little distracted.
I've tried on the tunic.
The doctor says I can't take it off.
I told him that in three days I'll at least have to do number ones.
He just started laughing.
And so did I.
-Are you leaving now?
-Yes.
I have to go.
I'd love to stay here with you, but it's late.
Carles, is it always going to be like this?
Of course not.
Why do you say that?
It's all right.
You go.
The doctor is convinced you will recover.
You'll see, when we are married.
You're so naughty!
Got any spare change, sir?
Do you want to take part orto watch?
Take part orwatch?
Watch.
Don't turn around.
Don't turn around.
I'm not even going to open it.
Leave it inside without making a noise.
-Are you feeling okay?
-Yes, sir.
Quick!
Call Margarita.
Joana?
Joana?
Who's that?
Doctor?
is that you?
No, Joana, it's me.
Carles.
What?
Put the light on.
You see?
Carles, is something wrong?
No, nothing.
Don't fret.
I just had to see you.
Right now?
Are you crazy?
Let me explain.
Please... I had to talk to you before the wedding and I thought that here without anybody about... I've been doing some thinking...
About us... and the factory.
What are you trying to do?
Ruin the treatment?
I know you don't believe in Doctor Meissner, but don't spoil everything, please, even if it's just for daddy.
Please, leave.
I asked you to leave.
Why did you leave the room?
What went wrong?
I don't know.
I don't know, I thought maybe she had cottoned on.
What are you talking about?
Do you think she recognised you?
No, it's not that.
It's as if she could sense I wasn't telling the truth.
-Are you getting cold feet?
-No.
Then go back inside and follow our instructions.
is everything in order, Doctor?
Yes.
The boy is going back in.
Carles, if you don't leave, I'm going to scream.
-Just for a minute.
-Carles, no.
-You're very sad.
-What do you expect?
Joana... ln all these years, I've never had the courage
to tell you... what I really feel for you.
Are you trying to say you don't want to marry me?
Marry you?
There's nothing in this world I'd rather do more.
So you've already got what you wanted, haven't you?
Yes.
I have your hand, because yourfather gave it to me.
But I'd like to have asked you for it myself.
Aren't you going to say anything?
What am I meant to say?
Nothing.
I just wanted you to know.
I won't bother you any more.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the factory.
We've got so much work still to do.
Besides, I don't want to interfere with the treatment.
-One more thing.
-Yes?
I need... I need yourfinger measurements.
If we wait any longer to orderthe rings, they won't be ready in time.
Would you mind if I came back tomorrow?
No.
Of course not.
Tomorrow.
I'll be here.
Go and find the accounts ledgers saved from the fire and send them on to me at home.
Very well.
The news got to Madrid quick enough.
-Should I go in?
-Not yet, no.
One thing is improvising to get out of a sticky situation, quite another is disobeying instructions.
When you go back in, take up the protocol again from the part about the wedding rings.
The wedding rings, yes.
Carles?
What are you doing?
It's a surprise.
-A surprise?
-Yes.
Close your eyes.
But...
-Close your eyes.
-Okay, okay.
I'm watching you.
Now?
No, just a minute.
Whenever you're ready.
It's my engagement present.
But if you don't like it, I can get you a jewel.
It's the most beautiful present I've ever been given.
They seem real.
How did you do it?
No, don't tell me.
I'd rather not know.
Joana...
What?
Forgive me.
What for?
For having been so distant all these years.
Are you all right?
is something wrong?
My recollection of you was so different.
Joana, we're not exactly children any more.
The wedding ring.
I had to take your measurements.
Yes, that's right.
What's the matter?
Nothing. I thought you were about to "ask for my hand".
Well, in a way, that's what I am doing.
Don't you see, Carles?
We're doing everything the wrong way round!
You're right.
And it's all my fault.
Don't say that.
You and your dad always did that.
Exactly, it was something between him and I.
Forgive me.
I didn't mean to upset you.
I'm sorry.
I miss him so much.
So do I, Joana.
So do I.
Anything else, sir?
No, thank you, you can go.
Teresa?
-Sir.
-Margarita.
Excuse me.
Where is Doctor Meissner?
Actually, I don't know.
He should be in his bedroom.
Doctor.
Sir.
Can I help you with anything?
What would happen if she had a problem in there?
One of her attacks?
If what's worrying you is the storm, I can assure you her isolation is absolute.
Absolutely everything has been taken care of.
It's okay.
Leave us.
Carry on eating.
I'm not hungry.
It's obvious that you don't lack confidence in yourself.
Listen, in less than twelve hours, we have to return that girl to the world she was living in.
If you carry on playing this passionate version of Carles Lardin, the original by her side might suddenly look like a cheap fake in comparison.
And neither you nor I want that to happen.
For Joana's sake.
What do you want me to do now?
Enough beating about the bush.
When you go back in, ask her directly about the formula.
And this time, keep your enthusiasm under control.
What the hell?
What is it?
-lt's the thunder.
She can hear it!
-Hear it?
Listen to me!
I don't care if she can hear it.
What concerns me is that we can't hear her.
Everything's been taken care of.
We paid you to make the cocoon soundproof, you idiot!
In the original cocoon...
not this one.
There's a panic button.
A panic button?
Don't worry.
The button is irrelevant because Joana won't be needing it.
Believe me,
that bell isn't going to ring.
Carles!
I understand you want to see her, you miss her.
All of us worry about Joana.
Me as much as anyone.
Please forgive me, I'm... I'm...
Joana!
Joana, Joana.
It's me.
Carles. I'm here.
Everything the wrong way round.
Don't pull that face, Doctor.
Does it really surprise you?
This is our last day.
We've got to do something.
Of course we're going to do something.
You can't harm her.
We made a deal.
Indeed we did, and then you came up with this ridiculous circus performance.
What happened?
How long have I been asleep?
I don't know.
You were so tired, I didn't want to wake you.
What's that?
Daddy's photograph album.
Look, that's you at Christmas mass.
And how do you know that's me?
I know this book off by heart, and you're always the one who's next to Dad.
Well, almost always.
This will be the first year without him.
But now that Dad isn't here,
I suppose you'll be the crown prince, won't you?
No, I'm just a faithful squire, who will always protect you.
My faithful squire.
I like that.
I don't want you to worry, but I need to tell you something.
It's very important.
Joana?
Get the kid out of there.
He's had too many chances already.
What?
No!
Just a minute.
I said get him out of there now.
Carles?
I can't see you, Carles.
Carles?
Joana,
Joana, I'm not...
You're scaring me.
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
Listen to me.
There's no time.
I haven't found the courage to tell you before now.
-l'm not...
-What?
We can't escape this.
-What are you talking about?
-The thing is... I'm not... lt's the business.
We're in a critical situation.
Because of the fire?
It's not just that.
We've been operating at a loss for months.
If it continues, we'll have to close Joana Lenses within the year.
But that can't be right.
Daddy never...
Your dad neverwanted you to worry.
Listen, Joana, I've been thinking about it
and I can only see one solution.
Manufacturing the catadioptric lens.
-He didn't want to.
-l wish there were anotherway, but it's our only salvation.
If we don't, we'll go bust.
Please, give me the formula.
What formula?
My dad never gave me any formula.
And all this... was because you wanted that formula?
How can you say that?
Don't you trust me?
Come here.
Come.
Sit down.
Close your eyes.
One.
Four.
Two.
Eight.
Seven.
Seven.
Nine.
Fantastic!
When I was a little girl and I went to the factory with my father, we used to pretend I was helping him in the lab.
He always wrote those numbers on the palm of my hand.
Always the same ones, always in the same order.
I don't know.
Do you think those numbers might be...?
I think so.
Joana, I'm sorry it all had to be this way.
No, Carles. I know you're only doing this to protect me.
I trust you.
Yes.
I have to get back to work.
I thought you'd gone to the jeweller already.
Yes, I did.
It's just I didn't want to give it back.
I thought you'd want to keep it until I give you the real one.
See you outside.
In a short while, my faithful squire.
The payment for your services is in your room.
Don't be long.
Doctor?
What will happen to her now?
Don't worry.
She's sleeping peacefully, and she's going to be fine, as fine as she can be.
You can't cure her, can you?
All that stuff about the treatment was lies.
Listen carefully, forthe last time.
Son of a bitch!
Look!
Overthere!
What's all this?
Sir, I...
The police were here, sir.
The police?
What did they want?
-An escaped anarchist!
-They thought he was here.
They took us into the kitchen while they searched the mansion!
That's enough.
Mr. Lardin!
There's a fellow here at the station with a very strange story.
Yes, I know, an anarchist.
What?
No, he's not an anarchist, not as far as I know.
I know this might sound strange, but he's made a statement saying he was forced to take part in a plot to kidnap Joana Prats.
What are you talking about?
That's absurd!
Yes, but you understand it's our duty to check out his story.
Hold on.
You came to my house looking for an anarchist?
No, no.
What are you talking about?
We haven't been near your house.
But, Sir, it's still not time!
Go and find Dr. Meissner!
Joana?
Thank God.
-Are you alright?
-Of course I am!
I was so looking forward to seeing you.
So, three days here on you own.
Yes, "on my own".
Doctor Meissner isn't here yet.
We'll have to wait a while.
Do you know what we could do?
No.
I see you're feeling better.
Do you notice anything different?
Everything is different.
You know what?
I think I've even got over my fear of thunder storms.
Wait a moment.
You heard the thunder?
A little. lt was very distant.
Maybe I heard it because I'm getting better.
Maybe.
Excuse me, sir.
Good morning.
I hate to interrupt... lt's okay, darling.
Go about your business.
I'll see you later.
Marga, can you bring some more butter, please?
Yes, Ma'am.
The entrance was here.
And her bed was there.
And they controlled it all from up there.
They?
That's enough.
Let's get out of here.
Come in.
Sir, I don't mean to disturb you...
-What time is it?
-lt's seven o'clock.
Madam has already had dinner.
Would you like to have some?
No.
Maybe later.
Has Doctor Meissner called?
-Shall I call the police?
-No, not forthe time being.
Thank you.
I think Marga almost saw me.
Joana!
What are you doing?
-l couldn't stand it anymore.
-What is it?
I had to see you.
Joana, the servants!
We'll be very quiet.
Be careful.
Careful.
Just take it slowly.
Joana, please, the books.
I was so scared that it was alljust a dream, these last three days.
I thought I wouldn't be able to stand being locked up, but when I saw you come in the door, I was simply dying for you to walk in.
-You really mean that?
-Yes.
Carles...
Oh, Carles...
What is it, Joana?
Who are you?
Joana, it's me, darling.
It's me.
Last night, you seemed like someone else.
Last night?
Well?
I know it isn't pleasant.
It's a load of rubbish.
However, this man seems to have a lot of information on you.
From having worked in my house.
Well, that's what he claims.
You don't give this any credibility?
Absolutely none whatsoever.
In any case, it's easy to check whether he everworked in my house.
is Joana all right?
How could you do something like that?
They didn't give me much choice.
They knew everything about you.
Everything except that damn formula.
That formula doesn't exist.
Joana gave it to me.
They wanted to torture her.
I did it to save her.
Save her?
You?
-She doesn't even know you exist.
-Ask her about that.
-What are you saying?
-You don't deserve her.
You don't respect her as a woman.
You can't give her what she wants.
One day, she'll work out that you're not the man she was with.
And by then I won't be in here.
There's no proof against me.
If you want to accuse me of something,
you'll have to let Joana explain what happened between us to the whole world.
If you go anywhere near her again, I swearto God I'll kill you!
I'll kill you.
Everything alright?
Out, out.
How could you?
How could something like this happen?
It makes my head spin.
Did you know that good-for-nothing worked in this house?
Vicent!
The servant we dismissed!
I see you remember the bastard well enough.
Carles, I swearto God that I thought it was you!
I swear.
Well, I'm afraid that's not the way it was.
Carles, wait.
I wanted it to be you with all my heart.
Mister Lardin.
Bitch.
I'm with guests.
If you have something you'd like to say to me...
You... and Meissner and that servant... have taken everything from me.
I have nothing left.
Mister Lardin, get married, sell the business, and stop worrying,
I never leave loose ends.
Happy Christmas, sir.
Mister Lardin, Mister Lardin...
Happy Christmas.
We are very sad about the loss of Mr. Prats.
Joana.
Joana!
It's you!
Stop or I'll shoot!
Joana!
No!
Joana, Joana...
Are you okay?
It's me.
is it you?
Oh, my God.
Fetch a doctor!
Somebody find a doctor!
What is it?
What do you want?
Leave me.
Joana.
Joana?
Joana.
I'm here.
-Carles?
-No.
No, Joana, it's me.
My faithful squire.

PYRENEES, 1892
This way, gentlemen.
Gentlemen,
I won't keep you waiting any longer.
As you know, Holbein Industries have manufactured the best weapons for many years now.
But to truly revolutionize our industry...
Gentlemen, I give you...
Artur Prats.
I'm a man of few words.
So I'll keep this short.
Above all, I'd like you to see for yourselves what we've got here to show you today.
Please, come and look through the telescopes.
Tell me, how many balloons can you see?
I see two.
These are the best telescopes on the market.
We already know these models.
I know.
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
I'm sorry, Daddy.
Forgive me.
I'm not your dad.
Joana, I'm here now.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Oh, God.
Are you okay?
Daddy?
Look at me, look at me, darling!
Joana, look at me.
Extra, extra!
Another anarchist bomb attack!
Seven murdered and fifteen injured in Almirall street!
Stay still!
No, not his face!
Just calm down.
What happened?
I was fired.
Why?
It's complicated.
Then start at the beginning.
11 DAYS earlier
The day begins at half past five in the morning.
At five on Tuesdays, and at four o'clock if you have to go to market.
You'll have to make sure all the doors and windows are shut tight before night falls.
From that moment on, no one is allowed on Madam's floor.
Any problem with that?
None at all.
Close up everything before dark and ask before going upstairs.
Piece of cake.
Hold on.
Let me do it.
This is where Ma'am sits.
What's that for?
To tell them apart.
It seems she can distinguish colours.
That's why we all wear rosettes.
You see?
Marga, that's not exactly true.
We get branded here like cattle because of that freak of nature.
Mariano, cut that out!
Take that back this instant.
Mariano...
It's Mr. Lardin.
He was meant to be back tomorrow.
He's decided to come back early.
Get to your positions.
Set another place, Margarita.
Carles is hungry!
Thank you.
Who is this Carles?
Carles Lardin, Madam's fiance.
I'm going back to Madrid before the end of the month.
If you agree, we can close the deal.
Fine.
It's the answerto our prayers.
That's great.
But let's leave business until tomorrow.
Your return couldn't be more timely.
How come?
I'd ratherthe Doctortold us.
Meissner has returned?
Not exactly.
What?
Is he still here?
I won't be for much longer, I assure you.
Excuse me, Doctor, I didn't mean to...
Don't worry, Carles.
What he means is that...
Well, you explain it.
My pleasure.
I'm very pleased to be here this evening to announce that, after having studied Joana's case exhaustively,
I can finally give you a diagnosis.
Really?
Are you completely sure?
Please.
The hypnosis sessions with Joana couldn't have been more revealing.
Hypnosis?
Allow me to explain.
We knew Joana had problems recognising sounds, objects and also people, but we didn't understand why.
Well, now I am quite sure.
Imagine that this jug contains all the stimuli reality offers us.
Images, sounds, smells, etc.
Now when you look at this glass, think of it as a brain, young, healthy and pure.
From the day we're born to the day we die,
this is all we actually perceive of reality.
Thanks to this filter, we can separate out that extra information which would otherwise submerge our minds in chaos.
Unfortunately, this is not the case for Joana.
The encephalitis she had as a child destroyed that filter.
Since then, an excess of information has been reaching Joana's brain.
Her brain can't process it or remember...
I am sorry.
Don't worry.
What are you driving at with all of this?
The sound proofing of her bedroom is almost ready, but I fear it isn't enough.
We need to seal the room completely.
No inside or outside light.
What?
You want to put her in a cage?
No."Cocoon"
would be a more fitting description.
We'll finish this conversation later.
Joana.
I don't feel very comfortable in this dress.
But you look beautiful.
It's one of her mother's dresses.
Look.
Look who's here.
Come on, Joana.
Who is it?
It's Carles.
Carles...
Come on, say something to her.
Daddy.
Doesn't she look pretty?
Radiant.
You'll see what a knock-out she looks in a wedding dress.
It's impossible to get near her.
That doctor is always there.
You won't find anything in that house.
Are you sure?
Fine.
In that case...
Let's go.
Right.
We'll be in touch with you just as soon as we have a signed statement.
That wretch will nevertalk.
He doesn't know who's paying him.
Sir?
What do you mean by that?
It's not the first time somebody's been snooping about yourfactory, but this time they tried to force the lock on your office door.
Let's not kid ourselves, this has nothing to do with anarchists.
I agree with you there.
If you had any idea who was behind this, you'd let me know, wouldn't you?
Now, if you'll excuse me...
Is there anything I should know?
Industrial espionage?
I'm only asking if apart from manufacturing weapons, you've also started your own line in lenses?
You know I've always been a very open-minded business woman.
I thought your determination would have waned after so many years.
Your military friends are very keen for you to make them a telescopic rifle, but one thing is selling something you still haven't manufactured and quite another is speculating with"borrowed" technology.
I hope you haven't come here just to insult me.
Just accept it!
I never manufactured the catadioptric lens.
You can look under every last stone on earth, but you won't find a thing.
I burnt it all.
So, as far as Joana Lenses is concerned, you can say goodbye to yourtelescopic rifle.
That's a pity.
We were hoping to invest in Joana Lenses.
I appreciate your generosity,
but we don't need your money.
Doesn't your pet have anything to say?
Goodbye, Lucille.
I'm not finished.
We've known each otherfor years,
I was hoping you'd invite me to your beautiful daughter's big day.
By the way, how is she?
My God, Lucille.
Don't you have any limits?
All right.
Now I'm going to ask you a question.
And I want you to tell me the truth.
During yourwork at the mansion as a servant, did you ever come into direct contact with Artur Prats' daughter?
Carles?
Is that you?
No, Ma'am.
It's me,
Vicent.
One of the servants.
See?
Oh, hello.
I was on my way to my room but I strayed off the path and now I need somebody to get me back to my route.
I see.
Where do you need to..?
If you can just wait a minute.
Whenever you're ready, Ma'am.
Can I ask you a question?
Go ahead.
Why did you stray from your route?
So I could see the stars.
They've started covering up my bedroom windows, and from time to time I need to look outside this"castle".
The night sky is one of the few things I can see just like everybody else.
Come here, take a look.
I'm sure if I pointed out all I can see up there, you'd be more lost than me.
For sure.
Truth be told, I'm also a bit lost down here.
That sounded sad.
I never know for sure when somebody is cheerful or angry or sad.
But I do have one trick.
Their breathing.
Breathing?
The way people breathe never lies.
Can you help me get back?
Where to?
To the handrail.
Of course.
Mind the step, Ma'am.
Thank you, Vicent.
Good night.
Good night, Ma'am.
And don't be sad.
One... two... and three.
Still dressed?
Yes, I know, I was miles away.
Sorry.
I'll walk you there.
No.
I can make it to the bath on my own.
Watch.
I'm sorry, Ma'am.
The Doctor didn't...
But it's right here by my side.
Really?
Yes.
Watch.
See?
Careful.
Mariano, in the cornerwith it.
Quickly.
Vicent!
Coming.
Can you help me with this?
Is the watertoo cold, Ma'am?
No, it's hot.
Could you bring me some lukewarm water?
I'd have to go downstairs forthat, and you know I can't leave you in the bath on your own.
What's going to happen?
I'm not going anywhere.
Daddy!
Vincent!
Joana!
It's all right, it's me, your dad.
Call Doctor Meissner!
Now!
Stand up.
What do you want?
What do you want from me?
Carles.
Good luck.
Good night, gentlemen.
Have you got a moment?
Can we talk?
We do need to talk.
Have a seat.
Be honest.
Do you still think that Dr Meissner won't be able to cure Joana?
I don't want to appear impertinent, but I need to talk to you about our current situation, the company's situation.
Since I came back, we haven't even...
We don't need a group of investors.
There's something I can't get out my head.
You told Lucille Prevert that you'd destroyed the formula of the lens.
Was that true?
I mean, if we could still make that lens, we'd soon get through bad patch without having to resort to investors.
Orto Holbein, naturally.
Anything but Holbein, you know that.
But we can choose our customers.
Just like we always have done.
Really?
Tell me how.
By tossing a coin to decide if they're any good?
You don't realise.
What's the matter?
What are you afraid of?
Stop worrying about the business, concern yourself more with your own affairs.
What are you trying to say?
Your daughter is all I care about.
I'd do absolutely anything for her, absolutely anything.
She will get better, Carles.
She will be cured.
And she'll be a marvellous mother and a marvellous wife.
See?
There's nothing there.
How did you do that?
It's magic.
Magic, he says.
The only magic things here are my balls.
That's real magic.
He took the flowerfrom the vase.
You're a fool, you look like a fool.
All right, let's see if you get this one.
Artur, you're absolutely right, the figures just don't add up.
We have to tighten our belts.
Eitherthat... or bankruptcy.
Vicent does him better.
Oh, yes, go on, do it for us.
Artur, if you like I could go to Madrid at the end of the month to close the deal.
It would be the answer to our prayers.
Carles...
Carles...
It's so nice to feel dizzy, Carles.
I look at you but I don't see you!
Why don't you give me a kiss?
Touch me, I can't see you!
Vicent!
Get out.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Get out of here!
It should never have happened.
Not like that.
I read your report again last night for a second time.
A quite extravagant option, if you don't mind me saying so.
The hypnosis sessions haven't produced anything.
Whateverthe secret Prats entrusted to his daughter, we're not going to find it in her subconscious.
I'm afraid this is the only alternative.
You've got three days to carry out a new mission.
Nobody's going to hurt her, are they?
Half yourfee is just in front of you.
"Darling daughter, if you hearthese words, it's because I'm no longer here.
Now, as I write these words, it's hard to believe, but I think that after all these years together
I've come to the conclusion that to really love somebody you have to accept that one day we won't be here to give the best of ourselves.
That is when we must make way for someone else.
I've organised it so you'll hear my last words from the lips of Carles,
who was like a son to me.
He'll look after you and the factory just as I always have.
I love you very much, my dear.
Very much indeed.
No fatherwants his children to get sick.
But your illness has made you special, just as special as your motherwas.
I've suffered a lot for you, you know that, but I want you to know,
I'd never have swapped the daughter you've been forthe daughter you might have been.
You've caused me more pain than anything, but you've also given me more happiness than I everthought I could aspire to in this life.
Your loving father."
Leave me, please.
You must cure her.
Understand?
Now more than ever.
You have to do it.
I promised Mr. Prats I wouldn't rest until I found a cure for his daughter.
And I will keep that promise.
The"Cocoon", remember?
We have to isolate her from all stimuli.
Sounds, images, tactile sensations, temperature, absolutely everything, for a period of three days.
That includes me, the servants and even you.
Any interaction with other people could ruin everything.
You mean lock her up forthree days.
I know it's tough but we can put a stop to these nervous fits.
To block out this confusing universe she is immersed in, she has to be totally isolated.
Begin the preparations immediately.
But whatever happens, we're getting married on the 6th of January.
Without any possible delay.
Without delay.
Aren't you going to eat?
Yes.
Excuse me, I was a little distracted.
I've tried on the tunic.
The doctor says I can't take it off.
I told him that in three days I'll at least have to do number ones.
He just started laughing.
And so did I.
Are you leaving now?
Yes.
I have to go.
I'd love to stay here with you, but it's late.
Carles, is it always going to be like this?
Of course not.
Why do you say that?
It's all right.
You go.
The doctor is convinced you will recover.
You'll see, when we are married.
You're so naughty!
Got any spare change, sir?
Do you want to take part orto watch?
Take part orwatch?
Watch.
Don't turn around.
Don't turn around.
I'm not even going to open it.
Leave it inside without making a noise.
Are you feeling okay?
Yes, sir.
Quick!
Call Margarita.
Joana?
Joana?
Who's that?
Doctor?
Is that you?
No, Joana, it's me.
Carles.
What?
Put the light on.
You see?
Carles, is something wrong?
No, nothing.
Don't fret.
I just had to see you.
Right now?
Are you crazy?
Let me explain.
Please...
I had to talk to you before the wedding and I thought that here without anybody about...
I've been doing some thinking...
About us... and the factory.
What are you trying to do?
Ruin the treatment?
I know you don't believe in Doctor Meissner, but don't spoil everything, please, even if it's just for daddy.
Please, leave.
I asked you to leave.
Why did you leave the room?
What went wrong?
I don't know.
I don't know, I thought maybe she had cottoned on.
What are you talking about?
Do you think she recognised you?
No, it's not that.
It's as if she could sense I wasn't telling the truth.
Are you getting cold feet?
No.
Then go back inside and follow our instructions.
Is everything in order, Doctor?
Yes.
The boy is going back in.
Carles, if you don't leave, I'm going to scream.
Just for a minute.
Carles, no.
You're very sad.
What do you expect?
Joana...
In all these years, I've never had the courage to tell you... what I really feel for you.
Are you trying to say you don't want to marry me?
Marry you?
There's nothing in this world I'd rather do more.
So you've already got what you wanted, haven't you?
Yes.
I have your hand, because yourfather gave it to me.
But I'd like to have asked you for it myself.
Aren't you going to say anything?
What am I meant to say?
Nothing.
I just wanted you to know.
I won't bother you any more.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the factory.
We've got so much work still to do.
Besides, I don't want to interfere with the treatment.
One more thing.
Yes?
I need...
I need yourfinger measurements.
If we wait any longer to orderthe rings, they won't be ready in time.
Would you mind if I came back tomorrow?
No.
Of course not.
Tomorrow.
I'll be here.
Go and find the accounts ledgers saved from the fire and send them on to me at home.
Very well.
The news got to Madrid quick enough.
Should I go in?
Not yet, no.
One thing is improvising to get out of a sticky situation, quite another is disobeying instructions.
When you go back in, take up the protocol again from the part about the wedding rings.
The wedding rings, yes.
Carles?
What are you doing?
It's a surprise.
A surprise?
Yes.
Close your eyes.
But...
Close your eyes.
Okay, okay.
I'm watching you.
Now?
No, just a minute.
Whenever you're ready.
It's my engagement present.
But if you don't like it, I can get you a jewel.
It's the most beautiful present I've ever been given.
They seem real.
How did you do it?
No, don't tell me.
I'd rather not know.
Joana...
What?
Forgive me.
What for?
For having been so distant all these years.
Are you all right?
Is something wrong?
My recollection of you was so different.
Joana, we're not exactly children any more.
The wedding ring.
I had to take your measurements.
Yes, that's right.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I thought you were about to"ask for my hand".
Well, in a way, that's what I am doing.
Don't you see, Carles?
We're doing everything the wrong way round!
You're right.
And it's all my fault.
Don't say that.
You and your dad always did that.
Exactly, it was something between him and I.
Forgive me.
I didn't mean to upset you.
I'm sorry.
I miss him so much.
So do I, Joana.
So do I.
Anything else, sir?
No, thank you, you can go.
Teresa?
Sir.
Margarita.
Excuse me.
Where is Doctor Meissner?
Actually, I don't know.
He should be in his bedroom.
Doctor.
Sir.
Can I help you with anything?
What would happen if she had a problem in there?
One of her attacks?
If what's worrying you is the storm, I can assure you her isolation is absolute.
Absolutely everything has been taken care of.
It's okay.
Leave us.
Carry on eating.
I'm not hungry.
It's obvious that you don't lack confidence in yourself.
Listen, in less than twelve hours, we have to return that girl to the world she was living in.
If you carry on playing this passionate version of Carles Lardin, the original by her side might suddenly look like a cheap fake in comparison.
And neither you nor I want that to happen.
For Joana's sake.
What do you want me to do now?
Enough beating about the bush.
When you go back in, ask her directly about the formula.
And this time, keep your enthusiasm under control.
What the hell?
What is it?
It's the thunder.
She can hear it!
Hear it?
Listen to me!
I don't care if she can hear it.
What concerns me is that we can't hear her.
Everything's been taken care of.
We paid you to make the cocoon soundproof, you idiot!
In the original cocoon...
not this one.
There's a panic button.
A panic button?
Don't worry.
The button is irrelevant because Joana won't be needing it.
Believe me,
that bell isn't going to ring.
Carles!
I understand you want to see her, you miss her.
All of us worry about Joana.
Me as much as anyone.
Please forgive me,
I'm...
I'm...
Joana!
Joana, Joana.
It's me.
Carles.
I'm here.
Everything the wrong way round.
Don't pull that face, Doctor.
Does it really surprise you?
This is our last day.
We've got to do something.
Of course we're going to do something.
You can't harm her.
We made a deal.
Indeed we did, and then you came up with this ridiculous circus performance.
What happened?
How long have I been asleep?
I don't know.
You were so tired, I didn't want to wake you.
What's that?
Daddy's photograph album.
Look, that's you at Christmas mass.
And how do you know that's me?
I know this book off by heart, and you're always the one who's next to Dad.
Well, almost always.
This will be the first year without him.
But now that Dad isn't here,
I suppose you'll be the crown prince, won't you?
No, I'm just a faithful squire, who will always protect you.
My faithful squire.
I like that.
I don't want you to worry, but I need to tell you something.
It's very important.
Joana?
Get the kid out of there.
He's had too many chances already.
What?
No!
Just a minute.
I said get him out of there now.
Carles?
I can't see you, Carles.
Carles?
Joana,
Joana, I'm not...
You're scaring me.
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
Listen to me.
There's no time.
I haven't found the courage to tell you before now.
I'm not...
What?
We can't escape this.
What are you talking about?
The thing is...
I'm not...
It's the business.
We're in a critical situation.
Because of the fire?
It's not just that.
We've been operating at a loss for months.
If it continues, we'll have to close Joana Lenses within the year.
But that can't be right.
Daddy never...
Your dad neverwanted you to worry.
Listen, Joana,
I've been thinking about it and I can only see one solution.
Manufacturing the catadioptric lens.
He didn't want to.
I wish there were anotherway, but it's our only salvation.
If we don't, we'll go bust.
Please, give me the formula.
What formula?
My dad never gave me any formula.
And all this... was because you wanted that formula?
How can you say that?
Don't you trust me?
Come here.
Come.
Sit down.
Close your eyes.
One.
Four.
Two.
Eight.
Seven.
Seven.
Nine.
Fantastic!
When I was a little girl and I went to the factory with my father, we used to pretend I was helping him in the lab.
He always wrote those numbers on the palm of my hand.
Always the same ones, always in the same order.
I don't know.
Do you think those numbers might be..?
I think so.
Joana,
I'm sorry it all had to be this way.
No, Carles.
I know you're only doing this to protect me.
I trust you.
Yes.
I have to get back to work.
I thought you'd gone to the jeweller already.
Yes, I did.
It's just I didn't want to give it back.
I thought you'd want to keep it until I give you the real one.
See you outside.
In a short while, my faithful squire.
The payment for your services is in your room.
Don't be long.
Doctor?
What will happen to her now?
Don't worry.
She's sleeping peacefully, and she's going to be fine, as fine as she can be.
You can't cure her, can you?
All that stuff about the treatment was lies.
Listen carefully, forthe last time.
Son of a bitch!
Look!
Overthere!
What's all this?
Sir, I...
The police were here, sir.
The police?
What did they want?
An escaped anarchist!
They thought he was here.
They took us into the kitchen while they searched the mansion!
That's enough.
Mr. Lardin!
There's a fellow here at the station with a very strange story.
Yes, I know, an anarchist.
What?
No, he's not an anarchist, not as far as I know.
I know this might sound strange, but he's made a statement saying he was forced to take part in a plot to kidnap Joana Prats.
What are you talking about?
That's absurd!
Yes, but you understand it's our duty to check out his story.
Hold on.
You came to my house looking for an anarchist?
No, no.
What are you talking about?
We haven't been near your house.
But, Sir, it's still not time!
Go and find Dr. Meissner!
Joana?
Thank God.
Are you alright?
Of course I am!
I was so looking forward to seeing you.
So, three days here on you own.
Yes,"on my own".
Doctor Meissner isn't here yet.
We'll have to wait a while.
Do you know what we could do?
No.
I see you're feeling better.
Do you notice anything different?
Everything is different.
You know what?
I think I've even got over my fear of thunder storms.
Wait a moment.
You heard the thunder?
A little.
It was very distant.
Maybe I heard it because I'm getting better.
Maybe.
Excuse me, sir.
Good morning.
I hate to interrupt...
It's okay, darling.
Go about your business.
I'll see you later.
Marga, can you bring some more butter, please?
Yes, Ma'am.
The entrance was here.
And her bed was there.
And they controlled it all from up there.
They?
That's enough.
Let's get out of here.
Come in.
Sir, I don't mean to disturb you...
What time is it?
It's seven o'clock.
Madam has already had dinner.
Would you like to have some?
No.
Maybe later.
Has Doctor Meissner called?
Shall I call the police?
No, not forthe time being.
Thank you.
I think Marga almost saw me.
Joana!
What are you doing?
I couldn't stand it anymore.
What is it?
I had to see you.
Joana, the servants!
We'll be very quiet.
Be careful.
Careful.
Just take it slowly.
Joana, please, the books.
I was so scared that it was alljust a dream, these last three days.
I thought I wouldn't be able to stand being locked up, but when I saw you come in the door,
I was simply dying for you to walk in.
You really mean that?
Yes.
Carles...
Oh, Carles...
What is it, Joana?
Who are you?
Joana, it's me, darling.
It's me.
Last night, you seemed like someone else.
Last night?
Well?
I know it isn't pleasant.
It's a load of rubbish.
However, this man seems to have a lot of information on you.
From having worked in my house.
Well, that's what he claims.
You don't give this any credibility?
Absolutely none whatsoever.
In any case, it's easy to check whether he everworked in my house.
Is Joana all right?
How could you do something like that?
They didn't give me much choice.
They knew everything about you.
Everything except that damn formula.
That formula doesn't exist.
Joana gave it to me.
They wanted to torture her.
I did it to save her.
Save her?
You?
She doesn't even know you exist.
Ask her about that.
What are you saying?
You don't deserve her.
You don't respect her as a woman.
You can't give her what she wants.
One day, she'll work out that you're not the man she was with.
And by then I won't be in here.
There's no proof against me.
If you want to accuse me of something,
you'll have to let Joana explain what happened between us to the whole world.
If you go anywhere near her again,
I swearto God I'll kill you!
I'll kill you.
Everything alright?
Out, out.
How could you?
How could something like this happen?
It makes my head spin.
Did you know that good-for-nothing worked in this house?
Vicent!
The servant we dismissed!
I see you remember the bastard well enough.
Carles, I swearto God that I thought it was you!
I swear.
Well, I'm afraid that's not the way it was.
Carles, wait.
I wanted it to be you with all my heart.
Mister Lardin.
Bitch.
I'm with guests.
If you have something you'd like to say to me...
You... and Meissner and that servant... have taken everything from me.
I have nothing left.
Mister Lardin,
get married, sell the business, and stop worrying,
I never leave loose ends.
Happy Christmas, sir.
Mister Lardin, Mister Lardin...
Happy Christmas.
We are very sad about the loss of Mr. Prats.
Joana.
Joana!
It's you!
Stop or I'll shoot!
Joana!
No!
Joana, Joana...
Are you okay?
It's me.
Is it you?
Oh, my God.
Fetch a doctor!
Somebody find a doctor!
What is it?
What do you want?
Leave me.
Joana.
Joana?
Joana.
I'm here.
Carles?
No.
No, Joana, it's me.
My faithful squire.
PYRENEES, 1892
This way, gentlemen.
Gentlemen, I won't keep you waiting any longer.
As you know, Holbein lndustries have manufactured the best weapons for many years now.
But to truly revolutionize our industry...
Gentlemen, I give you...
Artur Prats.
I'm a man of few words.
So I'll keep this short.
Above all, I'd like you to see for yourselves what we've got here to show you today.
Please, come and look through the telescopes.
Tell me, how many balloons can you see?
I see two.
These are the best telescopes on the market.
We already know these models.
I know.
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
I'm sorry, Daddy.
Forgive me.
I'm not your dad.
Joana, I'm here now.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Oh, God.
Are you okay?
Daddy?
Look at me, look at me, darling!
Joana, look at me.
Extra, extra!
Another anarchist bomb attack!
Seven murdered and fifteen injured in Almirall street!
Stay still!
No, not his face!
Just calm down.
What happened?
I was fired.
Why?
It's complicated.
Then start at the beginning.
1 1 DAYS earlier
The day begins at half past five in the morning.
At five on Tuesdays, and at four o'clock if you have to go to market.
You'll have to make sure all the doors and windows are shut tight before night falls.
From that moment on, no one is allowed on Madam's floor.
Any problem with that?
None at all.
Close up everything before dark and ask before going upstairs.
Piece of cake.
Hold on.
Let me do it.
This is where Ma'am sits.
What's that for?
To tell them apart.
It seems she can distinguish colours.
That's why we all wear rosettes.
You see?
Marga, that's not exactly true.
We get branded here like cattle because of that freak of nature.
Mariano, cut that out!
Take that back this instant.
Mariano... lt's Mr. Lardin.
He was meant to be back tomorrow.
He's decided to come back early.
Get to your positions.
Set another place, Margarita.
Carles is hungry!
Thank you.
Who is this Carles?
Carles Lardin, Madam's fiance.
I'm going back to Madrid before the end of the month.
If you agree, we can close the deal.
-Fine.
-lt's the answerto our prayers.
That's great.
But let's leave business until tomorrow.
Your return couldn't be more timely.
How come?
I'd ratherthe Doctortold us.
Meissner has returned?
Not exactly.
What?
is he still here?
I won't be for much longer, I assure you.
Excuse me, Doctor, I didn't mean to...
Don't worry, Carles.
What he means is that...
Well, you explain it.
My pleasure.
I'm very pleased to be here this evening to announce that, after having studied Joana's case exhaustively, I can finally give you a diagnosis.
Really?
Are you completely sure?
Please.
The hypnosis sessions with Joana couldn't have been more revealing.
Hypnosis?
Allow me to explain.
We knew Joana had problems recognising sounds, objects and also people, but we didn't understand why.
Well, now I am quite sure.
Imagine that this jug contains all the stimuli reality offers us.
Images, sounds, smells, etc.
Now when you look at this glass, think of it as a brain, young, healthy and pure.
From the day we're born to the day we die,
this is all we actually perceive of reality.
Thanks to this filter, we can separate out that extra information which would otherwise submerge our minds in chaos.
Unfortunately, this is not the case for Joana.
The encephalitis she had as a child destroyed that filter.
Since then, an excess of information has been reaching Joana's brain.
Her brain can't process it or remember... I am sorry.
Don't worry.
What are you driving at with all of this?
The sound proofing of her bedroom is almost ready, but I fear it isn't enough.
We need to seal the room completely.
No inside or outside light.
What?
You want to put her in a cage?
No. "Cocoon"
would be a more fitting description.
We'll finish this conversation later.
Joana.
I don't feel very comfortable in this dress.
But you look beautiful.
It's one of her mother's dresses.
Look.
Look who's here.
Come on, Joana.
Who is it?
It's Carles.
Carles...
-Come on, say something to her.
-Daddy.
Doesn't she look pretty?
Radiant.
You'll see what a knock-out she looks in a wedding dress.
It's impossible to get near her.
That doctor is always there.
You won't find anything in that house.
Are you sure?
Fine. ln that case...
Let's go.
Right.
We'll be in touch with you just as soon as we have a signed statement.
That wretch will nevertalk.
He doesn't know who's paying him.
Sir?
What do you mean by that?
It's not the first time somebody's been snooping about yourfactory, but this time they tried to force the lock on your office door.
Let's not kid ourselves, this has nothing to do with anarchists.
I agree with you there.
If you had any idea who was behind this, you'd let me know, wouldn't you?
Now, if you'll excuse me... ls there anything I should know?
Industrial espionage?
I'm only asking if apart from manufacturing weapons, you've also started your own line in lenses?
You know I've always been a very open-minded business woman.
I thought your determination would have waned after so many years.
Your military friends are very keen for you to make them a telescopic rifle, but one thing is selling something you still haven't manufactured and quite another is speculating with "borrowed" technology.
I hope you haven't come here just to insult me.
Just accept it!
I never manufactured the catadioptric lens.
You can look under every last stone on earth, but you won't find a thing.
I burnt it all.
So, as far as Joana Lenses is concerned, you can say goodbye to yourtelescopic rifle.
That's a pity.
We were hoping to invest in Joana Lenses.
I appreciate your generosity,
but we don't need your money.
Doesn't your pet have anything to say?
-Goodbye, Lucille.
-l'm not finished.
We've known each otherfor years, I was hoping you'd invite me to your beautiful daughter's big day.
By the way, how is she?
My God, Lucille.
Don't you have any limits?
All right.
Now I'm going to ask you a question.
And I want you to tell me the truth.
During yourwork at the mansion as a servant, did you ever come into direct contact with Artur Prats' daughter?
Carles?
is that you?
No, Ma'am.
It's me,
Vicent.
One of the servants.
See?
Oh, hello.
I was on my way to my room but I strayed off the path and now I need somebody to get me back to my route.
I see.
Where do you need to...?
If you can just wait a minute.
Whenever you're ready, Ma'am.
Can I ask you a question?
Go ahead.
Why did you stray from your route?
So I could see the stars.
They've started covering up my bedroom windows, and from time to time I need to look outside this "castle".
The night sky is one of the few things I can see just like everybody else.
Come here, take a look.
I'm sure if I pointed out all I can see up there, you'd be more lost than me.
For sure.
Truth be told, I'm also a bit lost down here.
That sounded sad.
I never know for sure when somebody is cheerful or angry or sad.
But I do have one trick.
Their breathing.
Breathing?
The way people breathe never lies.
Can you help me get back?
-Where to?
-To the handrail.
Of course.
Mind the step, Ma'am.
Thank you, Vicent.
Good night.
Good night, Ma'am.
And don't be sad.
One... two... and three.
Still dressed?
Yes, I know, I was miles away.
Sorry.
-l'll walk you there.
-No.
I can make it to the bath on my own.
Watch.
I'm sorry, Ma'am.
The Doctor didn't...
But it's right here by my side.
Really?
Yes.
Watch.
See?
Careful.
-Mariano, in the cornerwith it.
-Quickly.
-Vicent!
-Coming.
Can you help me with this?
is the watertoo cold, Ma'am?
No, it's hot.
Could you bring me some lukewarm water?
I'd have to go downstairs forthat, and you know I can't leave you in the bath on your own.
What's going to happen?
I'm not going anywhere.
Daddy!
Vincent!
Joana!
It's all right, it's me, your dad.
Call Doctor Meissner!
Now!
Stand up.
What do you want?
What do you want from me?
Carles.
Good luck.
Good night, gentlemen.
Have you got a moment?
Can we talk?
We do need to talk.
Have a seat.
Be honest.
Do you still think that Dr Meissner won't be able to cure Joana?
I don't want to appear impertinent, but I need to talk to you about our current situation, the company's situation.
Since I came back, we haven't even...
We don't need a group of investors.
There's something I can't get out my head.
You told Lucille Prevert that you'd destroyed the formula of the lens.
Was that true?
I mean, if we could still make that lens, we'd soon get through bad patch without having to resort to investors.
Orto Holbein, naturally.
Anything but Holbein, you know that.
But we can choose our customers.
Just like we always have done.
Really?
Tell me how.
By tossing a coin to decide if they're any good?
You don't realise.
What's the matter?
What are you afraid of?
Stop worrying about the business, concern yourself more with your own affairs.
What are you trying to say?
Your daughter is all I care about.
I'd do absolutely anything for her, absolutely anything.
She will get better, Carles.
She will be cured.
And she'll be a marvellous mother and a marvellous wife.
See?
There's nothing there.
How did you do that?
It's magic.
Magic, he says.
The only magic things here are my balls.
That's real magic.
He took the flowerfrom the vase.
You're a fool, you look like a fool.
All right, let's see if you get this one.
Artur, you're absolutely right, the figures just don't add up.
We have to tighten our belts.
Eitherthat... or bankruptcy.
Vicent does him better.
Oh, yes, go on, do it for us.
Artur, if you like I could go to Madrid at the end of the month to close the deal.
It would be the answer to our prayers.
Carles...
Carles... lt's so nice to feel dizzy, Carles.
I look at you but I don't see you!
Why don't you give me a kiss?
Touch me, I can't see you!
Vicent!
Get out.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Get out of here!
It should never have happened.
Not like that.
I read your report again last night for a second time.
A quite extravagant option, if you don't mind me saying so.
The hypnosis sessions haven't produced anything.
Whateverthe secret Prats entrusted to his daughter, we're not going to find it in her subconscious.
I'm afraid this is the only alternative.
You've got three days to carry out a new mission.
Nobody's going to hurt her, are they?
Half yourfee is just in front of you.
"Darling daughter, if you hearthese words, it's because I'm no longer here.
Now, as I write these words, it's hard to believe, but I think that after all these years together I've come to the conclusion that to really love somebody you have to accept that one day
we won't be here to give the best of ourselves.
That is when we must make way for someone else.
I've organised it so you'll hear my last words from the lips of Carles,
who was like a son to me.
He'll look after you and the factory just as I always have.
I love you very much, my dear.
Very much indeed.
No fatherwants his children to get sick.
But your illness has made you special, just as special as your motherwas.
I've suffered a lot for you, you know that, but I want you to know, I'd never have swapped the daughter you've been forthe daughter you might have been.
You've caused me more pain than anything, but you've also given me more happiness than I everthought I could aspire to in this life.
Your loving father."
Leave me, please.
You must cure her.
Understand?
Now more than ever.
You have to do it.
I promised Mr. Prats l wouldn't rest until I found a cure for his daughter.
And I will keep that promise.
The "Cocoon", remember?
We have to isolate her from all stimuli.
Sounds, images, tactile sensations, temperature, absolutely everything, for a period of three days.
That includes me, the servants and even you.
Any interaction with other people could ruin everything.
You mean lock her up forthree days.
I know it's tough but we can put a stop to these nervous fits.
To block out this confusing universe she is immersed in, she has to be totally isolated.
Begin the preparations immediately.
But whatever happens, we're getting married on the 6th of January.
Without any possible delay.
Without delay.
Aren't you going to eat?
Yes.
Excuse me, I was a little distracted.
I've tried on the tunic.
The doctor says I can't take it off.
I told him that in three days I'll at least have to do number ones.
He just started laughing.
And so did I.
-Are you leaving now?
-Yes.
I have to go.
I'd love to stay here with you, but it's late.
Carles, is it always going to be like this?
Of course not.
Why do you say that?
It's all right.
You go.
The doctor is convinced you will recover.
You'll see, when we are married.
You're so naughty!
Got any spare change, sir?
Do you want to take part orto watch?
Take part orwatch?
Watch.
Don't turn around.
Don't turn around.
I'm not even going to open it.
Leave it inside without making a noise.
-Are you feeling okay?
-Yes, sir.
Quick!
Call Margarita.
Joana?
Joana?
Who's that?
Doctor?
is that you?
No, Joana, it's me.
Carles.
What?
Put the light on.
You see?
Carles, is something wrong?
No, nothing.
Don't fret.
I just had to see you.
Right now?
Are you crazy?
Let me explain.
Please... I had to talk to you before the wedding and I thought that here without anybody about... I've been doing some thinking...
About us... and the factory.
What are you trying to do?
Ruin the treatment?
I know you don't believe in Doctor Meissner, but don't spoil everything, please, even if it's just for daddy.
Please, leave.
I asked you to leave.
Why did you leave the room?
What went wrong?
I don't know.
I don't know, I thought maybe she had cottoned on.
What are you talking about?
Do you think she recognised you?
No, it's not that.
It's as if she could sense I wasn't telling the truth.
-Are you getting cold feet?
-No.
Then go back inside and follow our instructions.
is everything in order, Doctor?
Yes.
The boy is going back in.
Carles, if you don't leave, I'm going to scream.
-Just for a minute.
-Carles, no.
-You're very sad.
-What do you expect?
Joana... ln all these years, I've never had the courage
to tell you... what I really feel for you.
Are you trying to say you don't want to marry me?
Marry you?
There's nothing in this world I'd rather do more.
So you've already got what you wanted, haven't you?
Yes.
I have your hand, because yourfather gave it to me.
But I'd like to have asked you for it myself.
Aren't you going to say anything?
What am I meant to say?
Nothing.
I just wanted you to know.
I won't bother you any more.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the factory.
We've got so much work still to do.
Besides, I don't want to interfere with the treatment.
-One more thing.
-Yes?
I need... I need yourfinger measurements.
If we wait any longer to orderthe rings, they won't be ready in time.
Would you mind if I came back tomorrow?
No.
Of course not.
Tomorrow.
I'll be here.
Go and find the accounts ledgers saved from the fire and send them on to me at home.
Very well.
The news got to Madrid quick enough.
-Should I go in?
-Not yet, no.
One thing is improvising to get out of a sticky situation, quite another is disobeying instructions.
When you go back in, take up the protocol again from the part about the wedding rings.
The wedding rings, yes.
Carles?
What are you doing?
It's a surprise.
-A surprise?
-Yes.
Close your eyes.
But...
-Close your eyes.
-Okay, okay.
I'm watching you.
Now?
No, just a minute.
Whenever you're ready.
It's my engagement present.
But if you don't like it, I can get you a jewel.
It's the most beautiful present I've ever been given.
They seem real.
How did you do it?
No, don't tell me.
I'd rather not know.
Joana...
What?
Forgive me.
What for?
For having been so distant all these years.
Are you all right?
is something wrong?
My recollection of you was so different.
Joana, we're not exactly children any more.
The wedding ring.
I had to take your measurements.
Yes, that's right.
What's the matter?
Nothing. I thought you were about to "ask for my hand".
Well, in a way, that's what I am doing.
Don't you see, Carles?
We're doing everything the wrong way round!
You're right.
And it's all my fault.
Don't say that.
You and your dad always did that.
Exactly, it was something between him and I.
Forgive me.
I didn't mean to upset you.
I'm sorry.
I miss him so much.
So do I, Joana.
So do I.
Anything else, sir?
No, thank you, you can go.
Teresa?
-Sir.
-Margarita.
Excuse me.
Where is Doctor Meissner?
Actually, I don't know.
He should be in his bedroom.
Doctor.
Sir.
Can I help you with anything?
What would happen if she had a problem in there?
One of her attacks?
If what's worrying you is the storm, I can assure you her isolation is absolute.
Absolutely everything has been taken care of.
It's okay.
Leave us.
Carry on eating.
I'm not hungry.
It's obvious that you don't lack confidence in yourself.
Listen, in less than twelve hours, we have to return that girl to the world she was living in.
If you carry on playing this passionate version of Carles Lardin, the original by her side might suddenly look like a cheap fake in comparison.
And neither you nor I want that to happen.
For Joana's sake.
What do you want me to do now?
Enough beating about the bush.
When you go back in, ask her directly about the formula.
And this time, keep your enthusiasm under control.
What the hell?
What is it?
-lt's the thunder.
She can hear it!
-Hear it?
Listen to me!
I don't care if she can hear it.
What concerns me is that we can't hear her.
Everything's been taken care of.
We paid you to make the cocoon soundproof, you idiot!
In the original cocoon...
not this one.
There's a panic button.
A panic button?
Don't worry.
The button is irrelevant because Joana won't be needing it.
Believe me,
that bell isn't going to ring.
Carles!
I understand you want to see her, you miss her.
All of us worry about Joana.
Me as much as anyone.
Please forgive me, I'm... I'm...
Joana!
Joana, Joana.
It's me.
Carles. I'm here.
Everything the wrong way round.
Don't pull that face, Doctor.
Does it really surprise you?
This is our last day.
We've got to do something.
Of course we're going to do something.
You can't harm her.
We made a deal.
Indeed we did, and then you came up with this ridiculous circus performance.
What happened?
How long have I been asleep?
I don't know.
You were so tired, I didn't want to wake you.
What's that?
Daddy's photograph album.
Look, that's you at Christmas mass.
And how do you know that's me?
I know this book off by heart, and you're always the one who's next to Dad.
Well, almost always.
This will be the first year without him.
But now that Dad isn't here,
I suppose you'll be the crown prince, won't you?
No, I'm just a faithful squire, who will always protect you.
My faithful squire.
I like that.
I don't want you to worry, but I need to tell you something.
It's very important.
Joana?
Get the kid out of there.
He's had too many chances already.
What?
No!
Just a minute.
I said get him out of there now.
Carles?
I can't see you, Carles.
Carles?
Joana,
Joana, I'm not...
You're scaring me.
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
Listen to me.
There's no time.
I haven't found the courage to tell you before now.
-l'm not...
-What?
We can't escape this.
-What are you talking about?
-The thing is... I'm not... lt's the business.
We're in a critical situation.
Because of the fire?
It's not just that.
We've been operating at a loss for months.
If it continues, we'll have to close Joana Lenses within the year.
But that can't be right.
Daddy never...
Your dad neverwanted you to worry.
Listen, Joana, I've been thinking about it
and I can only see one solution.
Manufacturing the catadioptric lens.
-He didn't want to.
-l wish there were anotherway, but it's our only salvation.
If we don't, we'll go bust.
Please, give me the formula.
What formula?
My dad never gave me any formula.
And all this... was because you wanted that formula?
How can you say that?
Don't you trust me?
Come here.
Come.
Sit down.
Close your eyes.
One.
Four.
Two.
Eight.
Seven.
Seven.
Nine.
Fantastic!
When I was a little girl and I went to the factory with my father, we used to pretend I was helping him in the lab.
He always wrote those numbers on the palm of my hand.
Always the same ones, always in the same order.
I don't know.
Do you think those numbers might be...?
I think so.
Joana, I'm sorry it all had to be this way.
No, Carles. I know you're only doing this to protect me.
I trust you.
Yes.
I have to get back to work.
I thought you'd gone to the jeweller already.
Yes, I did.
It's just I didn't want to give it back.
I thought you'd want to keep it until I give you the real one.
See you outside.
In a short while, my faithful squire.
The payment for your services is in your room.
Don't be long.
Doctor?
What will happen to her now?
Don't worry.
She's sleeping peacefully, and she's going to be fine, as fine as she can be.
You can't cure her, can you?
All that stuff about the treatment was lies.
Listen carefully, forthe last time.
Son of a bitch!
Look!
Overthere!
What's all this?
Sir, I...
The police were here, sir.
The police?
What did they want?
-An escaped anarchist!
-They thought he was here.
They took us into the kitchen while they searched the mansion!
That's enough.
Mr. Lardin!
There's a fellow here at the station with a very strange story.
Yes, I know, an anarchist.
What?
No, he's not an anarchist, not as far as I know.
I know this might sound strange, but he's made a statement saying he was forced to take part in a plot to kidnap Joana Prats.
What are you talking about?
That's absurd!
Yes, but you understand it's our duty to check out his story.
Hold on.
You came to my house looking for an anarchist?
No, no.
What are you talking about?
We haven't been near your house.
But, Sir, it's still not time!
Go and find Dr. Meissner!
Joana?
Thank God.
-Are you alright?
-Of course I am!
I was so looking forward to seeing you.
So, three days here on you own.
Yes, "on my own".
Doctor Meissner isn't here yet.
We'll have to wait a while.
Do you know what we could do?
No.
I see you're feeling better.
Do you notice anything different?
Everything is different.
You know what?
I think I've even got over my fear of thunder storms.
Wait a moment.
You heard the thunder?
A little. lt was very distant.
Maybe I heard it because I'm getting better.
Maybe.
Excuse me, sir.
Good morning.
I hate to interrupt... lt's okay, darling.
Go about your business.
I'll see you later.
Marga, can you bring some more butter, please?
Yes, Ma'am.
The entrance was here.
And her bed was there.
And they controlled it all from up there.
They?
That's enough.
Let's get out of here.
Come in.
Sir, I don't mean to disturb you...
-What time is it?
-lt's seven o'clock.
Madam has already had dinner.
Would you like to have some?
No.
Maybe later.
Has Doctor Meissner called?
-Shall I call the police?
-No, not forthe time being.
Thank you.
I think Marga almost saw me.
Joana!
What are you doing?
-l couldn't stand it anymore.
-What is it?
I had to see you.
Joana, the servants!
We'll be very quiet.
Be careful.
Careful.
Just take it slowly.
Joana, please, the books.
I was so scared that it was alljust a dream, these last three days.
I thought I wouldn't be able to stand being locked up, but when I saw you come in the door, I was simply dying for you to walk in.
-You really mean that?
-Yes.
Carles...
Oh, Carles...
What is it, Joana?
Who are you?
Joana, it's me, darling.
It's me.
Last night, you seemed like someone else.
Last night?
Well?
I know it isn't pleasant.
It's a load of rubbish.
However, this man seems to have a lot of information on you.
From having worked in my house.
Well, that's what he claims.
You don't give this any credibility?
Absolutely none whatsoever.
In any case, it's easy to check whether he everworked in my house.
is Joana all right?
How could you do something like that?
They didn't give me much choice.
They knew everything about you.
Everything except that damn formula.
That formula doesn't exist.
Joana gave it to me.
They wanted to torture her.
I did it to save her.
Save her?
You?
-She doesn't even know you exist.
-Ask her about that.
-What are you saying?
-You don't deserve her.
You don't respect her as a woman.
You can't give her what she wants.
One day, she'll work out that you're not the man she was with.
And by then I won't be in here.
There's no proof against me.
If you want to accuse me of something,
you'll have to let Joana explain what happened between us to the whole world.
If you go anywhere near her again, I swearto God I'll kill you!
I'll kill you.
Everything alright?
Out, out.
How could you?
How could something like this happen?
It makes my head spin.
Did you know that good-for-nothing worked in this house?
Vicent!
The servant we dismissed!
I see you remember the bastard well enough.
Carles, I swearto God that I thought it was you!
I swear.
Well, I'm afraid that's not the way it was.
Carles, wait.
I wanted it to be you with all my heart.
Mister Lardin.
Bitch.
I'm with guests.
If you have something you'd like to say to me...
You... and Meissner and that servant... have taken everything from me.
I have nothing left.
Mister Lardin, get married, sell the business, and stop worrying,
I never leave loose ends.
Happy Christmas, sir.
Mister Lardin, Mister Lardin...
Happy Christmas.
We are very sad about the loss of Mr. Prats.
Joana.
Joana!
It's you!
Stop or I'll shoot!
Joana!
No!
Joana, Joana...
Are you okay?
It's me.
is it you?
Oh, my God.
Fetch a doctor!
Somebody find a doctor!
What is it?
What do you want?
Leave me.
Joana.
Joana?
Joana.
I'm here.
-Carles?
-No.
No, Joana, it's me.
My faithful squire.

PYRENEES, 1892
This way, gentlemen.
Gentlemen,
I won't keep you waiting any longer.
As you know, Holbein lndustries have manufactured the best weapons for many years now.
But to truly revolutionize our industry...
Gentlemen, I give you...
Artur Prats.
I'm a man of few words.
So I'll keep this short.
Above all, I'd like you to see for yourselves what we've got here to show you today.
Please, come and look through the telescopes.
Tell me, how many balloons can you see?
I see two.
These are the best telescopes on the market.
We already know these models.
I know.
Joana.
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
I'm sorry, Daddy.
Forgive me.
I'm not your dad.
Joana, I'm here now.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Oh, God.
Are you okay?
Daddy?
Look at me, look at me, darling!
Joana, look at me.
BARCELONA, 1899
Extra, extra!
Another anarchist bomb attack!
Seven murdered and fifteen injured in Almirall street!
Stay still!
No, not his face!
Just calm down.
What happened?
I was fired.
Why?
It's complicated.
Then start at the beginning.
11 DAYS EARLIER
The day begins at half past five in the morning.
At five on Tuesdays, and at four o'clock if you have to go to market.
You'll have to make sure all the doors and windows are shut tight before night falls.
From that moment on, no one is allowed on Madam's floor.
Any problem with that?
None at all.
Close up everything before dark and ask before going upstairs.
Piece of cake.
Hold on.
Let me do it.
This is where Ma'am sits.
What's that for?
To tell them apart.
It seems she can distinguish colours.
That's why we all wear rosettes.
You see?
Marga, that's not exactly true.
We get branded here like cattle because of that freak of nature.
Mariano, cut that out!
Take that back this instant.
Mariano...
It's Mr. Lardin.
He was meant to be back tomorrow.
He's decided to come back early.
Get to your positions.
Set another place, Margarita.
Carles is hungry!
Thank you.
Who is this Carles?
Carles Lardin, Madam's fiance.
I'm going back to Madrid before the end of the month.
If you agree, we can close the deal.
-Fine.
-It's the answerto our prayers.
That's great.
But let's leave business until tomorrow.
Your return couldn't be more timely.
How come?
I'd ratherthe Doctortold us.
Meissner has returned?
Not exactly.
What?
Is he still here?
I won't be for much longer, I assure you.
Excuse me, Doctor, I didn't mean to...
Don't worry, Carles.
What he means is that...
Well, you explain it.
My pleasure.
I'm very pleased to be here this evening to announce that, after having studied Joana's case exhaustively,
I can finally give you a diagnosis.
Really?
Are you completely sure?
Please.
The hypnosis sessions with Joana couldn't have been more revealing.
Hypnosis?
Allow me to explain.
We knew Joana had problems recognising sounds, objects and also people, but we didn't understand why.
Well, now I am quite sure.
Imagine that this jug contains all the stimuli reality offers us.
Images, sounds, smells, etc.
Now when you look at this glass, think of it as a brain, young, healthy and pure.
From the day we're born to the day we die,
this is all we actually perceive of reality.
Thanks to this filter, we can separate out that extra information which would otherwise submerge our minds in chaos.
Unfortunately, this is not the case for Joana.
The encephalitis she had as a child destroyed that filter.
Since then, an excess of information has been reaching Joana's brain.
Her brain can't process it or remember...
I am sorry.
Don't worry.
What are you driving at with all of this?
The sound proofing of her bedroom is almost ready, but I fear it isn't enough.
We need to seal the room completely.
No inside or outside light.
What?
You want to put her in a cage?
No. "Cocoon"
would be a more fitting description.
We'll finish this conversation later.
Joana.
I don't feel very comfortable in this dress.
But you look beautiful.
It's one of her mother's dresses.
Look.
Look who's here.
Come on, Joana.
Who is it?
It's Carles.
Carles...
-Come on, say something to her.
-Daddy.
Doesn't she look pretty?
Radiant.
You'll see what a knock-out she looks in a wedding dress.
It's impossible to get near her.
That doctor is always there.
You won't find anything in that house.
Are you sure?
Fine.
In that case...
Let's go.
Right.
We'll be in touch with you just as soon as we have a signed statement.
That wretch will nevertalk.
He doesn't know who's paying him.
Sir?
What do you mean by that?
It's not the first time somebody's been snooping about yourfactory, but this time they tried to force the lock on your office door.
Let's not kid ourselves, this has nothing to do with anarchists.
I agree with you there.
If you had any idea who was behind this, you'd let me know, wouldn't you?
Now, if you'll excuse me...
Is there anything I should know?
Industrial espionage?
I'm only asking if apart from manufacturing weapons, you've also started your own line in lenses?
You know I've always been a very open-minded business woman.
I thought your determination would have waned after so many years.
Your military friends are very keen for you to make them a telescopic rifle, but one thing is selling something you still haven't manufactured and quite another is speculating with "borrowed" technology.
I hope you haven't come here just to insult me.
Just accept it!
I never manufactured the catadioptric lens.
You can look under every last stone on earth, but you won't find a thing.
I burnt it all.
So, as far as Joana Lenses is concerned, you can say goodbye to yourtelescopic rifle.
That's a pity.
We were hoping to invest in Joana Lenses.
I appreciate your generosity,
but we don't need your money.
Doesn't your pet have anything to say?
-Goodbye, Lucille.
-I'm not finished.
We've known each otherfor years,
I was hoping you'd invite me to your beautiful daughter's big day.
By the way, how is she?
My God, Lucille.
Don't you have any limits?
All right.
Now I'm going to ask you a question.
And I want you to tell me the truth.
During yourwork at the mansion as a servant, did you ever come into direct contact with Artur Prats' daughter?
Carles?
Is that you?
No, Ma'am.
It's me,
Vicent.
One of the servants.
See?
Oh, hello.
I was on my way to my room but I strayed off the path and now I need somebody to get me back to my route.
I see.
Where do you need to...?
If you can just wait a minute.
Whenever you're ready, Ma'am.
Can I ask you a question?
Go ahead.
Why did you stray from your route?
So I could see the stars.
They've started covering up my bedroom windows, and from time to time I need to look outside this "castle".
The night sky is one of the few things I can see just like everybody else.
Come here, take a look.
I'm sure if I pointed out all I can see up there, you'd be more lost than me.
For sure.
Truth be told, I'm also a bit lost down here.
That sounded sad.
I never know for sure when somebody is cheerful or angry or sad.
But I do have one trick.
Their breathing.
Breathing?
The way people breathe never lies.
Can you help me get back?
-Where to?
-To the handrail.
Of course.
Mind the step, Ma'am.
Thank you, Vicent.
Good night.
Good night, Ma'am.
And don't be sad.
One... two... and three.
Still dressed?
Yes, I know, I was miles away.
Sorry.
-I'll walk you there.
-No.
I can make it to the bath on my own.
Watch.
I'm sorry, Ma'am.
The Doctor didn't...
But it's right here by my side.
Really?
Yes.
Watch.
See?
Careful.
-Mariano, in the cornerwith it.
-Quickly.
-Vicent!
-Coming.
Can you help me with this?
Is the watertoo cold, Ma'am?
No, it's hot.
Could you bring me some lukewarm water?
I'd have to go downstairs forthat, and you know I can't leave you in the bath on your own.
What's going to happen?
I'm not going anywhere.
Daddy!
Vincent!
Joana!
It's all right, it's me, your dad.
Call Doctor Meissner!
Now!
Stand up.
What do you want?
What do you want from me?
Carles.
Good luck.
Good night, gentlemen.
Have you got a moment?
Can we talk?
We do need to talk.
Have a seat.
Be honest.
Do you still think that Dr Meissner won't be able to cure Joana?
I don't want to appear impertinent, but I need to talk to you about our current situation, the company's situation.
Since I came back, we haven't even...
We don't need a group of investors.
There's something I can't get out my head.
You told Lucille Prevert that you'd destroyed the formula of the lens.
Was that true?
I mean, if we could still make that lens, we'd soon get through bad patch without having to resort to investors.
Orto Holbein, naturally.
Anything but Holbein, you know that.
But we can choose our customers.
Just like we always have done.
Really?
Tell me how.
By tossing a coin to decide if they're any good?
You don't realise.
What's the matter?
What are you afraid of?
Stop worrying about the business, concern yourself more with your own affairs.
What are you trying to say?
Your daughter is all I care about.
I'd do absolutely anything for her, absolutely anything.
She will get better, Carles.
She will be cured.
And she'll be a marvellous mother and a marvellous wife.
See?
There's nothing there.
How did you do that?
It's magic.
Magic, he says.
The only magic things here are my balls.
That's real magic.
He took the flowerfrom the vase.
You're a fool, you look like a fool.
All right, let's see if you get this one.
Artur, you're absolutely right, the figures just don't add up.
We have to tighten our belts.
Eitherthat... or bankruptcy.
Vicent does him better.
Oh, yes, go on, do it for us.
Artur, if you like I could go to Madrid at the end of the month to close the deal.
It would be the answer to our prayers.
Carles...
Carles...
It's so nice to feel dizzy, Carles.
I look at you but I don't see you!
Why don't you give me a kiss?
Touch me, I can't see you!
Vicent!
Get out.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Get out of here!
It should never have happened.
Not like that.
I read your report again last night for a second time.
A quite extravagant option, if you don't mind me saying so.
The hypnosis sessions haven't produced anything.
Whateverthe secret Prats entrusted to his daughter, we're not going to find it in her subconscious.
I'm afraid this is the only alternative.
You've got three days to carry out a new mission.
Nobody's going to hurt her, are they?
Half yourfee is just in front of you.
"Darling daughter, if you hearthese words, it's because I'm no longer here.
Now, as I write these words, it's hard to believe, but I think that after all these years together
I've come to the conclusion that to really love somebody you have to accept that one day we won't be here to give the best of ourselves.
That is when we must make way for someone else.
I've organised it so you'll hear my last words from the lips of Carles,
who was like a son to me.
He'lI look after you and the factory just as I always have.
I love you very much, my dear.
Very much indeed.
No fatherwants his children to get sick.
But your illness has made you special, just as special as your motherwas.
I've suffered a lot for you, you know that, but I want you to know,
I'd never have swapped the daughter you've been forthe daughter you might have been.
You've caused me more pain than anything, but you've also given me more happiness than I everthought I could aspire to in this life.
Your loving father."
Leave me, please.
You must cure her.
Understand?
Now more than ever.
You have to do it.
I promised Mr. Prats I wouldn't rest until I found a cure for his daughter.
And I will keep that promise.
The "Cocoon", remember?
We have to isolate her from all stimuli.
Sounds, images, tactile sensations, temperature, absolutely everything, for a period of three days.
That includes me, the servants and even you.
Any interaction with other people could ruin everything.
You mean lock her up forthree days.
I know it's tough but we can put a stop to these nervous fits.
To block out this confusing universe she is immersed in, she has to be totally isolated.
Begin the preparations immediately.
But whatever happens, we're getting married on the 6th of January.
Without any possible delay.
Without delay.
Aren't you going to eat?
Yes.
Excuse me, I was a little distracted.
I've tried on the tunic.
The doctor says I can't take it off.
I told him that in three days I'll at least have to do number ones.
He just started laughing.
And so did I.
-Are you leaving now?
-Yes.
I have to go.
I'd love to stay here with you, but it's late.
Carles, is it always going to be like this?
Of course not.
Why do you say that?
It's all right.
You go.
The doctor is convinced you will recover.
You'll see, when we are married.
You're so naughty!
Got any spare change, sir?
Do you want to take part orto watch?
Take part orwatch?
Watch.
Don't turn around.
Don't turn around.
I'm not even going to open it.
Leave it inside without making a noise.
-Are you feeling okay?
-Yes, sir.
Quick!
Call Margarita.
Joana?
Joana?
Who's that?
Doctor?
Is that you?
No, Joana, it's me.
Carles.
What?
Put the light on.
You see?
Carles, is something wrong?
No, nothing.
Don't fret.
I just had to see you.
Right now?
Are you crazy?
Let me explain.
Please...
I had to talk to you before the wedding and I thought that here without anybody about...
I've been doing some thinking...
About us... and the factory.
What are you trying to do?
Ruin the treatment?
I know you don't believe in Doctor Meissner, but don't spoil everything, please, even if it's just for daddy.
Please, leave.
I asked you to leave.
Why did you leave the room?
What went wrong?
I don't know.
I don't know, I thought maybe she had cottoned on.
What are you talking about?
Do you think she recognised you?
No, it's not that.
It's as if she could sense I wasn't telling the truth.
-Are you getting cold feet?
-No.
Then go back inside and follow our instructions.
Is everything in order, Doctor?
Yes.
The boy is going back in.
Carles, if you don't leave, I'm going to scream.
-Just for a minute.
-Carles, no.
-You're very sad.
-What do you expect?
Joana...
In all these years, I've never had the courage to tell you... what I really feel for you.
Are you trying to say you don't want to marry me?
Marry you?
There's nothing in this world I'd rather do more.
So you've already got what you wanted, haven't you?
Yes.
I have your hand, because yourfather gave it to me.
But I'd like to have asked you for it myself.
Aren't you going to say anything?
What am I meant to say?
Nothing.
I just wanted you to know.
I won't bother you any more.
Where are you going?
I have to go to the factory.
We've got so much work still to do.
Besides, I don't want to interfere with the treatment.
-One more thing.
-Yes?
I need...
I need yourfinger measurements.
If we wait any longer to orderthe rings, they won't be ready in time.
Would you mind if I came back tomorrow?
No.
Of course not.
Tomorrow.
I'll be here.
Go and find the accounts ledgers saved from the fire and send them on to me at home.
Very well.
The news got to Madrid quick enough.
-Should I go in?
-Not yet, no.
One thing is improvising to get out of a sticky situation, quite another is disobeying instructions.
When you go back in, take up the protocol again from the part about the wedding rings.
The wedding rings, yes.
Carles?
What are you doing?
It's a surprise.
-A surprise?
-Yes.
Close your eyes.
But...
-Close your eyes.
-Okay, okay.
I'm watching you.
Now?
No, just a minute.
Whenever you're ready.
It's my engagement present.
But if you don't like it, I can get you a jewel.
It's the most beautiful present I've ever been given.
They seem real.
How did you do it?
No, don't tell me.
I'd rather not know.
Joana...
What?
Forgive me.
What for?
For having been so distant all these years.
Are you all right?
Is something wrong?
My recollection of you was so different.
Joana, we're not exactly children any more.
The wedding ring.
I had to take your measurements.
Yes, that's right.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I thought you were about to "ask for my hand".
Well, in a way, that's what I am doing.
Don't you see, Carles?
We're doing everything the wrong way round!
You're right.
And it's all my fault.
Don't say that.
You and your dad always did that.
Exactly, it was something between him and I.
Forgive me.
I didn't mean to upset you.
I'm sorry.
I miss him so much.
So do I, Joana.
So do I.
Anything else, sir?
No, thank you, you can go.
Teresa?
-Sir.
-Margarita.
Excuse me.
Where is Doctor Meissner?
Actually, I don't know.
He should be in his bedroom.
Doctor.
Sir.
Can I help you with anything?
What would happen if she had a problem in there?
One of her attacks?
If what's worrying you is the storm, I can assure you her isolation is absolute.
Absolutely everything has been taken care of.
It's okay.
Leave us.
Carry on eating.
I'm not hungry.
It's obvious that you don't lack confidence in yourself.
Listen, in less than twelve hours, we have to return that girl to the world she was living in.
If you carry on playing this passionate version of Carles Lardin, the original by her side might suddenly look like a cheap fake in comparison.
And neither you nor I want that to happen.
For Joana's sake.
What do you want me to do now?
Enough beating about the bush.
When you go back in, ask her directly about the formula.
And this time, keep your enthusiasm under control.
What the hell?
What is it?
-It's the thunder.
She can hear it!
-Hear it?
Listen to me!
I don't care if she can hear it.
What concerns me is that we can't hear her.
Everything's been taken care of.
We paid you to make the cocoon soundproof, you idiot!
In the original cocoon...
not this one.
There's a panic button.
A panic button?
Don't worry.
The button is irrelevant because Joana won't be needing it.
Believe me,
that bell isn't going to ring.
Carles!
I understand you want to see her, you miss her.
All of us worry about Joana.
Me as much as anyone.
Please forgive me,
I'm...
I'm...
Joana!
Joana, Joana.
It's me.
Carles.
I'm here.
Everything the wrong way round.
Don't pull that face, Doctor.
Does it really surprise you?
This is our last day.
We've got to do something.
Of course we're going to do something.
You can't harm her.
We made a deal.
Indeed we did, and then you came up with this ridiculous circus performance.
What happened?
How long have I been asleep?
I don't know.
You were so tired, I didn't want to wake you.
What's that?
Daddy's photograph album.
Look, that's you at Christmas mass.
And how do you know that's me?
I know this book off by heart, and you're always the one who's next to Dad.
Well, almost always.
This will be the first year without him.
But now that Dad isn't here,
I suppose you'll be the crown prince, won't you?
No, I'm just a faithful squire, who will always protect you.
My faithful squire.
I like that.
I don't want you to worry, but I need to tell you something.
It's very important.
Joana?
Get the kid out of there.
He's had too many chances already.
What?
No!
Just a minute.
I said get him out of there now.
Carles?
I can't see you, Carles.
Carles?
Joana,
Joana, I'm not...
You're scaring me.
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
Listen to me.
There's no time.
I haven't found the courage to tell you before now.
-I'm not...
-What?
We can't escape this.
-What are you talking about?
-The thing is...
I'm not...
It's the business.
We're in a critical situation.
Because of the fire?
It's not just that.
We've been operating at a loss for months.
If it continues, we'll have to close Joana Lenses within the year.
But that can't be right.
Daddy never...
Your dad neverwanted you to worry.
Listen, Joana,
I've been thinking about it and I can only see one solution.
Manufacturing the catadioptric lens.
-He didn't want to.
-I wish there were anotherway, but it's our only salvation.
If we don't, we'll go bust.
Please, give me the formula.
What formula?
My dad never gave me any formula.
And all this... was because you wanted that formula?
How can you say that?
Don't you trust me?
Come here.
Come.
Sit down.
Close your eyes.
One.
Four.
Two.
Eight.
Seven.
Seven.
Nine.
Fantastic!
When I was a little girl and I went to the factory with my father, we used to pretend I was helping him in the lab.
He always wrote those numbers on the palm of my hand.
Always the same ones, always in the same order.
I don't know.
Do you think those numbers might be...?
I think so.
Joana,
I'm sorry it all had to be this way.
No, Carles.
I know you're only doing this to protect me.
I trust you.
Yes.
I have to get back to work.
I thought you'd gone to the jeweller already.
Yes, I did.
It's just I didn't want to give it back.
I thought you'd want to keep it until I give you the real one.
See you outside.
In a short while, my faithful squire.
The payment for your services is in your room.
Don't be long.
Doctor?
What will happen to her now?
Don't worry.
She's sleeping peacefully, and she's going to be fine, as fine as she can be.
You can't cure her, can you?
All that stuff about the treatment was lies.
Listen carefully, forthe last time.
Son of a bitch!
Look!
Overthere!
What's all this?
Sir, I...
The police were here, sir.
The police?
What did they want?
-An escaped anarchist!
-They thought he was here.
They took us into the kitchen while they searched the mansion!
That's enough.
Mr. Lardin!
There's a fellow here at the station with a very strange story.
Yes, I know, an anarchist.
What?
No, he's not an anarchist, not as far as I know.
I know this might sound strange, but he's made a statement saying he was forced to take part in a plot to kidnap Joana Prats.
What are you talking about?
That's absurd!
Yes, but you understand it's our duty to check out his story.
Hold on.
You came to my house looking for an anarchist?
No, no.
What are you talking about?
We haven't been near your house.
But, Sir, it's still not time!
Go and find Dr. Meissner!
Joana?
Thank God.
-Are you alright?
-Of course I am!
I was so looking forward to seeing you.
So, three days here on you own.
Yes, "on my own".
Doctor Meissner isn't here yet.
We'll have to wait a while.
Do you know what we could do?
No.
I see you're feeling better.
Do you notice anything different?
Everything is different.
You know what?
I think I've even got over my fear of thunder storms.
Wait a moment.
You heard the thunder?
A little.
It was very distant.
Maybe I heard it because I'm getting better.
Maybe.
Excuse me, sir.
Good morning.
I hate to interrupt...
It's okay, darling.
Go about your business.
I'll see you later.
Marga, can you bring some more butter, please?
Yes, Ma'am.
The entrance was here.
And her bed was there.
And they controlled it all from up there.
They?
That's enough.
Let's get out of here.
Come in.
Sir, I don't mean to disturb you...
-What time is it?
-It's seven o'clock.
Madam has already had dinner.
Would you like to have some?
No.
Maybe later.
Has Doctor Meissner called?
-Shall I call the police?
-No, not forthe time being.
Thank you.
I think Marga almost saw me.
Joana!
What are you doing?
-I couldn't stand it anymore.
-What is it?
I had to see you.
Joana, the servants!
We'll be very quiet.
Be careful.
Careful.
Just take it slowly.
Joana, please, the books.
I was so scared that it was alljust a dream, these last three days.
I thought I wouldn't be able to stand being locked up, but when I saw you come in the door,
I was simply dying for you to walk in.
-You really mean that?
-Yes.
Carles...
Oh, Carles...
What is it, Joana?
Who are you?
Joana, it's me, darling.
It's me.
Last night, you seemed like someone else.
Last night?
Well?
I know it isn't pleasant.
It's a load of rubbish.
However, this man seems to have a lot of information on you.
From having worked in my house.
Well, that's what he claims.
You don't give this any credibility?
Absolutely none whatsoever.
In any case, it's easy to check whether he everworked in my house.
Is Joana all right?
How could you do something like that?
They didn't give me much choice.
They knew everything about you.
Everything except that damn formula.
That formula doesn't exist.
Joana gave it to me.
They wanted to torture her.
I did it to save her.
Save her?
You?
-She doesn't even know you exist.
-Ask her about that.
-What are you saying?
-You don't deserve her.
You don't respect her as a woman.
You can't give her what she wants.
One day, she'lI work out that you're not the man she was with.
And by then I won't be in here.
There's no proof against me.
If you want to accuse me of something,
you'll have to let Joana explain what happened between us to the whole world.
If you go anywhere near her again,
I swear to God I'll kill you!
I'll kill you.
Everything alright?
Out, out.
How could you?
How could something like this happen?
It makes my head spin.
Did you know that good-for-nothing worked in this house?
Vicent!
The servant we dismissed!
I see you remember the bastard well enough.
Carles, I swearto God that I thought it was you!
I swear.
Well, I'm afraid that's not the way it was.
Carles, wait.
I wanted it to be you with all my heart.
Mister Lardin.
Bitch.
I'm with guests.
If you have something you'd like to say to me...
You... and Meissner and that servant... have taken everything from me.
I have nothing left.
Mister Lardin,
get married, sell the business, and stop worrying,
I never leave loose ends.
Happy Christmas, sir.
Mister Lardin, Mister Lardin...
Happy Christmas.
We are very sad about the loss of Mr. Prats.
Joana.
Joana!
It's you!
Stop or I'll shoot!
Joana!
No!
Joana, Joana...
Are you okay?
It's me.
Is it you?
Oh, my God.
Fetch a doctor!
Somebody find a doctor!
What is it?
What do you want?
Leave me.
Joana.
Joana?
Joana.
I'm here.
-Carles?
-No.
No, Joana, it's me.
My faithful squire.
- Good morning, officer.
- Can you turn the music down?
Oh, okay.
Down means off.
You know why I pulled you over this morning?
Well, I'm pretty sure I wasn't speeding.
I've been using the cruise control, so I don't...
No, sir, your windshield.
License and registration, please.
Right.
This...
This was from Wayfarer 515.
- My house was in the debris field.
- Okay.
And that's what shattered my windshield some piece of wreckage from the plane.
I understand.
You know of flight 515, the plane crash?
You're wearing the ribbon.
Yes, sir.
I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515.
I was one of the first responders on the scene.
- Then what are you doing?
- Citing you, sir.
What?
What, you don't believe me?
Regardless of how that windshield was damaged this car is unsafe to drive in this condition.
Stay in the car, please.
Wait.
Wait just a minute.
Just one minute.
- I asked you to stay in the vehicle.
- I can get out of my own car.
- Sir, listen...
- No, you listen to me.
It's time for you to listen to me.
- Take a deep breath, calm down.
- This is America, okay?
- Get back in that car.
- I have rights.
You understand that?
At least have the common decency to hear me out.
- Step back now.
- Did you even hear what I said?
- Sir, calm down.
- You're giving me a ticket?
I told you that my house was in the debris field.
Do you have the remotest inkling of what that means?
- Sir, calm down.
- Hellfire rained down on my house where my children sleep!
- I need you to step back now.
- There were body parts in my yard!
- Are you kidding me?
!
- Sir, last warning.
- You got two seconds to stand down.
- Or?
- I'm gonna pepper-spray you.
- Pepper-spray me.
That is just perfect.
Pepper-spray the man who's expressing his opinion under the First Amendment!
Lastly a little something from down El Paso way.
Border Patrol came across multiple homicides just this side of the border.
Truck turns out to be a chicken run out of Juarez into Laredo.
Border Patrol's been playing hide-and-seek with these polleros for two years.
But this time, soon as they made it across, someone hit them.
Hit them hard.
We're talking a driver and nine illegals.
No sign of the shooters.
So this truck was carrying more than just people.
What are we looking at, weed, coke or meth?
No, doesn't look like they were transporting narcotics.
Why'd the Border Patrol kick this to us?
They didn't.
I pulled it.
You ask me, this is high-end cartel work.
Los Zetas, maybe.
Question is, why do we have Juarez-style action on our side of the DMZ?
They sending a message?
Clearing a path?
Or was this about stopping one particular border-hopper?
Maybe one of those... extra-crispies knew something he shouldn't.
Anyway, keep your eyes open.
All right, that's it.
Slow news day.
Add one more to the countdown.
Oh, yeah?
What's that, Gomey?
We're waiting on that famous blue meth of yours.
Twenty-nine days since we saw it last.
It's still out there, Gomey.
Don't worry.
Local P.D. I gotta take this.
Gomey, go beat your piñata.
Rest of you jokers, too damn quiet in here.
Catch some bad guys.
Schrader.
Hey, what's up, Walt?
What?
Jesse?
Hey, Dad.
- Fixing up the house, huh?
- Doing a little work, yeah.
Well, I'll bounce.
It's cool.
You doing okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.
I just happened to be driving by and saw the sign.
So you're selling the place.
In this market.
Can you believe it?
I see you moved the garage.
That's bold.
Your mother's idea.
It's quite an operation.
We did all new stucco, all new master suite sandblasted, fumigated the basement.
Right on.
Yeah.
You know, fixing up the place totally increases resale value.
I read that in, I wanna say, like TIME magazine.
So, what'd you do with the upstairs bathroom?
All redone.
New tiles in the bathrooms and kitchens granite countertops, new appliances.
All top-of-the line.
Damn.
That's great, Dad.
Think I can get a tour?
These guys are trying to finish up.
Maybe we'd better stay out of their way.
There are pictures on the website, if you want to take a look.
Cool.
You're looking healthy.
I'll tell your mother.
She'll be happy.
Thanks.
You know, I could come by sometime for dinner or something.
Yeah.
Sometime.
Okay.
Later, Dad.
You know, look, he's a high-school teacher.
He's never been in trouble a day in his life.
He finds out he's got lung cancer and now his wife kicks the poor bastard out of his own house.
I mean, look, guys, if anybody rates a little slack, here's the guy.
Hey, Walt.
Remember Officer Cavanaugh?
Officer, I'm very sorry that I lost my temper.
There's no excuse for my behaviour.
It was disrespectful.
Yeah.
Thanks, man.
She's divorcing me.
I don't know what to tell you, buddy.
It is what it is.
She doesn't want me to see the kids.
She said that?
Yeah.
You don't write, you don't call.
God.
It's a disaster.
- It is not a disaster.
- Oh, okay.
It's not a disaster, all right?
She's not going to the cops, she's not gonna tell a living soul.
You wanna know why?
One word:
Blowback.
If she blabs, it'll be a disaster, for her.
That DEA brother-in-law?
Screwed.
You were right under his nose.
He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue-sniffers at the hobby shop.
The kids?
Paging Dr. Phil.
My daddy's a drug dealer and my mommy turned him in.
And the house?
Gone.
Feds would RICO her and the kids out on the street.
Good luck arguing with them on that.
No.
It's not gonna happen.
She's bluffing and she knows it.
Her going to the police is not the point, Saul.
She's out of my life.
Do you understand?
I've lost my family.
Everything that I care about.
Hey, buddy.
- It's bad.
It's a calamity.
- Oh, my God.
But we live to fight another day.
And after a decent interval of time well, there are other fish in the sea.
You've been out of circulation for a while.
You'll be just amazed at what's out there.
Thailand, the Czech Republic.
I mean, those women are so grateful to even be here.
In the meantime, idle hands are the devil's plaything.
So why don't you get back on the horse and do what you do best?
First step:
Talk to our friend and get cooking.
I can't be the bad guy.
What?
I can't be the bad guy.
Okay.
You know, we'll revisit.
Just promise me you won't hang yourself in the closet.
Pop-pop!
Pop-pop, the ice cream man!
- Don't tell your mom.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
- It's me.
We may have a wife problem.
Look, I need eyes on it.
You got an address?
Hey.
Dinner's gonna be late.
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie are bringing takeout but if you're hungry, I could rustle something up.
Hey, buddy, pass the ketchup, will you?
What?
I've had enough trans-fat for one lifetime.
Two-day drive from the nearest ocean and you're... eating raw fish.
That's all I'm saying.
Been awhile since that minnow's been swimming.
Right, buddy?
Yeah.
You know, Flynn here is looking for a part-time job so, I don't know, if you know of anything you might want to...
My name's Walter Jr.
Like, what, you can't even say his name?
If you've changed your mind about being called Flynn all you need to do is just tell me that you don't want to be called Flynn.
Dad didn't even show up till fourth period.
And his eyes were all red, like he's been crying or something.
But you, you don't even care!
And now he won't even drive me home.
He won't say why, but I know it's because you told him not to.
- Honey, I...
- What?
I don't know what your problem is.
You may not love him anymore, but I do.
I mean, why you gotta be...?
Why you gotta be such a bitch?
!
- Hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no.
- Oh, God.
- You can't talk to your mom like that.
- Hank, no.
Hank.
Hank, it's...
It's all right.
Hey, hey.
Skyler, I know that you must have your reasons for all of this.
Sky, the...
I know it's none of my business but keeping Walt from the kids?
I mean...
You're right, Hank.
It's none of your business.
Oh, my God.
After all of that?
Please, tell me that you are still not curious.
- There's nothing to be curious about.
- Oh, please.
The day I heard the words "second cell phone".
I knew.
- Believe me.
Seen it a hundred times.
- Okay.
All right.
So, what?
Stop dancing around it.
What is it exactly that you have seen a hundred times?
Please, pleasee... enlighten me.
Look, a guy like Walt?
Nice guy, decent, smart.
But, let's face it, underachiever, dead-end life, okay?
He gets cancer.
Time's running out.
Mid-life crisis.
He acts up.
He steps out.
And the wife, she catches him.
I mean, it's a story as old as time.
Look, do the math, Marie.
It only comes out one way.
Knowing Walt, he felt so guilty, he probably told her himself.
I...
I don't know.
I think if he cheated on her, that she would have told me by now.
It just feels like something more.
Yes, yes, yes, 24l7 coverage.
Need you ask?
How much is this gonna run me?
Jesus, I'm in the wrong business.
Yeah, I'll call you.
Return of the prodigal, back to the land of the living.
- How you feeling?
- I'm good.
Of course you are.
The world's your oyster.
Am I right?
Unencumbered young man with stacks of cash.
Hey, I'm jealous.
Hand to God, I'm jealous.
Speaking of cash, you know what's giving me heartburn lately?
Your former partner.
This guy, he works like a bastard, right?
Builds a business single-handed.
Finally the big money shows up and what does he do?
He walks out.
Talent like that and he flushes it down the crapper.
It's like Michelangelo won't paint.
Look, I know you're out of it and all but you wouldn't talk to him, would you?
Help him pull his head out of his ass?
All right, all right, scratch that.
Yeah, he won't listen to me, he's not gonna listen to you.
All due respect.
You want a job?
A job?
- Who's got a job for me?
- I do.
There you go.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Thought I'd well, visit, if you don't mind.
- Of course not.
- You don't need the room, do you?
- No, no, no.
I just needed some more space to spread out.
Wanted to say hello to little Holly.
Hey, girl.
Hi, baby.
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
Oh, yeah.
She's a beauty.
Look at her.
Hey, thanks for being so flexible on me coming in.
I just wish we had you back full-time.
You do brighten up the place.
Listen, believe me, this is...
I don't want to bring this up, but I can't sign off on these quarterlies.
I'm sorry, I just can't.
Is that right?
If you're gonna do this, it can't be so glaring.
Glaring.
Okay.
That does sound bad.
Show me what's bothering you.
Keller.
Again.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I know how you feel about this.
Revenue with no backup.
Here, here and here.
I don't even know what to say.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, okay.
This is fixable, right?
How about if I just push 28,800 out of this into next quarter?
Would you sign it then?
I'm just saying I can't sign it as it currently exists.
Fair enough.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you for the heads-up.
You won't have to deal with this again, I swear.
What if your kids found out?
- Lf my kids found out?
- This.
What you're doing.
Someday they're gonna be old enough.
How would you explain it to them?
Well, put me on the spot, why don't you?
I guess maybe I'd...
I'd say that I might have feet of clay but that whatever I did, I did thinking of them.
You know, trying to provide.
And I'd ask them to try to take the time to understand...
You know what?
Truth is, I haven't thought that far ahead, Skyler.
I'm just trying to keep my head above water, so...
I'd better get back to it.
Oh, God.
Hi, Walt.
Listen, I can't tal...
I'm at work right now...
What?
Louis dropped him off.
He was here when I got home.
No, no, no, of course.
No, he's not staying.
He understands that.
- I'll bring him anywhere you want.
- Dad.
Well, yeah.
It is rush hour.
I mean, I could fight traffic and bring him down to Beneke now.
But wouldn't it be... easier if we...?
Right, okay, good.
So we'll meet you at the house.
Okay, bye.
Why are you doing this?
She's just trying to keep me from seeing you and you're helping her.
Well, son, I mean, your mother, she has her reasons.
What reasons?
They're...
Well, they're...
Well, they're just a little difficult to delineate.
But, I mean, yes, there are two sides to every story, always.
But she...
Yeah.
This is just how it has to be for now, okay?
Now, look, your home is your home and that is where you belong, all right?
But it's where you belong.
Dad, it's your house.
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie everybody knows that you haven't done anything wrong.
Everybody is on your side.
Well, it's not about taking sides, though.
- How can you let her treat you like this?
- Come on.
- How can you just take it?
- Now just listen to me, okay?
No matter what, all of this has nothing to do with how we feel about you, okay?
We both love you very, very much, okay?
You and your sister will come first always.
Come on.
Let's try to see this in a positive light, okay?
Both of us.
Let's just buck up.
And I'll take you home.
Let me first just hit the old bathroom here.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
- Nice to meet you.
Saul Goodman.
- Nice to meet you.
You're not that lawyer on late-night television, are you?
Better call Saul!
I get it all the time.
We're here to discuss the sale of the property at 9809 Margo.
I get it.
Flat-fee clients, am I right?
Well, folks, today's your lucky day.
I represent a client who shall remain nameless.
However, for our purposes you might just as well visualise a large bag of money.
This individual wants to buy your house today for cash.
- Cash?
- Cash.
I know, in this economy.
The money is already burning a hole in my client's account.
You can ask Mr. Gardiner.
I've shown him all the pertinent financials.
It's the only reason we're sitting here.
Fair enough.
We get a few papers signed and notarised we can take care of this right now.
In fact, I could wire you your money this very afternoon.
There's just one little hair in the soup.
The price.
We feel 875 is very fair.
But I suppose there's always a little wiggle room.
Well, why don't you wiggle us on down to 400 and you got yourselves a deal?
Four hundred thousand?
What is that, a joke?
No, that's my offer.
That's less than half-price.
We put that much into the renovations alone.
Why don't we just cut the clown act and you tell us what you're willing to come up to?
Four hundred thousand.
That's my final offer.
- Waste of time.
- Ridiculous.
How could you possibly imagine we'd entertain this?
- Come on, hon.
- I don't know.
I thought some allowance was in order once I heard about the meth lab.
That used to be in the basement.
I looked over your signed disclosure statements and I don't see any mention of a meth lab.
Nope.
Oh, you got your termite inspection.
That's good.
But no meth lab.
Now, some would call that fraud in service of concealing a felony.
I, myself, am more open-minded.
But it is tricky.
Now, don't get me wrong.
I applaud your cojones.
I mean, good try at sneaking a meth-contaminated property past a buyer.
I mean, could've been a good deal for you.
Too bad.
Now, I could file a suit and encumber this property indefinitely.
Or I could start some criminal proceedings.
But I don't think any of us want that, now, do we?
How about it, counsellor?
Do you concur?
There you go, son.
Come on.
It's not Devil's Island.
Okay.
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.
- Brought pizza.
- Yeah.
Well, I'm making dinner.
Okay, I'll just put it in the fridge.
It's even better the next day.
Hi, honey.
Sorry.
Skyler.
I mean, what kind of example do we want to set here, right?
I mean, can't we at least just sit down and eat a piece of pizza together?
Just hash things out like adults?
We have discussed everything we need to discuss.
I thought I made myself very clear.
I got dipping sticks.
You've reached Walt's temporary number.
Please, leave a message.
When I went out this morning to get the newspaper I saw a pizza on our roof.
Would you know anything about that?
Listen to me, Walt.
You need to control yourself.
Calm down, accept the situation and k eep your distance.
If you can't manage that, I will get a restraining order.
Skyler.
Skyler.
Got your restraining order right here!
Restrain this!
Breaking even is not so bad.
In this economy, a lot of people would kill to break even.
Poor Jake.
He had his heart set on going to Space Camp.
Oh, no.
Oh, God.
This is all we need.
Hey, Mom, Dad.
How's it going?
Jesse, it's really not a good time.
Come on.
Jesse, the house has been sold.
The new owners are... expected at any moment.
- Where do you think you're going?
- Inside.
I bought the place.
Be back by seven, okay?
Love you.
Bye.
No!
Oh, God.
It's me.
There's something he should know about.
Hold on.
- Good morning, Officer.
- Sir, can you turn the music down?
Down means off.
You know why I pulled you over this morning?
Well...
I'm pretty sure I wasn't speeding.
I've been using the cruise control, so I...
No, sir.
Your windshield.
License and registration, please.
Right.
This was from Wayfarer 515.
My house was in the debris field.
And that's what shattered my windshield... some piece of wreckage from the plane.
I understand.
You know of Flight 515, the plane crash?
You're wearing the ribbon.
Yes, sir.
I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515.
I was one of the first responders on the scene that day.
Then what are you doing?
Citing you, sir.
{What, }You don't believe me?
Regardless of how that windshield was damaged, this car is unsafe to drive in this condition.
Stay in the car, please.
{Wait. }Wait just a minute.
Just one minute.
{Sir, }I asked you to stay in the vehicle.
- I can get out of my own car.
- Sir, listen...
No.
You listen to me.
It's time for you to listen to me.
{Sir, what you need to do is take a deep breath, calm down.
And get back in that car now.}Calm down and get back in that car.
This is America.
I have rights.
Do you understand that?
At least have the common decency to hear me out.
- {I need you to }Step back right now.
- Did you even hear what I said?
Now you're giving me a ticket?
I told you that my house was in the debris field.
Do you have the remotest inkling of what that means?
- Sir, calm down.
- Hellfire rained down on my house
{Sir, I need you to step back now.}where my children sleep!
There were body parts in my yard!
- Sir, this is your last warning.
- You gotta be kidding me!
{You got about two seconds to stand down, or }I'm gonna pepper spray you.
You're gonna pepper spray?
Perfect!
That is just perfect!
Pepper spray the man who's expressing his opinion under the First Amendment!

Border Patrol came across multiple homicides just this side of the border.
Truck turn out to be a chicken run out of Juarez and Laredo.
Border Patrol's been playing hide-and-seek with these polleros for two years.
{pos(192,220)}But this time, as soon as they made it across,
{pos(192,220)}someone hit them.
{pos(192,220)}Hit them hard.
{pos(192,220)}We're talking a driver and nine illegals.
{pos(192,220)}No sign of the shooters.
{pos(192,220)}This truck was carrying more than just people.
{pos(192,220)}What are we looking at?
Weed, coke, or meth?
{pos(192,220)}Doesn't look like they were transporting narcotics.
{pos(192,220)}Why did the Border Patrol kick this to us?
{pos(192,220)}They didn't.
I pulled it.
{pos(192,220)}You ask me, this high-end cartel work.
{pos(192,220)}Los Zetas, maybe.
{pos(192,220)}Question is, why do we have Juarez-style action
{pos(192,220)}on our side of the DMZ?
{pos(192,220)}They sending a message or clearing a path?
{pos(192,220)}Or was this about stopping one particular border-hopper?
{pos(192,220)}Maybe one of those extra-crispies knew something he shouldn't.
{pos(192,220)}Anyway, keep your eyes open.
{pos(192,220)}All right.
That's it.
Slow news day.
{pos(192,220)}Add one more to the countdown.
What's that, Gomie?
We're waiting on that famous blue meth of yours.
{pos(192,220)}29 days since we saw it last.
{pos(192,220)}It's still out there.
Don't worry.
Local PD.
I gotta take this.
{pos(192,205)}Gomie, go beat your pinata.
{pos(192,205)}Rest of you jokers...
too damn quiet in here.
{pos(192,220)}Go catch some bad guys.
What's up, Paul?
{pos(192,205)}Hey, Dad.
- So you're fixing up the house?
- Doing a little work, yeah.
I'll bounce.
It's cool.
You doing okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
I just happened to be driving by
{pos(192,205)}and saw the sign.
{pos(192,205)}So, you're selling the place.
In this market.
Can you believe it?
{pos(192,205)}I see you moved the garage.
That's bold.
{pos(192,205)}Your mother's idea.
It's quite an operation.
{pos(192,205)}We did, all new stucco, all the master suite,
{pos(192,205)}sandblasted, fumigated the basement...
{pos(192,205)}Right on.
{pos(192,180)}Fixing up the place totally increases resale value.
{pos(192,205)}I read that in...
I want to say, like,
{pos(192,205)}Time magazine.
{pos(192,205)}So, what'd you do with the upstairs bathroom?
{pos(192,205)}All redone.
New tiles in the bathrooms and kitchens,
{pos(192,205)}granite countertops, new appliances...
all top of the line.
{pos(192,205)}Damn.
That's great, Dad.
Think...
I can get a tour?
{pos(192,205)}These guys are trying to finish up.
{pos(192,205)}Maybe we'd better stay out of their way.
There are pictures on the Web site, if you wanna take a look.
{pos(192,205)}You're looking healthy.
I'll tell your mother.
She'll be happy.
{pos(192,205)}Thanks.
You know, I could come by
{pos(192,205)}sometime for... dinner or something.
Sometime.
Later, Dad.
You know, look, he's a high school teacher over at Wynne.
Never been in trouble a day of his life.
Found out he's got lung cancer, and now his wife kicks the poor bastard out of his own house.
I mean, look, guys, if anybody rates a little slack, here's the guy.
{pos(192,205)}You remember Officer Cavanaugh?
Officer, I'm very sorry that I lost my temper.
There's no excuse for my behavior.
It was disrespectful.
She's divorcing me.
I don't know what to tell you, buddy.
It is what it is.
She doesn't want me to see the kids.
She said that?
You don't write?
You don't call?
It's a disaster.
It is not a disaster.
It's not a disaster, all right?
She's not going to the cops.
She's not gonna tell a living soul.
You wanna know why?
One word:
"blowback".
If she blabs, it'll be a disaster... for her.
That DEA brother-in-law?
Screwed.
You were right under his nose.
He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue-sniffers at the hobby shop.
The kids...
Paging Dr. Phil.
My daddy's a drug dealer, and my mommy turned him in.
And the house... gone.
The feds will come and RICO her and the kids out on the street.
Good luck arguing with them on that.
No.
It's not gonna happen.
She's bluffing, and she knows it.
Her going to the police is not the point, Saul.
She's out of my life.

Well, they're just a little difficult to delineate, but...
I mean, yes, there are two sides to every story.
Always.
But... she...
This is just how it has to be.
For now.
And, look, your home is your home, and that is where you belong, okay?
But it's where you belong.
Dad, it's your house.
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie... everybody knows that you haven't done anything wrong.
Everybody is on your side.
It's not about taking sides, though.
How can you let her treat you like this?
Now, come on.
- How can you just... just take it?
- Just listen to me, okay?
No matter what, all of this has nothing to do with how we feel about you, okay?
We both love you very, very much, okay?
You and your sister will come first, always.
Now, come on.
Let's try to see this in a positive light, okay?
Both of us.
Let's just buck up.
Then I'll take you home.
Let me first just hit the old bathroom here.
Good afternoon.
Nice to meet you.
Saul Goodman.
Nice to meet you.
You're not that lawyer on late-night television, are you?
Better call Saul!
I get it all the time.
We're here to discuss the sale of the property at 9809 Margo.
I get it.
Flat-fee clients.
Am I right?
Well, folks, today's your lucky day.
I represent a client who shall remain nameless.
However, for our purposes, you might just as well visualize a large bag of money.
This individual wants to buy your house today, for cash.
- Cash?
- Cash.
I know.
In this economy.
In fact, the money is already burning a hole in my client's account.
You can ask Mr. Gardiner.
I've shown him all the pertinent financials.
It's the only reason we're sitting here.
Fair enough.
We... get a few papers signed and notarized, we can take care of this right now.
In fact, I can wire you your money this very afternoon.
There's just one little hair in the soup... the price.
We feel 875 is very fair.
But I suppose there's always a little...
wiggle room.
You wiggle us on down to 400 and you got yourselves a deal.
400,000?
What is that, a joke?
No, that's my offer.
That's less than half price.
We put almost that much into the renovations alone.
Why don't we just cut the clown act and you tell us what you're willing to come up to?
400,000.
That's my final offer.
This is a waste of time.{ Ridiculous.}
How could you possibly imagine that we would entertain this?
{ Come on, hon.}
{I don't know. }I {just }thought some allowance was in order once I heard about the meth lab... {The one }that used to be in the basement.
I looked over your signed disclosure statements, and I don't see any mention of a meth lab.
You got your termite inspection.
That's good.
But no ... meth lab.
Now, some would call that fraud in service of concealing a felony.
I, myself, am more open-minded.
But it is tricky.
Don't get me wrong.
I applaud your cojones.
I mean, good try in sneaking a meth-contaminated property past the buyer.
{I mean, you know,}Could've been a good deal for you.
Too bad.
Now, I could... file a suit and encumber this property indefinitely, or I could start some criminal proceedings.
But I don't think any of us want that now, do we?
How about it, counselor?
Do you concur?
Here you go{, son}.
Come on.
It's not Devil's Island.
- Brought pizza.
- Well, I'm making dinner.
I'll just... put it in the fridge.
It's even better the next day.
Hi, honey.
Sorry.
Honey, what...
What kind of example do we want to set here?
Right?
I mean, can't we at least just sit down and eat a piece of pizza together?
Just to hash things out like adults?
We have... discussed everything we need to discuss.
I thought I made myself very clear.
I got dipping sticks.
You've reached Walt's temporary number.
Please leave a message.
When I went out this morning to get the newspaper,
I saw a pizza on our roof.
Would you know anything about that?
Listen to me, Walt.
You need to control yourself.
Calm down, accept the situation, and keep your distance.
If you can't manage that,
I will get a restraining order.
I got your restraining order right here!
Restrain this!
Breaking even's not so bad.
In this economy, a lot of people would kill to break even.
Poor Jake.
He had his heart set on going to space camp.
Oh, God, this is all we need.
Hey, Mom, Dad.
How's it going?
It's really not a good time.
Jesse, the house has been sold.
The new owners are expected at any moment.
- Where do you think you're going?
- Inside.
I bought the place.
Be back by 7, okay?
I love you.
Bye.
It's me.
There's something you should know about.
Hold on.
- Good morning, officer.
- Can you turn the music down?
Oh, okay.
Down means off.
You know why I pulled you over this morning?
Well, I'm pretty sure I wasn't speeding.
I've been using the cruise control, so I don't...
No, sir, your windshield.
License and registration, please.
Right.
This...
This was from Wayfarer 515.
- My house was in the debris field.
- Okay.
And that's what shattered my windshield some piece of wreckage from the plane.
I understand.
You know of flight 515, the plane crash?
You're wearing the ribbon.
Yes, sir.
I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515.
I was one of the first responders on the scene.
- Then what are you doing?
- Citing you, sir.
What?
What, you don't believe me?
Regardless of how that windshield was damaged this car is unsafe to drive in this condition.
Stay in the car, please.
Wait.
Wait just a minute.
Just one minute.
- I asked you to stay in the vehicle.
- I can get out of my own car.
- Sir, listen...
- No, you listen to me.
It's time for you to listen to me.
- Take a deep breath, calm down.
- This is America, okay?
- Get back in that car.
- I have rights.
You understand that?
At least have the common decency to hear me out.
- Step back now.
- Did you even hear what I said?
- Sir, calm down.
- You're giving me a ticket?
I told you that my house was in the debris field.
Do you have the remotest inkling of what that means?
- Sir, calm down.
- Hellfire rained down on my house where my children sleep!
- I need you to step back now.
- There were body parts in my yard!
- Are you kidding me?
!
- Sir, last warning.
- You got two seconds to stand down.
- Or?
- I'm gonna pepper-spray you.
- Pepper-spray me.
That is just perfect.
Pepper-spray the man who's expressing his opinion under the First Amendment!
Lastly a little something from down El Paso way.
Border Patrol came across multiple homicides just this side of the border.
Truck turns out to be a chicken run out of Juarez into Laredo.
Border Patrol's been playing hide-and-seek with these polleros for two years.
But this time, soon as they made it across, someone hit them.
Hit them hard.
We're talking a driver and nine illegals.
No sign of the shooters.
So this truck was carrying more than just people.
What are we looking at, weed, coke or meth?
No, doesn't look like they were transporting narcotics.
Why'd the Border Patrol kick this to us?
They didn't.
I pulled it.
You ask me, this is high-end cartel work.
Los Zetas, maybe.
Question is, why do we have Juarez-style action on our side of the DMZ?
They sending a message?
Clearing a path?
Or was this about stopping one particular border-hopper?
Maybe one of those extra-crispies knew something he shouldn't.
Anyway, keep your eyes open.
All right, that's it.
Slow news day.
Add one more to the countdown.
Oh, yeah?
What's that, Gomey?
We're waiting on that famous blue meth of yours.
Twenty-nine days since we saw it last.
It's still out there, Gomey.
Don't worry.
Local P.D. I gotta take this.
Gomey, go beat your piñata.
Rest of you jokers, too damn quiet in here.
Catch some bad guys.
Schrader.
Hey, what's up, Walt?
What?
Jesse?
Hey, Dad.
- Fixing up the house, huh?
- Doing a little work, yeah.
Well, I'll bounce.
It's cool.
You doing okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.
I just happened to be driving by and saw the sign.
So you're selling the place.
In this market.
Can you believe it?
I see you moved the garage.
That's bold.
Your mother's idea.
It's quite an operation.
We did all new stucco, all new master suite sandblasted, fumigated the basement.
Right on.
Yeah.
You know, fixing up the place totally increases resale value.
I read that in, I wanna say, like TIME magazine.
So, what'd you do with the upstairs bathroom?
All redone.
New tiles in the bathrooms and kitchens granite countertops, new appliances.
All top-of-the line.
Damn.
That's great, Dad.
Think I can get a tour?
These guys are trying to finish up.
Maybe we'd better stay out of their way.
There are pictures on the website, if you want to take a look.
Cool.
You're looking healthy.
I'll tell your mother.
She'll be happy.
Thanks.
You know, I could come by sometime for dinner or something.
Yeah.
Sometime.
Okay.
Later, Dad.
You know, look, he's a high-school teacher.
He's never been in trouble a day in his life.
He finds out he's got lung cancer and now his wife kicks the poor bastard out of his own house.
I mean, look, guys, if anybody rates a little slack, here's the guy.
Hey, Walt.
Remember Officer Cavanaugh?
Officer, I'm very sorry that I lost my temper.
There's no excuse for my behavior.
It was disrespectful.
Yeah.
Thanks, man.
She's divorcing me.
I don't know what to tell you, buddy.
It is what it is.
She doesn't want me to see the kids.
She said that?
Yeah.
You don't write, you don't call.
God.
It's a disaster.
- It is not a disaster.
- Oh, okay.
It's not a disaster, all right?
She's not going to the cops, she's not gonna tell a living soul.
You wanna know why?
One word:
Blowback.
If she blabs, it'll be a disaster, for her.
That DEA brother-in-law?
Screwed.
You were right under his nose.
He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue-sniffers at the hobby shop.
The kids?
Paging Dr. Phil.
My daddy's a drug dealer and my mommy turned him in.
And the house?
Gone.
Feds would RICO her and the kids out on the street.
Good luck arguing with them on that.
No.
It's not gonna happen.
She's bluffing and she knows it.
Her going to the police is not the point, Saul.
She's out of my life.
Do you understand?
I've lost my family.
Everything that I care about.
Hey, buddy.
- It's bad.
It's a calamity.
- Oh, my God.
But we live to fight another day.
And after a decent interval of time well, there are other fish in the sea.
You've been out of circulation for a while.
You'll be just amazed at what's out there.
Thailand, the Czech Republic.
I mean, those women are so grateful to even be here.
In the meantime, idle hands are the devil's plaything.
So why don't you get back on the horse and do what you do best?
First step:
Talk to our friend and get cooking.
I can't be the bad guy.
What?
I can't be the bad guy.
Okay.
You know, we'll revisit.
Just promise me you won't hang yourself in the closet.
Pop-pop!
Pop-pop, the ice cream man!
- Don't tell your mom.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
- It's me.
We may have a wife problem.
Look, I need eyes on it.
You got an address?
Hey.
Dinner's gonna be late.
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie are bringing takeout but if you're hungry, I could rustle something up.
Hey, buddy, pass the ketchup, will you?
What?
I've had enough trans-fat for one lifetime.
Two-day drive from the nearest ocean and you're eating raw fish.
That's all I'm saying.
Been awhile since that minnow's been swimming.
Right, buddy?
Yeah.
You know, Flynn here is looking for a part-time job so, I don't know, if you know of anything you might want to...
My name's Walter Jr.
Like, what, you can't even say his name?
If you've changed your mind about being called Flynn all you need to do is just tell me that you don't want to be called Flynn.
Dad didn't even show up till fourth period.
And his eyes were all red, like he's been crying or something.
But you, you don't even care!
And now he won't even drive me home.
He won't say why, but I know it's because you told him not to.
- Honey, I...
- What?
I don't know what your problem is.
You may not love him anymore, but I do.
I mean, why you gotta be...?
Why you gotta be such a bitch?
!
- Hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no.
- Oh, God.
- You can't talk to your mom like that.
- Hank, no.
Hank.
Hank, it's...
It's all right.
Hey, hey.
Skyler, I know that you must have your reasons for all of this.
Sky, the...
I know it's none of my business but keeping Walt from the kids?
I mean...
You're right, Hank.
It's none of your business.
Oh, my God.
After all of that?
Please, tell me that you are still not curious.
- There's nothing to be curious about.
- Oh, please.
The day I heard the words "second cell phone," I knew.
- Believe me.
Seen it a hundred times.
- Okay.
All right.
So, what?
Stop dancing around it.
What is it exactly that you have seen a hundred times?
Please, please, enlighten me.
Look, a guy like Walt?
Nice guy, decent, smart.
But, let's face it, underachiever, dead-end life, okay?
He gets cancer.
Time's running out.
Mid-life crisis.
He acts up.
He steps out.
And the wife, she catches him.
I mean, it's a story as old as time.
Look, do the math, Marie.
It only comes out one way.
Knowing Walt, he felt so guilty, he probably told her himself.
I...
I don't know.
I think if he cheated on her, that she would have told me by now.
It just feels like something more.
Yes, yes, yes, 24/7 coverage.
Need you ask?
How much is this gonna run me?
Jesus, I'm in the wrong business.
Yeah, I'll call you.
Return of the prodigal, back to the land of the living.
- How you feeling?
- I'm good.
Of course you are.
The world's your oyster.
Am I right?
Unencumbered young man with stacks of cash.
Hey, I'm jealous.
Hand to God, I'm jealous.
Speaking of cash, you know what's giving me heartburn lately?
Your former partner.
This guy, he works like a bastard, right?
Builds a business single-handed.
Finally the big money shows up and what does he do?
He walks out.
Talent like that and he flushes it down the crapper.
It's like Michelangelo won't paint.
Look, I know you're out of it and all but you wouldn't talk to him, would you?
Help him pull his head out of his ass?
All right, all right, scratch that.
Yeah, he won't listen to me, he's not gonna listen to you.
All due respect.
You want a job?
A job?
- Who's got a job for me?
- I do.
There you go.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Thought I'd well, visit, if you don't mind.
- Of course not.
- You don't need the room, do you?
- No, no, no.
I just needed some more space to spread out.
Wanted to say hello to little Holly.
Hey, girl.
Hi, baby.
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
Oh, yeah.
She's a beauty.
Look at her.
Hey, thanks for being so flexible on me coming in.
I just wish we had you back full-time.
You do brighten up the place.
Listen, believe me, this is...
I don't want to bring this up, but I can't sign off on these quarterlies.
I'm sorry, I just can't.
Is that right?
If you're gonna do this, it can't be so glaring.
Glaring.
Okay.
That does sound bad.
Show me what's bothering you.
Keller.
Again.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I know how you feel about this.
Revenue with no backup.
Here, here and here.
I don't even know what to say.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, okay.
This is fixable, right?
How about if I just push 28,800 out of this into next quarter?
Would you sign it then?
I'm just saying I can't sign it as it currently exists.
Fair enough.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you for the heads-up.
You won't have to deal with this again, I swear.
What if your kids found out?
- If my kids found out?
- This.
What you're doing.
Someday they're gonna be old enough.
How would you explain it to them?
Well, put me on the spot, why don't you?
I guess maybe I'd...
I'd say that I might have feet of clay but that whatever I did, I did thinking of them.
You know, trying to provide.
And I'd ask them to try to take the time to understand...
You know what?
Truth is, I haven't thought that far ahead, Skyler.
I'm just trying to keep my head above water, so...
I'd better get back to it.
Oh, God.
Hi, Walt.
Listen, I can't tal...
I'm at work right now...
What?
Louis dropped him off.
He was here when I got home.
No, no, no, of course.
No, he's not staying.
He understands that.
- I'll bring him anywhere you want.
- Dad.
Well, yeah.
It is rush hour.
I mean, I could fight traffic and bring him down to Beneke now.
But wouldn't it be easier if we...?
Right, okay, good.
So we'll meet you at the house.
Okay, bye.
Why are you doing this?
She's just trying to keep me from seeing you and you're helping her.
Well, son, I mean, your mother, she has her reasons.
What reasons?
They're...
Well, they're...
Well, they're just a little difficult to delineate.
But, I mean, yes, there are two sides to every story, always.
But she...
Yeah.
This is just how it has to be for now, okay?
Now, look, your home is your home and that is where you belong, all right?
But it's where you belong.
Dad, it's your house.
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie everybody knows that you haven't done anything wrong.
Everybody is on your side.
Well, it's not about taking sides, though.
- How can you let her treat you like this?
- Come on.
- How can you just take it?
- Now just listen to me, okay?
No matter what, all of this has nothing to do with how we feel about you, okay?
We both love you very, very much, okay?
You and your sister will come first always.
Come on.
Let's try to see this in a positive light, okay?
Both of us.
Let's just buck up.

You know, fixing up the place totally increases resale value.
I read that in, I wanna say, like TIME magazine.
So, what'd you do with the upstairs bathroom?
All redone.
New tiles in the bathrooms and kitchens granite countertops, new appliances.
All top-of-the line.
Damn.
That's great, Dad.
Think I can get a tour?
These guys are trying to finish up.
Maybe we'd better stay out of their way.
There are pictures on the website, if you want to take a look.
Cool.
You're looking healthy.
I'll tell your mother.
She'll be happy.
Thanks.
You know, I could come by sometime for dinner or something.
Yeah.
Sometime.
Okay.
Later, Dad.
You know, look, he's a high-school teacher.
He's never been in trouble a day in his life.
He finds out he's got lung cancer and now his wife kicks the poor bastard out of his own house.
I mean, look, guys, if anybody rates a little slack, here's the guy.
Hey, Walt.
Remember Officer Cavanaugh?
Officer, I'm very sorry that I lost my temper.
There's no excuse for my behaviour.
It was disrespectful.
Yeah.
Thanks, man.
She's divorcing me.
I don't know what to tell you, buddy.
It is what it is.
She doesn't want me to see the kids.
She said that?
Yeah.
You don't write, you don't call.
God.
It's a disaster.
- It is not a disaster.
- Oh, okay.
It's not a disaster, all right?
She's not going to the cops, she's not gonna tell a living soul.
You wanna know why?
One word: blowback.
If she blabs, it'll be a disaster, for her.
That DEA brother-in-law?
Screwed.
You were right under his nose.
He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue-sniffers at the hobby shop.
The kids?
Paging Dr. Phil.
My daddy's a drug dealer and my mommy turned him in.
And the house?
Gone.
Feds would RICO her and the kids out on the street.
Good luck arguing with them on that.
No.
It's not gonna happen.
She's bluffing and she knows it.
Her going to the police is not the point, Saul.
She's out of my life.
Do you understand?
I've lost my family.
Everything that I care about.
Hey, buddy.
- It's bad.
It's a calamity.
- Oh, my God.
But we live to fight another day.
And after a decent interval of time well, there are other fish in the sea.
You've been out of circulation for a while.
You'll be just amazed at what's out there.
Thailand, the Czech Republic.
I mean, those women are so grateful to even be here.
In the meantime, idle hands are the devil's plaything.
So why don't you get back on the horse and do what you do best?
First step:
Talk to our friend and get cooking.
I can't be the bad guy.
What?
I can't be the bad guy.
Okay.
You know, we'll revisit.
Just promise me you won't hang yourself in the closet.
Pop-pop!
Pop-pop, the ice cream man!
- Don't tell your mom.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
- It's me.
We may have a wife problem.
Look, I need eyes on it.
You got an address?
Hey.
Dinner's gonna be late.
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie are bringing takeout but if you're hungry, I could rustle something up.
Hey, buddy, pass the ketchup, will you?
What?
I've had enough trans-fat for one lifetime.
Two-day drive from the nearest ocean and you're eating raw fish.
That's all I'm saying.
Been awhile since that minnow's been swimming.
Right, buddy?
Yeah.
You know, Flynn here is looking for a part-time job so, I don't know, if you know of anything you might want to...
My name's Walter Jr.
Like, what, you can't even say his name?
If you've changed your mind about being called Flynn all you need to do is just tell me that you don't want to be called Flynn.
Dad didn't even show up till fourth period.
And his eyes were all red, like he's been crying or something.
But you, you don't even care!
And now he won't even drive me home.
He won't say why, but I know it's because you told him not to.
- Honey, I...
- What?
I don't know what your problem is.
You may not love him anymore, but I do.
I mean, why you gotta be...?
Why you gotta be such a bitch?
!
- Hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no.
- Oh, God.
- You can't talk to your mom like that.
- Hank, no.
Hank.
Hank, it's...
It's all right.
Hey, hey.
Skyler, I know that you must have your reasons for all of this.
Sky, the...
I know it's none of my business but keeping Walt from the kids?
I mean...
You're right, Hank.
It's none of your business.
Oh, my God.
After all of that?
Please, tell me that you are still not curious.
- There's nothing to be curious about.
- Oh, please.
The day I heard the words "second cell phone, " I knew.
- Believe me.
Seen it a hundred times.
- Okay.
All right.
So, what?
Stop dancing around it.
What is it exactly that you have seen a hundred times?
Please, please, enlighten me.
Look, a guy like Walt?
Nice guy, decent, smart.
But, let's face it, underachiever, dead-end life, okay?
He gets cancer.
Time's running out.
Mid-life crisis.
He acts up.
He steps out.
And the wife, she catches him.
I mean, it's a story as old as time.
Look, do the math, Marie.
It only comes out one way.
Knowing Walt, he felt so guilty, he probably told her himself.
I...
I don't know.
I think if he cheated on her, that she would have told me by now.
It just feels like something more.
Yes, yes, yes, 24/7 coverage.
Need you ask?
How much is this gonna run me?
Jesus, I'm in the wrong business.
Yeah, I'll call you.
Return of the prodigal, back to the land of the living.
- How you feeling?
- I'm good.
Of course you are.
The world's your oyster.
Am I right?
Unencumbered young man with stacks of cash.
Hey, I'm jealous.
Hand to God, I'm jealous.
Speaking of cash, you know what's giving me heartburn lately?
Your former partner.
This guy, he works like a bastard, right?
Builds a business single-handed.
Finally the big money shows up and what does he do?
He walks out.
Talent like that and he flushes it down the crapper.
It's like Michelangelo won't paint.
Look, I know you're out of it and all but you wouldn't talk to him, would you?
Help him pull his head out of his ass?
All right, all right, scratch that.
Yeah, he won't listen to me, he's not gonna listen to you.
All due respect.
You want a job?
A job?
- Who's got a job for me?
- I do.
There you go.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Thought I'd...
- ...well, visit, if you don't mind.
- Of course not.
- You don't need the room, do you?
- No, no, no.
I just needed some more space to spread out.
Wanted to say hello to little Holly.
Hey, girl.
Hi, baby.
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
Oh, yeah.
She's a beauty.
Look at her.
Hey, thanks for being so flexible on me coming in.
I just wish we had you back full-time.
You do brighten up the place.
Listen, believe me, this is...
I don't want to bring this up, but I can't sign off on these quarterlies.
I'm sorry, I just can't.
Is that right?
If you're gonna do this, it can't be so glaring.
Glaring.
Okay.
That does sound bad.
Show me what's bothering you.
Keller.
Again.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I know how you feel about this.
Revenue with no backup.
Here, here and here.
I don't even know what to say.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, okay.
This is fixable, right?
How about if I just push 28,800 out of this into next quarter?
Would you sign it then?
I'm just saying I can't sign it as it currently exists.
Fair enough.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you for the heads-up.
You won't have to deal with this again, I swear.
What if your kids found out?
- If my kids found out?
- This.
What you're doing.
Someday they're gonna be old enough.
How would you explain it to them?
Well, put me on the spot, why don't you?
I guess maybe I'd...
I'd say that I might have feet of clay but that whatever I did, I did thinking of them.
You know, trying to provide.
And I'd ask them to try to take the time to understand...
You know what?
Truth is, I haven't thought that far ahead, Skyler.
I'm just trying to keep my head above water, so...
I'd better get back to it.
Oh, God.
Hi, Walt.
Listen, I can't tal...
I'm at work right now...
What?
Louis dropped him off.
He was here when I got home.
No, no, no, of course.
No, he's not staying.
He understands that.
- I'll bring him anywhere you want.
- Dad.
Well, yeah.
It is rush hour.
I mean, I could fight traffic and bring him down to Beneke now.
But wouldn't it be easier if we...?
Right, okay, good.
So we'll meet you at the house.
Okay, bye.
Why are you doing this?
She's just trying to keep me from seeing you and you're helping her.
Well, son, I mean, your mother, she has her reasons.
What reasons?
They're...
Well, they're...
Well, they're just a little difficult to delineate.
But, I mean, yes, there are two sides to every story, always.
But she...
Yeah.
This is just how it has to be for now, okay?
Now, look, your home is your home and that is where you belong, all right?
But it's where you belong.
Dad, it's your house.
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie everybody knows that you haven't done anything wrong.
Everybody is on your side.
Well, it's not about taking sides, though.
- How can you let her treat you like this?
- Come on.
- How can you just take it?
- Now just listen to me, okay?
No matter what, all of this has nothing to do with how we feel about you, okay?
We both love you very, very much, okay?
You and your sister will come first always.
Come on.
Let's try to see this in a positive light, okay?
Both of us.
Let's just buck up.
And I'll take you home.
Let me first just hit the old bathroom here.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
- Nice to meet you.
Saul Goodman.
- Nice to meet you.
You're not that lawyer on late-night television, are you?
Better call Saul!
I get it all the time.
We're here to discuss the sale of the property at 9809 Margo.
I get it.
Flat-fee clients, am I right?
Well, folks, today's your lucky day.
I represent a client who shall remain nameless.
However, for our purposes you might just as well visualise a large bag of money.
This individual wants to buy your house today for cash.
- Cash?
- Cash.
I know, in this economy.
The money is already burning a hole in my client's account.
You can ask Mr. Gardiner.
I've shown him all the pertinent financials.
It's the only reason we're sitting here.
Fair enough.
We get a few papers signed and notarised we can take care of this right now.
In fact, I could wire you your money this very afternoon.
There's just one little hair in the soup.
The price.
We feel 875 is very fair.
But I suppose there's always a little wiggle room.
Well, why don't you wiggle us on down to 400 and you got yourselves a deal?
Four hundred thousand?
What is that, a joke?
No, that's my offer.
That's less than half-price.
We put that much into the renovations alone.
Why don't we just cut the clown act and you tell us what you're willing to come up to?
Four hundred thousand.
That's my final offer.
- Waste of time.
- Ridiculous.
How could you possibly imagine we'd entertain this?
- Come on, hon.
- I don't know.
I thought some allowance was in order once I heard about the meth lab.
That used to be in the basement.
I looked over your signed disclosure statements and I don't see any mention of a meth lab.
Nope.
Oh, you got your termite inspection.
That's good.
But no meth lab.
Now, some would call that fraud in service of concealing a felony.
I, myself, am more open-minded.
But it is tricky.
Now, don't get me wrong.
I applaud your cojones.
I mean, good try at sneaking a meth-contaminated property past a buyer.
I mean, could've been a good deal for you.
Too bad.
Now, I could file a suit and encumber this property indefinitely.
Or I could start some criminal proceedings.
But I don't think any of us want that, now, do we?
How about it, counsellor?
Do you concur?
There you go, son.
Come on.
It's not Devil's Island.
Okay.
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.
- Brought pizza.
- Yeah.
Well, I'm making dinner.
Okay, I'll just put it in the fridge.
It's even better the next day.
Hi, honey.
Sorry.
Skyler.
I mean, what kind of example do we want to set here, right?
I mean, can't we at least just sit down and eat a piece of pizza together?
Just hash things out like adults?
We have discussed everything we need to discuss.
I thought I made myself very clear.
I got dipping sticks.
You've reached Walt's temporary number.
Please, leave a message.
When I went out this morning to get the newspaper I saw a pizza on our roof.
Would you know anything about that?
Listen to me, Walt.
You need to control yourself.
Calm down, accept the situation and keep your distance.
If you can't manage that, I will get a restraining order.
Skyler.
Skyler.
Got your restraining order right here!
Restrain this!
Breaking even is not so bad.
In this economy, a lot of people would kill to break even.
Poor Jake.
He had his heart set on going to Space Camp.
Oh, no.
Oh, God.
This is all we need.
Hey, Mom, Dad.
How's it going?
Jesse, it's really not a good time.
Come on.
Jesse, the house has been sold.
The new owners are expected at any moment.
- Where do you think you're going?
- Inside.
I bought the place.
Be back by seven, okay?
Love you.
Bye.
No!
Oh, God.
It's me.
There's something he should know about.
Hold on.
* The heat was hot and the ground was dry *
* But the air was full of sound *

Good morning, Officer.
Sir, can you turn the music down?
Oh, yeah.
All right.
Down means off.
Of course.
Okay.
You know why I pulled you over this morning?
Well, I'm-
- I'm pretty sure I wasn't speeding.
I've been using the cruise control, so I--
No, sir.
Your windshield.
License and registration, please.
Right.
Uh...
This-
- This was from Wayfarer 515.
Um, my house was in the debris field.
Okay.
Uh, and that's-- that's what shattered my windshield-- some piece of wreckage from the plane.
I understand.
Yoknow of-- of Flight 515, the plane crash?
You're wearing the ribbon.
Yes, sir.
I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515.
I was one of the first responders on the scene that day.
Then what are you doing?
Citing you, sir.
What?
What, you don't believe me?
Sir, regardless of how that windshield was damaged, this car is unsafe to drive in this condition.
Stay in the car, please.
Wait.
Wait just a minute.
Just one minute.
Sir, I asked you to stay in the vehicle.
No, no, no.
I can get out of my own car.
Sir, listen--
No, no, no.
You listen to me.
It's time for you to listen to me.
Sir, what you need to do is take a deep breath, calm down This is America.
and get back in that car now.
I have rights.
Do you understand that?
At least have the common decency to hear me out.
I need you to step back right now.
Did you even hear what I said?
Sir, calm down.
Now you're giving me a ticket?
I told you that my house was in the debris field.
Do you have the remotest inkling of what that means?
Sir, calm down.
Hellfire rained down on my house
Sir, I need you to step back now.
where my children sleep!
There were body parts in my yard!
Sir, this is your last warning.
You gotta be kidding me!
You got about two seconds to stand down, or I'm gonna pepper spray you.
You're gonna pepper spray?
Perfect!
That is just perfect!
Pepper spray the man who's expressing his opinion under the First Amendment!
Lastly, a little something from down El Paso way.
Border Patrol came across multiple homicides just this side of the border.
Truck turn out to be a chicken run out of Juarez and Laredo.
Border Patrol's been playing hide-and-seek with these polleros for two years.
But this time, as soon as they made it acro, someone hit them-- hit them hard.
We're talking a driver and nine illegals.
No sign of the shooters.
This truck was carrying more than just people.
What are we looking at?
Weed, coke, or meth?
Nah.
Doesn't look like they were transporting narcotics.
So, why did the Border Patrol kick this to us?
They didn't.
I pulled it.
You ask me, ths high-end cartel work.
Los Zetas, maybe.
Question is, why do we have Juarez-style action on our side of the DMZ?
They sending a message or clearing a path?
Or was this about stopping one particular border-hopper?
Maybe one of those extra-crispies knew something he shouldn't.
Anyway, keep your eyes open.
All right.
That's it.
Slow news day.
Add one more to the countdown.
Oh, yeah?
What's that, Gomie?
We're waiting on that famous blue meth of yours.
29 days since we saw it last.
Yeah, well, it's still out there, Gomie.
Don't worry.
Local PD.
I gotta take this.
Gomie, go beat your piÃ±ata.
Rest of you jokers- too d- -- quiet in here.
Go catch some bad guys.
Schrader.
Hey, what's up, Paul?
What?
Jesse?
Hey, Dad.
So you're fixing up the house, huh?
Doing a little work, yeah.
Uh, I'll bounce.
It's-
- It's cool.
You doing okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.
I just happened to be driving by and saw the sign.
So, you're selling the place.
In this market.
Can you believe it?
I see you moved the garage.
That's bold.
Your mother's idea.
It's quite an operation.
We did, all new stucco, all the master suite, sandblasted, fumigated the basement...
Right on.
Yeah.
Fixing up the place totally increases resale value.
I read that in- I want to say, like,
Time magazine.
So, what'd you do with the upstairs bathroom?
All redone.
New tiles in the bathrooms and kitchens, granite countertops, new appliances-- all top of the line.
D---.
That's great, Dad.
Think, uh, I can get a tour?
Eh, these guys are trying to finish up.
Maybe we'd better stay out of their way.
There are pictures on the Web site, if you wanna take a look.
Cool.
You're looking healthy.
I'll tell your mother.
She'll be happy.
Thanks.
You know, I could come by sometime for, uh, dinner or something.
Yeah.
Sometime.
Okay.
Later, Dad.
You know, look, he's a high school teacher over at Wynne.
Never been in trouble a day of his life.
Found out he's got lung cancer, and now his wife kicks the poor b------ out of his own house.
I mean, look, guys, if anybody rates a little slack, here's the guy.
Hey, Walt, uh, you remember Officer Cavanaugh?
Officer, I'm very sorry that I lost my tper.

One word:
"blowback."
If she blabs, it'll be a disaster for her.
That DEA brother-in-law?
Whew!
Screwed.
You were right under his nose.
He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue-sniffers at the hobby shop.
The kids-
- Paging Dr. Phil.
My daddy's a drug dealer, and my mommy turned him in.
And the house-- gone.
The feds will come and RICO her and the kids out on the street.
Ooh, good luck arguing with them on that.

Who's got a job for me?
I do.
Okay, let's see some jokers.
I used to be an English teacher, so I'd better take grammar for 100.
All right.
Child stars for 100.
Hi.
Hey.
Thought I'd, uh, well, visit, if you don't mind.
No, of course not.
You don't, uh...
You don't need the room, do you?
No.
I just needed some more space to spread out.
Just wanted to say hello to little Holly here.
Hey, girl.
Hi.
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
Oh, yeah.
She is a beauty.
Look at her.
Hey, thanks for being so flexible on me coming in.
Well, I just wish we had you back full time.
You do brighten up the place.
Listen, believe me, this is, uh...
I don't wanna bring this up, but I-
- I can't sign off on these quarterlies.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
Is that right?
If you're gonna do this, Ted, you can't be so glaring about it.
Glaring.
Okay.
That does sound bad.
Uh, show me what's bothering you.
Keller.
No.
Again...
G--, I'm sorry.
I know how you feel about this.
Revenue with no backup.
Here, here, and here.
I don't even know what to say.
Yeah.
Um...
Yeah, well, uh...
Okay.
This is- This is fixable, right?
How about if I just push, uh, 28,800, um, out of this into next quarter?
Would you sign it then?
I'm--
I'm just saying
I can't sign it as it currently exists.
Fair enough.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you for the heads-up.
Well, you won't have to deal with this again,
I swear.
What if your kids found out?
If my kids found out?
This-- what you're doing.
I mean, someday, they're gonna be old enough.
How would you explain it to them?
Well-
- Wow.
Put me on the spot, why don't you?
I guess maybe I'd, um--
I'd say that, uh, I might have feet of clay that--
But that whatever I did, I did thinking of them.
You know?
Trying to provide.
And, uh, I'd ask them to try to take the time to understand...
You know what?
Truth is,
I haven't thought that far ahead, Skyler.
I'm just trying to keep my head above water, so...
I better get back to it.
Oh, G--.
Hi, Walt.
Listen.
I'm-
- I can't talk- I'm at work right now.
What?
Louis dropped him off.
He was here when I got home.
No, no, no.
Of course.
No.
He's not staying.
He understands that.
I'll-
- I'll bring him anywhere you want.
Dad...
Well, yeah, it is rush hour.
I mean, I could fight traffic and bring him down to Beneke now, but wouldn't it be easier if we...
Right.
Okay.
Good.
So we'll meet you at the house.
Okay.
Bye.
W-Why are you doing this?
She's just trying to k-keep me from seeing you, and you're helping her.
No.
No, son.
I mean, your-- your mother-- she has her reasons.
What reasons?
They're, uh...
Well, they're...
Well, they're just a little difficult to delineate, but--
I mean, yes, there are two sides to every story.
Always.
But, uh, she, uh...
Yeah.
This is just how it has to be.
For now.
Okay?
And, look, your home is your home, and that is where you belong, okay?
But it's where you belong.
Dad, it-- it's your house.
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie-- everybody knows that you hen't done anything wrong.
Everybody is on your side.
Well, it's-- it's-- it's not about taking sides, though.
How can-
- How can you let her treat you like this?
Now, come on.
How-
- How--
How can you just-- just take it?
Just listen to me, okay?
No matter what, all of this has nothing to do with how we feel about you, okay?
We both love you very, very much, okay?
You and your sister will come first, always.
Hmm?
Now, come on.
Let's, uh...
Let's try to see this in a positive light, okay?
Both of us.
Let's just buck up.
Then I'll take you home.
Uh, let me first just hit the old bathroom.

Hello.
Good afternoon.
Nice to meet you.
Saul Goodman.
Nice to meet you.
You're not that lawyer on late-night television, are you?
Better call Saul!
I get it all the time.
We're here to discuss the sale of the property at 9809 Margo.
I get it.
Flat-fee clients.
Am I right?
Well, folks, today's your lucky day.
I represent a client who shall remain nameless.
However, for our purposes, you might just as well visualize a large bag of money.
This individual wants to buy your use today, for cash.
Cash?
Cash.
I know.
In this economy.
In fact, the money is already burning a hole in my client's account.
You can ask Mr. Gardiner.
I've shown him all the pertinent financials.
It the only reason we're sitting here.
Fair enough.
We, uh, get a few papers signed and notarized, we can take care of this right now.
In fact, I can wire you your money this very afternoon.
There's just one little hair in the soup-- uh, the price.
We feel 875 is very fair.
But I suppose there's always a little, uh, wiggle room.
Well, you wiggle us on down to 400, and you got yourselves a deal.
400,0?
What is that, a joke?
No, that's my offer.
That's less than half price.
We put almost that much into the renovations alone.
Why don't we just cut the clown act and you tell us what you're willing to come up to?
400,000.
That's my final offer.
Well, this is a waste of time.
Ridiculous.
How could you possibly imagine that we would entertain this?
Come on, hon.
I don't know.
I just thought some allowance was in order once I heard about the meth lab.
The one that used to be in the basement.
I looked over your signed disclosure statements, and I don't see any mention of a meth lab.
No.
No.
Oh, you got your termite inspection.
That's good.
But no meth lab.
Now, some would call that fraud in service of concealing a felony.
I, myself, am more open-minded.
But it is tricky.
Don't get me wrong.
I applaud your c------.
I mean, good try in sneaking a meth-contaminated property past the buyer.
I mean, you know, could've been a good deal for you.
Too bad.
Now, I uid file a suit and encumber this property indefinitely, or I could start some criminal proceedings.
But I don't think any of us want that now, do we?
How about it, counselor?
Do you concur?
*
Ta-da.
Here you go, son.
Come on.
It's not Devil's Island.
Okay.
Ooh.
Here we go.
Oh.
Hey.
Hello.
Ah.
Uh, mmm.
Brought pizza.
Yeah.
Well, I'm making dinner.
Oh, okay.
I'll just, uh, put it in the fridge.
It's even better the next day, huh?
Hi, honey.
Uh...
Sorry.
Yeah.
All right.
Skyler...
Honey, what kind of example do we want to set here?
Right?
I mean, can't we at least just sit down and eat a piece of pizza together?
Just to hash things out like adults?
You know--
We have...discussed everything we ne to discuss.
I thought I made myself very clear.
I got dipping sticks.
You've reached Walt's temporary number.
Please leave a message.
When I went out this morning to get the newspaper,
I saw a pizza on our roof.
Would you know anything about that?
Listen to me, Walt.
You need to control yourself.
Calm down, accept the situation, and keep your distance.
If you can't manage that,
I will get a restraining order.
Skyler.
Skyler.
I got your restraining order right here!
Restrain this!
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Breaking even's not so bad.
In this economy, a lot of people would kill to break even.
Poor Jake.
He had his heart set on going to space camp.
Oh, no.
Oh, G--.
This is all we need.
Hey, Mom, Dad.
How's it going?
Uh, Jesse, it's, uh, really not a good time.
Jesse, the house has been sold.
The new owners are expected at any moment.
Where do you think you're going?
Inside.
I bought the place.
Be back by 7, okay?
I love you.
Bye.
Ahh!
Jeez.
Come on.
Oh, G--!
Ahh!
Oh, s---
- No!
Oh, G--.

- Good morning, officer.
- Can you turn the music down?
Oh, okay.
Down means off.
You know why I pulled you over this morning?
Well, I'm pretty sure I wasn't speeding.
I've been using the cruise control, so I don't...
No, sir, your windshield.
License and registration, please.
Right.
This...
This was from Wayfarer 515.
- My house was in the debris field.
- Okay.
And that's what shattered my windshield some piece of wreckage from the plane.
I understand.
You know of flight 515, the plane crash?
You're wearing the ribbon.
Yes, sir.
I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515.
I was one of the first responders on the scene.
- Then what are you doing?
- Citing you, sir.
What?
What, you don't believe me?
Regardless of how that windshield was damaged this car is unsafe to drive in this condition.
Stay in the car, please.
Wait.
Wait just a minute.
Just one minute.
- I asked you to stay in the vehicle.
- I can get out of my own car.
- Sir, listen...
- No, you listen to me.
It's time for you to listen to me.
- Take a deep breath, calm down.
- This is America, okay?
- Get back in that car.
- I have rights.
You understand that?
At least have the common decency to hear me out.
- Step back now.
- Did you even hear what I said?
- Sir, calm down.
- You're giving me a ticket?
I told you that my house was in the debris field.
Do you have the remotest inkling of what that means?
- Sir, calm down.
- Hellfire rained down on my house where my children sleep!
- I need you to step back now.
- There were body parts in my yard!
- Are you kidding me?
!
- Sir, last warning.
- You got two seconds to stand down.
- Or?
- I'm gonna pepper-spray you.
- Pepper-spray me.
That is just perfect.
Pepper-spray the man who's expressing his opinion under the First Amendment!
Lastly a little something from down El Paso way.
Border Patrol came across multiple homicides just this side of the border.
Truck turns out to be a chicken run out of Juarez into Laredo.
Border Patrol's been playing hide-and-seek with these polleros for two years.
But this time, soon as they made it across, someone hit them.
Hit them hard.
We're talking a driver and nine illegals.
No sign of the shooters.
So this truck was carrying more than just people.
What are we looking at, weed, coke or meth?
No, doesn't look like they were transporting narcotics.
Why'd the Border Patrol kick this to us?
They didn't.
I pulled it.
You ask me, this is high-end cartel work.
Los Zetas, maybe.
Question is, why do we have Juarez-style action on our side of the DMZ?
They sending a message?
Clearing a path?
Or was this about stopping one particular border-hopper?
Maybe one of those extra-crispies knew something he shouldn't.
Anyway, keep your eyes open.
All right, that's it.
Slow news day.
Add one more to the countdown.
Oh, yeah?
What's that, Gomey?
We're waiting on that famous blue meth of yours.
Twenty-nine days since we saw it last.
It's still out there, Gomey.
Don't worry.
Local P.D. I gotta take this.
Gomey, go beat your piñata.
Rest of you jokers, too damn quiet in here.
Catch some bad guys.
Schrader.
Hey, what's up, Walt?
What?
Jesse?
Hey, Dad.
- Fixing up the house, huh?
- Doing a little work, yeah.
Well, I'll bounce.
It's cool.
You doing okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.
I just happened to be driving by and saw the sign.
So you're selling the place.
In this market.
Can you believe it?
I see you moved the garage.
That's bold.
Your mother's idea.
It's quite an operation.
We did all new stucco, all new master suite sandblasted, fumigated the basement.
Right on.
Yeah.
You know, fixing up the place totally increases resale value.
I read that in, I wanna say, like TIME magazine.
So, what'd you do with the upstairs bathroom?
All redone.
New tiles in the bathrooms and kitchens granite countertops, new appliances.
All top-of-the line.
Damn.
That's great, Dad.
Think I can get a tour?
These guys are trying to finish up.
Maybe we'd better stay out of their way.
There are pictures on the website, if you want to take a look.
Cool.
You're looking healthy.
I'll tell your mother.
She'll be happy.
Thanks.
You know, I could come by sometime for dinner or something.
Yeah.
Sometime.
Okay.
Later, Dad.
You know, look, he's a high-school teacher.
He's never been in trouble a day in his life.
He finds out he's got lung cancer and now his wife kicks the poor bastard out of his own house.
I mean, look, guys, if anybody rates a little slack, here's the guy.
Hey, Walt.
Remember Officer Cavanaugh?
Officer, I'm very sorry that I lost my temper.
There's no excuse for my behavior.
It was disrespectful.
Yeah.
Thanks, man.
She's divorcing me.
I don't know what to tell you, buddy.
It is what it is.
She doesn't want me to see the kids.
She said that?
Yeah.
You don't write, you don't call.
God.
It's a disaster.
- It is not a disaster.
- Oh, okay.
It's not a disaster, all right?
She's not going to the cops, she's not gonna tell a living soul.
You wanna know why?
One word:
Blowback.
If she blabs, it'll be a disaster, for her.
That DEA brother-in-law?
Screwed.
You were right under his nose.
He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue-sniffers at the hobby shop.
The kids?
Paging Dr. Phil.
My daddy's a drug dealer and my mommy turned him in.
And the house?
Gone.
Feds would RICO her and the kids out on the street.
Good luck arguing with them on that.
No.
It's not gonna happen.
She's bluffing and she knows it.
Her going to the police is not the point, Saul.
She's out of my life.
Do you understand?
I've lost my family.
Everything that I care about.
Hey, buddy.
- It's bad.
It's a calamity.
- Oh, my God.
But we live to fight another day.
And after a decent interval of time well, there are other fish in the sea.
You've been out of circulation for a while.
You'll be just amazed at what's out there.
Thailand, the Czech Republic.
I mean, those women are so grateful to even be here.
In the meantime, idle hands are the devil's plaything.
So why don't you get back on the horse and do what you do best?
First step:
Talk to our friend and get cooking.
I can't be the bad guy.
What?
I can't be the bad guy.
Okay.
You know, we'll revisit.
Just promise me you won't hang yourself in the closet.
Pop-pop!
Pop-pop, the ice cream man!
- Don't tell your mom.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
- It's me.
We may have a wife problem.
Look, I need eyes on it.
You got an address?
Hey.
Dinner's gonna be late.
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie are bringing takeout but if you're hungry, I could rustle something up.
Hey, buddy, pass the ketchup, will you?
What?
I've had enough trans-fat for one lifetime.
Two-day drive from the nearest ocean and you're eating raw fish.
That's all I'm saying.
Been awhile since that minnow's been swimming.
Right, buddy?
Yeah.
You know, Flynn here is looking for a part-time job so, I don't know, if you know of anything you might want to...
My name's Walter Jr.
Like, what, you can't even say his name?
If you've changed your mind about being called Flynn all you need to do is just tell me that you don't want to be called Flynn.
Dad didn't even show up till fourth period.
And his eyes were all red, like he's been crying or something.
But you, you don't even care!
And now he won't even drive me home.
He won't say why, but I know it's because you told him not to.
- Honey, I...
- What?
I don't know what your problem is.
You may not love him anymore, but I do.
I mean, why you gotta be...?
Why you gotta be such a bitch?
!
- Hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no.
- Oh, God.
- You can't talk to your mom like that.
- Hank, no.
Hank.
Hank, it's...
It's all right.
Hey, hey.
Skyler, I know that you must have your reasons for all of this.
Sky, the...
I know it's none of my business but keeping Walt from the kids?
I mean...
You're right, Hank.
It's none of your business.
Oh, my God.
After all of that?
Please, tell me that you are still not curious.
- There's nothing to be curious about.
- Oh, please.
The day I heard the words "second cell phone," I knew.
- Believe me.
Seen it a hundred times.
- Okay.
All right.
So, what?
Stop dancing around it.
What is it exactly that you have seen a hundred times?
Please, please, enlighten me.
Look, a guy like Walt?
Nice guy, decent, smart.
But, let's face it, underachiever, dead-end life, okay?
He gets cancer.
Time's running out.
Mid-life crisis.
He acts up.
He steps out.
And the wife, she catches him.
I mean, it's a story as old as time.
Look, do the math, Marie.
It only comes out one way.
Knowing Walt, he felt so guilty, he probably told her himself.
I...
I don't know.
I think if he cheated on her, that she would have told me by now.
It just feels like something more.
Yes, yes, yes, 24/7 coverage.
Need you ask?
How much is this gonna run me?
Jesus, I'm in the wrong business.
Yeah, I'll call you.
Return of the prodigal, back to the land of the living.
- How you feeling?
- I'm good.
Of course you are.
The world's your oyster.
Am I right?
Unencumbered young man with stacks of cash.
Hey, I'm jealous.
Hand to God, I'm jealous.
Speaking of cash, you know what's giving me heartburn lately?
Your former partner.
This guy, he works like a bastard, right?
Builds a business single-handed.
Finally the big money shows up and what does he do?
He walks out.
Talent like that and he flushes it down the crapper.
It's like Michelangelo won't paint.
Look, I know you're out of it and all but you wouldn't talk to him, would you?
Help him pull his head out of his ass?
All right, all right, scratch that.
Yeah, he won't listen to me, he's not gonna listen to you.
All due respect.
You want a job?
A job?
- Who's got a job for me?
- I do.
There you go.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Thought I'd...
- ...well, visit, if you don't mind.
- Of course not.
- You don't need the room, do you?
- No, no, no.
I just needed some more space to spread out.
Wanted to say hello to little Holly.
Hey, girl.
Hi, baby.
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
Oh, yeah.
She's a beauty.
Look at her.
Hey, thanks for being so flexible on me coming in.
I just wish we had you back full-time.
You do brighten up the place.
Listen, believe me, this is...
I don't want to bring this up, but I can't sign off on these quarterlies.
I'm sorry, I just can't.
Is that right?
If you're gonna do this, it can't be so glaring.
Glaring.
Okay.
That does sound bad.
Show me what's bothering you.
Keller.
Again.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I know how you feel about this.
Revenue with no backup.
Here, here and here.
I don't even know what to say.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, okay.
This is fixable, right?
How about if I just push 28,800 out of this into next quarter?
Would you sign it then?
I'm just saying I can't sign it as it currently exists.
Fair enough.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you for the heads-up.
You won't have to deal with this again, I swear.
What if your kids found out?
- If my kids found out?
- This.
What you're doing.
Someday they're gonna be old enough.
How would you explain it to them?
Well, put me on the spot, why don't you?
I guess maybe I'd...
I'd say that I might have feet of clay but that whatever I did, I did thinking of them.
You know, trying to provide.
And I'd ask them to try to take the time to understand...
You know what?
Truth is, I haven't thought that far ahead, Skyler.
I'm just trying to keep my head above water, so...
I'd better get back to it.
Oh, God.
Hi, Walt.
Listen, I can't tal...
I'm at work right now...
What?
Louis dropped him off.
He was here when I got home.
No, no, no, of course.
No, he's not staying.
He understands that.
- I'll bring him anywhere you want.
- Dad.
Well, yeah.
It is rush hour.
I mean, I could fight traffic and bring him down to Beneke now.
But wouldn't it be easier if we...?
Right, okay, good.
So we'll meet you at the house.
Okay, bye.
Why are you doing this?
She's just trying to keep me from seeing you and you're helping her.
Well, son, I mean, your mother, she has her reasons.
What reasons?
They're...
Well, they're...
Well, they're just a little difficult to delineate.
But, I mean, yes, there are two sides to every story, always.
But she...
Yeah.
This is just how it has to be for now, okay?
Now, look, your home is your home and that is where you belong, all right?
But it's where you belong.
Dad, it's your house.
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie everybody knows that you haven't done anything wrong.
Everybody is on your side.
Well, it's not about taking sides, though.
- How can you let her treat you like this?
- Come on.
- How can you just take it?
- Now just listen to me, okay?
No matter what, all of this has nothing to do with how we feel about you, okay?
We both love you very, very much, okay?
You and your sister will come first always.
Come on.
Let's try to see this in a positive light, okay?

Now, I could file a suit and encumber this property indefinitely.
Or I could start some criminal proceedings.
But I don't think any of us want that, now, do we?
How about it, counselor?
Do you concur?
There you go, son.
Come on.
It's not Devil's Island.
Okay.
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.
- Brought pizza.
- Yeah.
Well, I'm making dinner.
Okay, I'll just put it in the fridge.
It's even better the next day.
Hi, honey.
Sorry.
Skyler.
I mean, what kind of example do we want to set here, right?
I mean, can't we at least just sit down and eat a piece of pizza together?
Just hash things out like adults?
We have discussed everything we need to discuss.
I thought I made myself very clear.
I got dipping sticks.
You've reached Walt's temporary number.
Please, leave a message.
When I went out this morning to get the newspaper I saw a pizza on our roof.
Would you know anything about that?
Listen to me, Walt.
You need to control yourself.
Calm down, accept the situation and keep your distance.
If you can't manage that, I will get a restraining order.
Skyler.
Skyler.
Got your restraining order right here!
Restrain this!
Breaking even is not so bad.
In this economy, a lot of people would kill to break even.
Poor Jake.
He had his heart set on going to Space Camp.
Oh, no.
Oh, God.
This is all we need.
Hey, Mom, Dad.
How's it going?
Jesse, it's really not a good time.
Come on.
Jesse, the house has been sold.
The new owners are expected at any moment.
- Where do you think you're going?
- Inside.
I bought the place.
Be back by seven, okay?
Love you.
Bye.
No!
Oh, God.
It's me.
There's something he should know about.
Hold on.

- Good morning, officer.
- Can you turn the music down?
Oh, okay.
Down means off.
You know why I pulled you over this morning?
Well, I'm pretty sure I wasn't speeding.
I've been using the cruise control, so I don't...
No, sir, your windshield.
License and registration, please.
Right.
This...
This was from Wayfarer 515.
- My house was in the debris field.
- Okay.
And that's what shattered my windshield some piece of wreckage from the plane.
I understand.
You know of flight 515, the plane crash?
You're wearing the ribbon.
Yes, sir.
I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515.
I was one of the first responders on the scene.
- Then what are you doing?
- Citing you, sir.
What?
What, you don't believe me?
Regardless of how that windshield was damaged this car is unsafe to drive in this condition.
Stay in the car, please.
Wait.
Wait just a minute.
Just one minute.
- I asked you to stay in the vehicle.
- I can get out of my own car.
- Sir, listen...
- No, you listen to me.
It's time for you to listen to me.
- Take a deep breath, calm down.
- This is America, okay?
- Get back in that car.
- I have rights.
You understand that?
At least have the common decency to hear me out.
- Step back now.
- Did you even hear what I said?
- Sir, calm down.
- You're giving me a ticket?
I told you that my house was in the debris field.
Do you have the remotest inkling of what that means?
- Sir, calm down.
- Hellfire rained down on my house where my children sleep!
- I need you to step back now.
- There were body parts in my yard!
- Are you kidding me?
!
- Sir, last warning.
- You got two seconds to stand down.
- Or?
- I'm gonna pepper-spray you.
- Pepper-spray me.
That is just perfect.
Pepper-spray the man who's expressing his opinion under the First Amendment!
Lastly a little something from down El Paso way.
Border Patrol came across multiple homicides just this side of the border.
...with these polleros for two years.
But this time, soon as they made it across, someone hit them.
Hit them hard.
We're talking a driver and nine illegals.
No sign of the shooters.
So this truck was carrying more than just people.
What are we looking at, weed, coke or meth?
No, doesn't look like they were transporting narcotics.
Why'd the Border Patrol kick this to us?
They didn't.
I pulled it.
You ask me, this is high-end cartel work.
Los Zetas, maybe.
Question is, why do we have Juarez-style action on our side of the DMZ?
They sending a message?
Clearing a path?
Or was this about stopping one particular border-hopper?
Maybe one of those... extra-crispies knew something he shouldn't.
Anyway, keep your eyes open.
All right, that's it.
Slow news day.
Add one more to the countdown.
Oh, yeah?
What's that, Gomey?
We're waiting on that famous blue meth of yours.
Twenty-nine days since we saw it last.
It's still out there, Gomey.
Don't worry.
Local P.D. I gotta take this.
Gomey, go beat your piñata.
Rest of you jokers, too damn quiet in here.
Catch some bad guys.
Schrader.
Hey, what's up, Walt?
What?
Jesse?
Hey, Dad.
- Fixing up the house, huh?
- Doing a little work, yeah.
Well, I'll bounce.
It's cool.
You doing okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.
I just happened to be driving by and saw the sign.
So you're selling the place.
In this market.
Can you believe it?
I see you moved the garage.
That's bold.
Your mother's idea.
It's quite an operation.
We did all new stucco, all new master suite sandblasted, fumigated the basement.
Right on.
Yeah.
You know, fixing up the place totally increases resale value.
I read that in, I wanna say, like TIME magazine.
So, what'd you do with the upstairs bathroom?
All redone.
New tiles in the bathrooms and kitchens granite countertops, new appliances.
All top-of-the line.
Damn.
That's great, Dad.
Think I can get a tour?
These guys are trying to finish up.
Maybe we'd better stay out of their way.
There are pictures on the website, if you want to take a look.
Cool.
You're looking healthy.
I'll tell your mother.
She'll be happy.
Thanks.
You know, I could come by sometime for dinner or something.
Yeah.
Sometime.
Okay.
Later, Dad.
You know, look, he's a high-school teacher.
He's never been in trouble a day in his life.
He finds out he's got lung cancer and now his wife kicks the poor bastard out of his own house.
I mean, look, guys, if anybody rates a little slack, here's the guy.
Hey, Walt.
Remember Officer Cavanaugh?
Officer, I'm very sorry that I lost my temper.
There's no excuse for my behaviour.
It was disrespectful.
Yeah.
Thanks, man.
She's divorcing me.
I don't know what to tell you, buddy.
It is what it is.
She doesn't want me to see the kids.
She said that?
Yeah.
You don't write, you don't call.
God.
It's a disaster.
- It is not a disaster.
- Oh, okay.
It's not a disaster, all right?
She's not going to the cops, she's not gonna tell a living soul.
You wanna know why?
One word:
Blowback.
If she blabs, it'll be a disaster, for her.
That DEA brother-in-law?
Screwed.
You were right under his nose.
He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue-sniffers at the hobby shop.
The kids?
Paging Dr. Phil.
My daddy's a drug dealer and my mommy turned him in.
And the house?
Gone.
Feds would RICO her and the kids out on the street.
Good luck arguing with them on that.
No.
It's not gonna happen.
She's bluffing and she knows it.
Her going to the police is not the point, Saul.
She's out of my life.
Do you understand?
I've lost my family.
Everything that I care about.
Hey, buddy.
- It's bad.
It's a calamity.
- Oh, my God.
But we live to fight another day.
And after a decent interval of time well, there are other fish in the sea.
You've been out of circulation for a while.
You'll be just amazed at what's out there.
Thailand, the Czech Republic.
I mean, those women are so grateful to even be here.
In the meantime, idle hands are the devil's plaything.
So why don't you get back on the horse and do what you do best?
First step:
Talk to our friend and get cooking.
I can't be the bad guy.
What?
I can't be the bad guy.
Okay.
You know, we'll revisit.
Just promise me you won't hang yourself in the closet.
Pop-pop!
Pop-pop, the ice cream man!
- Don't tell your mom.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
- It's me.
We may have a wife problem.
Look, I need eyes on it.
You got an address?
Hey.
Dinner's gonna be late.
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie are bringing takeout but if you're hungry, I could rustle something up.
Hey, buddy, pass the ketchup, will you?
What?
I've had enough trans-fat for one lifetime.
Two-day drive from the nearest ocean and you're... eating raw fish.
That's all I'm saying.
Been awhile since that minnow's been swimming.
Right, buddy?
Yeah.
You know, Flynn here is looking for a part-time job so, I don't know, if you know of anything you might want to...
My name's Walter Jr.
Like, what, you can't even say his name?
If you've changed your mind about being called Flynn all you need to do is just tell me that you don't want to be called Flynn.
Dad didn't even show up till fourth period.
And his eyes were all red, like he's been crying or something.
But you, you don't even care!
And now he won't even drive me home.
He won't say why, but I know it's because you told him not to.
- Honey, I...
- What?
I don't know what your problem is.
You may not love him anymore, but I do.
I mean, why you gotta be...?
Why you gotta be such a bitch?
!
- Hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no.
- Oh, God.
- You can't talk to your mom like that.
- Hank, no.
Hank.
Hank, it's...
It's all right.
Hey, hey.
Skyler, I know that you must have your reasons for all of this.
Sky, the...
I know it's none of my business but keeping Walt from the kids?
I mean...
You're right, Hank.
It's none of your business.
Oh, my God.
After all of that?
Please, tell me that you are still not curious.
- There's nothing to be curious about.
- Oh, please.
The day I heard the words "second cell phone".
I knew.
- Believe me.
Seen it a hundred times.
- Okay.
All right.
So, what?
Stop dancing around it.
What is it exactly that you have seen a hundred times?
Please, pleasee... enlighten me.
Look, a guy like Walt?
Nice guy, decent, smart.
But, let's face it, underachiever, dead-end life, okay?
He gets cancer.
Time's running out.
Mid-life crisis.
He acts up.
He steps out.
And the wife, she catches him.
I mean, it's a story as old as time.
Look, do the math, Marie.
It only comes out one way.
Knowing Walt, he felt so guilty, he probably told her himself.
I...
I don't know.
I think if he cheated on her, that she would have told me by now.
It just feels like something more.
Yes, yes, yes, 24l7 coverage.
Need you ask?
How much is this gonna run me?
Jesus, I'm in the wrong business.
Yeah, I'll call you.
Return of the prodigal, back to the land of the living.
- How you feeling?
- I'm good.
Of course you are.
The world's your oyster.
Am I right?
Unencumbered young man with stacks of cash.
Hey, I'm jealous.
Hand to God, I'm jealous.
Speaking of cash, you know what's giving me heartburn lately?
Your former partner.
This guy, he works like a bastard, right?
Builds a business single-handed.
Finally the big money shows up and what does he do?
He walks out.
Talent like that and he flushes it down the crapper.
It's like Michelangelo won't paint.
Look, I know you're out of it and all but you wouldn't talk to him, would you?
Help him pull his head out of his ass?
All right, all right, scratch that.
Yeah, he won't listen to me, he's not gonna listen to you.
All due respect.
You want a job?
A job?
- Who's got a job for me?
- I do.
There you go.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Thought I'd well, visit, if you don't mind.
- Of course not.
- You don't need the room, do you?
- No, no, no.
I just needed some more space to spread out.
Wanted to say hello to little Holly.
Hey, girl.
Hi, baby.
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
Oh, yeah.
She's a beauty.
Look at her.
Hey, thanks for being so flexible on me coming in.
I just wish we had you back full-time.
You do brighten up the place.
Listen, believe me, this is...
I don't want to bring this up, but I can't sign off on these quarterlies.
I'm sorry, I just can't.
Is that right?
If you're gonna do this, it can't be so glaring.
Glaring.
Okay.
That does sound bad.
Show me what's bothering you.
Keller.
Again.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I know how you feel about this.
Revenue with no backup.
Here, here and here.
I don't even know what to say.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, okay.
This is fixable, right?
How about if I just push 28,800 out of this into next quarter?
Would you sign it then?
I'm just saying I can't sign it as it currently exists.
Fair enough.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you for the heads-up.
You won't have to deal with this again, I swear.
What if your kids found out?
- Lf my kids found out?
- This.
What you're doing.
Someday they're gonna be old enough.
How would you explain it to them?
Well, put me on the spot, why don't you?
I guess maybe I'd...
I'd say that I might have feet of clay but that whatever I did, I did thinking of them.
You know, trying to provide.
And I'd ask them to try to take the time to understand...
You know what?
Truth is, I haven't thought that far ahead, Skyler.
I'm just trying to keep my head above water, so...
I'd better get back to it.
Oh, God.
Hi, Walt.
Listen, I can't tal...
I'm at work right now...
What?
Louis dropped him off.
He was here when I got home.
No, no, no, of course.
No, he's not staying.
He understands that.
- I'll bring him anywhere you want.
- Dad.
Well, yeah.
It is rush hour.
I mean, I could fight traffic and bring him down to Beneke now.
But wouldn't it be... easier if we...?
Right, okay, good.
So we'll meet you at the house.
Okay, bye.
Why are you doing this?
She's just trying to keep me from seeing you and you're helping her.
Well, son, I mean, your mother, she has her reasons.
What reasons?
They're...
Well, they're...
Well, they're just a little difficult to delineate.
But, I mean, yes, there are two sides to every story, always.
But she...
Yeah.
This is just how it has to be for now, okay?
Now, look, your home is your home and that is where you belong, all right?
But it's where you belong.
Dad, it's your house.
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie everybody knows that you haven't done anything wrong.
Everybody is on your side.
Well, it's not about taking sides, though.
- How can you let her treat you like this?
- Come on.
- How can you just take it?
- Now just listen to me, okay?
No matter what, all of this has nothing to do with how we feel about you, okay?
We both love you very, very much, okay?
You and your sister will come first always.
Come on.
Let's try to see this in a positive light, okay?
Both of us.
Let's just buck up.
And I'll take you home.
Let me first just hit the old bathroom here.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
- Nice to meet you.
Saul Goodman.
- Nice to meet you.
You're not that lawyer on late-night television, are you?
Better call Saul!
I get it all the time.
We're here to discuss the sale of the property at 9809 Margo.
I get it.
Flat-fee clients, am I right?
Well, folks, today's your lucky day.
I represent a client who shall remain nameless.
However, for our purposes you might just as well visualise a large bag of money.
This individual wants to buy your house today for cash.
- Cash?
- Cash.
I know, in this economy.
The money is already burning a hole in my client's account.
You can ask Mr. Gardiner.
I've shown him all the pertinent financials.
It's the only reason we're sitting here.
Fair enough.
We get a few papers signed and notarised we can take care of this right now.
In fact, I could wire you your money this very afternoon.
There's just one little hair in the soup.
The price.
We feel 875 is very fair.
But I suppose there's always a little wiggle room.
Well, why don't you wiggle us on down to 400 and you got yourselves a deal?
Four hundred thousand?
What is that, a joke?
No, that's my offer.
That's less than half-price.
We put that much into the renovations alone.
Why don't we just cut the clown act and you tell us what you're willing to come up to?
Four hundred thousand.
That's my final offer.
- Waste of time.
- Ridiculous.
How could you possibly imagine we'd entertain this?
- Come on, hon.
- I don't know.
I thought some allowance was in order once I heard about the meth lab.
That used to be in the basement.
I looked over your signed disclosure statements and I don't see any mention of a meth lab.
Nope.
Oh, you got your termite inspection.
That's good.
But no meth lab.
Now, some would call that fraud in service of concealing a felony.
I, myself, am more open-minded.
But it is tricky.
Now, don't get me wrong.
I applaud your cojones.
I mean, good try at sneaking a meth-contaminated property past a buyer.
I mean, could've been a good deal for you.
Too bad.
Now, I could file a suit and encumber this property indefinitely.
Or I could start some criminal proceedings.
But I don't think any of us want that, now, do we?
How about it, counsellor?
Do you concur?
There you go, son.
Come on.
It's not Devil's Island.
Okay.
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.
- Brought pizza.
- Yeah.
Well, I'm making dinner.
Okay, I'll just put it in the fridge.

Hey, Mom, Dad.

The new owners are... expected at any moment.

There's something he should know about.
Hold on.

Good morning, Officer.
Sir, can you turn the music down?
Oh, yeah.
All right. [volume lowered]
Down means off.
Of course.
Okay. [radio off]
You know why I pulled you over this morning?
Well, I'm-
- I'm pretty sure I wasn't speeding.
I've been using the cruise control, so I--
No, sir.
Your windshield.
License and registration, please.
Right.
Uh...
This-
- This was from Wayfarer 515.
Um, my house was in the debris field.
Okay.
Uh, and that's-- that's what shattered my windshield-- some piece of wreckage from the plane.
I understand.
Yoknow of-- of Flight 515, the plane crash?
You're wearing the ribbon.

Sir, what you need to do is take a deep breath, calm down This is America.
and get back in that car now.
I have rights.
Do you understand that?
At least have the common decency to hear me out.
I need you to step back right now.
Did you even hear what I said?
Sir, calm down.
Now you're giving me a ticket?
I told you that my house was in the debris field.
Do you have the remotest inkling of what that means?
Sir, calm down.
Hellfire rained down on my house
Sir, I need you to step back now.
where my children sleep!
There were body parts in my yard!
Sir, this is your last warning.
You gotta be kidding me!
You got about two seconds to stand down, or I'm gonna pepper spray you.
You're gonna pepper spray?
Perfect!
That is just perfect!
Pepper spray the man who's expressing his opinion under the First Amendment!
[groaning] [police radio chatter] [door closes]
[Hank] Lastly, a little something from down El Paso way.
Border Patrol came across multiple homicides just this side of the border.
Truck turn out to be a chicken run out of Juarez and Laredo.
Border Patrol's been playing hide-and-seek with these polleros for two years.
But this time, as soon as they made it acro, someone hit them-- hit them hard.
We're talking a driver and nine illegals.
No sign of the shooters.
This truck was carrying more than just people.
What are we looking at?
Weed, coke, or meth?
Nah.
Doesn't look like they were transporting narcotics.
So, why did the Border Patrol kick this to us?
They didn't.

We're waiting on that famous blue meth of yours.
29 days since we saw it last.
Yeah, well, it's still out there, Gomie.
Don't worry. [phone ringing]
Local PD.
I gotta take this.
Gomie, go beat your piñata.
Rest of you jokers- too d--- quiet in here.
Go catch some bad guys.
Schrader.
Hey, what's up, Paul?
What?
[tool whirring] [hammer banging]
[muttering]
Jesse?
Hey, Dad.
So you're fixing up the house, huh?
Doing a little work, yeah.
Uh, I'll bounce.
It's-
- It's cool.
You doing okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.
I just happened to be driving by and saw the sign.
So, you're selling the place.
[chuckles] In this market.
Can you believe it?
I see you moved the garage.
That's bold.
Your mother's idea.
It's quite an operation.
We did, all new stucco, all the master suite, sandblasted, fumigated the basement...
Right on.
Yeah.
Fixing up the place totally increases resale value.
I read that in- I want to say, like,
Time magazine.
So, what'd you do with the upstairs bathroom?
All redone.
New tiles in the bathrooms and kitchens, granite countertops, new appliances-- all top of the line.
D---.
That's great, Dad.
Think, uh, I can get a tour?
Eh, these guys are trying to finish up.
Maybe we'd better stay out of their way.
There are pictures on the Web site, if you wanna take a look.

Never been in trouble a day of his life.
Found out he's got lung cancer, and now his wife kicks the poor b------ out of his own house.
I mean, look, guys, if anybody rates a little slack, here's the guy.
[sighs]
Hey, Walt, uh, you remember Officer Cavanaugh?
Officer, I'm very sorry that I lost my tper.
There's no excuse for my behavior.
It was disrespectful.
[muttering]
She's divorcing me.
Oh, I don't know what to tell you, buddy.
It is what it is.
She doesn't want me to see the kids.
She said that?
Yeah.
[engine starts] [seat belt alarm dinging]
You don't write?
You don't call?
G--.
It's a disaster.
It is not a disaster.
Oh, okay.
It's not a disaster, all right?
She's not going to the cops.
She's not gonna tell a living soul.
You wanna know why?
One word:
"blowback."
[chuckles] If she blabs, it'll be a disaster for her.
That DEA brother-in-law?
Whew!
Screwed.
You were right under his nose.
He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue-sniffers at the hobby shop.
The kids-
- Paging Dr. Phil.
My daddy's a drug dealer, and my mommy turned him in.
And the house-- gone.
The feds will come and RICO her and the kids out on the street.
Ooh, good luck arguing with them on that.
No.
It's not gonna happen.
She's bluffing, and she knows it.
Her going to the police is not the point, Saul.
She's out of my life.
Do you understand?
I've lost my family, everything that I care about.
Hey, buddy, [chuckles] uh, it's bad.
All right...
It's a calamity, but we live to fight another day.
And after a decent interval of time, well, [sighs] there are other fish in the sea.
You've been out of circulation for a while.
I mean, you'll be just amazed at what's out there.
Thailand, the Czech Republic...
I mean, those women are so grateful to even be here.
In the meantime, idle hands are the devil's playthings, so, uh, you should get back on the horse and do what you do best.
First step: talk to our friend and get cooking.
I can't be the bad guy.
What?
I can't be the bad guy.
Okay. [chuckling]
Uh...
You know, we'll, uh-- we'll revisit.
Just, uh, promise me you won't hang yourself in the closet.
[chuckles]
[sighs] [bell ringing]
Pop-pop!
Pop-pop, the ice-cream man!
Ohh...
Huh?
[chuckles]
Don't tell your mom.
Okay.
[phone ringing]
Yeah. [Saul] It's me.
We may have a wife problem.
Uh-huh.
Look, I need eyes on it.
You got an address?
Hey, dinner's gonna be late.
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie are bringing takeout.
But, uh, if you're hungry, I could rustle something up.
* [continues]
Okay.
[chopsticks clicking]
Hey, buddy, pass the ketchup, will you?
What?
I've had enough trans fat for one lifetime.
A two-day drive from the nearest ocean, and you're eating raw fish.
That's all I'm saying.
Mmm.
Been a while since that minnow been swimming.
Right, buddy?
[laughing]
You know, um, Flynn, uh, here is looking for a part-time job, so...
I don't know.
If you know of anything, you might wanna--
My-
- My name's Walter Jr.
Like-
- Like--
What, you-- you can't even say his name?
Um, if you've changed your mind about being called Flynn, all you need to do is just tell me that you don't want to be called Flynn.
You know what?
Dad didn't even show up till fourth period, and his eyes were all red like he'd been crying or something.
But you-- you don't even care.
And now, he won't even drive me home.
He won't say why, but I know it's because you told him not to.
Honey, I-
- What?
I don't know what your problem is.
You may not love him anymore, but I do.
I mean, why you gotta be--
Why-
- Why you gotta be such a-- a b----?
Hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no.
Oh...
Hank-
- Hank-
- Hank-- You don't talk to your mom that way.
It's-
- It's-
- It's all right.
Hey.
Hey. [door slams]
Skyler, I know that you must have your reasons for...all of this.
I...
Sky, uh, [clears throat]
I-
- I know it's none of my business, but, uh, keeping Walt from the kids...
[muttering]
You're right, Hank.
It's none of your business.
[quietly] Oh, my G--.
After all of that, please tell me that you are still not curious.
There's nothing to be curious about.
[scoffs] Please.
The day I heard there was a second cell phone, I knew.
Believe me.
I've seen it a hundred times.
Okay.
All right.
So, what?
Stop dancing around it.
What is it exactly that you have seen a hundred times?
Please, please, enlighten me.
Look, a guy like Walt-- a nice guy, decent, smart, you know?
Let's face it-- underachiever, dead-end life, okay?
He gets cancer.
Time's running out.
Midlife crisis.
He acts up.
Steps out.
Then the wife-- she catches him.
I mean, it's a story as old as time.
Look, do the math, Marie.
Only comes out one way.
Knowing Walt, he, uh, felt so guilty, he probably told her himself.
Yeah, I-- [mutters]
I don't know.
I think... if he cheated on her, that she would've told me by now.
It just feels like... something more.
[car alarm chirps]
Yes, yes, yes. 24-7 coverage.
Need you ask?
How much is this gonna run me?
[laughs]
J----.
I'm in the wrong business.
Yeah.
I'll call you. [phone beeps]
Return of the prodigal.
Welcome back to the land of the living.
How you feeling?
I'm good.
Of course you are.
The world's your oyster.
Am I right?
Unencumbered young man with, uh, stacks of cash.
Hey, I'm, uh-
- I'm jealous.
Hand to G--, I'm jealous.
Yeah, speaking of cash, uh, you know what's giving me heartburn lately?
Your former partner.
This guy...
He works like a b------, right?
Builds a business, single-handed.
Finally, the big money shows up, and what does he do?
He walks out.
Talent like that, and he just flushes it down the crapper.
It's like Michelangelo won't paint. [laughs]
Look, I know you're out of it and all, but you-- you wouldn't talk to him, would you?
I mean, help him pull his head out of his a--?
He won't listen to me, he's not gonna listen to you, all due respect.
You want a job?
A job?
Who's got a job for me?
I do.
[Woman on TV] Okay, let's see some jokers.
I used to be an English teacher, so I'd better take grammar for 100.
[applause]
All right.
Child stars for 100.
[breathing heavily]
[bell dings]
[scribbling]
[dings] [heavy breathing continues]
[bell continues dinging]
Hi.
Hey.
Thought I'd, uh, well, visit, if you don't mind.
No, of course not.
You don't, uh...
You don't need the room, do you?
No.
I just needed some more space to spread out.
Just wanted to say hello to little Holly here.
Hey, girl.
Hi.
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay. [fussing]
Oh, yeah.
She is a beauty.
Look at her.
Hey, thanks for being so flexible on me coming in.
Well, I just wish we had you back full time.
You do brighten up the place.
Listen, believe me, this is, uh... [sighs] I don't wanna bring this up, but I-
- I can't sign off on these quarterlies.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
Is that right?
If you're gonna do this, Ted, you can't be so glaring about it.
[chuckles]
Glaring.
Okay.
That does sound bad.
Uh, show me what's bothering you.
Keller.
No.
Again...
G--, I'm sorry.
I know how you feel about this.
Revenue with no backup.
Here, here, and here.
I don't even know what to say.
Yeah.
Um...
Yeah, well, uh...
Okay.
This is- This is fixable, right?
How about if I just push, uh, 28,800, um, out of this into next quarter?
Would you sign it then?
I'm--
I'm just saying
I can't sign it as it currently exists.
Fair enough.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you for the heads-up.
Well, you won't have to deal with this again,
I swear.
What if your kids found out?
If my kids found out?
This-- what you're doing.
I mean, someday, they're gonna be old enough.
How would you explain it to them?
[chuckles] Well-
- Wow.
Put me on the spot, why don't you?
I guess maybe I'd, um--
I'd say that, uh, I might have feet of clay that--
But that whatever I did, I did thinking of them.
You know?
Trying to provide.
And, uh, I'd ask them to try to take the time to understand... [chuckles]
You know what?
Truth is,
I haven't thought that far ahead, Skyler.
I'm just trying to keep my head above water, so...
I better get back to it.
[door closes] [cell phone buzzing] [sighs] Oh, G--.
Hi, Walt.
Listen.
I'm-
- I can't talk- I'm at work right now.
What?
Louis dropped him off.
He was here when I got home.
No, no, no.
Of course.
No.
He's not staying.
He understands that.
I'll-
- I'll bring him anywhere you want.
Dad...
Well, yeah, it is rush hour.
I mean, I could fight traffic and bring him down to Beneke now, but wouldn't it be easier if we...
Right.
Okay.
Good.
So we'll meet you at the house.
Okay.
Bye.
W-Why are you doing this?
She's just trying to k-keep me from seeing you, and you're helping her.
No.
No, son.
I mean, your-- your mother-- she has her reasons.
What reasons?
They're, uh...
Well, they're...
Well, they're just a little difficult to delineate, but--
I mean, yes, there are two sides to every story.
Always.
But, uh, she, uh...
Yeah.
This is just how it has to be.
For now.
Okay?
And, look, your home is your home, and that is where you belong, okay?
But it's where you belong.
Dad, it-- it's your house.
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie-- everybody knows that you hen't done anything wrong.
Everybody is on your side.
Well, it's-- it's-- it's not about taking sides, though.
How can-
- How can you let her treat you like this?
Now, come on.
How-
- How--
How can you just-- just take it?
Just listen to me, okay?
No matter what, all of this has nothing to do with how we feel about you, okay?
We both love you very, very much, okay?
You and your sister will come first, always.
Hmm?
Now, come on.
Let's, uh...
Let's try to see this in a positive light, okay?
Both of us.
Let's just buck up.
[sighs] Then I'll take you home.
Uh, let me first just hit the old bathroom.
* [hums]
[clears throat] Hello.
Good afternoon.
Nice to meet you.
Saul Goodman.
Nice to meet you.
You're not that lawyer on late-night television, are you?
Better call Saul!
[chuckles] [laughing]
I get it all the time.
We're here to discuss the sale of the property at 9809 Margo.
I get it.
Flat-fee clients.
Am I right?
Well, folks, today's your lucky day.
I represent a client who shall remain nameless.
However, for our purposes, you might just as well visualize a large bag of money.
This individual wants to buy your use today, for cash.
Cash?
Cash.
I know.
In this economy.
In fact, the money is already burning a hole in my client's account.
You can ask Mr. Gardiner.
I've shown him all the pertinent financials.
It the only reason we're sitting here.
Fair enough.
We, uh, get a few papers signed and notarized, we can take care of this right now.
In fact, I can wire you your money this very afternoon.
There's just one little hair in the soup-- uh, the price.
We feel 875 is very fair.
But I suppose there's always a little, uh, wiggle room.
Well, you wiggle us on down to 400, and you got yourselves a deal.
400,0?
What is that, a joke?
No, that's my offer.
That's less than half price.
We put almost that much into the renovations alone.
Why don't we just cut the clown act and you tell us what you're willing to come up to?
400,000.
That's my final offer.
Well, this is a waste of time.
Ridiculous.
How could you possibly imagine that we would entertain this?
Come on, hon.
I don't know.
I just thought some allowance was in order once I heard about the meth lab.
The one that used to be in the basement.
I looked over your signed disclosure statements, and I don't see any mention of a meth lab.
No.
No.
Oh, you got your termite inspection.
That's good.
But no meth lab.
Now, some would call that fraud in service of concealing a felony.
I, myself, am more open-minded.
But it is tricky.
Don't get me wrong.
I applaud your c------.
I mean, good try in sneaking a meth-contaminated property past the buyer.
I mean, you know, could've been a good deal for you.
Too bad.
Now, I uid file a suit and encumber this property indefinitely, or I could start some criminal proceedings.
But I don't think any of us want that now, do we?
How about it, counselor?
Do you concur?
* [hums] [grunts]
Ta-da.
Here you go, son.
Come on.
It's not Devil's Island.
[grunts]
Okay.
Ooh.
Here we go.
Oh.
Hey. [chuckles]
Hello.
Ah.
Uh, mmm.
Brought pizza.
Yeah.
Well, I'm making dinner.
Oh, okay.
I'll just, uh, put it in the fridge.
It's even better the next day, huh?
Hi, honey.
Uh...
Sorry.
Yeah.
All right.
Skyler...
Honey, what kind of example do we want to set here?
Right?
I mean, can't we at least just sit down and eat a piece of pizza together?
Just to hash things out like adults?
You know--
We have...discussed everything we ne to discuss.
I thought I made myself very clear.
I got dipping sticks.
[yells, huffs]
[groaning]
[phone ringing]
[groaning continues] [ringing continues]
[Walt on machine] You've reached Walt's temporary number.
Please leave a message. [spitting] [beeps]
[Skyler on machine] When I went out this morning to get the newspaper,
I saw a pizza on our roof.
Would you know anything about that?
Listen to me, Walt.
You need to control yourself.
Calm down, accept the situation, and keep your distance.
If you can't manage that,
I will get a restraining order.
[beeps] [yells] [groans]
Skyler.
Skyler.
I got your restraining order right here!
Restrain this!
Oh. [groans] [groans]
Oh, yeah.
[grunting]
Breaking even's not so bad.
In this economy, a lot of people would kill to break even.
Poor Jake.
He had his heart set on going to space camp.
[car approaching] [sighs] Oh, no.
Oh, G--.
This is all we need.
[both sigh]
Hey, Mom, Dad.
How's it going?
Uh, Jesse, it's, uh, really not a good time.
Jesse, the house has been sold.
The new owners are expected at any moment.
Where do you think you're going?
Inside.
I bought the place.
[door closes]
Be back by 7, okay?
I love you.
[car door closes]
Bye. [car departs] [engine starts]
[tool whirring]
Ahh!
Jeez.
[bangs]
[mutters]
[coughs]
Come on.
[groans]
[grunting]
[coughing] [spitting]
Oh, G--!
[grunting]
Ahh!
[coughing]
[pounding]
[grunting]
[groaning]
Oh, s---
- No!
[groaning]
Oh, G--.

Good morning, Officer.
Sir, can you turn the music down?
Oh, yeah.
All right.
Down means off.
Of course.
Okay.
You know why I pulled you over this morning?
Well, I'm
- I'm pretty sure I wasn't speeding.
I've been using the cruise control, so I-
No, sir.
Your windshield.
License and registration, please.
Right.
Uh...
This
- This was from Wayfarer 515.
Um, my house was in the debris field.
Okay.
Uh, and that's- that's what shattered my windshield- some piece of wreckage from the plane.
I understand.
Yoknow of- of Flight 515, the plane crash?
You're wearing the ribbon.
Yes, sir.
I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515.
I was one of the first responders on the scene that day.
Then what are you doing?
Citing you, sir.
What?
What, you don't believe me?
Sir, regardless of how that windshield was damaged, this car is unsafe to drive in this condition.
Stay in the car, please.
Wait.
Wait just a minute.
Just one minute.
Sir, I asked you to stay in the vehicle.
No, no, no.
I can get out of my own car.
Sir, listen-
No, no, no.
You listen to me.
It's time for you to listen to me.
Sir, what you need to do is take a deep breath, calm down This is America.
and get back in that car now.
I have rights.
Do you understand that?
At least have the common decency to hear me out.
I need you to step back right now.
Did you even hear what I said?
Sir, calm down.
Now you're giving me a ticket?
I told you that my house was in the debris field.
Do you have the remotest inkling of what that means?
Sir, calm down.
Hellfire rained down on my house
Sir, I need you to step back now.
where my children sleep!
There were body parts in my yard!
Sir, this is your last warning.
You gotta be kidding me!
You got about two seconds to stand down, or I'm gonna pepper spray you.
You're gonna pepper spray?
Perfect!
That is just perfect!
Pepper spray the man who's expressing his opinion under the First Amendment!
Lastly, a little something from down El Paso way.
Border Patrol came across multiple homicides just this side of the border.
Truck turn out to be a chicken run out of Juarez and Laredo.
Border Patrol's been playing hide-and-seek with these polleros for two years.
But this time, as soon as they made it acro, someone hit them- hit them hard.
We're talking a driver and nine illegals.
No sign of the shooters.
This truck was carrying more than just people.
What are we looking at?
Weed, coke, or meth?
Nah.
Doesn't look like they were transporting narcotics.
So, why did the Border Patrol kick this to us?
They didn't.
I pulled it.
You ask me, ths high-end cartel work.
Los Zetas, maybe.
Question is, why do we have Juarez-style action on our side of the DMZ?
They sending a message or clearing a path?
Or was this about stopping one particular border-hopper?
Maybe one of those extra-crispies knew something he shouldn't.
Anyway, keep your eyes open.
All right.
That's it.
Slow news day.
Add one more to the countdown.
Oh, yeah?
What's that, Gomie?
We're waiting on that famous blue meth of yours.
29 days since we saw it last.
Yeah, well, it's still out there, Gomie.
Don't worry.
Local PD.
I gotta take this.
Gomie, go beat your piÃ±ata.
Rest of you jokers- too d- - quiet in here.
Go catch some bad guys.
Schrader.
Hey, what's up, Paul?
What?
Jesse?
Hey, Dad.
So you're fixing up the house, huh?
Doing a little work, yeah.
Uh, I'll bounce.
It's
- It's cool.
You doing okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.
I just happened to be driving by and saw the sign.
So, you're selling the place.
In this market.
Can you believe it?
I see you moved the garage.
That's bold.
Your mother's idea.
It's quite an operation.
We did, all new stucco, all the master suite, sandblasted, fumigated the basement...
Right on.
Yeah.
Fixing up the place totally increases resale value.
I read that in- I want to say, like,
Time magazine.
So, what'd you do with the upstairs bathroom?
All redone.
New tiles in the bathrooms and kitchens, granite countertops, new appliances- all top of the line.
D. That's great, Dad.
Think, uh, I can get a tour?
Eh, these guys are trying to finish up.
Maybe we'd better stay out of their way.
There are pictures on the Web site, if you wanna take a look.
Cool.
You're looking healthy.
I'll tell your mother.
She'll be happy.
Thanks.
You know, I could come by sometime for, uh, dinner or something.
Yeah.
Sometime.
Okay.
Later, Dad.
You know, look, he's a high school teacher over at Wynne.
Never been in trouble a day of his life.
Found out he's got lung cancer, and now his wife kicks the poor b- out of his own house.
I mean, look, guys, if anybody rates a little slack, here's the guy.
Hey, Walt, uh, you remember Officer Cavanaugh?
Officer, I'm very sorry that I lost my tper.
There's no excuse for my behavior.
It was disrespectful.
She's divorcing me.
Oh, I don't know what to tell you, buddy.
It is what it is.
She doesn't want me to see the kids.
She said that?
Yeah.
You don't write?
You don't call?
G.
It's a disaster.
It is not a disaster.
Oh, okay.
It's not a disaster, all right?
She's not going to the cops.
She's not gonna tell a living soul.
You wanna know why?
One word:
"blowback. "
If she blabs, it'll be a disaster for her.
That DEA brother-in-law?
Whew!
Screwed.
You were right under his nose.
He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue-sniffers at the hobby shop.
The kids
- Paging Dr. Phil.
My daddy's a drug dealer, and my mommy turned him in.
And the house- gone.
The feds will come and RICO her and the kids out on the street.
Ooh, good luck arguing with them on that.
No.
It's not gonna happen.
She's bluffing, and she knows it.
Her going to the police is not the point, Saul.
She's out of my life.
Do you understand?
I've lost my family, everything that I care about.
Hey, buddy, uh, it's bad.
All right...
It's a calamity, but we live to fight another day.
And after a decent interval of time, well, there are other fish in the sea.
You've been out of circulation for a while.
I mean, you'll be just amazed at what's out there.
Thailand, the Czech Republic...
I mean, those women are so grateful to even be here.
In the meantime, idle hands are the devil's playthings, so, uh, you should get back on the horse and do what you do best.
First step: talk to our friend and get cooking.
I can't be the bad guy.
What?
I can't be the bad guy.
Okay.
Uh...
You know, we'll, uh- we'll revisit.
Just, uh, promise me you won't hang yourself in the closet.
Pop-pop!
Pop-pop, the ice-cream man!
Ohh...
Huh?
Don't tell your mom.
Okay.
Yeah.
It's me.
We may have a wife problem.
Uh-huh.
Look, I need eyes on it.
You got an address?
Hey, dinner's gonna be late.
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie are bringing takeout.
But, uh, if you're hungry, I could rustle something up.
*
Okay.
Hey, buddy, pass the ketchup, will you?
What?
I've had enough trans fat for one lifetime.
A two-day drive from the nearest ocean, and you're eating raw fish.
That's all I'm saying.
Mmm.
Been a while since that minnow been swimming.
Right, buddy?
You know, um, Flynn, uh, here is looking for a part-time job, so...
I don't know.
If you know of anything, you might wanna-
My
- My name's Walter Jr.
Like
- Like-
What, you- you can't even say his name?
Um, if you've changed your mind about being called Flynn, all you need to do is just tell me that you don't want to be called Flynn.
You know what?
Dad didn't even show up till fourth period, and his eyes were all red like he'd been crying or something.
But you- you don't even care.
And now, he won't even drive me home.
He won't say why, but I know it's because you told him not to.
Honey, I
- What?
I don't know what your problem is.
You may not love him anymore, but I do.
I mean, why you gotta be-
Why
- Why you gotta be such a- a b-?
Hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no.
Oh...
Hank
- Hank
- Hank- You don't talk to your mom that way.
It's
- It's
- It's all right.
Hey.
Hey.
Skyler, I know that you must have your reasons for... all of this.
I...
Sky, uh,
I
- I know it's none of my business, but, uh, keeping Walt from the kids...
You're right, Hank.
It's none of your business.
Oh, my G-.
After all of that, please tell me that you are still not curious.
There's nothing to be curious about.
Please.
The day I heard there was a second cell phone, I knew.
Believe me.
I've seen it a hundred times.
Okay.
All right.
So, what?
Stop dancing around it.
What is it exactly that you have seen a hundred times?
Please, please, enlighten me.
Look, a guy like Walt- a nice guy, decent, smart, you know?
Let's face it- underachiever, dead-end life, okay?
He gets cancer.
Time's running out.
Midlife crisis.
He acts up.
Steps out.
Then the wife- she catches him.
I mean, it's a story as old as time.
Look, do the math, Marie.
Only comes out one way.
Knowing Walt, he, uh, felt so guilty, he probably told her himself.
Yeah, I-
I don't know.
I think... if he cheated on her, that she would've told me by now.
It just feels like... something more.
Yes, yes, yes. 24-7 coverage.
Need you ask?
How much is this gonna run me?
J. I'm in the wrong business.
Yeah.
I'll call you.
Return of the prodigal.
Welcome back to the land of the living.
How you feeling?
I'm good.
Of course you are.
The world's your oyster.
Am I right?
Unencumbered young man with, uh, stacks of cash.
Hey, I'm, uh
- I'm jealous.
Hand to G-, I'm jealous.
Yeah, speaking of cash, uh, you know what's giving me heartburn lately?
Your former partner.
This guy...
He works like a b-, right?
Builds a business, single-handed.
Finally, the big money shows up, and what does he do?
He walks out.
Talent like that, and he just flushes it down the crapper.
It's like Michelangelo won't paint.
Look, I know you're out of it and all, but you- you wouldn't talk to him, would you?
I mean, help him pull his head out of his a-?
He won't listen to me, he's not gonna listen to you, all due respect.
You want a job?
A job?
Who's got a job for me?
I do.
Okay, let's see some jokers.
I used to be an English teacher, so I'd better take grammar for 100.
All right.
Child stars for 100.
Hi.
Hey.
Thought I'd, uh, well, visit, if you don't mind.
No, of course not.
You don't, uh...
You don't need the room, do you?
No.
I just needed some more space to spread out.
Just wanted to say hello to little Holly here.
Hey, girl.
Hi.
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
Oh, yeah.
She is a beauty.
Look at her.
Hey, thanks for being so flexible on me coming in.
Well, I just wish we had you back full time.
You do brighten up the place.
Listen, believe me, this is, uh...
I don't wanna bring this up, but I
- I can't sign off on these quarterlies.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
Is that right?
If you're gonna do this, Ted, you can't be so glaring about it.
Glaring.
Okay.
That does sound bad.
Uh, show me what's bothering you.
Keller.
No.
Again...
G, I'm sorry.
I know how you feel about this.
Revenue with no backup.
Here, here, and here.
I don't even know what to say.
Yeah.
Um...
Yeah, well, uh...
Okay.
This is- This is fixable, right?
How about if I just push, uh, 28,800, um, out of this into next quarter?
Would you sign it then?
I'm-
I'm just saying
I can't sign it as it currently exists.
Fair enough.
I'll take care of it.
Thank you for the heads-up.
Well, you won't have to deal with this again,
I swear.
What if your kids found out?
If my kids found out?
This- what you're doing.
I mean, someday, they're gonna be old enough.
How would you explain it to them?
Well
- Wow.
Put me on the spot, why don't you?
I guess maybe I'd, um-
I'd say that, uh, I might have feet of clay that-
But that whatever I did, I did thinking of them.
You know?
Trying to provide.
And, uh, I'd ask them to try to take the time to understand...
You know what?
Truth is,
I haven't thought that far ahead, Skyler.
I'm just trying to keep my head above water, so...
I better get back to it.
Oh, G-.
Hi, Walt.
Listen.
I'm
- I can't talk- I'm at work right now.
What?
Louis dropped him off.
He was here when I got home.
No, no, no.
Of course.
No.
He's not staying.
He understands that.
I'll
- I'll bring him anywhere you want.
Dad...
Well, yeah, it is rush hour.
I mean, I could fight traffic and bring him down to Beneke now, but wouldn't it be easier if we...
Right.
Okay.
Good.
So we'll meet you at the house.
Okay.
Bye.
W
- Why are you doing this?
She's just trying to k- keep me from seeing you, and you're helping her.
No.
No, son.
I mean, your- your mother- she has her reasons.
What reasons?
They're, uh...
Well, they're...
Well, they're just a little difficult to delineate, but-
I mean, yes, there are two sides to every story.
Always.
But, uh, she, uh...
Yeah.
This is just how it has to be.
For now.
Okay?
And, look, your home is your home, and that is where you belong, okay?
But it's where you belong.
Dad, it- it's your house.
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie- everybody knows that you hen't done anything wrong.
Everybody is on your side.
Well, it's- it's- it's not about taking sides, though.
How can
- How can you let her treat you like this?
Now, come on.
How
- How-
How can you just- just take it?
Just listen to me, okay?
No matter what, all of this has nothing to do with how we feel about you, okay?
We both love you very, very much, okay?
You and your sister will come first, always.
Hmm?
Now, come on.
Let's, uh...
Let's try to see this in a positive light, okay?
Both of us.
Let's just buck up.
Then I'll take you home.
Uh, let me first just hit the old bathroom.
*
Hello.
Good afternoon.
Nice to meet you.
Saul Goodman.
Nice to meet you.
You're not that lawyer on late-night television, are you?
Better call Saul!
I get it all the time.
We're here to discuss the sale of the property at 9809 Margo.
I get it.
Flat-fee clients.
Am I right?
Well, folks, today's your lucky day.
I represent a client who shall remain nameless.
However, for our purposes, you might just as well visualize a large bag of money.
This individual wants to buy your use today, for cash.
Cash?
Cash.
I know.
In this economy.
In fact, the money is already burning a hole in my client's account.
You can ask Mr. Gardiner.
I've shown him all the pertinent financials.
It the only reason we're sitting here.
Fair enough.
We, uh, get a few papers signed and notarized, we can take care of this right now.
In fact, I can wire you your money this very afternoon.
There's just one little hair in the soup- uh, the price.
We feel 875 is very fair.
But I suppose there's always a little, uh, wiggle room.
Well, you wiggle us on down to 400, and you got yourselves a deal.
400,0?
What is that, a joke?
No, that's my offer.
That's less than half price.
We put almost that much into the renovations alone.
Why don't we just cut the clown act and you tell us what you're willing to come up to?
400,000.
That's my final offer.
Well, this is a waste of time.
Ridiculous.
How could you possibly imagine that we would entertain this?
Come on, hon.
I don't know.
I just thought some allowance was in order once I heard about the meth lab.
The one that used to be in the basement.
I looked over your signed disclosure statements, and I don't see any mention of a meth lab.
No.
No.
Oh, you got your termite inspection.
That's good.
But no meth lab.
Now, some would call that fraud in service of concealing a felony.
I, myself, am more open-minded.
But it is tricky.
Don't get me wrong.
I applaud your c-.
I mean, good try in sneaking a meth-contaminated property past the buyer.
I mean, you know, could've been a good deal for you.
Too bad.
Now, I uid file a suit and encumber this property indefinitely, or I could start some criminal proceedings.
But I don't think any of us want that now, do we?
How about it, counselor?
Do you concur?
*
Ta-da.
Here you go, son.
Come on.
It's not Devil's Island.
Okay.
Ooh.
Here we go.
Oh.
Hey.
Hello.
Ah.
Uh, mmm.
Brought pizza.
Yeah.
Well, I'm making dinner.
Oh, okay.
I'll just, uh, put it in the fridge.
It's even better the next day, huh?
Hi, honey.
Uh...
Sorry.
Yeah.
All right.
Skyler...
Honey, what kind of example do we want to set here?
Right?
I mean, can't we at least just sit down and eat a piece of pizza together?
Just to hash things out like adults?
You know-
We have... discussed everything we ne to discuss.
I thought I made myself very clear.
I got dipping sticks.
You've reached Walt's temporary number.
Please leave a message.
When I went out this morning to get the newspaper,
I saw a pizza on our roof.
Would you know anything about that?
Listen to me, Walt.
You need to control yourself.
Calm down, accept the situation, and keep your distance.
If you can't manage that,
I will get a restraining order.
Skyler.
Skyler.
I got your restraining order right here!
Restrain this!
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Breaking even's not so bad.
In this economy, a lot of people would kill to break even.
Poor Jake.
He had his heart set on going to space camp.
Oh, no.
Oh, G-.
This is all we need.
Hey, Mom, Dad.
How's it going?
Uh, Jesse, it's, uh, really not a good time.
Jesse, the house has been sold.
The new owners are expected at any moment.
Where do you think you're going?
Inside.
I bought the place.
Be back by 7, okay?
I love you.
Bye.
Ahh!
Jeez.
Come on.
Oh, G-!
Ahh!
Oh, s
- No!
Oh, G-.

Master, I already know who can tell us where your sister is,... the wet-nurse.
No, no, Irene, no!
So you left her there,... waiting for me all alone?
I'll die of hunger before I'll sell my son.
Whoever wanted to kill Irene killed a servant instead.
Then you'll have to leave my house in a fortnight, and not a day more.
~ Arrest him!
~ Let me go!
I'm arresting you for murder.
First round for the town's donkey race.
You can win 100 reales, it's written down here!
Get off the donkey, Father!
Francisco Pulido is racing,... the village champion,... and no one ever beats him.
~ Where's Irene?
~ I don't know.
He won't let you hurt me.
It's better for you if she shows up alive.
The goldsmith has kidnapped Cardinal Mendoza's niece.
The one who grabbed the medallion?
I allowed myself to complete the scheme,... since it seems you forgot we're looking for a girl, not a boy.
Her name is Ana, she wore this bracelet.
I remember the girl.
A battalion from the front is arriving,... they're pretty beat up.
That's Juan's outfit.
Does anyone know Juan de Calatrava?
If I had someone like you waiting for me,... no one could kill me.
"I love you, Gonzalo."
This letter seem to be written by Margarita.
"I love you, Gonzalo."
Here she wrote "I love you, Gonzalo"...
No one looks for the living among the dead.
Will you deny a donkey to the Spanish Empire?
I'll soon make this bond public, and you'll live with me at the royal palace.
The Cardinal's niece could be lying dead somewhere.
We meet again once more.
They said you had an opening for the job of executioner.
Sátur!
~ Amelia Ayuso.
~ Here.
~ Francisca Gamboa.
~ Yes.
Come on, it gives me heart that we're going to get a letter.
You from Juan and me from Floro.
~ Asunción Manrique.
~ That's me.
~ Dolores Núñez.
~ Yes.
~ That's from the front?
~ Yes.
~ Josefa Castro.
~ Here.
~ Raymunda Esteban.
~ Me, me.
Juan Antonio Núñez.
That's them all, sorry.
You're sure?
Look once more, maybe with the grind of the road... one got hidden there.
Oh, no?
And what about these?
Employees of the crown are all alike.
Don't they care that they're just playing with the hopes of ordinary people?
It's letters no one has claimed, they've been here for a while.
Well, it's a pity when you send a letter and it doesn't arrive at its destination... all those kisses and hugs are lost.
Well, who sent it?
I'm desperate, since I don't know where to find something for Estuarda.
Look, everyone's the same, looking for a job... where none exists.
The seal was stamped by the Franciscans,... a certain someone named Augustín.
No, no, it's very bad taste to open other people's mail,... a letter is very intimate.
I already know it's intimate,... it was only to learn who he was,... it doesn't say on the outside, so maybe inside...
That's very ugly, Catalina, very ugly.
Look at that, Master, look.
It's dated the very day of Augustín's death.
"Royal hunting field", this handwriting is unreadable, Master!
"100 years old tree".
A bit more...
Again?
Red Eagle!
Master!
Red Eagle!
He's here.
What a scare you gave me!
It's that.
Such good eyesight you have, I would not have seen the drawing even if it had bitten me.
Don't stick your hand in,... unless you want to go without an arm!
I'm doing it.
This friar was a fool to hide something inside there, and in the royal hunting preserve.
Oh, and even more, to put it in a letter, given the state of the mail service...
I'm touching something, Master.
Something's that's snared me.
Master!
This may seem a bit strange, but... even in this weird pose, I...
I'm the guard of the forest.
Arrest him!
Let him go.
Don't do this to me ever again, Master!
I know you like the suspense, and to appear at the end,... but in the meantime I've got my heart in my mouth!
What thing is this thing?
A parchment.
Let's go!
Come in.
Your Eminence,... the commissioner.
Your Eminence.
I hope you have a good reason for interrupting me at my work, commissioner.
Of course, your Eminence...
I come to offer you an agreement,... which will benefit both of us.
Let's hear it.
As you advised me a while ago, for a man in my situation... it would be convenient to form a family.
Well, I'd like to be part of yours.
I want the hand of your niece Irene.
You shouldn't drink so early,... it's not a good habit, commissioner.
Don't be afraid, I only do it at mass.
Then how dare you interrupt me,... with such an outlandish proposal?
I thought you might be interested on something I wanted to offer in exchange.
Good day, your Eminence.
All right, tell me.
Where did you find this?
The goldsmith who kidnapped Irene had it.
You know that a simple gesture would bring me men pouring through the door?
I know,... that's why I haven't come alone.
Think it over, your Eminence, as this jewelry is rather too ostentatious for me.
But besides that, I don't know what value it might have for you.
And all you want is my niece's hand?
And the means to support her in the style which she deserves.
The wedding will take place within three days,... then you'll hand over the medallion.
Your Eminence.
Hi.
Hi.
Ah, what a crappy visage!
You didn't sleep well?
Well, not much, Dad,... not with Aunt Margarita spending the whole night crying.
The poor lady meant to do it softly, but she failed.
I heard her, too, Son.
Dad, you should try to help her out more,...
I don't know, keep her company, talk about things,...
I don't know, Son,... maybe your aunt doesn't want to share certain things with me.
But why wouldn't she want to, she's a woman!
?
True, we men never say anything, but women,... but women chatter all the time, remember my mother?
~ Hi.
~ Hi.
I'll get to work very late, so I won't even have breakfast, all right?
Aunt Margarita, Dad says he wouldn't mind going with you to the palace today, right?
Don't take the trouble, Gonzalo.
No, no problem,... before going to school, I have to look for some specimens, and it's on my way.
Shall we go?
Oh, Dad, if you're a bit late, don't get worried, I'll keep the school in order.
Thanks.
I can't, Sátur, as much as I'd like to use Estuarda,... here there's no work even for myself, not even a single soul comes in to the inn.
But have you seen me?
I have to cut roots so that Gabi has something to put in his mouth.
He's a child, not an anteater!
Besides, you've always had someone helping you keep the inn, Cipri.
Not just a "someone", Sátur, my wife,... but thanks for reminding me.
We're hungry, please, we're hungry.
Bless me, Father,...
Help us, your Highness.
~ Cipri...
~ Innkeeper!
Innkeeper!
The bishop is looking for a serious and respectful woman for the job of housekeeper in his home,... do you know of anyone suitable?
No, I'm sorry, sister,..
at the moment no one crosses my mind.
Very well, but if you think of someone, let me know.
You call yourself a friend?
Why didn't you recommend Estuarda?
Get serious, Sátur, she said they were looking for a serious and respectful woman.
Yeah, so what?
Well, in a bishop's house, Estuarda is...
She's what?
What is Estuarda, hey?
It's not for me to say, Sátur, please.
To be a prostitute is a job, not an ailment, Cipri.
Your problem's that... you haven't had any necessity in your life,... you don't know what it is to be hungry.
Hungry, no, but with lots of hardship.
She's expected this evening at the bishop's house.
I'm concerned that you still don't walk very well, Nuño.
With all respect, ma'am, with the injury he has... we should give thanks to God that we can see him as healthy as he is.
Irene!
Your Eminence.
Has something happened to your niece, is there any bad news?
No, no, not at all.
A wedding is always a great event, don't you think?
Irene's getting married?
~ Well, yes.
~ Well, who's the lucky guy?
Me.
~ No.
~ Shut up, Nuño.
But you can't marry her.
Nuño, retire this instant.
Catalina, go with him.
Let's go, young Master.
Children have their illusions now and then,... and they say things off the top of their head which they don't really mean.
And with regards to the bond: congratulations, commissioner, that's great news.
It is that.
It's certainly excellent news for everyone.
Good, but now if your permit,...
I have to return to my duties.
~ Your Eminence.
~ Commissioner.
I don't get why you're looking at me like that, Lucrecia,... isn't this exactly what you wanted?
I only suggested that it would be great business,... otherwise I couldn't care less.
You're jealous.
To be jealous, I would have to be in love with you.
What I don't understand is how you could pull this off without my help.
Not everyone in the world regards me as worthless as you do.
That's because they don't know you.
Good day.
Why are you laughing?
Well, it seems strange to see you here,... but thanks for coming with me.
Yeah, well, I already had to go to collect minerals, and...
Yeah, and making good use of the coincidence of me going the same way, then...
Of course.
Margarita, it's that...
Maybe I haven't been very attentive, and I should have said long before now,... well, you know you can count on me for whatever you may need.
Or even simply to chat.
You have too many problems, Gonzalo,... and besides, you've never been much of one to talk,... you're more used to carrying everything inside yourself.
Inside...right.
I mean you find it hard to relate your feelings freely,... you've got too much self-control.
Come on, you're not very spontaneous, as we say.
Oh, really?
No, but don't take offense,...
So you say I'm hardly spontaneous at all.
Right, then I challenge you to a race to that tree,... and besides that, I'll give you a head start!
I don't need head start.
I've won you.
Because I let you win.
To be sure.
A knife.
What does it say, Gonzalo?
The third infantry company... has fallen into the hands of the Portuguese.
That's Juan's company.
They're demanding a ransom from the king for their release.
I don't yield to blackmail.
It's the company of your cousin, Juan de Calatrava.
I know.
His death and those of the rest of the prisoners would be a small price to pay... for the good of the kingdom.
That's what war is.
I'll send a messenger with your response.
The king has been informed,... and you may leave.
Will he do something?
Sir, does that he means to let those men die?
Guards!
I can leave by myself.
Your Majesty, please, don't leave those men to die.
Please!
Who dares tell the king what he has to do?
!
With all respect, your Majesty,...
I'm Gonzalo de Montalvo.
I, Felipe de Austria,... take you, Laura de Montignac, as my lawfully wedded wife.
Their royal Highnesses Hernán, Gonzalo:, the rings.
Soon I'll make this bond public and you'll live with me in the palace.
Let him go.
Estuarda, close up your neckline,...
But what neckline do you mean?
I'm clothed to my very ears!
This bishop is well-known for his charity but also for his morality.
If he should find out that you've dedicated your life to pleasure,... your stay in the palace won't even last for hours.
Relax, I'm not stupid,... can you imagine I'm going to tell him?
Stop wiggling, you have that sensual wiggling...
Better not walk.
But how could I not walk, Sátur, I'm here to serve.
I can't do it, as he'll soon figure out.
It'll all work out, you'll see.
Only don't flash him bedroom eyes, that's a sin.
I don't even resemble a decent woman,... since I've been "exercising" so much.
Estuarda, you are so high-spirited a woman,...
You're a mother from head to toe who does whatever she can to feed her little boy,... you can do this and a lot more, I assure you.
I don't know how you can be so proud of me, Sátur.
Go with God.
I believe you must be Estuarda?
Yes, sir, to serve both you and God.
You're going to start right now --- what are your skills?
Everything.
In all matters related to household tasks, of course.
And you, who are you?
I'm the one who has nominated her for the job, nothing else, and I'm leaving right now.
May God be with you.
Your Excellency.
You will tell us, sir, when you want us to start?
Right now.
With your permission, I'll stock up your firewood.
Are you all right?
No, I'm not,... and you shouldn't be, either,... if it's Irene who's important to you.
Has anything happened to Miss Irene?
Yes, it has: she's going to marry the commissioner, that's what... within three days.
Leave,...
I want to talk with my son.
You ought to learn to control your emotions in public,... you're a noble,... and the nobility simply drips composure.
The commissioner's going to marry someone else, and it's your fault!
Hernán made his own decisions.
Even if I wanted to, there's nothing I could do.
Yes, indeed, of course there's something you can do...
He spends his whole life with us.
If you'd ask him, he would have married you,... and he'd be my father.
He's not your father, Nuño.
Yes, indeed he is.
I don't have a single memory without him... and everything I know he's shown me... but now he's headed off,... and he'll have a real family,... his own sons,... he'll forget me.
But that hardly matters to you!
Dry your face,... and pull your socks up.
Never ever put us to shame again.
Come on, everybody get inside... and I'll tell you news, gossips!
Father, Father, has the king received you?
Good, well, that's not what's important --- instead, it's that he's promised to pay the ransom... so our soldiers will be set free.
~ Great!
~ Good, then you've saved Juan, you're a hero!
No, no, not a hero...
And how is the king?
Is it true he walks without touching the ground?
And does he have a halo like the saints?
Fool, how would he shine?
!
Kids, the king is a normal human,... he walks normally, he talks normally, and he eats normally.
He's a man, Dad, but not normal,... because he's the king.
Well, yes, he's the king.
Let's go.
To your seats, let's get the class going.
Gonzalo.
Yes?
Thanks!
That's enough of that.
I don't want even a whisper out of you.
Alonso, why doesn't your father marry your aunt?
Well, because he can't manage to forget my mom.
Your Highness, someone's here to see you.
That should be my friend Antonio who's traveling to Rome.
I'm coming out.
We're finished here!
Hey, Antonio, how are you?
Estuarda, come along,...
Bring me a letter from my desk that I've left there.
Yes.
What's up?
You know that woman's a whore?
What?
Yeah.
Your Highness.
Take this, Antonio, give it to the archbishop with my thanks.
~ Farewell.
~ Farewell.
Estuarda,... to what did you dedicate yourself before working in this home?
In truth I did a little of everything.
Of everything, like what?
Tell me.
My Lord Bishop, I need this job...
I know you're a good man.
You're a prostitute?
!
Please, don't throw me out, please... my son is dying of hunger.
God punishes sinners!
I don't believe that it's a sin to try to live in this world.
You're a bitch!
You'll be burned at the stake!
You're a whore!
Unclean!
Sinner!
What are you doing, don't touch her!
What have you done, Sátur?
You killed him!
A clasp of amethyst with an array of five diamonds.
I never thought I'd have to get rid of this piece.
Think, ma'am, that it's in a good cause... that necklace will save the lives of our men.
And which of these men are important to me?
I'm not doing it for them, but because of the king's decree.
A necklace of sapphire encrusted with gold.
It's hardly my fault that the royal coffers are empty... nor that the king manages the affairs of the kingdom with such ineptitude.
Ma'am, lower your voice, they can hear you.
Lucrecia.
If you're looking for your betrothed, she ought to be in the chapel, praying the vespers.
I'm not here to see her, I want to talk with you.
Leave us.
Ma'am.
What you're doing for your kingdom honors you, Lucrecia,
I know the king has asked for help from the nobility to help with the hostages.
And have you come to arrange to hand over your dowry?
I've come to settle something with you... there's no reason for us not to continue to do business together as usual.
I gave you that.
Oh, really?
I don't remember.
But now that you mention it, all the more reason to hand it over to your cause.
If you listen to me you won't have to do it.
It's very risky, but there's a lot to gain.
Yes?
Excuse me, ma'am, the royal guard has arrived to collect your contribution.
Your pardon, Hernán, if you'll excuse me, I have a lot to do.
Lucrecia.
Master?
Here, Sátur.
Master...
How have you hurt yourself, Sátur, what have you done?
I killed him.
Who?
I killed him.
I was out of control, I don't know what came over me.
Let's see, what about your killing him, and who was he?
The bishop, the town's bishop, he was slapping Estuarda.
~ Sit down.
~ She went there to work as a servant.
Tell me, Sátur, where did you dump the body?
The body --- where did you leave it?
In the bishop's house.
At last she'd found some honest work,... she only wanted a job, Master!
If it weren't for me this wouldn't have happened.
Does anyone else know you both were there?
No, no, not even Gabi.
She didn't want to tell him until the job was secure.
Are we going to hang?
No, Sátur, no.
Think things over.
And take off that shirt.
Take it off, I'm going now.
Sátur!
But, but what happened, why are you covered in blood?
!
No, this is nothing, I cut myself sharpening the scissors.
But, are you all right?
Let me help you.
Yes, no, no, no, it's very flamboyant,... but I'm fine.
Off to your room, come on, let's go.
Let's rest, come on and lie down, it's getting late.
Where do you think you're going, Martín?
Let me go in, please... they've told me that she's going to marry the commissioner,...
I have to talk with her.
~ Martín, it's for the best.
~ Best for who?
For everyone.
She'll get a wealthy husband, and she'll leave this house, and you'll forget her forever.
Not in 1,000 years, Aunt!
I beg you, let me talk with her,... just once.
Martín, you don't have to drag firewood into this room anymore.
Commissioner?
Isn't my fiancée in her chambers?
Yes, sir, with your permission.
Good night.
Miss.
I only wanted to tell you that I'm going to be a good husband, Irene.
What's going on?
What are you doing there, Estuarda?
Leave me alone.
Go on, beat it.
Go on, this is clean.
I'll finish grabbing this, get off!
What's he done to you?
Hamfists.
Estuarda, leave by the back door and don't let anyone see you.
And now what, Master?
And now what do I do, since I don't have the vaguest idea of where to start?
We have to get the body out of here.
But how?
They'll see us, and if they do...!
My Lord Bishop?
My Lord Bishop?
My Lord Bishop?
What are you doing here?
Get out of here.
If they found you in my room, you'd be dead.
I'm not going.
Martín, please, don't make this even more difficult for me.
I'm going to get married.
Don't do it.
I can't refuse the desires of my uncle.
I love you.
You know... no one's ever done anything even vaguely like this for me.
Why are you so kind with me?
A family is always there to help, Sátur.
It's ready, Sátur,... it's ready.
Let's go.
May God take him into His glory.
Let's go, Master.
Hernán.
What are you doing dressed like that?
Where did you get this?
The Red Eagle has intercepted the royal shipment,... and I've come to bring back your jewelry.
This was the business you were trying to tell me about?
As you see, there was little for you to do.
Yes, I see.
Some of these pieces aren't mine, Hernán.
Accept it as a personal gift.
Are you asking for my forgiveness, Hernán?
In that case, I forgive you... your arguments have convinced me.
I'm sorry, Lucrecia,... this piece isn't for you,... it's the ring for my fiancée.
What's to keep me from telling the king who plundered him?
I want half of the value as my price of silence.
So are we back working together again?
If you want to call it that...
Where's the rest?
In safekeeping.
You could have kept it all for yourself,... why did you told me?
It's a farewell gift.
Hernán,... you'll be back.
That's fine.
I'm sorry to interrupt you, your Majesty,... but I ought to tell you some news of vital importance.
Go ahead.
The shipment of the ransom for the soldiers going to Portugal has been robbed.
It was the Red Eagle.
I want his head.
Nobody robs the kings of Spain.
Gonzalo,... are you here already?
~ Yes.
~ I'm very much worried.
~ We haven't had a storm like this for quite a while.
~ Yeah.
Margarita, the king has already dispatched the loot to effect the rescue,...
You can relax.
Rely on him,... and smile just a bit, hey?
That's much better.
I'm sorry.
Sátur, go on, change those clothes or you'll get pneumonia.
Good night.
Good night.
Sorry I spoiled your moment, Master.
Have you spoken with Estuarda?
Yeah.
I told her that everything was under control,... so she calmed down a bit.
I've got my heart in my mouth, Master.
Don't worry, Sátur, no one will notice.
No one will ever know.
I know it, and The One who's up there,...
That One really knows it, indeed.
This is already dried out.
Maybe there you'll find the answers to all the questions you've been asking yourself for so long.
A shield.
Such a mess all about a shield?
With a Red Eagle.
With your approval or not, I will do it... the killers of Cristina will pay for it.
Vengeance is dangerous, Gonzalo,...
You know where to begin but not where it leads you.
It's not just a question of vengeance, Augustín,...
I'll never have peace without justice.
But your life will be at risk,... think about Alonso,... if he should also lose his father.
I owe it to Cristina,... and to all the innocents who are killed every day.
Do you want to be the people's champion?
That's a tough row to hoe.
I don't need your approval, Augustín.
~ Goodbye.
~ Wait.
The strength of your hatred is enough to get you what you propose,... but you're lacking something.
A Red Eagle?
That will be your name.
Why?
Because it will reflect back to your origins,... someday.
What does this mean, Master?
This is my family's coat of arms.
Martín, what have we done?
Nothing evil, Irene.
Irene?
For God's sake, Martín!
Tell me that this didn't happen.
Tell me that you came to say goodbye and that the night caught you here.
Leave, please, Aunt.
But, Martín, how did you dare?
Miss, you're getting married in two days.
How can we keep this under wraps?
Irene, are you awake?
They've just brought the silk for your wedding gown.
Oh, Irene,... you've got to see these fabrics!
They're just as pure as the bride who's to wear them.
What's going on here?
Nothing, ma'am.
Good, I see you're no longer quite that little snip of a girl who arrived from the convent.
This room is totally stuffy --- open the windows, Catalina.
Has something happened with you?
No, nothing, ma'am.
Irene, don't be late.
Get dressed and leave this room right this minute!
Look, here's another one.
We already have lots.
I told you, when it rains, there are caterpillars all over the place.
We'll get fed to our very ears.
You'll see how happy it'll make your mother when she sees them.
She came in last night with a puffy face.
Yeah, well,...you know, your mother's work...
She told me it was a mucus asphixiae, but mucus asphixiae don't look like that.
Yeah, come on,... let's get some more.
Look at that.
When did he find it?
At dawn,... when he went out in the yard.
My dog found him.
It's the bishop.
What's he have on his neck?
It looks as if from the tip of a pair of scissors, sir.
They stole his ring.
By the Holy Mother, where were you?
Don't change the linen, we did that yesterday.
What's with you?
Nothing.
What's wrong with you, Catalina, why are you crying?
Leave it, you've enough troubles with Juan's matter.
Catalina, what is it?
My nephew,... has deflowered Miss Irene.
She's about to get married!
She's lost her virginity,... and that comes to light on the night of the wedding, you'd better believe it... and now tell me whose fault it'll be.
Well, something can be done, woman,...
They say there are ways,...
What ways could she have, what ways?
I learned of one who inserted a quail's egg,... and the next day she was found dead by beating,... and everyone felt the husband was justified.
Aunt,... can we talk for a few minutes, please?
Say what you have to say,... she's already in the know.
Excuse me, Aunt, please.
Don't cry.
I'm sorry, I'm very sorry.
Your sorry is worthless,... the same as your life --- if you don't leave this house.
If I leave they'll blame you, you know that,...
I can't leave you hanging out to dry.
Whatever the price, I'll pay it.
Margarita,... they've robbed the shipment going to Portugal to ransom the soldiers.
What?
They said it was the Red Eagle.
~ No.
~ Margarita.
Then we search in the books of heraldry for the shield with the eagle... and assuming Augustín wasn't preparing some other mysteries for us,... we know who your family is, right, Master?
I hope so.
Be it known that the shipment of the ransom to Portugal... was stolen this very night by the Red Eagle!
His Majesty the king will personally offer a reward of 100 ducats... to whoever brings him the head of such a vile criminal.
Come on, we've been deceived,... he's the people's hero!
I hope you'll nab that Eagle, and personally hand that head to the king on a tray.
But what's got into all of you?
Don't you remember what that man has done for you?
Sátur, this infamy has just condemned our soldiers, that's what this has done.
I'd stick my hands in the fire for him.
Why would he do such a thing?
Well, because he's surely a Portuguese...
But what do you say, Portuguese --- he's Spanish!
Yes, he is Portuguese, I tell you,... that's why he hardly opens his mouth... so as not to reveal his accent.
You aren't well, your brain's melted, and you haven't even noticed.
Portuguese.
Sátur, drop it,... the important thing is that they've foiled the rescue, and without it, our men are done for.
That's true, but... but to accuse the Red Eagle...
Let's go.
What feeble historical memory there is in this kingdom.
Sátur, they've found the body of the bishop,...
Calm down, Estuarda, we're already home.
I can't, Sátur, they've found the body and they could find us.
That won't happen.
We'll get out of this.
And what'll be Gabi's fate?
They're going to burn us alive.
I won't allow it.
Trust me.
Where's the clothing, did you trash it?
No.
I thought of washing it, Sátur,...
I'm almost out of clothes.
~ Give it to me.
~ But not the scarf.
It's the last remembrance of my mother, she embroidered my name on it.
Give me everything,...
I'll take care.
You've stolen it?
Everyone knows this ring belongs to the bishop.
Did you steal it, Estuarda?
I didn't realize I had it, Sátur,... and don't shout at me, please, don't shout.
Sorry.
We're going to get out of this, I promise you.
Trust me.
I'm going to get rid of all this.
Within a couple of days,... when they're dried out,... we'll ask Sátur to prepare us a good stew.
But, I'm so hungry,... that I wouldn't mind eating them right away.
How many could there be?
I don't know.
Go to the kitchen, pick up a bowl, and we'll count them.
Fine.
What happened to you, you're covered in blood?
I cut myself sharpening the scissors.
It looks like the tip of a pair of scissors.
Alonso, Alonso, is this one all right?
~ Alonso, is this one all right?
~ What?
Let's see.
Yeah, yeah, this one's fine, fine.
And what exactly are we looking for, Master?
Well, apart from the dead guards,...
Where are you going?
What's this, Master?
It's the inventory of the shipment.
Almost everything was jewelry.
They're listed along with the names of their donors.
Topazes, diamonds,... three-carat emeralds --- three carats, no less!
That would be about the size of a pinto bean!
All this doesn't help us.
Give it to me, paper is always useful... that these times I got my butt... skinless.
Master, if we find the jewelry,... what do we do with it, who do we give it to?
Because in this situation, in the middle of a war we can't just go to Portugal and ask for the hostages, can we?
In the Portuguese's letter, they set up the exchange,... at the fortress of the Knights of Jerez.
Don't tell me you also know Portuguese?
Yes, Sátur.
Ah, Master, you are a bottomless pit full of wisdom!
Let's go.
Master, Master!
Are you all right?
We could have died,... ~ if it hadn't been for you.
~ Let's go.
Is everything all right, Nuño?
Yes, yes.
What did you say to him?
I told him he'd never stop being like a son to me.
Oh, why did you lie to him, Hernán?
You can't act like a father when you're not around,... do you really think you'll be hanging around my palace when you're newly married?
It was you who pushed for this marriage.
Look at me.
Why do you always reject me?
We're not interrupting anything, I suppose?
~ No.
~ Of course not, your Eminence.
You look darling, Irene.
Well, everybody's already here.
Margarita, are you all right?
Yes, I'm a little dizzy, but it'll pass soon.
~ Are you sure?
~ Yes, yes.
Can't you hear me?
Ma'am, Margarita isn't feeling well,... could you excuse her?
Now that she's not going to be ennobled, I don't think it suits her to lose her job.
Let's go.
Irene, I want you to accept this ring as proof of my commitment.
It's a magnificent piece, commissioner.
It looks like you're making good use of your dowry.
Now it's yours.
But it's too much for me.
Nothing is too much for you.
Margarita!
Ma'am...
Margarita, Margarita!
Breathe deeply, for God's sake, breathe!
Margarita, in God's name, breathe deeply.
She's with us again.
~ Gonzalo.
~ How are you?
What happened to you?
I'm fine, Gonzalo, I'm just a bit weak, that's all.
No, no way.
This very moment you're going home with Gonzalo, right?
No, of course not, Cata, don't worry, the truth is I'm fine.
But have you eaten something?
~ Yes.
~ How long has she been like that?
It's been a while.
It happened when the commissioner gave Irene the engagement ring.
It's the biggest emerald I've seen in my entire life.
Stop, stop for the guard!
No, let me go!
I didn't kill him!
I didn't kill the bishop, I swear!
Enough!
The jeweler you sold this to betrayed you.
Where are the scissors?
What scissors?
I don't know anything, sir,...
I just found this ring lying in the road.
Drag him away.
This evening at midnight he'll be executed on the spike.
How could I be so blind?
Why didn't I catch on to this before?
What's going on, Master?
It's about who stole the ransom.
Who hates me so much that he wants to frame me for the deed?
Who?
The commissioner.
Your brother?
Are you sure?
Sure.
Give me those papers we found in the gorge.
Is it true there's a giant emerald on the list?
Yes, I think so, but let's double check.
What's happening?
What's happening is that I think I've signed Estuarda's death warrant!
I put everything in a sack to get rid of it, but... ~ What have you done, Sátur?
~ I think I left it there.
Estuarda's scarf, the bishop's ring,...
I'm just worthless!
My head isn't on straight, Master.
And it's too late to cry about it, take the horse and get there at once.
Yes, yes!
Where's the ransom?
You should know, you stole it.
Tell me where it is.
Never.
Are you going to dare to this time?
My feelings are a mess, Mother,... a big mess,... one of those which looks like it can't be solved,... because, if I stay mum, they'll kill this kid, and I know he's innocent,... but if I tell the truth, then, Sátur...
I don't know what's more important, Mother... whether it's justice or love, I just don't know.
My God!
What am I doing?
This is too big for me to handle by myself.
Dad?
Dad!
Let the bag be there, for God's sake!
Let it be there!
Was it here where it fell?
Or was I farther away?
I just can't think straight...
I just can't figure it out.
They've taken it, it's not around here.
My head's full of shit!
What are you looking for, buddy?
Out of here, let's go, out!
What do you want?
That boy.
He's innocent.
He didn't kill the bishop.
How do you know that?
Because I know who killed him.
Well, speak up, I don't have all day.
It was...
I don't know.
I don't know, I made it up...
I only wanted to claim the reward, sorry.
Get out of here.
Beat it!
Out!
~ Sátur...
~ Holy shit!
Cipriano, you came in so silently I almost dropped dead, shit!
I'm sorry, I just saw you come in, and... and I've got bad news, Sátur.
Estuarda and Gabi have left town.
When?
More than six hours ago.
And you only just now got here to tell me?
She asked me to, Sátur,...
Estuarda said I had to wait until after nightfall before telling you... she doesn't want you to follow them.
Where are they headed?
Sátur, I know how hard it is to lose a family.
Where did they go, Cipriano?
!
Tell me!
Southwards, to catch a ship to the Americas.
The Americas...
Leave us alone.
Irene,... you know that ever since you were born I've always treated you like a daughter.
I know, Uncle, and I'm very grateful.
I'm glad to hear it, since I've noted at times that you seemed unhappy... with the decisions I've had to make in this cruel world... but I assure you that I've made them with our best interests at heart.
I welcome your attitude.
Now rest a while.
I know how you're feeling.
You don't want to get married.
The bad news is that there's little that can be done about it,... but we will always have wine.
You want some?
Drink, it'll do you good, I assure you.
More.
Drink it all.
Now nothing will bother you.
Dad!
What are you doing here, what are you up to?
Nothing.
And you, what's up with you?
Nothing.
Dad, you, since you always know what's right or what's wrong,...
I don't always, Son.
No, Dad, if I...if I... if I did something really wrong, would you reject me?
You've never done anything that bad.
But if I did?
If anyone in your family did something horrible, you...
No, I wouldn't have the guts.
Well, that's what's happening with me.
What are you on about, Son?
What are you talking about?
I know that Sátur killed the bishop,... but I couldn't inform on him,... and that boy's going to die.
Here, Alonso,... go on home and then we'll talk, right?
Go on.
~ And you --- where are you going?
~ I'll be there in a minute, don't worry.
Dad, can I sleep with you tonight?
I don't want to be alone.
Of course, Son,... go to my room and wait for me... and I'll be back before you fall asleep... fair enough?
Go ahead.
Don't worry.
"To the Master, from Sátur,...
"Master, when you read these lines,...
"I'll be far away.
"I'm a traitor and a disgrace no matter how you look at it,...
"the dregs of the human race.
"Master, I found the chest with the ransom,...
"as if by chance,...
"as if Destiny had put it into my path to tempt me,...
"and I've succumbed to it.
"I'm sorry for the wrong I'm going to cause,...
"mostly to Margarita,...
"but I have another battle,...
"that of my woman and son, against degradation and hunger,...
"and I can't put up with that any more.
"I know God won't forgive me,...
"nor do I hope for forgiveness.
"I'll bear this fault throughout eternity.
"Goodbye, Master"
Catalina, accompany Irene for a medical exam.
What medical exam?
So that our future spouses know that we're healthy and chaste.
We must go back and return the king's money... or else our soldiers will be killed by your fault.
I can't, Alonso.
This isn't a letter from Sátur, Gonzalo, this is a death sentence.
After the wedding I don't want you to come back here anymore.
~ Where are we?
~ I don't know.
But if we're here, maybe it's to make an exchange.
To kill us.
I regret nothing, and I bear my disgrace.
For you it's a disgrace, for my nephew it's a hanging.
It's my last chance to have a family.
I've never failed you,... and I won't fail you now.
How long since you've seen Alonso?
Last night, why?
The property titles for your new land...
I feel sorry for you, that's why I'm willing to help you.
I've decided not to pay.
Every hour ten men will die.
Aim!
I hope you'll be able to forgive me someday.
Fire!
Sátur!
Sátur, please!
Previously on The Big C...
I've been really confused.
I shouldn't have feelings, but I do.
- What's the problem?
- You don't have permits for this job.
I do one small construction project and you have to go behind my back!
You're a pain in the ass.
Don't move here for me.
You are such a cunt!
Get out of my house, or I'll blow your brains out!
You can't remember where you put a gun?
I have Alzheimer's.
Mom said in a letter that we got the day after she died that she thought it was time for her to go because she didn't trust herself not to do something stupid.
And she didn't want to become a burden, so...
Which is why she actually arranged this funeral herself.
This is so beautiful.
She shot herself in the fucking head.
This is not beautiful.
Our mom pretended to hate polka music.
She said, "The only way to dance to it makes you look like an asshole."
But every time my dad pulled out his accordion, it always brought a smile to her face.
Maybe I'll have a band.
Not a polka band, but maybe a marching band.
For what?
My funeral.
So, enjoy the polka music and enjoy the buffet.
That's what our mom would've wanted.
- Scratch off?
- No, thank you, that's inappropriate.
Me, neither.
No, thank you.
I'm going to the buffet to obliterate my feelings.
Well, I'll be damned!
I'm a winner!
Good for you.
Adam, how are you doing?
- Adam.
- Hey, Mom.
I...
I just want you to know, if you want to talk about Marlene, if you have any questions about death,
or anything?
No.
I'm good.
Can I meet Mia at the movies after this?
- Sure.
- Yes.
Oh, look, can I have some money for popcorn?
No.
Okay.
Don't like death, don't like death, thinking good thoughts, thinking good thoughts.
I know.
I know you hate this.
Marlene tried to make it nice.
Yeah, I should never have come.
My palms are sweaty, my chest is compressed, and it feels like a spirit keeps running its hands through my hair.
Well, at least you're having a reaction.
I don't understand why Adam seems so unaffected.
Marlene pulled a gun on him and then shot herself.
He's just a little emotionally constipated.
Oh, my God!
Did you invite Psycho?
Hi, Cathy.
She wanted to come.
Well, if she murders me, you throw me on top of Marlene.
We're running out of room to put people.
Hey.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
Poor Marlene!
It's good to see you.
But you didn't have to come.
I wanted to be here for you.
- How are you?
- I won!
- Look at that.
- It's hard to be sad when every five minutes someone wins $20 on a scratch off.
Yeah.
It's...
It's quite an affair.
I am so glad it's a closed casket.
My grandpa had an open casket and I have this recurring dream now about his death face trying to kiss me.
There's Sean.
Can I...
Let me just catch up with you in a couple minutes, okay?
Sean?
I see you hiding behind that tombstone.
Sean Tolkey!
Hi, I'm Cathy.
I live across the street from your mom.
You're Cathy.
We were wondering who you were.
- I'm Lorna.
- I'm Gina.
This is my wife, Buttercup.
Look at you.
Hair like a waterfall.
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Well, it is so nice to meet all of you.
Your mom, she...
She talked about you all the time.
She was so proud of the two of you.
Mom was a lot of things, but she was not proud.
Whenever I'd call her, she'd say, "Hey, bull dyke, how are things in Atlanta?"
And for 25 years, she insisted on calling my Jewish husband,
"That white witch you live with."
So, we are talking about the same Marlene.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
She had an edge to her, but we became pretty close this summer.
She meant a lot to our family.
You must have meant a lot to her, too.
Otherwise she wouldn't have left you the house.
What?
Yeah.
She changed her will recently.
She said in it that she wanted you to have the house.
Well, your dad built that house.
It's...
It's very special.
It...
It should go to you.
Thank you.
We were thinking she was a little confused.
Oh, my God, I won.
I won!
25 bucks, honey, I won.
25 bucks.
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah, baby.
Thank you, Marlene.
So, finish it.
Happy to.
In about nine months.
I wanna be able to dive into my pool by the end of the summer.
Well, since tomorrow is the last day of summer, you need to find a new dream.
How much?
Look, all of my crews are out on other jobs.
And we don't start pools in the fall.
Call me in nine months and we'll talk.
You wait by the phone.
Sean, I just wanna talk to you for five minutes.
No, thanks.
Scared of you.
Well, eventually you're gonna have to stop, whether it's to go to the bathroom or because you come to a dangerous intersection.
- And when that happens...
- What, Rebecca?
What?
- What, what, what?
- Oh, God.
You smell so...
Oh, God, you see?
You're like the exorcist.
You have so much evil in you, some of it had to blow out.
Oh, you wish.
I'm pregnant!
And before you say something really crass about whose it is, it's yours.
What?
You...
You...
You said you were on the pill.
What pill was that?
Zoloft?
Okay, I'm not gonna lie.
I've gotten kind of lazy about the pill since I turned 40 because I figured my fallopian ship had probably sailed.
Well, that's stupid!
Women in their hundreds are having babies now.
You've really got a lot of nerve.
I had a completely shitty weekend trying to figure out how and why this immaculate conception even occurred.
But I've decided, even though it's a cruel joke from God, probably, that I'm gonna call his bluff.
Because I think this is the last shot that I'm gonna get at having a biological child.
So, out of decency and respect,
I just wanted to let you know that you're gonna have a blood child in the world.
But that's all I'm doing, just letting you know.
I don't need anything from you.
I don't expect anything from you.
I am just letting you know.
She gets stung by 1,000 bees, it doesn't do anything?
Her scans showed no significant changes.
Okay, well, what's next?
Well, I signed you guys up for a clinical trial they're doing in Boston.
Great.
We love Boston.
When do we leave?
Starts up in six months, if you get in.
What are we supposed to do for six months?
As for other treatment options besides Interleukin-2, there's really just...
Okay, wait, Interlochen-2.
We talked about that.
You said...
You said you couldn't do that.
Technically, I could do it.
Personally, I can't do it.
Well, if she's not doing it, then why are you bringing it up?
It's one of the only drugs out there with even a possibility of lasting effects.
For some people, it's a new chance at life.
If we could knock this thing out...
I could die on the table.
The fatality rate is low.
So is the success rate.
Tell him how it works.
Well, it works by stimulating the growth of two different kinds of white blood cells.
So, a patient would come into the ICU, where we would monitor them and give them the drug intravenously for several days.
It's very toxic.
There are a lot of side effects.
Burning scabs all over my body, constantly throwing up, fluid on the lungs.
My veins could shut down.
And did I mention,
- I could die on the table?
- I gave her a brochure.
I don't wanna get sicker trying to get better and then just end up dying anyway.
That's what I was trying to say about Marlene.
There was something kind of beautiful about the way she just left.
She shot herself in the fucking head.
Okay, six months.
We wait six months.
Hey, Thomas.
Hey.
I know, I keep taking you over to my house, you keep coming back here.
So, you know what?
I am not gonna force the issue.
But whenever you're ready, you just tuck your chew toys under a wrinkle and come on over.
Hungry worker bees.
I brought over some chilli so you wouldn't have to worry about lunch.
You are too much.
That's so sweet, Cathy.
Wow.
Wow, you guys are really clearing out.
Yeah.
How are you holding up?
The hardest part was realising what a hoarder Mom was.
I found this popsicle-stick house upstairs that I made in the second grade.
Trash or treasure?
- Trash.
- Trash.
Really?
That's your mom on her wedding day.
It's a great picture, I know, I love it, but I got a copy of it already.
- Me, too.
- Could I have it?
- Sure.
- Sure.
Wow.
I hope whoever buys this place will be happy here.
It'll be so weird to look across the street and not see Marlene on her porch.
You won't see the porch, either.
What do...
- What do you mean?
- I have this realtor friend that says the house would cost so much to fix up.
We're just gonna tear it down, sell the land.
But it's a beautiful house.
Trash or treasure?
- Trash.
- Trash.
I'll take them.
I'm pregnant.
Rebecca is a crazy son of a bitch, but she says it's mine, and it probably is.
I can buy that.
So, what does that mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
It means she's gonna push an infant out of her vagina and keep it and raise it.
And she wants me to stay out of it.
Are you okay with that?
Look at me.
What do I know about being a parent?
What do you think?
You wanna know what I think?
Yes.
I do.
I think you're gonna be a dad!
Oh, God!
And I think I'm gonna be an aunt!
Yes, you would make this about you.
Come on.
Come on!
Let me finish.
Let me have one moment of enthusiasm.
All right, moment over!
Because I don't even know if I'll ever see this kid, or if Rebecca will stay here or go to Chicago or what.
Oh, then...
I think you should stay out of it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Rebecca'll be great on her own.
She'll buy it little designer outfits and just spoil it with toys.
And the profits from those toys will keep a lot of corporations in business.
I...
I...
I'm gonna have to kidnap this kid and raise it in the woods.
All right, stop staring at me with that creepy smile.
When you said, "Let's watch a family movie," I thought...
I was thinking Ace Ventura:
Pet Detective or something fucking animated.
But you made us sit through Where the Red Fern Grows.
What did you think, Adam?
It was pretty emotional, huh?
It was cool, for an old-fashioned kind of movie.
Do...
Do you...
Do you get it?
The one dog got injured and passed away, and then the other one died out of grief.
- Yeah, I got it.
- Yeah, he got it, he got it.
We all got it, we all got it.
I'm out of here.
Oh, yeah, Dad, can I get some money to go to lunch with Brent?
No, you can't.
Are you my dad?
Buddy, I gave you 20 bucks at the beginning of the week.
You gotta learn to make it last.
Fine.
Heart of stone, that kid.
- God.
- That's the saddest fucking thing
I've ever seen.
God.
Hi, Cathy.
What did you do to Marlene's fish?
We feel really bad about that.
But we didn't know what else to do.
We had to take the tank down.
We tried flushing them down the toilet, but they kept coming back up.
I'm sure someone would have taken them.
Yeah, but we gotta get home soon, and we just don't have a lot of time.
Where's Thomas?
My fault.
I have the worst dander allergy.
I don't sneeze, but I feel like I want to, and my eyes get all runny.
We took him to the shelter.
He's 12 years old.
He has cataracts.
No one's going to adopt him.
Yeah, so he probably didn't have much time left anyway.
What can you do, huh?
Get out.
- What?
- On behalf of Thomas and myself, get the fuck out of our house.
Marlene might have been a little rough around the edges, but you're downright cruel.
You kill Marlene's fish.
You send Thomas off to die.
And maybe your mom didn't leave you the house to teach you a lesson, or maybe she just didn't like you.
But either way, she left it to me.
So, you take whatever you want, and you get the fuck out.
Because it's mine now.
And if you want to fight me on it, that's great, 'cause I just got in a fighting mood.
Hi, Paul.
- I need to talk to you.
- I need to talk to you.
- You go.
- You go.
I think we should go to Italy and live on the Venice canals for six months while we wait for the clinical trial.
I wanna do Interleukin.
I don't.
I was reading a blog about it.
It sounded awful.
They had horrible hallucinations.
They couldn't even finish.
Well, it was wrong for Marlene to check out early.
I mean, it wasn't beautiful.
And it wasn't fair to any of us, including Thomas.
I mean, maybe she didn't feel that she had enough support around her, but I do.
And Sean's gonna have a baby.
And I hope it's as cute as he was as a kid.
He was so cute.
And Adam, God, who knows?
But if he's not ready to grieve, then I'm not ready to go.
And I am loving the new us.
So, maybe this treatment will make me look all scabby and weird-looking, which is gonna be harder on you than it will be on me 'cause I can just avoid mirrors.
I'm gonna hang on as long as I can.
And I'm going out ugly.
It will never be hard for me to look at you.
- Hey.
- What are you...
Why are you...
- You're so clean.
- I took a shower.
You took a shower?
Yep, but I don't want to use a towel that you'll then have to use 1,000 gigahertz of electricity to dry, so, I'm just gonna run around the block real quick.
No, you are not going to run around my neighbourhood naked.
Well, if you're worried that I'll knock my nuts together and render myself sterile, don't.
These boys have already done their job.
Dry off.
It is so nice to see you clean.
Well, apparently, my nature scent was making Rebecca throw up, so...
So, you're talking to her.
I'm planning on it.
I have something for you.
What's that?
It's a house.
It's Marlene's house.
She gave it to me.
I'm giving it to you.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm not going to change my whole life and personality like you did just 'cause I'm having a kid.
I dare you to have a kid and stay the same person you are now.
Daring me just lowered your chances that I'll take it.
- Fine.
- No.
I am just going to think about it.
So, this treatment could knock it out completely.
I think it will.
My gut instinct is that it will.
So I'll be in the hospital for five days this round.
And, you know, I'm kind of looking forward to it.
I mean, lying in bed, reading magazines.
- When do I get to do that?
- So, we've just gotta...
You know, we gotta man up and not burn the house down, and help Mom out when she gets home.
- Okay.
- 'Cause I'm...
I'm gonna look a little weird.
And I'm not gonna have all my strength back right away.
So, do you have any questions?
Or any feelings at all you might want to pour out?
I just hope you're gonna be okay.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Can I go over to Mia's?
- Sure.
- Yes.
Here.
Take her these.
Okey-dokey.
20 bucks?
- No.
- No!
Okay, jeez, fine.
Guess crying skips a generation.
You ready to go?
Paul.
Hey.
How are you doing?
Good.
I guess.
They're just prepping her, so I thought I'd give her a little privacy, you know?
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.
There's this nurse, Annabelle, who introduced herself to me, said she's gonna be doing the Interlochen.
- Interleukin.
- When she introduced herself to me, she dropped her pen, and then when she bent down to pick it up, she stepped on it.
And I'm just wondering, are we sure that we want, you know, Nurse Slippery Fingers to be doing this?
Annabelle's a great nurse.
I'd let her stick me with a needle any day.
Look, Paul,
I'm not gonna tell you not to worry.
All right, but she's got top-notch care.
And I'm gonna be here every day.
I know you will.
And...
I know I've been giving you a hard time, but I know you've been really important to her.
The way I see it, we have two options here.
Either you can have this baby and leave it on the steps of the firehouse for someone more qualified to raise it,
or I can help you fuck it up.
But you're not going to raise this baby by yourself and fuck it up alone.
If we're going to fuck it up, we're going to fuck it up together.
So, that's where I'm at.
Oh, and...
I have a house now.
So, what do you have to say about that?
You smell good.
Just close your eyes and relax.
Previously on The big C...
I've been really confused.
I shouldn't have feelings, but I do.
What's the problem?
You don't have permits for this job.
I do one small construction project and you have to go behind my back.
- You're a pain in the ass.
- Don't move here for me.
You are such a cunt!
Get out of my house.
Or I'll blow your brains out.
You can't remember where you put a gun?
I have Alzheimer's.

This is so beautiful.

This is not beautiful.
Our mom pretended to hate polka music.

Because it's mine now.
And if you wanna fight me on it, that's great.
'Cause I just got in a fighting mood.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
Hi.
Paul, I need to talk to you.
I need to talk to you.
Both:
You go.
I think we should go to Italy and live on the Venice canals for six months while we wait for the clinical trial.
I wanna do interleukin.
I don't.
I was reading a blog about it.
It sounded awful.
They had horrible hallucinations.
They couldn't even finish.
Well...
It was wrong for Marlene to check out early.
I mean, it wasn't beautiful.
And it wasn't fair to any of us, including Thomas.
I mean, maybe she didn't feel that she had enough support around her, but I do.
And Sean's gonna have a baby.
And I hope it's as cute as he was as a kid.
He was so cute.
And Adam, I...
Oh, God.
Who knows?
But if he's not ready to grieve, then I'm not ready to go.
And I am loving the new us.
So maybe this treatment will make me look all scabby and weird-looking, which is gonna be harder on you than it will be on me 'cause I can just avoid mirrors.
I'm gonna hang on as long as I can.
And I'm going out ugly.
It will never be hard for me to look at you.
- Hey.
- What are you...
Why are you...
You're so clean.
I took a shower.
You took a shower?
Yep, but I don't wanna use a towel that you'll then have to use a thousand gigahertz of electricity to dry, so, um, I'm just gonna run around the block real quick.
No, you are not going to run around my neighborhood naked.
Well, if you're, uh, worried that I'll knock my nuts together and render myself sterile, don't.
These boys have already done their job.
Dry off.
It is so nice to see you clean.
Well, apparently, my nature scent was making Rebecca throw up, so...
So you're talking to her.
I'm planning on it.
I have something for you.
What's that?
It's a house.
It's Marlene's house.
She gave it to me.
I'm giving it to you.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm not going to change my whole life and personality like you did just 'cause I'm having a kid.
I dare you to have a kid and stay the same person you are now.
Daring me just lowered your chances that I'll take it.
Fine.
No.
I am just going to think about it.
So this treatment could knock it out completely.
I think it will.
My gut instinct is that it will.
So I'll, I'll be in the hospital for five days this round.
And, you know, I'm kind of looking forward to it.
I mean, lying in bed reading magazines.
When do I get to do that?
So we just gotta, you know, we've gotta man up and not burn the house down and help mom out when she gets home.
- Okay.
- 'Cause I'm...
I'm gonna look a little weird.
And I'm not gonna have all my strength back right away.
So...
Do you have any questions?
Or any feelings...
At all you might wanna pour out?
I just hope you're gonna be okay.
I love you.
I love you too.
Mom, can I go over to Mia's?
- Sure.
- [Softly] Yes.
Oh, here.
You take her these.
Okey-dokey.
Um, 20 bucks?
- No.
- No.
Okay, geez, fine.
Guess crying skips a generation.
You ready to go?
- Paul.
- Hey.
How are you doing?
Good.
I guess.
They're just prepping her, so I thought I'd,
I'd give her a little privacy, you know?
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.
There's this nurse Annabelle, who introduced herself to me, said she's gonna be doing the interlochen.
Uh, interleukin.
When she introduced herself to me, she dropped her pen, and then when she bent down to pick it up, she stepped on it.
And I'm just wondering, are we sure that we want, you know, nurse slippery fingers to be doing this?
Annabelle's a great nurse.
I'd let her stick me with a needle any day.
Look, Paul.
I'm not gonna tell you not to worry, all right?
But she's got p-notch care.
And I'm gonna be here every day.
I know you will.
And, um, I know I've given you a hard time but, uh, I know you've been really important to her.
The way I see it, we have two options here.
Either you can have this baby and leave it on the steps of the firehouse for someone more qualified to raise it, or...
I can help you fuck it up.
But you're not going to raise this baby by yourself and fuck it up alone.
If we're going to fuck it up, we're going to fuck it up together.
So that's where I'm at.
Oh, and, uh,
I have a house now.
So...
What do you have to say about that?
You smell good.

Mom said in a letter that we got the day after she died that she thought it was time for her to go because she didn't trust herself not to do something stupid.
And she didn't want to become a burden, so...
Which is why she actually arranged this funeral herself.
This is so beautiful.
She shot herself in the fucking head.
This is not beautiful.
Our mom pretended to hate polka music.
She said,
"The only way to dance to it makes you look like an asshole."
But every time my dad pulled out his accordion, it always brought a smile to her face.
Maybe I'll have a band.
Not-not a polka band, but...
Maybe a marching band.
For what?
My funeral.
So enjoy the polka music and enjoy the buffet.
That's what our mom would have wanted.
♪ ♪
Scratch off?
No, thank you, that's inappropriate.
Me neither.
No, thank you.
I'm going to the buffet to obliterate my feelings.
Well, I'll be damned!
I'm a winner!
Good for you.
♪ ♪
Adam, how are you doing?
- Adam.
- Oh, hey, mom.
I...
I just want you to know if, if you wanna talk about Marlene, if you have any questions about death or...
Anything?
No.
I'm good.
Oh, um, can I meet Mia at the movies after this?
- Sure.
- Yes.
Oh, yeah.
Um, can I have some money for popcorn?
No.
Okay.
Don't like death, don't like death, thinking good thoughts, thinking good thoughts.
I, I know.
I know, you hate this.
Marlene tried to make it nice.
Yeah, I should never have come.
My palms are sweaty, my chest is compressed.
And it feels like a spirit keeps running its hands through my hair.
Well, at least you're having a reaction.
I don't understand why Adam seems so unaffected.
Marlene pulled a gun on him and then shot herself.
He's just a little emotionally constipated.
Oh, my God!
Did you invite psycho?
Oh, hi, Cathy.
She wanted to come.
Well, if she murders me, you throw me on top of Marlene.
We're running out of room to put people.
Hey.
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.
Poor Marlene.
- It's...
- Oh...
It's good to see you.
But you didn't have to come.
I wanted to be here for you.
How are you?
- I won.
- Whoo-hoo!
It's hard to be sad when every five minutes someone wins $20 in a scratch-off.
Yeah.
It's, uh, it's...
it's quite an affair.
I am so glad it's a closed casket.
My grandpa had an open casket and I have this recurring dream now about his death face trying to kiss me.
There's Sean.
Uh, can I...
Uh, let me just catch up with you in a couple minutes, okay?
Sean?
I see you hiding behind that tombstone.
Sean Tolkey!
♪ ♪
Hi.
I'm Cathy.
I-I live across the street from your mom.
Oh, you're Cathy.
We were wondering who you were.
- I'm Lorna.
- I'm Gina.
This is my wife, buttercup.
Look at you.
Hair like a waterfall.
It's so nice to meet you.
Well, it is, it is so nice to meet all of you.
Your mom, she...
She talked about you all the time.
She was so proud of the two of you.
Uh...
Mom was a lot of things, but she was not proud.
Whenever I'd call her, she'd say,
"hey, bull-dyke, how are things in Atlanta?"
And for 25 years, she insisted on calling my Jewish husband
"That white witch" you live with.
So we are talking about the same Marlene.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
She had an edge to her, but we became pretty close this summer.
She meant a lot to our family.
You must have meant a lot to her too.
Otherwise she wouldn't have left you the house.
What?
Yeah.
She changed her will recently.
She said in it that she wanted you to have the house.
Well...
Your dad built that house.
It's, it's very special.
It should go to you.
Thank you.
We were thinking she was a little confused.
Oh, my God, I won.
I won.
25 bucks, honey, I won.
25 bucks.
That's what I'm talking about.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah, baby.
Oh.
Oh!
Thank you, Marlene.
So finish it.
Happy to.
In about nine months.
I wanna be able to, to dive into my pool by the end of the summer.
Well, since tomorrow is the last day of summer, you need to find a new dream.
How much?
Look, all of my crews are out on other jobs.
And we don't start pools in the fall.
Call me in nine months and we'll talk.
You wait by the phone.
Sean.
I just wanna talk to you for five minutes.
No, thanks.
Scared of you.
Well, eventually you're gonna have to stop whether it's to go to the bathroom or because you come to a dangerous intersection.
And when that happens... what, Rebecca?
What?
What, what, what?
Oh, God.
You smell so...
Oh, God!
You see?
You're...
You're like the exorcist.
You have so much evil in you, some of it had to blow out.
Oh, you wish.
I'm pregnant.
And before you say something really crass about whose it is, it's yours.
What?
You... you said you were on the pill.
What pill was that?
Zoloft?
Okay, I'm not gonna lie.
I've gotten kind of lazy about the pill since I turned 40 because I figured my fallopian ship had probably sailed.
Well, that's stupid.
Women in their...
their hundreds are having babies now.
You've really got a lot of nerve.
I had a completely shitty weekend trying to figure out how and why this immaculate conception even occurred.
But I've decided even though it's a cruel joke from God, probably, that I'm gonna call his bluff.
Because I think this is the last shot that I'm gonna get at having a biological child.
So out of decency and respect,
I just wanted to let you know that you're gonna have a blood child in the world.
But that's all I'm doing, just letting you know.
I don't need anything from you.
I don't expect anything from you.
I am just letting you know.
She gets stung by a thousand bees, it doesn't do anything?
Her scans showed no significant changes.
Okay.
Well, what's next?
Well, I signed you guys up for a clinical trial they're doing in Boston.
Great.
We love Boston.
When do we leave?
Starts up in six months if you get in.
What, what are we supposed to do for six months?
As for other treatment options, besides interleukin-2, there's really just...
Okay, wait, interlochen-2.
We talked about that.
You said, you said you couldn't do that.
Technically, I could do it.
Personally, I can't do it.
Well, if she's not doing it, then why are you bringing it up?
It's one of the only drugs out there with even a possibility of lasting effects.
For some people, it's a new chance at life.
If we could knock this thing out...
I could die the table.
The fatality rate is low.
So is the success rate.
Tell him how it works.
Well, it works by stimulating the growth of two different kinds of white blood cells.
So a patient would come into the ICU, where we would monitor them and give them the drug intravenously for several days.
It's very toxic.
There are a lot of side effects.
Burning scabs all over my body, constantly throwing up, fluid on the lungs, my veins could shut down.
Oh, and did I mention, I could die on the table?
I gave her a brochure.
I don't wanna get sicker trying to get better and then just end up dying anyway.
That's what I was trying to say about Marlene.
There was something kind of beautiful about the way she just left.
She shot herself in the fuckin' head.
Okay, six months.
We wait six months.
Hey, Thomas.
Hey.
I know, I keep taking you over to my house and you keep coming back here.
So you know what?
I am not gonna force the issue.
But whenever you're ready, you just tuck your chew toys under a wrinkle and come on over.
Yoo-hoo.
Hungry worker bees.
I brought over some chili so you wouldn't have to worry about lunch.
You are too much.
So sweet, Cathy.
Wow.
Wow, you guys are really clearing out.
- Oh, yeah.
- How are you holding up?
The hardest part was realizing what a hoarder mom was.
I found this popsicle stick house upstairs that I made in the second grade.
Trash or treasure?
- Trash.
- Trash.
Really?
That's your mom on her wedding day.
It's a great picture, I know, I love it, but I got a copy of it already.
- Me too.
- Could I have it?
- Sure.
- Sure.
Wow.
I hope whoever buys this place'll be happy here.
It'll be so weird to look across the street and not see Marlene on her porch.
You won't see the porch either.
What do...
What do you mean?
I have this realtor friend that says the house would cost so much to fix up.
We're just gonna tear it down and sell the land.
But it's a beautiful house.
Trash or treasure?
- Trash.
- Trash.
I'll take them.
I'm pregnant.
Rebecca's a crazy son of a bitch, but she says it's mine, and...
It probably is.
I can buy that.
So what does that mean?
What does it mean?
What... what does it mean?
It means she's gonna push an infant out of her vagina and keep it and raise it.
And... and she wants me to stay out of it.
Are you okay with that?
Look at me.
What do I know about being a parent?
What do you think?
You wanna know what I think?
Yes.
I do.
I think you're gonna be a dad!
- Oh...
- Oh, God!
And I think I'm gonna be an aunt!
Yes, you would make this about you.
Oh, come on.
Come on!
Let me finish.
Let me have one moment of enthusiasm.
All right, all right, moment over!
Because I, I don't even know if I'll ever see this kid.
Or-or if Rebecca will stay here or go to Chicago or what.
Oh, then...
I think you should stay out of it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Rebecca'll be great on her own.
She'll buy it little designer outfits and just spoil it with toys.
And the profits from those toys will keep a lot of corporations in business.
I...
I'm gonna have to kidnap this kid and raise it in the woods.
All right, stop staring at me with that creepy smile.
Oh.
Oh.
You said, "let's watch a family movie."
I thought, you know, I was thinking
Ace Ventura:
Pet Detective or something fuckin' animated.
Oh.
But you made us sit through where the red fern grows.
What did you think, Adam?
It was pretty emotional, huh?
It was cool.
For an old-fashioned kind of movie.
Do you... do you get it?
The one dog...
Got injured and passed away and then the other one died out of grief.
Yeah, I got it.
Yeah, he got it, he got it.
We all got it, we all got it.
I'm out of here.
Oh, yeah.
Um, dad.
Can I get some money to go to lunch with Brent?
No.
You can't.
Are you my dad?
Buddy, I gave you 20 bucks at the beginning of the week.
You gotta learn to make it last.
Fine.
Heart of stone, that kid.
God.
That's the saddest fuckin' thing I've ever seen.
God.
Ugh...
Oh, hi, Cathy.
What did you do to Marlene's fish?
Oh, we feel really bad about that.
But we didn't know what else to do.
We had to take the tank down.
We tried flushing them down the toilet, but they kept coming back up.
I'm sure someone would have taken them.
Yeah, but we gotta get home soon and we just don't have a lot of time.
Where's Thomas?
My fault.
I have the worst dander allergy.
I don't sneeze, but I feel like I want to and my eyes get all runny.
We took him to the shelter.
He's 12 years old.
He has cataracts.
No one's going to adopt him.
Yeah, so he probably didn't have much time left anyway.
Eh.
- Get out.
- What?
On behalf of Thomas and myself, get the fuck out of our house.
Marlene might have been a little rough around the edges, but you're downright cruel.
You kill Marlene's fish, you send Thomas off to die.
And maybe your mom didn't leave you the house to teach you a lesson, or maybe she just didn't like you.
But either way, she left it to me.
So you take whatever you want, and you get the fuck out.
Because it's mine now.
And if you wanna fight me on it, that's great.
'Cause I just got in a fighting mood.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
Hi.
Paul, I need to talk to you.
- I need to talk to you.
- You go.
I think we should go to Italy and live on the Venice canals for six months while we wait for the clinical trial.
I wanna do interleukin.
I don't.

Episode 35
And for a long time afterwards, I searched high and low for his daughter.
His daughter, who had the same name as you.
- My Lord...!
- Choi Dong Yi...
Is that who you are?
Tell me...
Are you the girl I've been looking for?
Are you that Dong Yi?
My Lord...!
Am I right?
Was it you all along?
Yes...
Yes, it was.
It was me.
The one you've been looking for...
The Chief of the Sword Fraternity's daughter...
Choi Dong Yi...
That's my name.
Are you all right?
This is the place.
My Madam from Sungchun has retired here as a monk.
Do you think she'll still have the documents you gave her twelve years ago?
We must hope that she does.
- Sulhee!
- Madam!
It's really you!
I can't believe I'm seeing you again!
Madam!
I knew... that this day would come.
The first time I met you at the Police Bureau and lied to you...
I did it to survive...
To find the truth...
From the first day I entered the Palace...
I was prepared that this day would eventually come.
But not like this...
I never imagined that I would be where I am now.
I never imagined that...
The truth would cause suffering for you and His Majesty...
So you do know that I trusted you.
No...
It doesn't matter for me.
But His Majesty...
He trusted you above anyone else.
Just as I trusted your father long ago,
Do you know that His Majesty trusts and depends on you?
- My Lord.
- My Lord.
At sunrise, go to the Police Bureau and fetch me all the records on the Sword Fraternity.
What?
The Sword Fraternity?
- Why that all of a sudden?
- Just do as you're told!
Then we'll bring it.
He's in a bad mood.
I am an officer of this nation's government, Lady Chun.
So even though this will cause great chaos...
So even though this will cause great chaos,
I cannot keep this from His Majesty.
Will you...
Will you allow me to tell him?
Please...
Please let me tell His Majesty myself.
If you do that, then you may feel better.
But what about His Majesty?
Can't you understand how he will feel when he hears the truth from your own lips?
Your Majesty...!
Your Majesty, it is already past midnight.
Is it?
Is it so late already?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Will you go to Lady Chun's residence tonight?
No, it's better that I don't.
She looks troubled around me.
I don't want to make her uncomfortable in my attempt to comfort her.
- I hope the Chief brings good news.
- Your Majesty...
I'm sure Lady Chun will be all right.
Please don't worry too much.
No lowborn person will have a spotless record.
Yes, you're right.
I have to see Her Majesty.
Announce me!
Everything was as you said it would be.
There were no records of Lady Chun anywhere.
That is sufficient, Your Majesty.
This is enough to back her into a corner!
No, Councilor.
That is not enough.
That would merely trouble His Majesty.
But there is no information to be found.
What else can we do?
Who do you think will be the most nervous right now?
It is Dong Yi, and the people who want to hide her.
Watch them, Lady Yu.
Do you understand, Councilor?
They will tell us who Dong Yi is.
Are these all the records from the Bureau of Properties?
Yes, but I wonder why we can't find any information on Lady Chun?
I'm worried that it'll cause unnecessary suspicion.
I...
I'm not worthy to be with His Majesty.
I can't do that.
I must not do that.
- My Lady!
- What did you say?
I said perhaps we should go and ask her ourselves.
- No, no we can't.
- What?
I'll ask her myself.
Just make sure the girls don't talk about this.
Yes, My Lady.
They were looking for the original copy of the Registration Archive!
Now that we know what they're after,
It's just a matter of time before we get them!
We can destroy them with Lady Chun's original!
- My Lord!
- That may become difficult.
What do you mean, My Lord?
Difficult?
Did something happen to Lady Chun?
The both of you have been acting strange lately.
Please tell me more details.
What did Chief Suh and Lady Chun talk about?
We have no idea either!
But something is definitely wrong.
I have never seen Lady Chun so ashen and pale in my years of knowing her!
Oh, it's heavy!
Dusty too!
The pages are yellow with age!
Why do you think the Chief wants to see these records about the Sword Fraternity?
I'm not sure either.
I thought he'd forgotten about them.
Why does he want to look at these anyway!
Look at this dust!
Damn it, they're heavy!
- You're coming in now?
- Yes, I'm a little late.
Where have you been?
We've been so busy here without you!
Please forgive me, sir.
What is all that?
Nothing important.
They're old records.
- Old records?
- That's right!
This is so tiring!
Sir...!
"The Sword Fraternity"
Chief Suh took old records from the Police Bureau?
Yes, Your Majesty.
They were records on past incidents.
What incidents were they?
- Tell Lord Jang to come to the Palace!
- Yes, My Lady.
Records on the Sword Fraternity?
Why would Chief Suh want those records?
My Lord!
You were nowhere to be seen yesterday.
- Where have you been?
- I went to Sungchun for Dong Yi.
- Sungchun?
- Yes.
The documents of her lineage were being kept there.
Indeed?
How surprising that those documents were in Sungchun.
Corpse-handler Choi Hyo Won.
That is who I know her father to be.
My Lord!
What?
Someone from the Office of the Inspector-General wishes to speak to us?
That's right.
So it's you two!
I can tell right away!
You really do look like a bean sprout and a dimwit!
What?
You have to help me.
I need to find out something!
Come with me!
- Who is that?
Do you know him?
- I've never seen him before.
Why is he calling me a dimwit?
I know!
He looks like a chewed up dog bone!
Why are you just standing there?
I'm in a hurry!
Come along!
I'm going to just...!
Don't try to stop me!
How did you find out?
Lady Chun told me.
Both you and Lady Chun will be dealt with according to the law.
I don't want to see you hurt.
I hope you will comply.
Please turn a blind eye to Dong Yi, My Lord!
It has nothing to do with her!
Please don't let her be punished for something that isn't her fault!
- My Lord!
- Don't you know the law?
Isn't that the reason why she hid her true identity?
My Lord!
I have to do this.
It has to be me.
Madam Bong.
- Did you summon me, My Lady?
- Yes.
- I wish to see His Majesty.
- Right now?
Can you see if he can see me now?
Do you know how it feels when you've put your faith in a lie?
Do you know how it feels when someone you trusted betrays you?
- My Lord!
- That is what Choi Hyo Won did to me.
It wasn't the Chief!
It wasn't the Sword Fraternity who did those things twelve years ago!
It wasn't us who assassinated the nobles or killed your father!
- What use are claims of innocence now?
- They are not claims!
It's the truth!
You said you put your faith in a lie.
No, you're wrong!
You're the one who betrayed the Chief!
What?
You were swayed so easily by false testimonies.
Your trust in him fell so quickly!
I wanted to believe him.
I would have believed what he said.
But he never denied it!
Because he believe that was the only way to protect you!
- What?
- So that you wouldn't investigate further!
He did it to protect you!
That was how much the Chief trusted you.
He believed that you would find out the truth one day.
That is why he confessed to his closest friend that he killed his father!
My father...!
Was it really you who killed him?
Could he really...?
Could he really have...?
Chun...
- No musicians by the name of Chun?
- No, sir.
I'm right, I tell you.
There were no musicians twelve years ago by the name of Chun.
What's going on?
Sulhee told me she was the sister of a royal musician.
- The dead!
- What?
Did anyone die that year?
Let's see...
Musicians who died...
Yes, there was someone who was killed!
But he wasn't a Chun, he was a Choi!
What?
That incident caused a big chaos in the capital!
What incident?
- Lady Chun is here?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Bring her in!
Welcome!
Your Majesty, I hope I'm not interrupting your work.
Not at all!
I missed you so much I couldn't work.
Come and sit down!
What?
Lady Chun has gone to see His Majesty?
Yes, sir.
You've been looking so troubled lately, but I am glad to see you looking less burdened.
- Do I, Your Majesty?
- Yes.
Now I feel less worried.
Now I can finally smile too!
What a fool I am.
I am King and yet I cry and laugh depending on your expression!
Your Majesty...
But it's all good.
I have never been so anxious before.
I have only you to thank for making me feel like a real man.
But I'm not asking you to smile when you don't feel like it.
What is it, Dong Yi?
You seem like you want to tell me something.
So it was the Sword Fraternity.
I remember them.
They were assassinating nobles.
Their Chief also murdered your father.
Yet in the beginning, you defended the Chief.
You...
I don't know the details, nor do I want to.
But I felt that I should tell you something.
Lady Chun is in the Grand Palace now.
What?
If you have any desire to turn things around,
You're the only one who can do it.
Am I wrong?
What is it, Dong Yi?
What makes you hesitate so much?
No, don't say anything.
I told you before.
If it's too difficult, you don't have to tell me...
I...
I'm a criminal's daughter.
What?
I'm a criminal's daughter, Your Majesty.
Dong Yi...
What I couldn't say to you that day on the cliff is this.
My deceased father and brother...
- committed a grave sin against our nation.
- Dong Yi!
Your Majesty, it is I.
What is it?
Chief Suh is urgently requesting to see you.
Chief Suh?
What is it about?
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.
It is such an urgent matter that I could not wait for your permission.
- You...!
- My Lord!
- Please let me...
- Please leave us, My Lady.
Did you forget?
I told you I had to do this.
Dong Yi...!
Chun Soo...!
Dong Yi...
Do you remember the Sword Fraternity, Your Majesty?
- Sword Fraternity?
- Yes.
Wasn't that the secret lowborn organization... who were wiped out for assassinating nobles?
I remember giving orders to punish them severely according to the law.
Why do you ask?
That is what Lady Chun was just about to tell you.
What?
What is this?
Documents from Sungchun confirming Lady Chun's slave status.
The documents show that her father, Chun Moo-Jin and her mother, Kim Go-Mi were sold as slaves to the gisaeng house at Sungchun.
Then what is this about the Sword Fraternity?
Why was Dong Yi trying to tell me that?
Lady Chun was not originally from Sungchun.
As you expected, her parents were runaway slaves.
When their lives were in danger,
They received help from the Sword Fraternity and escaped.
That is what Lady Chun was trying to tell you.
Although they did it to keep their lives,
She considers it a crime to have accepted their help.
Is this it?
Is this why she has been suffering so much?
Sir, you mean that Chief Suh is giving the documents I brought to His Majesty?
That's right.
The past will be buried, so don't worry.
The Chief of the Sword Fraternity's daughter...
She must be out of the ordinary because she is her father's daughter.
Sir!
Don't worry!
I may be careless, but I can keep a secret.
In any case,
If I couldn't do what I wanted because of my status,
I would have turned to the sword too.
Because that's what a man does.
But don't turn me in.
I want to advance in my career!
Why did you do that?
Don't you understand that...
You've now committed an unpardonable crime against His Majesty too?
My Lord...!
Do you remember that day?
You told me your father died a wrongful death.
I won't let a criminal's daughter escape again.
So don't ever let me see you again.
He's not a criminal!
My father didn't do it, sir!
I saw the signal.
The Inspector-General's signal...
I saw the court lady do it too!
You said it was important!
Find the lady and ask her.
That is perhaps the reason why I searched for you for so long.
I couldn't let go of my faith in your father.
My Lord...
If that is the truth, then I know what really happened.
If he really took responsibility for my father's death in order to protect me.
Then it's my turn now.
I will accept full responsibility... for my crime against His Majesty for his sake.
But remember this.
This isn't for you to do.
I will take responsibility for what I did, but you must never tell His Majesty.
My Lord!
This isn't for your sake, but for His Majesty.
You once said that you were unworthy to be in this position.
But there must be a reason why you have been given this position.
There must be something you must do.
So you must do that at His Majesty's side, do you hear me?
You must stake your life and never be found out.
You must repay His Majesty's faith in you with even more faith in him.
My Lord...
It may be in the past, but the Sword Fraternity cannot be forgiven.
It is still a fact that you and Choi Hyo Won... tried to shake the foundations of our nation.
I know that.
But while Lady Chun is here, you must be here to protect her.
I will carry the burden of my friend's crime.
What you and Lady Chun have to do is to forget what happened.
Remember what I said.
Father...
Older brother...
- You're here, sir.
- Is His Lordship inside?
Yes, sir.
Hee-Jae, what's going on?
Is everything going smoothly?
- My Lord, your man is here.
- Send him in.
Yes, My Lord.
How did it go?
Did you find the Registration Archive?
We... we haven't found it.
What?
Is that what you're here to tell me?
Forgive me, My Lord.
But there is something more urgent.
- More urgent?
- Lord Jin wants the original by tomorrow!
I think he has figured out something is wrong.
- What?
- Hee-Jae!
What do we do?
What did you say?
They submitted documents of her birth?
Yes, we could find nothing wrong with the documents.
Councilor, what about the Sword Fraternity?
Chief Suh was said to have reviewed records about it.
There must be some connection with the Sword Fraternity!
I have some men working on it already, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, Lord Jang Hee-Jae is here.
What is it, Brother?
Well, I...
Your Majesty.
What is wrong?
Is there something I can't know about?
Councilor, please leave us for a while.
What?
Go and find out what Jang Hee-Jae is up to these days.
We should be focusing on Lady Chun...
Something major has gone wrong.
Find out what it is!
- Yes, Uncle.
Let's go.
- Yes, sir.
What did you say?
They may have the original Registration Archive?
I was right all along.
That Shim Woon-Taek is up to something!
Up to something?
At first I felt they would have taken action if they really had the original.
But I misjudged them.
I'm certain they were waiting for more concrete evidence.
- Your Majesty, I will skin them alive and...
- Did you say tomorrow?
Is the Qing deadline tomorrow?
Yes, Your Majesty.
First you must compose yourself, Brother.
If you get too excited now, it's all over.
You must do this if you don't want to lose everything.
But, Your Majesty...!
If they have the Registration Archive, then all we have to do is get it back.
Get it back?
Go inside and look further.
Who goes there!
Who are you?
What?
The Qing Emissary was spying on the fortress being built on Mt.
Ganghwa?
Yes, Your Majesty.
I have just heard unpleasant news.
Is that what you were after, Emissary?
You used the Crown Prince's acknowledgement... to buy our favor and then secretly spy on our defenses?
This is a misunderstanding, Your Majesty.
We were just...
Pardon me, Your Majesty...
But isn't it Joseon that tried to buy our favor with another motive in mind?
- What?
- Now look here, Lord Jin!
Please forgive me, Your Excellency.
But the mountain fortress in Mt.
Ganghwa...
Shouldn't you have consult us before you put up the fortress walls along our border?
Are you telling me that I should get Qing's permission before I raise a wall on my land?
Your Majesty...
Fine.
If you're so curious, I won't stop you.
Take your soldiers and have a look around.
How about the border?
What if the land we were talking about was the border land between Joseon and Qing?
We have heard rumors that armies are being dispatched to the border lands.
Is that not true?
Lord Jin!
There is a reason why they are raising this issue with the border lands.
- Find out what the reason is!
- Yes, Your Majesty!
What do you mean by Qing's ulterior motive for wanting the Registration Archive?
They're not causing this commotion for a mere book.
What they are really after is the information in that book regarding our defense.
Qing fears the growth of the Joseon army.
They want the information in that book so that they can restrain us.
Are you saying that Qing may threaten us if they get their hands on this information?
Yes, My Lady.
The Joseon Army had been weakened due to Qing's intimidating tactics.
His Majesty intends to return the Joseon army to its original glory.
This act of theirs will prevent that from happening.
So this isn't merely about giving them defense secrets.
This is high treason.
We must guard the Registration Archive no matter what it takes.
We have to use this to cripple them, My Lady.
But how?
How can we prove that they tried to give it to Qing?
I have a plan, My Lady.
But it may put us in danger too.
This is a letter from Lady Chun to you, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, what does it say?
Lady Chun is preparing for a major event.
What?
She has?
It may be the final battle between myself and Consort Hui.
Your Majesty, you mean you tried to give Qing the Registration Archive?
Yes, that's right.
But that's too...!
Yes, I know.
I know it was dangerous.
But it is His Majesty who is not accepting reality.
Joseon and Qing must be allies, not enemies.
So it is more important to earn their trust.
But if His Majesty finds out about this, you will not be able to escape his wrath!
But what can be done now?
Your horse is already galloping.
Are you saying you want to jump off now?
If your answer is no, then you must help me.
If we all want to live, that is.
My Lady, His Majesty is here.
Your Majesty...
Your Majesty...
It's been a long day.
I've been so busy with the Qing Emissary... that I haven't had time to see how you were doing.
Please don't trouble yourself with me, Your Majesty.
Chief Suh told me everything.
I finally understand why you've been so troubled.
- Your Majesty...
- But don't be too worried.
I know it's not your father's fault nor yours.
Perhaps it is my fault as King.
This nation is a society made up of high and low classes.
The wealthy exploit the poor to get even more wealth.
Even though I was King, I couldn't take care of the lowborn class.
I swore to myself that I would help all my people.
But my help didn't extend all the way to them.
You're wrong, Your Majesty.
You cherish your people.
Did you already forget?
It was you who took a lowborn slave and gave her your heart.
Yes, I did.
That's why I've been thinking that...
That is the very reason why Heaven sent you to me.
Heaven doesn't want me to forget that the lowborn are also my people.
That is my duty as King.
I have to hear their cries of suffering through you.
Your Majesty...!
This will be the sign, so use it.
Everything has to happen at the designated time.
You must focus, Brother.
The blade is already at our throats.
If we don't swing first, it is finished for us.
Don't worry, Your Majesty.
It will be done as you say.
The future of the South Faction hangs in the balance.
We have to gather them at one place and finish everything there.
Will you all risk your lives for this?
- Yes, Brother!
- Yes, Your Excellency!
You want to hold a banquet for the Qing Emissary?
Yes, Your Majesty.
I have heard that the Qing Emissary and his men are angry because of what happened.
If they return to Qing in that state, I fear for our two nations' relationship.
Shouldn't we try to appease them before they return to Qing?
Your Majesty, Lord Jang is correct.
This is a matter of diplomacy.
You must appease them before they leave.
What is this about a banquet all of a sudden?
The Qing Emissary is here.
It will be a very important event.
Yes, this will be the most important banquet we have ever prepared for!
- Why is that?
- Because there is something we have to do!
What?
What's that?
- You see...
- Stop wagging your tongue!
What is it, My Lord?
I'm so curious!
You're just a woman!
Why should we tell you!
Go inside!
Y.. yes, My Lord.
What is he talking about?
I'm to participate in today's banquet too?
Yes, the Queen has ordered you to come.
Why would she invite me to such an event?
I'm not sure, but perhaps she has realized that soon you'll be part of the Royal Family, and that she'll have to accept you?
My Lady, you have to be beautiful!
You and Jung-Im will take the girls... and manage the customs of the banquet per the instructions.
But isn't that a role for you, Madam Chief?
I won't be Madam Chief forever,
So you should learn some of these duties now.
Make sure you don't make any mistakes.
How is it going?
They are going to guard the place as ordered.
The Royal Guard and the Office of Investigations will both have their hands full.
- And Shim Woon-Taek?
- I've already sent men to take care of him.
- Who are you?
- Get him!
Yes, sir!
Are they here too?
Yes, since the banquet is in the Palace, the Royal Guard is on duty.
- Come with me!
- Yes, sir!
You must hurry!
If you're late, everything will be for naught.
- Yes, Madam Chief.
- We understand, Madam Chief.
What do you mean, Dong Yi?
Something is amiss?
- Everyone is here.
- What?
Lady Jung and myself.
Even you and Chief Suh.
Don't you think it's strange that all of us are here?
What about Lord Shim Woon-Taek?
Have you seen him?
But this isn't an event he can participate in.
- Please find out where he is right now.
- All right.
My Lady.
There is something strange about this.
I'll go find out.
My Lady!
Are you all right?
- I have to return to my residence.
- What?
Where are you going, Lady Chun?

Episode 32
~ Reads Chinese philosophy by Confucius...
Confucius said, "To be ignorant and act recklessly,"
"to be of low rank and live lawlessly,"
"to live in the present and dwell in the past,"
"all this will bring trouble."
Your Majesty...!
All right.
Let's move on.
You seem preoccupied.
Shall we conclude the session?
Preoccupied?
I heard everything.
~ Recites Chapter 28 of Confucius' Doctrine of the Mean ~
Besides, you said a character wrong.
Please forgive me, Your Majesty!
I made a mistake during the recitation.
Let's move on.
Deliver my orders to the Bureau of Capital Markets.
- And I want a report from the Ministry of War.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
How is the reform of the military service doing?
The Three Offices are awaiting you at the Grand Hall to discuss that very issue, Your Majesty.
- Indeed?
Let's go.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Don't bring out the parasol anymore.
Your Majesty?
I want a tan.
A man shouldn't be too pale, don't you think?
My Lady!
My Lady!
Where did she go now?
There are so many things to learn in the Inner Court!
The Office of Investigations was nothing compared to this!
- My Lady!
- My Lady!
I'm over here!
My Lady!
I'm really sorry, but I felt so stuffy inside.
- When you go somewhere, please tell us!
- I forgot.
And My Lady, how many times do we have to tell you to talk informally to us?
I forgot that too...!
Are you unwell?
You don't look good.
No, I'm fine.
Please don't be concerned about me.
Please rest today.
I'll speak to My Lady and...
I mean I'll speak to Lady Jang.
- There's no need for that, My Lady!
- You will obey!
- My Lady...!
- It's good to be superior at times like this!
By the way, why were you looking for me?
I have to select my attendants?
Yes, My Lady.
Once your residence is ready, you will have to move.
When that happens, the ladies who are serving you now will return to their original duties.
Is that so?
You will need your own attendants.
Do you have anyone in mind?
No, not at all.
Since these attendants will always be with you, it's best to select those you are already familiar with.
I see.
- Is that so?
- I'm so envious!
You mean Dong Yi is really going to be a Special Court Lady?
That's what I said!
I just saw it with my own eyes!
The other girls are saying that it's a matter of time before Dong Yi is made a Royal Consort!
They say His Majesty is completely enamored of her!
That means she'll be given her own attendants!
I wonder who will go?
I'm so envious!
Envious of what?
Why not?
Attendants advance along with their mistress!
That depends on the mistress!
If she's cast off, then her attendants are too!
No matter how hard she tries, she's still going against the Queen.
And besides, does she have any supporters in government?
Advance?
Wait and see.
She'll be exiled out of the Palace within a month.
Then it'll be the end for her attendants too!
Maybe you're right...
We'll come here.
What?
Both of you?
The other girls won't be able to come forward so easily.
Everyone is cautious of offending the Queen.
Then what about the Office of Investigations?
Both of you are Lady Investigators!
It is more important that we protect you.
My Lady!
The Inner Court is a fearsome place, My Lady.
Lives can come and go because of an errant word.
Besides, the Queen is trying to harm you, and she is still its chief.
If you want to survive, you will need people you can trust.
I know, but I do not wish for you to give up your dreams because of me.
My Lady...
If I need people I can trust, then I'll find them myself.
Do you remember when I first joined the Office of Investigations?
It seemed hopeless just like now.
But just as I found the two of you,
I will find someone here who will open their hearts to me.
What should we do?
We must respect her wishes.
The circumstances aren't favorable.
Everyone knows the Queen is against her.
Even if they are sent to her, they may work against her.
What will you do, Uncle?
Will you just sit and watch?
Don't over-react.
After all, she's only a lowborn girl with no influence in government.
But if His Majesty continues to show her favor, her influence will soon grow!
That is why we must stop her before that happens.
Find out what that lowborn wench did before she entered the Palace.
There is no one in this world who is untainted.
Find anything that can be used against her.
Do you understand?
Yes, Uncle.
Is she even worthy of being the Queen's opponent?
She is merely a lowborn girl.
She has accomplished things we thought impossible.
We must not let our guard down.
Find out everything about her.
Do you understand?
Yes, My Lord.
And Jang Hee-Jae, what is he up to?
I heard that he was demoted to work at the Bureau of Hospitality.
The Bureau of Hospitality?
The office responsible for preparing banquets?
Yes, My Lord.
Bureau of Hospitality (Responsible for guests of the Palace)
So we meet here, My Lord!
This is the first time I've seen you since the Police Bureau!
I'm working at different bureaus to learn how to govern a nation.
- Here, escort the guests inside.
- Yes, My Lord.
Please come with me.
Those little...!
What the hell am I doing here!
- You...!
- My Lord, what are you doing here?
So you've come.
So it's true that you were sent to the Bureau of Hospitality!
Goodness!
How did that happen?
You were once in charge of the Police Bureau, but now you're running errands for visitors!
How frustrating for you!
I know!
The Bureau of Hospitality is lower in rank than the Bureau of Music!
What?
We have people waiting for us, so we're off.
How dare they mock me!
- My Lord!
- Be silent!
You have gathered important people here, but the banquet is sorely lacking!
What?
The banquet!
The table is lacking.
The previous official wasn't this bad.
You better improve on...
Stuff your mouths with what you're given!
Why... why are you doing this?
Don't let my words aggravate you.
You shouldn't aggravate me!
What a ruffian!
Let's go.
Why did you do that, Brother?
You need restraint now more than ever!
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.
But my blood boils when I think of that wench!
I can't bear it!
Brother.
Your Majesty, let me take her life and then mine.
Don't say such things!
This will be a long battle.
You must prepare yourself!
- But Your Majesty...!
- We have the Crown Prince.
No matter what the circumstances, His Majesty loves his son.
If Qing sends their official recognition and he finds out of your contribution, he will summon you again.
No one knows of the Registration Archive, so you can claim all the credit!
But it's worrisome that Qing's recognition of the Crown Prince is so delayed.
We should have heard something from Qing by now.
That's why you need to focus on that.
Do you understand?
Yes, Your Majesty.
This is the original copy of the Registration Archive.
Lord Jang Hee-Jae tried to pass this to Qing and obtain recognition for the Crown Prince.
The man who risked his life to protect this is still in Uiju.
This is our last chance to prove their guilt.
I'll go to Uiju with Officer Cha and find out more about this.
It's critical that you protect Lord Shim Woon-Taek's life.
Please, My Lord.
All right.
Don't worry.
Chun Soo!
How have you fared, My Lady?
Chun Soo!
Why are you calling me that?
It's the law.
Before the law, I'm your sister Dong Yi.
Yes, you're my sister.
Yes, so please don't address me as My Lady when you're with me.
Everyone seems so uncomfortable around me.
I don't want you to feel the same way!
Has it been difficult?
It's uncomfortable and awkward and a little lonely.
It must be because it's not that easy to meet anyone now.
Do you want to give up everything now?
Say the word and I'll take you out right now.
What?
I'm just joking.
I know you'll never leave the Palace.
And now you must not.
Chun Soo...
At least now I can leave with peace of mind.
Because His Majesty is with you.
My Lord!
Be careful on your journey, My Lord.
It would be safer if I went with you!
Chun Soo, take good care of him!
This is a secret mission.
Don't make such a commotion!
Yes, My Lord!
- Let's go.
- Yes, My Lord.
Have a safe journey!
I know you'll never leave the Palace.
And now, you must not.
Did something happen?
Two of the palace maidens have fallen sick, My Lady.
What?
Who?
- How are they?
- My Lady, you must not be here!
Please go!
- What?
- It is a mysterious illness.
It can be contagious!
What is happening here?
To tell you the truth, Jung-Geum has been sick since she was assigned here.
Then why didn't you say anything?
We thought it was a cold and that it would go away with some medicine.
We didn't know her roommate would get it too.
- We don't want to get sick!
- Please transfer me somewhere else!
- That residence has a mysterious plague!
- We don't want to die!
What is all this noise?
Why is it so noisy over here?
They are palace maidens that were sent to serve Lady Chun.
Why are they here?
Please give us another assignment, Madam Chief!
We're afraid we're going to get sick too!
We'll go anywhere you send us.
Just don't send us to Lady Chun!
There may be some issues with assigning your attendants, My Lady.
Issues?
Because of the palace maidens who are sick?
The girls are worried at rumors that the illness is contagious.
But the other girls here are fine.
Once the two girls have recovered, the rumors will go away.
As we mentioned before, the two of us...
My Lady, it is Lady Jang.
My Lady, Lady Investigators are here to see you.
Lady Investigators?
My Lady!
- Byun-hee!
- Ae-Jong!
My Lady, Lady Chun!
What brings you here?
We wanted to see you and talk to Lady Jung too...
Why?
You mean you'll do it?
Yes, the two of you are important members here.
You should remain here.
Truthfully, Lady Bong and I, we are dispensable here.
It's only right that we go.
Hey, you may be, but I'm not dispensable!
In any case, we'll do.
We'll sacrifice ourselves for Dong...
I mean Lady Chun!
She's right.
But no one wants to do this...
That's why I said sacrifice!
Sacrifice!
Thank you, Byunhee!
You've made a big decision!
Thank me for what?
Ae-Jong!
We're in!
But you know, I'm a little worried.
- About what?
- I heard about the mysterious disease!
- I bet diseases are more scared of you.
- My Lady!
Don't worry!
Illness is a part of life!
Are we doing the right thing?
What if Dong Yi gets exiled and sent away?
That means the end for us too!
Look, I took Dong Yi's birthdate and got her fortune told.
She's an ascending dragon!
It says to ride on her back no matter what!
- We have to get on!
- What if we fall off?
That's why it's a challenge and an adventure!
It's all or nothing!
Yes, life is a gamble!
Let's do it!
- Ae-Jong!
- My Lady!
- My Lady.
- How is it going?
It appears to be going well.
Report this to Madam.
Make sure it's discreet.
Yes, My Lady.
- So a few of her attendants have gotten sick?
- Yes, Madam.
Good.
Now all we have to do is wait.
But will everything go well?
What if things go wrong like last time...
Don't worry.
That will never happen.
They will never find out what is the cause.
That little vixen...
How dare she go after the Queen?
She will suffer just as much as Her Majesty has!
I will make His Majesty send her away with his own hand!
Indeed?
Dong Yi's residence is finally ready?
Yes, Your Majesty.
That is good news.
But there might be a delay in moving to the new residence, Your Majesty.
A delay?
Why?
A few of her attendants have fallen sick and that seems to have caused a problem.
Sick?
Is Dong Yi all right?
Yes, she seems fine.
That is good to hear.
So...
I fear you may have to wait a little for that day...
Your first night with Lady Chun, Your Majesty.
You've been waiting for the day she moved into the new residence.
What... what are you talking about?
I have done no such thing!
I said I haven't!
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.
In any case, Dong Yi must be troubled if her attendants have fallen sick.
But that's what being a superior is about.
To tell you the truth, Jung-Geum has been sick since she was sent here.
She's over there.
Chief Eunuch!
My Lady!
What brings you here?
Chief Eunuch, where are we going?
And what about these clothes?
You are well-acquainted with the place.
Please don't worry.
You keep bringing me clothes and surprising me.
How can I help but to worry?
I only do what His Majesty commands me, My Lady.
- Your Majesty!
- Fine.
Your Majesty!
You're here, Dong Yi!
- My Lady!
- My Lady!
- Sirs!
- Come and have a seat.
Your Majesty, what's going on?
I thought you might feel cooped up, so I wanted to let you have some air.
Am I wrong?
You used to frolic about like a Poongsan dog.
But being cooped up in the Palace must have been driving you crazy.
Your Majesty...!
We've been wanting to see Lady Chun too, so we ran when we heard you summoned us.
I know.
They really ran here immediately.
Such senseless fellows.
Why is the wine so bitter today?
- He kept telling me to hurry.
- You were the one who rushed here!
Drink up!
He wanted to run here.
Are you still here?
- What?
- We... we were just about to leave...
- Sirs!
Sirs...
- It's a joke!
Why are you so easy to fool?
Or am I just really good?
I really can't figure him out!
Here, Dong Yi, have some wine.
When can we otherwise share a drink together?
Stupid boy!
She's "My Lady" to you!
- I keep forgetting, My Lady!
- It's all right, Sir.
I have a hard time changing the way I talk too.
Just continue until you get used to it.
Your Majesty, please have some wine too.
Dong Yi!
Dong Yi!
Dong Yi!
You have to understand.
How can I change the way I address you so suddenly?
Your Majesty, he's drunk.
Please understand.
It's all right.
We're here to have fun, aren't we?
See?
Even His Majesty understands!
So Dong Yi, have some wine too!
Drink up!
- Drink up!
- All right, Sir!
You!
Your hand!
What?
Do you know whose hand you're holding?
Your Majesty!
Please... please forgive me!
I deserve death!
So you know you deserve death for what you just did!
I'll have your hand cut off!
What?
My hand?
Guard!
Bring me a straw-cutter!
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty...!
I have given an order!
Your Majesty, you're going to cut off his hand?
Why would you do that?
Why?
I can't do that?
Your Majesty!
It's a joke!
I made another joke!
Your Majesty!
You're so mean!
How can you make a joke like that?
I thought my heart would burst!
It wasn't a complete joke.
I was furious for a second.
Your Majesty, I'll never touch Dong...
I mean Her Ladyship again!
All right.
I'm sorry I scared you.
Have a drink.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I was terrified for a second, but I'm still happy.
You are?
About what?
Because you care so deeply for her.
Sir...
Your Majesty, please cherish her always.
If you'll do that, I'll break his hand off myself!
Wait, not my hand!
Yes, don't worry about that.
I swear it as a man.
Thank you, Your Majesty!
Thank you, Your Majesty!
Here.
Let's drink up!
Your Majesty...!
- Your Majesty!
- I'm fine.
- Protect His Majesty!
- Yes, My Lord!
Goodness!
What a thing to happen!
I know.
This is my fault that...
Not at all.
Why would you say such a thing?
Why is it doing that again?
Your Majesty, are you unwell?
- No, I'm fine.
- But you're clutching your chest!
- Perhaps the rain has made you unwell?
- No, I'm really fine.
Your Majesty!
Why is it...?
Chief Eunuch!
Yes, Your Majesty?
Has the palanquin arrived yet?
It has arrived, but the winds are strong and it might be dangerous for you to return now.
What?
How long do I have to go through this?
We should wait until the winds have died down.
Goodness...
This is a disaster.
Does that mean we have to stay here?
Your Majesty...
I know.
This is...
Are you really all right?
I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.
His Majesty has been waiting so long for her residence to be ready...
But it's to be at an inn?
What do you mean, My Lord?
Nothing.
His Majesty won't be returning to the Palace tonight.
Make sure security is tight.
Yes, My Lord.
- Tighten up security.
- Yes, My Lord.
Well...
Goodness...
It looks like we won't be returning to the Palace tonight.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
It's my fault you're staying in such a humble place.
Not at all.
Why would you say that?
I feel like you're always having to suffer, when you're around me.
Suffer?
But I've never been unhappy when I was with you.
Why would you even say such a thing?
Your Majesty...!
Why is it so hot in here?
My throat is so parched.
I'll pour it for you!
Yes, why don't you do that...
- Dong Yi.
- What?
It's going to overflow.
- What?
- It's going to overflow.
Look!
Oh no... no...!
Please forgive me, Your Majesty!
Where's... where's the towel?
Please forgive me, Your Majesty!
I've made a mistake again!
I don't know what's wrong with me.
- Dong Yi.
- Yes?
Cosmetics Shop
- Oh, Madam!
- Welcome, Madam.
- Here we meet again!
- I know.
I was worried about you, but I'm glad!
Worried?
I heard a new Special Court Lady was appointed!
And she's someone the Queen had under her wing!
If she becomes pregnant, that would really be the end for the Queen!
How dare you...!
You have all those troubles, and yet you find the time to go shopping for cosmetics!
You're truly a remarkable woman!
Stop worrying about me and take care of your own matters!
Do you think powder will make a difference?
No wonder your husband strays.
What did you say?
- Is he inside?
- Yes, Madam.
Please come with me.
That... that lowborn wench...!
Your Majesty, it is Lady Cho.
You mean there are now more palace maidens who are sick at Dong Yi's residence?
Yes, Your Majesty.
The Palace is abuzz with commotion.
Why would this happen?
It's because she's bad luck.
- What if we get it too?
- I don't want to get sick!
How are they?
I've tried every treatment possible, but there is no improvement, My Lady.
My Lady, it is surely contagious!
You must not stay here.
They are my attendants.
How can I not be at their side?
- My Lady!
- My Lady!
- My Lady...
- What is it?
I have bad news.
Other palace maidens have also fallen ill.
What?
Where?
Qing is being very slow in sending its acknowledgment of the Crown Prince.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Didn't the Crown Prince's uncle Jang Hee-Jae meet with them to try and gain speed on this matter?
Yes, Your Majesty.
I heard he tried to use his contacts in Qing to try and speed up the process.
But it appears to have been of no use.
This is not good.
The Crown Prince's position won't be stable unless he receives Qing's recognition.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty, I have terrible news!
What is it?
There is a problem at the East Palace!
What?
Your Majesty!
What happened?
I heard the Prince's attendants have collapsed!
It's the same mysterious illness that started at Lady Chun's residence!
Where's the Prince?
Is he all right?
Fortunately, the Crown Prince appears to be healthy.
But the East Palace* is in chaos.
(*Residence of the Crown Prince)
His Majesty has also left for the East Palace after hearing the news.
- He has?
- Yes.
My Lady, I fear that this will harm you.
Harm me?
What do you mean?
Hey!
Did you hear the news?
The East Palace has the plague too!
I'm so scared!
- But did you hear this too?
- What?
That Dong Yi may be responsible?
- What do you mean?
- Didn't you know?
People are saying she is trying to kill the Crown Prince!
Oh my goodness!
They say she did it to her own attendants first to avoid suspicion, but her target is the Crown Prince!
That's enough!
She scared me!
Eun-Geum, don't you know you have to watch what you say?
We're Lady Investigators!
That's why we're talking about suspicious things!
What?
Don't you think that it's strange that this is happening after she became Special Court Lady?
It's obvious that she's trying to get rid of the Crown Prince for her future child!
Eun-Geum!
I'm glad the Crown Prince is healthy.
- Take the Crown Prince outside.
- Yes.
So no one knows how this happened?
That is correct, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, are you aware that this disease started from Lady Chun's residence?
My Queen, that is...!
Don't worry, Your Majesty.
I'm not going to say that she's responsible for the disease.
That is merely gossip and superstitious talk from Palace Maidens.
But if Lady Chun does not wish to be the target of further gossip, this must be taken care of.
So what is it that you want to do?
This is a matter of the Inner Court.
Therefore, I wish to handle it.
May I do so?
What should I do?
This mysterious illness is only being spread amongst the palace maidens.
Therefore, it is a matter of the Inner Court and thus appropriate for the Queen to handle.
Summon Madam Chief Yu.
Yes, Your Majesty.
My Lady, I fear that this will harm you.
My attendants do not use the same well as those from the East Palace.
Then how did the illness spread?
Why is it only affecting the palace maidens?
Why?
Pyong An Province, Uiju
- Let's hurry.
- Yes, My Lord.
What do you mean he's not here?
Two hours ago, guards came from the provincial office, with orders to move him to a different location.
Do you know where they took him?
Let's rest a while!
I'm exhausted!
Why am I being moved?
And in the middle of a rainy night to boot?
We're just following orders.
We don't know.
Is that so?
I wonder where I'm being moved to?
You're going to Nampo.
Nampo?
I like Nampo!
I hope I'm staying with a rich family!
Let's go.
All right, I'm coming.
Stay back!
You should come quietly!
Would you do that if you were me?
You're not going to Nampo, but to the underworld!
Who goes there!
Get him!
Let's go!
Are you Shim Woon-Taek?
- Do you know me?
- Dong Yi sent us.
Dong...
Dong Yi?
Impudent Bean!
She sent you to me?
What happened?
Why were they trying to kill you?
The Qing emissary passed through Uiju today.
What?
Since the Qing emissary will be arriving at the capital, they must have wanted to silence me.
The Qing emissary?
Is it because of the Crown Prince's recognition?
I don't know if it's just a regular emissary or a special one bringing the Qing recognition.
Seunghee!
My Lady!
- Did you find out what I asked?
- Yes, we looked at their meal plans and their medicine.
But there was no common factor.
Is that so?
Forgive us for not finding anything, My Lady.
How can you find out what the physicians have been unable to?
My Lady!
I have terrible news!
What is it?
- What is this about?
- My Lady.
In order to investigate the mysterious illness amongst the palace maidens, we have received orders to search and interrogate everyone.
Health matters should be handled by the Royal Hospital!
Why is the Tribunal handling this?
This illness has spread to the East Palace.
Someone may have tried to harm the Crown Prince, under the guise of an illness and it should be investigated.
What?
What is it?
My Lady, what have we gotten ourselves into?
- You said she was an ascending dragon!
- I don't know!
Maybe that seer was fake!
Are we going to have to take responsibility for everything?
My Lady, I think I have a fever.
- What?
- Feel me.
I do, right?
What if you're contagious?
Go away!
My Lady!
Why is the Minister so late?
I'm sure he's on his way.
Your Majesty, the Minister is here.
Your Majesty...
What is happening?
The situation is worsening.
They have taken her palace maidens for now.
But that is a clear signal meant to threaten Lady Chun.
What is His Majesty doing?
He knows that she is innocent of all of this!
This is a matter of the Inner Court.
His Majesty has no legitimate reason to intervene.
Your Majesty, what should we do?
This is a plot to target Lady Chun.
They mean to frame her just like they did me.
I must speak to the Queen.
What did you just say?
The Queen?
No, My Lady!
You don't know what she'll do to you!
You can't go there!
What?
Dong Yi?
Yes, Your Majesty, she is here.
Go away!
How dare you come here?
Silence!
How dare you speak to her in that manner?
- I'm all right.
- My Lady!
I beg you.
Please speak to Her Majesty again.
That's not possible.
Please go away.
Was the Crown Prince not enough for you?
Do you plan to spread the illness to Her Majesty too?
- Escort her...
- That's enough.
It's been a while.
I never expected you to come here.
So what is it that you want to say?
Please release my attendants that were taken in by the Tribunal for questioning.
They have done nothing wrong.
Being sick is not a crime.
The important thing is to find out why.
Yes, that is why I gave the Tribunal the responsibility of investigating this incident.
Palace maidens have been known to bring in prohibited herbs into the Palace.
You should know this from your time at the Office of Investigations.
My attendants did no such thing.
So you defend your attendants...
You intend to do your duty as their superior?
You have wasted your time.
Everything will be handled by the Office of Investigations and the Tribunal.
So if you really want to do your duty, then go back and take care of the remaining girls.
- Lady Cho, Lady Chun is leaving...
- Your Majesty!
Please give me some time.
If you give me time,
I will prove that the truth is far from what people suspect.
Silence!
Don't you know what this is really about?
This disease put the Crown Prince's life at stake.
So this concerns the Crown Prince's life!
But you want me to give you time?
So if you want me to gamble with the Crown Prince's life, then what will you put up in return?
Will you stake your life on it?
Will that satisfy you, Your Majesty?
What?
If I do so, will you release my attendants?

Today, on the 26th day of the 4th month, in the year 1694,
Lady Chun Dong Yi will be appointed Royal Consort of the 4th Rank.
She will thereby accept this decree.
Royal Consort Chun, as you are now, continue to serve His Majesty with all your heart, and be a pillar within the Inner Court.
I shall obey, Your Majesty.
Congratulations, Your Highness!
Congratulations, Your Highness!
One year later...
Give me the next petition.
This is unacceptable!
Inform the Tribute Bureau to take into account next year's demand and reduce the mandatory rice tributes.
How should we make up the difference?
Use the royal funds first, and in the meantime, find out if taxes can be levied on palace estates and government land.
Yes, Your Majesty, I shall carry out your orders.
What's next?
These are reports sent in from the Secret Inspectors from all the provinces, Your Majesty.
Show them to me.
Your Majesty, your lunch is ready.
I don't have time.
Send it back.
Begin!
You were the most remarkable, Officer Cha!
You honor me, Your Majesty!
- So is that the end of the troop inspection?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- When is the presentation from the Three Offices?
- 3pm, Your Majesty.
Indeed?
That means I have thirty minutes to spare!
You're going to go again, Your Majesty?
What about you?
Don't you want to go with me?
No, Your Majesty, I have duties to attend to.
Is that so?
Then go on your way!
Where is His Majesty going?
Don't you know where he goes whenever he has some free time?
- Has the bath been completed?
- Yes, My Lady.
- It's warm today.
Serve Maximowiczia tea.
- Yes, My Lady.
- My Lady!
My Lady!
- What?
What is it?
- His Majesty is here!
- What?
Again?
- Yes!
- But he was just here two hours ago!
Yes, he's here again!
- Goodness...!
- His Majesty the King!
What is Consort Chun and the Prince doing now?
How can he be so beautiful?
It's all right.
I'll do it.
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, Your Majesty!
The Prince is already trying to talk!
What is it?
Did something happen?
- Your Majesty!
- You're here too, My Queen.
So, did something happen?
Your Majesty, the Prince is already trying to speak!
- Indeed?
Already?
- Yes, Your Majesty!
It was so strange.
I heard it too.
Yes, here...!
Yes...
He's only two months old and he's already trying to speak!
How clever of him!
Yes, that's right.
Say Father!
Father!
His Majesty is here!
This isn't nice enough!
- Send it back.
Bring another one!
- Make sure it has nicer food.
- Yes, My Lady!
- Lady Bong!
Sanghee!
If you're here to see Her Highness, you'll have to wait.
His Majesty is inside.
- What?
Again?
- This is his third time today!
People are going to say that he rules the nation from Consort Chun's palace!
- I know!
- He must really be overjoyed!
Of course he is!
He's been waiting for this child, and he's a boy!
My Lady, Her Highness is here!
Your Highness!
It's been a while, Lady Yu.
Your Highness, what brings you all the way here?
I heard you came to my palace.
Besides, I wanted to speak with you.
Please come this way, Your Highness.
It seems the hospitality at the Office of Investigations is not what it used to be!
My Lady?
Shall I serve you some tea?
Well, I won't stop you if you insist.
Please come this way.
Then shall we have a look around?
Ae-Jong, let's go.
Yes, My Lady.
- Consort Chun has all the power!
- I know.
Who would have known that she would give birth to a son?
We went with the wrong team!
- What if the Crown Prince is re-designated?
- What do you mean by that?
- You didn't hear the rumors?
- What?
Your Highness!
Where is she?
- Your Highness...!
- I asked you where she is!
Die, you bitch!
I pray to all the gods in the heavens!
Please kill Chun Dong Yi and her child!
- Your Highness!
- What are you doing?
Your Highness, I...!
Did you think this would help me or the Crown Prince?
Please forgive me, Your Highness!
We were just worried about you and His Highness!
- Mother!
- Yes, I was the one who made her do it!
I felt like I would die of fury if I didn't!
- Mother!
- Your Highness, there is nothing I wouldn't do.
I would do anything to kill Consort Chun and her child!
Don't you know that people are saying her son will take over the Crown Prince's position?
Doesn't that anger you?
Will you just sit and watch?
Is that why you made them do this childish thing?
How can this change anything?
Do you think I'm sitting here just waiting for time to pass by?
Do you think that without this doll I wouldn't be able to reclaim my position?
No, of course not!
I'm just waiting for the right time.
Your Highness...!
- They wish to speak in private.
Leave us.
- Yes, My Lady.
What... what did you just say?
As I said, if a change of Crown Prince is needed...
Watch your mouth!
How dare you speak of such things before the Queen?
Minister...
That is also what I want.
What...?
Your Majesty...!
I know it is dangerous to speak of such things.
I too have reconsidered when I think of the young age of the present Crown Prince.
Your Majesty...!
If the Crown Prince ascends to the throne while Consort Hui is still in the Palace, it will bring tumult to the government again.
But even so, Consort Chun is from a slave family.
- How can her offspring become...?
- Minister, you will watch your tongue.
Consort Chun's son is also His Majesty's son.
Your Majesty, the West Faction will surely oppose this as well.
Wouldn't it be better if we bring in a new consort from a noble family and crown her child?
No, it has to be Consort Chun's son who ascends to the throne.
That is what I have decided.
It is clear that we need to tread carefully.
But it is also necessary for the future of the royal family.
My Lord, what do you mean by that?
Crown Prince?
I know that I'm treading on dangerous ground.
But you should know by now how it is in the Palace and what kind of person Consort Hui is.
In the Palace, you must possess everything in order to stay alive.
And Consort Hui knows that better than anyone else.
She won't step aside so easily.
And if that happens, who do you think will be in the most danger?
It's no longer the Queen.
It's Consort Chun and the son she gave birth to.
And if that happens, who do you think will be in the most danger?
It's no longer the Queen.
It's Consort Chun and the son she gave birth to.
- When will he be reaching the capital?
- It will be in ten days, Your Highness.
Fine, tell him that it is better to be cautious than to be quick.
Yes, Your Highness.
So, Your Majesty, are you happy with your new son in your arms?
Yes...
I want you to be happy.
Then you'll know what true suffering is.
Be quiet.
I think he's going to fall asleep.
Rascal...
He must be tired.
But he's too curious to sleep.
Look at how wide his eyes are!
Your Majesty, you should retire to your bedchamber too.
No, my fatigue has gone away just looking at the Prince!
By the way, I have something for you, Dong Yi.
Your Majesty, this is...!
Yes, this is his name.
It's Young Soo to signify long life.
Young Soo...
I stayed up nights trying to think of his name, and the only thing I want from him is to live a long life with us.
The Royal Physician has said he is healthy.
And why wouldn't he be?
You used to run around the whole capital too!
Of course!
Actually, I was really worried that he would be weak like you!
What?
Weak?
Haven't you heard from Officer Cha?
I'm not like I used to be!
Really?
He didn't mention anything.
Fine!
At the Prince's 100th day celebration, I'll show you my archery skills!
Don't you faint when you see me hit the bullseye every time!
I'll believe what you say, so can you show me your archery some other time?
I was hoping we could cancel the Prince's 100th day celebration.
Cancel?
What do you mean?
Dong Yi!
You wish to open a welfare office in the capital with the funds for the 100th day celebration?
Yes, Your Majesty.
I heard the famine is so bad that the capital is overflowing with refugees.
I know His Majesty and the government is deeply troubled, and I want to help the people rather than have a lavish party.
But it's the first celebration for the Prince.
It is not a mere party.
The celebration is to pray for blessings and longevity for the Prince.
Yes, that is why I'm making this request.
To receive blessings, one must share blessings too.
The Prince wanted porridge from the Welfare Office even when he was within my womb.
I believe that the Prince would be happy to know that his first act as Prince was to share food with the people.
I can't stand against that kind heart of yours.
- Your Majesty...
- All right then.
If that is what you want, then go ahead.
What can I do to help you?
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir!
What does it say?
Is Consort Chun opening a welfare office or not?
Yes, she is!
Instead of celebrating the Prince's 100th day, she's going to help the people!
What a gracious woman she is!
That's because Her Highness is from the same lowborn class as we are!
She knows how much we suffer.
Yes, she does!
The King is going to give us porridge because the Prince is turning a 100 days!
How wonderful!
Where can I possibly go?
Why do you keep following me everywhere?
We are only doing as we've been commanded.
I have to relieve myself!
Do you want to go with me?
- My Lord!
- The guards are near.
Where is the letter?
Here it is.
Things are going as planned.
Pull it over there!
- Put these over there.
- Yes, My Lady.
- What about these?
- Put more cabbage.
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
What brings you here?
I felt bad that you have to do all the work.
Not at all!
Even so, you didn't have to come here to such a dangerous place!
Dangerous place?
This is where I came to satiate my hunger.
Just give up, Lady Jung!
It won't change her mind.
Look, there's no one left at the Palace!
Thank you, My Lady!
Stand this way!
Come this way!
Go and stand in line!
No one will be turned away, so stand in line!
- Bring more grain from the warehouse.
- Yes, My Lady!
My Lady!
More people came than we expected!
All the attendants from the Office of Investigations and Consort Chun's Palace are helping out, but we're still short-handed!
Speak to the city office and have them send us some servants.
Here!
I was looking forward to His Highness' banquet!
Why do we have to suffer like this!
I feel the same way!
I heard she wants to use royal funds to continue the welfare office!
What if she wants us to make porridge every day?
No!
I didn't quit being a Lady Investigator to make porridge!
This is all your fault!
You talked about dragons and enticed me!
What?
You're the one who wanted to come with me!
Hey!
Why are all of you outside?
Where's Her Highness?
- She told us to help.
- What?
How can you leave her alone?
You're all going to drive me crazy!
Why did you do that?
Your Highness!
I knew it!
She's going to send me to an early grave!
This is what I'm good at.
I can't miss out on the action!
I hope Lady Bong doesn't see me.
Thank you, My Lady!
Don't push me!
- Eat a lot!
- Thank you, My Lady!
Finish this and come back for more!
We have enough for everyone.
- Is that true?
- Of course!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Eat up!
We've run out of porridge!
- Someone bring more rice!
- Yes, sir!
The grain warehouse should be somewhere here.
Sorry!
I'm sorry!
Wait!
You dropped something!
This...!
Did you see a man come through just now?
No, My Lady.
Your Highness!
What are you doing here dressed like that?
I'm sorry, Lady Bong, but I have to go somewhere.
But...!
How could this happen in broad daylight?
Dead...!
Your Highness...!
What?
The Director of the Welfare Office was murdered?
Where was he murdered?
He was stabbed while inspecting the warehouse.
What?
How could this...?
Sir...!
- Where is the body?
- Inside.
Inside?
Let's go, sir.
Whoever did this, it was a massacre!
It looks like an act of vengeance.
The body's been stabbed even after death.
There's something here.
This is it.
This is... a manifesto!
A manifesto?
Your Highness, did you want to see me?
Chun Soo...!
What is it, Your Highness?
You wanted to see me urgently?
You've been to the Welfare Office, haven't you?
It's about the murdered Director.
Yes, I heard you were there as well.
Are you all right?
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I think I saw the man who murdered the director.
What?
You saw him?
But... he dropped this.
- Your Highness, this is...!
- Yes, it's the insignia for the Sword Fraternity.
Relief aid is merely show and not the true way to help the People.
This will not change discrimination against the lowborn by the nobles.
The only way to change things is to take all the nobles and...
Your Majesty!
It claims that they will begin exacting judgment on all the nobles.
Who can be behind this?
- So he really dropped this?
- Yes, Chun Soo.
- Could the Sword Fraternity have reunited and...?
- No.
That's not possible, Your Highness.
Even if it did, if its Chief was a true follower of your father, he wouldn't do such a thing.
I'll try and find out what's going on.
Why did that horrible thing have to happen when Her Highness was doing something good?
A murder!
Who could have done such a thing?
- My sixth sense is telling me something.
- What's that?
This is the act of lowborn against the nobles.
Like the Sword Fraternity!
- Sword Fraternity?
What's that?
- You ignorant fool!
Come to think of it, you must have been a little kid back then.
Back in the days, some lowborn got together and killed all of these nobles!
But fortunately, they all got caught and were killed.
- Yes, I remember hearing about that!
- One of them was a royal musician.
- Sulhee, you remember, don't you?
- What?
Oh yes... vaguely.
You mean this is their doing?
- But you just said they were all killed!
- Who knows?
Maybe they're crawling back out.
You're making too much of this murder.
No, my instincts are telling me something.
I have goosebumps all over!
It's the same feeling as back then!
What instincts?
I'd rather believe in a dog's instincts!
What?
Are you comparing me to a dog?
Stop hitting me!
I'm no longer a royal musician or your lackey!
I'm the maestro at this gisaeng house!
You're still a government employee!
And once a lackey, you're forever a lackey!
You don't want to see me anymore?
- I wasn't going to say this, but I'm going to get mad!
- Get mad?
How?
You rascal...
You might actually hit someone with that fist!
- Fine, show me what you've got!
- Hot!
You deserved that!
I'm so tired!
Oh, what a fate I have!
How can someone live in a place like this?
Madam, look over there!
That can't be...
Is that my husband and Ho-Yang?
My Lord!
Ho Yang!
- My dear!
- Mother!
My Lord!
Ho Yang!
My goodness, both of you look like beggars!
Mother, this is so delicious!
- My dear, you should have some too.
- I'm all right.
Go ahead and eat up.
Then can I have this last meat patty?
Rascal!
That's mine!
How did you two end up like this?
Don't they feed you in exile?
Don't even talk about it, Mother!
You work all day and all they give you is a bowl of rice and vegetables!
How do the lowborn live like this?
I know!
I think I could murder someone for one meat patty.
Please eat up, my Lords.
By the way, have you heard the news here?
- What news?
- Nobles are being murdered in the capital!
- What?
- Nobles are being murdered?
By who?
No one knows!
I heard the news during the journey here.
But everyone's saying that it must be the lowborn.
Go on and eat up.
Eat this and the apples too.
This is not the work of the Sword Fraternity.
They were all killed years ago.
But there may be survivors.
Just like you.
Even if there were survivors, they couldn't have done this.
It is not the objective of the Sword Fraternity to murder nobles, my Lord!
I want to believe that too.
But this is the Sword Fraternity's insignia, is it not?
What if someone is masterminding this?
What if they are using the Sword Fraternity again to obtain their personal goals like they did many years ago?
First, we should keep this quiet until we have confirmed everything.
- Who is investigating this case?
- The City Prefecture.
Now the most important factor is to see who is going to be in charge.
City Prefecture
My Lord!
Welcome, Governor.
I will only accept such a noisy greeting today.
(Jang Mu-Yeol)
- Let's go in.
- My Lord...
It's not that way.
It's this way, my Lord.
You must be tired from your work as a Secret Inspector.
I have prepared the girls to ease your fatigue.
How dare you think this of him?
- Remove them immediately!
- But sir...!
Enough.
Don't shout.
A man can make mistakes.
But don't do it twice.
Do you understand?
Yes, My Lord!
His name is Jang Mu-Yeol.
He is the eldest son of the late Inspector-General Jang Ik-Hun.
My Lord, Inspector-General Jang Ik-Hun was...!
Yes, you're right.
Jang Ik-Hun was the man you found.
Jang Mu-Yeol is his son.
Welcome!
Your Majesty, I, Governor Jang Mu-Yeol of the City Prefecture, humbly greet you.
Have you been well, Governor?
Yes, Your Majesty.
What?
Jang Mu-Yeol has returned?
Yes, Excellency.
He was brought back as Governor of the City Prefecture.
Why did that position have to go to to the late Inspector-General's son?
I've heard about him too.
A man's true character is not easily known.
But people say that he's a upright and just fellow.
When he was a Secret Inspector, he was equally stringent with his fellow South Faction members.
The South Faction has cast him aside, but His Majesty favors him deeply.
Is that so?
But why do you ask?
It's nothing.
If he's such a man, wouldn't he help us?
Help?
How do you mean, Your Highness?
If he's the son of the late Inspector-General, wouldn't he want to find his father's killer too?
If this is someone is masterminding this, they might be the very people we've been looking for!
This could be an opportunity for us to find them!
My Lord, someone is here to see you.
- My Lord!
- It's been a long time.
How long has it been since we've met?
It was when you left for Jeolla province as a Secret Inspector, so it's been ten years.
I've been hearing about you.
If a man like you has been put in charge of the Royal Guard, government must be doing something right!
You're treading on shaky ground!
What if your fellow South Faction members hear you?
Let them hear!
One can't keep silent for fear of someone hearing!
Actually, I came to ask you something.
Yes, I knew you had something on your mind.
What is it?
Please have a seat.
Are you asking me if I consider this an act by the lowborn against the nobles?
- That's right.
- Are you referring to the Sword Fraternity?
You were in charge of their case many years ago.
I ask because you may consider this to be the same case.
What is your opinion?
If you want my true opinion, then I will say that I will not jump to conclusions.
It's possible that they may have re-formed, but they haven't done anything.
I will not suspect the lowborn people simply because of one murder.
- Sir...
- Did you see him out?
- Yes, sir.
- Get ready.
It's time.
Yes, sir!
- Make sure we weren't followed.
- Yes, sir.
Welcome, sir.
She's waiting for you inside.
This way.
- Your Highness!
- It's been a long time, Inspector.
No, I suppose I should address you as Governor now.
Yes, Your Highness.
You look like you're in shock.
I promised you power to control the South Faction.
That is the secret.
So now everything depends on you.
Their lives now rest in your hands.
Your Excellency, you have a guest.
- At this hour?
- Yes, Excellency.
It's been a long time, Your Excellency.
You...!
What is it that you want?
You haven't even given me time to ask about your health.
You're still cold towards me, Your Excellency.
Why is that?
Is it because of my father?
Wh... what?
What do you mean by that?
I met with Consort Hui before I came here.
She told me that it wasn't the lowborn who killed my father, but that it was you.
Now...
I don't know what she told you, but that's...
Don't worry, Your Excellency.
If I wanted vengeance, would I have come here so calmly?
Please forget about it.
That's what I came here to say.
- What...?
- It happened a long time ago.
What good will it do to bring it up now?
If I were in your shoes, I would have done the same.
That's all.
I want to lend my strength to raising up the South Faction.
I wanted to show you that there is no sword hidden in my hand, Your Excellency.
Sir!
Are you sure you're all right?
He killed your father!
Do you really intend to work with him?
Work with him...?
Does it seem like that's what I'm doing?
I'm going to make Oh Tae-Suk work for me the rest of his life like a dog.
- I have obtained a precious treasure!
- Your Highness!
Do you understand, Lady Cho?
An honest man cannot succeed.
But a man who pretends to be honest can obtain what he wants quickly.
Jang Mu-Yeol knows this.
It's in his bones.
I finally have a dependable and intelligent supporter.
- You're the Third Minister of Justice.
- Who are you?
Who... who are you?
My Lord!
- What?
Another murder last night?
- Yes, my Lord!
Move aside!
My Lord!
- How could this happen?
- He's the Third Minister of Justice, Hong Ju-Ho.
What happened?
It wasn't just him.
A Third Inspector was also murdered at the same time.
- Chun Soo!
- Your Highness!
I heard there was another murder last night.
Two government officials were murdered last night.
Another manifesto was delivered to the city prefecture office claiming more murders in the future.
How dare they try to negotiate with me and the government?
This is outrageous.
If the city prefecture's resources are insufficient, you may use any government guard to find these criminals.
Yes, Your Majesty!
How dare...!
I can see this has troubled you as well, Your Highness.
Both Chief Suh and Officer Cha seemed that way too.
Why are you so worried?
Do you think the Sword Fraternity is involved?
That is...!
I knew who your father was.
So please be honest with me too.
My duty is to help you, Your Highness.
Please allow me to investigate this further.
But I need some time, my Lord.
But you...
If this is truly the work of the Sword Fraternity, I will be able to find out.
My Lord!
So the man who killed the Director was in possession of the Sword Fraternity's insignia?
Yes, but it wasn't the Sword Fraternity.
This is most certainly another conspiracy!
If that's true, that they could be the same people who framed them all those years ago.
Your Highness, the hand signals that late Inspector-General showed you...
- Could you show it to me?
- The hand signals?
Yes, Your Highness.
Do you know what it means?
I tried for many years to find out the meaning, but I couldn't find anything.
It didn't seem to be a code or metaphor.
Perhaps it's Chinese signs for numbers...
What?
The hand signals...
When I was in Uiju, I saw merchants from Qing using those signs.
- Are you certain?
- Yes.
If that's the case, then they are signaling numbers.
But what could it mean?
If these signs mean numbers in Qing, what do they mean?
Eight and five...
Ten and five, Your Highness.
But that confuses me even more.
If those signals are numbers in Chinese, what could they mean?
Eight and five...
Ten and five, Your Highness.
But that confuses me even more.
If those signals are numbers in Chinese, what could they mean?
Eight, five, ten and five...
What could it possibly mean?
Consort Chun, what is this request you want to ask of me?
Your Majesty!
What?
Consort Chun is leaving the Palace?
- She's taking a holiday outside the Palace?
- Yes, Your Highness.
The Queen has arranged a house for her to stay in.
Indeed?

Episode 44
Your Highness.
- Make sure nothing is omitted.
- Yes, sir.
May we begin, Your Highness?
Before we begin, I have something to say.
Release my attendants and the Lady Investigators.
- Find Consort Chun!
Hurry!
- Yes, Your Majesty!
- What?
His Majesty?
- Yes, sir.
- Your Majesty!
- Where is Consort Chun?
- Your Majesty?
- Didn't you hear me?
Where is she?
Your Majesty...!
Why are you here?
Did you forget what I said?
Come with me!
- We will return to the palace.
- Your Majesty!
Why are you still standing there?
I said come with me!
Your Majesty!
I distinctly remember not giving you my permission to investigate Consort Chun!
So move aside, Governor!
Your Majesty...
Forgive me, Your Majesty, but that will not be possible.
Consort Chun has already confessed to everything.
What...?
Her Highness has already confessed her true identity, ...her relationship with the Sword Fraternity, ...as well as her attempt to help the current Chief of the Sword Fraternity.
Your Majesty, the scribes have already recorded everything.
It is now impossible to reverse everything.
Please understand.
Dong Yi...!
You mean to say Consort Chun went to the Prefecture Office?
Yes, Your Majesty.
All of her attendants had been arrested without cause, ...and His Majesty was suffering from harsh criticism.
Her Highness couldn't endure it anymore.
They used her character to their advantage.
They forced her to do this.
What will happen now, Your Majesty?
Even the King will be unable to do anything now!
- Your Majesty...
- Why did you do this?
How could you do this to me?
You confessed?
Don't you know what this is all about?
If you are found guilty, the consequences will be severe!
The ministers will put on the pressure until you draw your last breath!
I know that, Your Majesty.
But there are two things I value more than my own life.
They are the lives of my attendants,
- As well as your...
- Me?
- Don't say you did it for me!
- Your Majesty...!
If that is true...
If you really gave me a single thought...
You wouldn't have done this.
You would have asked me to give up my crown and run away with you!
Now I'm supposed to punish you?
I won't do it!
Do you hear me?
I won't!
Your Majesty...!
Your Majesty...
Don't call me that.
From this moment onwards, I am no longer King!
I'll do whatever it takes!
I'll do anything!
Your Majesty...
Please let me go.
Please don't let me pull you down like this.
Father!
Father!
That means Consort Chun is finished!
She confessed to everything, so you're probably right.
That means she's going to die.
She helped the Sword Fraternity!
The nobles won't let her live!
Goodness, what an unfortunate woman she is!
Is she stupid?
Why would she confess to such a thing?
That's because she's a kind person.
She must have felt guilty because others were suffering.
What, you stupid boy?
If she had come to me, this would never have happened!
Why did she have to become a royal consort anyway?
What do you think His Majesty will do?
Do you think he'll still try to protect her?
Don't be stupid!
How can you think that of the King?
Consort Chun must be executed.
Consort Chun has the Prince.
One day, he will threaten the Crown Prince's claim to the throne.
That's why it's critical for us to get rid of Consort Chun at this opportunity.
Don't worry, Your Highness.
Consort Chun no longer has any place to hide.
Your Majesty, how can an elder of the Inner Court help the nation's enemy, the Sword Fraternity?
How can such an outrageous thing happen?
Your Majesty, Consort Chun's crime is unpardonable!
She must be executed in order to return our nation back to stability!
- Please hear our plea!
- Please hear our plea!
The protests are not only by the South Faction.
Even the West Faction is refusing to support Consort Chun.
What did you say?
Your Majesty, we cannot justify support Consort Chun right now.
I think you should withdraw yourself from this incident too.
Minister, if it weren't for Consort Chun, I would not still be Queen.
So how can you say something like that?
Your Majesty...!
Tell the ministers to come and see me.
I will speak to them myself.
How is the situation?
The ministers are all refusing to report for the Grand Assembly.
The scholars at the Confucian Academy have called for a protest strike.
That's not all, Your Majesty.
Even the minor officials have refused to report to work and have paralyzed the entire government!
Go and make all the Ministers write their letters of resignation.
Give the Confucian scholars a time limit on their strike.
But if they do not obey, expel them all from the academy!
Your Majesty...!
Have the commoner assistants handle the work.
Make sure there are no disruptions to civilian life.
Do you understand me?
Your Majesty, that's...!
They claim this will shake up the stability of our nation?
Yes, that's exactly what I'm going to do!
- Your Majesty...
- I want to be alone.
I will never let them have you, Dong Yi!
Never!
Your Highness...!
I...
I've done a terrible thing to His Majesty.
- Your Highness!
- I've come to see the Prince.
- Has he been difficult lately?
- No, Your Highness.
My baby...
- Don't you think the Prince looks odd?
- Your Highness?
He looks like he's in discomfort.
He acts like around this time.
Probably because he's sleepy.
Is that so?
Yes, Your Highness.
I'll go fetch his wet nurse.
Once he's had his milk, he'll be fine.
- All right.
Go and get her.
- Yes, Your Highness.
This is...!
Is anyone there?
Anyone?
What do you think?
He has measles, Your Highness.
You, fetch the arrowroot tonic...
And you, inform all the physicians to report to the Palace!
Yes, My Lord!
My baby... my baby...!
Physician!
My baby...!
What?
The Prince is showing symptoms of measles?
Yes, Your Majesty.
This cannot be...!
- How is the Prince's condition?
- It doesn't seem to be positive.
Not positive?
Does that mean his life is in danger?
How is he?
Will he improve?
We are doing all we can, Your Highness.
He doesn't seem to be breathing evenly!
- Go and get more mahuang!
- Yes, My Lord!
Mahuang is a potent herb!
Are you sure you can use this on a baby?
We have no choice, Your Highness.
If his fever doesn't go down, there is nothing we can do.
Eupatorium weed!
My father used to give me that when I was young!
But Your Highness, that is a treatment used for the common people.
It's not readily available in the Palace...
I'll go and get it!
What?
- Your Highness!
- Summon all the attendants, Lady Bong!
We need to go obtain something!
Hurry!
Yes, Your Highness!
We're looking for Eupatorium weed.
It has fine hairs and has a purplish color.
- Look for it quickly!
- Yes, Your Highness.
Your Majesty!
My Queen, how is the Prince?
Is he all right?
My Queen...!
It... doesn't look optimistic.
The Physician doesn't think he will survive, Your Majesty.
What?
Your Highness!
I found it!
I have it here!
Your Highness!
Why are you crying, Lady Bong?
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Dong Yi!
Consort Chun...
My baby...
My baby...
Mother is here...
Open your eyes.
Look at me.
Look at me!
My baby...
My baby...
Open your eyes!
Why won't you open your eyes, my baby?
Open your eyes, my baby!
Look at Mother!
Mother is here!
Call the Physician!
Someone call the Physician!
Open your eyes, my baby!
Yes... not even two months old, and he's already trying to talk!
What a clever boy he is!
- Father... say father!
- Father!
Your Highness...!
Your Highness!
Has the closure of the Prince's Palace already been ordered?
Yes, the Minister of Rites gave orders to do so after the Prince's body was sent to the Royal Tomb.
How is Consort Chun?
She hasn't moved from the ancestral shrine.
I was making his birthday robe.
I was going to dress him in it on his first birthday.
I never imagined I would lose him like this.
- Dong Yi...
- Your Majesty...
Please...
Please don't make me do this anymore.
I don't want to lose anyone or anything anymore.
My brother will be sent to exile.
And Gaeduara will surely be executed.
I will lose everyone like this...
Dong Yi...
Your Majesty...
Do you know how special you are to me?
So please don't let me have to witness you suffer anymore because of me.
Can you do this for me?
Dong Yi...
It is a letter of resignation, Your Majesty.
I knew everything about Consort Chun.
But I kept it a secret so that I could protect the Prince.
But now there is no need to do that anymore.
So you wish to resign and ask to be punished?
You must have suffered too.
You will leave me, Chief Suh.
I will not accept your resignation.
- Your Majesty...
- Don't make me do this.
I've lost everything that is valuable to me.
I've lost the Prince, and now I will lose Consort Chun too.
Consort Chun...
Dong Yi said this to me.
She said it was difficult enough losing the Prince.
She asked me not to make her watch me continue to suffer.
Yes, I know I was wrong.
I was selfish.
I couldn't lose her, so I asked her to endure everything at my side.
Your Majesty...
Yes, I have to do this.
I have to endure.
But I'm not sure if I can do it.
I don't know if I can endure not being with her.
What?
His Majesty is going to sentence Consort Chun?
Yes, Your Highness.
Why all of a sudden, Your Highness?
His Majesty was being so stubborn!
Today, in this Grand Hall,
I will give out my sentencing regarding the Sword Fraternity incident.
The Sword Fraternity is guilty of murder in cold-blood.
They mocked the throne and government with these crimes.
Therefore, I sentence the Chief of the Sword Fraternity to death by beheading.
His followers will be banished.
But regarding the Sword Fraternity incident of 1684...
Because their innocence has been proven,
I will erase all record of their crime and recompensate them for their suffering.
However, Officer Cha Chun Soo of the Royal Guard is guilty of hiding his true identity, ...and thus sentenced to exile on an isolated island.
Lastly, as someone who was involved in both cases,
Consort Chun is guilty of hiding her identity and helping the Chief of the Sword Fraternity.
Therefore, her crime is unpardonable.
However, in consideration of the recent loss of the Prince,
Her life will be spared.
Therefore, from this moment on, she will keep only her title and position.
All entitlements will be taken from her.
She will be sent to live outside the Palace never to be sought out by me again.
Sent away from the Palace?
That was the sentence?
Yes, Your Highness.
It is unfortunate she isn't going to die.
But that thorn in our side is no longer to be visible to us!
Some members of the South Faction also felt that execution would be too cruel in light of the Prince's death.
If she had been sentenced to death, the West Faction would protested violently.
But if she's outside the Palace, His Majesty can always bring her back and...
You don't have to worry about that, Your Highness.
This is His Majesty's own sentence.
If he reverses his own sentence,
Consort Chun will once again become a political target.
That means he loses his authority, ... and Consort Chun will once again have to face execution.
Governor Jang is right, Your Highness.
Unless His Majesty plans to return Consort Chun and have her executed,
He cannot call her back.
You mean Consort Chun is leaving the Palace now?
Yes, My Lady.
All preparations have been made for her departure.
My Lady, I feel so bad for Consort Chun!
- Your Highness!
- You...!
Don't tell us to leave.
We're going with you!
Lady Bong!
I'm going with you no matter what you say.
If you're not going to let us, then tell us to hang ourselves!
- Ae-Jong...!
- Your Highness!
Your Highness, the Office of Investigations will escort you.
- Your Highness...!
- Why are you doing this?
- You were tortured because of me!
- We learned this from you.
You did the same thing for us.
Give them your permission, Your Highness.
They're as stubborn as you are.
Your Highness.
Your Highness, you should wait a while.
His Majesty may come here soon.
Yes, I'm sure he'll come and receive your farewell.
His Majesty wouldn't let you leave like this.
I'll say my farewell now.
Your Highness...
Your Majesty...
I cannot believe you have to live in such a humble place!
I cringe just thinking about it!
You're not even the one who bought the place for me.
- Your Highness!
- Don't worry, Lady Bong.
I grew up in a much humbler place that this.
I'm more worried about you.
Your Highness, I've been toughened up by all the work I had to do at the Office of Investigations!
And besides, Ae-Jong isn't a woman!
She's a man!
She's going to hear you!
She hates it when you say that!
You're right!
This place is so tiny I can't even speak my mind!
- Your Highness!
- Goodness!
- Ae-Jong!
- Did... did you hear what I said?
I mean... when I say you're a man...
Why are you opening the doors like that anyway!
- You're such a thug!
- His Majesty is here, Your Highness.
- What...?
- His Majesty is outside.
- Your Highness!
- Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Consort Chun!
Yes, it's really you!
It's really you, Dong Yi.
I came because I have something to say.
- I... have something to tell you.
- Your Majesty!
Your Highness, perhaps he should go in?
Your Majesty!
Please lay down for a while.
I'll send for some honey water.
Let's run away together, Dong Yi.
Let's just be together.
Your Majesty...
Obviously you'd say no.
Because I'm the King.
Because I have to live as the King.
But how am I supposed to live as a man?
How am I supposed to live without you?
Why?
Why did you do this to me?
Why did you make it impossible to see or touch you?
Why are you making my life so miserable like this?
That's why... that's why...
I came here to tell you I'm displeased with you.
I blame you for everything.
And one more thing...
One more thing...
I came to tell you that I miss you.
Your Majesty...!
Your Majesty...!
Have you been suffering, Your Majesty?
So much so that you've lost so much weight?
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.
Please forgive me for doing this to you.
Your Majesty...!
Don't ever bring me here again.
Why won't my cooking skills improve?
- My Lady!
- Stop fooling around!
Will you still be angry if I show you this?
What's that?
Where did you get them?
From the port!
Her Highness hasn't had any fish for months!
Ae-Jong, you're amazing!
- Hand them over!
- You're going to cook them?
- I'll do it!
- Your Highness!
Your Highness!
I told you not to come here!
Just this once.
I don't want this fish to be wasted.
Your Highness?
I didn't want to say anything, but your...
She's right.
I can't eat your cooking anymore!
What?
You would have gotten kicked out if you worked in the Royal Kitchen.
That's my point, Ae-Jong.
So will you give me the fish?
Then just this once, Your Highness.
I want to enjoy this fish too.
Have faith in me!
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
I'm all right.
It's just the smell of the fish...
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
- Are you all right, Your Highness?
Your Highness!
Lady Bong, what is today's date?
The sixth day of August, Your Highness.
But why...?
The sixth day of August...?
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
You must be pregnant!
Your Highness!
- Ae-Jong, I'm right, right?
- I think you are!
Your Majesty...!
Your Highness!
My Lady!
How is she, Ae-Jong?
How is Her Highness?
She's still in labor!
Your Highness!
Your Highness, the baby is almost here!
Please use a little more strength!
Your Highness, you're almost finished!
Please push a little harder!
My Lady!
It's a Prince!
Her Highness has given birth to a Prince!
Thank you!
Congratulations, Your Highness.
He is a Prince.
Did you say it's a boy?
Yes, Your Majesty.
And Her Highness is well too.
He didn't say anything, but gave me this letter for you.
Geum (Chinese Character for Bright)
It's a name.
His Majesty has named him Geum, Chief Suh.
Geum...
- Let's go.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Geum...
My baby...
That is the name your father gave you.
Geum...
Your father wishes for you to become a bright light.
My baby, you must never forget that.
Please grow up to become a bright light for even the lowest of people.
Six years later...
Where is that rascal?
When he gets here, I'll take his long legs and...!
Sir!
Do you want to die?
You're thirty minutes late!
Do you know how crowded the city is?
Everyone's out to watch the Qing Emissary arrive!
Is that your excuse?
I have another excuse.
This is Omija tea from Kyungsang province!
- I had to grab this.
- Omija tea?
This tea brings vitality back into your body and gets rid of cough and...
So this is for me?
No, this is for Her Highness and the Prince!
This is the reason I was late.
You don't know anything.
That rascal...
He's always trying to look good.
Hurry up!
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm coming!
He looks exactly like him!
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Where did he vanish to again?
You haven't found the Prince yet?
He's like Her Highness and good at disappearing!
He's going to drive me crazy!
How can they be so alike?
My Lady, I'm scared.
He's only seven years old now.
How much worse is it going to get?
Her Highness is difficult enough!
We're not going to die of old age.
We're going to die of stress!
- Hurry!
Go and find the Prince!
- Yes, My Lady!
Your Highness!
Come, listen to me!
It's been three years since the Qing Emissary's last visit!
The price to watch this awesome spectacle is a mere five pun!
- How cheap!
- So where is this place?
It's that house with the flag in front!
Please come with me!
- Guys, let's go too!
- All right!
You see that over there?
- Let's go up on that roof.
- All right!
- What?
On the roof?
- Who is this kid?
- Does any one of you know him?
- No.
Who is he?
Who are you?
Me?
I'm...
I'm Geum from the Slave Village.
You are?
But I've never seen you in the Slave Village before.
Do you really live there?
Yes!
I followed you to see the Qing Emissary too.
I'm glad to make your acquaintance.
Whatever.
Just make sure you don't get caught.
- Why does he talk like that?
- I know!
Let's go!
Climb up!
Everyone, be cautious!
Make sure you watch your surroundings, do you hear me?
What's wrong with him?
Looks, there it comes!
- Look over there!
- It's so colorful!
Look at the horses!
You up there!
Come down this instant!
You little rascals!
You little scoundrels!
How dare you interrupt the nobles!
You need to be beaten!
- Come here, you rascal!
- Let go of him!
You appear to be an educated scholar.
But how can your language and actions be so crude?
What?
Recites Confucian verse
One should not belittle others while considering oneself to be precious,
And one should not insult others for their weakness while considering oneself to be great.
You may be a noble,
But how dare you beat a child in such a violent manner?
- Release the child!
- You rascal!
How dare a lowborn child talk to me in this manner!
You deserve a beating to come to your senses!
Men, seize that child!
Halt!
I am a Prince!
Did you not hear me?
I am a Royal Prince!
- Geum!
- Mother!

Episode 34
We're all going to be all right now, Uncle.
Now that the official recognition is here,
The Queen and the South Faction will now be on firm ground!
This was how it was all meant to be.
Now, let's go.
Welcome, Ambassador!
We have been eagerly awaiting your arrival!
Then we should have come earlier.
Please forgive us for coming so late.
Yes, we were on tenterhooks for a while.
But valuable treasures are never easy to attain.
Please come with us.
We have a lavish banquet prepared for you.
Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!
- Brother!
- Your Majesty!
- Brother!
Congratulations, Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
I just heard the news.
The Crown Prince's recognition has arrived!
I have just come from the Grand Palace.
His Majesty acknowledged my efforts!
What did I tell you?
I knew this would happen!
I was worried for nothing!
Look how everything has turned out as we wanted!
Just wait a while longer.
You will soon reclaim your position.
It is not only me.
You have your greatest asset in your hands.
Now that the Crown Prince's standing is unshakeable, so is yours.
Of course!
I am now the Mother of this nation's Crown Prince...
I mean...
the Mother of the future King!
You're right, Your Majesty!
- Where is the Minister?
- I'll go see where he is, My Lady.
Yes, go!
You've come, Your Excellency!
Your Excellency!
Did you find out about the Qing Emissary?
Your Majesty...!
It is good news.
This was something His Majesty wanted.
But this is more about the Queen, and therefore... about you.
Please think about how to give us strength again!
If this happens,
It will become more difficult for you to return to the Palace!
Yes, you're right.
I may never be able to return.
Your Majesty...!
I don't know what to tell you.
All of you have worked so hard for me.
- It is all because I am unworthy.
- Your Majesty...!
How can you say that?
This is all because of our ineffectiveness!
Please forgive us, Your Majesty!
- Minister...!
- But we must not give up now.
The West Faction no longer has any power,
But we are gathering our strength.
We will use all of our remaining strength to ensure that you die as the Queen!
It was our last opportunity to prove Her Majesty's innocence and reveal their guilt!
- My Lady...
- I thought this would be sufficient.
I thought if Lord Shim Woon-Taek came,
We would be able to prove that they even tried to sell the nation's defense for their own benefit!
I won't...
I won't give up so easily.
I won't let the truth disappear like this!
What will you do, My Lady?
What if we show His Majesty the original copy of the Registration Archive and tell him what happened?
If we do that, then he will believe Lady Chun.
But what next?
If this truth is revealed through Lady Chun again,
Then what do you think the South Faction will do?
Do you think they'll admit their guilt so easily?
My Lord...!
We should have revealed that...
Qing's recognition was not being given because of that Registration Archive.
But that recognition has arrived.
So how can we prove their guilt?
It will only bring more suffering to Lady Chun.
My Lord!
You need to come with us!
You can't do this, My Lady!
You're pouring oil into the fire and jumping into it!
Please let me go!
I need to tell His Majesty the truth!
My Lady, you need to consider your own safety!
I traded my safety for the evidence from the Royal Treasury.
And now you want me to consider it again?
- My Lady...!
- Then what about Her Majesty?
We have lost everything that can bring her back!
Lady Chun!
Hand over the book!
My Lord...!
What can you do by giving that to His Majesty now?
Why don't you understand that putting yourself in danger will only bring more worry to His Majesty?
- My Lord...
- Don't you know why you can't do this?
You're now no longer responsible only for yourself!
Many lives depend on the path you take!
You're not the only one who feels this way.
We won't let this happen so easily.
So won't you trust us and let us share your burden, Lady Chun?
My Lord...!
Damn!
I really don't know how this happened!
His Lordship was so certain that we would be able to get them this time!
That is what I was going to say.
What happened?
Didn't you say you gave them the fake book?
So why has Qing sent their official recognition?
- What?
- You're so frustrating!
I mean, you gave them the fake book, so how did this happen?
- Perhaps I made a mistake.
- What?
I do that often.
I can be a bit stupid sometimes.
It's so stuffy here.
I'm going to go get some fresh air.
Go where?
- You're supposed to be careful...
- Don't worry.
I'm not a very important person, so no one will be looking out for me.
Can't you tell?
That's true.
I wonder if the women have gotten prettier.
But first, I need new clothes.
Where can I get a nice new hat?
I'm a character myself, but I raise my two hands up at you!
I don't think either of you would know anyway.
Not know what?
Hey!
Did you just insult us?
That man....!
He's going to drive me crazy!
Should we just let him go?
Let him be.
No one's going to be worried about a man like that.
Whatever!
I can't believe he used a hat to insult us!
He's going to drive me crazy!
Are you certain?
The Crown Prince's official recognition has arrived?
How many times do I have to tell you for you to believe me?
Even His Majesty summoned me to praise my efforts!
Now we can finally breathe easily!
Her Majesty has finally gotten what she wanted!
She deserves it, Mother!
Don't we need to show our appreciation in some way?
I have already made preparations.
You did?
They are important to the Crown Prince's future.
I have made lavish preparations so that they will be completely satisfied, Mother!
- Well done!
Well done!
- Madam!
Madam, someone is looking for the Police Superintendent.
Me?
Bring them in.
- My Lord.
- What is it?
The Qing Emissary has asked to see you urgently.
Indeed?
Looking for me already?
Hee-Jae!
- Greetings!
- Greetings!
The Emissary is waiting for you inside.
Lord Jin!
It's been a long time!
I don't know how to thank you for taking care of the Crown Prince's recognition!
Thank me?
Yes, I'm sure you feel that way.
You insulted me and yet I gave you what you wanted.
Your Excellency, what do you mean?
Insult you...?
How dare you insult me and Great Qing with this fake book!
Lord...
Lord Jin, what do you mean?
Fake book...?
This *Registration Archive you gave me is fake!
*Secret document regarding border defense
Are you telling me that you didn't know it was fake?
Fake?
That cannot be!
Now can you see what it is that you gave me?
Lord Jin, there must have been a misunderstanding!
I'll find out what happened.
As well you should.
If you really didn't know it was fake, that is.
But you should know this.
The reason I helped you get the official recognition was to show you that it can be reversed at any time.
What?
I plan to return to Qing with the original copy.
But if I don't, I will tell your King that you gave me this fake information in exchange for the official recognition.
Lord Jin!
So I advise you to do as I say if you want to avoid that, do you understand?
How could this be...?
How could that Uiju Magistrate let this happen?
- My Lord!
- Go to Uiju and find out what happened!
Yes, My Lord!
Look who we have here!
Aren't you Lord Jang Hee-Jae?
- You...!
- Yes, it's me.
Shim Woon-Taek.
- You wretch!
- What an honor it is to see you here!
How?
How are you here in the capital?
I ran away.
I was scared that I would die if I stayed in Uiju.
- What?
- You didn't know?
I thought it was you.
What are you talking about?
Is something wrong?
You look tense.
How dare you...!
Shim Woon-Taek, how dare you leave your exile premises!
- You will pay for that with your life!
- Will you be the one to make me pay?
What?
But it won't be so easy this time.
I have some powerful supporters this time.
What?
Supporters?
You mean that wench who became Special Court Lady?
What?
You mean Impudent Bean?
How can she even be considered a supporter?
It's His Majesty!
- What?
- I came back under His Majesty's orders.
What?
His Majesty...?
So this man is the one who helped Lady Chun in Uiju?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty...
Chief Suh, I wish to speak to this man alone.
Leave us.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I heard of what you did.
As a man, I am indebted to you.
Please don't say such things, Your Majesty.
But the reason I summoned you isn't about the debt.
I wish to give you a job.
Your Majesty?
Sir!
Sir!
So it's true!
Impudent Bean, you're really....!
Lady Chun, I, Shim Woon-Taek, greet you!
Sir...!
What do I do?
How...?
Did you summon me, My Lord?
- Tell Her Majesty I need to see her!
- Yes, My Lord.
Your Majesty!
It was good that you're here.
I wanted your advice on something.
Don't you think we should do something to silence Lord Jin on what we did?
Oiled leather is softer.
Perhaps we should give him...
Your Majesty!
Please forgive me, but this is not the time to discuss such matters.
What do you mean?
This is not the time...?
We have a problem.
We've been blindsided, Your Majesty!
What?
What did you say?
You met Jang Hee-Jae before you came here?
- Yes, My Lord.
- Sir!
Why did you do such a reckless thing?
To show him I was here.
I wanted to know what he would do knowing that I was here.
What he would do?
I need to know if he knew the book he gave to Qing was fake, ... and that we have the original book.
But fortunately, I don't think he knows that we have it.
And one more thing.
I found out a key piece of information.
Key piece of information?
It seemed like something had gone wrong.
Jang Hee-Jae's face was dark when he came out of Mohwagwan.
I was disappointed I was the only one to see it!
I'm certain there's a problem.
But the official recognition has already arrived.
That's why we need to find out what this new problem is.
We need to know why this problem has Jang Hee-Jae so worried.
The reason why Jang Hee-Jae is troubled is our opportunity.
So this isn't over yet.
We still have means to corner them.
Things don't look good, Your Majesty.
Then where is the real Registration Archive?
We are looking everywhere.
And I promise you we'll find it!
How... how could this have happened?
We almost had it!
You don't think they have it?
No, that's impossible.
If so, why didn't they reveal it before?
I sent someone to Pyongyang to find the original.
We will handle this matter.
First, we need to get rid of Shim Woon-Taek...
No.
That won't fix the problem.
He was summoned by His Majesty.
If you harm him, we can pay the price.
- Take care of Lady Chun.
- What?
Take care of her?
What do you mean?
The Palace moves according to power and authority.
Lady Chun has to live in the midst of that maelstorm.
Before I summoned you, I read through all the petitions you sent.
They were all insolent, but written intelligently and with passion.
Please forgive me, Your Majesty!
Lend your strength to Lady Chun.
I need a man like you in government to support Lady Chun.
So this isn't over yet.
We still have means to corner them.
This was the end goal of my ambitions.
But Dong Yi, it's you again who is keeping it from me.
No...
That will never happen.
I will never go down on my knees because of you!
Lady Cho!
Yes, Your Majesty?
Summon the Councilor and the Assistant Director of the Tribunal.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Drink up!
Isn't the wine amazing?
The wine is satisfactory, but the food isn't very good.
It isn't?
Should we go to another gisaeng house then?
We've been to all the gisaeng houses in the capital already.
It's so warm these days.
I wonder if the breeze from the river would be cool.
Of course!
Being on a boat in the summer is the best!
- Ho-Yang!
Reserve a boat for us.
- Yes, Father!
By the way, if we are to curry favor with Lady Chun,
We should get acquainted with her family.
But it doesn't seem like she has any?
That's because she lost them when she was young!
I feel so sorry for her!
How lonely she must have been!
Really?
How terrible!
Is that why she entered the Bureau of Music?
I don't know anything about that.
You told me that a gisaeng asked you for a favor!
A gisaeng?
Which one?
I bought Dong Yi...
I mean Her Ladyship, as a government slave at Sungchun.
Bought her as a government slave?
Really?
You're really going to injure me one day!
Drink up.
So they didn't find out anything?
Yes, what they said was already on record.
She was a slave at a gisaeng house in Sungchun.
But that gisaeng house is gone and there is no way to confirm it!
Yes, My Lord.
There are no records of her background anywhere!
How could this be?
My Lord, someone from the Palace is here.
My Lord!
So you've found nothing suspicious about her?
But that's why it's so suspicious.
There is no information on her at all!
For the past few months,
All the police bureaus and prefecture offices have been ordered to find all information regarding a slave girl by the name of Dong Yi.
- And yet you found nothing?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
There was nothing whatsoever found on Chun Dong Yi.
That means her information was deliberately removed...
Or that is not her real name.
And the reason for that would great enough to warrant such an action.
Please give us some more time.
We will...
No.
We have no more time.
Dong Yi and I are already in the midst of battle.
The only thing left is who will draw blood first.
Your Majesty...!
Are you certain?
That's what Her Majesty said?
Yes, Uncle.
She's going to do it tomorrow.
She said that is the only way to reveal Lady Chun's secret.
But that's...!
Oh my goodness, what's going on?
Why is the Queen...?
Lord Shim Woon-Taek has to enter Mohwagwan if he is to assess the situation.
Is there a way?
Jung-Im and I will find out.
- My Lady!
I have news...!
- What is it?
I mean, it's not bad news, but...
How do I describe this?
What's wrong?
Are you sure this is Her Majesty's bidding?
Yes, she has ordered you to commence all preparations to carry out this decree.
What did you say?
You want to appoint Lady Chun as a Royal Consort?
That's what I said, Your Majesty.
I gave the decree and it is being carried out.
My Queen...!
The Queen is appointing me as a Royal Consort?
Yes, she has already given the decree!
My Lady!
Why do you appear so surprised, Your Majesty?
Isn't this what you wanted as well?
Did I make an error?
No, you didn't...
But I was just surprised that you would do this...
Then please give me your approval, Your Majesty.
You cherish Lady Chun more than anyone.
And as Queen,
I wish to appoint her as a Royal Consort so that she can be at your side.
My Lady, I can't believe the Queen would do such a thing.
What do you think she is up to?
I know.
She must have something up her sleeve.
What is happening?
Why would the Queen appoint me as a Royal Consort?
Why would she do this?
My Lady!
The Queen is here!
Your Majesty!
I came because I thought you would have questions.
You must have been more surprised than I expected.
I heard you made a personal request to His Majesty.
May I ask why you have done this?
Why?
Do you think I have an ulterior motive?
I was the first person to acknowledge you even when you were just a slave girl.
Just as it was I who made you a Palace Maiden,
It will also be me who appoints you to be a Royal Consort.
So now that you know how I feel, when your appointment comes,
I hope you will serve His Majesty with all your heart.
By the way,
In order for the appointment to go through, there will be a few formalities.
Formalities?
It is nothing to be concerned about.
They will merely look into who your parents are and your family's background.
When the Office of Investigations comes to question you, give them all of your support.
Did you say parents and family?
Yes.
Before you become part of the Royal Family,
Your background before you entered the Palace must be looked into.
Did you say parents and family?
She's definitely hiding something.
Your Majesty...!
She has a secret that cannot be revealed.
It is nothing to be concerned about.
They will merely look into who your parents are and your family's background.
When the Office of Investigations comes to question you, give them all of your support.
Could this be...?
Is this what she wanted?
She's trying to find out who I am?
My Lord!
You're here.
Did you hear the news?
Is it really true?
Dong Yi is going to be appointed as a Royal Consort?
- That's right.
- But why?
Why would the Queen do this?
I was surprised by it too.
She must have a reason.
But I have no idea what they are up to.
The procedures for becoming a Royal Consort, My Lord.
May I know in detail what is done for the procedures?
Why do you want to know?
First, they will look into both her parents and trace their lineage.
Why are you asking me this?
How can this be happening so quickly?
Dong Yi...!
Did you hear, Young Dal?
She's going to be a Royal Consort!
Our Lady Chun is going to become a Royal Consort!
That's why you can never predict destiny!
She used to be a slave girl!
But now she's Her Highness, the Royal Consort!
I never thought of using Dong Yi for my own gain,
But I think that'll have to change!
She's going to be a Royal Consort!
Don't you think she'll give my family something?
Of course!
Truthfully, we had something to do with her getting there!
I wonder how much more the father and son will bow and scrape to us now.
Do you think they'll call us "Older Brother"?
Sir!
There they come!
- Let's go receive our greetings.
- Shall we?
- What is it?
- What do you mean what?
Where shall we go today?
We're tired of boats now.
Perhaps we should head for the countryside...
What are these fellows talking about?
How dare you talk to us!
Just because we had a few drinks with you?
Go and do your work!
- Let's go, Father!
- What a pair of fools!
What's going on?
Why aren't they bowing and scraping?
I'm not sure.
Maybe they haven't heard the news yet.
We better teach them a lesson!
They'll regret it when they find out!
You mean she's being appointed as a Royal Consort just so that her background can be checked?
That's right, Mother!
They want to find her weakness.
The Queen is a terrifying woman!
- What a devious plan!
- And this is all because of our efforts!
Your efforts?
What did you do?
We found out that those fools from the Bureau of Music didn't know anything.
That's right!
But what you just said means that you didn't do anything!
I told you that we found out that they know nothing!
But isn't that the same thing as you not having done anything?
- You...
- What did you do?
What are you saying?
- What nonsense are you two up to?
- I shouldn't have married her!
My Lady!
Chun Soo!
I never imagined this would happen to me!
They are doing this to scare you.
They probably started looking to your background when you entered the Palace.
They were looking for something to use against you.
But they didn't find anything.
Because I removed all records regarding you.
- Chun Soo!
- That's why they're doing this.
So that you'll have no choice but to reveal what we've hidden from them.
Yes, this is definitely a trap, she would have no choice but to walk into it.
She would have no choice but to reveal what she's been hiding.
We will have to write an appointment decree for Lady Chun to become a Royal Consort,
So Eun-Geum and Shibi,
You will look at records from the Bureau of Properties for Lady Chun's background.
Yes, Madam Chief.
Don't worry, Dong Yi.
Everything will be fine.
I've been prepared for this.
I knew that your background will come to light once you became a Royal Consort.
Chun Soo...
I have something prepared, but I didn't expect this to happen so fast.
So will you put your faith in me and wait just a while longer?
I'll take care of everything for you.
Don't worry, Dong Yi.
I'll take care of you.
Chun Soo...
- Sir!
- Is everything ready?
The boat to Sungchan is ready.
We have no time to waste.
We must hurry!
Please come with me.
Make sure that these decrees are taken care of immediately.
Yes, Your Majesty.
What about the banquet tomorrow?
- Proceed as planned.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Here you are.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
I went to her residence as you instructed.
And how is Lady Chun?
You're going to make a hole in the ground with that sigh!
Why are you sighing like that?
Your Majesty!
I enjoy walking like this with you.
Even if we don't talk or do anything.
When you weren't here in the Palace, coming here broke my heart.
I was going to have this pond filled with dirt.
Looking at the water made me think of you.
- Your Majesty...
- Have a seat.
You seem to be troubled about something.
It fills me with fear when you look like that.
Dong Yi, is this about this afternoon?
About the Queen's intention to appoint you as a Royal Consort?
Your Majesty...
I...
The procedures for becoming a Royal Consort, My Lord.
May I know in detail what is done for the procedures?
Why do you want to know?
My Lord!
Your Majesty, did you summon me?
Welcome.
You want me to look into Lady Chun's background?
Pardon me for asking, but why?
I think there is something that she can't tell me.
I didn't want to ask her.
But I feel that I should know.
Your Majesty, you mean...?
Dong Yi told me that a long time ago she lost her father and brother to a wrongful death.
- Her father and brother?
- That's right.
Since she was born a slave,
Perhaps they tried to run away and were caught.
It's obviously a crime for slaves to run away,
But if that is what happened, I can't blame her.
As long as it wasn't a crime of treason, any crime can be forgiven.
That is why I need to know more.
I need to know if my guess is correct.
Since she said it was a wrongful death,
I want to know if it was at the hands of a nobleman.
How did you know about this, Your Majesty?
Did Lady Chun say something to you?
No, it's just a guess, that's all.
Actually, she once went to a cliff to commemorate the death anniversary of her father and brother.
A cliff?
Yes, it is a stone cliff on Mt.
Obong.
Are you familiar with it?
Yes, I know it well.
Dong Yi told me that is where she lost her father.
Did she really say that, Your Majesty?
Did Lady Chun really say that was the place where she lost her father and brother?
That's right.
But why do you ask?
- Are you Lord Shim Woon-Taek?
- You must be Lady Jung.
And this pretty lady must be Palace Maiden Jung Im.
What?
Lady Chun explained everything to me.
Are you certain you will be all right alone?
Of course.
And the items I requested?
Here they are.
These clothes and seal will get you into Mohwagwan.
I see.
But what are your plans?
The Mohwagwan is attended by Lord Jang Hee-Jae's Bureau of Hospitality.
How will you accomplish your task?
- Very secretly.
- What?
What?
That's your plan?
Someone else had the same reaction as you.
Tell Lady Chun I said very secretly.
She'll know what that means.
- My Lord!
- What happened?
He said that Pyongyang doesn't have the original either!
What?
If what we have here is fake, then the original should be in Pyongyang!
It can't be...!
Was Her Majesty right?
That wench Dong Yi couldn't....!
- Excellency!
- Who are you?
I am an interpreter from the Bureau of Hospitality.
- An interpreter?
- Yes, don't you remember me from Uiju?
When you met with Lord Jang Hee-Jae, I interpreted for you.
- Yes, now I remember!
- Yes.
I'm here with a message from Lord Jang.
Is Lord Jin inside?
He is.
Please come inside.
Thank you.
My Lord!
What brings you to the Police Bureau?
I need to look at some records.
The stone cliff...
That's where the Sword Fraternity members were killed.
Yes, that was the place.
You said your name was Chun Dong Yi?
- Yes, sir.
- Was your surname always Chun?
Sir...?
Don't be scared.
I'm just asking to see if you are the one I've been looking for.
I don't know who you are looking for, but it's not me.
I've never seen you before, and my surname is definitely Chun.
They're looking for the Registration Archive?
Yes, My Lady.
They found out their copy was fake, and are demanding the original from Jang Hee-Jae.
The reason he looked so troubled that day was because of this.
Because he doesn't know where the original is.
Yes, My Lady.
This is it.
This Registration Archive is our last chance.
My Lady, it is I.
- What is it?
- The Chief of the Royal Guard is here.
The Chief?
Please go in, My Lord.
- My Lord, I was just about to tell you...
- Will you leave us alone for a while?
- What?
- I need to speak with Lady Chun alone.
Please leave us for a while.
What is it, My Lord?
Didn't you say you wanted to speak to me?
My Lord!
Many years ago, I had a friend.
He was a lowborn, but he was like a teacher to me.
I trusted him like myself.
But by his hand, I lost my father.
This man that I trusted with my own life was the Chief of an illegal organization formed by lowborns.
They assassinated noblemen.
And for a long time afterwards,
I searched high and low for his daughter.
His daughter, who had the same name as you.
- My...
My Lord...!
- Choi Dong Yi.
Is that who you are?
Tell me.
Are you the girl I've been looking for?
Are you that Dong Yi?

But that is all.
Do you really think my brother will implicate me?
Do you really think the South Faction would abandon me?
No, that will never happen.
They must protect me in order to protect themselves.
So if you're here to threaten me,
You better stop now.
We don't need their confessions, Your Majesty.
Not Lord Jang's confession.
Not anyone's confession.
We don't need any of that.
You will confess your own crimes yourself.
What?
Do you remember, Your Majesty?
Many years ago,
I once saved you when you were framed for something you didn't do.
I never imagined that I would think about that now.
The difference is that you were innocent then.
But now you're guilty of the most horrendous crime.
What are you saying?
What are you talking about?
How I prove your guilt will be exactly the same way.
Do you understand?
The way I saved you many years ago, will also be the way I incriminate you.
My Lady!
What happened?
What did you find out?
Something has definitely gone wrong!
The Madam Chief Investigator has been arrested!
What?
What should we do, My Lady?
What if things have gone wrong?
Inform the Councilor of this immediately!
Yes, My Lady.
What did you just say?
Madam Chief Investigator Yu has been arrested?
It's true, My Lord.
They said they had evidence of her trespassing Lady Chun's residence and seized her and her girls!
Evidence?
What evidence!
I'm not sure.
No, that's not possible!
There is no such evidence!
- How is it going?
- We've gathered the clothing.
Indeed?
Is everything else ready too?
Yes, My Lady.
Bring Lady Yu into the interrogation room.
Yes, My Lady.
Things have almost come to a close.
I have come to see His Majesty.
Please inform him that I am here.
All right.
What did you just say?
You have evidence incriminating the Queen?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Is it true?
Is the Queen really involved in all of this?
Please forgive us, Your Majesty.
What is it?
What is this evidence?
What did you mean by that?
How can you incriminate me using the same method you used to save me?
Didn't you hear me?
I asked you a question!
Tell me!
Your Majesty!
We will be increasing security at the Queen's Palace.
Do you understand?
Yes, My Lord!
We will go to the Queen's Palace.
Let's go!
Yes, sir!
Increase security at the Queen's Palace and the residences of the South Faction members!
Yes, sir!
Go to your formations!
- What is all this noise?
- They are the Royal Guard, My Lady.
What...?
Your Majesty, the Royal Guard has surrounded your Palace!
They've surrounded us?
Who has given them this order?
It was... it was His Majesty...
Are you behind this?
Did you use your favor with the King to put me into this trap?
It's all over, Your Majesty.
You can't hide your crimes anymore.
This is your hand, Your Majesty.
Your own hand will incriminate you.
What is this?
You wanted to us to show you evidence.
Do you recognize these items?
These are socks that belong to you and the girls.
This is the proof that you entered Lady Chun's residence!
Do you remember?
Many years ago, you were framed for attempting to kill the Queen.
You were accused of bringing in the poisonous Pinellia.
And I, believing in your innocence, proved them wrong by using vinegar.
It didn't change color!
He didn't touch Pinellia at all!
I'm curious!
How did you prove that I didn't bring in the Pinellia?
This is how.
- And what is this?
- Strong vinegar, Your Highness.
Vinegar?
Yes, Pinellia is so potent that it must be neutralized with ginger.
And ginger turns pink when touched with vinegar.
I applied this method.
Indeed?
If the herbalist had touched the ginger, his fingers would have turned pink.
I see.
That's how it happened.
And although you were innocent then,
I doubt you are innocent now.
This is it, Your Majesty.
I found this in a secret place in her residence.
When you touched the book,
Did you not detect a strong smell of ginger?
- Is the ginger water ready?
- Yes, My Lady.
Here you go, My Lady.
- Search the room carefully!
- Yes, Madam Chief!
Do you understand now?
The proof of your crime is here.
- Show them.
- Yes, My Lady.
Will you continue your denials?
- How can this be!
- Madam Chief...!
We did the same thing to the Registration Archive.
So if you touched the book that was doused with the ginger water, ...your hands will be the proof.
Don't try to scare me!
How dare you threaten me with a book covered with ginger water!
It hasn't been a full day yet.
The ginger water absorbed by your hands won't disappear until three days have passed.
Will you continue to deny it?
Claim that you don't know anything?
- Stop this right now!
- Your Majesty!
No!
You aren't capable!
You can't ruin me!
I am the Queen!
I am the mother of the Crown Prince!
Do you really think you can threaten me with something like this?
Don't fool yourself!
You did all of this to return the deposed Queen!
It will be you and the deposed Queen who will be ruined because of this!
- Your Majesty!
- It'll be you and the deposed Queen!
No, that will never happen, My Queen.
Your Majesty...!
Your Majesty...!
My Lady!
- My Lady, are you all right?
- What happened?
Why is His Majesty here?
He seemed to know everything already.
What...?
Your Majesty!
This is a plot against me!
- I swear I know nothing about this!
- My Queen...
Lady Chun is determined to bring back the deposed Queen!
All of her followers too!
That is why they have made me their target!
You must believe me!
I have fallen into their trap, Your Majesty!
Enough!
Stop this!
Let's stop this, Ok-Jung.
Your Majesty...
Don't make me see you like this.
I cannot bear to see you changed like this.
Your Majesty...!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Is Lady Chun inside?
Yes, she is with Inspector Shim Woon-Taek.
- Inspector Shim?
- Yes, sir.
Why did you tell His Majesty?
- We weren't going to tell him until...
- Everything is already clear.
- There was no more need for delay.
- But, sir...
Perhaps you were afraid, My Lady.
Of the shock this would bring to His Majesty.
That is why you wanted to delay this as much as possible, wasn't it?
I know what you must be feeling.
You might even have felt compassion for the Queen.
Sir...
But it is unavoidable.
For His Majesty too.
And besides, it is His Majesty who will determine the outcome of everything.
Chief Eunuch!
Yes, Your Majesty.
Summon the Chief Secretary and Royal Guard Chief Suh Yong-Gi.
Evidence...?
Did you just say evidence?
Yes, Your Excellency.
Lady Chun has proof of the Queen's involvement.
Everything was a trap.
And that trap has caught the Queen!
Your Excellency, this is not the time to ponder!
You must see the Queen right now!
Wait..!
What about His Majesty?
Does he know about this?
You mean all the South Faction, Your Majesty?
That's right.
I will investigate all the members of the South Faction in government.
And anyone found to be involved in this incident as well as those of the past will not be forgiven!
Do you understand?
I will use this opportunity to get rid of all the ministers who use their positions for power and corruption!
What?
Those were His Majesty's orders?
Yes, he said that he would punish all those involved and reform the government.
Chaos will soon befall the government, Dong Yi.
This is the man, Your Excellency.
- So you're Shim Woon Taek.
- Yes, Your Excellency.
I am Inspector Shim Woon Taek of the Office of the Inspector-General.
Her Majesty is waiting for you.
Come, let's go.
Your Majesty, the Minister will arrive soon.
Did you say the man who helped Lady Chun was Inspector Shim Woon Taek?
Yes, Your Majesty.
He is the son of the previous fourth State Councilor.
Your Majesty, the Minister is here!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
This is the man, Your Majesty.
He is the one who helped Lady Chun, Shim Woon-Taek.
I am honored to meet you, Your Majesty.
I heard about how you helped Lady Chun in Uiju.
You honor me, Your Majesty!
Thank you.
I am glad that you are with Lady Chun.
All I did was help her a little.
But Your Majesty,
There will come a time when all of us need to gather our strength together.
Soon, everything will be restored to its place.
I refer to the place where you need to be, Your Majesty.
- Stop dallying and hurry!
- Yes, sir!
Hurry along!
My Lord, they are here.
They are accomplices to Jang Hee-Jae.
Imprison them and prepare them for torture!
Yes, My Lord!
Take them away!
- Yes, sir!
Come with us!
- Go, you wretches!
- What about the others?
- The guards are bringing them in.
- Hurry up, sir!
- Slow down!
What's the hurry?
We're going to be late!
Come with me!
This is the residence of the Director and Assistant Director of the Bureau of Music!
- Search everything!
- Yes, sir!
Hurry!
Why are you doing this?
What's going on?
Why are you doing this?
Oh no..!
Why are you doing this?
What do I do?
Why are you doing this?
Are we too late?
Do you think they've been arrested already?
- Maybe.
I don't see them.
- That's why I wanted to hurry!
I wanted to see them get arrested!
They couldn't have gotten away.
They're bound to get caught!
Where could they be?
- Sir!
Over there!
- Where?
They're over there!
Father, are you sure we should run?
If we caught, we'll be executed!
Whether we get killed running away or by sentencing, it's the same!
Let's go!
The soldiers are over there too.
Let's go around.
I'm scared, Father!
Oh, there's a dog hole on the other side!
- A dog hole?
- Yes, I use it to leave the house secretly.
We'll be able to escape if we go there!
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Let's hurry!
Are you going somewhere?
You couldn't be running away, could you?
Look, Manager Hwang!
Please turn a blind eye to us!
That's right!
Please help us!
Our lives depend on you!
Musician Bang!
Manager Hwang!
- Is that how you feel?
- Of course!
Everything depends on you!
- Yes, it appears that way.
- You can have that.
No!
They're here, sirs!
The Director and Assistant Director are here!
Oh Tae-Poong!
Oh Ho-Yang!
- There they are!
- Seize them!
You're such heartless people!
Farewell!
Safe journey!
They're criminals!
Punish them severely!
Your Majesty, you must endure this!
You must not be shaken!
Things can get worse.
But you must not be weak!
You must endure it, even if they take me away!
The South Faction will protect you.
They supported you from the beginning.
They put you here!
Why isn't the Councilor here yet?
Are you certain you told him what happened?
Yes, I told him everything.
- Send him another message!
- Yes, My Lady.
The Magistrate and Judge in Uiju who helped Lord Jang Hee-Jae and Lord Oh Yoon as well as the Director and Assistant Director of the Bureau of Music have all been arrested.
That's not all!
Some of the officials at the Tribunal have been summoned to the Royal Guard tomorrow!
So they're going to start from the lower ranks.
That's right, Councilor!
His Majesty plans to change the government.
- He is going to strangle us one by one.
- Councilor!
This is only the beginning.
The sword will soon be at our necks too.
What do we do, Councilor?
If the Queen falls, it'll be the end for all of us!
The Queen is already falling.
There are no longer any roots holding on.
- Councilor!
- Councilor!
Councilor!
Are you certain this is what the Councilor wants?
That's right.
Your Majesty, the Councilor is here.
Send him in!
Why were you so late, Councilor?
The situation doesn't look good.
If we don't do something, all of us will fall into their trap!
Lady Yu from the Office of Investigations will endure everything for our sake.
She will deny my involvement to the end.
- You and the others must prepare...
- Your Majesty...
Prepare?
What can we prepare?
What?
Lord Jang Hee-Jae and the Assistant Director of the Tribunal are both waiting for their executions.
Who can step forward now and risk His Majesty's wrath at this time?
Councilor!
Risking our lives for you is only possible when you are Queen.
You know that is the way with politics.
You're going to abandon me to save yourselves...
That's right.
So I regret that you will have to carry the burden yourself.
The South Faction has to be protected so that we can create another opportunity for you.
Councilor!
But please don't worry.
We won't abandon you forever.
No matter what happens,
You are still the mother of the Crown Prince.
Do you understand, Your Majesty?
This is the political game that we must play now.
Your Excellency, how can you do this?
How can you turn your back on Her Majesty?
Let's go.
No, Councilor, you can't do this!
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency!
How dare you abandon Her Majesty?
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
How could this happen to you...!
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!
Risking our lives for you is only possible when you are Queen.
You know that is the way with politics.
The criminals are here, My Lord.
We did everything under the Queen's orders.
Lady Yu!
What are you saying?
I don't know anything else.
All I did was follow Her Majesty's orders!
I didn't even know that book was the Registration Archive!
- I swear it, My Lord!
- Lady Yu!
Please hear us!
The Queen told us it was our duty as Lady Investigators!
Lady Yu, you wench!
How dare you betray the Queen!
Do you want to die?
Who was it?
Was it the Councilor?
Did he tell you to throw her to the wolves?
- Take Jang Hee-Jae away.
- Yes, My Lord.
Let's go!
- Yes, sir!
- I won't let you get away with this!
I will make you and Chun Dong Yi pay for this a million times over!
- Take him away!
- Yes, sir!
All the prisoners are accusing the Queen?
Yes, Your Majesty.
They confessed that they acted on the Queen's orders.
And that was not all.
A few of them confessed to bringing in poison in order to harm Lady Chun.
What?
Poison to harm Lady Chun?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Fortunately, Lady Chun is unharmed.
Their plot failed.
Your Majesty, all the evidence and confessions point to one person.
There is only thing left, and that is to investigate the Queen.
Dong Yi...
Chun Soo...
Dong Yi...
I don't know...
I knew this would happen.
But it's difficult for me to watch.
I used to want to become like her.
When she was a Royal Consort,
I wanted to have a special dream with me like her.
But look what I have done to her...
Dong Yi, this isn't your fault.
It was the Queen who chose to close her eyes and ears in her quest for power.
She's now paying the price.
Chun Soo...
She won't be able to escape the consequences.
It's the same for you.
This may be what you were meant to do.
Maybe you were meant to stand against those in power to protect that special dream within you.
Chun Soo...
But that may mean being troubled like you are now.
But you have to bury that in your heart.
Just like His Majesty, this is your duty now.
There is only thing left, and that is to investigate the Queen.
Cease your tears.
Your Majesty...
Inform the Grand Palace that I wish to see His Majesty.
Your Majesty, what will you say to him?
Your Majesty!
I gave the orders for everything.
It is as everyone says.
I knew about the Registration Archive.
And it was I who gave the orders for them to find it in Lady Chun's Residence.
Why did you do this?
I asked you why!
Do you really not know why?
Just like everyone else,
I used my power to try to keep my position.
Isn't that what everyone who has power does?
Was that position being Queen important enough to lose yourself?
You used to be so confident.
You wanted to achieve your dreams using legitimate and proper methods.
Yes...
Perhaps I used to be such a person.
But a long time ago, I realized that I was wrong.
Is there a legitimate and proper way to achieve power, Your Majesty?
Those who have it are legitimate.
And those who don't are not.
That is power.
Don't you see that?
Do you know something, Your Majesty?
Even now, I will use all my power and means to try and keep my position.
What do you mean?
What are you saying, Ok-Jung?
- Sir!
- What?
What is it?
Are they...
are they being exiled somewhere?
No, that's not it.
The Queen has confessed everything to His Majesty!
- What?
The Queen?
- That's right!
So what happens now?
What else?
They'll either be executed or exiled.
And the Queen will be sent out of the Palace like the deposed Queen!
- What?
Out of the Palace!
- Isn't that obvious?
She's guilty of high treason!
Do you think His Majesty will let her stay?
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm just so flabbergasted, that's all.
Your Majesty, the Queen of our nation tried to deal with a foreign state for her own benefit.
Furthermore, she framed the deposed Queen for the crimes she committed!
Not only that, the Queen and her brother Jang Hee-Jae, ...repeatedly tried to kill Lady Chun to cover up their crimes.
They must not be forgiven, Your Majesty!
Your Majesty...
Queen Jang must be deposed and sent away to pay for her crimes!
- Please heed our plea, Your Majesty!
- Please heed our plea!
Your Majesty...
I know that the Queen cannot be forgiven.
But I can't seem to come to a decision.
Is it because of the Crown Prince, Your Majesty?
Your Majesty!
Is the Crown Prince inside?
Is something wrong?
- What happened?
- Your Majesty...
The Crown Prince may be young,
But how can he be oblivious to the tension within the Palace?
He was worried that Her Majesty may be sent away from the Palace.
He's been crying for the past few days, and finally collapsed from exhaustion.
It is our fault for not serving His Highness well!
Please have us executed, Your Majesty!
My son...
Do you know something, Your Majesty?
Even now, I will use all my power and means to try and keep my position.
What do you mean?
I'm talking about the Crown Prince, Your Majesty.
I am the mother of the Crown Prince, the future King of our nation.
Will you really pull me down from my position?
Will you really shake the Crown Prince's standing with your own hand?
Your Majesty, I am the Crown Prince's mother!
Don't forget that, Your Majesty!
Let's turn back.
What?
Without seeing His Majesty?
Yes, I think it's better that way.
What can I say to him now?
But he is said to be in conflict about what to do with the Queen.
He can't give his order to depose the Queen because of the Crown Prince.
Will you just watch it happen?
If the Queen maintains her position, ...both the deposed Queen and you will be in danger!
Even so, that cannot compare to the pain His Majesty must be going through.
My Lady...!
This is a decision he has to make.
And no matter what that decision is he will be the one who suffers most.
It may be difficult for His Majesty to make his decision.
What do you mean by that?
Don't you understand that deposing the Queen will put the Crown Prince's status in peril?
His Majesty puts the nation's stability and the Crown Prince's welfare above all else.
He may even decide to turn a blind eye to everything.
Are you there, Chief Eunuch?
Did you summon me, Your Majesty?
Summon the Chief Secretary and prepare for a Grand Assembly tomorrow morning.
Yes, Your Majesty.
- You're here, Councilor!
- Here you are, Your Excellency!
His Majesty has called a Grand Assembly.
Yes, Your Excellency.
He is going to announce his decision regarding the Queen!
My Lady!
- What is happening?
- His Majesty has entered the Grand Hall!
Your Majesty, you are the Crown Prince's mother!
The King won't forget that!
Your Majesty, you must be resolute!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty...!
His Majesty the King!
The reason I have called for an assembly is to declare my decision regarding these past events.
But before that, I will give you a word of caution.
No matter what reason you give me,
The decree and the punishment will remain unchanged.
- Chief Secretary, read out the decree.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
In the year 1694, on the 2nd day of the 4th month,
The criminals insulted the King with their heinous crime of conspiring with foreign states.
Furthermore...
They framed the deposed Queen in order to hide their crimes, ...and used their means to harm Lady Chun Dong Yi.
How can these heinous crimes be forgiven?
Therefore, His Majesty will strip all those involved of their titles and positions.
Uiju Magistrate Nam Hyun Shik and Pyongyang Judge Lee Jung-Woo will be executed.
The Chief Jang Hee-Jae of the Bureau of Hospitality,
Assistant Director of the Tribunal Oh Yoon,
Tribunal Lieutenant Hong Tae-Yoon and 3rd Finance Minister Chung Tae-San will be stripped of their titles, ...and exiled to Hwanghae Island, Heojae Island and Hogil Island respectively.
In addition,
Personnel Minister Yu Jong-Ho, Finance Minister Cho Yong-Shik,
Rites Minister Kim Dae-Sung, Third State Councilor Han Ju-Tae, ...and Councilor Oh Tae-Sung's positions and titles will be stripped from them.
There is one more sentence left.
It is regarding the Queen.
Despite the fact that the Queen's position is to support the King and the nation,
Queen Jang lacked virtue and committed an unforgiveable crime against the throne and the nation.
Queen Jang is no longer worthy of her position.
Therefore, today on the 12th day of the 4th month...
I will remove Queen Jang from her crown, ...and strip her of her title.
My Lady!
What happened, Sanghee?
She's going to be deposed!
His Majesty has ordered her to be stripped of her crown!

Episode 20
Why is he taking so long?
Could something have happened?
Chun Soo?
Is that you, Chun Soo?
- Who are you?
- Get the girl.
Quickly!
Let go!
Let me go!
- Chun Soo!
Chun Soo!
- Gag her and take her away.
Hurry!
Sir...
- Was he telling the truth?
- Yes, sir.
He was.
The Royal Musician he lives with, ... confirmed that he knows Lady Investigator Chun.
- Is that so?
- Yes, they're supposed to be like siblings!
I'll have to listen to the details later.
But why were you there?
We were following the secretary of Im Sang Ju Trade.
What?
You too?
Then you were watching him too?
Yes, we were investigating the money order.
But how did you know that?
- Did you hear about this from Dong Yi?
- Yes, sir.
I told her to stop her investigation.
- But she was following him with you!
- Yes, that's right.
Sir, I have to go to her.
She's waiting for me right now!
- Where is she?
- In front of the Im Sang Ju Trade office.
- We have Dong Yi, sir.
- Indeed?
- Are you sure it's the right girl?
- Yes, I'm sure of it.
There are still pedestrians around, so we've locked her up at the warehouse by the river.
Now I finally have that meddlesome wench in my grasp.
Kill her so that she can't meddle anymore.
But still, she is a Lady Investigator from the Palace.
Yes, sir.
There must be no loose ends.
Do you hear me?
Yes, sir.
Chun Soo!
Where are you?
Help me!
Help me please!
We've sent men for her, so don't worry too much!
- Yes, sir.
- And just now...
You seemed quite skilled.
Almost as good as me.
We should spar sometime.
But how did a corpse-handler learn martial arts?
It just happened that way.
It didn't look that way to me!
Why is she taking so long to get here?
Why are you getting angry at me?
I'm sure she'll be here.
Your Majesty, it is getting late.
Please retire to your bedchambers.
Your Majesty, you haven't slept in days!
I fear for your health!
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.
Your Majesty, it is I!
What is it?
Your Majesty, the Dowager Queen....
The Dowager Queen is said to be in critical condition!
What?
!
Mother?
- Your Majesty!
- What happened?
I just received word too.
The Dowager Queen's condition is said to have suddenly deteriorated.
The Queen was at the Dowager Queen's side.
But Her Majesty's condition suddenly got worse.
What?
Lady Cho!
Mother...!
Mother...
Please open your eyes!
Mother...!
Mother!
What happened?
Didn't you tell me she was improving?
- Please forgive us, Your Majesty!
- Did you treat her properly?
Can your prescriptions be trusted?
Your Majesty, please calm down.
I'm sorry, My Queen.
But I do not wish to see you right now.
Mother...!
Mother...!
Your Majesty...
Mother, it's me.
Please open your eyes and look at me!
You can't just leave like this!
I can't let you leave like this!
Mother...!
Don't leave....!
You were the one who wrote this money order, right?
I'm the trade secretary.
What's so wrong with writing a money order?
It becomes a problem when your trade clan is unable to pay such a big sum of money.
Who is it?
Who made you write this money order that can't even be honored?
What... what do you mean?
Let me give you a word of advice.
You may have written this money order without much thought.
But what you did is high treason.
Do you know that the Dowager Queen is ill?
Someone has plotted to kill her, ... and at the center of the plot is your money order.
So let me ask you again.
Who made you write this money order?
If you tell me the man,
I will try my best to help you be acquitted of your crimes.
I don't know who it is either.
- You don't know?
- It's true!
I really don't know!
All I did was follow my Chief's orders!
It's true!
Please believe me!
You leave me no choice.
You will be accused of conspiring to kill the Dowager Queen.
- Sir...
- Go on.
I really don't know who gave the orders.
But I know of a way we can find out.
How is that?
In exchange for writing this fake money order I received a real one.
That money order wasn't payable by our trade clan.
It's payable by Dosung's largest trade clan, Park Ju Myung Trade.
If you investigate that money order, you should find your man.
- Go with him and find that money order.
- Yes, sir!
- Let's go.
Come with me!
- Yes, sir!
Once we find out who gave him the orders, the rest is easy.
Sir!
I have bad news!
- What is it?
- Lady Investigator Chun... is missing!
What did you just say?
Dong Yi is missing?
We went to the place you told us, but she wasn't there!
She's not at home or the Office of Investigations either!
What should we do?
- Drag her out!
- Yes, sir!
If they've taken Dong Yi, her life is in danger.
Gather the men quickly!
- Yes, sir!
Let's go!
- Yes, sir!
Do you have any ideas on where they could have taken her?
No.
Sir, I need to go somewhere.
What happened to the secretary who was taken to the Police Bureau?
We have an inside man there.
He'll get him out soon.
You...!
Where is Dong Yi?
Dong Yi?
Who are you talking about?
Where is she?
What's wrong?
I don't understand what you're saying?
I'll ask you for the last time.
Where is Dong Yi?
- Tie the rock to her feet!
- Yes, sir!
Drop her into the water so that she'll never be found again!
Yes, sir!
Dong Yi!
Dong Yi!
- Put the bag over head!
- Yes, sir!
Stop!
Throw her in!
Why are you home all of a sudden?
The gisaengs in the capital will be sad!
Oh, Mother.
Shall I live forever amidst the skirts of gisaengs?
On a momentous day like today, I should stay quietly at home.
Is something happening today?
Will the Dowager Queen die tonight?
How wonderful it would be if she did!
Heaven will take care of that old fox.
Tonight, several meddlesome people will go away.
Do you mean the Queen will be deposed and our Consort Hui will become Queen?
Yes, Mother.
Tonight you will become the Mother of the Queen!
Mother of the Queen?
Me...?
- Sir!
Sir..!
- What is it?
I have bad news!
What is it now?
How do you feel?
Are you all right?
Yes, Chun Soo.
I'm sorry I couldn't come earlier.
Don't say that.
You did come.
We have to go somewhere quickly.
Where is he?
- What happened?
- He was already dead when I found him.
Find out quickly what's been done with Dong Yi!
Yes, sir!
Let's go!
- Dong Yi!
- Sir...
You're safe.
Where is the secretary now?
He went with Lieutenant Nam to get evidence.
- Where?
Where did they go?
- What's wrong?
The men who seized me said that their inside man would make sure the secretary got away.
- What?
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.
Officer Lee!
Officer Yu!
What could have happened?
Get up!
Get up, men!
This way, sir!
Sir!
I don't believe it!
They're all dead!
Where's Lieutenant Nam?
Where's the secretary?
They're nowhere to be found!
- Find them quickly!
- Yes, sir!
What happened?
Forgive us, sir, but the Police put up a good fight.
What about the secretary?
Did you manage to kill him?
We...
- I asked you a question!
- We deserve to be killed!
We weren't able to stop the lieutenant from escaping with him!
- What?
- But we managed to wound the secretary.
He's probably dead by now!
You stupid fools!
He's probably dead by now?
I don't need him to be probably dead!
I need to see his corpse before me!
Sir, we found them!
Found them?
Where?
Hey, Lieutenant Nam!
He's still breathing!
- What about the secretary?
- He's dead!
Sir!
- Move Lieutenant Nam.
- Yes, sir.
Let's get him out!
- What?
The secretary is dead?
- That's right.
Lieutenant Nam risked his life to get him out, ... but the secretary's wounds were too severe.
What happens now?
Is there nothing we can do now?
Your Highness, the Chief is here.
My brother?
What brings you here at this hour, Brother?
Your Highness, there's been a slight problem.
Problem?
What is it?
Tell me!
- Dong Yi!
- Where have you been?
- Dong Yi!
- I have to see the Queen first, My Lady.
- The Queen?
- Yes, My Lady.
Please forgive us, Your Majesty.
If he hadn't died, we would have been able to prove the money order was fake.
It's all right.
You did your best and still couldn't find proof.
Perhaps it was never meant to be found.
But it's not over yet, Your Majesty.
Before he died,
The secretary said that he had received a money order as well as a letter.
Out of worry, he left it with someone.
If we find them, we'll be able to find the culprit.
Your Majesty, please wait a little longer.
We won't give up until we prove your innocence!
What... what did you just say?
Do you want to be beheaded?
But that's what the rumors say!
Even so, rumors like those can get you in big trouble!
What rumors?
- It's nothing, My Lord.
- Don't you know me at all?
Don't make me repeat myself!
Tell me!
So...
if the Dowager Queen passes away...
The Queen is going to be deposed and Consort Hui will become Queen...
Please forgive me, My Lord!
I swear I'll never speak such rumors again!
Please forgive me!
What rumors?
That's exactly what is going to happen!
What?
Everyone knows that the Queen will be deposed and Consort Hui will be made Queen!
And I thought you were talking about something interesting!
- That cursed wretch!
He's so rude!
- Sir!
- The Director has asked for you.
- Me...?
Not me, right?
How am I supposed to know what this is?
Did you ask to see me?
- Welcome!
- What is this about?
So... if there is a royal death,
We should be busy at the Bureau of Music too, right?
- A royal death?
- You know, the Dowager Queen!
But she's still alive...
I'm just preparing for the future!
It's my duty as the Director of the Music Bureau!
Yes, My Lord.
But you know, I don't have any experience in such matters.
I don't know how to prepare for anything.
Say something.
That cursed family!
How can father and son be so alike?
How could they talk about a state funeral when Her Majesty is still alive?
Those mongrels!
What are you praying for?
What else?
For the bright future of Consort Hui, of course.
Her future is already at its pinnacle!
You don't have to pray anymore!
What are you talking about?
At its pinnacle?
Her Highness still has more places to go!
How can you say this is the pinnacle?
I mean, how much higher is she aiming for?
Are you saying that you doubt she will become Queen?
What?
How... how can you say that?
Why are you interfering me when I'm praying!
Leave right now!
Please forgive me, Madam!
I've made a big mistake!
My mouth gets me in such trouble!
Please allow me to pray with you!
I'll pray for Consort Hui to become Queen!
I pray to the gods of the north, south, east and west!
Please accept our petition, Your Majesty!
Your Majesty, the Queen is supposed to be the Mother of our nation.
The Queen has committed acts that shame her crown.
Therefore, she must be deposed!
You take things too far, Councilor!
What has the Queen done to deserve such a punishment?
Don't try to turn a blind eye, Minister!
The medical officer has given his confession and now we have evidence of their relationship.
Everything points to the Queen!
How can you say she is innocent?
How can you call yourself the Minister of Justice?
Your Majesty, this is unfair!
This is a set up trying to falsely incriminate the Queen!
You must uncover the truth, Your Majesty!
It's already been uncovered by the Tribunal!
What else do you want?
How can you say that, Councilor!
Enough!
That's enough!
The Queen Mother is unwell!
Why do you make my troubles worse with this petition?
Your Majesty, I regret to inform you that it is exactly why we're here with this petition!
The Dowager Queen is in her condition because of unspeakable criminal act!
Someone in the Palace is responsible of that crime!
You must not delay punishment when the evidence is so clear!
Please accept our petition, Your Majesty!
Mother...!
- My Queen...
- Mother!
Mother, you must recover your health!
You must not leave like this!
Mother!
Your Majesty!
I have terrible news!
What is it?
They are discussing your dethronement at the Grand Palace right now!
The Ministers of the South Faction have submitted a petition to His Majesty advocating your dethronement!
- What?
- What should we do, Your Majesty?
My Queen...
You... you cannot be...!
Mother!
Where is the Royal Physician!
Mother!
Please open your eyes!
Mother!
This is an extremely important matter, so make sure your answers are clear.
Yes, sir.
Do you know the secretary of Im Sang Ju Trade?
I am familiar with him as we are both secretaries.
Do you know who he is close to?
He has no living relatives and didn't seem close to any particular person.
Sir...
Did you find out anything, sir?
It doesn't look good.
That secretary had no family and no close friends either!
Does that mean we won't be able to find the person he asked to keep the money order?
The Police Bureau cannot investigate this officially.
All files have been transferred to the Tribunal.
I can only do so much because...
I am conducting this investigation off the record.
We don't have enough time!
The ministers are already calling for the Queen to be deposed!
What?
And if any of the prisoners at the Tribunal gives a false confession under torture,
There is nothing more we can do.
No, sir.
There's another way.
What?
Someone can stop the Tribunal.
I will meet him and earn some time.
Dong Yi...
Left Police Bureau
- You still haven't found the body?
- No, sir.
You have until the end of the day.
Find his body or bring him back alive!
If you don't do either of this, I will make you into a corpse!
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir!
Sir, someone is here to see you.
What?
That girl?
Yes, she said her name was Chun Dong Yi.
She is here... of her own volition?
What could she want?
- Send her in.
- Yes, sir.
What did you say?
Dong Yi went to see Left Chief Jang?
That's what happened.
Wait.
Sir!
I gave her permission.
- Sir!
- Don't worry.
Jang Hee-Jae may be reckless, but he's not stupid.
He won't do anything to her in broad daylight at the Left Police Bureau.
I sent men to guard her, so let's just wait for her to return.
I'm glad that you're here.
I always thought you were a fearless and impudent girl!
That's why I told Her Highness to get rid of you.
So what did you come here to say to me?
Let's hear what you have to say.
Last night...
I know it was you who tried to have me killed.
So you're here to threaten me?
I'm so scared.
Let's just suppose it was me.
How will you prove it?
Will you tell His Majesty?
He may favor you, but do you really think he will believe you without any proof?
I am the brother of a Royal Noble Consort.
If you do this, you will be guilty of false incrimination against Her Highness.
That won't happen.
Because as you said, I have no proof.
But the other crime you committed last night...
That, I have proof of.
What?
The secretary who wrote the money order for you.
The man you tried to have killed last night.
You're looking for him, aren't you?
He's with me.
- What?
- The secretary is with me.
Wench!
What are you saying?
How dare you try to tempt me with lies!
I'm not lying to you.
You have been searching for his body, but you will never find it.
Because he's still alive.
He was severely wounded, but he recovered after treatment.
I'm telling you he is alive.
That's what I came here to tell you.
You little....!
How dare you try to negotiate with me!
I can kill you right now!
You can't kill me here.
People know that I'm here.
Besides, there are many eyes here.
Insolent wench!
Why?
Why are you telling me this?
Why are you here?
- I will turn him over to you.
- What?
In exchange, stop the Tribunal investigation.
What?
The only thing I want is the Queen's innocence to be revealed.
I will turn him over to you, so please stop the Tribunal investigation.
Do you really think I will believe you?
If you really had the secretary, you would have no reason to negotiate with me.
We have to negotiate with you.
The reason is...
Even if we bring the secretary in,
The matter of the Queen's dethronement cannot be reversed once decided.
I need the investigation to be stopped.
I need to see him first.
- I need to make sure...
- Sir...
I am a Lady Investigator.
I am not so naive as to bring you to him.
This is all I have to say.
It is up to you whether you'll believe me.
You wretched....!
No, it can't be!
How could she have him?
But we managed to wound the secretary.
He was severely wounded, but he recovered after treatment.
I'm telling you that he's still alive.
Chun Dong Yi, you wench!
- Your Highness.
- I am here to see His Majesty.
Your Majesty, Consort Hui seeks your audience.
Tell her to go back.
I do not wish to see anyone today.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I understand.
I'll come back another time.
Yes, Your Highness.
Please don't be troubled, Your Highness.
The Queen's dethronement has already been decided.
But it's not over yet.
Nothing has been done yet.
- Brother!
- Your Highness!
We may have to forget about this matter.
What did you say?
Forget about this?
- Has something gone wrong?
- It's just temporary, Your Highness!
- I'll take care of the Queen next time...
- No!
That won't happen.
Do you know what I had to do?
Do you know what I had to do to make this happen?
Your Highness...!
I had to throw away my pride!
And now you want me to forget about this?
That will never happen!
The Queen must be taken care of now!
He seemed to waver, but I'm not sure if he believed me.
Where did you get that gumption of yours?
I don't know.
No matter what Jang Hee-Jae decides, we still have to do our duty.
I am going to the secretary's previous trade clan to ask some questions.
You stay here with Dong Yi and look for other means here.
Yes, sir.
I will search Im Sang Ju Trade's safe.
Safe?
Yes, a trade clan keeps their money and valuables in a separate safe.
If he didn't have anyone to confide in, he may have put the money order there.
They should have broken by now with all the torture they have gone through.
- Sir!
- What is it?
Someone from the Queen's family is willing to confess!
Indeed?
Once the torture became unbearable, he must have decided to end the suffering.
This is the report on the investigation.
We received a confession regarding the Dowager Queen's tonic.
A servant working for the Queen's family has confessed to delivering money to the medical officer.
He has confessed the plot was to poison the Dowager Queen and then frame Consort Hui for the crime.
- All right.
You may leave.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty...
Summon the Queen.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Do you have anything else to say to me?
Say something, My Queen.
No matter what the circumstances are, I still want to hear what you have to say.
If I say something, will you believe me?
All evidence is pointing towards me.
But will you believe me, Your Majesty?
I'm sorry, My Queen.
There is nothing I can do.
I believe that you didn't know anything about this.
Although I want to believe you,
As long as there is evidence indicating that your family was involved,
I cannot protect you anymore.
It's all right, Your Majesty.
It is enough for me that you asked me for my side of the story.
I am grateful for that.
I only have one request, Your Majesty.
While Mother is still alive, I would like to remain at her side.
Can you give me your permission?
The Royal Physician does not think that she will last much longer.
I know.
Three days...
No, even just tonight will be enough.
Please allow me to remain at her side until the end.
What's going on?
Why are they looking so serious?
- They're commencing the dethronement process.
- What?
Dethronement?
Who?
The Queen?
Of course it's the Queen!
Unbelievable!
How can they do this?
The King really gave those orders?
He hasn't done so officially, ... but they say he's already made up his mind.
My Lady, is this true?
Yes, it's been decided that once the Dowager Queen passes away, the process will begin.
My Lady!
They say she'll most likely pass on tonight.
It won't be long.
You should come out.
We'll be responsible for carrying this out.
But Dong Yi and Chief Suh are still investigating this case!
They can't do this just based on what the Tribunal found!
Where on earth is Dong Yi?
What is she doing?
- You mean it's from Police Chief Suh?
- That's right.
He has ordered me to search your safe.
- But...
- We don't have time!
All right.
Come with me.
Please take a look.
Chun Soo!
Is that the only safe?
There is one more, but the secretary doesn't have access to it.
Still, may we take a look?
What do I do?
Where did I put the key?
- I'm leaving.
Are there any more letters?
- Wait!
- Let's go, Dong Yi.
- One moment, Chun Soo!
You go ahead.
I need to check something.
Dong Yi!
Did you see a boy come from there?
Hey!
Wait a moment.
You're the errand boy from Im Sang Ju Trade, right?
Yes, I am.
Who are you?
I'm a Lady Investigator from the Palace.
I have a question for you.
Will you answer me to your best ability?
Yes, My Lady!
Did the secretary of Im Sang Ju Trade give you any letters to keep for him?
He gave you a letter to deliver, didn't he?
- A letter?
- That's right.
It's over there, Chun Soo.
It's here.
The errand boy was told to deliver the letter to a young gisaeng here.
Here it is.
The secretary sent me these letters and asked me to keep them for him.
This is everything.
This is it, Dong Yi.
Yes, it is.
- My brother still hasn't sent a message?
- No, Your Highness.
Send someone to the house for an update!
Yes, Your Highness!
- Your Highness, it is Yeong-Sun!
- Come in.
How is the Dowager Queen?
Your Highness, it is all over!
- What?
- All over?
She has passed away, Your Highness!
The Dowager Queen is dead!
Your Highness!
- Sir, it's me.
- Enter.
Excellency, our troubles are now over!
The Dowager Queen has just passed away!
- What?
Is that really true?
- Yes, Councilor!
Uncle!
All that's left is the next step.
Now, the Queen will be dethroned!
Yes, everything is happening as it should!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
How...
how can you leave like this?
How could you close your eyes when you must be full of bitterness?
This can't be happening!
Your Majesty!
Mother...
Please forgive your unfilial son.
Please...
Please forgive...
Please forgive me...
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Now we can request for another investigation!
What's going on?
The Royal Guards are...
My Lady, it's Dong Yi!
- Dong Yi!
- My Lady!
What happened to you?
Where have you been?
What's going on, My Lady?
Did something happen at the Palace?
- My Lady!
- The Dowager Queen has passed away.
What?
The Dowager Queen?
And His Majesty has ordered the Queen to be deposed.
Deposed?
No, that's not possible!
That can't happen!
That can't happen, My Lady!

Dong Yi
- Episode 46
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait just a moment!
Wait...
I need to rest a little bit.
Are you all right?
How can a grown man be this weak?
Is it because you're a nobleman?
All this over such a short run... tsk, tsk.
Your Highness the Prince, you are saying the same thing!
Your servant, a Capital-City Magistrate, offers my greetings to Your Highness the Prince.
Your Highness.
Huh?
Who's that?
That's my teacher!
Let's go!
We must hide!
I came to discuss something urgent.
Please come this way.
You are a capital-city magistrate?
Yes, that is correct.
Before, I did not recognize you and showed you great disrespect.
I came to make an apology for that.
Not at all.
People can make mistakes.
Besides, since I was dressed as I was, how could you have known that I was your superior?
Huh?
Yes, yes, Your Highness.
I also did not dream that someone of a higher station than mine existed!
Right.
So do not dwell on it.
Since I am also a man,
I will forgive you.
Since Your Highness the Prince grants me forgiveness like this,
I can only be moved to tears!
But what shall I do?
Class must have begun already.
The door is locked, Your Highness.
Really?
What to do?
If I knock at the door, I'll be scolded for being late.
Then... since things have come this far, how about you give up on studying for today?
What?
Well, it doesn't matter much!
Often, classical scholars, if they do not want to study their texts, secretly scale walls or run away.
Do they?
Of course!
Have you done that too?
I virtually flew over the tops of walls!
Really?
You are more manly than you look!
But if I don't go to school, what will I do?
If I go home,
I'll be scolded again.
What are you so worried about?
You'll be all right staying with me.
With you?
Yes!
Then you are asking me to keep silent about His Highness the Prince?
Yes, that is correct.
You should not be unfamiliar with the government and politics of this country, so you can probably guess why
I am making such a request.
Yes, I know.
Royal offspring with outstanding talent ultimately have a hard time staying alive.
I understand.
Do not be concerned on that point.
Thank you.
Then what will you do from now on about his highness' education, Your Highness?
If you, Teacher, could teach him separately -
No.
That, with my limited knowledge, would be impossible.
Your Highness, right now, in this country, there is only one person who can take His Highness the Prince under his wing to teach him.
Who is that person?
Who is that person, Teacher?
Oon-hak.
By Oon-hak, you mean, perhaps...
Yes.
I mean Kim Goo-suk, nicknamed Oon-hak, Your Highness.
I sent messages to the Chief of Guards and Supervisor Shim, Your Highness.
Really?
We will escort His Highness the Prince, so you should hurry, Your Highness.
Yes, then, please do so.
I will leave it to you.
Yes, Your Highness.
Here you are.
What is this?
Small Scholar.
Earlier, I saw that your books were very worn.
And this is a new book wrap.
I chose the very best one.
Small Scholar...
But... why do you say that?
Do you not like books?
No, that's not it, but
I prefer Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean to Small Scholar.
Sorry?
It was inconvenient to keep taking my mother's books to read.
However, your consideration is commendable.
I will accept this with gratitude.
Yes, Your Highness.
Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean?
The child exaggerates quite a bit!
Forgive me, but he resembles Your Majesty very closely.
What?
Hey!
I think the circus is here!
Do you wish to see the circus?
Let's do that.
Let us go!
Just a little more!
More!
More!
More!
More!
More!
Oh, what a shame!
Oh, dear, what an airhead, losing to such a little man as that!
Humans can never win with just physical strength.
You are right!
Strategy is important!
You are also conversant with wrestling?
How could a man not know wrestling?
I do not only know it!
I am a very good wrestler!
Really?
You're good at scaling walls and at wrestling -- you must be a very strong man!
All right, anyone else?
Does anyone else want to try?
Here, is there nobody else?
You should try.
What, you think I
- I, I mean, does Your Highness mean me?
Yes!
Since you are a capital-city magistrate, you must have outstanding martial skills as well.
Is there no one else who wants to try?
Is there no one else?
But Your Highness, my dignity as a noble -
The previous challenger was also a nobleman.
Ah -
Even so,
I'd like to do something a little higher...
You lack confidence, I see.
No, no!
This kind of thing is very easy.
Really?
Then go out there and try.
Here!
Here, here!
This magistrate will take the challenge.
Your
- Your Majesty!
This cannot be, absolutely not!
Let go of me.
Really... how hard could wrestling be?
But Your Majesty,
Your Majesty!
Come forward now!
Hey!
Fight well!
Fight well!
Be...gin!
Just a bit more, more, more!
Hey!
Are you all right?
Oh, yes, I am fine.
This is nothing!
Go!
More, more...
Your Majesty, please, please stop this now!
Your royal person might be injured!
Let go of me.
I will not let that insolent rascal alone.
Be...gin!
More, more, more, more!
Use your strength!
More strength, more strength!
More, more, more, more!
Gather just a little more strength!
More, more, more, more...
More, more... a little more!
Wow!
Yay!
Yes!
He won!
He won!
Since you sweated, wash yourself here.
Yes, that is a good idea.
Your Majesty, you are really going in?
Even though it is summer, the water in this creek is quite cold!
Hurry up!
Yes, Your Highness!
Just take this!
Oh?
Do you want to fight?
Y-y-your Majesty...
My Lord, if that is the truth...
Right.
If his highness is such a natural prodigy, it is of course something to rejoice over, but it is also frightening.
That is why
I asked the two of you to see me right away.
If the other side finds out that the prince is extraordinary, his safety will be threatened.
Especially because he lives outside the palace.
Your Highness,
I think our first step should be to keep this absolutely secret.
Yes.
And we should also find a teacher who will instruct the prince.
A teacher?
Do you know someone named Kim Goo-sun?
Kim Goo-sun... are you referring to Oon-hak?
Yes, that's right.
It will be possible for "Oon-hak" Kim Goo-sun.
When he was young, he was, like his highness, a child prodigy.
But Oon-hak has never held a government position in his life.
His majesty called upon him many times, but he scorned the government and only took scholars without interest in politics as students.
Would a man like that take in his highness, who is a royal child?
Your Highness, a classmate of mine from Seonggyungwan is a pupil of Mr. Oon-hak.
Through that pupil, I will try to send a message, Your Highness.
Thank you.
But Your Highness, to his majesty -
shouldn't his majesty be aware of the truth?
No, it would be better for him not to be.
Your Highness!
His majesty must have forgotten past events with difficulty.
On his majesty,
I cannot inflict the pain of knowing about the prince's affairs and thereby being forced once again to remember me.
Did you have fun today?
Yes.
Oh...
You might catch a cold like this!
Do you feel ill anywhere?
No.
It's nothing like that.
It's just that because you treated me like this,
I thought of my father the king.
You probably know, but because I was born and raised outside the palace,
I have never beheld my father's royal countenance.
By any chance, have you ever met my father?
Since you are a capital-city magistrate...
Yes, I have met him.
Really?
Did you see him from up close?
How is he?
What kind of person is Father?
I envy you, since you can see Father.
Your Highness, haven't you ever resented his majesty?
Huh?
For abandoning your highness outside the palace like this.
Abandon?
Not at all!
Mother told me that it was all for Mother's and my sakes.
She said that even if no one else in the world knows that,
I should at least be aware of it.
So I do not resent Father.
But still, when Mother gets sad from thinking about Father,
I do feel a little hurt at times.
Mother still misses Father, but Father must have forgotten both Mother and me.
No!
That is not so.
His majesty has probably never forgotten Her Highness the Sukwon or Your Highness the Prince for a single day.
Then, I'll be going now.
Yes, Your Highness.
Safe journey.
Ah, yes... and take this.
What is it?
It is plantain.
You were coughing earlier, too.
While you were changing your clothes,
I pulled some out from the mountain.
Mother always boils plantain for me whenever I get a cold.
Well, then, I'm going now.
What?
Geum didn't go to school?
No.
I looked for him after you left, but he wasn't there.
Then where has the child gone this time?
Well, I...
I'm not sure...
Geum!
Your Highness!
Mother.
Where have you been?
!
You apparently didn't go to school!
Well, you see,
I did go, but... something happened, but...
Oh!
And then I met a capital-city magistrate.
A capital-city magistrate?
Yes.
So I was with him all day.
Let's go inside first.
Yes, Mother.
It was June 11th, 1693 when I sent Dong-yi out of the palace.
And that child was born in 1694.
Your Majesty.
You probably know that I have not forgotten that day for a single moment.
It is time.
The moment I have awaited for a long time -- it is now that moment.
Look, Mother!
So that capital-city magistrate bought you this book and book wrap?
Yes.
And we watched the circus, and he wrestled.
It was so, so much fun!
What -
What did I just see?
That's definitely his majesty the king!
I met a capital-city magistrate.
Of all things, a capital-city magistrate...
Who are you, sir?
Are you, by any chance... a military officer?
Huh?
Yes, I am.
I am a magistrate here in the capital city.
[Ban on marriages]
I hear His Highness the Crown Prince is finally getting married.
Oh, I see!
That's good!
The selection of a Crown Princess Consort?
The queen has managed...
The queen has, in the end, decided to proceed with the selection.
Your Highness, the Crown Prince's condition is still the same.
What if, because of this, it becomes known that his highness cannot father children -
No!
That will never happen.
Are you outside, Lady Jo?
Yes, Your Highness.
I will go to the queen's quarters.
Make preparations.
Yes, Your Highness.
Really?
The Heebin?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Show her in.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Crown Prince!
Welcome, Heebin.
I was actually just meeting with the Crown Prince regarding the selection of his consort.
You, Vice-Minister of Military, sway the will of the government.
I think it is too early for the selection of a Crown Princess Consort!
I understand, if it is her highness' wish, but why are you trying to delay his highness' marriage?
For him to marry and bring forth children as soon as possible would be most beneficial to the stability of the royal family -
Hey!
When you're told to do something, just do it, Vice-Minister.
Don't ask useless questions about everything.
Understand?
Remember my words.
He is always bad at concealing his inner feelings, and this time, they are even more visible than usual.
He is definitely hiding something.
Find out what that is.
Yes, My Lord.
Postpone the marriage?
I don't know, I believe I've already told you that that would be impossible.
I know.
However -
Then why do you make me repeat myself?
Currently, in the royal family, what could be more important than the Crown Prince's marriage?
So how can you, the Crown Prince's mother, ask to postpone such a momentous matter?
The Crown Prince is still young, Your Majesty.
So even if you postpone the marriage a bit more -
The Crown Prince is already past the age for marriage.
Have you forgotten?
A few months ago, I postponed the selection by your request.
I cannot understand why you are doing this.
Tell me.
Is there some other reason that I should do so?
No, there is not.
How could there be, Your Majesty?
Really?
If not, the selection of the consort will proceed as planned.
So understand that, and leave me now, Heebin.
Tell me.
Is there some other reason that I should do so?
The queen can't have realized that something was wrong?
The Crown Prince definitely has some sort of problem.
I must see the nurse who serves Dr. Nam.
Jong-geum, choose a good time to bring her here discreetly without anyone in the palace noticing.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Oh, dear...
He said it was here somewhere.
Hey, over here!
Let me ask a question.
Where is Mr. Oon-hak's house?
That guy?
It's been quite a while since he kicked the bucket.
What?
He kicked the bucket, I said!
That means he croaked!
How can that be?
Not long ago, I -
I think that man has the wrong information.
Please stay here for a minute, Your Highness.
I will go and look into it.
All right.
Let's wait here a little while for the supervisor.
Yes, Mother.
Are you all right?
Geum!
I'm fine.
Here's your hoe.
Huh?
This is a passage from The Doctrine of the Mean.
What...
You know... this passage?
"That which is sincere is the end and beginning of all things, so without sincerity, things do not exist.
Therefore, the noble man places importance on sincerity."
Sincerity is the conclusion and start of all things, so if one is not sincere, one does not have anything;
therefore, the noble cherishes sincerity -- isn't that the meaning?
Teacher.
You, country farmer, are Mr. Oon-hak.
Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean at his age?
Then he is incomparable to me at the same age.
When I was his highness' age,
I was only mumbling Confucius' Analects.
What do you think, Mr. Oon-hak?
Will you take charge of his highness' education?
Oon-hak is dead.
I clearly told you that.
Teacher!
You made a useless trip, Your Highness.
He is definitely a covetable prodigy, but I do not take as pupils those who have ambitions in government.
The child is not in a situation to engage another private teacher.
Could you not reconsider?
No.
Forgive me, but his highness' pitiable situation is also not for me to know about.
I understand.
I apologize for our discourtesy.
Let us leave now, Supervisor.
But Your Highness!
Why did you back down so easily?
Back down?
Don't you know me?
I am still Pungsan!
Sorry?
Liu Bei, to get Zhuge Liang, visited him three times.
Then you mean you will make three attempts?
I am not a formidable person like Liu Bei, Supervisor.
How could a mere three times be enough?
From now on, he will probably be inconvenienced very greatly because of me.
Oh, yes,
I had something to ask you.
Do you happen to know who the current capital-city magistrate is?
Madam!
Madam is here, isn't she?
Yes.
But why -
What?
Your mother went to the Heebin's family home?
Yes.
When I told her that I saw his majesty at the Sukwon's house, she sprinted there right away.
Why?
Ugh, really!
Why else would it be?
To rub salt in the wound, of course.
Oh, that stupid woman...
I wanted to establish relations with Jang Hee-jae over that...
That cheap tongue of hers, that big mouth... oh, no!
Oh, no!
Ugh, really...
What did you just say?
His majesty went where?
Come now!
While I was speaking, where did you go?
The ousted Sukwon's house, I said!
I mean, he even disguised himself, apparently, to meet with His Highness the Prince!
I knew this would happen.
Honestly, how much his majesty must have missed his flesh and blood -
Butler Hwang, are you outside?
Butler Hwang!
Oh, you startled me.
You, leave now.
Now!
Oh... yes, yes, Madam.
His majesty visited the Sukwon again?
And on top of that, that prince?
[Capital City Administration]
So you did not meet with the prince?
No, Your Highness.
Then what about the other magistrate?
Are there not two magistrates in Capital Administration?
I am sorry, but that position is currently empty, Your Highness.
Your Majesty!
This is...
Is this the intention that you have been hiding?
Correct.
That is why
I needed that long period of time.
This is 100 nyang.
As I ordered you, carry it out quietly.
Yes, Madam.
Madam!
How could you not notify Her Highness the Heebin of this...?
Her highness is currently anxious over the Crown Prince's issue.
What good would it do her to know about this at such a time?
So,
I will take care of this quietly from my end.
Who on earth is he?
Who pretended to be a capital-city magistrate to approach this child...?
It couldn't be Chuisun Hall's...?
Is that Lady Bong?
Is someone out there?
Lady Bong?
Isn't anyone out there?
Lady Bong!
Ae-jong!
Geum!
Geum, wake up, Geum!
Geum, wake up, Geum!
Mother?
Geum, open your eyes.
We have to get out of here now, Geum!
Geum!
Geum!
I can't breathe, Mother.
Geum, hold on just a little bit, just a bit!
Hey, what is this?
Ae-jong!
Ae-jong!
Ae-jong, wake up!
Ae-jong!
Fire, fire!
It's fire!
No, you can't, you can't!
Isn't anyone out there?
Lady Bong!
Ae-jong!
Lady Bong!
Geum?
Geum!
Geum!
Geum!
Geum, Geum, wake up, Geum!
You can't pass out, Geum!
Geum!
Geum, open your eyes, Geum!
Geum!
Geum!
Open your eyes!
Your Highness!
Your Highness the Sukwon?
What are you doing?
Quickly escort her highness and His Highness the Prince outside!
Yes, sir!
Geum!
Baby!
Baby!
Geum, Geum!
Geum!
My baby!
Geum!
Geum!
Geum, Geum, are you all right, Geum?
Your Highness, are you all right?
Your Highness...
Geum is unconscious.
Geum is unconscious!
Your Highness the Prince!
Your Highness the Prince!
Your Highness the Prince!
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
What?
A fire at the Sukwon's house?
Yes, Your Majesty!
How can this be?
The prince
- Geum - how is he?
I must see the prince!
Your Highness, your hand is badly burned.
That must be treated first.
Step aside!
I must see the prince, I said!
Your Highness, Your Highness!
Mother!
Your Highness!
Are you all right, Geum?
Are you all right?
Mother!
Do not worry, Your Highness.
He was only a bit startled;
he is uninjured.
Geum!
The Sukwon?
The prince?
Where are they?
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty...
How did Your Majesty...
How...?
It is really... you, Dong-yi.
You are really... in front of me!
Your Majesty!
Your Highness, please retire now to bed.
You have been unable to sleep for days already.
Sleep?
Yes, I'd be happy if I could sleep.
Your Highness...
Your Highness, it is Young-sun!
What could it be at this hour?
Come in.
Your Highness, there is great trouble.
What is it?
His majesty is currently visiting Her Highness the Sukwon.
What?
What do you mean?
His majesty did what?
There was a fire at the Sukwon's house.
And the king's household... the king's household and entourage...
Oh, and, his majesty also, with the Sukwon -
What are you talking about?
Speak more clearly.
His majesty did what?
His majesty visited the Sukwon?
What exactly does that mean?
!
His majesty really - really did so?
His majesty really told you to watch over my house?
Yes, that is correct, Your Highness.
His majesty ordered me to guard Your Highness' and the prince's safety secretly, without anyone seeing.
Therefore, since six years ago, when you left the palace, no matter the time or the place you and the prince went, we have been guarding both of you from close by.
The fire was due entirely to my negligence.
If I had been even a little more late, there could have been disaster.
I deserve to die for my wrongdoing toward Your Highness.
I beg you to forgive me.
I ended up giving you such a wound.
I caused you... caused you to be injured.
I wanted to protect you no matter what happened...
I wanted to never, ever have you or the prince harmed.
How...
How did this happen, Your Majesty?
Why did you assign soldiers -
Did you think
I'd be able to let you go - did you really think I could do so?
Were you able to let me go?
Not for a single moment have I been without you.
I talked to you and laughed with you --
and so, together with you,
I watched the prince grow up.
With my heart,
I did so every day.
It will not be that way now.
I will look at you with my eyes and embrace the prince with my hands.
Your Majesty.
Come back to the palace, Dong-yi.
To the place where you should be with the prince -- the place where you should live, I mean.
Your Majesty, what do you mean by that?
Come back to the palace?
I cannot do that.
Why are you trying to, by your own hand, withdraw your royal order?
Do you not know what will happen then?
Do you know why... why I was able to endure these long years?
It was because I could take it back.
Because once six years had passed,
I could reclaim you, and reclaim my child.
Your Majesty...
Have the Royal Secretary come in right away!
Yes, Your Majesty.
My Lord, have you heard?
Is it really true that his majesty visited the Sukwon last night?
Yes.
How on earth could this have happened?
His majesty invalidating his own order and visiting the Sukwon?
!
How could this have happened?
Your Highness!
Brother.
Do not be too worried, Your Highness.
All his majesty has done is give us an excuse to have the Sukwon killed.
What you fear will absolutely not happen.
Find out quickly what happened.
Quickly!
Yes, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, if Her Highness the Sukwon comes to harm because -
No.
His majesty would not have done anything so reckless.
If he did so, he must have had some intention.
Your Majesty,
I heard that something truly disgraceful occurred last night.
Your Majesty -
Wait.
Before that,
I have something to say to all of you first.
It is nothing tremendous.
All I have to do is hand down a written order, but since you happen to be gathered in the Assembly Hall, speaking the order in front of all of you will also work.
You perhaps already know this, but the prince who lives outside the palace turned seven this year.
And as you probably know, once that age, he must enter the Royal School for his education.
Therefore, I, in accordance with the laws of the royal family, will bring the prince and his mother, the Sukwon, into the palace so that the prince will receive education befitting a royal offspring.
Your Majesty!
Bring the prince and the Sukwon into the palace?
This is -
I was not yet finished speaking, Left Prime Minister!
Do you know what this is?
Last night, someone, set a fire in order to murder the Sukwon and the prince, and barred their doors.
With this very thing!
So now,
I will ask all of you.
I never said that I would have the Sukwon executed.
Nor have I ever said that
I would not permit royal education for the prince, a royal child.
Despite that, the lives of the prince, the king's flesh and blood, and his mother, the Sukwon, their safety is being threatened!
Even so, the Sukwon and the prince cannot be brought here?
Fine.
Then how about this?
As you wish, I will leave the Sukwon and the prince outside the palace.
Then, the next time even a hair on their heads is harmed, shall I ask you to take responsibility for it by paying with your lives?
Madam!
Have you heard?
Her Highness the Sukwon - her highness is coming back!
Yes, the written order was just delivered.
I think his majesty was waiting for the right time, Madam -- the right time to call upon her highness once again.
That's right.
I knew he would ultimately want her back.
I didn't realize that, and thought his majesty had really completely abandoned her highness.
Hey, consider his majesty's character.
How could he have done that?
What?
You, Eun-geum, kept complaining that he was too cruel, too!
I -
Madam, that's...
I just said that stuff as it came out.
I didn't mean it.
Really?
Your Majesty!
See, what did I tell you?
Didn't I say that his majesty would someday call the Sukwon back?
To the Chief of Guards, too, he kept silent about it all those years.
The Chief of Guards only found out his majesty's intentions a little while ago.
However, never will
Chuisun Hall and the Southern Party back down easily.
So this time, the Western Party must make sure to support the Sukwon.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Of course we will.
I can't wait to see the Sukwon.
Already, at heart,
I feel so anxious!
Madam!
You see, his majesty was not a scary, cruel person!
Not true, Musician Bang!
Since he endured and waited for such a long time, he is indeed a scary person!
Well, anyway,
I don't care if he is scary, scary, and scary again!
Even if he is scarier than the king of the underworld, I'm happy!
This is all due to you, Madam, and you, My Lady.
This was possible because you two protected her highness to the end!
Well, I mean, what did we do, really?
Come on!
We can't say we didn't do anything, Madam!
Is that so?
Yes, that's true, that's true!
So, in recognition, both of you, receive my great bow!
Why are you suddenly bowing down...?
What do you mean, Your Highness?
You are afraid to return to the palace?
Is it because of His Highness the Prince?
Your Highness.
What the prince... what the child will have to endure when he returns to the palace -- that is what I fear.
You are also aware, My Lord, what kind of child he -
So you plan to avoid it?
Do you think it can be avoided?
Even if you stay outside the palace, you cannot keep the prince hidden away.
Someday, the other side will become aware of his highness' remarkable ability, and when they do, his highness will fall into greater danger.
I know.
I know that, too, My Lord.
That is why I am afraid that this is the prince's fate
and the path that he must follow... all of those things that he will encounter from now on.
Mother!
Is it true, Mother?
Has Father really summoned you, Mother?
Has he really summoned me to the palace?
Geum.
Lady Bong said so, that I will soon go to the palace, that Father summoned me and you, Mother.
Are you that happy?
Are you that happy about going to the palace?
Of course, Mother!
Aren't you happy, Mother?
I'm so happy that I'm about to fly away!
Last night,
I had a dream.
Father came and stroked my hair and held my hand, too.
When I woke up the thought that it was all a dream the tears came down... they did... they did... but now, I'll really be able to meet Father!
This cannot happen!
His majesty is being unreasonable!
However, we have no pretext for preventing the prince from entering the Royal School.
In addition, because of last night's incident, his majesty acquired another justification.
So why did it have to happen now, of all times?
Why did the Crown Prince have to -
Brother!
Brother.
Circulate a notice to all high-ranking officials of the Southern Party.
His majesty told them to stake their lives?
I also told them to stake their lives -- tell them that.
Do you understand?
Yes, Your Highness.
So you plan to avoid it?
Do you think it can be avoided?
Older Brother!
All right, Geum.
Let's go.
To the palace where Father is... let's return.
Mother will protect you.
Every wind, every hardship --
I will stand in front of you and shield you from everything.
Trust in Mother, my baby.
I will never lose you.
If it is to protect you, if it is to save you,
from now on, I, your Mother, will do anything.
I am overwhelmed thinking of the past!
Your Highness the Sukwon.
Your Highness the Prince.
Mother!

Episode 57
I'm going to ask you a very important question, Dong Yi.
Not as a King, but as a son's father, ...to you, his mother.
What is your true desire, Dong Yi?
Don't you think that Prince Yeon Ing must become King?
Is that not the only way he can survive in the Palace?
The only person who can take over the throne after you is the Crown Prince.
This must happen, no matter what.
However...
However the only way to save Prince Yeon Ing is...
He must also...
He must also become King.
Yes, Your Majesty.
As his mother, that is the conclusion I have come to.
You want both the Crown Prince and Prince Yeon Ing to become King, ...in order to keep them both alive?
Yes, I'm not surprised.
In the Palace, where if one doesn't kill, one is killed,
To think that way...
Only you can dream of this.
Your Majesty...
Your Majesty.
I wish to be alone for a while.
Leave me.
In the Palace, where if one doesn't kill, one is killed,
To think that way...
Only you can dream of this.
Your Majesty...
The only person who can take over the throne after you is the Crown Prince.
But Prince Yeon Ing must also become King, Your Majesty.
But there cannot be two, Dong Yi.
There cannot be two Princes who can ascend to the throne.
We've come to pay our respects to Her Majesty.
Please go in, Your Highness.
It's so nerve-wrecking every morning.
I know.
I'm so terrified every morning.
What if that vixen bullies His Highness?
I, Prince Yeon Ing, pay my respects to you, Your Majesty.
Have you slept well, Your Majesty?
Have you slept well, Your Majesty?
- Let's go.
- Yes, Your Highness.
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.
I should have done more to get the Prince out of the Palace.
But I never Consort Sook would have such a ingenious plan up her sleeve.
Ingenious plan?
Yes, so it was.
A house with royal energy...
She used the people's opinion against us.
- But no need to worry, Your Majesty.
- Third War Minister...
Did you feel that Consort Sook's actions were a little strange?
Strange, Your Majesty?
What was strange?
I expected Consort Sook to pursue a powerful family for the marriage.
But a mere licentiate?
I don't understand it.
Your Majesty, that was because she planned to use Suh Jong-Jae's house as...
No, if she had planned to use that,
She would have encouraged the Prince to move out.
The people would have considered the Prince as a future King...
Don't you agree?
That's why I don't understand.
An intelligent woman like Consort Sook would have known that.
Why would she have missed that opportunity if she truly coveted after the Crown Prince's position?
Your Majesty, that is why we think she is manipulative.
She is unpredictable.
My Lord!
My Lord, His Majesty sent an order.
He's going to cancel the Royal Guard inspection.
- What?
- Here, My Lord.
We've been preparing for this inspection for months.
What's happening?
- He's postponed the assembly?
- That's not all.
He's cancelled the annual inspection of the Royal Guard and several other events.
Why?
Perhaps he is unwell?
Second Inspector Shim has gone to the Royal Pharmacy to inquire about His Majesty's health.
- Sir...
- Inspector Cha, did you hear the news?
His Majesty cancelled all of his appointments all of a sudden.
I'm trying to find out if he is unwell.
If he collapses at a time like this, it will...
My Lord, His Majesty isn't unwell.
What?
There must be another reason he has cancelled all of his appointments.
What could that reason be?
You mean you said that to His Majesty?
Yes, I did.
But that was a dangerous thing to do, Your Highness!
He may know your character, but should he misunderstand...
I know.
I know how my words may be sounded.
But I couldn't lie to His Majesty.
Because I know just how dangerous my intentions are.
My Lord, what do you think?
It may be considered treason against the Crown Prince.
No, His Majesty knows Consort Sook's character better than anyone.
He wouldn't think that way.
Besides, His Majesty knows better than anyone that the Prince has to become King in order to survive.
Then what could His Majesty be thinking now?
- A decision.
- My Lord?
He has to make a decision as the King.
- He called it a dream?
- Yes, that's what His Majesty said.
He said it was a dream only I could come up with.
What do you think that meant, Chun Soo?
I've known His Majesty for a long time, but I have no idea what his intentions are.
I know how foolish it is to want to protect both the Crown Prince and Prince Yeon Ing.
I know how difficult it will be to accomplish.
But I will never give up.
Your Highness...
That is why I am afraid.
I'm afraid of what His Majesty is thinking and what he will decide.
Cancelled all of his appointments?
That has never happened before.
Why do you think he has done this?
It is probably because of the Crown Prince and Prince Yeon Ing.
His Majesty has been watching everything silently until now.
A heavy downpour always occurs after a stifling and windless day.
- You mean...?
- Yes, he is going to come to a decision.
He doesn't want any visitors today either?
Yes, he has ordered that no one be let in.
What is His Majesty going to do?
- My Lord!
- The entire Palace is tense.
Something big is going to happen soon.
- How is the plan going?
- Everything is ready.
We must hurry.
We have to be prepared for the unexpected.
Yes, My Lord.
His Majesty has completed his self-exile?
Yes, he just left the Grand Palace.
But Your Highness...
- Something seems a little strange.
- Strange?
The first place His Majesty went to was the Queen's Palace.
Really?
The Queen's Palace?
I am going to tell you something very important, My Queen.
Don't you think it's strange that His Majesty would visit the Queen first?
I don't understand why that's so strange?
Foolish girl!
That's because he chose this moment to go there.
Why did he go to the Queen after he spent such a long time in deliberation?
Don't you agree, My Lady?
Yes, I find that odd too.
Normally, he would have spoken to Consort Sook first.
Your Majesty, will you go to Consort Sook now?
No.
I won't go to Consort Sook.
Let's go.
There is much I must do.
- Your Majesty...
- Why did he decide this so suddenly?
Is it possible that Consort Sook is...?
Why has he summoned all of us for an assembly?
What is this decision he has come to?
- Father.
- Welcome.
Let's go inside.
Me too?
That's right.
- Let's go to Consort Sook.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
The reason I have summoned all of you and the Crown Prince here is to announce the decision that I have come to.
Crown Prince, you will write my words in your heart.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
Let's go in.
His Majesty has a message for you.
Your Highness, what did she just say?
She has a message from His Majesty for you?
After Prince Yeon Ing entered the Palace,
I know exactly what rumors have been spread.
In addition,
I am aware of the fight amidst you ministers because of those rumors.
But from this moment onwards...
I will no longer allow any rumors or debate about my heir.
My only heir and next King who will ascend to the throne is the Crown Prince.
Do you all understand?
That is my will.
I will not allow or forgive any political fights regarding the Crown Prince.
Therefore, in order to make sure the Crown Prince does not lack in any experience regarding ruling the nation,
I will include him in all assemblies.
All matters regarding the Ministry of Rites and the Ministry of Industry shall be referred to him first.
He shall be the one to make suggestions to me.
- But Your Majesty, that is too early...
- I am not finished, Justice Minister!
And one more thing...
There is something I need to reveal to everyone.
It regards Consort Sook.
- Is that really His Majesty's will?
- Yes, that's right.
He came to me to ask my opinion.
I gave my approval.
Therefore, you will live outside the Palace from now.
Pardon me, Your Majesty.
Did you just say you're going to send Consort Sook out of the Palace?
That's right.
But why, Your Majesty?
Consort Sook will know the reason why, Second Inspector.
And I think you know the reason too.
This is what I wanted to tell all of you today.
Consort Sook will now reside in Yihyun Palace, away from here.
The Ministry of Industry shall commence preparations of Yihyun Palace.
Once that is completed,
The Ministry of Rites shall prepare for her departure.
Your Highness!
What is this sudden news?
Why are you being sent away from the Palace?
There must be a misunderstanding!
His Majesty would never do such a thing.
Ae-Jong, go and find out what happened!
Yes, My Lady.
Your Highness, there must be a mistake.
The Queen must be lying to you.
It must be a lie!
His Majesty has announced his decision to protect the Crown Prince.
He has decided to send Consort Sook away and set upright the Crown Prince.
What... what happened?
What...?
What is this I hear?
Where... where is our Highness going?
Yihyun Palace!
They're sending her away from the Palace!
Who?
Which insane fool is trying to send her away?
It's the Queen!
It was the Queen, right?
No, it wasn't.
It was His Majesty!
His Majesty?
Why?
He has gone mad!
He's lost his mind!
- My Lady.
- Sir!
It's a decree to send Consort Sook to Yihyun Palace.
What's happening?
So it's reached the Office of Investigations already.
His Majesty must really be determined.
You mean this is what His Majesty wants?
Yes, that's right.
Father, why have you made this decision?
Is it because of the terrible rumors in the Palace?
Yes, that's right.
But Father, that is not Consort Sook's will.
I know that fact.
At one time, I resented Consort Sook and Prince Yeon Ing too.
But that was because of my own insecurity.
I was insecure and used my anger against myself to blame Consort Sook and Prince Yeon Ing.
My son...
But Consort Sook even forgave my mother.
She even took care of me even though I was her enemy's son.
Consort Sook protected and cherished me the most out of anyone in the Palace.
So please rescind your order, Father!
Please do not send her away because of me!
I am thankful that you feel that way, my son.
- That is good to hear.
- Father...
But now that I know how you feel, the more I will not change my mind.
- Father...
- This order will never be rescinded.
We cannot accept the order, Your Highness.
We will not carry out an order that doesn't make sense.
The Office of Investigations will protest this...
- No!
Don't do that.
- Your Highness!
Please help me so that this doesn't get any bigger.
What is the reason, Your Highness?
Why is this happening to you?
- His Majesty must have a reason.
- Your Highness!
Follow your orders.
That is your duty.
- Hurry, Father!
- What is it?
Look at that!
My Lord, Ho-Yang was telling us the truth.
Yes, he must have been.
How can you have so little faith in your son?
His Majesty really made an announcement to send Consort Sook away from the Palace.
It's not that we don't have faith in you.
But he used to cherish her so much, so why?
That's why I'm so frustrated!
His Majesty took her away right when we were going to be together.
Now he discards her like an old shoe!
Can he really do that, even if he's King?
Are you crazy?
Do you have a death wish?
Mother, Father, don't try to stop me.
This time, I'm going to bring her home and make her happy ever after!
- Hey!
- You crazy fool!
My dear, we better get him married off before he does something really stupid!
But he doesn't want anyone else!
Put a leash on him if you have to!
Didn't you see his crazy eyes?
We're all going to lose our lives!
They'll execute our entire family!
He can never get his way!
Ho-Yang!
He'll be the death of us for sure!
How is it going?
The Justice Minister and Third Rites Minister tried to send a petition for appeal, ...but he sent them back.
But that's not the problem, My Lord.
What do you mean?
There are rumors circulating that anyone close to Consort Sook will be dismissed.
It's clear that His Majesty misunderstood Consort Sook.
He's punishing her for what she told him.
No, that's not it.
This cannot be what His Majesty wants.
My Lord, how can you say that when this is the situation we are facing?
Carry it out as written.
Your Majesty, is this really what you wish?
It is.
Your Majesty, may I ask the reason why you have decided this so suddenly?
For now, just follow my orders, Chief Secretary.
But ensure that you keep everything secret.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
What was Consort Sook's reaction?
She has ordered the Office of Investigations to cease their protest and carry out their orders.
And I heard that she hasn't left her chambers all day.
Why haven't you paid His Majesty a visit?
Shouldn't you know the reason why he has given this order?
His Majesty is telling me to wait, Chun Soo.
Don't you understand?
Telling the Queen to give me the message was his way of telling me to wait.
My duty now is to do as he wishes and accept his orders.
This was definitely unexpected for them too.
I never expected His Majesty to turn his back on them.
He used to cherish Consort Sook.
- Yes, that is why I find it strange.
- My Lord?
If no one understands his motives,
Then there must certainly be one that's hidden.
Please make another request!
I must speak to His Majesty!
Please forgive me, but His Majesty has given orders to let no one in.
- Where is His Majesty?
- Sir...!
Your Majesty, I am Inspector Cha Chun-Soo!
Your Majesty, I need to speak to you!
Please, if you continue, I have to call the guards.
Your Majesty!
- Send... send for the guards...!
- Your Majesty!
Leave us!
Your Majesty.
- No, Your Highness, you can't go!
- Lady Bong.
Why are you so selfless?
Why are you going to the East Palace now?
You're being sent away from the Palace without reason.
Why are you concerned about the Crown Prince?
Move aside, Lady Bong.
Do you really think you can bend my will?
Your Highness!
- Is His Royal Highness in?
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Announce my arrival.
- Consort Sook.
- Your Majesty.
- What are you doing here?
What is that?
Porridge for the Crown Prince, Your Majesty.
What?
- Why are you doing this?
- Your Majesty, that is...
What is the meaning of this!
How can Consort Sook be allowed to send food to the Crown Prince?
Don't you know how important the Crown Prince's food is?
This puts the Crown Prince's health at risk!
- Your Majesty...
- Silence.
How dare you touch the Crown Prince's food!
Send that back this instant!
Your Majesty!
Please don't do this, Your Majesty.
Crown Prince...!
Please do not speak that way to Consort Sook.
Consort Sook is someone that I trust more than anyone else, Your Majesty.
What?
Please understand her sincerity, Your Majesty.
- Crown Prince!
- Your Highness...
Your Majesty...
It's been a while since we walked together.
- How did it go?
- Your instincts were right, My Lord.
The Chief Secretary received a royal decree,
But no one knows what that decree is.
- My Lord!
- Find out, no matter what it takes.
Find out what the decree was and who it went to!
This is it.
This is where you'll live outside the Palace.
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Yes, I do.
But it seems too big for me.
You answer as if nothing is wrong.
You act like nothing is out of the ordinary...
When I've just issued a decree to send you away from the Palace.
Why won't you ask me, Dong Yi?
Why are you waiting for so long?
Because I am afraid.
Because I am afraid of what you will say.
Dong Yi...
I've been waiting for you to speak to me.
But when I saw you at my residence and saw your eyes,
I realized that you were going to say something much more terrifying that I expected.
But I didn't know what that was.
That is why I am so afraid, Your Majesty.
Do you remember?
When I sent you out of the Palace all those years ago?
I asked you then to run away together.
Yes, I was sincere back then.
I thought I would be happy as long as I was with you.
I thought I could give up everything as long as I was with you.
And after all these years, I still feel the same way.
To me, this is who you are.
Your Majesty...
This is where you're going to live.
But you won't be alone, Dong Yi.
I'm going to live here with you.
Your Majesty, what do you mean?
You're going to live here?
Your Majesty!
Inspector Cha, what did you say?
His Majesty is going to what?
Inspector Cha!
Your Majesty, please tell me!
What... what did you mean by what you said?
You said that both the Crown Prince and Prince Yeon Ing have to become King.
You said that is the only way both of them will live.
Do you know that was the first thing you ever wanted that was not selfless?
And that was also my secret dream as well.
Your Majesty...
Prince Yeon Ing will surely be a great King.
So if only he could be the Crown Prince's heir...
I used to think that and hope it could be possible.
But there can be only one heir to the throne.
That is the only way royal authority will reign and the government controlled.
Do you understand?
As long as I am King,
The two Princes cannot ascend to the throne.
Your Majesty, you can't be saying...!
Yes.
I am going to abdicate the throne to the Crown Prince.
If I abdicate and make the Crown Prince King,
Then Prince Yeon Ing can become Heir Successor and be next in line for the throne.
But Your Majesty...
Abdicate?
How can you consider that?
How can you...?
Your Majesty!
- My Lord...
- Abdicate?
How is this...?
That was what His Majesty is determined to do.
He had already made preparations for everything.
Chief Suh, Second Inspector Shim and you will all have to take a lower position for a short time.
But this is only in order to fool the others.
No one must find out before the preparations have been completed.
Your Majesty, I cannot accept this order!
Abdicate?
That is not possible!
Yes, that is what everyone will say once the decree is announced.
I will consider this a practice session.
Your Majesty!
I made this decision to protect the nation and government.
As a father who wants to protect his children, ...as a husband who wants to protect his wife.
I will not change my mind.
- Good work.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty!
- Are you all right, Your Majesty?
Summon the Royal Physician!
Escort His Majesty!
- Your Majesty!
- I'm fine.
I just got a little dizzy.
It happens often.
I'll be all right once I rest.
You must see the Royal Physician!
Yes, Your Majesty!
You must go to your bedchambers.
I'm fine.
Your Majesty.
The Emissary from Qing has just arrived at the Palace.
Indeed?
Escort him secretly to the Grand Palace.
Yes, Your Majesty.
The Emissary from Qing has reached Onyang, Your Majesty.
Sounds like things are happening faster than expected.
Send in the Royal Physician and announce tomorrow that...
I am going to Onyang to recuperate from weak vitality.
Yes, Your Majesty.
My Lord.
What happened?
Are you saying something is going on?
Yes, My Lord.
- Your Excellency.
- Welcome, Third War Minister.
Do you know His Majesty is leaving the Palace?
He's going to recover from the dizzy spell he showed us that night.
I don't think that's the true reason.
Yes, I'm sure he had another reason.
Don't you know he always goes away before he announces a reform?
Yes, he's planning to dismiss all of Consort Sook's supporters from government.
Yes, the Royal Secretariat has already received decrees for their dismissals.
His Majesty is resolute, Third War Minister.
He's going to cut all of Consort Sook's ties to government.
All of the decrees from the Grand Palace have been kept secret.
But the only ones that were revealed were their dismissals...?
Where did you say that decrees were being sent?
The Office of Special Advisors and Censor-General, ...as well as the Ministry and Bureau of State Records.
But there is no way of knowing what those decrees were.
The Bureau of State Records?
- Strike the place.
- What?
The security there is the lowest out of the four offices.
But My Lord, if something goes wrong...
Things have already gone wrong.
We need to find out what His Majesty's intentions are.
I've come to See His Majesty.
He has already left the Palace, Your Highness.
But he was supposed to leave at 9 am.
He was, but he left at 7 am.
He left this for you, Your Highness.
This will be a long journey.
So by the time I return, you will have left the Palace.
But don't forget.
Don't forget my promise that I will be there with you.
You turned away from the position of Queen, ...in order to protect the Crown Prince, Prince Yeon Ing and me.
And now it's my turn.
But for me, I am not losing anything, but gaining something immeasurable.
I get to live the rest of my life together with you.
Have faith in me and be patient, Dong Yi.
I won't let anyone get hurt.
That dream that you had...
I will fulfill that dream for you.
Your Majesty...
- Is the Qing Emissary here?
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty!
You've had a long journey.
Please have a seat.
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir!
Did you say abdicate, Your Majesty?
I asked you to come here because I have a request for the Emperor.
Yes, Your Majesty.
This is it.
His Majesty's secret decree asked for this book.
This is a record of King Taejo and King Taejong.
His Majesty wanted a compilation of these records?
Yes, My Lord.
King Taejo and King Taejong?
Why?
Wait, that means...!
It can't be...!
- What is it, My Lord?
- A horse!
I need to meet the Councilor!
Yes, My Lord!
What...!
- What is this?
- This was it.
His Majesty's decision.
He's going to abdicate, Excellency!
Impossible!
How could that be?
His Majesty intends to make the Crown Prince King, ...and Prince Yeon Ing Heir Successor.
He has gone away to create the foundation for his abdication.
You must stop him!
You must prevent Prince Yeon Ing from becoming King.
Councilor!
- Make sure security is seamless!
- Yes, My Lord!
If Prince Yeon Ing becomes Heir Successor and Consort Sook wields power, everything is finished.
The first thing she'll do is to block my path.
But there is always a way out.
Opportunity and danger are both in front of me.
- My Lord, what do you intend to do?
- His Majesty is not in the Palace.
The Crown Prince is ill as well.
That means the Queen holds the ultimate power.
And the Queen is in my hand.
I'll use her to strike everyone down.
Not only Consort Sook and Prince Yeon Ing but all of her supporters!
I'll strike them all down together!
Abdicate?
Master, that cannot happen!
Why?
You need to be ready for it when it happens.
Master?
Both King Taejo and King Taejong abdicated their thrones.
So why do you say that cannot happen?
Master, how can you say that as a loyal subject?
I've foregone my duty as a loyal subject years ago.
The only thing that matters to me is practicality.
Based on that, His Majesty's decision is a wise one.
Even though he may abdicate, he will still stand behind the Crown Prince.
He'll handle state matters until the Crown Prince finds his own footing.
If the Crown Prince becomes King,
Then Prince Yeon Ing can become Heir Successor.
Don't you understand that...
His Majesty is trying to fulfill Consort Sook's dream of protecting everyone?
- You saw a falling star?
- Yes.
They say a falling star is a bad omen.
I heard that the people believe that those who witness it will die.
My Lord, why are you saying such things?
Don't worry.
I'm just talking nonsense.
In any case, I'm worried because...
All the guards have left the Palace including the Royal Guard.
The Palace is in the highest amount of danger when His Majesty is away from it.
Inspector Cha is still in the Palace.
Please don't worry too much.
Where are the guards who were on duty at the Bureau of State Records?
- Search for them!
- Yes, sir!
This is...!
Are you sure?
Consort Sook is hatching a devious plan?
Yes, My Lord.
We don't have concrete evidence, but there is something in the works.
- Lord Jang!
- Third War Minister!
What can we do to help?
There is suspicious activity going on.
Dispatch the solders to Consort Sook's Palace!
I gave you an order!
Forgive me, sir, but I don't think that's possible.
What?
We received orders not to take any from you.
That's not all.
The guards from the Five Commands have replaced the Royal Guard in the Palace.
We received orders to take the command only from Lord Jang, Third War Minister.
Jang Mu-Ryeol?
Who gave you this order?
It was I. I gave this order, Inspector!
- Tribunal Commissioner!
- Is there a problem?
- Sir!
- What did you find, Lieutenant?
The Ministry of War is the same.
He's given the command of all the armies to Lord Jang.
Sir, without the Royal Guard here,
The only soldiers are from the Tribunal and the War Ministry.
But...
But now they are all under Lord Jang's command.
That's right.
Even the armies of the Five Commands.
Now all I have to do is move the Queen.
- Your Highness!
- What is it?
You need to come outside.
Her Majesty is here.
- The Queen?
- Yes, Your Highness.
What could she want at this hour?
Consort Sook!
- I came to confirm something with you.
- Your Majesty.

Episode 45
Look at the horses!
Look at the horses!
You up there!
Come down this instant!
You little rascals!
You little scoundrels!
How dare you interrupt the nobles!
You need to be beaten!
- Come here, you rascal!
- Let go of him!
You appear to be an educated scholar.
But how can your language and actions be so crude?
Wh...what...?
The great Taegong once said,
One should not belittle others while considering oneself to be precious,
And one should not insult others for their weakness while considering oneself to be great.
You may be a noble,
But how dare you beat a child in such a violent manner?
- Release the child!
- You rascal!
How dare a lowborn child talk to me in this manner!
You deserve a beating to come to your senses!
Men, seize that child!
Halt!
I am a Prince!
Did you not hear me?
I am a Royal Prince!
(Prince Yeon Ying
- The future King Yeongjo)
- Geum!
- Mother!
What happened?
What are you doing here?
I was watching the procession with some children, ...but that nobleman began beating them.
- So...
- Are you this brat's mother?
- I asked you if you are his mother!
- That is so.
By what you're wearing,
My son seems to have been correct in that you are a scholar.
What?
Then you should also know that a Royal Consort is living in the city.
- Am I right?
- What?
A Royal Consort?
I have never heard of such nonsense!
You knave!
Do you dare mock the monarchy?
Do you want to be dragged to the dungeons for your crime of disrespect towards the Royal Family?
Don't say such things...!
Then... who are you?
Did I not just tell you who I am?
Then you mean...
you're the Royal Consort?
Please forgive me!
Pardon me, Your Highness.
What should I do with him?
Please forgive me, Your Highness!
I deserve death!
Please forgive me!
I have caused you great trouble with my foolishness!
Your Highness?
It's all right.
It's not a big incident.
Send him back and take the children home.
Yes, Your Highness!
Please forgive me!
Please forgive me!
- My Lord!
Are you all right?
- Let go!
How was I supposed to know who they are..
...when they're dressed like beggars?
But how peculiar...
How can a boy who looks only around 7 or 8 recite Taegong's works?
What?
What are you talking about, My Lord?
Forget it.
Would you know if I told you?
Let's go.
Geum!
Mother, are the children who were with me safe?
Yes, they will be fine.
But why are you here without Lady Bong or Ae-Jong?
- What...?
- Did you trick them again?
- Mother, I...
- Geum, what did I tell you?
I told you to always tell the attendants where you're going!
Why have you done this again!
- I am going to have to punish you!
- What?
Punish me?
Raise your arms higher!
Who are you looking at?
Don't look at them.
No one will help you today.
- Don't look at him.
- Yes, Your Highness.
You do the same thing, but you're punishing him...
Lady Bong!
Your Highness, it's been over an hour.
You should stop...
Stop?
I'm just getting started.
- It will be a full two hours today!
- Mother...!
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
- Come with me.
- Mother?
- Your Highness!
- She won't do anything else, will she?
- Have you eaten?
- Not yet...
There's a place that serves great soup.
Let's go and get some.
Mother, where are we going?
- Are we going to the tigers?
- What?
I heard that parents ask tigers to take their children away when they don't listen.
So you know that you've done wrong?
Yes, Mother.
I won't do it again.
Fine.
Since you acknowledge you were wrong,
I will tell the tigers to go back home.
Because you did a good thing by standing up for the weak.
Mother!
Let's go!
Be careful.
Sit here.
- Look down there, Geum.
- Mother!
You can see well from here, right?
I used to bring my friends here to watch the processions.
- You did?
- That's right.
I used to be their leader!
What?
How can a girl be a leader?
What did I tell you?
Being born a woman or a lowborn does not make one incapable.
Yes, I forgot.
You said what's important is a person's ability, not his status.
That's right.
Wow!
Mother, look over there!
Geum, you know what you said to that scholar?
- Did you learn that at school?
- No, I read it in a book in your room.
- You read one of my books?
- Yes, Mother.
Mother, those Emissaries must be on their way to the Palace, right?
Probably.
Then they'll be seeing Father soon.
Geum...
Mother, won't you tell me about Father again?
- About Father?
- Yes, I love it when you talk about him!
Yes, let's do that.
What story do you want to hear today?
Your Majesty...
It is time for the Emissary's banquet.
All right.
Let's go.
His Majesty the King!
Father.
Your Majesty.
Let's begin.
I heard you went sightseeing with the Crown Prince.
- Did you enjoy yourself?
- Of course, Your Majesty.
His Highness showed us the sights and also composed a poem for us.
(Crown Prince Yoon, the Future King Gyeongjong)
- Indeed?
- Yes, Father.
Seeing the Crown Prince,
I can only expect bright and positive things on Joseon's future, Your Majesty!
- Are you unwell, my son?
- No, Father.
- My son!
- Your Highness!
Take His Highness in!
Call the Royal Physician now!
Are you all right, my son?
Call the physician immediately!
Your Highness!
Hurry!
Your Highness!
What happened?
Why did the Crown Prince collapse?
He lost consciousness during the banquet.
Please don't worry, Your Highness.
It appears to be from dizziness.
Brother...!
I need to speak to Her Highness in private.
Yes, My Lord.
Who is the physician with him?
Don't worry, Your Highness.
We sent for Physician Nam.
The physician says it is nothing to worry about, Your Majesty.
Indeed?
Physician Nam said that it was mild fatigue.
Wait, did you just say Physician Nam?
Yes, Your Majesty.
What is it, My Queen?
It's nothing, Your Majesty.
The Crown Prince has been pale these days.
Tell them to use all their efforts.
Yes, Your Majesty.
How is the Crown Prince's condition?
- The dizziness is...
- You know I'm not talking about that!
Tell us!
Has his condition deteriorated?
His Highness is weak, ...and none of the tonics we tried have had any effect.
What?
No effect?
- Then you mean...?
- It's too early to say, but...
If he does not recuperate soon, he may never have descendents!
Physician Nam!
What...?
Your Highness!
Your Majesty, why do you think it odd that Physician Nam is taking care of the Crown Prince?
His Majesty specifically sent for the Royal Physician today.
It just seems strange that they would deliberate turn that down and ask for Physician Nam.
Isn't that because...
Physician Nam has been taking care of the Crown Prince all his life?
That's exactly what Her Majesty is suspicious about, Minister.
By right, the Crown Prince is taken care of by the Royal Physician.
By for the past few months,
Consort Hui has been summoning Physician Nam instead.
Consort Hui has staked everything on the Crown Prince.
So why would she turn away the Royal Physician and seek a mid-level physician?
We are putting our faith in you, Physician Nam.
- You must obtain this herb.
- Yes, My Lord.
You must watch Physician Nam carefully, Brother!
This must never be leaked out.
If there is ever any suspicion, I will not hesitate to silence him.
If that herb cannot be found in Joseon, then we must seek it in Qing.
It may be found there!
Your Highness, you must restrain yourself.
- He is still young.
When he recovers...
- I know that.
But what if His Majesty finds out?
What if he finds out that the future King may not be able to sire any children?
That may put the Crown Prince's position in danger!
Your Highness, you're taking it too far.
Who can replace the Crown Prince in the Palace?
Someone outside the Palace can.
- Consort Chun's prince.
- But Your Highness...
His Majesty has not sought out Consort Chun in six years.
That means he has abandoned the prince as well.
You must get her out of your mind.
You've been worried about her for six years.
His Majesty didn't seek her out once during that time.
But what if he has missed her all this time?
What?
What if he's been waiting for the time when he can call her back to the Palace?
- Your Highness!
- I know!
But His Majesty is a strong man.
He may have been able to cut her off as he did to me.
But what if he had unwillingly endured this past six years?
And what if Consort Chun returns to the Palace with her son?
It seems there are organizations hoarding copper and scapolite again.
I will conduct a secret inspection of the Bureau of Capital Markets tomorrow.
- Make the necessary preparations.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, the night grows deep.
- Please retire to your bedchambers.
- I'm all right.
Don't worry about me.
But...
I'm fine.
Leave me.
I will summon you if I need you.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Your Highness!
Be quiet!
Your Highness!
Your Highness!
Mother is thinking about Father right now.
What?
It's all my fault.
I begged her to tell me about him today.
That's why she's become sad.
Your Highness...
Mother said she did a great wrong to Father.
She said she made Father sad.
Lady Bong, do you know what that was?
Do you know what she did that made Father so angry?
- Your Highness...
- Your Highness...
Your Majesty...
Recites classical teachings...
Amongst all living things, none is greater than man.
And man is greatest because of the five reasons.
The five reasons!
If you are so tired, shall I give you a room?
No, Master, I'm all right!
As a Royal Prince,
Shouldn't you set an example amongst these sons of noblemen?
Yes, Master!
Shall we move on.
Not all Princes are the same.
His mother is a lowborn.
- She was a slave in the Palace.
- Really?
That's right!
And she was kicked out because she committed a crime!
Your Highness, what are you looking for?
Have you seen "The Doctrine of the Mean" and "The Great Learning"?
I'm sure I left them here.
I think I saw them in the Prince's room.
In the Prince's room?
When one's parents call out, one should run to them immediately.
When they give a command,
One should do it quickly and without hesitation.
When one sits before one's parents, do not sit idly or lay down before them.
If he's part lowborn, how can he even learn like the rest of us?
And how can he still be a Prince when he's been kicked out?
You knaves!
How dare you!
What is this?
The others were talking about me and...
First you sleep during class, and now you pay attention to such nonsense!
That's why you still haven't mastered "Elementary Learning" yet!
I've already finished "Elementary Learning".
I've also read "The Doctrine of the Mean" and "The Great Learning".
I can recite "Elementary Learning" by heart,
But you keep teaching us the same thing over and over...
Now you make up this foolishness to excuse yourself!
- You may be a Royal Prince, but...!
- All you have to do is test me, Master.
Why do you say I'm making things up without asking me?
Fine, Your Highness.
Then I will begin my questions.
This question will be regarding the chapter on entering school.
- The six virtues are...
- The six virtues are wisdom, grace, ...integrity, loyalty, courage, and tranquility.
Fine, then next it will be the chapter on wise teachings.
A good man must...
A good man must have a mind deep and wide.
His mind must be as water.
That's amazing!
Now then, I'll ask about good works!
- A Qin man named...
- A Qin man named Wang Yun said,
When one serves one's parents, ensure the face is peaceful and at peace.
- He really knows it!
- He's really amazing!
Why are all these books here?
I doubt Ae-Jong put them here by mistake.
You mean it was Geum who put them here?
It wasn't me or Ae-Jong, so yes.
I wonder why?
He can't possibly be reading them.
Maybe he used them as pillows?
Geum, you know what you said to that scholar?
- Did you learn that at school?
- No, I read it in a book in your room.
It is possible that Geum has read these...?
But how?
He's so strange!
It's you!
Have you recovered from that beating?
- Your Highness...
- Be quiet!
The others might hear you!
What are you doing here?
Were you on your way somewhere?
You mean you didn't teach the Prince anything privately?
That's right.
I did teach him some "Elementary Learning" due to his quick learning.
But I didn't do much because I thought it would be better if he learnt it at school.
Then you mean he learned everything by himself?
Even the "Doctrine of the Mean" and "The Greater Learning"?
"Doctrine of the Mean" and "The Greater Learning"?
Yes, Your Highness.
It wasn't just "Elementary Learning".
I was so surprised that I questioned him,
And he has mastered both of those books.
What?
A feast at the Palace?
Yes, the King holds a feast for lowborn children every year at the Palace!
And the children in our village are going!
That's right!
The Palace...?
It smells so good!
Let us in!
You're going to go in with us, Your Highness?
You're going in like that, Your Highness?
Don't call me Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
- Don't I look like a lowborn like this?
Your Highness...
I'm going to meet my father when I go into the Palace.
I have something to tell him.
- Come children, you may enter.
- Let's go!
Goodness!
Why are you alone again?
Where's His Highness?
- My Lady...!
- What?
Has he run away again?
That's not the end of it.
This is a major disaster!
Major disaster?
Has the Prince been hurt?
What did you say, Lady Bong?
- The Prince has been hurt?
- Your Highness!
- Ae-Jong!
- No, Your Highness, that's not it.
His Highness has gone to the Palace!
- What?
- What?
The Palace?
Yes, I asked the children at school where he went and...
And...
So this is the Palace.
This is where Father lives!
Your Highness, the palace is huge!
- I'm getting dizzy it's so big!
Right, Your Highness?
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
Where did he go?
Father will be at the Grand Palace.
Your Majesty, it's almost time.
Is it?
Wait a moment.
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!
Lady Jung!
Lady Nam!
Lady Yu is searching for the Prince with the girls.
Inspector Shim is also meeting with Chief Suh to seek his help, Your Highness.
- What?
The Prince is in the Palace?
- Yes, My Lord.
It will cause a commotion if his presence is known.
We must find him immediately!
- Officer Nam.
Officer Hwang.
- Yes, My Lord!
Let's go!
Consort Hui must not know about this.
Search for the Prince in absolute secrecy!
Yes, My Lady!
Not here?
I'm going to go crazy!
Let's go!
Sir!
- He's not over there.
- Then go to the Grand Palace.
Hurry!
Yes, sir.
Let's go!
The Grand Palace?
That's it!
That's where Father is!
It's the dragon emblem!
That's Father!
Father!
- Who goes there?
- Let me through!
Father!
- What are you doing?
- Let me go!
I have to see Father!
Father!
- The Crown Prince?
- His Majesty the King!
- Your Majesty.
- My Queen.
What is causing this commotion?
Forgive me, Your Highness.
But this child was causing a disturbance and we were...
Did you call me "Father"?
I'm certain that's what you were saying.
I...
I...
You are a young lowborn boy and don't know this.
But only Royal Princes can call the King "Father".
You can be taken away and beaten for that so you must be careful.
I hear there is a banquet for lowborn children in the Palace today.
He must lost his way.
Return him to the banquet.
Yes, Your Highness.
- Let's go.
- I am not a lowborn!
And I know that only Royal Princes can call the King "Father".
- I am...
- Crown Prince!
Mother.
What is going on here, Crown Prince?
What is this?
Who is this child?
This boy was trespassing and blocked His Highness' path.
What?
Then why hasn't he been taken away yet?
How dare a mere lowborn child enter the Palace and block the path of the Crown Prince?
Take him away and beat him severely...
Let us not trouble ourselves any further with this.
- Send him on his way like I ordered.
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Let's go!
- Let go of me!
I said let go!
Let's go.
Get out of here, you rascal!
I have to go in!
I have to see His Majesty!
Look at this lunatic!
You must have lost your mind!
Leave before we give you a beating!
Let me in!
I'm a Prince!
I said I'm a Prince!
I have to see Father!
I have to!
I have to see Father!
Geum...
Tell the Bureau of Capital Markets to hand over all records of copper intake and output.
Order the Tribunal to monitor all the officers dismissed from the Bureau.
Yes, Your Majesty.
- What is that sound?
- Your Majesty?
Father...!
Why are you crying in this place?
Your Highness!
I may not be able to enter the Palace, but I can search outside.
I'm going there now!
But what if someone sees you when you're there?
Your Highness!
- What if someone sees her?
- I don't know!
Here, take this.
Go on.
I heard a strange sound, and here I found a little puppy.
A long time ago,
I found a very pretty puppy here in this same spot.
So if you're finished crying, will you get up?
You seem to have lost your way.
I'll have someone take you home.
- You...
- Who are you?
You seem to be a man of character.
Tell me, what is your name?
What did you say?
I do not wish to forget you.
So worry not, and tell me your name.
What an impudent rascal you are.
What did you say?
How dare you call me a rascal?
Do you know who I am?
You little...!
Fine then.
Who are you?
I am a Royal Prince!
Do you understand?
I may look like this, but I am His Majesty's Royal son!
Geum!
Geum...!
Wait.
What did you just say?
- Who are you?
- A Royal Prince!
If you're a Prince, then you must be...!
- Geum!
Geum!
- Mother!
- Geum!
- Mother!
Geum!
Your...
Your Majesty!
Geum!
Are you all right?
Have you been hurt in any way?
No, Mother.
I'm so sorry!
No, Geum!
Thank you for being safe!
Thank you for coming back!
Thank you for being safe!
Dong Yi...!
Where have you been?
And what happened to your face?
- You may retire for the night.
- Yes, Your Highness.
Geum, you need to sleep too.
You must be exhausted, right?
Mother, why aren't you angry with me?
Mother...
Because I know.
I know why you did it.
But Geum, you must never do that again.
You must never go to the Palace again.
But I wanted to see Father and beg him to forgive you.
I wanted to see Father up close for once.
Geum...
But Geum, you must know that if you do this, Father will suffer.
Why?
Why can't I see Father?
Why will Father suffer if I see him?
That's because you are so adorable.
If Father sees you,
He won't be able to let you go.
Then like a long time ago,
He will suffer again.
Come here.
Geum...
I'm a Royal Prince!
I may look like this, but I am His Majesty's Royal son!
Geum!
- Your Majesty...
- You saw her too?
She was right there in front of me.
And Geum, that child, was in front of me.
Do you know how much I missed her?
Do you know how I longed to embrace that child?
Your Majesty...!
How big he has grown!
How he has grown!
- Did you find out anything?
- Yes, My Lady.
Physician Nam was purchasing herbs separately and giving them to the Crown Prince.
- Are you certain?
- Yes, one of his nurses told me.
Consort Hui is hiding something.
The Crown Prince must be suffering from a condition that cannot be revealed.
This is the herb from Qing.
Deliver this to Her Highness.
Yes, Madam.
Are you out of your mind?
Ho-Yang, have you gone insane?
I came to this decision after much deliberation!
Don't try to stop me, Mother!
Much deliberation?
And the conclusion was to ruin the family?
What about your position?
Who cares about that low-level government job?
- What?
- I don't care about that.
All I want to do is keep that girl.
Ho-Yang!
Ho-Yang!
He's finally lost his mind!
Woe is me!
Ae-Jong!
How can she be so beautiful even though six years have passed?
You must be a fairy!
What do you feel like eating today?
Yes.. yes...!
I will take care of you when His Majesty has discarded you!
I won't abandon you even if you sell off this nation!
Dong Yi!
Come here!
You've finally lost your senses!
What?
Kidnap?
You're going to kidnap Consort Chun?
No, Father, not right now.
I'm going to do it at night.
You lunatic!
I'm not talking about night or day!
You lunatic!
You fool!
You lunatic!
I know you love your women.
But how can you think about kidnapping a Royal Consort?
Then what am I supposed to do?
She's all alone and it's driving me crazy!
- I keep thinking about her!
- What did you say?
Father, it's been six years!
His Majesty has forgotten about her!
No one will look for her even if she disappears!
I will.
I'll look for her!
- Father!
- Shut your mouth and come with me!
What?
Kidnap her?
I'll kidnap you!
Come with me!
Lady Bong.
- Yes, Your Highness?
- Bring Geum here.
Yes, Your Highness.
Yesterday, I met with the school master.
What?
- And he said something strange.
- Mother, that's...
That's because I find "Elementary Learning" was boring.
No, Geum, I'm not talking about that.
What?
These books.
Did you take them from my room?
- Yes.
- Why?
To read.
I had already memorized "Elementary Learning" when you taught it to me.
So...
So you read these books by yourself?
Both the "Greater Learning" and "Doctrine of the Mean"?
Yes.
Then will you show me what you know?
Yes, Mother.
This is the "Greater Learning".
Recites verse from "The Greater Learning"
What is its meaning?
If it is not in one's heart, one cannot see it.
One cannot hear it, nor can one taste it.
